Lordship Lane, from Pellatt Road to Heber Road In conjunction with the "New Streets" work (footways only) of this thoroughfare, the Roadway also was widened by the Vestry, Land on the east side having been given up to the Public, which work of Road Improvement has been executed 47 by the Vestry staff. Channelling also has been laid in the water tables of this newly-formed portion of Lordship Lane. Alleyn Park, from Park Road to Union Road. The Roadway of this thoroughfare (in conjunction with the "New Streets" work of the footways) has been widened, the work being executed by the Vestry staff, the cost of the increased width of Footway being jointly borne by the Dulwich College Authorities and the Vestry. High Street, Peckham, south side, next to and adjoining east of Basing Road. New Houses and Shops being about to be erected here, an improvement was effected by the surrender to the Public by the Owner, of a slip of land between the old and new lines of Frontage. The former line inconveniently projected on to the direct line of the Public way. East Dulwich Grove, south side, in front of (late) "Clumber House," now the premises of the "Constitutional Club." Through the liberal offer of J. Blundell Maple, Esq., M.P., to give up a portion of ground in front of this Club House, in order that the Roadway might be widened to meet an Improvement line already commenced, the Vestry accepted the same, and executed the necessary work of kerbing and road-paving work thereto : and contributed also the sum of £30 towards the expences incurred by Mr. Maple in re-erecting the fence wall next the Public Way. The Freehold of the Land given up was duly dedicated to the Vestry. It is regretted that the Vestry have as yet been unable to make arrangements with the Owner of the adjacent premises, "The Chestnuts," to accomplish a similar object, and thereby complete this much desired Improvement. In various parts of the Parish, several minor Improvements have been carried out where Shop Fronts, &c., have 48 been brought out in advance of the General Line of adjoining Buildings—by sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works— on condition that small portions of Land be given up to widen the Public footway adjacent thereto, which have been claimed and paved by the Vestry.

The following is a schedule of the streets re-named and re-numbered during the past year, in accordance with orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works, notices have been served, and the alterations made in accordance therewith and a Report, when complete, shewing that the same has been carried out, is in each case forwarded to the Metropolitan Board. re-numbered only. re-named only.

PALIAMENTARY DEPOSITATIONS, &c. Session 1888-89. The following Schemes received the consideration of your Committee upon the Report of your Surveyor, a copy of which Report is as follows : "SOUTHWARK & DEPTFORD TRAMWAYS." W. Shelford, Engineer. Sutton & Ommaney, Solicitors for the Bill, 3 4, Great Winchester Street, E.C. Sherwood & Co., Parliamentary Agents, 7, Great George Street, Westminster. "Tramway No. 4." This is a proposed line of Tramway commencing in Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, passing into and along St. 50 James's Road, over the South Eastern Railway ("Bricklayer's Arms" Branch), crossing Rolls Road and entering this Parish in St. James Road, at Parish Boundary, running along such road and terminating by a loop junction with the present Tramway line at the intersection of Rotherhithe New Road with St. James Road. This line is a single line with loops as follows:— single Line. Chains. Double Line. Chains. Gradients. From Parish Boundary to Bonamy street 2.20 1 in 332 From Bonamy street to opposite No. 327, St. James's Road 2.5 1 in 860 From No. 327, to opposite Rotherhithe New Road 4.5 1 in 860 1 in 1085 1 in 125 From opposite Rotherhithe New Road to junction with present line — 1.58 1 in 56 1 in 40 Total Length single portion 6.45 3.83 Do. do. Double or loop portion - 3.83 Total length of "No. 4" Tramway in Camberwell Parish 10.28 Chains. 51 Where the loop line is proposed near Bonamy street, there will be a portion on the East side only of the road which will be at a less distance than the statutory width (9-ft. 6-in.), viz.:—5-ft. 6½-in. between the outside of the footpath and the nearest rail of the Tramway. At the loop and at the junction referred to, it will be necessary for the Vestry to insist upon the entire width of the carriageway to be paved with granite pitching, and that the portion of the loop line immediately adjacent to the urinal should be placed at such a distance therefrom as hereafter may be arranged with the Vestry. "Tramway No. 25." Proposed junction of present Tramway in St. James's Road with the Tramway in Old Kent Road, next Canal Bridge. This is a proposed junction with the existing Tramway of the Southwark and Deptford Tramway Company at a point 23 yards northward from its present termination in the St. James Road, next Old Kent road, with the existing lines of the London Tramways Company Limited, at a point 10 yards measured in a north-westerly direction from the centre of Canal Bridge, Old Kent road. This will be a double line about 2.20 chains in length of the several gradients of 1 in 23, 1 in 20, 1 in 26, and 1 in 40, and will be at a less width than the statutory width on the East side. The usual powers for the protection of the Vestry should be embodied in the Act. 52 SHORTLANDS AND NUNHEAD RAILWAY. John Wolfe Barry, Engineer. Radcliffes & Cator, Solicitors for the Bill, 20, Craven Street, Strand. Rees & Frere, Parliamentary Agents, 13, Gt. George Street. This is a proposed Railway from Shortlands in the Parish of Beckenham, Kent, to Nunhead Station in the Parishes of St. Paul Deptford, and St. Giles Camberwell. This will necessitate altering and enlarging the platforms, &c., of the Nunhead Railway Station, but will in no way interfere with any public road or thoroughfare in this Parish. J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor. 10th December, 1888. The above Report was presented to and received the approval of the Vestry on the 19th December last. TRAMWAYS. The Line of Tramways laid some three years since from the southern end of Rye Lane, opposite Heaton Road, passing along the west side of Peckham Rye to East Dulwich Road, thence along East Dulwich Road to and along Crystal Palace Road to Lordship Lane, and along Lordship Lane in a 53 easterly direction as far as The Plough public-house, was inspected and passed in August last by Major General Hutchinson of the Board of Trade, your Surveyor, the Engineer to the Company, and several Members of the Vestry being present. The result of this inspection was that certain alterations and improvements were suggested by Major General Hutchinson, to be executed to the satisfaction of the Surveyor to the Vestry previously to the Board of Trade granting the certificate of the line being in working order. These alterations were duly carried out by the Tramway Company to your Surveyor's satisfaction, and he reported the same to the Board of Trade in accordance with their request, and the authority of the Vestry, and subsequently received a letter from the Secretary of the Board of Trade, acknowledging the Report and informing him that the Board of Trade had accordingly certified such lines to be fit for public traffic. Notwithstanding all these tentative arrangements being disposed of, it is regrettable that this line remains unused. With regard to that portion of the proposed London, Camberwell, and Dulwich Tramways, in Rye Lane, it will be remembered that the Vestry in July last, after mature deliberation, arrived at the following resolutions, viz.:— " That upon the London, Camberwell, and Dulwich " Tramways acquiring the Land coloured red on the " plan marked B, deposited with the Clerk of the " Vestry (see Vestry Minute Book of that date), and " upon their conveying the same without cost to the " Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, for the use of the " public for ever, and upon such Tramway being con- 54 " structed at the northern end of Rye Lane, as shewn " on a plan marked C, also deposited with the Clerk of " the Vestry (that shewn in dotted green lines not to be " constructed without the Vestry's consent), and upon " the undertaking of the said Tramway Company to " open the already existing lines from "The Plough," " Lordship Lane, to the "Heaton Arms," Peckham " Rye, within two months of the sealing of the consent " of the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board of Works, " the consent of this Vestry be given to the construction " and opening of the Tramway through Rye Lane in " accordance and compliance with the existing Acts of " Parliament in that behalf." " That the seal of the Vestry shall not be affixed to " such resolutions, nor shall such resolutions when " sealed be delivered out of the Vestry until the said " Company have entered into an agreement with the " Vestry that they the Company will when required " by the Vestry or a Local Authority, within two years " from the opening of the said Tramway, apply to " Parliament for powers to acquire the land coloured " green and blue on the said deposited plan, marked B, " and that upon powers being granted to the Company " to acquire such land without having to acquire other " land from the respective owners thereof, will at their " own expense acquire the same, or so much thereof " as shall not have become public highway, and will, " free of cost, convey the land so acquired to the Vestry " of St. Giles, Camberwell, for the use of the public for " ever." The Company not having obtained the land to widen 55 Rye Lane between Heaton Road and Choumert Road, they made an application in September last to the Vestry for an extension of the Tramway already constructed from "The Plough" publichouse, Lordship Lane, to Choumert Road, by connecting the same with a Tramway to be laid through that part of Rye Lane extending from Choumert Road to High Street, Peckham. This application was approved by the Vestry as a means of connecting East Dulwich District with Peckham, and conducing thereby to the convenience of the inhabitants generally, the Vestry recommended such application to the favourable consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works. For this purpose a deputation of the Vestry attended the Metropolitan Board of Works in October last, urging the Board to consent to the proposal; it was referred to the Works Committee, who reported to the Board their opinion that they considered it would not be consistent with the provisions of the Peckham and East Dulwich Tramways Act of 1885 that the Board should consent to the proposal inasmuch as the 5th Section of the Act of 1885 provided " that no part of the Tramway in Rye Lane should be " constructed unless and until Rye Lane had been widened " to the satisfaction of the Board and the Vestry of "Camberwell." Therefore for the present the matter remains stationary. CANTERBURY ROAD BRIDGE. The building of this Bridge is now in hand, the tract having been let by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 8th October last, to Messrs. Webster, this Vestry has contributed the sum of £1,400 towards the cost of this structure. The Greenwich Board of Works are also contributors thereto. 56 YORK STONE PAVING & GRANITE PITCHING. General Works. The Repairs of the paved footways and crossings throughout the Parish, including those tated by the Company's openings for laying Gas and Water Mains, Services, and House supplies have been executed by the Staff in the Vestry employ, the material being purchased by contract. The Repairs to these trenches are charged to the respective Companies. The approximate quantity of New Material used during the year was as follows:— York Paving 13,802 feet sup. Kerb 933 „ run. Granite Pitching 635 yds. sup. TAR PAVING. The Tar-paved footpaths continue to be repaired by the Vestry workmen, including also the repairs of trenches opened by Gas and Water Companies, builders and others. The quantity of such work during the past year has been as under:— General Repairs to Tar-paved Footpaths, viz: bottoming and topping (including trenches) 17,560 yds. sup. Ditto, topping only 1,529 „ Ditto, painting and shelling 61,757 „ 57 LIGHTING. Many additions have been made in the number of lamps, as also removals in the positions of those existing, improving generally the lighting of the Parish. The following will shew the additions and alterations referred to:— Company providing the supply No. of Lamps lighted at Lady-day, 1888. New Lamps erected in year ending Lady-day, 1889. Total No. of ordinary lamps at Lady-day 1889. South Metropolitan Gas Company 3,121 74 3,195 Crystal Palace District Gas Compauy 197 — 197 3,318 74 3,392 In addition to the ordinary lamps the following ornamental and central lamps are lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company:— 1 at Peckham rye, west side, at junction with Barry road. 1 at Goose green, at junction of roads next Lordship lane. 1 at Knatchbull road, opposite Flodden road. 1 at Lordship lane, opposite Dulwich Common road. 1 at Camberwell green Urinal. 1 at Hill street Urinal. 1 at High street, Peckham, opposite Rye lane. 1 at Southampton street, next Peckham road. 1 at Thurlow road, by Gallery road. 1 at Dulwich common, by Alleyn park, 58 Also special lamps of various power, viz.:— 1 Bigg's patent in Church street. 5 Bray's ,, at Camberwell green. 1 ,, ,, at Church street, next Camberwell grove. The charge tor the gas supplied to the ordinary lamps is as follows:— South Metropolitan gas company £3 3s. 9d. per lamp Crystal Palace Gas Company - £3 14s. 0d. per annum. Note.—These charges are subject to 5 per cent. discount, conditionally that the accounts are paid within one month of each Quarter-day. The charge for Gas supplied to central and special lamps (varying according to their illuminating power and quantity of gas consumed) is regulated by meter at the rate of 2s. 3d. per 1,000 cubic feet, being a recent reduction of 2d. per 1,000 feet. The above prices include the supply of gas, also the lighting, painting, cleansing, and keeping the lamps and columns in repair. The ordinary lamp columns and lanterns are provided, fixed, and charged for, by the respective Companies, remaining the property of the Vestry, thus:— South Metropolitan Gas Company £2 7s. 3d. Crystal Palace Gas Company £2 10s. 0d. 59 NEW ROADS AND FOOTWAYS. In accordance with the Metropolis Management Acts, and the Bye-laws of the Metropolitan Board, six applications for new Roads were referred by the Metropolitan Board for the opinion of this Vestry. The same were viewed and reported upon by the Surveyor, and after certain modifications the Vestry recommended the Board to approve five and refuse one application. refuse one application. The Board approved of four and refused two. NAMES OF STREETS. Decision of Metropolitan Board of Works. Recommendation of Vestry.

The Metropolitan Board of Works submitted for the opinion of the Vestry 26 applications for lines of frontage, projections, &c., which have been examined and reported on by the Surveyor; the Vestry recommenpdude approval of e 60 21 cases and refusal of 5 cases. The Metropolitan Board ot Works and London County Council consented to 17 and refused 9. It may be well for the information of the Building Public, as regards Lines of Frontage, to record the following. Your Committee received a letter from the Superintending Architect stating that the Metropolitan Board's attention had been directed to the erection of a building at the corner of Avondale and Copleston Roads, Peckham, in advance of the buildings in the latter road. The Building in question faces Avondale Road, and is built upon a corner piece of land next Copleston Road, and your Committee were advised by the Vestry Clerk that in the case of Gilbert v. Wandsworth Board of Works, Lord Coleridge had very recently decided that buildings were governed by the general building line in both streets, consequently this building, although in a line with the building in Avondale Road, is beyond the building line of Copleston Road, and therefore the Magistrate would make an order for the demolition of such part as is in advance of the general building line of Copleston Road. Your Committee were of opinion that if such an order were made it would inflict a great hardship on the owner of this corner house, inasmuch as the past practice of the Metropolitan Board of Works permitted erections in a line with the forecourts of adjoining side roads, that is to say, to observe the building line in the road only to which the building fronted, which custom was upheld by the Metropolitan Board inasmuch that they resolved, That no action be taken in the matter, but the Committee wish it to be understood that in future the law, as recently adjudged, will be strictly enforced. 61 DRINKING FOUNTAINS AND CATTLE TROUGHS, The following is a list of the several Drinking Fountains and Cattle Troughs in the Parish, and which are maintained by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains' Association, the Vestry contributing £5 per annum towards the cost of the water supply.

REPORT OF THE PLANT & SCAVENGING COMMITTEE, For the year ending Lady-day, 1889. Plant and Scavenging Committee. SLOPPING, WATERING, DUSTING, &c. This work as execnted by the Vestry plant, &c., has averaged as follows:— PLANT. Horses 88 Light Cart 1 Water Vans 69 Steam Road Rollers 2 Water Carts 7 Corn Van 1 Material Carts 32 Disinfecting Van 1 Slop Carts 40 Do. Trucks 3 Slop Vans 12 Dust Carts 24 Horse Road Brooms 6 Do. Vans 2 FODDER. The fodder consumed per horse per week has been— Clover, Mixture, and Hay 1.64 trusses. Straw (including bedding) 1.52 „ Oats 2.97 bushels. Beans 0.14 „ Bran9.49 lbs. 66 The cost of the same consumed during the year, has amounted to £2,935 12s. 4d., equal to 13s. 6d. per horse per week. In addition to the foregoing, the Vestry plant has been supplemented upon emergency for Road Watering, Cartage, and Dusting by hired Carts, Horses, &c., which has amounted to the sum of £630 13s. 6d. During the past year 11 Horses have died, and 2 were sold being unfit for further Vestry use, representing about 15 per cent. upon the average stud, it has therefore been found necessary to provide for the vacancies so caused, and in order to maintain the efficiency of the work, somewhat to increase the stud, for which purpose authority was given by the Vestry to purchase, and 15 Horses have, since Lady-day, 1889, been bought under such order. Total No. of Horses in stock at Lady-day, 1888 91 Purchased during the year ending Ladyday, 1889 3 94 Horses died during the year ending Ladyday, 1889 13 Total in stock at Lady-day, 1889 81 The death rate in the stud is somewhat high, but is due almost entirely to natural decay, occurring principally in the Dust Department with those horses which had been in the Vestry service almost from the commencement of the Vestry doing their own work. 67 COLLECTION OF SLOP. The quantity of Slop collected was:— Road Slop 27,511 loads. Gulley Slop 3,612 „ Total 31,123 „ (In 1887-8 the quantity was 30,536 loads.) BARGING AWAY SLOP AND ROAD REFUSE. This work has been carried out under contract by Messrs. Shelbourne & Co., of Limehouse; the quantity removed by barge was 24,285½ cart-loads, or 302 barge-loads. The cost of this work during the year has been at the rate of— Per cart-load, delivered direct into barges, 1s. l1d. for the first 3 months, and 2s. 2d. for the last 9 months. (Mem.—A van-load is = 1½ cart loads.) ROAD WATERING. The supply of water, the mileage of roads watered, and the amount paid for water was as follows:— £ s. d. Southwark and Yauxhall Water Company—by meter 551 16 6 Rent of meters. Standposts property of Vestry 114 19 6 Lambeth Water Company—by meter 299 4 5 Rent of meters 66 3 0 Rent of standposts 47 5 0 Kent Water Company—by mileage: about 11 miles 330 0 0 Four Pumps (from Grand Surrey Canal) 31 11 0 Lewisham Board of Works—Sydenham hill (moiety of expenses) 44 13 6 £1,485 12 11 Length of roads watered about 97½ miles.

The Southwark and Vaijxhall Water Co. supply water at 8½d. per 1,000 gallons. The Lambeth Water Co. at 8½d. per 1,000 gallons in the low-level district; 1s. per 1,000 gallons in the midlevel; and 1s. 3d. per 1,000 gallons in the high-level district, near the Crystal Palace. The Kent Water Co. charge about £30 per mile. REMOVAL OF DUST AND HOUSE REFUSE, DUST BARGING, &c. The quantity of dust collected during the past year ending Lady-day, 1889 24,866 loads. Do. do. 1888 24,631 „ Increase on the previous year 235 ,, Of the above quantity 21,570 loads were taken to the Wharf and barged away, the remainder being delivered at private shoots in various parts of the Parish at agreed prices. 69 The number of loads barged away is 3932 in excess of last year. Your Committee with the view of reducing as much as possible the heavy cost of this Barging Work (especially that of the House Dust and Refuse), have taken every opportunity afforded them to deliver Dust, &c., to any one who could within the district of such collection make use of the same, without detriment to the health of the locality where so deposited, thus not only reducing the quantity barged away, but also saving of miles of Cartage from the respective Districts of Collection to the wharf; and in furtherance of this desire to reduce the very large and increasing cost of disposing of the Dust Refuse before referred to, your Committee have been for some time (and now are) engaged in making experiments and arrangements, by which they hope eventually very materially to further decrease the cost of this Department. The dust barging has been earried out by Messrs. Smeed, Dean, & Co., at the rate of 3s. per dust-cart load for the first three months, and 2s. 8d. per dust-cart load for the last nine months. For the convenience and information of the Parishioners, your Committee caused a house to house distribution of Dust Cards to be made, informing the Public of the special days of Collection from their respective localities, and certain! suggestions made as to the consuming of such portion of the house refuse which is burnable, and thus contribute to effect a saving in this work, and conduce to a reduction of the rates. 70 VESTRY'S DEPOTS. Your Committee having had its attention drawn to the additional accommodation required at the several Depots placed under their charge, through the increased work of Slopping, Dusting, Carting, &c., have made alterations and improvements as under:— ADDINGTON SQUARE DEPOT. The small cottage at this wharf which was formerly occupied by the Labourer in charge, but which, since his death, has been used as an office only, has been enlarged and made sufficient for residential occupation by the Superintendent of No. 1 District. The cost of this enlargement has been fully compensated for by doing away with the necessity of a night watchman, the District Superintendent now taking the entire charge of these premises, which in addition to the economy effected by such alteration, enables the Superintendent to more efficiently supervise the work in hand, and protect the plant, material, &c., on this wharf. PECKHAM PARK ROAD DEPOT. Additions have been made to the horse loose boxes, and also the covered and open sheds, for the extension of the work carried on at this wharf. Also necessary repairs to the two cottages on the wharf, one of which is occupied by the Horse-keeper in charge of that portion of the Vestry's Stud kept here ; the other by one of the Vestry employees, who pays rent for the same to the Vestry. 71 GLENGALL ROAD WHARF. The yearly increasing quantity of Slop and Dust brought to this Depot for deportation by Barges has rendered necessary some additional office and other accommodation to be made in order to insure efficient and economical supervision. VICTORIA ROAD DEPOT. Alterations and additions have been made at this Depot, viz., to the Committee Room and also in the Clerk's Office, &c., providing for the increased Committee work which is carried out here by the "Plant Committee," who hold their usual weekly and other meetings at this Depot. The larger portion of the Vestry's Stud is provided for on these premises, including the accommodation for the Veterinary treatment of the Horses; also the Wheelwrights Blacksmiths, and Shoeing Departments. The Forage is also kept in Store at this Depot, the whole of the above being under the care and supervision of the Resident Depot Superintendent. The Masons and Tar Paving Store, for this portion of the Parish is also provided here. HENSLOWE ROAD DEPÔT, EAST DULWICH. The premises purchased at above, as authorised by the Vestry, providing a supplemental Depot for the outlying Southern portion of the Parish, have been fitted up and 72 arranged for the reception and storage of Material, Carts, &c., also Paying the Road Labourers. A District Superintendent resides on these premises, he paying a portion of the rent to the Vestry. DULWICH VILLAGE. A temporary shed Depot is rentod in this locality for similar purposes, as referred to, at Henslowe Road, which is found to be convenient for the organization of the labour, &c., of this portion of the Parish.

The Local Main Sewers are cleansed by the flushers in the employ of the Yestry. The quantity of slop removed from the same during the past year has been 425 cart loads. The Brick Sewer in Dulwich Common road, reported by your Surveyor to be in a dilapidated condition, has been repaired for a length of 1,120 feet, and is now in a satisfactory state. HOUSE DRAINAGE. 159 applications have been received for the drainage of 396 houses into sewers, and the works in connection therewith have been carried out under inspection. This number includes the re-modelling of the drainage of old houses as also the drainage of new property. FLOODINGS. This question is assuming a very serious aspect especially in its consequences which result to the low lying districts of the Metropolis, particularly to properties having cellars and basement floors. The Sewers and Sanitary Committee of this Yestry have had the subject brought before them through the 78 plaints of the suffering inhabitants, and the consequent Reports thereon by your Surveyor, these Reports, after receiving the Vestry's consideration, were transmitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works. Further—On a recent occurrence of fioodings, it was again the subject of appeal to the Vestry, when after an exhaustive discussion, the matter was at once remitted to the London County Council for their consideration. The reports by your Surveyor relating to this subject are here reproduced in order to inform the Parishioners that this subject has not been neglected by the Vestry, and further that the remedy does not lie within the Vestry control. REPORT. To the Sewers and Sanitary Committee:— Re Fioodings on the occasion of Heavy Rainfall on Tuesday night, the 26th June, 1888, also on the Friday following the above date. Heavy rainfall. Having explained somewhat discursively to your Committee on Tuesday evening last on the above subject, when you received the several deputations, and also the many complaints and written communications thereon, I thought it desirable that I should, for your further consideration, condense my statement and explanations of the facts relating to the flooding on Fridav, the 26th June. The rainfall in question, as registered at the Deptford and Crossness outfalls of the Southern Metropolitan Sewers, were respectively 1.75 and 2.10, between the hours of 6.30 79 and 11.0 p.m. I believe however that the principal portion of this rainfall occurred considerably within that period of time. Result of storm on the Low level portions . of the Parish and Metropolis geuerally. The above quoted rainfall, I need not say, was unprecedented, and its immediate result was disastrous in the low lying portions of the Parish, to properties having basements, the very rapid accumulation of water in the Sewers caused the flood level to rise even to the surface of the road in some instances, this being several feet above the level of the Sewers and the basement stories. The flood level spread of course throughout the Parish, blocking up the subsidiary local Sewers, and hence it follows blocked up the course of the surface and house drainage also, and the latter being driven back produced unsanitary effects within the houses. On the whole our local Sewers sustained this unusual pressure satisfactorily, inasmuch that on the abatement of the storm, the pent-up sewerage quickly discharged itself, and with the exception of a fracture of a portion of the Pipe Sewer in Camberwell Grove, I have no special results to announce. So much for the low level sewerage, the disposal of which, I may remark, is dependent upon the storm outfalls, and pumping arrangements of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Mid Level Metropolitan Sewers. The Main Metropolitan Sewer which intercepts the mid portion of the upper drainage of the Parish, was in like manner overcharged, especially at Rye Lane, by Hanover Street, and at Albert Road, &c.; it can 80 readily be understood that the Rye Lane Sewer, which there required a free outlet for its discharge, on meeting with the impediment of a fully charged outlet, filled up very quickly and was the cause of much of the flooding complained of in that locality; a larger sewer would have met with no better result under such circumstances. This blocked outlet sewer at Albert Road also impeded the flow from Copeland Road and its vicinity, and at, and about Druid's Place by the “ Heaton's Arms ” where these sewers work in conjunction, they met with the same resistance and shared a like fate. High Level Effra Main Metropolitan Sewers. The High Level or Effra Main Metropolitan line of Sewer which crosses the Rye between East Dulwich Road and Nunhead Lane, was also heavily charged, and thus impeded the free emptying of the large sewer which comes across the Rye, running north and south up to the Stevens Estate at Sunnyside, &c. This latter Sewer receives the Sewerage from Forest Hill road and its surroundings, but all were blocked and overpowered through the intensity and quantity of the rainfall, and the interrupted discharge above referred to. The foregoing are some of the palpable causes, as I explained to you in Committee, of the complaints which you had to entertain , no remedy within the power of the Vestry exists to prevent such results on the recurrence of such an excessive downpour, the sizes of the local Sewers are, I think, proved to be sufficient, under the normal condition of the district, inasmuch that on the cessation of the storm on the 26th the flooding quickly subsided, and with the exception of the residuum of the drainage which 81 deposited itself in the unfortunately low basements, &c., all quickly disappeared, and our local Sewerage was in a few hours effectually discharging itself as usual. Without going into an exhaustive report on this matter, I may repeat my opinion as previously expressed to you, that any remedy for the amendment or prevention of these enumerated results, must be the subject of a very large and collective consideration. I may here state that in the few cases where floodings have been attributed to local causes, they shall have very early and earnest attention. J. C. REYNOLDS, July 13th, 1888. Surveyor. Report re Floodings, Monday, July 30th, 1888. Another unprecedented rainfall, equal to 3.17 ins., between the hours of 3 and 9 p.m., has been the cause of renewed and very severe floodings. In the lower portions of the Parish it has produced the usual inundation of Basements and Cellars, the inevitable result in low-lying districts, and which I venture to suggest should in the future be discouraged by the Vestry, and the existing ones advised to be abandoned where practicable. Also, in the upper portions of the Parish, this heavy rainfall caused damage to the Local Sewers, especially at Peckham Rye Common, through the overcharged condition of the Effra Main Metropolitan Line, which crosses from East Dulwich Road to Nunhead Lane. 82 The 4.0 ft. Barrel Local Sower, which runs southward, through the Rye Common, burst on the Common for a length of about 20 feet; this result, it need scarcely be said, was to be expected, as this Local Main Sewer met stubborn resistance at its outfall. This bursting enabled the pent-up Sewage to spread itself on the Common, passing into the Rye Pond, which overflowed, and thence passed down the steep Roads towards and along Rye Lane, Copeland Road, and adjacent Streets, doing much damage by flooding in its course. This Road and Street flooding, I am of opinion, was intensified through the recent removal of the Penstock, at the north end of the Peckham Rye Pond, the present very small outlet of the Pond prevented the storm water passing into the old course, viz., into the Brick Barrel Sewer, consequently the run of the flood was diverted on to the surface of the Roads. The bursting of the Sewer on the Common as before referred to, relieved to some extent the Sewer in Forest Hill Road, where (although the Basements were unfortunately again flooded near the foot of the Hill by Dunstan's Road) the Sewer was but slightly overstrained. At Lordship Lane also, this Main Metropolitan Sewer was so overpowered with the storm water, that a side entrance on the footpath at North Cross Road was lifted by its force, aided possibly by the confined air in the Sewer seeking an escape. As I remarked in my previous (printed) report of July 13th last, the "palpable cause " of these recurring floodings 83 is the overcharged condition of the main intercepting Sewers, it is but due, however, to note that the unexceptional avalanche-like downfall of rain within so short a period overpowered and overtaxed all the previous conceived necessities and appliances provided for ordinary wet seasons, and this subject must, I think, lead at no distant date to a serious consideration for the providing means to cope with such visitations in the future. These when undertaken must be of an extended character, and in the first instance (at least) must precede any Local extensions or enlargements of the present Sewers. I may again remark that our Local Sewers as a whole worked well, in proof of which scarcely had the storm abated, than our Roads and Streets (which an hour previously were under water), became passable, the Gully drainage acting efficiently, and the Sewers performing their duty as local conduits, leading to the greater conduits of the Main Sewers. So long as this telescopic delivery is maintained uninterrupted, we are tolerably safe, except under such visitations as the storm of the 30th ult., which, it appears (reasonably considered) it is scarcely possible to provide against. I have been in communication with the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works on this subject, and I know it is receiving his anxious consideration. In conclusion, although I admit it is but poor comfort, I may confidently report, that other districts have been similarly, if not more seriously, visited. J. C. REYNOLDS. Surveyor. August 1st, 1888, 84 With regard to the last paragraph of the Surveyor's Report, dated July 13th, 1888," where floodings have been attributed to local causes," your Surveyor reported upon the expediency of laying down two lengths of Intercepting Sewers at Pcckham Rye—one opposite Sternhall Lane, the other opposite Troy Town, for the purpose of relieving as much as possible the Rye Lane Sewer. This Report the Vestry adopted on the 19th December last, and the workwas immediately carried out. PUBLIC URINALS. 1. Addington square, next High 11.

MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Gentlemen, During the last few years, as the Registrar General shows, the birth-rate, the death-rate, and the marriage-rate have all been falling. This general tendency to fall was maintained in the year 1888. “The births registered in London in 1888 numbered 131,080, and were in the proportion of 307 to 1000 inhabitants. This is the lowest birth-rate recorded in London since 1841, when the rate was 30.4. In 1876 the rate was 35.9, but from that date it fell continuously year after year. “ The deaths registered in the year numbered 78,848, and corresponded to an annual rate of 18.5 per 1000. This is far the lowest death-rate as yet recorded in London; moreover, the three next lowest are those in the three immediately preceeding years, when the figures were successively 19.8,19.9, and 19.6. G 92 ' “ The marriages numbered 34,617, giving a proportion of 16.1 persons married to 1,000 of the population. This is the lowest marriage-rate as yet recorded in London. The next lowest rates, moreover, were those in the five immediately preceeding years, when they were successively 17.9, 17'6, 16.9, 16.6, and 16.3 per 1,000." There can be no doubt that this diminishing death-rate implies growing healthiness of the population, and that we may congratulate ourselves on the fact that the year 1888 was the healthiest year we have experienced since birthrates and death-rates have been systematically recorded. On the other hand, the diminishing birth-rate may possibly be regarded by some persons as an unsatisfactory feature in the returns. As a matter of fact, however, the diminish ing birth-rate renders the diminishing death-rate more significant of healthiness than would have been the case had the birth-rate been high. For, on the one hand, as children, in the first five years of life, always die in much larger proportion than do persons in any equal period of subsequent life, the births of any considerable number of children in excess of the actual number born in 1888 would have caused a more than proportionate increase in the deaths, and consequently a general increase in the deathrate ; and, on the other hand, it can readily be shown by calculation that the lower the birth-rate in relation to the death-rate the higher is the average duration of life among the population concerned. It need hardly be said that the death-rate implies healthiness or unhealthiness only in so far as it implies long or short average duration of life ; that, for example, there can be no difference in the healthiness of two localities, in one of which the death-rate is twice or even 93 thrice as high as that of the other, provided other conditions are such that in both cases the inhabitants attain the same mean age ; or that, conversely, supposing different populations to enjoy the same mean duration of life, any differences which may be presented by their respective death-rates are due to other circumstances than difference of health. Now, the association of a birth-rate of .307 per thousand with a death-rate of 18.5, implies (if these rates be continued) an average duration of life of 417 years; whereas if, the death-rate continuing the same, the birth-rate should be 35.9 (which was its rate in 1876) the implied duration of life would be 38.4, or 3.3 years less. On the whole, there was not much difference between the total zymotic death-rate of the year 1888 and that of 1887. There was an increase, of deaths due to hooping cough, from 2928 to 2987; of deaths due to diphtheria, from 961 to 1301; and of deaths due to enteric fever, from 672 to 720. But on the other hand deaths from measles fell from 2894 to 2401 ; and deaths from scarlet fever, from 1447 to 1209. There were 9 deaths from small pox in each year. The populations of London and its five groups of districts, as determined at the Census of 1881, are subjoined in Table I. :— Table I.—Populations of London and of its Groups of Districts at Census of 1881.

In Table II. will be found the numbers of births and deaths occuring in the whole of London and in each of its groups of districts, together with the corresponding birthrates and death-rates:— Table II.—Births, Deaths, Birth-rates and Death-rates of London and its Groups of Districts for 1888.

It is lower by 1.4 per 1,000 than it was in 1887. The death-rate of the Southern districts is also lower than those of the Central and Eastern districts ; but a little higher than those of the Western and Northern. It is lower also than that of all London. 95 Table III. records the deaths from the more important zymotic or infectious diseases in London, year by year, for the last ten years; and, for the year 1887,their distribution among the several groups of districts:— Table III.—Mortality of chief Zymotic Diseases in Loxdon for 10 Years.

Table IV. gives the populations of Camberwell and of its sub-districts as they were determined at the Census of 1881, and the populations estimated for the middle of the year 1888, on the assumption that the rates of increase of each sub-district and of the parish, which prevailed betwen 1871 and 1881, have been maintained since. Table IV.—Populations of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Parish. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham St. George's. As estimated at Census of of 1881 186,593 5,590 59,104 71,089 50,810 As estimated for middle of year 1888 271,480 7,067 93,788 103,849 68,211 It will be found that the total for the parish in the last line does not correspond exactly with the totals obtained by adding up the estimates for the several sub-districts. The difference, which is unimportant, depends on the fact (which renders absolute agreement impossible) that the increase for each sub-district, and also that for the entire parish, have been calculated on independent data. It is almost needless to say, that the assumed rates of increase are never really maintained; that the estimated annual growth of the parish is much more likely to prove fairly uniform than that of any of its constituent parts; and that hence, as we recede further and further from the last Census, the estimates of the parochial population, and especially the estimates of the populations of the several sub-districts, probably differ more and more widely from the populations actually existing. I have ventured, therefore, to make another estimate of the 97 population on the assumption that the death-rate of Camberwell, during 1888, was exactly equal to the death-rate determined by the Registrar General for the South of London. Now there is no particular reason to believe that Camberwell has been more healthy during the past year than the parishes in its immediate neighbourhood ; and if we assume, therefore, that the death-rate of 17.3, which is the Registrar General's estimate for the whole of South London, is also the death-rate of Camberwell, by an easy process we arrive at the conclusion that the population of Camberwell in the middle of 1888 was 232,890, a sufficently large population but less by 38,590 than the estimate based on former experience. On the whole, I believe that the smaller estimate, though obtained in an unorthodox way and doubtles incorrect, is much nearer the truth than the other is. During the year 1888, 7,132 children were born in the parish, of whom 3,594 were boys, 3,538 were girls (see Table V.); of these, 86 belonged to Dulwich, 2302 to Camberwell, 2530 to Peckham, and 2214 to St. George's. The total births were less numerous in 1888 than they were in 1887 by 317 ; and the diminution was general throughout the sub-districts. In Dulwich the falling off amounted to 21, in Camberwell to 61, in Peckham to 175, and in St. George's to 60. Table V.—Births in Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Parish. Dulwich. Camberwell.

It will be observed that those for 1888 are all smaller than those for 1887, in which year, also, the birth-rates were unusually low. They were all, also (excepting only that of Tarle VI.—Birth-rates of Camrerwell and its Sur-Districts. Parish. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. 1887 28.9 15.6 26.8 27.4 34.7 1888 25.9 12.2 24.5 24.2 32.5 St. George's), considerably lower than the birth-rate of the whole of London. These rates have naturally all been deduced from the higher estimates of the parochial population previously given. But of course the higher the estimate of the population, the actual number of births remaining the same, the lower will the birth-rate become. And the calculated birth-rates are generally so low, that I cannot doubt that they are incorrect; and that they supply an additional reason for regarding my larger estimate of the population as being far in excess of the truth. It may be pointed out, however, that, although doubtless the birth-rate of Dulwich is below its proper figure, the birth-rate of Dulwich, owing to the social characteristics of the place, is always far below that of any other part of the Parish. The deaths registered in Camberwell during the year (Table IX.) were 3,773, of which 1,848 were of males, 1925 of females; and of which 59 occured in Dulwich, 1425 in Camberwell, 1,282 in Peckham, and 1,007 in St. George's. 99 The deaths were less numerous than those of 1887 by 238 In Dulwich there was an increase of one; but in all the other districts there was a fall: in Camber well, of 147; in Peckham, of 34; and in St. George's, of 58. Of the 1,425 deaths returned for the sub-district of Camberwell, 345 occurred in the Workhouse and Infirmary, and 83 in two Lunatic Asylums, making a total of of 428 deaths, which, though included in the mortuary returns of this sub-district, no more belong properly to it than they do to the other sub-districts of the Parish. In order to determine the death-rates of the sub-districts, it is necessary to distribute these deaths proportionately among them. This has been done in Table VII.. the last column of which gives the corrected returns. O Table VII.—Re-distribution of Deaths among Sub-Districts of Camberwell. Deaths returned. Deaths in W. &L. A.

The following table gives these death-rates, and, for the sake of comparison, those of 1887:— Table VIII.—Death-rates of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Parish. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. 1887 15.6 9.6 14.3 15.1 15.6 1888 13.9 9.2 12.7 13.6 16.2 It will be observed, not only that the death-rates are all remarkably low (considerably lower than the lowest of the death-rates for the groups of Metropolitan Districts, which I have already quoted from the Registrar General's returns), but that, excepting that of St. George's, they are all considerably lower than the corresponding death-rates of 1887. I have explained, over and over again, that the extreme lowness of our death-rates is not wholly due to healthiness of population. As I have shown earlier in this Report, it may be taken for granted that I have largely over-estimated the amount of the population, not only for the Parish as a whole, but also for each of its subdistricts, excepting, perhaps, that of St. George's. Another source of fallacy is the fact that many deaths, due to the Parish, occur in institutions outside the Parish. For some few years past, these deaths have been supplied to us through the General Register Office, and I have been enabled, therefore, to correct the fallacy due to this cause. The supplemental deaths, here referred to, are set forth in Table X. They amounted to 256, of which 4 TABLE IX.—Returns of Births and Deaths for the Fifty-Two Weeks ending Saturday, December 27th, 1888. BIRTHS. DEATHS. ACCORDING TO AGE. ACCORDING TO DISEASES.

They raise the total mortality of the Parish from 3773 to 4029. Table XI. shows both the augmented mortality of the Parish and of its sub-districts, due to this addition, and the augmented death-rates:— Table XI.—Deaths and Death-rates of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts obtained by including the 256 Deaths which occured in Hospitals and elsewhere outside the Parish.

They also include an enumeration of deaths according both to ages and to diseases. There is not much in the tables calling for comment beyond the fact that both births and deaths were less numerous in 1888 than they were in the previous year; the births being lower by 397, the deaths by 214. This, of course, is in accordance with what was observed in regard to London generally, and with the general diminution in the birth- and death-rates. The deaths of children under five years of age were, as usual, very numerous. In the whole Parish they amounted to 1657, or 44 per cent. of the total mortality. The 102 tions varied, however, considerably in the different parts of the Parish. In Dulwich, where birth-rates and death-rates are always low, the number of such deaths was 13, and formed only 19 per cent. of the total deaths. In Camberwell, the number was 1259, and formed 36 per cent.; in Peckham, the number was 1535, and formed 40 per cent.; and in St. George's, the number was 1166, and formed 49 per cent. The deaths arranged under the head of accidental or other violence, including those of parishioners occuring in hospitals and elsewhere ouside the Parish, were 99. This number is larger by four than that returned in 1887. finder the heading of premature birth or defective vitality, are included 310 deaths, or 30 less than were recorded in the previous year. The group is a somewhat heterogeneous one, inasmuch as it includes, not only children born prematurely and dying on account of their prematurity, but many children that die of obscure and ill-defined causes during the first few weeks after birth. Thirty-seven deaths were ascribed to child-birth. This is three more than died from this cause in 1887, and was at the rate of 5.2 per 1,000 deaths. It may be observed that nearly all these deaths occurred in Camber well and Peckham; and that almost half occurred in the first quarter of the year. Inflammatory affections of the lungs caused 750 deaths, of which 352 occurred in children under five years of age. Of these, 301 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 146 in the second quarter, 76 in the third quarter, and 233 in 103 the fourth quarter. Deaths from these disorders amounted to 751 in the previous year. Diarrhœal affections destroyed 115 lives; 99 in children under five years of age, and 16 in persons above five. Of these deaths, 9 occurred in the first quarter, 20 in the second, 71 in the third, and 15 in the last. 239 deaths were ascribed to the same affections in 1887. The falling off in the number of diarrhoeal deaths was due to the coldness of the summer, and the consequent comparative absence of affections of the bowels at that season. The zymotic diseases were, on the whole, less fatal in 1888 than they were in the previous year. Hooping cough, which had caused 203 deaths in 1887, caused 160 only in 1888. The mortality due to this disease was heaviest in Peckham and St. George's. And it prevailed chiefly in the first and second quarters. Measles caused 101 deaths, having caused 133 in the previous year. This disease was chiefly fatal in Peckham and St. George's, especially in the latter; and it prevailed chiefly in the fourth quarter, during which time no less than 80 of the total number were registered. Scarlet fever was fatal in 105 cases, of which 76 died in the Parish, and 29 in hospital. There were six more deaths in this year than in the previous one. The disease prevailed in the first and fourth quarters, and was chiefly fatal in Peckham and St. George's. Thus, 17 deaths belonged to Camberwell, 40 to Peckham, and 48 to St. George's. Diphtheria, which caused a higher mortality in London than it has ever done before, caused 65 deaths in 104 well, or six less than it did in 1887. Of these, 49 occurred in the Parish, and the remainder in hospitals outside the Parish. Like scarlet fever, it was chiefly fatal in the first and last quarters. Three of the deaths belonged to Dulwich, 28 to Camber well, 15 to Peckham, and 17 to St. George's. The deaths from fever, mainly, of course, enteric fever, amounted to 31, of which 13 occurred in the first quarter. 16 of the total number belonged to Peckham. The number of deaths is smaller by 10 than that recorded in the previous year. One death from small-pox occurred in the first quarter of the year. In the year before there were none; in the year before that, two. Deaths from tubercular diseases amounted to 619. In 1887, 564 such deaths were recorded; in the previous year, 657. To sum up, I am justified in saying, that the mortality of the Parish has been unusually low during the year, that on the whole there has been no undue prevalence or fatality of zymotic diseases; and that the year has been remarkably healthy. The sanitary work of the Parish, during the year ending March 25th, 1889, has, on the whole, been going on satisfactorily; but unfortunately one of the Inspectors, Mr. McKay, who for several years past had suffered from bronchitis during the winter months, was for a time incapacitated, and had finally to give up his appointment, and another Inspector, who for some years had done good work, became incompetent, and had to be discharged. These unfortunate occurrences necessarily disarranged the work 105 of the office, and interfered to some extent with the continuous efficient performance of the ordinary duties of inspection. But the vacated places have been filled by other officers, and towards the close of the year ending March 25th, 1889, five Inspectors were, I am pleased to say, in full work. The total number of houses inspected for the first time was less than that inspected in the previous year; but the number of re-inspections was larger. The great bulk of the work performed was of the ordinary character, and needs no explanation or comment. I pointed out in my last report that for several years past the Inspectors had been giving more and more attention to what I termed "the niceties" of drainage; meaning thereby all those details which are necessary to ensure that drainage shall be not only efficient but also safe. This is a subject of the highest importance for the sanitary wellbeing of the Parish. The sewerage of London, so far at any rate as concerns the arrangement and construction of the main sewers bv Sir Joseph Bazalgette, under the direction of the late Metropolitan Board, and the arrangement and construction of the local sewers by the parochial Surveyors, under the direction of the Vestries and Local Boards, has, on the whole, as will generally be acknowledged, been admirably carried out. But in order to secure efficient and safe drainage it is essential, not only that the channels by which sewage is conveyed from dwelling-houses and other buildings and their adjuncts to the outlets of the main sewers should be as perfect as they can be made, but that also, on the one hand, all the details connected with the removal of sewage from premises should 106 be perfect, and on the other hand, that the arrangements for the disposal of sewage at the outlets should be adequate The last is a matter of great importance, and, as we all know, of great difficulty; and in fact the problem is one that still awaits solution. But it does not immediately concern us, and I do not propose to discuss it. The sanitary arrangements of houses, however, concerns us all very closely, and on this subject I deem it my duty to make some remarks. From the time when the present Vestry came into existence, great attention has been paid to this particular item of sanitary work. At first we had to get rid of the cess-pools and common privies with which, almost without exception, every house was provided, to have these replaced by water-closets, and to insist on the trapping and cleansing of drains, and on the drainage of yards and areas. But in these earlier times the best forms of closets, the best arrangements for flushing them and keeping them sweet, the best methods of dealing with the removal of slops, foul water, and rain water, the best forms of traps, and the best system of arranging underground drains, were not fully understood, and even if understood would have been difficult or impossible to enforce. But of late years scientific and practical knowledge with respect to these matters has made rapid advances, and public opinion has grown ; so that now not only are the correct principles and the practical details of house-drainage well understood, but also the public generally are alive to the need of having their housedrainage in perfect order. For several years past we have (as Table XIV. will show for last year) been enforcing the ventilation of soil-pipes, the disconnecting of sink, wastewater, and rain pipes from sewers, the provision of efficient 107 traps in place of such as are effete and useless, and of efficient water-closet pans and traps, and water-supply apparatus, in place of such as experience has shown to be defective or dangerous. But this has not been sufficient. It has long been known to the Sanitary Committee that, however well everything connected with the Parish drains has been carried out, there has never been any efficient supervision of the drainage and other sanitary arrangements of houses in course of construction. It has been no part of the duty of the Sanitary Inspectors to perform such functions; and there have been no officers on the Surveyor's staff to whom the duty has been, or could have been properly, entrusted. It is true that every builder has been required, before constructing his private drains, and connecting them with the public sewer, to send in a plan of his proposed drainage for the sanction of the Surveyor. But there has been no machinery by which builders could be compelled to carry out their private works in accordance with the plans submitted, or to ensure that the details of their works had been carried out in a workman-like or efficient manner. The Sanitary Committee, the Surveyor and myself have long been troubled about this matter; and all the more so, that the inspections of houses even recently built have shown that sanitary nuisances complained of have been largely due to scandalous neglect of duty on the part of those concerned in carrying out the drainage works; and that in most cases the plans sent in have not accorded with the arrangements finally adopted. The close attention and study which your Sanitary Inspectors have of late years had to devote to drainage questions, and the frequent reconstructions of drainage which, owins to the default above adverted to, H 108 they have had to superintend and carry to a successful issue, naturally pointed to them as being the best fitted of all members of the staff of the Vestry to be entrusted with the important duty, not only of superintending the reconstruction of the drainage in houses already built, yet suffering from defective drainage, but also of supervising and advising with respect to the sanitary arrangements of houses in course of construction. After fully considering the very great sanitary importance of the matter, and the feasability of the plan, the Surveyor and myself proposed to the Sanitary Committee that the above duty should be devolved on the Inspectors; and with their assistance we prepared a scheme and a series of requirements with respect to the drainage of new houses, embodying as far as possible all the more recent real improvements. After due deliberation our scheme was approved of by the Committee, and has since been adopted by the Vestry. It is impossible to tell at present how far this plan will prove a success; but undoubtedly it has the elements of success within it. The work is as yet only in its early infancy, and we cannot clearly foresee how large a staff' will be needed to carry it out effectually. The actual Sanitary Inspectors are now five in number, a number by no means too large to do all the ordinary duties required of them by Act of Parliament, apart from the special additional duties which henceforth they will have to discharge. The former duties cannot properly be neglected; the latter duties will probably demand a very large amount of time and thought; and if they grow, as doubtless they will, they will absorb so much of the Inspectors' time, that in some form or other 109 assistance will have to be provided or a further special department created. I hesitate at the present moment to suggest how the difficulty will have to be met. The difficulty, however, is certain to arise; but I think it better to wait, and to propose the remedy when the exact nature of the difficulty to be met becomes apparent. But the new work is so important and far reaching, and its importance will gradually become so manifest, that I feel sure that in the course of time the Vestry will provide an adequate staff for its efficient performance. I may add here that, necessary and important as the supervision and arrangement of the drainage works of new houses certainly are, the gradual reconstruction of the drainage of houses already built is at least as necessary and important, and is even more difficult. For the Sanitary Authority have no power to compel the examination of underground drains unless they give evidence of being out of order by creating a nuisance; and generally where such a nuisance exists, and the drains are examined, they prove to be altogether faulty, so that not only has new drainage probably on a new system to be carried out, but the defective drainage has to be wholly, or to a large extent, abolished and removed. I append to this report (see Appendix) the regulations which are now furnished to builders, and which will henceforth guide us both in carrying out the drainage of new houses, and in reconstructing when necessary the drainage of houses already built. The principles which have guided us in the framing of our regulations are mainly as follows:—1st, that there shall be a ready and efficient discharge of soil, slops and waste water into the public 110 sewers; 2nd, that every precaution shall be taken to prevent the entry of sewer gas into houses; and 3rd, that all the drainage works shall be good and lasting, and so placed as to be easy to inspect and keep in good order. I need not go into the details of the regulations, the importance and significance of each of which will be obvious to all who study them. Another matter on which I wish to make a few remarks is the question of the application of the powers conferred by the Artisans' Dwelling Acts to unhealthy areas in the Parish. It will be recollected that soon after the creation of the London County Council, a communication was addressed by this body to all the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards requesting that the Medical Officers and Surveyors should be directed to report to the County Council all such areas within their respective districts as seemed to them proper for demolition and replacement by model lodginghouses ; and it will probably be recollected that I reported briefly that I was not prepared to make any such return. Now it is well known that in various parts of Camberwell there is much small property which is old, ill-built, dirty, inhabited by persons of not over cleanly habits or occupations, and needing constant supervision to keep it in anything like a reasonable sanitary condition; which for various reasons we might well like to get rid of; and which I am sure many well-meaning persons would at once condemn. But of the property here referred to, the larger groups occupy sites not well adapted for dealing with on a large scale and as a whole, and the smaller groups can be dealt with if the need should arise, by the Vestry itself, under Torrens's Act, or the Nuisance Removal Acts. There are, moreover, other reasons of a more important kind why I have 111 hesitated to condemn such property. The houses are mostly small, three or four-roomed dwellings, which are largely occupied by single families, or at most a couple of families. They have yards or small gardens, which are of great service to the inhabitants in conducting small businesses or trades, and in fact on such grounds are largely occupied by costermongers and persons of that class; and further, notwithstanding their unsavoury appearance and apparent over-population, we have found that preventible diseases prevail no more in them than in poor houses of a better class, and considerably less than they do in neighbouring tenement houses. The reasons, indeed, which have deterred me from condemning them are:—1st, that they are not the special haunts of unhealthiness; 2nd, that though they tend to be dirty and untidy, and to fall into disrepair, they are from their size and their surroundings better suited for the kind of tenants occupying them than tenement houses would be ; and 3rd, that their ventilation and sanitary arrangements are really better than at first sight one might suppose. I have, over and over again, asked those dwelling in them whether they would rather live in them or remove to tenement or model lodging-houses; and almost without exception the reply made to me has been to the effect, that they prefer their own houses, because they have them to themselves, they have the use of a garden or yard, and the rant is less than would be that for equivalent accommodation in any form of tenement house. I may add, that I have several times made enquiry of clergymen and medical men, whose duties take them largely into these localities, and have found them taking very nearly the same view of the case that I have done. I am free to confess that the demolition of all such property as that to which I refer would remove a load of anxiety and responsibility from my shoulders. 112 In May, 1888, a sudden small outbreak of Scarlet Fever was brought to my knowledge. It appeared that between the 6th and 9th of the month, at a time when Scarlet Fever was not prevailing in the Parish, it broke out in nine scattered houses, all of which, as it turned out, were supplied by one milkman. But in the large majority of the houses supplied by the same milkman there was no occurrence of the disease. On investigation there was found to O be no Scarlet Fever, nor had their been any, in the milkman's family or among his servants, and his cows, with one exception, were healthy. The one cow presented sores and scabs on one of its teats, which had a resemblance to those observed two or three years ago on some cows at a dairy at Hendon, which Dr. Klein regarded as the evidence of an ' attack of bovine Scarlet Fever, and to which he attributed an outbreak of Scarlet Fever, which had occurred among the customers of the cow-keeper to whom these cows belonged. Dr. Klein was invited to examine this cow; and I have heard that he has come to the conclusion that the disease was identical with that met with in the Hendon cows. It is right, however, to add that Dr. Klein's views are not accepted by all competent observers. Further, the disease in the present instances did not spread to other cows. Subsequently I ascertained that one of the milkman's servants was a lodger at a house in the neighbourhood, whence, on the 25th April immediately preceding, a case of Scarlet Fever had been removed to Hospital, and in which disinfection of the room occupied by the patient had been carried out under the supervision of one of the Inspectors on the 26th. It turned out that the house was occupied by a man and his wife, and that the patient and the servant of the milkman were their lodgers occupying separate rooms; and further, that the husband and the 113 patient were both servants to another milkman living in the neighbourhood, in the distribution of whose milk no outbreak of Scarlet Fever whatever had occurred. The suspected milkman's own servant, though living in the same house with the patient, never saw him during any part of his illness, and moreover seemed apparently entirely free from disease. The case is not a clear one, and I did not think it right, therefore, to do more than lay the facts before the Sanitary Committee at the time; and as nothing further was elicited to explain the outbreak, and no other cases of Scarlet Fever followed, I thought it best not to give the matter publicity. I am inclined however to believe, that the poison of the disease was really conveyed by one day's distribution of milk; and that in some way or other the servant who had lodged in the same house as the scarlatinal patient was the immediate source of contagion. The only other subject to which I desire to call attention, is the seizure, on the 1st February, by Inspectors Stevenson and Dewey, of a large quantity of horse flesh intended for sale as human food. The Inspectors' attention had been drawn to suspicious proceedings on premises at the rear of No. 1, Linnell Road. In order to ascertain the facts they spent part of the night in a neighbouring room overlooking the place, and so found that horse flesh in large abundance was being prepared for human food. In the course of the night a portion of this was taken away in a cart, which the Inspectors followed to a butcher's shop in the London Road, and to several other shops in Southwark and Newington. In the morning the Inspectors entered the premises, and seized one ton fifteen hundredweight of horse flesh, which was unfit for food, and was afterwards condemned at the Lambeth Police Court by Mr. Partridge. 114 A summons was then issued against the defendant, who was fined £20 and £20 costs, and, in default, was committed to prison for two months, with hard labour. I think great credit is due to Inspectors Stevenson and Dewey for the skill and zeal they displayed in this matter. In concluding this report I should like to express my great regret at the enforced retirement, on account of illhealth, of Inspector McKay, who, for a period of 16 years, faithfully served the Vestry as one of the Inspectors of Nuisances, and whose high character and honesty of work I have always fully appreciated; and I should wish also to record my satisfaction with the excellent work which has been carried out during the year by your present staff of Inspectors. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. S. BRISTOWE. 115 TABLE XII. ANNUAL MORTALITY RETURN OF ZYMOTIC DISEASES FROM 1856 (inclusive), YEAR. Hooping Cough. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria.

RULES RESPECTING DRAINAGE AND OTHER SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS TO BE OBSERVED BY BUILDERS. 1.—All drains and soil pipes shall, as far as possible, be kept outside the houses. 2.—The underground drains shall be made of sound glazed stoneware pipes, with well-fitting joints made watertight with Portland cement or other approved material. The main drains shall not be less than G-in. in diameter. 3.—They shall be laid evenly with a regular gradient from the sewer upon a bed of concrete or other suitable solid foundation. 4.—They shall have no sharp curves; and especially any portion that may be situated under the house shall be laid, where practicable, in a direct line and without junctions. 5.—The main drain shall, where desirable, be disconnected from the sewer by an approved Interceptor. 6.—The drains shall, where practicable, be ventilated by a fresh-air inlet placed in the main drain as near as possible 120 to the Interceptor, and by outlet shafts of not less than 3-in. in diameter, prolonged directly upwards from the soil pipes outside the house, to the highest point of the roof, of at least three feet above the top of the highest windows. 7.—An inspection-chamber shall, where practicable, be provided between the Interceptor and the fresh-air inlet. 8.—Rain-water pipes, sink-pipes, and waste-water pipes of all kinds shall discharge outside the house into a stoneware syphon gully communicating directly with the underground drain. 9.—All sink pipes, as also soil pipes, shall, as far as practicable, have no sharp curves. 10.—Proper Y junctions shall, in all cases, be made in connection with all underground drains.

That in respect of existing properties, before notices with regard to inspection-chambers or damp courses are served, the consent of the Committee is first to be obtained after the facts of each case have been reported upon by the Sanitary Officers. It is Recommended— That pan-closets with containers and also of the long hopper class be not adopted. That for surface-traps stoneware syphon gullies only be used. 123 1888-89. ANALYST'S REPORTS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital, Medical and Surgical College, S.E. June 24th, 1888. To the Vestry of St Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, During the past quarter I have analysed twenty-five samples of Milk, six of which were adulterated with respectively, 20,15,7, 8,8 and 5 per cent, of added water. One other milk was skimmed to the extent of at least 30 per cent. but, whether of ignorance, or intention, I cannot say. It is a very common occurrence for a vendor of a watered milk to attempt to save himself by selling a top-skim rich in cream, a plan which does not answer. But a favouring of a i 124 customer with his neighbour's cream is not uncommon, and in this manner the skimming may be explained. Nine Butters have been examined. One was Butterine. About another Butter I was much exercised as to whether I should give a Certificate of Adulteration. Of late, butters have very much altered in the proportion of their constituent parts. From my own knowledge of genuine butters obtained by favour of various people, I have never found a butter to yield a larger per centage than 88.2 per cent. of fatty acids insoluble in water; the rule is about 875 per cent. of the total butter-fat. But of late, owing to the manipulation of butters upon a large-scale in manufactories, the proportion has in a few cases risen to 89 per cent., and in the case which is now sub judice to 89.5 per cent. of the whole butter-fat. In this particular instance every item in the butter was, to say the least, extraordinary. The melting point as high as 35. The sp. gr, 0.9116, when the lowest gravity I have ever known was 0912. The butter almost tasteless and very uneven in polorization. As everything, as in milks, depends upon the standard taken, I wished to refer the samples unofficially to Somerset House, but your Committee thought otherwise, and I therefore altered my Certificate. Whatever the opinion of Somerset House Officials may be, one thing is certain, the sample examined by Mr. Otto Hehner was quite different from the sample analysed by me. It contained a notable quantity of copper, whereas the sample left with me contained no trace of copper. Eight samples oi Gin and Whisky were fairly up to 125 standard. The same may be said of Four Mustards, Two Peppers, One Coffee and One Cocoa. The Certificates are all in possession of your Inspectors. Michaelmas, 1888. During the past quarter I have analysed twenty-four samples of Milk, and these have been on the whole satisfactory. The Summer months are expected to yield fodder which produces milks rich in cream. Some brought by our Inspectors must have been top-skims, so rich are they in cream. Only one milk out of the twenty-four was found to be skimmed, and none watered beyond the obligation to be allowed. Of six Butters all were accounted genuine, as we have been obliged to raise our standard. Five of the samples of Coffee out of the six forwarded were genuine. One sample contained more than a trace of chicory extract, with very slight indication of chicory-root. Silica was almost absent. But there was more extractive than I can account for, and I am making a further more complete study of the article. Samples of Lard and Cocoa were also genuine. Of two Mustards one was strongly suspected from outward 126 ance, but its very suspiciousness was due to unusual excellence, and from the presence of so much black mustard. Two Peppers were proved to be unmixed. Four Gins and four Whiskies complete my list. They were of good quality and up to standard. All the certificates are in the hands of the Inspectors with the exception of that of No. 59. December 25th, 1888. During the past quarter I have analysed seventeen Milks. Of these, five were adulterated with respectively 18, 16, 21, 12 and 11 per cent. of added water. No. 132 was similar to 131, only skimmed. Nearly 30 per cent. of adulterations is the largest number we have had for a length of time, and shows the necessity of following up the subject. The six samples of Tea were of interest as exhibiting the purity of the article. With the exception of a few extraneous leaves, none but the genuine tea could be found. Of course, there was considerable variety in the quality. No. 143 was very good: all yielded good extractive. The mechanical analysis of tea can be undertaken by any purchaser: the amount of dust of tea should regulate the time for drawing, as the larger the amount the less required 127 and the shorter the time for extraction. The best tea can be spoilt by allowing the tea-leaves to remain in contact with the aqueous extract after the goodness has been exhausted. The so-called increase in strength, by long standing, is in the tannin, and the consequent indigestibility of the " tea." One Butter has been examined. Taking a low standard it has 40 per cent. of fat other than butter-fat. Four Lards were of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. The five samples of Pickle were quite free from any impurity, and were all made with vinegar free from sulphuric acid. Nos. 137 and 138 were very soft, but otherwise were quite passable. Two preserved or Bottled Fruits have been examined. The preserved black currants were remarkably good and clean, although somewhat bleached, probably by sunshine or by the want of it. A sample of Raspberry Jam was free from impurity and perfectly clean. Three Porters may be mentioned as having been analysed. One of them was very inferior, and as watery as any one could wish. In alcoholic contents even, it was only a little superior to a temperance drink which I have lately examined. 128 Lastly, I have to record the examination of two Citrates of Magnesia, and of three Rhubarbs. The term citrate of magnesia is known to be a misnomer, and so I have passed it as of the nature demanded. If it were already citrate of magnesia there would be no effervescence on the addition of water, and no use in the preparation. As far as the two samples are concerned, one is much better than the other. The Rhubarbs were of very good quality. March, 1889. During the past quarter, twenty-one Milks have been analysed. None of them have been grossly adulterated with water, but many have been tampered with. Four of them have only just passed, and other four of them have been adulterated with, respectively, 8, 8, 7, and 9 per cent. of added water. Another sample had six per cent. of added water and was skimmed. Besides milks sold as such, one milk sold as Skim-milk had at least 22 per cent. of added water. I say at least 22 per cent., taking the low standard of Somerset House. The milk numbered 154 was referred to Somerset House, and the case was heard yesterday (April, 4th). The analyses in juxta-position are interesting. 129 ] Somerset House after 15 days. Bernays', Fresh. Total solids 11.25 11.76 Water 68.75 88.24 Fat 3.67 3.69 Solids not Fat 7.58 8.07 100.00 100.00 The verdict of Somerset House was: "at least 7 per cent. of added water." I had given 7 per cent. It will be observed by those who understand figures that the large increase in the quantity of water and consequent decrease in the solids, not fat in the Somerset House analysis is owing to the degradation of the milk through keeping. The only value of the analysis of a stale milk consists in the confirmation (or otherwise) of the fat, and even this may alter if the water of adulteration should be of very bad quality. There should also be a confirmation of the correctness of the original analysis shewn in the decrease of the total solids. The three Condensed Milks, Nos. 181, 185, and 193, are of a character so inferior that the public ought to be warned against them. When they are compared with Nestles (the best of all) and the Anglo-Swiss, they are only worthy of the name of Sugared Skim-milks; and when they are made up with water, as directed upon the labels, they should be called Sugared diluted Skims. They are an injury to the milk-trade, and a cover for the sale of 130 Watered Skims. Whether they are permissible under the Adulteration Act, is a matter for lawyers. Sugar is cheap. No. 185 contains 51 per cent. Certainly a profit is not without honour. This sample states honestly (if the label is read by poor people) that the tin contains skimmed milk with the finest cane sugar. This very sample, if made up with water according to label, is skimmed milk (and it must be skimmed by machinery) containing thirty-eight per cent. of added water. To most people, who eat more than is good for them, it matters but little whether the nutritious quality of the milk be more or less, although one wonders that they do not expect to find their tea or coffee whitened by the cream of the milk. But what about the children? Condensed Milk No. 181 which exhibits a standard, contains only 44 per cent. of sugar, and when made up with water, according to label, is really sweetened Skim with twenty per cent.of added water. Condensed Milk No. 193 is prepared abroad, I should have thought might have been kept there with advantage, although probably the residents are too knowing to use it. It has a very sickly greenish tint, and is thickened by 44 per cent. of sugar. "It is prepared from the richest cows' milk, from which only a portion of the original cream has been extracted before condensation." "It is cheaper and more convenient than ordinary milk." I quote the label, and do not doubt its greater cheapness to the Vendor. There are no directions about the making up as Milk for the community, but only for Puddings and Pastry, and for 131 less Infants. I would call attention to the recipe for Infants. "Mix 10 to 15 parts of Water, according to the age of the child." Let me give you the compositions of various milks by way of comparison. Mother's Milk. 193 with 10 parts of water 193 with 15 parts of water Water 88.6 92.96 95.17 Fat 3.5 0.04 0.03 Casein 2.7 to 3.5 1.42 0.97 Sugar of Milk 5.0 1.35 0.93 Ash 0.2 0.24 0.16 Sucrose — 3.99 2.74 100.00 100.00 100.00 If the unfortunate Infant is dependent upon the added ten parts of water, it is bad; but if upon the fifteen parts of water, it is worse. The child must then drink three times the normal to obtain the necessary nitrogenous food, and about one hundred times to obtain the necessary fat. May I suggest that skimmed milk is much cheaper and better, when sweetened with sugar, than such condensed milks. Of Sweetstuffs for children, five varieties have been analysed. No. 165 was sufficiently dirty from exposure: if that could be got over, it was unobjectionable. The others were clean, and do not call for remark. 132 Three Porters and one Ale were fairly of the nature, substance and quality demanded. Of four Whiskies only one was below standard. A sample of Rum was of usual quality. One sample of Butter had all the marks of a genuine article before it is brought down to standard. Of further articles of food I have examined four cases of Tinned Lobster, and one tin of Salmon. The latter was very good and the Salmon contained but a trace of tin. The only distinctly poor sample was No. 192. The case was very much battered, and two solder holes in the top of the tin more than suspicious. The inside of the tin was much blackened and corroded: the ash from nearly 400 grains contained iron, tin, lead and copper. No. 188 was the best. Two kinds of Beef Tea, two samples of each, require some notice. Both contain a considerable amount of gelatine, from which comes a very large proportion of the boasted nitrogen. The gelatine in No. 145 so nearly approached the characteristics of ordinary glue, that I was pleased to find that No. 171 of the same name was perfectly free from the taint. From a scientific point of view I should give the preference to 153 and 163. In conclusion I have to apologise for the lateness of my report. Many of the articles were only brought on and after Quarter Day. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. 133 VESTRY CLERK'S REPORT, Your Vestry Clerk begs to submit the following Report upon some of the chief questions which have been under the consideration of the Vestry during the past year:— meetings. During the year the following Meetings of the Vestry, and its Committees have taken place:— Vestry Meetings 45 Standing Commitee Meetings 142 Special and Sub-Committee, Burial Board, Baths, and Libraries Commissioners Meetings 168 ' Parish Officers' Meetings 67 Total 422 annual accounts. The Accounts of the Vestry for the year ending the 25th March, 1889, will be found at pages 193 to 276 of this Report. They have been examined by the Auditors elected by the Vestry under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts. The following Bills in Parliament have been brought under the notice of the Vestry or the Law and Parliamentary Committee:— 134 Parliamentary and Municipal Elector's Registration Bill. This Bill, introduced by Mr. Causton, amends the law with respect to the Registration of Voters in the Metropolis successive occupation of either Lodgings or Houses or from different qualifying premises in any part of the Metropolis, to qualify for vote; the separate Lodger List to be abolished and new forms for claim provided. It has now been dropped. Occupiers' Disqualification Removal Bill. This is another Bill dealing with the Registra- n ~ tion Laws, and proposes to enact that soldiers, and others absent on service shall not be disqualified tor not having been in continuous occupation. It has been reintroduced from last Session. Housing of the Working Classes. Is a Bill, re-introduced by Lord Henry Bruce, to further amend the Law relating to the Dwellings of the Working Classes and the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Acts, 1875 to 1885, it increases the penalties on owners of dwellings for disobedience of an order requiring abatement of nuisance, makes it an obligation of every Vestry and District Board to make Bye-laws respecting lodging houses, and gives power of inspection of cellar dwellings. The Local Government are authorised upon a written representation of at least six ratepayers in a district, to hold an enquiry us to whether the local authority have tailed to do their duty under Section Seven of the Housing of the Working Classes' Act, 1885, and if such representation is well founded, the Board shall issue an order dissolving the local authority in default, and directing a fresh election of Members. Housing of the Working Classes (Metropolis). This is also a Bill on the same subject brought in by Mr. James Stuart, empowering the County 135 Council, subject to the provisions of this Bill:—(1) To buy, sell, hold, let, or hire land. (2) To build, manage buildings, and let rooms. (3) To lay out land for any of the following purposes:—(I.) To provide suitable dwellings inside or outside of the Metropolitan area for use by the population engaged in the industry of such area. (H.) To provide lodgings, baths, wash-houses, halls, or other structures required in their judgment for the use and convenience, or health of such population as aforesaid. (III.) To provide open spaces required in their judgment for the use, convenience of health of such population as aforesaid. (IV.) To acquire for the County Council any land within the said area or within five miles thereof, which, in their judgment, ought to be acquired with a view to the expansion of the said population. (V.) To provide, in connection with any dwellings held by the County Council, or for the use of the inhabitants thereof, kitchens, nurseries, dining halls, or other rooms for joint use. The object of this Bill, which was introduced for the first time in 1888, is to enable the London County Council to acquire land, build and let houses and rooms at fair rentals, provide open spaces, baths, halls, &c., for the benefit of the poorer classes. Vacant land is to be rated. The County Council are authorised to borrow money for the purposes of the Act. The method of providing for interest on, and repayment of, such advances, as well as other outlays, is by adding not more than one penny in the pound to the income tax paid on rents received by the receivers of rent within the metropolitan area. A cheap method of compulsory purchase is provided. Parliamentary Elections (Meetings in Schools). Proposes that all schools receiving grants out of moneys provided by Parliament shall be lent for the use of Parliamentary Members, or Candidates. 136 The Rating of Hoardings. This Bill is re-introduced by Mr. BurdettCoutts and is designed to meet the difficulty raised by the decision of the Courts of Justice, that a person is not liable to rates for his advertising stations or hoardings placed on a portion of premises which are being rebuilt, inasmuch as the judges were unable to regard the nature of the interest as an occupation, but only as a temporary holding for advertising. This Bill provides that the owner of any land used, whether temporarily or permanently, for the exhibition of advertisements, or for the erection of a hoarding or structure to be used, or capable of being used for this purpose, but not otherwise occupied, is to be rateable on the value derived or derivable from its use. So also where land occupied for other purposes is used, whether temporarily or permanently, for the exhibition of advertisements, &c., the rateable value is to be so estimated as to include the increased value derived or derivable from this use. Another provision of the Bill is that, where a Corporation, Board, Vestry, Sanitary Authority, &c., grants, under a statutory power, a license for the temporary erection of a hoarding or other structure upon any public highway, or upon any of its property, it may include in this license a condition prohibiting the affixing of any advertisement, or sanctioning it upon some payment. In case this condition is not complied with the penalty may be £5, and 40s. tor every day during the continuance of the offence. Any penalty so recovered is directed to be applied in aid of the rate levied by the authority for the repair of the highway. This Bill has now become passed. School Board for London Elections. This Bill was introduced by the Member for the Dulwich Division, and provides for the abolition of the existing divisions for election of Members of the 137 London School Board and adopts the parliamentary divisions for that purpose, each division to be entitled to return one member, except that the City of London shall be entitled to return two members. [Dropped.] Hours of Polling (Extension). This Bill provides that at all Parliamentary and Municipal Elections the poll shall commence at eight o'clock a.m., and be kept open until nine o'clock p.m. [Dropped.] Coal and Wine Duties. A Bill for the continnance of these duties for a limited period has been introduced by Sir Robert Fowler on behalf of the Corporation of London, and another Bill by Sir Joseph Pease for the abolition of the duties. Many communications for and against the abolition have been received, but the Vestry adhered to their resolution to take no action in the matter. This matter was reported upon fully in the last Report. The Bill for the Abolition has now received the royal assent. Metropolis Rating Amendment. The object of this Bill is to charge, as in the case of a sewers rate, upon the freehold or inheritance of the land within the metropolis, the capital sums now due or hereafter to become due in respect of loans raised or hereafter to be raised, with the previous sanction of the Treasury or of the Local Government Board, after full investigation as to the class and nature of the work, and exclusively applied to carrying out permanent improvements. The Select Committee on Metropolitan Local Government (1866) reported, "that nearly the whole of its (the late 138 " Metropolitan Board of Works) expenditure and obligations " have been incurred for the purpose of supplying wants " arising from the defects of former administration of the " affairs of the metropolis, and of effecting permanent " improvements which have tended to increase the value " of property in the metropolis." They conclude, "Your " Committee therefore recommend that in any arrangement " of the fundamental resources of the Metropolitan Board, a " portion of the charge for permanent improvements and " works shall be borne by the owners of property within the " metropolis, the rate being in the first instance paid by the " occupier and subsequently deducted from his rent, as is now " provided in regard to the general property tax." The machinery by which it is proposed to give effect to this principle of local taxation is to take out of the amounts raised by any rating authority in the metropolis such sum now included therein as represents borrowed capital or annual instalments for its repayment, and to substitute in lieu thereof a metropolitan improvement rate, to be collected as a fixed charge from the occupier, as in the case of land tax. The occupier paying the same shall be entitled to deduct the amount from any rent payable by him to his superior in title, and each successive owner of any interest less than the fee simple shall have this power. All contracts whereby this rate is shifted upon the occupier or the owner of any intermediate interest are declared void. Metropolis Water. This Bill recites that it is expedient for Sanitary and other reasons that the power of cutting off water, supplied by Water Companies for domestic purposes, should be restricted, and provides that the order of a Magistrate 139 shall be requisite to authorise the cutting off of water supplied for domestic purposes. [Withdrawn.] Parliamentary Franchise. (Women). Two Bills giving the right to women to vote in all Parliamentary Elections have been introduced, one by Mr. Woodall, and the other by Mr. Walter McLaren. [Withdrawn.] Poor Rate (Metropolis). This Bill is based upon the proposition that the relief of the poor of the metropolis is a common interest of all the ratepayers of the metropolis, and that consequently the cost of such relief should be defrayed by a rate levied equally over the entire metropolitan area. The principle was recognised in 1867 by the establishment of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, the operation of which has from time to time been extended, until it now covers about 43 per cent. of the cost of poor relief. The inadequacy of this provision is exhibited by the latest return, which shows that the poor rate in Holborn is three shillings in the pound, whilst in Westminster it is only one shilling and seven pence, and the return shows that the poorest districts are the most heavily rated. It is proposed by this Bill to charge the whole cost of poor relief in the metropolis upon the Common Fund (Clause 4). The Bill avoids centralisation by interfering as little as possible with the several boards of guardians (Clause 11). But, on the other hand, as the guardians will be empowered to draw upon a common fund provided by K 140 the whole metropolis, it is proposed that they should be subjected, in some degree, to the control of a central authority representative of the entire body of metropolitan ratepayers. The London County Council is accordingly invested by this Bill with certain powers of control over the guardians (Clauses 9, 10, 13, and 15), and is also made the successor of the Metropolitan Asylums Board (Clauses 16 and 17). Touch will be maintained between the County Council and the guardians by a provision that the representatives on the Council of the area covered by each union shall be ex officio members of the board of guardians for that union. There will be no other ex officio members and no nominated members (Clause l8). In the case of indoor relief, it is proposed to extend the machinery already provided in connection with the Common Fund to strictly analogous expenditure. At present the entire cost of the maintenance of children in schools, and of casuals in casual wards, is charged upon the Common Fund, although the administration remains with the several boards of guardians, and the Bill applies the same principle to the maintenance of the inmates of workhouses, infirmaries, and other poor law institutions. The County Council is empowered by the Bill (Clause 12) to transfer indoor paupers from one union to another in the metropolis, and thus obviate a waste of accommodation, which prevails to a considerable extent under the present system. 141 In the case of outdoor relief, the Select Committee on Poor Law Relief last session reported that "there are wide "divergencies in the system of administration of out-door "relief pursued by the various metropolitan boards of "guardians, and, admitting that the guardians should within "certain limits be able to adapt their policy to the particular "circumstances of each district, it cannot be regarded as "satisfactory that there should be in adjoining districts such "a marked difference in practice as now sometimes exists." It is intended that by this Bill uniformity should be secured where uniformity is desirable, whilst at the same time the provisions are sufficiently elastic to adjust themselves to the varying circumstances of different unions (Clause 14). An Amendment to this Bill, "to put off for six months," which was carried in the House of Commons, was moved by the Member of the Peckham Division and seconded by the Member for Dulwich, at a subsequent Meeting of the Vestry the following resolution was carried. "That this Vestry considering that the principle con"tained in 'The Poor Rate (Metropolis) Bill is worthy of "their strongest support, trusts that the measure may be "re-introduced into Parliament, and receive the sanction of the Legislature at an early date, and that a copy of this "resolution be forwarded to the Members of Parliament for "the Borough." Sanitary Regulation of Buildings. This Bill provides that all buildings throughout the United Kingdom shall be registered and a certificate obtained from a licentiate in sanitary practice, stating that the sanitary condition of such building is 142 satisfactory, whereupon the Sanitary Registrar appointed by the local authority may issue his certificate stating that the building, being registered in accordance with the provisions of the Sanitary Registration of Buildings Act 1889, may be occupied accordingly. [Dropped.] School Board Pensions. To allow the School Board for London to grant superannuation allowances to their Officers who become disabled by infirmity or age to discharge the duties of their office; under the provisions of 29 Vict. cap. 31, but no officer to be entitled to an allowance unless he consents to a deduction from his salary at the rate of two per cent. per annum for the purpose of forming a Superannuation Fund. Shops (Weekly Half-holiday. Introduced bv Sir John Lubbock, and recites that whereas the health of many persons employed in shops is seriously injured by reason of the length of the period of employment therein, it is expedient to provide for the limitation of such period, and provides that the local authority, upon a requisition signed by not loss than two-thirds of the occupiers of shops within the District belonging to the class to which the application relates, shall make an order giving effect to the said application. [This Bill has since been dropped.] Superannuations—(Officers of County Councils). To enable County Councils to grant superannuation or retiring allowances to all officers and servants who become disabled or disqualified by age or infirmity, or any other causes, from properly discharging the duties of their offices; and also a deduction of two and a half per cent.from salaries to meet superannuation allowances. 143 Parliamentary Elections Bill. The present Bill to consolidate, simplify, and amend the law relating to parliamentary elections is the first attempt yet made to embody in one measure the various complicated statutory provisions in numerous Acts of Parliament on this subject. In by far the larger portion of this Bill the existing law is simply reproduced with such verbal alterations and modifications as were needed to fit in the various provisions with the proposed amendments of and alterations in the law proposed by this Bill. Wherever possible the exact words of existing statutes are retained, with the view of reducing the debatable matter, as far as practicable, to a minimum. For the most part the law as it now exists is simply reproduced in the words of the several statutes particularly as regards:— (1.) The provisions relating to illegal and corrupt practices. (2.) The provisions relating to procedure at elections. (3.) The law relating to election petitions. (4.) The provisions relating to issue of writs, with modifications, and fixing date of elections. (5.) The method of taking votes at elections. The chief alterations in the law proposed by this Bill are:— (1.) The substitution of simple residential manhood 144 suffrage as the qualification for the election of members to serve in Parliament in lieu of all existing; franchises. (2.) The abolition of dual voting at elections. (3.) Simplification of the registration laws to accord with the proposed new franchise, mostly based on the provisions of the Scotch law. (4.) Alterations in the law as to the appointment and duties of returning offieers in view of the new proposals contained in the Bill. (5.) The diminution of election expenses to candidates, and the payment of certain charges out of the Consolidated Fund. (6.) At general elections all elections to be on one and the same day throughout the United Kingdom. (7.) The abolition of the registration courts for the revision of lists of voters. (8.) The repeal of the Septennial Act, and substitution of triennial parliaments. (9.) The closing of public and licensed houses on the day of election. County Council Election. The first election under the Local Government Act, 1888, was held throughout the Metropolis on January 17th, 1889, and a contest took place in all the divisions of the Borough of Camberwell, the Vestry Hall was used for the counting of the votes, and the result declared from the balcony over the entrance, by Mr. G. W. 145 Marsden, Jnr., the Deputy Returning Officer. The members elected will be found on page (301). Coroners Court. The Mortuary Committee have for a long time had under their consideration the necessity of erecting a Coroner's Court, and have been endeavouring to select a site for this purpose, but no eligible spot could be found, excepting at the Mortuary. The Coroner having written to the Vestry again on this matter, I addressed a letter to the Bishop of Rochester asking his permision to erect a Coroner's Court on the ground next the Mortuary and for his consent to the holding of inquests therein. His Lordship, in reply, expressed his regret at being unable to comply with the request of the Vestry, the Canon preventing the holding of secular courts on Consecrated ground, and a recent Act forbidding the erection of any building on a disused church yard. Kingswood Road. In 1871, the late Mr. Marshall applied for permission to form this road in continuation of a portion then called Church Road, leadingout of Penge Road (now College Road) into Victoria Road (now Dulwich Wood Park). The road was then formed by him, but he never repaired the same, Complaints have, from time to time, been made to the Vestry, as to its bad and neglected condition, shewing the necessity of its being paved and placed under the supervision of the Vestry, by the 105th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, being put into force. The Vestry were anxious to carry out the wishes of of the inhabitants, but the matter was environed with legal difficulties. The 105th Section of the Act enacts, "In case the owners of the 146 houses forming the greater part of any new street laid out or made, or hereafter to be laid out or made, which is not paved to the satisfaction of the Vestry." In this road there were only eleven houses, or, more properly, mansions erected, all standing in their own grounds. Thomas Tapling, Esq.'s mansion had a frontage of at least 750 feet. The mansion formerly occupied by the late Captain Pim, had a frontage of 400, and the others had less dimensions. It will therefore be seen, that inasmuch as it has been decided in several cases, that in order to constitute a new street under the said Section, that there must be a continuous row of houses on each side of the street ; and, also having regard to the language of the Section, the Vestry felt it necessary to consult counsel thereon, and he was of opinion that the road was wanting in the essential element to constitute a new street under the Statute, there not being a sufficient number of houses of continuous character, the Vestry, acting under such advice, did not deem it prudent further to proceed with the matter. The attention, however, of the Vestry was called again to the question by a resident in the neighbourhood, and the Vestry eventually took up the matter, and the General Purposes Committee, to whom the matter was referred, resolved to recommend the Vestry to take the opinion of the Magistrate whether the road was a new street within the meaning of the 105th Section, and for that purpose put in force the said Section. The Vestry adopted the recommendation. The Surveyor made his estimated expense, amounting at £2,047, and the Vestry apportioned the same amongst the owners. The contribution of Thomas Tapling, Esq., amounted to the large sum of £490 14s. l1d. All the owners paid the apportionments with a little murmuring save Mr. Tapling, whose solicitor 147 advised him to dispute the legality of the assessment on him. A summons was accordingly taken out. To prove the liability of Mr. Tapling, it was essential to prove that he was the owner of the estate and paying the rack rent for the house. It was also necessary to investigate the tenure under which the estate was held by him. It was found that he held the property under a lease granted to his late father by the Governors of Dulwich College in 1871, at a yearly rent of £255 for 54 years, which lease contained a covenant that he was to expend £2,000. It was also found that Mr. Tapling returned in his quinquennial return that the lease was worth £1,000. The late Mr. Tapling (the father), by his will, bequeathed the estate to trustees in trust for the defendant for life, and after his death to such person as he might direct. On the hearing of the summons the defendant's counsel took the following objections:— (1.) That Kingswood Road was not a new street under the Section. (2.) That he was not the owner, as the Governors of Dulwich College were in receipt of the rack rents. (3.) That the legal owners were the Trustees under the will to whom the estate has been bequeathed. The Court having heard the evidence in support of the defendant's defence, and having heard the evidence on behalf of the Vestry in support of their case, especially of Charles Barry, Esq., the Surveyor of Dulwich College, to whom I was indebted for his able and skilful evidence in support of the Vestry. The Magistrate decided:— 148 (1.) That Kingswood Road was a new street under the Statute. (2.) That the defendant was in receipt of the rack rent. (3.) That he was legal owner, and liable to pay £490 l1s. 4d., and costs, and made an order accordingly. The defendant applied for a Special Case on the two latter points. (The first point was a question of fact and not of law, and no case could be granted on that point.) The Court gave leave for a special case. The defendant ultimately abandoned it and paid the money. The Vestry have now paved and made up this road. Church Street Fair. Many complaints having been received from the Residents of Church Street, Camberwell, of a Fair, consisting of shows, roundabouts, &c., that was being held on a piece of ground at the rear of 22, Church Street, I was instructed to write to the Chief Commissioner of the Police, asking him to take proceedings under the Metropolitan Fair Act, 1868, a reply was received stating that there was no disorder, and that the Police did not propose to interfere in the matter. It was in the power of the Police to have issued a summons under the "Fair Act," but they declined to put the provisions of the Act in force. This nuisance continued for some time, and a Deputation of the Inhabitants attended the Vestry, and I was instructed to take proceedings, to compel the removal of the Fair. 149 A summons was accordingly issued under the Licensing Act for keeping a place of amusement without having first applied to the Quarter Sessions for a license. I found that this was the only method of reaching the evil. Upon the issue of the summons by me, the parties causing the nuisance moved away, and agreed not to place their shows in any other part of the Parish. East Dulwich Communication. The Vestry have for many years past had under their consideration the great importance of better road accommodation being provided to connect East Dulwich with the more populous part of the Parish. On the motion of Mr. Matthew Wallace the following resolution was passed:— "That in the opinion of this Vestry the time has now arrived when better road accommodation should be provided to connect East Dulwich with the more populous parts of the Parish." On the motion also of Mr. Wallace, a Special Committee was appointed to consider how best to give effect to the above resolution, and the following Members were appointed to form such Special Committee:—Messrs. Wallace, Bonsall, Lassam, Smith, Settles, Ballantine, Foskett, Jackson, Relph, Shipton, Norman, and Phillips. The Committee met, and considered the subject of the reference and the plans and scheme which had been prepared by the Surveyor for the Special East Dulwich Communication Committee in 188G, at a subsequent Meeting proceeded from the Old Kent Road by the Trafalgar Road, to East 150 Dulwich Station ; and it was fully reported upon to the Vestry, and the Vestry affixed their seal to the Petition to the London County Council, of which the following is a copy:— To the Chairman, Aldermen, and Members of County Council for the Administrative County of London. The PETITION of the Vestry of the Parish of Camberwell, in the County of Surrey, under their common seal. SHEWETH, THAT your Petitioners are the representatives of the Parish of Camberwell, as constituted under Schedule "A" of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. THAT the population of your Petitioners' Parish (which includes the Hamlet of Dulwich), and of the Parishes of Lambeth, Newington, St. George-the-Martyr, St. Saviour Southwark, and St. Olave, which comprise the greater part of South London, have increased during 10 years from 1871 to 1881 as follows:— THAT the population of these Parishes has, since the taking of the last census in 1881, still further increased and that of your Petitioners' Parish is now estimated at over 250,000, with a Rateable value of £1,036,340 made up of 37,700 Assessments. THAT in the East Dulwich portion of your 151 Petitioners' Parish alone there are about 858 empty houses with a Rateable value of £21,493, which inflicts a very heavy loss on the Ratepayers. THAT your Petitioners appointed a Special Committee to consider how best to give effect to the following resolution:— "That in the opinion of this Vestry the time has now arrived when better road accommodation should be provided to connect East Dulwich with the more populous parts of the Parish." THAT on the 27 th March last, the Special Committee reported to your Petitioners as follows:— "That your Committee having viewed and carefully considered the various routes at present leading to East Dulwich, are of opinion that the best would be that now proposed, commencing at the Old Kent Road, by the 'Lord Nelson,' thence by the Trafalgar and Sumner Roads, crossing High Street, Peckham, through Victoria Road, Bellenden Road, Adys Road to Goose Green, with a spur to East Dulwich Station (London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway), by extending Bellenden Road through vacant land to Placquett Road. "Your Committee have been much assisted by the labours of the previous Committee appointed to consider this matter, and have received much valuable help from the Surveyor, showing that a good thoroughfare from the Old Kent Road to St. 152 John's Church, Goo.se Green, with an additional spur to East Dulwich Station can be made for the sum of about £50,000, with a roadway varying from 40 to 50 feet in width." Your Petitioners therefore respectfully urge that for the reasons stated in the Report of the Special Committee as set out, and for the purpose of carrying out a much needed Metropolitan Improvement, your Honourable Council will exercise the power vested in them by Local Government Act, 1888, by undertaking the construction of the proposed road as shown on the plan submitted herewith, or in such other manner as may in the judgment of your Honourable Board be necessary to carry into effect this important improvement. YOUR PETITIONERS therefore humbly pray that your Honourable Council for the reason set forth in the Petition, and having regard to the great important Public Improvement, will carry into effect this or such other scheme as in your judgment may be necessary or expedient to open up direct communication from East Dulwich to the populous parts of South London. The Seal of the Vestry was hereto affixed at a Meeting held the 10th day of April, 1889. By Order, GEO. W. MAESDEW, Vestry Clerk. 153 The Vestry deemed it best to approach, by way of deputation, the London County Council, also with plans and specifications showing the proposed route from Old Kent Road to Goose Green, with an additional spur to East Dulwich Station. In accordance with the decision of the Vestry, a Deputation attended the Improvements Committee of the Council, and after hearing a most lucid and able exposition of the importance of the scheme from Mr. G. C. Whiteley, the Committee promised to give the matter their careful consideration. I regret to state that a reply has been received from the London County Council, stating that owing to so many similar applications being made to the Council, they were unable at present to carry out the suggested improvement. The matter has been again referred by the Vestry to the Special Committee. Appointment of Medical Officer. The following Report of Sewers and Sanitary Committee as to General Order (Metropolis) of the Local Government Board (28th March, 1889), with Regulations as to Medical Officers of Health, was presented to the Vestry:— Reporting:—That the Vestry Clerk has submitted a letter he has received from the Secretary of the Local Government Board enclosing the orders and regulations of that Board, in regard to the qualifications, appointment, salary, and term of 154 office of the Medical Officer of Health to be hereafter appointed by the Vestry. The 88th Section of the Local Government Act, 1888, incorporates the 191st Section of the Public Health Act, 1875, which enacts that no person shall be elected a Medical Officer of Health unless the appointment and salary be approved of by the Local Government Board; and by another Section in the Local Government Act it is enacted that the County Council shall, from the 31st March last, pay out of the County fund one half of the salary of such Medical Officer when his qualifications, appointment, salary, and term of office are in accordance with the Regulations of the Local Government Board. The Board are also empowered to prescribe regulations in regard to those Medical Officers of Health whose salary will be wholly paid by the Vestry. The Order of the Local Government Board is divided into two parts, viz.:— Part I. Relating to every Medical Officer of Health appointed after the 1st April, 1889, one half of whose salary will be payable to the Vestry by the London County Council. Part II. To every Medical Officer of Health appointed on and after that time whose salary will be wholly paid by the Vestry. 155 AS TO PART 1. APPOINTMENT OF MEDICAL OFFICER. Art. 1. A statement shall be submitted to us (The Local Government Board) on a form to be supplied by us, with all particulars as may be prescribed by us, with the salary intended to be paid. Art. 2. When our approval (Local Government Board) has been given, the Vestry shall proceed to the appointment of the Medical Officer of Health. Art, 3. Relates to advertising appointment. Art. 4. Every Medical Officer shall be appointed by a majority of the Members of the Vestry, such appointment to be subject to our (Local Government Board) approval. Art. 5. Relates to Vacancy. Art. 6. If in the case of an Officer holding office at the date of this Order, the Local Authority desire to appoint him under this Order, or if, in the case of an Officer who may have been appointed under this Order for a specified term, the Local Authority should desire to renew his appointment for a further term, or otherwise in conformity with the provisions of this Order, it shall not be necessary for L 156 notice of the proposed appointment or renewal to be given by advertisement, if notice be given at one of the two ordinary Meetings of the Local Authority next preceding the Meeting at which the appointment is made or renewed. Art. 7. Relates to illness of Medical Officer. Art. 8. Every Officer shall continue to hold office for such period as the Vestry may with our approval determine, or until he dies, or resigns, or is removed by such Authority with our approval, or shall be removed by us (Local Government Board). Art. 9. Power to suspend Officer with consent of the Local Government Hoard. Art. 10. Notice to determine appointment. Art. 11. A month's notice necessary. Art. 12. The Local Authority shall pay to every Officer such salary as may be approved by us. Art. 13, 14 and 15. As to payment of salary. Art. 16. Duties of Medical Officers of Health, detailed in Sub-sections 1 to 19. Your Committee felt anxious to ascertain 157 the sentiments of Dr. Bristowe, as the Regulations more particularly affected him, and therefore referred the Order of the Local Government Board to him to report upon. The following is a copy of his report:— "I have carefully perused and considered the documents recently sent down to the Vestry from the Local Government Board, in which are set forth the effect of the Local Government Act, 1888, on the relations between Medical Officers of Health, Vestries, County Council, and Local Government Board in the Metropolis. The documents are:— 1st. A General Order of the Local Government Board reciting the Clauses of the Act under which they acquire powers over the Medical Officer of Health, and giving in detail the regulations with regard to his appointment, tenure of office, salary and duties. 2nd. An explanatory memorandum addressed to the Vestry Clerk. 3rd. A form of proposal for appointment of Medical Officers of Health. It appears that any Metropolitan Officer of Health who may be appointed in the future, will be appointed under exactly the same conditions as at present govern the appointment of provincial officers 158 of Health. Under any circumstances he will be largely under the immediate control of the Local Government Board, which in the Schedule of his duties (most of which are such as by law he is required to perform at the present time), prescribes "that he shall also observe and execute any instructions issued by us," namely, the Local Goverment Board. A new appointment may be made in one of two ways, at the option of the Vestry: either the Vestry may pay the Medical Officer's whole salary, or they may require that one half of his salary shall be paid by the County Council. In the former case the Vestry may elect whomsoever they please, provided he is duly qualified, may pay him what salary they please, and (excepting for the newly acquired influence of the Local Government Board above adverted to) will maintain in all respects the same relations with their Officer of Health as they now hold; in the latter case (that is, when half of the Officer's salary is obtained from the County Council), the Local Government Board at once acquire, in virtue of that payment, large influence over the conditions of his appointment. All the Vestry's actions in relation to the Officer of Health must receive the sanction of the Local Government Board, which will have the power of determining the amount of his salary; whether or not he shall 159 devote his whole time to his sanitary duties; and whether or not a particular candidate for office whom the Vestry elect, shall receive the appointment. And further, they will be able on the one hand to remove him from office, and on the other hand to prevent the Vestry from removing him. 1 have good reason to believe (although it does not appear from the documents on which I am reporting), that any new appointments of Medical Officers of Health will be made subject to a future re-arrangement of districts for Sanitary purposes; and that, as regards those in respect of which half the salary is paid by the County Council, the Local Government Board will require that the Officer's whole time shall be devoted to the duties of his office, I need hardly say, with an increased salary. I may add that the Orders and Regulations of the Local Government Board do not affect Metropolitan Officers of Health, elected prior to the coming into operation of the Local Government Act, 1888, and that in order to bring these within their operation it will be necessary for them to resign, and then to tender themselves for re-election." (Signed), J. S. Bkistowe. Your Committee having carefully considered the Order, together with the Report of Dr. Bristowe thereon, have to express their regret 160 that an Act of Parliament, bearing the title of a "Local Government Act," should, by an incorporated clause, place the control, salary, and right of removal of the Medical Officer of Health under a Government Department, which is subversive of all the principles of local self government, and one which deprives the Vestries of the legitimate control of its own Officers. Fortunately it will not yet take effect, as the Act only applies to future appointments, unless the Vestry should desire to place itself under the regulations of the Local Government Board. Dr. Bristowe (who was appointed thirty-four years ago to the position now held by him) has zealously and ably discharged his duties during the whole of this long period, more especially during the visitation of Cholera and other dangerous epidemics, when he was able, by his eminent position in his profession, to render most valuable assistance to the Parishioners. Your Committee believe that the Vestry wish to recognise the services of Dr. Bristowe, and will not desire to displace him by the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health under the terms of the Order, who would probably be a man of inferior rank in his profession with an increased salary. Your Committee therefore unanimousl:— Recommend:—That the Local Government. Board be informed that this Vestry appreciate the 161 services of their present Medical Officer, and the manner in which he has discharged his duties for the past thirty-four years; and having regard to his high qualifications for the office, consider that any appointment under the Order would not be advantageous to the Parish, and therefore the Vestry do not propose to avail themselves of the Order. R. T. BONSALL, Chairman. Vestry Hall, Camber well, April 30th, 1889. A PPENDIX. (letter from local government board.) 30th March, 1889. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to draw attention to paragraph (c) of Section 88 of the Local Government Act, 1888, by which section 191 of the Public Health Act, 1875, is, after the 1st of April, 1889, made applicable to the Metropolis in like manner as if the Commissioners 162 of Sewers in the City of London, and every Vestry of a parish in Schedule A., and District Board of a district in Schedule B. to the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, or under any Act amending the same, were a local authority within the meaning of that section, and as if any medical officer of health hereafter appointed by such Commissioners, Vestry, or District Board were appointed under the Public Health Act. It is also enacted that the provisions of the Local Government Act with respect to the qualification of a medical officer or to the payment by a county council of a portion of the salary of a medical officer shall apply accordingly. Under section 24 (2) (c) of the Local Government Act, which is thus made applicable to the Metropolis, so far as medical officers of health are concerned, it will devolve on the London County Council to pay, to every local authority for any area in the county by whom a medical officer of health is paid, one half of the salary of such officer, where his qualification, appointment, salary, and tenure of office are in accordance with the regulations made by Order under the Public Health Act, 1875; and by section 191 of the Public Health Act, as amended by section 24 (3) of the Local Government Act, the Board are empowered to prescribe regulations in regard to the qualification, appointment, duties, salary and tenure of office of a medical officer of 163 health in respect of whose salary payment will be made by the County Council. The Board are also empowered to prescribe regulations in regard to the qualification and duties of a medical officer of health, no portion of whose salary will be so paid. The Board have accordingly issued an Order containing regulations with regard to the matters above mentioned, and two copies of it are enclosed. The Order is divided into two parts, Part I. relating to every medical officer of health appointed on or after the 1st of April, 1889, one half of whose salary will be payable to the local authority by the London County Council, and Part II. to every medical officer of health appointed on or after the date referred to, no part of whose salary will be payable by the London County Council. In Part II. the duties only of the medical officer of health are prescribed; but Part I. deals with the appointment, tenure of office, and remuneration, as well as with the duties of any medical officer of health to whom that Part applies. It will be observed that before a local authority proceed to the appointment of a medical 104 officer of health, one half of whose salary will he payable by the county council, a statement is to be submitted to the Board, in a prescribed form, indicating the proposals of the local authority in regard to the district for which the officer is intended to be employed, the salary to be assigned to him, and certain other particulars. Two copies of the form of statement are enclosed for use in case the local authority should decide to make an appointment with a view to repayment by the county council of one half of the salary of the medical officer of health. Until the proposals contained in the statement have been submitted to and approved by the Board, the local authority should not proceed with the appointment of the officer. When such approval has been obtained, the next step, unless the case conies within Article 6, will be to insert, in some public newspaper circulating in the district of the local authority, and at least seven days before the day fixed for the appointment, an advertisement containing the particulars mentioned in Article 3 of the Order. The appointment will be subject to the Board's approval. If the local authority wish to obtain payment from the county council in respect of the future salary of a medical officer of health in office on the 1st of April, it is necessary that he should be 165 pointed under the Order, but in such a case the Board do not consider it needful that an advertisement should be published in a newspaper of the proposal to appoint the officer. They have therefore provided by Article 6 that it shall not be requisite in any case of this kind to give notice by advertisement, if notice be given at one of the two ordinary meetings of the local authority next preceding the meeting at which the appointment is to be made. The Article will also apply in cases in which it is hereafter desired to renew appointments made under the Order for a specified term. Article 5 has been inserted with a view to enable a local authority to provide in certain cases for filling up a vacancy about to arise in the office of medical officer of health, before the vacancy has actually arisen, and Article 7 provides for the remuneration of a person employed to act as a substitute for a medical officer who may be temporarily prevented by sickness or accident, or other sufficient reason, from performing his duties. Articles 8 to 11 refer to the tenure of office of medical officers of health appointed under the Order. Articles 12 to 15 relate to the salaries of officers so appointed, and Article 16 to their duties. It will be observed that the salary payable to any such officer must be approved by the Board. 166 The Board do not consider it necessary to refer in detail to the duties prescribed by the Order for medical officers of health. For the most part they are analogous to those at present prescribed for medical officers of health appointed under the Public Health Act, 1875. It will be observed that paragraph (16) of Article 16 will require the medical officer of health to transmit to the Board a copy of each annual and of any special report. It is important that this should be done, as, if the Board certify that the requirement has not been complied with, a sum equal to one half of his salary will be forfeited to the Crown, under section 24 (2) (c) of the Local Government Act, and must be paid by the county council into the Exchequer, and not to the local authority. A copy of each report, whether annual or special, must be sent to the London County Council by the medical officer of health, and, if a copy of each annual report is not so sent, the county council may refuse to pay any contribution which otherwise they would, in pursuance of the Act, pay towards the salary of the officer. See section 19 (1). It will also be the duty of the medical officer of health to give immediate information to the Board and to the London County Council of any 167 outbreak of dangerous epidemic disease within his district. The duties assigned by Part II. of the Order to a medical officer of health, no part of whose salary is payable by the London County Council, will be the same as those assigned in the cases in which half of the salary will be paid, with the addition that under Article 17 (1) of the Order, it will be incumbent on the officer within seven days after his appointment to report the same in writing to the Board. I am directed to add that the Board have not thought it necessary to prescribe any qualification for medical officers of health in the metropolis, as this matter appears to them to be sufficiently dealt with by section 18 of the Local Government Act, taken in connexion with section 88 (c). Having regard to these enactments, it seems to the Board that, except where they, for reasons brought to their notice, may see fit specially to allow, no person can hereafter be appointed the medical officer of health of any district in the metropolis, or the deputy of any such officer, unless he is legally qualified for the practice of medicine, surgery, and midwifery. Moreover, after the 1st of January, 1 892, no person can be appointed the medical officer of 168 health of any district in the metropolis which contained, according to the last published census for the time being, 50,000 or more inhabitants, unless he is qualified as above-mentioned, and also either is registered in the medical register as the holder of a diploma in sanitary science, public health, or State Medicine, under section 21 of the Medical Act, 1886, or has been during three consecutive years preceding the year 1892 a medical officer of a district, or combination of districts, with a population, according to the last published census, of not less than 20,000 inhabitants, or has, before the passing of the Local Government Act, been for not less than three years a medical officer or inspector of the Board. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, HUGH OWEN, Secretary. To The Clerk to the Vestry of Camberwell. 1 The Vestry decided, upon the consideration of such report, to convene a Conference of Delegates from the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis thereon, such Conference was held at the Vestry Hall, when the following Local Authorities were represented:— VESTRIES : Clerkenwell, Hammersmith, Newington, Paddington, St. Pancras, Bethnal Green, (Kensington, St. George-in-the-East, St. George's, Southwark, Camberwell. The Board of Works for the Plumstead, St. Saviour's, and Poplar District. The following Vestries and District Boards resolved to take no action under the Order of the Local Government Board, as to the appointment of Medical Officers of Health, and therefore did not appoint Delegates:— Vestry of Hackney. Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Board of Works for the St. Giles' District. Board of Works for the Holborn District. Board of Works for the Wandsworth District. Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Vestry of St. Mary, Islington. Vestry of St. Mary, Lambeth. The following appointed their Medical Officer of Health under the Order of the Local Government Board:— Board of Works for the Limehouse District. 170 Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea. Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Many other Vestries and District Boards still had the matter under their consideration. George Crispe Whiteley, Esq., M.A., presided over the Conference. When the following Resolutions were passed:— " That pending further legislation upon the subject, it is not desirable at present to alter in any way the relationship between the Medical Officers of Health and the Local Authority, and that therefore no action be taken upon the Order of the Local Government Board (dated March 28th, 1889)." "That a copy of the resolution be forwarded to all the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards; the Local Government Board; and the London County Council." "That the best thanks of this Conference be given to the Camberwell Vestry for convening this Meeting, and to the Chairman for his able conduct in the Chair." Canterbury Road Paving the last Report I had the pleasure of report- that the proceedings which had been taken against Mr. Stotesbury for the recovery of £613, the amount of his apportionment in this road, had been successful, the Appeal by him to the Court of Queen's Bench having been dismissed by the Judges. Mr. Stotesbury has now paid his 171 contribution, and the paving of this street has been carried out as far as the approaches of the Bridge, now being erected by the London County Council, will allow. It is with satisfaction that I have to report the completion of the paving of this road, after the litigation which has been pending for some years—-the Vestry having at length been enabled to carry out this long-needed improvement to the Parish. Canterbury Road Bridge. pleased to inform the Vestry that the construction of this bridge is now rapidly approaching completion, the work which is being carried out by theLondon County Council, will not only be a local benefit but a Metropolitan improvement,. Public Libragies It Will be seen on reference to the last Annual Report, that the generous offer of Mr. Livesey to present a Public Library to the Parish had been accepted by the Vestry. The Special Committee appointed made the following Recommendations, which were approved by the Vestry on the 30th May, 1888:— 1. That Mr. Livesey's generous offer be accepted. 2. That an appeal be immediately made by this Vestry for aid in providing three additional Institutions. 3. That the necessary steps be taken to bring the Libraries Act into operation, the Rate not to exceed one halfpenny in the pound. 4. That your Committee be instructed to carry out the foregoing Resolutions. M 172 In furtherance of this a large Public Meeting was held at the Peckham Public Hall, on Tuesday, October 23rd, 1888, Mr. G. C. Whiteley, M.A., presiding, and he was supported by Sir Edward Clarke, Q.C., M.P. (SolicitorGeneral), Mr. Geo. Livesey, The Rev. G. \V. Daniell, M.A., Rev. H. B. Chapman, Rev. O. Thorpe, Rev. W. Jennings, The Rev. Canon McGrath, Rev. G. Buchanan Ryley, Rev. J. Perkins, Rev. J. C. Postans, Mr. J. Pellatt Rickman, Mr. R. Strong, J. P., Mr. E. Dresser Rogers, Mr. G. L. Turney, J.P., and many Members of the Vestry. Numerous letters were received in support of the movement from those who were unable to attend the Meeting, among them being the following:— Mr. A. A. Baumann, M.P., wrote:—"I am heartily in sympathy with the establishment of Free Libraries under the Act of Parliament, and 1 trust that the Ratepayers will adopt the recommendation of the Vestry." The Rev. C. E. Brooke regretted he would be unable to be present, adding that he need hardly say how entirely his sympathies were with the Free Libraries movement. Canon Fleming, formerly Vicar of Camden Church, wrote:—" Education is the only fortune a man cannot run through, and the only safe foundation upon which any true fortune can be built." Mr. James Henderson wrote:—" I can assure you I am heartily in favour of Free Libraries in 173 Camberwell, and support the recommendation of the Vestry to put the Free Libraries Act into force." A Resolution in favour of the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts was unanimously carried. In pursuance of the provisions of the Public Libraries Act, a requisition was duly signed by a number of Ratepayers calling upon the Overseers to ascertain the determination of the Ratepayers as to whether the Public Libraries Act should be adopted for this Parish ; and the Overseers decided that the best method of ascertaining the wishes of the Ratepayers was by the issue of voting papers to each Ratepayer, and the subsequent collection and scrutiny thereof. The Ratepayers were by such voting papers given the opportunity of stipulating whether, in their opinion, the adoption of the Acts should be subject to a limitation to some lower rate than One Penny in the £ The poll of the Parish was taken on the 7th January last, with the following result:— o In favour of the adoption of the Acts— Limited to ¼d. in the pound 209 do. ½d. do. 1,783 do. ¼d. do. 148 Without stipulation 9,267 11,407 Against 5,357 Majority in favour 7,050 174 A majority of Ratepayers having decided that the Public Libraries Acts should be adopted, the Vestry on the 30th January, 1889, appointed the following Commissioners: Geo. Livesey, Esq. George Crispe Whiteley, Esq.

Death of During the past year the Vestry had to deplore The loss of Andrew Middlemass ; and at the Vestry Meeting held on the 16th January last, they recognised his great services by unanimously passing the following resolution:— Resolved:—"That this Vestry desire to place on record their deep regret at the death of their Colleague, Mr. Andrew Middlemass, and to express their high appreciation of the able, devoted, and valuable services rendered to the Vestry and his fellow parishioners during the long period of 20 years, in which he was a Member of the Vestry. He was 175 a powerful and talented debater, a great administrative organiser, possessed of rare and sound judgment, and a clear and eloquent exponent of the laws relating to local government of the Parish in all its branches. Above all his unselfish fidelity and honesty of purpose were paramount in his transactions with the Vestry. The Vestry recognising in him these great qualities he was selected to fill the following important positions:—He was elected a Member of the Sewer and Sanitary Committee, and chosen Chairman for two years. Subsequently he was appointed a Member of the General Purposes Committee, and for nine successive years he performed the onerous duties of Chairman with conspicuous ability. He also rendered good and faithful services as Overseer of the Poor for two years; and on the Metropolis Valuation Act (1869) coming into operation, he was elected the Chairman of the Assessment Committee, and all the Assessments of this large Parish were then revised and settled under the Act. The Vestry in 1885 were empowered to elect an additional Member to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and Mr. Middlemass was cordially and unanimously elected a representative. His extensive knowledge of Parochial affairs, together with his genial and kind manners, won for him the regard and esteem of his fellow Vestrymen. The Vestry, in bearing a tribute of respect to his memory, desire not to forget his bereaved widow and family; and they respectfully tender them their heartfelt sorrow at the loss they have sustained by his death, and their sincere condolence in their heavy bereavement." 176 THE FOLLOWING REPORTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE COMMISSIONERS OF BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES FOR THIS PARISH. Report of the Commissioners of Public Baths and Wash-houses of Camberwell. We, the Commissioners, beg to report that the Vestry having deferred its decision in reference to the proposition as to the Birkbeck site until negotiations had been entered into with the proprietor of the Victoria Baths, Martin's Road, Peckham, steps were at once taken to ascertain whether that establishment could be obtained for the purposes of Public Baths and Wash-houses, and at what cost. Having found that Mr. Higgs, the proprietor, was willing to dispose of the baths for £13,500, we personally surveyed the buildings and the vacant ground, together with the approaches from the High Street and Sumner Road. The Victoria Baths consist of a 1st class swimming bath 100 feet by 3G feet, with 79 dressing boxes ; a 2nd class swimming bath, 125 feet by 40 feet with 130 recesses; but these are without the privacy of doors or curtains The 1st class bath is used largely by swimming clubs. Of private baths there are 30, all of one class, and four of these are set apart for women, but the fact that they are approached through the same waiting room as the other 26, that the passage to the 26 passes between the four bath 177 rooms for women, there being two on either side, and that the partitions separating the men's from the women's baths do not reach the ceiling, prevents sufficient privacy being afforded to the women. Being desirous of giving the Vestry the fullest possible information on this subject, we instructed Mr. Thomas Wilkins, C.E., to survey the existing baths, machinery, and pumping apparatus, and to report to us as to how they could best be extended and adapted to render them suitable for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and at what probable cost. He has made a most thorough and exhaustive examination of every part of the establishment and its plant, and finds that there is space enough to erect the additional private baths required, viz.:—Second class for men, and first and second class for women; also for wash-houses, with drying and ironing rooms complete. The pumping engine in the well is much out of order, and would have to undergo a thorough repair, and additional boiler power would have to be provided to meet the requirements of the enlarged establishment. He is further of opinion that it would be necessary in order to secure a suitable approach from the Northern end of the buildings, to purchase two cottages in Canal Row, and that the total cost, if the price asked by Mr. Higgs is given, will not be less than £21,000. We having now carefully considered the whole question, have come to the conclusion that we can in no way approve of the purchase of the Victoria Baths in lieu of the site recommended in our previous report, for the following reasons. 178 1. That the very large and necessitous portion of the Parish which would be supplied by the Birk beck site, would be almost entirely unprovided for by the Victoria Baths. 2. That by the selection of the Birkbeck site a saving of at least £7,000 would be effected. 3. That it is our decided opinion that the Birkbeck establishment would yield a fair trading return, while the approaches to the Victoria Baths (especially at the North end which is completely hemmed in) and the situation are such as to render it more than probable that the annual trading account would have to be balanced by a contribution out of the rates. We have therefore decided to adhere to our first proposal, and trust that the Vestry will, without further delay, sanction the borrowing of the necessary sum of money so that the Birkbeck site may be immediately acquired, and steps be taken to secure the opening of the establishment before the bathing season of 1889 commences. Mr. Pennack, the freeholder of the Birkbeck site, has expressed his willingness to reduce his price to £4,600, or to submit to an independent valuation to be obtained by us, and we, believing that £13,000 will cover the entire cost of the establishment, are prepared to substitute that amount for the £15,000 previously named. We have the greater confidence in recommending this site, from the fact that the three swimming; baths which would be provided would give 25 more dressing boxes than 179 are given at the Tottenham Court Road Baths (which are perhaps the most successful in London), while the private bathing accommodation would be equal to either Bermondsey or Rotherhithe, more than double that of Ladywell, and nearly double that of Forest Hill. Then, in regard to position, it must be borne in mind, that the Birkbeck site, though situate in No. 5 Ward, is in direct touch with the whole of No. 2 Ward, and lame portions of Nos. 1 and 4 Wards; there are several large factories within five or ten minutes' walk, employing more than 2,000 hands. We wish it to be clearly understood that we do not consider that the work entrusted to us by the Vestry will be complete until the whole of the Parish is provided with adequate bathing and washing accommodation. Having, however, a site in view which we consider most desirable for one portion of the Parish, we feel that it is the safest and wisest course to concentrate our attention upon the district now under consideration, rather than have it divided between other districts at the same time. Trusting that the Vestry will now give the matter their favourable consideration, and will support the Commissioners in the proposition which they make, and not withhold from one of the most densely populated and necessitous portions of the Parish the boon which it was so recently decided to bestow. All of which is submitted. JAMES T. SEARS, Chairman of the Commissioners. 180 The Vestry referred this matter hack to the Commissioners for further report as to the Victoria Baths. Report of the Commissioners of Public Baths and Wash-houses of Camberwell, upon the resolution of the Vestry of October 10th, 1888, with plans of the Victoria Baths, as directed, and also further as to the Birkbeck Site. To the Members of the Cambemvell Vestry. In accordance with the Resolution passed at the Vestry Meeting, on October 10th, to the effect:— "That the question be referred back with a view to the Commissioners providing and furnishing to this Vestry a descriptive plan of the whole of the Victoria Baths, land, and approaches, as offered to the said Commissioners for the sum named (£13,500)," the Commissioners now submit the plans of the Victoria Baths, and land adjacent, together with the approaches. The suggestion as to the purchase of the two small cottages shewn upon the plan, is in order to give greater facilities of approach from the northern end of the site, which would be required for the Wash-house arrangement, and also to enable the coals to be delivered by barge instead of by vans as now, the present arrangement involving the carrying of the coals in sacks a distance of at least 120 feet. 181 We regret that we cannot recommend the acquirement of this site, and we have therefore no further report to make in connection with it. We regard this matter entirely from a public standpoint, and had we adopted any other course we should have been sacrificing the public interests for the interests of a private concern, and in so doing would have been acting contrary to our sense of duty to the Ratepayers. Our reasons for recommending the Birkbeck site, and for not supporting the Victoria Baths proposal have already been stated, and are as follows:— We believe that the position of the Birkbeck site is one that will supply the needs of a very large and populous portion of the Parish left untouched by the Victoria Baths. We further feel that the Victoria Baths supply a portion of the Parish which the Birkbeck site would not supply, and the fact that they are largely used by swimming clubs, and that, in all probability, the first-class private bathing would be but little, if at all, interfered with, would prevent the present trading account being seriously affected by an establishment in another portion of the Parish. By our proposal, therefore, a second Establishment would be brought into existence, so that by the expenditure of a smaller sum of money than would be required to purchase and adapt the Victoria Baths, two Establishments would be secured to the Parish instead of one, and this we consider to be a decided gain. 182 Taking into consideration the, fact that on two occasions the Vestry has voted against the acquirement of the Birkbeck Buildings, we feel that it would not be courteous to press that proposal further upon the attention of the Vestry. We have ascertained that Mr. Pennack is willing to dispose of the land without the buildings, but the price named by him, viz.: £3,750, is higher than the Commissioners feel justified in giving, but they will be prepared to purchase the land, clear of the buildings, for £3,000, upon the sanction of the Vestry being given to the borrowing of £18,000, for purchase of site and erection of entirely new buildings. We desire to leave the question as to whether an entirely new Establishment shall be provided upon the Birk beck site in the hands of the Vestry. It is the only proposition which we can now make for that portion of the Parish, and should this not be agreed to, the responsibility of withholding the advantages of the Public Baths and Wash-houses Act from this District must rest upon the Vestry. In reference to the other portions of the Parish, we shall be glad to receive suggestions as to sites from any of the members of the Vestry, and in regard to all matters having to do with the carrying out of the Act, we shall be pleased to receive the co-operation and advice of any of our colleagues on the Vestry. JAMES T. SEARS, Chairman. October 31st, 1888. 183 Upon this report it was moved by Mr. Winyard:— That this Vestry hereby approve of the Commissioners of Public Baths and Wash-houses purchasing the land cleared of the buildings known as the Birkbeck Schools situate in Willow brook Road, Peckham and in pursuance of the Act 9 and 10 Vic., chap. 74, 'An Act to encourage the establishment of Baths and Wash-houses,' do sanction the Commissioners with the approval of the Local Government Board borrowing the sum of £18,000 to be paid by 30 yearly instalments with interest thereon, to be secured by the rates, for the relief of the poor of the Parish." This motion was negatived by the Vestry. In December last three Commissioners, Messrs. E. C. Davis, Dowton and Turney, retired in accordance with the provisions of the Baths and Wash-houses Act, and upon an election being held by the Vestry, Messrs. Turney, Relph and Wallace were appointed Commissioners in their stead. 184 FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS. We, the Commissioners, beg to report that we have unanimously appointed George Crispe Whiteley, Esq., Chairman, Joseph Faulkner, Esq., Vice-Chairman, and Sir George R. Prescott, Bart., Treasurer. It is gratifying that the first business of the Commissioners was the receipt of the following letter:— " Fountain Court, Temple, E.C., "February 12th, 1889. " Dear Mr. Whiteley, " Camberwell having adopted the Free Libraries Act I am desirous to do what I can towards giving the scheme a fair start, I therefore offer to the Commissioners the Hall which stands at the corner of the Burton and Knatchbull Roads, to be used for the purpose of a Free Public Library only. "The building, with some slight alterations, which shall be made, will be found perfectly adapted for the purpose if the Commissioners are of opinion that the position is a suitable one. " Yours truly, "G. Whiteley, Esq. "WILLIAM MINET." The generous offer of Mr. Minet was gladly accepted by us on behalf of the Ratepayers, and we took the first 185 opportunity of viewing the building with him, subsequently several interviews were had by the Chairman with Mr. Minet, and he met the wishes of the Commissioners in a most liberal spirit, and expressed his willingness to adapt the present building for the purposes of a Public Library by the erection of a Librarian's house and Lending Library adjoining. This Library being on the borders of Lambeth Parish, we came to the conclusion that the Ratepayers of that Parish would benefit equally with our own, and we requested our Chairman to put himself into communication with Mr. Evan Spicer, one of the Lambeth Commissioners thereon, and we also wrote to that body, that having regard to the position of the building, and the great benefit it would confer on their Parish, whether they would be prepared to contribute £500, halt' the estimated cost of furnishing the Library with books, and also the like proportion of the cost of the future maintenance of such building, and in the event of their acceding to such re- quest, we deemed it only just that three Commissioners should be appointed by Lambeth to assist in the management of such Library. The Lambeth Commissioners expressed their willingness to comply with our request, but the question arose whether the Act allowed them to contribute to a Library in another Parish. A Bill was then before Parliament for the Amendment of the Public Libraries Acts, upon the question of rating land, and it was at once deemed advisable to take advantage of this Bill to obtain the introduction of a clause allowing one Parish to contribute to a Library in 186 another; through the activity of Mr. Evan Spicer, such a clause was drafted and submitted to Mr. Ritchie, President of the Local Government Board, approved by him, inserted in the Bill, and within a month the following clause had received the royal consent, and become law:— "3. It shall be lawful for the Commissioners, separately appointed under the Public Libraries [England] Acts, 1855 to 1887, for any two or more adjoining parishes, with the consent of the vestries of such parishes, from time to time to agree to share in such proportions and for such period as may be determined by the agreement, the cost of the purchase, erection, repair, and maintenance of any library building situate in one of such parishes, and also the cost of the purchase of books, periodicals, and newspapers for such library, and all other expenses connected with the same; and the inhabitants of both or all the said parishes, as the case may be, shall be entitled to use the said library so long as the agreement shall continue in force. "And any such agreement may provide that upon its termination an adjustment shall be made of the interests of the several Commissioners in the library, building, books, and other property to which they have contributed, and as to the mode in which such adjustment shall be arrived at."—Public Libraries Acts Amendment Act, 1889, Vict. 52, c. 9. We must congratulate the Parishioners on being indirectly the means of such an important and valuable addition to the law. 187 At the request of Mr. Livesey we thought it desirable to view the site in Old Kent Road, presented by him for the purpose of a Public Library, before any steps had been taken in the building of this Library ; and he expressed his desire for the Commissioners to select an Architect. Ultimately, Mr. Whellock, of Camberwell, was selected, and sent in designs which were submitted to us, and which were after various suggestions adopted. This Library is now in course of erection, and it is hoped that in a few months it will be open for the use and benefit of the Parishioners. We have been engaged in the consideration of other sites, and negotiating for the purchase of land and premises in suitable positions, but we have nothing definite at present to report. We trust that without undue delay the Ratepayers will be in possession of Libraries throughout the Parish, in fulfilment of the charge entrusted to us by the Vestry. Given under our Seal. 189 Report of the Burial Board The Board report that the total number of interments for the year 1888-9 was 3690. The appendix is a detailed account of such interments. private graves, etc. In consequence of the great increase in the number of interments, both Parishioners and non-Parishioners, and the purchase of private graves by the latter, the Board, after much consideration, deemed it expedient to pass a resolution that the Cemetery should, for the future, be reserved for the exclusive use of the Parishioners ; the resolution not to effect the right to interment of non-Parishioners in graves previously purchased. roads and pathways. The road and pathways requiring considerable repairs, the Board advertised for tenders, and that of Messrs. Mowlem & Co. for £411 being the lowest was accepted, and the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the Board; the drains, being found insufficient to carry off the water, have been replaced by larger ones, where required, and thoroughly repaired throughout, at a cost of over £300. The Board have had to meet the precept from the Vestry for £770 3s. for the paving of Underhill Road. 100 The Board also have during the past financial year paid the Overseers a sum of £2,000, being surplus funds after paying the Cemetery expenses. resignation of the chaplain. The Board regret to state that they received the resignation of the Rev. Dr. Thomas Morgan, who had performed the duties of Chaplain in the Consecrated portion of the Cemetery for a period of 14 years, and that the Rev. F. F. Kelly, conjointly with the Vicars of the several Ecclesiastical Parishes of Camberwell, have appointed the Rev. J. C. Eyre Kitson as Chaplain, in place of Dr. Morgan. On the resignation of Dr. Morgan, the Board passed a resolution and presented an address to him, referring to the amicable relations that had existed for 14 years, and expressing their regret at losing his valuable services.

Report of the Auditors to the Vestry respecting the Accounts for the Year ending March 25th, 1889. Vestry Hall, Camberwell, July 27th, 1889. Gentlemen, We, being the duly appointed Auditors of the above Parish, have to report, that in accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, we have carefully examined and audited the Books of Accounts with the Vouchers relating thereto for the period from the 26th March, 1888, to the 25th of March, 1889, both days inclusive, and submit the following report thereon. That having examined the Rate Books with Collectors' receipts, and the Vestry General Accounts, we are satisfied with the correctness of the same. With regard to the Burial Board Accounts your Auditors are pleased to report that all the books, including those kept by the Superintendent at the Cemetery, are in perfect order. Re, the Charity Accounts:— We again notice that in some instances monies from the Samaritan Fund have been 238 given more than once to the same persons, by different distributors. We would therefore recommend that a district be assigned to each distributor, and that no persons should receive any sum outside the district in which they reside. In conclusion, your Auditors beg to acknowledge the courtesy of the various heads, and take this opportunity of thanking them for the valuable assistance rendered by them. William Davis, Chairman, J.
