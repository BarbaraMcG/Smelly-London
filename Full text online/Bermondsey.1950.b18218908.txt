HEALTH AND EDUCATION FILM DISPLAYS The following film displays were given during the year:— To Youth Organisations 11 attended by 520 „ Adult Organisations 97 „ 4,385 108 4,905 To carry out this work the "Existing Audience System" was used as in past years. This means that almost every organisation holding meetings in the borough was, by arrangement with its officers or leaders, given a number of monthly film displays, which consisted of two or three documentary films of general interest together with a film on health or hygiene. That these visits continue to be successful there is little doubt, particularly if the enthusiasm and appreciation of the audiences are any criterion. The alternative method is by the "Invited Audience System." This, as the name implies, means inviting the public to specially arranged lectures or displays and, although this Department has often used this method, it has the disadvantage of providing only an occasional event, whereas by the "Existing Audience System" many different audiences are met day after day, week after week throughout the year. ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGN During 1950 assistance was again given to the Road Safety SubCommittee. Films on road safety have been shown at many of the above meetings as well as at displays arranged specifically for road safety propaganda. The number of such displays was 19 attended by approximately 4,410 persons. CIVIL DEFENCE CORPS The projector equipment and organisation for dealing with films was found to be most useful to the Civil Defence Corps during the year. Special Home Office training films were obtained and shown as required at lectures to trainees. Similar assistance was given to members of the Police Force, "M' Division, concerned with civil defence. There were, altogether, 31 occasions on which these films were used. PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDS Much photographic work was done throughout the year for other departments of the Council, the Libraries and Housing Departments particularly availing themselves of this service. Copies of valuable old prints, original water colours, etc., were made for library purposes and pictorial records of the Council's housing schemes were kept up-to-date. V.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION HOUSING. During the year 1950 no insanitary areas have been reported or declared by the Council, but Demolition Orders under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, have been made on 12 unfit houses, and Closing Orders under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, have been made on 6 parts of houses, involving altogether the displacement of 62 persons. A block of 29 flats was completed at St. John's Estate, 11 flats at Lockyer Estate, 12 flats at Adams Gardens Estate, and 8 flats at Arnold Estate. Accommodation for 168 families was provided during 1950 in properties controlled by this Council; 250 exchanges or transfers were arranged providing improved accommodation for tenants, and a further 331 Bermondsey families were accommodated by the London County Council during the year. 166 families were recommended to the L.C.C. on grounds of overcrowding.

The Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 234, requires the Borough Council to provide a proper place for the reception of dead bodies before interment. The Regional Hospital Board acts as agent for the Borough Council in this matter and receives into the mortuary at St. Olave's Hospital those bodies for which it is the duty of the Borough Council to provide. A fee of one guinea per body is paid by the Borough Council for this service. Number of infectious bodies removed Nil Total number of bodies removed 12 BURIAL OF THE DEAD It is the duty of the Borough Council under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in the Borough in any case where no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. The number of burials of such bodies arranged during the year was 4. STREET AND OPEN MARKETS Number of licences in operation during 1950: — Street markets 120 Open markets 395 Total 515 Income for 1950:— £ s. d. Street markets 1,221 2 0 Open markets 4,200 12 0 Total £5,421 14 0 I reported in my Annual Report for last year that the Southwark Park Road street traders had moved from the open market sites provided for them, back into the roadway, and had lodged an appeal with the Secretary of State against the refusal of the Council to designate Southwark Park Road as a street for the purpose of street trading under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947. I have now to report that the Secretary of State decided that owing to lapse of time they had no right of appeal, and that he refused to allow their appeal. Application was subsequently made to the High Court for an Order of Mandamus; this was heard on the 24th April, 1950, and dismissed with costs to the Council. The traders then returned to the open market sites, whereupon 159 summonses which had been served on them for trading in the street without licences were withdrawn on payment of £10 10s. 0d. costs. During the year there were 212 successful prosecutions against unlicensed traders, all "barrow boys" trading in the London Bridge area. Fines totalling £221 12s. 6d. were imposed, with costs amounting to £91 195. 0d. One summons was dismissed, the defendant being found "Not Guilty." The open market space which has been provided by the Council on the site of the former Bermondsey Abbey has become popularly Known as the New Caledonian Market. The first market was held on Friday, the 13th March, 1950, and a weekly market has been held on each Friday subsequently. During the Festival of Britain, it is proposed to have markets on Tuesdays as well as Fridays. A large number of these traders formerly had stalls "on the stones" of the Caledonian Cattle Market in Islington. The closing of that market, rather fortunately it seems for us, coincided with the provision of the new market. Many of these stall-holders have long-established reputations as dealers in antiques and sell high quality goods of value, and their presence here has attracted numerous visitors from abroad.

CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS In July of this year the Council appointed a Food Inspector to make a survey of all the catering establishments in the borough with particular reference to the encouragement of clean handling of food by means of propaganda and, where necessary, by the application of the legislation governing food premises.

The premises were totally unsuitable for the purpose and had been packed so tightly with the bags that doors were opened with difficulty, and when the door was opened, the grain spilled out on the ground. There was no proper room for inspection or ventilation, and in the case of one of the sheds, the roof was right open to the sky, and some grain bags were actually stored in the open with grain scattered all over the ground, sprouting in places. In one of the warehouses the smell of mice was noticeable; in another one, loose grain lying on the ground exhibited rat droppings in considerable numbers. A "stop" was placed on the grain which was eventually disposed of for animal feeding purposes. Silver Balls.— "Silver balls" commonly used for cake decorations are ordinarily coated with silver. A sample taken during the year disclosed the fact that the coating was of powdered aluminium and not of silver. The coating on each ball contained, on the average, 0.31 milligrammes of aluminium; the aluminium coating is not nearly so attractive in appearance as silver coating and as the object of the coating is solely decoration it does not appear to be likely that aluminium will soon replace silver though, of course, it is cheaper. Shelled Walnuts. — In September, a consignment of shelled walnuts from Italy, consisting of 60 cases, was received at Butler's Mill. These walnuts were alive with moth and had been stored in such conditions that the metamorphosis of the moth had been completed— that is, the egg had been laid in the walnut flower, hatched into maggot, and transformed into chrysalis from which the moth had emerged. The consignment was valued at more than £300, and efforts were made to save as much as possible. The nuts were fumigated and then screened to get rid of dead moth, powdered walnuts, and other residue. The remainder was then hand brushed and hand picked, and repacked into 86 new cartons with greaseproof paper linings, each carton containing 30 lbs. Butler's Mill were successful in cleaning these nuts and, after very careful examination, the remainder were considered to be fit for human consumption and were released. Eggs.— On 3rd October a letter was received from the Port Area Egg Officer proposing to move eggs in cold stores to their depot in Bermondsey and to two addresses in other boroughs to be sorted, the sound eggs to be broken out and sold as liquid egg. He asked that the marking required under the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act, 1928, be waived in respect of these eggs. Whilst agreeing to their request regarding the Ministry's depot in Bermondsey, I replied that I would not agree to any eggs going outside the control of this Department. The Ministry were holding 4,672 cases of duck and hen eggs at Cotton's Wharf Cold Stores. These were transferred to their warehouse in Battle Bridge Lane and between October and December were sorted under the supervision of the Food Inspector, the sound liquid being transferred to tins for use by bakers and the unsound eggs destroyed. Italian Canned Tomatoes. — In early October a shipment of canned tomatoes arrived at Symon's Wharf from Italy. Included were 600 cases (48 x13-oz. tins) which appeared to be "blown," all tins having at least one end bulging; these cases were therefore detained under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations. An interesting discovery was that these tins were originally intended for American light beers, hence the shaped ends. In addition many tins were rusty with stained labels. The importers appealed against the detention of the goods, but as many tins were found to be " blown " at both ends it was considered impossible to sort any sound from unsound and the importers were advised to re-export the cases to Italy. Subsequently the Commercial Attache of the Italian Embassy called and inspected the tins and advised their return to Italy. UNSOUND FOOD. The general inspection of food in shops and on stalls forms part of the duty of the District Sanitary Inspectors. Food, in the quantities stated, came under the notice of the Inspectors during the year, and being found unfit for human consumption was destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human food.

Sixty-four premises were entered on the Council's list for the year under report. As a result of samples being purchased, it was found that six contraventions of the Act occurred, poisons being sold wrongly by unlisted vendors. Warnings were given in all cases. MILK PREMISES. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938. MILK AND DAIRIES ORDER, 1926. Thirteen milk sellers were registered under the above Acts during 1950, and 8 were removed from the Register. There were 109 milk sellers on the Register at the end of the year. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED) REGULATIONS, 1949.

To sell Pasteurised Milk 17 To sell Tuberculin Tested Milk 16 To sell Sterilised Milk 19 All premises used for the sale of milk are regularly inspected to ensure that the standard of cleanliness laid down is maintained. MILK SAMPLING. Samples of milk, both for bacteriological and chemical examination, are taken from milksellers, and special arrangements are made for the sampling of the milk supplied to all schools in the borough. The total number of samples submitted for analysis during 1950 was 731, of which number 103 were taken from schools. For Chemical (i.e., Fat and non-Fatty Solids) Analysis.
