The main vital statistics are set out in the following pages, and need little comment, as there is comparatively little variation from the previous year, The expected increase in the number of measles cases was experienced 1,078 as against 327 in the previous year and there were no deaths from this disease or from whooping cough. Once again no case of diphtheria was notified in this district there has been no case since 1946. This is surely a tribute to the success of the immunisation scheme which is accepted so readily by the majority of parents. In this scheme, protection against diphtheria is still regarded as of paramount importance. although the other diseases against which protection is offered poliomyelitis, whooping cough, tetanus and smallpox are also of considerable significance. As yet a vaccine combining protective agents against all these diseases except smallpox has not been produced, but work towards this end is being pursued in many parts of the world. The best that has been done in this country so far is a triple substance to protect against diphtheria whooping cough and tetanus so that in the majority of cases, an infant still needs quite a formidable series of injections, as well as vaccination against smallpox in order to be thoroughly protected. It is, therefore most gratifying to find how readily protection for their children is accepted by the majority of parents and the results are seen in the infectious diseases incidence figures. In the only and fatal poliomyelitis case, the presence of the infection was discovered post mortem, the actual cause of death being a heart condition. There were three cases of typhoid fever in the district all in the same family. Despite many weeks of careful investigation and the following up of all possible sources, it is still not possible to say with certainty where this infection came from. There was no case of smallpox but again I feel it necessary to repeat what I have said on previous occasions. This district is quite near a major airport through which pass passengers and crews who, a few hours previously may have been in endemic or epidemic smallpox areas. Despite all airport medical control sooner or later a smallpox case or a person incubating smallpox - will arrive in the community and the subsequent sequence of events can well be imagined. The only safeguard is efficient vaccination and re-vaccination and primary vaccination is most easily and most safely carried out in infancy or early childhood. 2 There was an increase in the infant death rate, but this rate was still well below the national figure. The causes of these infant deaths are set out in full in the report from which it will be seen that the majority are due to conditions the causes of which are not yet fully understood. These same causes are also involved in many cases of still births and as a result the conditions causing death either just before or soon after birth are now being very actively studied in attempt to find means of cutting down this perinatal mortality This is an extremely difficult field in which to find positive information as genetic, nutritional and infective processes are all involved. Home accidents are a major cause of disability and even of death especially in the very young and the very old. This truism is being realised more and more as time goes on and especially as the ravages of infectious diseases are no longer such a serious problem and no longer are the major causes of disability and death. At last there are signs that manufacturers are alive to this problem and are beginning to put non inflammable fabrics on the market. By law they are now compelled adequately to protect heating appliances but the many troubles with oil heaters show how serious this safety problem is. The work of the Public Health Inspectors went on during the year in the usual unspectacular though none the less efficient manner. In this respect, it is with pleasure that I pay tribute to Mr E. H. Jenkins the Chief Public Health Inspector and the remainder of the staff of the Department for their loyal and most co-operative work The volume of the work done will be seen from the record set out in the body of the report. There were during the year three prosecuticns (i) Smoking in a butcher's shop - a fine of £3. plus one guinea costs being imposed, (ii) Nail in a loaf of bread a fine of £5, plus four guineas costs being imposed and (iii) Unsound meat purchased from a vending machine a fine of £20. plus three guineas costs being imposed. However, although in cases like these the law must be enforced most emphasis is placed on the educative side of the work and this approach is used whenever possible. The Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee have made the task of the Department much easier than it might otherwise have been and I have much pleasure in expressing my thanks to them for their great interest co-operation and very ready help„ I am Your obedient Servant, O.C. Dobson. Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS TOTAL AREA OP DISTRICT 6,583 acres.
