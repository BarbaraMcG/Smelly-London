LIBRARY AC 4376 CAM 36 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF CAMBERWELL ANNUAL (ABRIDGED) REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH H. W. BARNES, M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H for the year 1947 CAM 36 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Camberwell, S.E. 5. June 1948. The Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Mr, Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, My Annual Report for the year 1947 conforms to the directions contained in Ministry of Health Circular No.170/47 dated 31st December 1947 and follows the lines of the reports for the years 1939/46. The statistical information for 1947 provided by the Registrar General indicates an increase in the population of nearly 11,000 more than the previous year -175,060 as compared with 164,330. There were also 430 more births in 1947 - a total of 4,273 live births representing a birth rate of 24.4 - the highest since 1920. Other vital statistics varied only very slightly as follows:- 1946. 1947. Death rate 13.5 13.3 Infantile Mortality rate 38 39 Maternal Mortality rate 1.2 1.1 Tuberculosis death rate 0.6 0.7 Some concern was occasioned during the summer and autumn by the occurrence of several cases of infantile paralysis and in November 1947 I furnished a report on this matter to the Public Health Committee. There were 56 cases of this disease notified to this Department during the year, but in 22 instances the patients were subsequently found not to be suffering from poliomyelitis; there were three deaths. Diphtheria Prevention propaganda was continued during 1947 with considerable success, and towards the end of the year it became necessary to establish an additional clinic at the Amott Road Infant We If are Centre. For some considerable time efforts had been made by the Council to secure improved accommodation for the Dulwich Infant Welfare Centre and on the 2nd September this service was transferred from 114, Lordship Lane to the Dulwich Grove Congregational Church Community Centre, Tell Grove, S.E. 22, where more adequate accommodation had been rented from the Church Authorities. In the Nunhond area the St. Antholin's Infant Welfare Centre was conducted in temporary accommodation at 22, Linden Grove pending the reinstatement and repair of Barforth Hall, Barforth Road, which was used as a First Aid Post during the War. The necessary work was completed and on the 19th May the Infant Welfare Centroe returned to Barforth Hall. In order that this Authority might complete the Rodent Control Block Area Treatment Scheme representations were made to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for an extension to the 30th September 1947 of the grant aid under Circular N.5.12. This was granted and subsequently extended, at the Council's request, to the 31st January 1943. A further extension to the 31st March 1943 was later granted by the Ministry in order to facilitate the submission of the Council's claim for the fiscal year 1947/48, Facilities for the early detection and diagnosis of tuberculosis were greatly improved during the year by the Installation of a fluoroscopic screening apparatus at the Council's Tuberculosis Dispensary, 23, Brunswick Park. Consideration was also given by the" Public Health Committee to the question of purchasing an X-ray plant for radiography, but in view of the unsatisfactory condition of the Dispensary premises, the need for structural alterations to meet the requirements of the service, the length of time that would inevitably elapse before the purchase and erection of the plant could be contemplated, and above all the position arising from the passing of the National Health Service Act, 1945, which provides for the transfer from local authority control of the Tuberculosis Dispensary Service, It was decided to continue the present arrangement with the London County Council for X-ray films to be taken at St. Giles' Hospital. At the same time negotiations were commenced for similar facilities to be provided at Dulwich and King's College Hospitals. At the latter hospital arrangements could be made for only a limited number of patients to be dealt with weekly and as the financial terms were considerably higher than those offered by the London County Council for similar services at Dulwich Hospital, it was decided hot to make uso of those facilities unless the number of patients rendered this course necessary. At Dulwich Hospital, however, arrangements wore put in hand for X-ray film's to be taken on similar lines to those at St. Giles' Hospital. I wish to record once again my appreciation of tho co-operation I have received from Members of the Council, and to express my thanks to the staff of the Public Health Department for the assistance and loyal service they have rendered. In this connection, it is, perhaps, appropriate to draw attention to the amount of additional work that was required to be carried out during the year in the preparation of information and the completion of questionnaires relating to those functions which are to be transferred from the control of the Borough Council under the national Health Service Act, 1946. Yours faithfully, H. W. BARNES. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. SUMMARY OF STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1947.

SCABIES & VERMIN. The number of attendances at the Council's Cleansing Station for treatment for Scabies during the year showed a decrease of 50% below the figure for 1946, while the attendances for the treatment of verminous conditions showed only a very slight reduction. Follow-up visits were made by Sanitary inspectors and Health Visitors to the homes of the persons treated. Small tooth combs and Lethane Hair Oil were issued at the Council's Infant Welfare Centres.

The Diphtheria Prevention Campaign was most successful during the year as the result of propaganda and personal appeals to parents urging them to have their children protected against this disease; in fact, towards the end of the year the number of children awaiting treatment necessitated consideration being given to the establishment of an additional clinic and this was accordingly arranged at the Amott Road Infant Welfare Centre, the first session being held on 12th November. There are now four Diphtheria Immunisation sessions held weekly; two at the Sumner Infant Welfare Centre and one each at the Amott Road and Dulwich Infant Welfare Centres. The following is a summary of persons immunised during 1947:- 0 - 5 yrs. 5 - 15 yrs. Total. 1. At Borough Council Clinics etc. 1,209 2 1,211 2. At L.C.C. Schools and Clinics. 106 471 577 3. Under Private Practitioners Scheme. 89 8 97 Totals. 1,404 481 1,885 In addition to the above, 1,357 children received reinforcing injections. It will be seen that the number of children immunised at Borough Council Clinics is loss than during 1946. This is due to a now method of treatment which was introduced at two of the clinics whereby only one immunising injection is administered and a post-Schiek test carried out after an interval of six or twelve months; such cases have not boon included as "completed treatment" pending the result of the post-Schick test and consequently there were, at the end of the year, 982 cases still undergoing treatment. The following table shows the number of children in the Borough who had completed a full course of immunisation treatment up to 31st December 1947, together with the estimated mid-1947 child population.

Camberwell suffered relatively slightly when one takes into consideration the seasonal prevalence of this disease in summer and autumn. Fifty-six notifications were received at the Public Health Department during the year, but in 22 cases the patients were subsequently considered not to be suffering from infantile paralysis. There were three deaths. It will be seen from the following table that the disease was not confined to any particular area of the Borough, and the cases were well distributed in relation to age groups.

There was no evidence of the disease being spread in Camberwell by water from the swimming pools, the prevalence of flies or the existence of insanitary conditions. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE.

No complaints were made to the Public Health Department as to the purity of the water supply provided by the Metropolitan Water Board. -All houses in Camberwell receive their water supply from this source. WELLS. At the request of the Ministry of Health a survey of the position relating to private wells in the Borough was carried out during the year. So far as is known there are 39 private wells in Camberwell classified as follows:- Shallow wells. Deep wells. In use. Not in use. In use. Not in use. 1 12 *7 19 *One well temporarily out of use duo to defects in the pumping apparatus. With regard to the 8 wells in use, water is drawn from them for industrial purposes only, although in the case of the shallow well the water is occasionally used for drinking by the workman employed at the firm notwithstanding a warning given that he should not do so. The results of the examination of samples of water obtained from each of these wells for bacteriological and chemical analysis indicated that in three instances the water was suitable for drinking purposes. Of the 12 shallow wells not in use, nine appeared to have been effectively sealed, and in the case of the deep wells there were only three which had not been effectively sealed. Copies of the Bacteriologist's and Analyst's reports on the samples of water submitted for examination were forwarded to the Ministry of Health and to the management of the firms concerned. RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Scheme which was intensified in accordance with Ministry of Food Circular N.S. 12 continued during the year and an extension of the grant arrangements was sought by the Council, and authorised by the Ministry, to enable the Block Area Treatment programme to be completed. The following table gives an outline of the work carried out during 1947 under this Scheme.
