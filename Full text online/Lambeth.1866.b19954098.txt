Flushing and Cleansing have been carried out as before, and the sewers, both covered and open, are in a fair state of cleanliness. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects have been promptly examined, and remedied as possible, where the duty of doing so, has been with the Vestry. The House Drainage has been somewhat more than last year, from the circumstance of several New Sewers having been constructed. The applications for house drainage were for 964 houses, upon which about £1,985 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by applicants is £2,300, which has been executed under the inspection, and general super vision of the Officers of the Vestry. New Buildings. The Vestry have received notices for building 1,078 new houses, the drainage of which, and the level 6 of the lowest floors in relation to the Sewers, have been consider© and approved as directed by the Act. Sixty-four applications made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for leave to bring out, and alter frontages, have been referred to the Vestry; and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board of Works, has been given for the formation of 19 New Streets. 7 STATEMENT OF NEW WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS Carried out under the direction of the General Purposes Committee during the year ending the 25th March, 18G7.

In the past year, 61 memorials and applications have been received for improved lighting in various parts of the Parish; 46 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new lamps or removals, and 15 were refused. There have been 71 new lamps erected, and 29 removed to positions, which increased their utility. The total number of public lamps lighted by tho Vestry, is 2506; and the cost of lighting for the year ending the 25th March, 18G7, including the erection of new columns, removals, and other expenses, amounts to £10,956. 2s. 6d. A reduction of 5s. per lamp per annum has been made by the Phoenix Gas Company, in the price which they have charged for the Inner Wards of the Parish. The Chemical Examiner has made frequent periodical experiments with the Photometer, and his monthly reports have shewn that the illuminating power and purity of the gas supplied by the several Companies, have been up to the Standard which they are bound to supply; although, in the case of the Phoenix Gas from the works at Bankside, also that of the Crystal Palace Gas Company, ammonia in small quantities is always found to be present, as will be seen by the following tabular statement furnished by the Examiner:— 11 Result of 123 examinations of the Gas supplied to the Parish, consisting of 1220 observations during the year 1866:- GAS COMPANY.

December, 1867. ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1866-67, By GEORGE PUCKLE, M.D. Gentlemen, In presenting an Annual Report, in compliance with the 43rd section of "The Metropolis Management Amendment Act," it naturally divides itself into two parts : the one relating to the Health and Mortality of the districts comprising the Parish, the other to the Removal of Nuisances, and Sanitary Improvements carried out. During the year 1866, the births registered were more numerous than ever before recorded, amounting to 7,083, exceeding those in 1865 by 231, and those in 1864 by 644. The births in the first quarter of the year were 1,800; in the second quarter 1,796; in the third quarter 1,718; and in the fourth quarter 1,769. The deaths recorded in 1866 were 4,169, exceeding those in 1865 by 60, but 76 less than in 1864. In the first quarter of the year the deaths were 1,122; in the second quarter 978; in the third quarter 1,029; and in the last quarter 1,040. The births and deaths during each quarter of the year, in each of the Eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish, are shown in Table II. In the Waterloo Road, 1st part district, there were 13 561 births, and 343 deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part, District, 909 births, and 456 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 1st part, District, 791 births, and 499 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part, District, 1,449 births, and 1,100 deaths, 380 of which occurred In the Workhouse; in the Kennington, 1st part, District, 1,369 births, and 772 deathsin the Kennington 2nd part, District 742 births, and 414 deaths; in the Brixton District, 884 births, and 419 deaths; and in the Norwood District, 378 births, and 166 deaths—13 of which occurred in the Children's Workhouse. The- death rate of the Parish for 1866 corresponded almost exactly with that of the previous year, and was considerably below the death-rate of the whole metropolis; it also occupied a favourable position amongst the Parishes comprising the South District of London, which, with the exception of the West District, was the mast healthy during 1866. The comparative Mortality of Lambeth, the entire metropolis, and the South District, of which Lambeth forms a part, is shown in Table III., which gives the estimated increased population as well of each of the Divisions of the Parish, upon which the death-rate of each is calculated; from which it will be seen that the most healthy districts of the Parish, during 1866, were the Norwood, Brixton, and kennington, 2nd part; the Mortality being 168 per 10,000 of the estimated population in Norwood; 179 in Brixton; 194 in Kennington, 2nd part; 216 in Waterloo Road, 1st part; 224 in Kenington, 1st part; 242 in Waterloo Road, 2nd part; 242 in Lambeth Church, 1st part; 354 in Lambeth Church, 2nd part district; the <death-rate in Lambeth Church, 2nd part district, being the highest in consequence of the Adult Workhouse being situated there; the average number of inmates during the year were 997, and the deaths in it 380; excluding the Workhouse the death-rate of the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district, would be 240 instead of 354 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the Norwood 14 district the Children's Workhouse is situated; there were 13 deaths in the establishment, which contained an average of 430 children during the year; excluding the Workhouse, the deathrate of the Norwood district would bo only 162 per 10,000 persons. Epidemic Diseases (Table IV.) caused 885 deaths, being in the proportion of nearly 21¼ per cent. of the entire mortality. In the previous year Epidemic diseases caused 21¼ per cent., and in 1864, 23½ per cent. of the entire mortality; so that, including the presence of Cholera, the death rate from Epidemic Diseases in 1866, diminished. Diarrhoea caused 180 deaths, Fever 159, Whooping Cough 139, Measles 131, Cholera 114, Scarlatina 78, Small Pox 58, and Diptheria 26 deaths. The year was remarkable for the sudden and violent outbreak of Cholera in the East District of London, where 3931 deaths occurred from it, being in the proportion of 64½ per 10,000 of the estimated population. Early measures, in anticipation of it, were adopted in Lambeth; 10,000 notices and handbills were posted or distributed, advising inhabitants respecting the precautions they should use. Ten Medical Officers were appointed at the beginning of August to supply Medicines and Attendance instantly, free of charge; an extra Medical Visitor was also employed for a short time in the district most affected; tho number of cases treated by them are shown in Table V; they amounted to 332 cases of Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea, and 3,269 cases of Diarrhoea in August, with 16 deaths; 105 cases of Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea, and 1,306 of Diarrhoea in September, with 12 deaths ; and 123 of Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea, and 844 of Diarrhoea in October, with 27 deaths. A daily report was furnished by each Medical Officer to the Medical Officer of Health, giving an account of every fresh case of Cholera occurring in their districts, which, together with a daily return of deaths kindly supplied by the Registrar General, proved of the greatest service in enabling 15 the Medical Officer of Health to provide for prompt examination in every case of Cholera by Dr. Barraclough, appointed for the time to assist him, and who visited the cases of Cholera to see the Disinfectants freely supplied, viz:-McDougall's Disinfecting Powder, Smith's Disinfecting Powder, and Carbolic Acid were properly used; examining articles of bedding or clothing, which, if infected with Cholera discharges, were ordered to be taken away and burnt, new articles being usually supplied in their place; and, in the event of death, causing the immediate removal of the corpse to the Dead-house previous to interment, which was accomplished in almost every instance. The cleansing and limewhiting rooms, and removal of nuisances were promptly attended to, and the Inspectors of Nuisances removed and burnt the soiled bedding. A considerable number of cases might be traced to infection, and arose either in the same house in which other cases occurred, or the disease was contracted in nursing persons suffering from it. In several instances Cholera appeared to be imported into the Parish from other localities. In two fatal cases it was said to have arisen after eating stale crab, and in one after eating decomposed meat. An outbreak occurred in the Workhouse in No. 19 Ward, in the beginning of November. No case of Cholera had been admitted into the house for more than a fortnight previously, or any case into that part where the outbreak occurred. The Ward which was not a Sick Ward was clean, but at the time overcrowded, its cubical capacity being 6,725 feet, it contained 17 persons, of whom 2 were children, when Cholera broke out in it. Between the 3rd and 5th of November, five out of the seventeen inmates were attacked and died. The disease was supposed to have been introduced by a person described as a hawker, without any home, who appeared unwell when she was admitted on the 31st October, but did not apply for medical advice. She died on the 4th November, after 12 hours decide 16 illness from Cholera. No case occurred in Lambeth which could be ascribed to partaking of impure water. The Registrar General in a Report on the 10th December, remarks—" A most gratifying and conclusive proof of the good effects of improved water supply is afforded by the experience of the South London Districts, which were undrained, and were supplied with the foul sewage water of the Thames by the Southwark and Lambeth Companies in 1849. The Lambeth Company got purer water from the Thames above Teddington Lock before 1854, but the South wark Company only succeeded in supplying the purer water after the year 1854. In the present year, both Companies have supplied this better, if not perfectly pure, water of the Thames; while the shallow pumps have been dried up by the drains,—with the following remarkable results:—the deaths by Cholera to 10,000 inhabitants of South London, were 120 in the year 1849, 87 in 1854, and 8 in tho year 1866. From Cholera and Diarrhoea the deaths out of tho same numbers living were 142, and 104, and 15! As tho water improved the deaths declined to this marvellous extent." I believe the great Sanitary improvements effected in tho Parish in providing proper drainage, instead of foul cesspools, abolishing many miles of open stinking ditches, and the removal of numerous other nuisances, rendered an outbreak of Cholera, such as experienced in former years, very improbable. Moreover, the Sanitary arrangements provided for tho immediate treatment of Diarrhoea, very frequently preceding Cholera, which if attended to in that stage, is almost always curable; and, also for the immediate application of Disinfectants to the Cholera discharges, which is of the greatest importance, in preventing the spread of Cholera. By the employment of such means, Lambeth and other parts of the Metropolis were saved from the ravages of the Pestilence experienced on former occasions. The virulence and fatality of the disease being not at all diminished in Continental Cities, where in 22 Cities and Towns of Belgium and Holland, 17 containing less then half the population of London, the deaths from Cholera alone during the year were 20,643. If the same rate of mortality had prevailed in London, instead of 5,577, the deaths would have exceeded forty-two thousand. In Brussels the deaths were in the proportion of 164, Utrecht 271, and Amsterdam 42, in 10,000 inhabitants. In London 18, aud in Lambeth only 6, in 10,000 inhabitants died. In Table VI, will be found the deaths from Cholera in each of the eight divisions of the Parish in each week of the Epidemic, from which it will be seen that the greatest number of deaths occured in the weeks ending the 18th August, and 6th and 13th October. The Disease was most fatal in the two lowest lying districts of the Parish, viz: the Lambeth Church, 1st and 2nd part districts, 28 deaths taking place in the former, and 46 in the latter, containing the Workhouse; 13 occurred in the Kennington 1st part, and 5 in the Kennington 2nd part districts, 4 in the Waterloo Road 1st part, and 9 in the 2nd part, 6 in the Brixton, and 3 in the Norwood district A comparison of Mortality from Cholera in Lambeth in each of the epidemics which have occurred is shown in Table VII., which gives the population of the Parish in each period, the number of deaths from cholera, and the death rate per 10,000 inhabitants. In the first epidemic in 1832 the population of Lambeth was 88,856, the deaths from Cholera 337, death-rate 38 per 10,000 inhabitant. In the second epidemic in 1849, the population Avas 134,768, the deaths from cholera 1,618, death-rate 120 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the third epidemic in 1854, the population was 146,138, the deaths from cholera 941, death-rate 64 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the recent epidemic the population was 175,084, the deaths from cholera 114, death-rate only 6 per 10,000 inhabitants. In Table I. is shown the number and nature of Nuisanccs brought under the notice of the General Purposes and Sanitary C 18 Committees, with the results and Sanitary Improvements effected. The amount of Sanitary work carried out between the 25th of March, 1866, and the 25th of March, 1867, was unusually large in consequence of additional Inspectors of Nuisances having been employed. The permanent staff was increased from two to three inspectors, in addition to which two extra inspectors were employed for rather more than three months to assist in Houseto-house Inspection, and for a fortnight a third was engaged, their services being discontinued early in January. The number of Nuisances removed or abated, and Sanitary Improvements effected, amounted to 7940; comprising 1509 unwholesome houses, cleansed or white-washed; 684 dilapidated houses repaired; 625 houses provided with means of ventilation; 768 new ash-pits or dust-bins erected; 606 houses provided with proper drainage; 428 cesspools emptied or abolished; 253 premises supplied with water; 454 water receptacles improved ; 410 drain obstructions removed; 353 privies, closets, and drains improved; 211 yards cleansed, repaved, or otherwise improved; 716 accumulations of dust, dung, or garbage removed ; 66 lots of swine, consisting of 440 pigs removed; 88 offensive smells from trades, &c., abated; 78 gullies attended to; 14 foul urinals cleansed; 7 dangerous structures removed ; 7 lots of unsound and unwholesome food seized and conveyed to the Police Courts, and afterwards destroyed by the Magistrates' order; 156 articles of clothing, beds and bedding, infected with cholera discharges burnt; and 115 slaughter-houses, 105 cow-houses, and 225 bakehouses white-washed several times. Before the completion of the above works, several visits were usually required by the Inspectors, 3094 Notices were served, and 28 Summonses heard at the Southwark and Lambeth Police Courts. Three new applications for Licenses for Slaughter-houses were opposed at the Newington Sessions and refused. Three new Licenses for Cow-houses were granced, two of which were in lieu of old licenses discontinued. 19 In conclusion, I would desire to express my appreciation of the efficient services rendered by Dr. Barraclough and the Inspectors of Nuisances during a perilous period, and of the zealous manner in which they performed their arduous duties. I remain, Your very faithful servant, GEORGE PUCKLE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
