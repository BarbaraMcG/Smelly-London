The Council at its Meeting on the 18th October, 1911, resolved unanimously:— Address to the Mayor. "That the best thanks of the Council be presented to Alderman Archibald Davis Dawnay, J.P., for his able, courteous, and impartial conduct in the Chair, and for the time and attention bestowed by him in the discharge of his duties as Mayor of this Borough for the third year in succession." 3. The General Purposes Committee were instructed to prepare and settle an Address expressing the Council's high appreciation of Alderman Dawnay's services. 4. The following Address was accordingly engrossed, framed, sealed with the Common Seal of the Council and presented to Alderman Dawnay at the Meeting of the Council on the 9th November:— 30 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. Population. Area. Rateable Value. 311,402. 9,199 acres. £2,155,122. To Alderman Archibald Davis Dawnay, J.P. We, the Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, hereby express our high appreciation of your valuable services as Mayor during the year November, 1910—November. 1911, being the third successive year in which you have served that Office. The past year has been memorable as being that of the Coronation of Their Majesties King George V. and Queen Mary. In connection therewith it was your duty and privilege to be in attendance on the 22nd June at Ihe Coronation in Westminster Abbey; and on the following day, in company with the nine other Mayors of South London Boroughs, to present to their Majesties a combined Loyal Address from those Boroughs on the occasion of the Royal Progress through I.ondon. We recall the arduous labours which you undertook in arranging for the Public Entertainments and Festivities given to 51,000 children in this Borough in celebration of Their Majesties' Coronation, at one of which, held in the grounds adjoining the Royal Hospital for Incurables at West Hill, Wandsworth, you had the distinguished honour of receiving Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, who gave to the children there assembled gracious messages from Their Majesties. These festivities were rendered particularly memorable by the specially struck Coronation Medals which you generously presented to the Council, to its Members, to the children and to man}' other inhabitants of the Borough. It is with great pleasure that we are able to congratulate you upon the success of your appeal for public subscriptions for the Borough of Wandsworth Memorial Statue to His late Majesty King Edward VII., which has been recently erected at Tooting Broadway. We must also allude to the enterprise shown by you in the establishment of the Inter-Borough Rifle Contest, which has had the effect of greatly stimulating the interest taken in Miniature Rifle Shooting, and has brought about most pleasant social relations between the residents in the several Boroughs in and near the Metropolis. The handsome Challenge Cup, generously provided by you, was appropriately won in the first year's contest by the Team from this Borough. In all the matters to which we have referred, and on the numerous other occasions when you have represented this Borough, you have most worthily upheld the dignity and importance of the high position to which you were unanimously re-elected by us a year ago, and we acknowledge with gratitude the very zealous and successful manner in which the heavy and important duties of your Office have been discharged, and the generous hospitalitv extended by you to all classes and to every part of the Borough. 31 We also record our heartiest thanks to the Mayoress for the kindly and gracious manner in which she has supported you in your many Social and Public Undertakings, and we trust that the events of the year and of your two preceding years of Office will ever remain in your memories a bright and interesting recollection.

Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Connaught attended the entertainment given to the children of the Fairfield and Southfield Wards in the grounds of the Royal Hospital for Incurables and the Leg of Mutton Field, Southfield, on Monday, the 26th June, and were received by the Mayor and Mayoress and the Town Clerk, Sir Henry Kimber, Bart., M.P., the Bishop of Southwark, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough, and members of the Hospital Board of Management. Their Royal Highnesses were very much interested in the entertainments and the singing of the children, and their visit was highly appreciated by the •children. Most of the other entertainments were visited by the Mayor and Mayoress and the Town Clerk. 25. The Mayor presented a Coronation Medal in a case to each Ward Committee for a prize for a race for boys, and sent handsome invitation cards to the children and helpers in the Clapham North Ward. The Mayor also gave a Coronation Medal to the top boy and a Coronation Brooch to the top girl in each class of the Public Elementary Schools, and Sir Henry Kimber gave Coronation Medals to infants. Many other prizes and gifts were kindly presented by ladies and gentlemen and associations who took an interest in the celebrations in the different Wards. 26. The respective Ward Committees made efficient arrangements for the entertainments, and they were carried out in a very satisfactory manner. The thanks of the Council were accorded to the Members of the Committees and other ladies and gentlemen, and especially to the teachers, for the great time given and trouble taken to make the entertainments a thorough success. 27.

The Council House, Town Hall, the several public libraries, the Rating and Registration Offices, the Borough Engineer's Offices, and the Tooting and Wandsworth Baths, were illuminated on the 22nd, 23rd, 26th, and 27th June; and many of the tradesmen and others kept up the decorations and illuminations which they had used on Coronation Day. 29. Subscriptions amounting to £737 8s. 5d. were received from residents towards the cost of the celebration, the total cost of which was £2,362 14s. 0d. 30. The following Parliamentary Bills were considered by the Council, viz.:— London County Council (General Powers). Metropolitan District Railway. Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas.

London County Council (Finance). Aliens. Disorderly Houses. Parliamentary Elections. Poor Law (London). Summer Season (Daylight Saving). L.C.C. (Gencral Powers.) 31. Part III. of this Bill proposed to authorize the London County Council to hold, lay out, and develop on the lines of a garden suburb part of the White Hart estate, Tottenham, and to let plots of land on lease for buildings other than for the accommodation of the working classes. This Council saw no objection to the London County Council disposing of part of the estate but was of opinion that such Council should not be empowered to build premises other than for the accommodation of the working classes on the estate. The Bjll rectived Royal Ascent on the 7th August, 1912. 37 Metropolitan District Railway Bill. 32. This Bill proposed to authorize the South Western Railway Company to widen the Wimbledon and Fulham Railway and works, and for that purpose to purchase certain premises in this Borough and to interfere with highways and rights and powers of the Council. A petition was presented against the Bill and clauses for the protection of this Borough having been agreed, the Council's opposition was withdrawn, and the Bill received the Royal Assent on the 7th August, 1912. Wandsworth, Wimbledon, and Epsom District Gas Bill. 33. The object of this Bill was to constitute as one undertaking the undertakings of the Wandsworth & Putney, the Mitcham & Wimbledon, and the Epsom & Ewell Gas Companies. With the exception of a few minor matters no new powers were sought. The total capital of the new company is the sum of the total capital of the three Companies. The Bill proposed to authorise the Company to exercise the powers conferred upon the Wandsworth Gas Co., in 1900, to stop up certain footpaths and thoroughfares in this Borough. The Bill also provided for the then standard price of gas to be continued. The Council presented a petition against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of clauses for the protection of this Borough. The Company afterwards agreed to insert clauses providing for penalties in respect of calorific tests in lieu of those for illuminating power, for the provision of a second testing place in the Wandsworth limit, and with respect to the relative prices of gas in the several limits, and other matters, whereupon the Council's opposition was withdrawn, and the Bill received Royal Assent on the 7th August. Music and Dancing. 34. This Bill was to the same effect as the Bill referred to in paragraph 44 of the Council's last Annual Report. The Council petitioned in favour thereof. The Bill was read a third time in the House of Lords and then dropped. Metropolitan Police Rate. 35. This Bill proposed to increase the maximum of the Police Rate from gd. to nd. in the £. The Council presented a petition against the Bill, which, however, received Royal Assent on the 29th March, 1912. 38 Daylight Saving Bill. 36. This Council presented a petition in favour of this Biil and also forwarded a copy of a resolution in favour thereof to His Majesty's Government and also to the leader of the Opposition. The Bill was not proceeded with. National Health Insurance. 37. The Council presented a petition against this Bill objecting to the creation of Local Health Committees as proposed, to the provisions relating to contributions of employers towards the insurance of workmen on the ground that such contributions should fall upon the State, to the provisions relating to voluntary contributions, and generally on the ground that the Bill was being pushed forward with undue haste. The Bill received Royal Assent on the 16th December, 1911. Parliamentary Franchise of Women. 38. The Council asked the Members of Parliament for this Borough to support facilities being afforded for the consideration of this Bill. Rag Flock. 39. The Council suggested two amendments to this Bill which, however, were not adopted, and the Bill received Royal Assent on the 16th December, 1911. Representation of the people. 40. This Bill was again introduced by Sir Henry Kimber, Bart., M.P., its object being to make the representation in the House of Commons more nearly proportionate to population. The Council petitioned in favour of the measure,, but the Bill did not reach the second reading. Shops Bill. 41. The Council presented a petition against this Bill on the ground that its provisions were an undue interference with trade. The Bill received Royal Assent on the 16th December, 1911. Aliens Prevention of Crime. 42 The Council presented a petition in favour of this Bill which was dropped. 43. No order was made with regard to the other Bills abovementioned. 39 Memorial to King Edward VII. 44. In continuation of our last Annual Report (page 36) we have to report that the Borough Memorial to His late Majesty King Edward VII., at Tooting Broadway, was unveiled by the Mayor on the 4th November, and the following is a copy of a telegram sent to the King on the occasion, and of His Majesty's reply; viz.:— "To His Gracious Majesty The King, Sandringham. "May it please your Majesty. We have this clay unveiled, at Tooting Broadway, in the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, a noble statue to His late Majesty King Edward VII. Your devoted subjects here humbly bid you and Her Majesty God speed on your visit to India, and a safe and happy return home. "The Mayor, Wandsworth." "To The Mayor, Wandsworth. "The King is much gratified to hear that you have to-day unveiled a statue to King Edward, which the people of Wandsworth have erectcd to his dear memory. His Majesty sincerely thanks you and those who join with you for the kind sentiments and good wishes to which your telegram gives expression. "C. Wigram." 45. The Memorial consists of a bronze statue of His late Majesty King Edward VII. in regal robes, seven feet six inches in height, standing upon a pedestal of polished red granite nine feet four inches in height. The pedestal bears the following inscription, viz.:— EDWARD VII. and on the lower plinth in front:— Erected by Public Subscription. 1911. Alderman Archibald Davis Dawnay, J.P., Mayor. The sculptor is Mr. Louis Fritz Roselieb, of Clapham. 46. Mounted and bound photographs of the Statue were forwarded to His Majesty King George V., and to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra. 47. The Committee who had the matter in hand expressed their entire satisfaction with the Memorial, and the subscriptions received were sufficient to meet the expenses. C 40 Royal Patriotic Asylum. 48. The Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation having proposed to dispose of about 20 acres of land adjoining the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum at Wandsworth Common, the Council, in view of the fact that the land formerly formed part of Wandsworth Common, strongly objected to its being used for any other purpose than an open space, and deputations from this Council and the Battersea Borough Council in support of this Council's views attended before the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the London County Council in support of the land in question being acquired and added to Wandsworth Common. 49. The Mayor convened a Towns Meeting at the Town Hall on the 28th October, when the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— "(1) This Meeting of the inhabitants of Wandsworth and Battersea deplores the Royal Patriotic Corporation's proposal to dispose (possibly for building purposes) of the 20 acres of land, known as 'The Farm,' formerly a part of Wandsworth Common, and held as 'a visible and permanent memorial of the national generosity.' "(2) This Meeting urges upon the London County Council and the Borough Councils of Wandsworth and Battersea the necessity of taking immediate and at the same time reasonable and equitable measures for the preservation of the land as an open space. "(3) That the Chairman of this Meeting (Alderman Archibald D. Dawnay, J.P., Mayor of Wandsworth), be authorised to sign and transmit copies of the above resolutions to the London County Council, the Wandsworth and Battersea Borough Councils, the President of the Local Government Board, and the local Members of Parliament; that a Deputation be appointed to wait upon the Royal Patriotic Corporation and present the Resolutions to them; and that the Deputation consist of the speakers this evening and the two honorary secretaries of the Wandsworth Common Protection Association. (4) That the Deputation appointed this evening be requested to take steps with the view of raising a Fund towards the acquisition of the land." 50. The estimated cost of purchasing the land was about £12,000 and this Council asked the London County Council to acquire the land for use as an open space, and agreed to contribute £3,000 towards the cost, provided that a similar sum was contributed by the Battersea Borough Council and public subscription. The County Council adopted the suggestion and the agreement with the London County Council for payment of this Council's contribution was sealed by the Council on the 20th January, 1912. 41 Metropolitan Borough's Standing Joint Committee. 51. A Standing Joint Committee of representatives of the Metropolitan City and Borough Councils having been formed to watch over and take steps for safeguarding the rights, authority, interests and duties of such Councils as they may bs affected by legislation or otherwise, and to confer and advise upon matters of common interest generally, the Mayor, Alderman Linclsey and the Town Clerk, were appointed this Council's representatives on such Committee. The Mayor was subsequently elected a member of the Executive Committee. National Reserve. S2. The Council decided to form a National Reserve Committee for this Borough, consisting of the Mayor, Aldermen Cresswell, Lindsey and Surgeon Major Robinson, I.M.D., Councillors Campbell, C.B., Cundall and Sir Frederick Lance, K.C.B, and Members of. the Wandsworth Military Committee, with such additional members as might be considered desirable. Town Clerk. 53. Mr. H. G. Hills, who had been Town Clerk of the Borough since the beginning of the Council, having resigned his appointment, the Council presented him with the following illuminated address, viz.:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. Area, 9,199 acres. Population in 1900 232,032. Population in 1912 311,482. Rateable Value £1,527,029. Rateable Value £2,124,213, To Henry George Hills, Esquire. We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, in regretfully accepting your resignation of the office of Town Clerk of this Borough, desire to place on record our great appreciation of your long and distinguished services, not only to this Borough since it was created in 1900, when you were unanimously appointed Town Clerk, but also of the Wandsworth District Board of Works, which preceded this Borough, and of which you were the Assistant Clerk for nine years, and also Clerk for nearly sixteen years. Some Members of the Council were members of the District Board, and from their testimony we are pleased to say that you discharged your duties of Clerk to that Board in a most efficient manner, and that it was under many and great obligations to you for the indefatigable assistance you rendered on the passing of the Act of Parliament for separating the Parish of Battersea from the other Territory of the Board. 42 It is with much pleasure we express how highly we value your able advice and guidance in settling the transfer of the officers of the District Board and the division of assets between the two Boards. Your services also to the New Borough when it was formed were of the greatest possible aid to the Council in making the numerous arrangements which became necessary under the provisions of the London Government Act of 1899, and more especially in effecting a uniformity of Rating and administration throughout this Borough, and in the amalgamation of the five ancient Parishes of Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth into one civil Parish; and from that time to the present you have continued to carry out your multifarious duties, official and social, in a most assiduous and genial manner, thereby not only winning the admiration of the Count il but of everyone whom you have had to meet in the pursuit of your offkial calling. The notable fact that you were elected Chairman of the Metropolitan Association of Town Clerks is a most valuable testimony to your great experience and ability, and proves how highly you were esteemed by that important body. We must also record that during your office two beloved Sovereigns passed away—Their late Majesties Queen Victoria and King Edward VII—and that you were instructed to prepare the Addresses to the Throne on their demise, and also on the occasion of the accession of His late Majesty King Edward VII and His present Majesty King Ceorge V; and that you represented this Borough, with the Mayor and other Members of the Council, at the presentation of the Addresses to Their Majesties. We also gratefully acknowledge the ungrudging and kind assistance rendered by you in connection with the festivities held in this Borough at the Coronation of both the Kings and Oueens. The Council expresses its sincere regret in losing your faithful and valuable services, and assures you that in your well-earned retirement you will take with you the highest esteem and respect not onlv of every member of the Council, but also of every ratepayer in this Borough, and we give expression to the earnest hope that Mrs. Hills and yourself will be spared with The Almighty's blessing for the peaceful enjoyment of many years to come. Sealed by Order, this 24th day of April, 1912. (Signed) ARCHIBALD D. DAWNAY, Mayor. (L.S.) (Signed) D. A. NICHOLL, Town Clerk. 54. To fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Mr. Hills, the Council, at its meeting on the 21st February, 1912, appointed Mr. David Arthur Nicholl, M.A., LL.M. (Carnb.), Town Clerk of Scarborough, Town Clerk of the Borough of Wandsworth. Metropolitan Paving Committee. 55. Alderman Hewett, J.P., has again been appointed as this Council's representative on the Metropolitan Paving Committee. Motor Omnibus Traffic. 56. A conference of Metropolitan, City and Borough Councils, on the subject of motor omnibus traffic in London, convened by the Hampstead Borough Council, was 43 held at Westminster City Hall on 6th February last, when Councillors Jackson and Plumridge, and the Town Clerk, attended as this Council's representatives, and resolutions were passed in favour of proprietors of mechanically-propelled vehicles in London being brought under contribution for the repair and upkeep of roads used by such vehicles, and of further measures being taken for the control of motor omnibus traffic. 57. The Borough Council has since urged the Government to introduce legislation establishing a Traffic Board for the regulation of vehicular traffic in London, and providing for the distribution of the proceeds of the petrol tax received from the County of London among the Metropolitan Borough Councils as a contribution towards the maintenance of highways Speed Limit for Motor Traffic. 58. At the suggestion of the Borough Council, theTondon County Council applied to the Local Government Board for a regulation to be made prescribing a maximum speed not exceeeling 10 miles an hour for motor vehicles on Putney Bridge and in High Street, Putney. The Borough Council supported the proposal at the Local Inquiry held by the Board recently, and the application has now been granted and the necessary order made by the Board. The usual notices have been fixed in the area affected. 59. Applications were also made by the London County Council to the Local Government Board for regulations to be made reducing the speed limit for motor traffic in the following thoroughfares in the Borough, viz.:— (a) Streatham High Road, from Pinfold Road to Stan- thorpe Road. (b) footing Bee Gardens, from Ambleside Avenue to Streatham High Road. (c) Clapham Common South Side, from Cavendish Road to Balham Hill. (d) Balham Hill, from Clapham Common to Balham High Road. (e) Balham High Road, from Balham Hill to Balham Park Road. (f) Upper Tooting Road, from Tooting Bee Road to Tooting High Street. (g) Tooting High Street, from Upper Tooting Road to Tooting Graveney School. 44 6o. After careful consideration of all the circumstances, the Borough Council came to the conclusion that it was not desirable that any reduction should be made in the speed limit in these thoroughfares; and the London County Council and Local Government Board were so informed. A Local Government Board Inquiry was held with regard to the Streatham High Road and Tooting Bee Gardens proposals, and after considering the report of their Inspector the Board decided not to comply with the application in those cases. Putney to Wandsworth. Tramways. 61. The construction of the tramways in the portion of this route between Putney Bridge and the junction of Putney Bridge Road with High Street, Wandsworth, has been completed. The line was inspected on behalf of the Board of Trade on 26th January, 1912, and was shortly afterwards opened for traffic. 62. The Borough Council has been in communication with the County Council with regard to additional widenings which are required in Putney Bridge Road and the County Council has promised to bear the suggestions in mind when favourable opportunities offer. 63. Steps are being taken by the London County Council for widening High Street, Wandsworth, so as to allow of the extension of the line along that thoroughfare to join up with the existing tramways in York Road. With the view of assisting the County Council to effect the improvement without delay the Borough Council agreed to give up the part of the forecourt of the Wandsworth Public Baths required to be added to the public way there. Arrangements have also been made for widening the bridge over the river Wandle, and this work will be begun shortly. 64. The Borough Council asked the London County Council to extend the widening at and near the corner of High Street, Putney, and Putney Bridge Road, so as to include the part of the road in front of Nos. 17, 19, 21 and 25, High Street, Putney, if the necessary property could be obtained at a reasonable cost. The County Council adopted the suggestion with regard to No. 25, High Street, Putney, and continued the widening in front of those 45 premises, tlie expenditure being covered by the estimate in respect of the general widening of Putney Bridge Road, towards the cost of which the Borough Council is contributing one-third. Cedars Road and Southcroft Road Woodpaving. 65. Under agreements between the Borough Council and the County Council, the periods within which the Borough Council was to pave with wood the carriageways (excluding the tramway tracks and margins) of parts of Cedars Road, Clapham, and Southcroft Road, Streatham, were extended by eighteen months in each case. East Hill Widening. 66. A widening of East Hill, between Fairfield Street and the Baptist Chapel, has been carried out by the London County Council, the Borough Council contributing one-third of the expense. The estimated cost was £2,360. High Street, Wandsworth and St. Ann's Hill Widening. 67. In accordance with the terms of the agreement between the Borough Council and the County Council referred to in a previous report, the County Council gave up the strip of the site of the Old Vicarage, in high street, wandsworth, required for widening the public way there to 54 feet, and the Borough Council continued the widening to the foot of St. Ann's Hill. At the time when the agreement was entered into the County Council proposed to erect a new technical institute at the junction of High Street, Wandsworth, and St. Ann's Hill. The Borough Council has on many occasions urged upon the County Council the desirability of the scheme being proceeded with, and on 12th June, 1912, a deputation, consisting of the Mayor, Aldermen Cresswell and Penfold, Councillors Bulstrode, Denny, Harding, and Plumridge, attended before the Higher Education Sub-Committee of the County Council in support of the proposal. The matter is still under the consideration of the County Council. York Road Widening. 68. The widening of York Road, Wandsworth, by the Borough Council is now almost complete. The Council has, however, been unable to agree reasonable terms for certain outstanding interests, and steps are being taken for their compulsory purchase under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act. 46 Bridge over Hailway, High Street, Putney. 69. The London and South-Western Railway Company having stated their intention to reconstruct at an early date a section of the bridge carrying High Street, Putney, over the railway, a scheme has been prepared by the Company's Engineer in collaboration with the Engineer to the Metropolitan Water Board and the Borough Engineer for widening the bridge and for placing the Water Board's mains under the public way in lieu of their being carried alongside the bridge as at present. The Borough Council is now in communication with the Road Board, the London County Council, and the Railway Company with the view of those bodies contributing towards the cost of the proposed works. Upper Richmond Road Improvement. 70. The Barnes Urban District Council and the London County Council having considered the Borough Council's suggestion as to the improvement of Upper Rich- mond road, putney, at the County boundary near Priests' Bridge, agreed to support an application to the Road Board in favour of the scheme, but were not prepared to make any contribution towards the cost. As these authorities declined to give the proposal their financial support, the Borough Council did not feel justified in proceeding further with the matter. 71. The part of Upper Richmond Road, between Priory Lane and the County boundary at Priests' Bridge, has since been paved with the following materials as an experiment, viz.:—(a) Cormastik road material; (b) Durax armouring, part Enderby and part Norway granite; and (c) granite macadam with Plascom binding material. Putney Heath Widening 72. With the consent of the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators, the Council has effected an improvement by rounding off the corner of Putney Heath at the junction of the southern side of Putney Heath North with the eastern side of the road leading from Putney Park Lane to the Old Portsmouth Road. Mitcham Road "Widening. 73. The surplus land at Xos. 22 to 38, Mitcham Road, Tooting, acquired in connection with the widening of the public way there, has been sold by the Borough -47 Council for £2,100. The remaining piece of surplus land forming pait of the site of No. 42, Mitcham Road, at the junction of Salvador, is still in hand. Church Lane- 74. An arrangement has been made with the London County Council for a rectification of the line of Church Lane, Tooting, where that road abuts upon Tooting Common. The Borough Council was also able to secure the addition to the public way of a small strip of Tooting Common at the eastern corner of Mantilla Road. Tooting Bec Boad Widening. 75. In connection with the formation of new roads (Montana Road and Avoca Road), on the Elmwood House Estate, Balham, and the erection of houses there, arrangements were made for parts of Tooting Bee Road upon which the estate abuts to be widened to not less than 54 feet. The estimated cost of the improvement (including the paving works, but excluding pipe alterations) is £1,450, and after considerable correspondence the London County Council agreed to carry out the widening subject to the Borough Council contributing one-third of the expense. This condition was accepted by the Borough Council, provided its contribution did not exceed £483. Tooting Bec Gardens Widening. 76. The widening of Tooting Bee Gardens, Streatham, at the Woodlands Estate, has now been carried out. The Borough Council was also able to arrange for the widening of this road at the junction of Mitcham Lane in connection with the erection of an addition to the Electric Supply Company's transformer station there. The London County Council is contributing one-half the net cost of this further widening. Streatham High Road. 77. For several years past the Borough Council has been pressing the London County Council for consent to form a footpath at the side of Streatham Common adjoining Streatham High Road and to round off the corners of the Common at the junction of that road with Streatham Common North and Streatham Common South. The approval of the County Council to these works has now been obtained. The scheme provides for the formation of a tar-dressed footpath with granite kerb, alongside the carriageway in Streatham High Road, the estimated cost being £265. 48 78. In connection with the rebuilding of the Police Station at the corner of Streatham High Road and Shrubbery Road, the London County Council arranged for the main road to be widened to 60 feet, the Borough Council contributing one-third of the net cost of the improvement, which was estimated at £300. 79. By agreement with the owners of the Crooke Ellison Estate, land on both sides of Greyhound Lane, Streatham, was required to be given up for the purpose of widening that road. In pursuance of this agreement a strip of land on the north-western side of the Lane was added to the public way after being levelled and covered with ashes, spur stones being placed alongside the carriageway where necessary. The Borough Council also took possession of a piece of land on the south-eastern side of the road, and fixed spur stones on the new boundary at the back of the hedge and bank, which it is proposed should remain for the present. This hedge and bank can be removed and the land levelled at any time the Council thinks fit. Greyhound Lane Widening. 80. The following works, upon which unemployed workmen Unemployment, were engaged, were carried out in conjunction with the Central (Unemployed) Body for London during the past year, viz. :— WORK. COST. Unskilled labour. Materials, skilled labour and supervision Total. Embanking a further portion of the river W'andle at Garratt Park shoot, and piping and filling in a ditch there £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d. Lowering bank of river Wandle at northern end of Garratt Park shoot, and filling up low-lying ground there 557 9 10 188 10 7 746 0 5 81. As in previous years, the expense of the materials, skilled labour and supervision was borne by the Borough Council, and the Central Body supplied the unskilled labour for the work. 82. The Borough Council also submitted to the Central Body schemes for the construction of an embankment wall at Bell Lane wharf and the piping and filling in of a boundary ditch at Streatham, but the Local Government Board declined to make any contribution out of the Parliamentary grant towards the cost of these works, and the Central Body was therefore unable to undertake them. 83. The Borough Council continued the loan to the Vacant Land Cultivation Society of several small pieces of vacant land in various parts of the Borough for cultivation by the unemployed and other persons of small means, under the direction of the Society. 84. It was again suggested to the London County Council that arrangements should be made with the Central Body for raising the level of the land adjoining the Riversdale and Southfield Council schools, Merton Road, Southfield, so that it might be available for a playing field for children attending the schools in the neighbourhood, and the Borough Council offered to assist by allowing the necessary material to be taken from the adjoining shoot. The County Council did not, however, see its way to proceed with the work. 85. The Borough Council also carried out some channelling works in various parts of the Borough, with the view of the same being executed with unemployed labour. 86. The portion of the old Garratt Lane slop shoot laid out as an open space by the Council in conjunction with the Central (Unemployed) Body during the winter of 1910-11, was opened to the public on 1st June, 1912, under the name of " Tooting Gardens." Tooting Gardens. 87. The Council had under consideiation during the past year the question of improving the public lighting of the streets in the Borough. After correspondence with the various gas companies, arrangements were made for a Lighting. 49 50 number of upright incandescent burners to be converted into inverted burners and for the number of lighting hours to be made practically uniform throughout the Borough. Although the streets will be better lighted, the cost per lamp per annum will be reduced after the first year, when the cost of the alterations has to be borne. With reference to the suggested adoption of high-pressure gas lighting in some of the main roads, the Council decided that, in view of the cost, it was not advisable to take any action at present. It has recently been arranged for a trial to be made of two-burner inverted lamps in one of the main roads, and the question of further improving the lighting of the public streets will continue to receive the attention of the Council. 88. The Borough Council has for several years past been in communication with the London County Council with regard to the flooding which takes place in some parts of the Borough during heavy rainstorms. A certain measure of relief was afforded by the new sewer from Wandsworth to Battersea recently constructed by the County Council, but on the occasion of the severe storms in August, 1911, there was a considerable amount of flooding in several localities. A number of complaints were received, and as the Borough Council felt that immediate action should be taken to provide adequate main sewers to cope with the drainage of the district, a deputation, consisting of the Mayor (Alderman A. D. Dawnay, J.P.), Councillors Garrett and Jackson (Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Highways, Sewers, and Lighting Committee), Aldermen Hewett, J.P., and Penfold, Councillors Doland, Eaton, Nutting, and Plumridge, was appointed to wait upon the County Council on the subject. The deputation was received by the Main Drainage Committee of the County Council on 26th October, 1911, when there were also in attendance deputations from some of the districts affected. The Mayor acted as spokesman for the Borough Council deputation, and urged the Committee to take prompt measures for the relief of the Borough from the liability to floodings from which it had suffered in the past. The representations of the deputations having been considered by the Main Drainage Committee, the County Council, on 7th November, 1911, upon their recommendation, decided to undertake the following works, viz.:— Flooding from Sewers. 51 Estimated cost. (1) A relief sewer from the junction of Balham High Road and Tooting Bee Road to the river Graveney £28,000 (2) Improvement of the waterway of the river Graveney— (a) from its junction with the proposed new sewer to the river Wandle 4,000 (b) near and under Longley Road 1,750 £33.750 89. It is anticipated that these works will prevent flooding from the sewers in the districts around Balham Park Road and Mayford Road, Balham, and at the eastern end of Longley Road, Tooting. .90. More recently the County Council approved an estimate of £100,000 for the construction of a new sewer to prevent flooding in the low-lying areas in the valley of the rivers Wandle and Graveney. The proposed works are in addition to those referred to above and are expected to suffice for the needs of the district for many years. 91. The competition for the swimming trophy presented by Sir William Lancaster, J.P., and competed for annually by men resident in the Borough, was held on the 13th October, and was won by Mr. J. Symons. Sir William Lancaster again gave a prize for the winner, as a memento of the occasion, and the Mayor (Alderman A. D. Dawnay, J.P.), kindly provided a prize for the competitor who finished second. Swimming Championship Trophy. 92. The competition for the medal for women residing in the Borough, presented by the late Mr. John Bell, J.P., was held on the 28th September, at the annual entertainment of the Alexandra Swimming Club, and was won by Miss E. Luff. Women's Medah 52 93. Swimming competitions for school children were held at the Wandsworth Baths on the 13th October, and a free pass to the second-class bath, available during the following year, was awarded to the successful boy or girl from each school. The competitions are open to boys and girls from schools in the Borough attending the baths for instruction in swimming, the passes are available out of school hours before seven o'clock in the evening. A large number of children and their parents were present. All the departments of elementary schools sending pupils to the baths for instruction in swimming entered pupils for the competitions. The number of children taking part in the competitions was 167—97 boys and 70 girls. Swimming Comoetitions for School Children. 94.

The drying closet has been extended by the addition of six new horses, the heater replaced by one of larger heating surface and capable of standing a higher pressure, and a new blower of higher speed provided. A new fan and shaft for ventilating the laundry has also been provided. Wandsworth Baths. —Laundry. 97. The subject of the provision of additional swimming accommodation on the eastern side of the Borough has continued to receive careful consideration, and land at the rear of houses in Elmfield Road, Balham, is being acquired for the purpose of erecting a swimming bath thereon; Provision of Baths. 98. Applications having been made for mixed bathing to be allowed at the Wandsworth baths, the Council, after careful consideration, decided to allow it on Monday evenings, that being considered the most suitable time. Subject to certain regulations which the Council adopted, suitable arrangements have been made at the baths, and the attendance is considered satisfactory. Mixed Bathing. 54 99. The number of interments in the Council's Cemeteries Intermets during the three years ended 31st March, 1910, 1911, and 1912, respectively, was as follows :— 1910. 1911. 1912.

The Council has found it desirable to reduce the fees for common interments in the Streatham and Wandsworth Cemeteries. The new scale has been approved by the Local Government Board, and comes into force on the 30th September, 1912. Burial Fees. ! onjthe 30th September, 1912. The old and new scales are as follows :— Ages at Death. Old Scale (including Minister's fee). New Scale. (including Minister's fee). Parishioners. NonParishioners. Parishioners. NonParishioners. Exceeding one month, but not exceeding six years 11/- 18/- 9/- 14/- Exceeding six years, but not exceeding twelve years 14/- 24 /- 12 /- 20/- Exceeding twelve years 18/- 3 2/- 1 26/— 55 103- On the instructions of the Council the Cemeteries Committee considered the subject of laying out additional land for burials at Putney Vale Cemetery. Before the preparation of a scheme for this purpose it was thought desirable to consider whether further land was required. There is considerable demand for the highest priced spaces in the cemetery, and the Committee considered it would be a great advantage to the cemetery if the high land adjoining Wimbledon Common, and situate between the cemetery and Stag Lane, could be acquired, with the view of providing spaces of this description, and for which it was eminently suitable. The Council adopted this view, and after negotiation with the owners decided, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, to purchase an area of 29 acres, 3 roods, 2 poles at the price of £350 per acre. The Board held a public enquiry into the Council's proposal, and on the 3rd April, 1912, formally approved the purchase, and sanctioned a loan therefor. Steps are being taken to redeem the tithe rent charge payable on this and other land belonging to the Council at Putney Vale. 104. With regard to the laying out of the land the Council decided to retain the services of Mr. Thomas H. Mawson, a landscape architect who has had considerable experience in this kind of work, to prepare plans and designs, and to give an estimate of the cost of tree planting. The Borough Engineer is also preparing an estimate of the cost of drainage, formation of walks and carriageways, fencing, etc. Putney Vale Cemetery. Avenue, Putney Vale. 105. The growth of the shrubs in the Avenue at the entrance to Putney Vale Cemetery appeared to be affected by the adjoining trees, and some of the shrubs died. As the avenue is considered to be a very fine one the Council were anxious to preserve its appearance, and asked the London County Council to allow the Chief Officer of the Parks and Open Spaces Department to advise the Council as to dealing with the trees and shrubs. This request was acceded to, and the works suggested by the Chief Officer are being carried out under the supervision of the Borough Engineer. 106. The memorial to the Huguenots, referred to in the last report (p. 65), has been erected in the Huguenot Burial Ground, East Hill, and was unveiled on the 21st October, 1911, when the Mayor, on behalf of the Council, took charge of the memorial. I) Huguenot Burial Ground. 56 107. During the year notice was received of the intention of the London County Council to acquire property at the corner of St. Ann's Hill and Allfarthing Lane, Fairfield, as a site for a new public elementary school; and the Managers of the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Boys' School, St. Alphonsus Road, Clapham, gave notice of their proposal to enlarge the school by providing additional accommodation for about 120 children. The Borough Council did not offer any objection to either of these proposals. New Schools. 108. The County Council has also found it necessary to erect a new school at Balham, and selected property in Byrne Road and Cornford Grove as a site for the school. There was considerable opposition to this site, and the County Council eventually decided not to proceed with the acquisition thereof, but to purchase the premises Nos. 191, 193 and 195, Balham High Road. The latter site adjoins premises acquired by this Council as a site for public baths, and the County Council approached this Council with a view to an exchange of lands, allowance being made for the respective differences in value. This would have enabled the baths to be erected on the main road, and the school at the rear. This Council, however, did not entertain the proposed exchange as it would have involved them in considerable additional expenditure. A deputation waited upon the Borough Council in opposition to the Balham High Road site, and after considering the representations made, the County Council were requested to receive a deputation from the Borough Council with reference to the approaches and exits to and from the proposed school. It was also pointed out to the County Council that a site on the County Council's own land in Marius Road would be more suitable than any site previously suggested. 109. The subject of the limited powers and duties of school managers has again received consideration, together with resolutions passed by several of the other Borough Councils, and communications have been addressed to the County Council in favour of additional powers being granted. The Council was informed in reply that the appropriate Committee of the County Council regretted that they were not able to recommend any alteration in the duties at present. Powers and duties of Managers. 57 no. Three temporary schools—Camborne Road, Southfield ; Magdalen Road, Springfield ; and The Furzedown, Streatham, have been added for the purposes of management to adjoining groups of schools. In the latter case the additional school necessitated the increase of the number of Managers of the group from twelve to eighteen. Management of Schools. 111. The Aristotle Road (Boys and Girls) School, Clapham, and The Elliott (Mixed) School, Southfield, were duly constituted Central Schools under the scheme referred to in the last annual report (page 61), and the Council were informed that a commercial bias had been approved for the curriculum of such schools. The scheme provided for the withdrawal of the schools from the groups to which they formerly belonged, and the appointment of a separate body of Managers. This part of the scheme was carried out so far as this Council was concerned, but the County Council then stated that they had found it necessary to review the whole question of management, and had decided to reinstate the central schools in the groups to which they had been attached. The Council concurred in this proposal, and the two schools were accordingly reinstated. A special committee, consisting of one manager in respect of each of the contributory schools, has however been set up for each central school, to deal with the admission of pupils and the award of junior county exhibitions. Central Schools. 112. On the invitation of the Association of Representative Managers of London County Council elementary schools the Council appointed Councillor Couzens, the Chairman of the Education Committee, an honorary member of such Association. Association of Representative Managers. 113. The Council decided to concur in the views of the Wandsworth Ratepayers' Association that the regulations for the award of junior county scholarships should be amended so that children not in attendance at public elementary schools could compete on the same terms as those applicable to children who are in attendance at such schools. In the case of the former the parents' income must not exceed £160, while there is no limit in the case of children attending public elementary schools. A communication was addressed to the County Council in the matter, but they did not see their way to make any alteration in the regulations. Junior County Scholarships. 58 APPORTIONMENTS. 114.—The following apportionments of the estimated cost of paving new streets have been made by the Council during the year, viz. :— Date of Apportionment.

General Report on Testings of Gas supplied to the Wandsworth Borough (i) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company; (2) by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company during the Year ended 31ST March, 1912. Wandsworth and Putney Qas Company. In my last annual report (iqio-ii) I referred to the installation Recent Legis'ation and Calorific Power. of a new burner in the Photometer at Disraeli Road, Putney, and to the circumstances which led to it. This new burner is known as the Metropolitan Argand Burner iNo. 2 and has the advantage of being in general use at all the Metropolitan and many provincial gas-testing places. All illuminating power tests during this year ended 31st March, 1912, have been made with the new burner, and the results obtained are therefore entirely comparable with tests made at most gas-testing places in England. At the time the new burner was introduced I again urged the institution of tests of the calorific power of the gas, and the Council having agreed to the suggestion, the Company duly provided a calorimeter and other necessary apparatus, and the tests have been made regularly since September, 1911. I had frequently pointed out, not only in my report of 1910-11 but in many previous reports, that it was of great importance to make these tests for information so as to be able to arrive at a calorific standard applicable to the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company's gas, and so that, in the event of later legislation, a standard calorific power, like the standard illuminating power, might also be set up, or even substituted for this latter. Among the many arguments in favour of this new departure, which I have put forward from time to time in various reports to the Council, I may briefly recapitulate the following:—(1) The increasing use of gas for heating and cooking purposes, and also for motor power, in addition to lighting; (2) further, its extended 1 136 use in incandescent burners, in which a non-luminous hot flame is required; (3) the greater scientific value of the calorific power as a standard of quality of gas as compared with the illuminating power standard, which long experience has shown to be in many respects uncertain and unsatisfactory. All these and other considerations make the general adoption of the calorific power as a standard of quality a practical certainty in the near future. It is with genuine gratification that I am able to refer in this present Annual Report to the final accomplishment of this desirable end and to some other distinct advances in connection with the testings of gas supplied to the Borough. On December, 1911, I received from Mr. H. G. Hills, the late Town Clerk, a copy of the Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Bill, and at his request sent a detailed report on the same, dated January 24th, 1912, which was printed. In that report I called attention to various matters connected with the testing of the gas in which change or reform had long been urgent. The most important points raised may be briefly summarised as follows:—(1) The setting up of a standard calorific power, based on the tests for information which I had made for some months previously. (2) The abolition of fixed times for testing. These hitherto had been restricted to certain hours after sunset under the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1871, an act which was passed over forty years ago, at a time when the illuminating power was apparently the only special value attaching to gas, other applications not having then been contemplated. (3) Uniform testing at all testing places in the district covered by the amalgamated gas companies. After various consultations with the gas companies, in some of which I took part, the Council succeeded in amending the Bill to their satisfaction without formally presenting a petition against it, and it has now, in the amended form, passed through both Houses of Parliament. The Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Act, 1912, comes into operation on January 1st, 1913, and I may now note the coming changes in the testing of the gas, to which I have briefly referred above. 137 In the first place the testings will be uniform throughout the District, that is to say, at all testing places the same tests will be made, viz., calorific power, illuminating power, and sulphur, in addition to sulphuretted hydrogen, and pressure observations, and there will no longer be any fixed hours of testing. The illuminating power standard will be 14 candles (section 57), and it is proposed to use, instead of the candle balance, which is antiquated, Harcourt's 10-candle Pentane lamp as the standard light in the photometer (section 59). The testing places will be the same as the existing ones, but provision is made for an additional testing place in the Wandsworth limits in accordance with a previous arrangement (sections 58 and 65). The pressure still remains at the absurdly low minimum of eighth-tenths of one inch, but there is no danger of this limit being reached, as a much greater pressure is required for the supply of gas (section 60). Testing for sulphur and sulphuretted hydrogen remain as before (section 64). There will be no penalties in connection with the above testings. The Calorific Power* (section 61).—The new calorific power standard has been fixed at 136 calories gross, with a margin of about 10 per cent., the minimum being 122 calories gross. If there is a deficiency on this minimum, the Company is liable to penalties, which increase with the deficiency. It will be noted that gross calorific values have been selected as the standard, and this has been done with the complete acquiescence of the Company. *Calorific Power.—By a calorie is meant the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogramme of water 1 degree Centigrade. For example, a standard of "125 Calories" would mean that the amount of heat produced by the burning of 1 cubic foot of gas (measured at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and 30 inches Barometer) must be such as to raise the temperature of 125 kilogrammes of water 1 degree Centigrade, or, taking British Units, 496 lbs. (500 lbs. nearly) of water 1 degree Fahrenheit. The net calorific power is obtained by subtracting the heat due to the condensation of some of the steam formed in the calorimeter and to the cooling of the resulting condensed water from the total observed heat or gross calorific power. In practice tl e water is measured, not weighed, hence, for practical purposes, 1 litre might be substituted for 1 kilogramme. 12 138 This will be the first Act of Parliament in which a gross calorific power standard has been set up. My reasons for advising it are:— (i) In determining the gross calorific power there is less liability to variation due to experimental error or to temporary defects of the calorimeter, and therefore less liability to dispute in case of a deficiency being found. (2) Except technically there is no difference in the gross calorific standard thus set up to a net calorific standard, since the net calorific standard originally proposed has been translated into gross value. (3) The gas referees lay no special stress on the net calorific value, as the following extract from their "Notification for the Year 191 " will show:— "The heating or calorific power of any sample of gas is represented by the number of calories produced by the combustion of one cubic foot of such gas measured at 60 deg. Fahr. and under a pressure of 30 inches of mercury. The maximum calorific power which gas can thus exert is determined directly by the calorimeter. This is a true measure of the total heating power, and is termed the gross calorific power of the gas. But in many cases in which gas is used as a heating agent, the steam which is formed escapes into the air uncondensed, and thus the heat due to the condensation of the steam and the cooling of the water so formed is not utilised. The amount of heat thus lost can be estimated, and if it is subtracted from the total heat yielded by the combustion of the gas in the calorimeter another value is obtained which is termed the net calorific power of the gas. Since, however, when steam escapes uncondensed, the uncondensable products of combustion also pass away at a high temperature, and since the loss of heat thus arising is commonly the greater of the two, the customary partial correction from gross to net has not much significance." Finally, I may state that the standard calorific power agreed upon has been arrived at from a careful consideration of the tests of calorific power of the gas which I made between October 3rd, 1911, and January 12th, 1912, which yielded an average of 135*3 gross calories (see Report dated January 24th, 1912, above referred to). Inasmuch as tests for illuminating power were invariably made by me at the same time, and average about I5'0 candles, this illuminating power may be said to approximately correspond to a calorific power of about 135 gross calories, but I shall refer to these details later. Wandsworth Borough Council. . " 139 Having now sufficiently discussed recent legislation, and tlie consequent important changes which will be involved, I will proceed to the consideration of the details of the usual testings made during the year ended March 31st, 1912. Usual Tests made during 1911-12. Table I. shows the average illuminating power for each month Illuminating Power. of the annual period, viz., from April, 1911, to March, 1912. From this table it will be seen that the total average for the year ended 31st March, 1912, was 15.1 candles, the minimum being 147 (April and November, 1911, and February, 1912), the maximum being I5.5 (July, 1911). Table III. shows the curve representing weekly variations during the same period, with a minimum weekly average of 14.1 (February, 1912), and a maximum weekly average of 16.1 (September, 1911). In no case has the illuminating power been below 14-0 candles, the statutory limit. The general average is somewhat higher than during the last three years, but, as will be seen from the curve in Table III., there has also been some considerable fluctuation. As noted under "Recent Legislation " in the foregoing pages, Calorific Power. caionnc power tests for lniormation were commenced in September, 1911. During September the results obtained were not very satisfactory, and were partly, without doubt, due to some defects in the calorimeter, newly set up at the time, and which had not been thoroughly adjusted. From October, 1911, to March, 1912, fairly even results were obtained, as will be seen from Table I., in which the monthly averages are shown, and from Table III., which shows the curve of the weekly averages of calorific power determinations. From an inspection of Table I. it will be noted that the general average for the six months ended 31st March, 1912, was 1347 gross calories and 120.9 net, with a maximum monthly average of 136.4 140 gross calories and 121.7 net calories in December, 191 r, and ar minimum, monthly average of I33.1 gross and 120.1 net calories in February, 1912. The weekly averages indicated by the curve in Table III. show that the extreme variation during this same period was not excessive, the minimum being 132 gross calories (November and December, 1911, and February, 1912), and the maximum 141.0 gross calories (March, 1912). The question has, I am aware, been frequently asked as to what is the relation between the illuminating power and the calorific power. So far as general experience goes, at present there does not appear to be any definite relation such as would enable an observer to calculate the one from the other. There are many obvious reasons for this absence of definite relationship. On the other hand, experience has also shown that, as a rule,high illuminating power corresponds to a high calorific power, and this somewhat general deduction is more or less demonstrated on comparing the curves shown in Table III. I have also shown, in Table I., the monthly averages of sulphur Sulphur. (grains in lou cuuic ieet; ior uie year enueu jisi March, 1912. It will be observed that the total average is 22.6 grains, with a minimum monthly average of 15.5 grains (January, 1912), and a maximum of 27.9 grains (May, 1911). In Table III. the curve of weekly averages is shown, and here the minimum is 12 grains, in February, 1912, and the maximum nearly 33 grains, in April, 1911. Thus, while the general average is low, there have been from time to time considerable fluctuations. This impurity has at no time been found to be present during Sulphuretted Hydrogen. this year. Observations of the pressure have been made at the times of Pressure. making all other usual tests, ine general average pressure for the year ended 31st March, 1912, is 3.4 inches, with a maximum of 3.0 and a minimum of 2.1 inches. i4i Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company. There have been no changes to record during the past year as regards mode of testing. Table II. shows the averages of the usual fortnightly testings. Illuminating Power. The total average of all testings for the year ended 31st March, 1912, is 15.9 candles, with a minimum of 15.4 candles in February, 1912, and a maximum of 16.1 candles in December, 1911. The pressure has varied from 3.6 to 47 inches, with a general Pressure. average ior the year oi 4.1 inches. This impurity has not been found in the gas at any time during Sulphuretted IHydrogen. the year. H. Wilson Hake, Ph.D., Gas Examiner. 142 TABLE I.

REPORTS OF Libraries Sub-Committees. 194 REPORT OF THE CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY SUB.COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1912. The Sub.Committee have pleasure in presenting the Twenty. IFifth Annual Report on the work of the Clapham Library. The number of books issued during the year was 140,527 in the Lending Library and 22,615 in the Reference Library, being a total issue of 163,142 volumes, and a daily average of 674 volumes for the 242 days on which the library was open. The number of books now in stock is 18,571, of which 14,798 are in the Lending Library and 3,773 in the Reference Library. Advantage has been taken of the compilation of a new general subject.catalogue of the Lending Library to re.arrange the books in the various classes, and to discard a number of obsolete and worn.out works. 4,183 readers' ordinary tickets (including renewals) and 1,388 students' tickets were issued during the year in the Lending Library. In order to allow of further provision for show.cases, and better accommodation for serving readers, the counters in the Lending Library have been altered under the superintendence of the Borough Engineer. Collapsible gates have also been erected for shutting off the Lending Library (when closed) from the other departments of the institution. The Sub.Committee desire to express their cordial thanks to the donors of various books, periodicals, etc. The Borough Council, in November, 1911, re.appointed the Mayor (Alderman Dawnay, J.P.), Alderman Lidiard, and Councillors Bulcraig, J.P., Cox, Cundall, Duncan, Henderson and Young 195 as the Sub.Committee for the Clapham Library for 1912. Councillor Cundall was re.elected Chairman, with a vote of thanks for his services during the previous year. Several changes have occurred on the staff during the year. Mr. A. Wheatley, caretaker for 22 years, was superannuated, his place being filled by the appointment of Mr. G. Rye. Messrs. H. V. Hind and H. Hetherington, assistants, left to take up other municipal positions, and C. W. Stephens and H. J. Wheeler were engaged as junior assistants. In conclusion the Sub.Committee have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the efficiency of the Librarian and his staff and the general satisfactory working of the Library. On behalf of the Sub.Committee, JAS. W. CUNDALL, Chairman. 6th May, 1912. 196 REPORT OF THE PUTNEY LIBRARY SUB.COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31st March, 1912. 1 The Sub.Committee have pleasure in presenting the Twenty. Fourth Annual Report of the Library. In December, 1911, Councillors Hoile, Jackson, Mathias, Radford and Rawson were appointed by the Borough Council to act as Sub.Committee for the year 1912. Councillor Radford was elected Chairman for the year. A new scheme for the issue of catalogues has been adopted. It is intended to issue a new edition every second year. The first issue under the new scheme was made last year, and was so well received that the edition was exhausted by the end of the year. A bust of the late Sir George Newnes, Bart., the donor of the Library, has been presented to the Library. A committee of local gentlemen, presided over by His Worship the Mayor, Alderman Dawnay, J.P., secured the necessary funds. The bust was unveiled by Sir William White, K.C.B., and formally handed over by him on May 23rd, 1911, to His Worship the Mayor, who accepted it on behalf of the Borough. With a view to economy the list of newspapers, etc., has been curtailed and a reduction of £10 has been made in the estimates for the ensuing year. The Annual Estimates for the year amounted to £1,173. the estimated product of a penny rate in the Putney Ward, plus receipts from the sale of catalogues, etc. The decision of the Sub.Committee to keep the Lending Department open on Thursdays has been appreciated, and good use has been made of the department on that day. The Sub.Committee desire to thank the donors of various books and newspapers to the Library. »97 Lending Department. The stock in the Lending Department has increased by 816 volumes ; of these 798 were acquired by purchase and 18 were presented. Two hundred and sixty. seven volumes were withdrawn from stock, and 360 worn.out books were replaced, making a total of 13,464 volumes now available for the use of borrowers. The issues have increased by 9,337 volumes, the total number being 84,980, as compared with 75,643 issued during the year 1910.11. On March 31st, 2,443 borrowers' tickets and 346 students' tickets were available for use in the department. The sum of £115 os. iod. was received from the sale of catalogues, fines, etc., during the year. Reference Department. The Reference Library is shelved in open cases, a plan greatly appreciated by readers. During the year 24 volumes have been added to the stock, making the total 2,450 volumes. Magazine Room. Thirty.nine monthly magazines and reviews, seven quarterlies and 55 weekly periodicals are placed in these rooms, which continue to be used by an increasing number of readers. The magazines and reviews are transferred to the Lending Department when replaced by new issues, and are greatly in demand for home reading. News Room. The list of newspapers, etc., provided in this room includes 32 daily newspapers, among which are Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Manchester and Plymouth daily journals, 53 weekly newspapers and periodicals, and 57 monthly and quarterly publications. A hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. A. W. Gosden for his services as Chairman of the Sub.Committee during the year. The Sub.Committee again have much pleasure in recording their satisfaction with the work of the Librarian and his Staff. Signed on behalf of the Putney Library Sub.Committee, J. C. RADFORD, Chairman. 198 REPORT OF THE STREATHAM, BALHAM AND TOOTING LIBRARIES SUB.COMMITTEE, For the Year ended 31ST March, 1912. The Sub.Committee have pleasure in submitting their report on the work of the Streatham, Balham and Tooting Libraries for the year ended 31st March, 1912. The followirg members of the Borough Council were appointed, in November last, the Sub.Committee for 1911.12 : Councillor T. W. Watson (Chairman), the Mayor (Alderman A. D. Dawnay, J.P.), Alderman W. J. Hewett, J.P., Councillors the Rev. J. H. Anderson, M.A., T. J. Cox, J. Garrett, J. T. Hallinan, C. Kingston, and A. Douglas Robinson, M.A., LL.B. Books Issued. The number of books issued at the three libraries was 487,013, an increase of 685 on last year's return. The circulation at each library was as follows :— Li bra r Lending Library. For Reference purposes. Total. Average Daily Issue. The Tate Library 191,861 10,791 202,652 841 Balham Library 166,928 6,169 173,097 718 Tooting Library 108,812 2,452 111,264 461 Total Number of Volumes issued 487,013 2,020 Particulars of the number of books issued in the various classes of literature will be found tabulated on page 205. The figures given above for the Streatham and Balham Libraries respectively are the highest totals that have been recorded since their establishment. The small decrease which has occurred at the Tooting Library is confined entirely to works of fiction, the issues in the other classes of literature having slightly increased. 199 Borrowers' Tickets. Borrowers' The number of Borrowers' Tickets issued Tickets. during the year was as follows :— No. of Tickets issued. Library. Ordinary Tickets. Students' Tickets. Total. The Tate Library 5,371 2,335 7,706 Balham Library 4,135 563 4,698 Tooting Library 2,721 1,177 3.898 Total 12,227 4,075 16,302 The large number of Students' Tickets issued (especially at the Tate Library) is an indication that this additional privilege continues to be much appreciated by borrowers. Students attending the local classes of the London Workers' Educational Association have been granted the same facilities for pursuing their studies as those afforded to students attending the University Extension Lectures. Stock. Every year the selection of books for the libraries necessitates increasing care in seeing that important works are not overlooked, careful consideration being also given to the provision of suitable books bearing on the numerous and varied subjects of general interest occupying public attention. The extensive use which is made of the libraries necessarily involves every year a considerable outlay for the replacement of populai works that constant use has rendered unfit for further circulation. The stock at the 31st March, after making the necessary deductions on account of replacements and discarded books, numbered 46,596 volumes, located as follows :— No. of Volumes. The Tate Library, Streatham 22,357 Balham Public Library 14,007 Tooting Public Library 10,232 Total 46,596 200 More detailed information respecting the stock is given in the general table on page 206. At the annual stocktaking in July the number of books which could not be accounted for was four. 3.930 volumes were re.bound during the year. The constant attention given by the staff to the repair of books tends largely to keep down the expense of bookbinding. Sir William J. Lancaster, J.P., has again manifested his kind interest in the Tooting Library by presenting a copy of the " Victoria History of Middlesex " to the Reference Department. The cataloguing work at the libraries has been specially heavy during the past year. A new Subject.Catalogue, in dictionary form, of the books in the Tooting Library was published in September. The revision and renewal of cards in the card catalogues and the re.cataloguing of the stock at the Tate Library have also demanded close attention. The monthly lists of additions have been posted regularly at each library. Cataloguing. Cash Receipts. Cash The following is a statement of the receipts Receipts. from fines, sale of catalogues, etc., at the three libraries :— £ s. d. The Tate Library, Streatham 138 17 6 Balham Public Library 89 18 0 Tooting Public Library 64 6 4 Total £293 1 10 The amount paid by borrowers to replace lost or damaged books was £9 is. nd. Reading Rooms. A list of the newspapers and periodicals supplied to the Reading Rooms is given on pages 207.216. The list'of papers purchased for the libraries was revised by the Sub.Committee in January. 201 The Reading Rooms continue to be largely attended at all times of the year, and the selection of periodical literature provided appears to meet with general satisfaction. The rooms are open on Sundays (except during the months of July, August and September) from 3 to 9 p.m. The work of painting the exterior wood and iron work of the Balham Library and sundry repairs at the Tooting Library received attention during the year. The difficulties of administration arising from the present insufficient accommodation at the Tate Library have for some time past occupied the attention of the Sub.Committee. Unfortunately, the Libraries Committee are unable at present to recommend the Council to sanction the small loan that would be necessary to carry out the Sub.Committee's proposals for enlarging the Lending Department and providing the public with facilities for consulting books of reference. Signed on behalf of the Sub.Committee, THOS. W. WATSON, Chairman. 6th May, 1912. 202 REPORT OF THE WANDSWORTH LIBRARIES SUB.COMMITTEE. For the Year ended 31st March, 1912. The Committee appointed by the Council in November, 1911, were Councillor Harrison (Chairman), the Mayor, Councillors Couzens, Everett, B.A., Evershed, Junr., J. A. Robinson and Shillington. A vote of thanks was passed to Councillor W. J. Harrison for his services as Chairman during last year. Issues. The efforts of the Sub.Committee have been specially devoted to leading users of the Library into the reading of literature which is calculated to improve and instruct as well as providing for them interesting and entertaining books for leisure hours. The results are very satisfactory in that the proportion of educative issues has gone up, whilst that of fiction has gone down, and it is hoped to see further advances in the same direction. The gross issues are higher (see tabulated statement). Coronation. The Libraries were closed for the Coronation event on June 22nd and 23rd. Annual Closing. It was decided that no change be made in the date of the annual closing of the three libraries in Wandsworth. Maintenance. West Hill Library. The linoleum at the West Hill Library, after being down since 1885, has been renewed at a cost «f £23. Reference Room. The facilities for readers are so deficient and the impossibility of bringing all the book stock of this class into one place is so apparent, that the Committee can only in the absence of the means to rectify the trouble, put the facts on 203 record in the hope that one day soon this disadvantage may be removed. No plan of the library buildings at West Hill being in existence, it was considered advisable to have one prepared by the Borough Engineer. Plan. Catalogue. Allfarthing Lane Library. Catalogue of the books at Allfarthing Lane Library was ordered to be printed. Painting and Decorating. In accordance with the terms of the lease the work inside and out at this branch was carried out at a cost of £60. To avoid disturbance to readers in the newsroom the chairs have been fitted with noiseless rubber pads. Garratt Lane Library. The issues have gone up very considerably and the space at our disposal there for stock is becoming so inadequate that steps must be taken at an early date to provide proper accommodation if the needs of the district are to be even approximately met. General. Expenditure. The decision of the Libraries Committee to allocate the library rate on a different basis enabled this Sub.Committee to increase its book purchases. Donations. Various donations of books, etc., were made during the year, and suitable acknowledgments sent to the donors. Cash Receipts. Fines, etc., amounting to £104 10s. gd. were received. Staff. An insurance policy has been taken out to relieve the Council of compensation responsibility in the event of accident to any member of the staff. During the year Mr. S. Bastin was elected to fill a vacancy in the Rating Department; Mr. A. Freeman was promoted, and his place filled 204 by Mr. R. G. Austin, who afterwards passed the 2nd division civil service examination and on leaving was replaced by Mr. R. T. Mayrick. Mr. T. Cooper, porter, West Hill Library, has retired on superannuation allowance, his place being filled by Mr. J. A. Bright. Mr. J. Hawes, porter, Garratt Lane Library, was replaced by Mr. J. Phillips. The attention of the Librarian and his Assistants at the three libraries was all that could be desired, and they are thanked for same. Signed on behalf of the Wandsworth Libraries Sub-Committee, J.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1911. Population. From a return which has been furnished by the Registrar General it is possible to give the exact population enumerated at the Census taken on the 2nd April, 1911. From 1905 to 1910 the population has been, for the purpose of this Report, estimated by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Census of 1901 by the number of rated hereditaments in that year, and then multiplying the number of rated hereditaments in the middle of each year by the factor thus obtained. This method has given fallacious results, due to the fact that there has been a great decrease in the number of persons per rated hereditament as compared with 1901. 2 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Registrar General, in his preliminary report, states that the estimations of the population of London based on the number of inhabited tenements have been framed for the London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, and that the total error in the population of London is only half that by the old method, but that one of the most noticeable features was in the case of Wandsworth, which was over-estimated by nearly 10 per cent., while it was nearly correct by the old method. He further says: "These instances serve to show that the best devised methods for estimating populations of local areas cannot be considered trustworthy in the later years of a decennium, even under the most favourable circumstances. "They, therefore, emphasize the importance of more frequent Census enumerations, not only in the interest of vital statistics and sanitary progress, but also for the purpose of ensuring the proper distribution of public funds when this is to be determined by the number of the population." The following Table shows the Census population for each of the Wards for 1901 and 1911, with the percentage increase in each Ward:— Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 3 TABLE I. Ward. Males.

An examination of the above shows that the increase in the different Wards has varied considerably, being as low as 33 per cent. in Clapham North, and as high as 1183 per cent. in Tooting. The total increase for the Borough was 79,368 persons, 36,980 males and 42,388 females, or 343 per cent. This was the largest increase in the Metropolitan Area, the next being Lewisham with 26.2 per cent. The increase in the Borough is not so great as in the decennium 1891-1901, when it was 49.2 per cent. For the whole of London the population was 4,522, 961, compared with 4,536,267 in 1901, a decrease of 3 per cent. Table I. also shows that the number of males increased by 35.6 per cent. and the number of females by 33 per cent. In the subdistricts the percentage increase in the number of males was less than of females in Putney and Springfield, while in the other subdistricts this percentage was higher.

The number of persons per rated hereditament has decreased in the whole Borough from 5.35 to 4.67, a diminution having occurred in all the sub-districts with the exception of Fairfield Ward, where there was a slight increase. The diminution was greatest in Clapham South, and Springfield, and least in Tooting.

The total population of the above Institutions was 7,855, an increase of 1,885 since 1901, the increase being largely due to the erection of Tooting Bec Asylum. As, however, a proportion of the inmates of the Footing Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to this Borough, a deduction of 5,189 persons, 3,164 males and 2,025 females, made from the uncorrected population gives approximately the corrected population, 308,156, compared with 300,061 in 1910, and 290,462 in 1909. As the complete Census returns will not be available till the close of 1912, no particulars can be given as to occupation or overcrowding. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 30th December, 1911, 6,699 births, 3,365 of males and 3,334 of females, were registered, compared with 6,967 in 1910, 6,985 in 1909, 7,331 in 1908, and 7,036 in 1907. The total number of births registered in this Borough was 6,555, but 216 births occurred in Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough, and 72 births in Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, making a corrected total of 6,699. Of the 216 births which were registered outside the Borough, with the exception of 10 all occurred in Poor-Law or Lying-in Institutions, 107 in Clapham Maternity, 47 in the General Lying-in Hospital, 24 in St. Thomas's Hospital, and 38 in various Institutions in other parts of London. In Table V. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough. 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The rate for the whole Borough is much lower than any previously recorded, being 1.48 per 1,000 under 1910, and 4 26 under the decennial average. The birth-rates for the year in all the sub-districts and in the Borough as a whole show a considerable reduction compared with the decennial average, while compared with the previous year there has been a reduction in all the sub-districts, especially in Tooting and Wandsworth, with the exception of Clapham, where there is a slight increase in this rate. The birth-rate for the whole of London was 25.0 per 1,000, compared with 25.39 in 1910 and 27.55 the decennial average, while for England and Wales the rate was 24.4 per 1,000, compared with 25.05 in 1910, and 27.20 the decennial average. The proportion of births to the number of possible mothers, or the total number of females living in the Borough at ages 15 to 45 years, was, in 1908, 89.5, in 1909, 82.4, in 1910, 80.1, and in 1911, 73.1. In London it was, in 1910, 86.3, and in 1911, —; and in England and Wales, in 1909, the last available return, 102.3. The legitimate birth-rate, calculated on the married female population, was, in 1901, 215 per 1,000, and, in 1911, 180; while for London it was 186 in 1910, and in England and Wales 234 in 1901, and 209 in 1909. These rates will require correction when the detailed Census returns for 1911 are available. The Registrar General states that in the main the fall in the birth-rate is due to diminished fertility of married women, and that this diminished fertility is due, in some measure, probably to their greater average age, but largely no doubt to deliberate restriction of child bearing. 159 births occurred in the Workhouse during the year, and of these 13 belonged to Clapham, eight to Putney, 67 to Streatham, 14 to Tooting, 35 to Wandsworth, 62 to Battersea, and xo to other places. 10 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of these 159 births 104 were illegitimate, nine belonging to Clapham, six to Putney, 13 to Streatham, eight to Tooting, 22 to Wandsworth, 37 to Battersea, and nine to other places. In the Borough, excluding the Workhouse, 111 illegitimate births occurred, 24 in Clapham, nine in Putney, 23 in Streatham, 23 in Tooting, and 32 in Wandsworth. Of the births registered outside the Borough, 11, four males and seven females, were illegitimate. One of these belonged to Clapham, one to Putney, three to Streatham, one to Tooting, and five to Wandsworth. The total number of illegitimate births was 180, 34 of which belonged to Clapham, 16 to Putney, 39 to Streatham, 32 to Tooting, and 59 to Wandsworth, compared with 185 in 1910, 175 in 1909, and 177 in 1908. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2'68, compared with 2.65 in 1910. 2.50 in 1909, 2.41 in 1908, and 3.4 for the whole of London for 1910. The following Table shows the percentage of illegitimate births to total births for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and for the three previous years:— 1908 1909 1910 1911 Clapham 2.45 3.58 2.46 2.60 Putney 3.42 3.41 3.05 3.32 Streatham 2.08 2.24 2.87 2.15 Tooting 2.88 2.65 2.60 3.20 Wandsworth 2.20 2.25 2.51 2.8l Whole Borough 2.41 2.50 2.65 2.68 Notification of Births Act.

In the sub-districts these percentages were—In Clapham 70.3 and 207, compared with 61.1 and 38.9 in 1910; in Putney 66.8 and 33.2, compared with 50.0 and 50.0; in Streatham 60.1 and 39.9, compared with 55.1 and 44.9; in Tooting 60.5 and 395, compared with 61.2 and 38.8; and in Wandsworth 79'g and 20.1, compared with 65.6 and 34.4. A considerable increase has taken place in all the sub-districts, especially in Wandsworth. The proportion of still-births to total births was 2.2 per cent., compared with 1.7 per cent. in 1910, and with 2.2 per cent., the mean for the whole of London for the year 1910. The work carried out by the female Sanitary Inspectors in connection with the Notification of Births Act is given later on in this Report when dealing with Infantile Mortality. Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending the 30th December, 1911, 3,456 deaths, 1,615 of males and 1,841 of females, were registered, compared with 2,856 in 1910, 3,279 in 1909, 3,230 in 1908, and 3,337 in 1907. Compared with 1910 there has been an increase of 600 deaths, but a decrease of 281 compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate for the Borough was 11.02 02 per 1,000, compared with 8.16 in 1910, 11.08 in 1909. 11.24 in 1908, and 11.94 in 1907. The average uncorrected rate for the decennium 1901-1910 was 11.93, or .91 above the rate for the year 1911. 13 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the sub-districts these rates were as follows:—10.84 in Clapham, 8.64 in Putney, 878 in Streatham, 21.53 in Tooting and 10.09 in Wandsworth. The reason for the high rate in Tooting is that in that subdistrict there are a number of Public Institutions, as the Tooting Bec Asylum and the Tooting Home, where persons from other parts of London are received and among whom the mortality is very great. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Out-lying Institutions and other places of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions and other places in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The deaths occurring in other parts of England and Wales are for the first time included, as these are now received from the Registrar General. Only the deaths occurring in the first three quarters of the year are, however, available this year. The total number of deaths for the 52 weeks, corrected for both internal and external Institutions and other places was 3,776, compared with 3,105 in 1910, 3,520 in 1909, 3,380 in 1908, 3,416 in 1907, 3,461 in 1906, and 3,871 the decennial average corrected for increase of population. During the year 721 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 129 in other places in the Borough. Of the total of 850 deaths, 669 were of persons not belonging and 181 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table IX. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table X. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table XI. of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred. 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health, table ix.

The total number of deaths in out-lying Institutions was 989, 549 of males and 440 of females, compared with 812 in 1910, 897 in 1909, and 783 in 1908. 405 of these deaths occurred in Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries, compared with 395 in 1910; 454 in General ard Special Hospitals, compared with 317 in 1910; 77 in Public Lunatic or Imbecile Asylums, compared with 90 in 1910; and 53 in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, compared with 10 in 1910. Of the 454 deaths in General and Special Hospitals, 62 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, 43 in Bolingbroke Hospital, 19 in Belgrave Hospital, 34 in Victoria Hospital, 16 in St. George's Hospital, 16 in Westminster Hospital, eight in King's College Hospital, 21 in Guy's Hospital, 19 in Long Grove Asylum, 10 in Horton Asylum, 10 in Banstead Asylum, 10 in Charing Cross Hospital, nine in Cane Hill Asylum, seven in Middlesex Hospital, nine in West London Hospital, and seven in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In the South Western Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, there were 24 deaths, one from Diphtheria, one from Enteric Fever, 21 from Measles, and one from other causes. In the Western Hospital there were 26 deaths, two from Enteric Fever, two from Whooping Cough, one from Diphtheria, one from Cerebro-spinal Fever, and 20 from Measles ; and in the Park Hospital three deaths, one from Measles, and two from other causes. The number of deaths in these and other Institutions outside the Borough is shown on Table LXXX. The corrected number of deaths after adding the deaths of persons belonging to the Borough and subtracting those of persons dying in the Borough and not belonging thereto, was 3,775, 1,833 of males and 1,943 of females, an increase of 670 compared with 1910, but a decrease of 96 compared with the corrected decennial average. 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The corrected death-rate for the year was 12*25, compared with 10.34 in 1910 12.11 in 1909, 11.97 in 1908 and 12.09 in 1907and 12.55 the rate for the 10 years 1901-1910.

The death-rate in England and Wales in 1911 was 14.6 per 1,000, compared with 13.4 in 1910, 14.5 in 1909, and 14.7 in 1908 ; in the 77 Great Towns 16.4, compared with 14.3 in 1910, 147 in 1909, and 14.9 in 1908; and in the 136 Smaller Towns 14.4, compared with 12.9, 13.9 and 14.0. If a comparison is to be made with other places it is necessary to again correct the corrected rate, viz. 12.25, for age and sex distribution. This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained by dividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales at the Census of 1901, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period, the standard death-rate at the Census 1911, not yet being available. This factor has been ascertained to be 1.0547, which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1911 of 12.92 per 1,000, compared with 10.90 in 1910, 12.77 in 1909 and 12.62 in 1908. The following Table shows the standard death-rate, the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected death-rate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29, Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1911. The figures are extracted from the Quarterly Returns of the Registrar General for the year, and are completely corrected as between individual Metropolitan Boroughs. The rate in Wandsworth is also corrected for the whole of England and Wales. The Table is, this year therefore only approximately correct, but gives a fairly exact estimate of the rates for the year. 25 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XV. AREA.

In the separate sub-districts of the Borough the corrected death-rate was 11.02 in Streatham, 11.88 in Putney, 11.73 in Tooting, 13.15 in Clapham, and 13.29 in Wandsworth. The rates in all the sub-districts were much higher than in 1910, due to causes which will be commented on in another part of this Report. Table XVI. shows the death-rate in the Borough, in the five sub-districts, and in England and Wales for the year, as well as the rates for the previous 10 years, compared with the decennial average. This Table has been calculated from the Census population of 1911, and shows more correctly than could be done in intercensal years the exact mortality in the various places. During the previous decennium the lowest mortality in all the sub-districts, as well as in London and England and Wales, was in the year 1910. The rate in 1911, although higher than in 1910, is still, in all the subdistricts with the exception of Streatham, lower than the average of the previous 10 years. Compared with London and with England and Wales the Borough rate is considerably lower. 27 Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Whole Borough. London. England and Wales.

The first Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough for each fortnight, compared with the quinquennial average 1906-1910. The Chart shows that on 10 fortnights the rate was above that for the previous quinquennium, viz.:—on the fortnights ended the 25th February, nth March, 25th March, 8th April, 22nd April, 12th August, 26th August, 9th September, 23rd September, and 21st October. During the rest of the year the fortnightly rate was under the quinquennial rates. The highest rate, 17.28, occurred during the fortnight ending the 25th March, and this was due to the great number of deaths from Measles and Respiratory diseases; and the lowest rate during the fortnight ending the 29th July, when it was 7 92 per 1,000. The next Chart shows the Annual Death-rate per 1,000 during each week of the year for the whole of London and for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. During the year, with the exception of the four weeks of March, the rate in this Borough was under the rate for the whole of London. The highest rate in London was in the third week of August, and the lowest on the last week of June. Table XVII. shows the vital statistics of the whole Borough for the year and for the previous 10 years, as well as the average for the 10 years. This Table shows clearly the variations in the births and deaths, the birth and death-rates, and the infantile mortality for the decennium, compared with the year 1911. Compared with the decennial average there has been a considerable decrease in the birth-rate and a slight decrease in the death-rate, while the infantile mortality, which for the past 10 years had shown a most satisfactory decrease, now shows a considerable increase and was higher than it has been since the year 1906. It will also be seen that there has been an increase of 291 deaths of residents in Public Institutions outside the Borough, compared with the 10 years' average. The corrected death-rate, although higher than it has been since 1906, is still under the 10 years' average.

Table XVIII. is the general mortality Table for the whole district, corrected for internal and external Institutions, and also includes all deaths occurring in other places in London during the year, and in England and Wales for three quarters of the year. This Table differs to some extent from the Tables in previous Reports in that the causes of death are differently arranged, and are given more in detail. The age grouping has also been altered to correspond with the Tables used by the Registrar General. 31 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XVIII.

The four Tables which follow are inserted by request of the Local Government Board. Table I. is arranged to show the gross births and deaths in the district, and the births and deaths belonging to it with the corresponding rates. The rates in column 7 are calculated on the gross population, and the rates in 5 and 13 on the nett population, i.e., the population obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in Public Institutions. The population given in column 2 of this Table is the population after the above correction has been made. Table II. shows the number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the separate sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed to hospital from the whole Borough. Table III. is the general mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, and at certain ages, arranged as to cause of death. It also shows the number of deaths in Public Institutions and other places in the district, both of residents and non-residents. Table IV. shows in detail the deaths of infants under one year of age from certain diseases, arranged in weekly age periods, the first four weeks, from one to three months, and for three monthly periods up to one year. 33 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. TABLE XXIII. Sub-Districts. Under 1 year. 1 to 5 years. 5 to 15 years. 15 to 25 years. 25 to 65 years. 65 years and upwards Clapham 20.3 9.27 3.61 2.71 34.06 30.32 Putney 20.77 6.82 2.37 3.26 32.06 34.72 Streatham 16.95 9.04 3.01 4.23 32.30 34.46 Tooting 28.71 15.10 8.17 3.46 28.96 16.58 Wandsworth 25.14 13.20 4.51 4.0I 29.41 23.73 Whole Borough 21.80 10.85 4.00 3.68 31.37 28.32 Compared with 1910 the percentage of deaths under one year was 4.35 higher; from one to five years 3.22 higher; from five to 15 years .20 higher; from 15 to 25 years .57 lower; from 25 to 65 years 4.21 lower; and from 65 years and upwards 2.86 lower. There was a considerable diversity in these rates in the different sub-districts. I In Streatham the rate under one year was only i6'95, while in Tooting it was 2871, while over 65 years of age Tooting had a rate of 16.58 and Putney of 3472. Again, as has been noted also in previous Reports, at from one to five years the rate was still high in Tooting and low in Streatham, and also at ages five to 15, while at ages 25 to 65, and over 65 the Tooting rates were much lower. 38 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The increase in the percentage of deaths under five years was due to the great increase in the number of deaths from Measles, Diarrhoea and Enteritis. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year was 823, compared with 545 in 1910, 601 in 1909, 720 in 1908, and 715 in 1907, and is 52 under the decennial average corrected for increase of population. Of these, 156 occurred in Clapham, 70 in Putney, 180 in Streatham, 116 in Tooting, and 301 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality, or deaths under one year to 1,000 births was 122, compared with 78 in 1910, 86 in 1909, 98 in 1908, 101 in 1907, and 125 in 1906. This rate was 119 in Clapham, compared with 104 the decennial average; 145 in Putney, compared with 112; 99 in Streatham, compared with 96; 116 in Tooting, compared with 137, and 143 in Wandsworth, compared with ill. In the whole Borough the rate was 54 per 1,000 births above that for 1910, and 13 above the decennial average. The rate in 1911 was higher than it has been since 1906,'when it was 125 per 1,000, and in the 10 years previous to 1911 it has only been higher in 1901, 1902, 1904, and 1906. In all the sub-districts, with the exception of Tooting, there has been a marked increase in this rate compared with the decennial average, this increase having been greatest in Putney and Wandsworth. In Tooting the rate is lower by 21 than the decennial average, and it has only been lower during the decennium in that sub-district in the years 1909 and 1910. 39 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Generally speaking, compared with the last two years, the increase in the rate has been, in the sub-district of Clapham, due to the increase in the number of deaths from Measles, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Enteritis, Premature Birth and Congenital Debility; in Putney, to Diarrhoea, Enteritis, Premature Birth and Congenital Debility; in Streatham, to Diarrhoea, Enteritis and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs; in Tooting, to Measles, Diarrhoea, and Enteritis; and in Wandsworth, to Measles, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea and Enteritis. The following Table shows the number of deaths, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year and for the three previous years for each sub-district and for the whole Borough.

The total number of births was 6,699, of which 6,519 were legitimate and 180 illegitimate, and of deaths 823, of which 81 were illegitimate. From the notifiable infectious diseases there were four deaths, three from Diphtheria and one from Erysipelas. 41 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From Measles there were 41 deaths, a considerable increase compared with previous years. 21 of the deaths occurred in the sub-district of Wandsworth, 10 in Putney, five in Clapham, four in Streatham, and one in Tooting. From Whooping Cough there were 29 deaths, from Diarrhoeal diseases 274, from Premature Birth 101, from other diseases of infancy 160, from Tuberculous diseases 23, from diseases of the Respiratory Organs 118, from Convulsions 23, from Syphilis nine, from Suffocation (overlying) three, and from other causes 23. Compared with 1910 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Measles, other diseases of Infancy, and diseases of the Respiratory Organs. In all the deaths, with three exceptions, one in Clapham, one in Streatham, and one in Tooting, the cause of death was certified by a medical man or by a coroner after inquest. 29.5 of the deaths occurred in the first month, compared with 40 9 in 1910, and 37.4 in 1909; 437 in the first three months, compared with 59.4 and 54.4; and 65.9 in the first six months, compared with 74-5 and 73. The Table shows that 101 died from Premature Birth, of which 96 occurred under one month, and 146 from Congenital Debility and Malformations, compared with 110 in 1910, and 124 in 1909. Of the total deaths under one month, viz.:—243, 96 occurred from Premature Birth and 85 from Congenital Debility and Malformations, a percentage of 74.4, compared with 80 per cent, in 1910. From Diarrhoeal diseases only 10 deaths occurred under one . month. The greatest mortality from these diseases occurred at three to six months, and six to nine months. From Tuberculous diseases 23 deaths occurred, 16 from Tuberculous Meningitis, one from Tuberculous Peritonitis, and 42 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. six from other Tuberculous diseases, compared with 14 in 1910, 17 in 1909, and 26 in 1908; and 118 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, compared with 108, 115 and 134. Five deaths were registered as due to Meningitis, but enquiries of the medical attendant showed that all these were due to simple Meningitis. Table XXVI. shows the proportion of deaths per 1,000 births from five groups of diseases for each week under one month, from one to three months and for each three months up to one year of age. Compared with 1910 the rate from common infectious diseases is higher, due to the increase in the number of deaths from Measles and Whooping Cough, this increase having been greatest in Tooting, and Wandsworth. From Diarrhœal diseases there was a very large increase, the rate having been four times greater than in 1910. From Premature Birth, Congenital Debility and Malformations the rate was only slightly higher than in 1910, and this was also the case from Tubercular disease and from other causes. From the Table it will be seen that the rate from common infectious diseases was highest at the ages nine to 12 months, from Diarrhoeal diseases at three to six months, from Premature Birth, etc., under one month, from Tuberculous diseases at nine to 12 months, and from other causes from three to six months.

Table XXVII shows the infantile mortality per 1,000 births from all causes and from certain causes for the whole Borough and for each sub-district. From Premature Birth the rate was lowest in Tooting and highest in Wandsworth, from Developmental diseases highest in Putney and lowest in Streatham, from Diarrhœal diseases highest in Putney and lowest in Streatham, from Measles and Whooping Cough highest in Wandsworth and lowest in Streatham, from Respiratory diseases highest in Putney and lowest in Streatham, from Tuberculous diseases highest in Tooting and lowest in Streatham, and from other causes highest in Streatham and lowest in Clapham. The Table also shows the rates for certain groups of diseases compared with the five previous years. From Premature Birth, the notifiable diseases, Respiratory diseases, Accidental and other causes, there has been a reduction, and from Developmental diseases, Diarrhoea, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Tuberculous diseases there has been an increase. This increase is marked in all the sub-districts in the case of Diarrhoea. It was noted in the Report for 1910 that the infantile mortality rate was the lowest on record, but in 1911 there was a considerable increase, more especially in the sub-districts of Putney and Wandsworth. The climatic conditions were this year most favourable for Diarrhoea and digestive diseases of infants, and the deaths from Measles and Whooping Cough in Tooting and Wandsworth were also influenced by such conditions. In July, August, and September the air temperature was above the 65 year's average on 76 days out of 92, compared with only 15 days in 1910 and 27 days in 1909, when the Diarrhoea mortality was low, and in 1911 the rainfall was much under the average, rain falling on 22 days, compared with 3.7 in 1910 and 45 in 1909. In July and August very high temperatures were recorded, the mean daily temperature on the 9th August having been the highest ever recorded. 45 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There is no doubt that these climatic conditions were the cause of the largely increased mortality from Diarrhoea and Enteritis in infants. This will be well seen on the Chart facing page 98. Sixteen of the deaths occurred in July, 148 in August, and 60 in September. The high rate in Putney was due to Developmental diseases and Diarrhoea, and in Wandsworth to Diarrhoea and Measles. It is satisfactory to note that in Tooting the mortality was 116, which although 24 per 1,000 higher than it was in 1910, is still five per 1,000 under the average for the previous five years. 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Totals 870 911 843 984 877 995 844 841 828 667 1154 144.0 ... The total number of deaths from these diseases was 1,154, 218 in Clapham, 73 in Putney, 279 in Streatham, 165 in Tooting, and 419 in Wandsworth, an increase of 487 compared with 1910, and of 142 compared with the corrected decennial average. Compared with 1910 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Enteric Fever, Diphtheria, Puerperal Fever, 49 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Erysipelas, Measles, Diarrhoea, Tuberculous diseases, and other infective diseases, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, and Influenza. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Measles, Diarrhoea and other infective diseases, but a decrease in all the others. From all infective diseases the death-rate was 374 per 1,000, (3.69 in Clapham, 2.57 in Putney, 2.89 in Streatham, 4.84 in Tooting, and 4.65 in Wandsworth), compared with 2.23 in 1910, and 3.28 the decennial average. The rate from the principal infective diseases, viz.:—Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea, was 2.26 per 1,000 (202 in Clapham, 1.41 in Putney, 1.55 in Streatham, 3.28 in Tooting, and 3.07 in Wandsworth), compared with 78 in 1910. The high rate from these diseases was due to the increase in the number of deaths from Measles and Diarrhoea. In out lying Institutions 316 deaths occurred from Infective diseases (60 belonging to Clapham, 27 to Putney, 64 to Streatham, 45 to Tooting, and 120 to Wandsworth), compared with 196 in 1910. Of these deaths 136 occurred in Workhouse Infirmaries, one from Enteric Fever, one from Diphtheria, two from Erysipelas, 66 from Tuberculous diseases, four from Puerperal Fever, one from Measles, three from Whooping Cough, 53 from Diarrhoea, and five from other infective diseases; 113 in General and Special Hospitals, two from Whooping Cough, two from Diphtheria, three from Influenza, 44 from Diarrhoea, 59 from Tuberculous diseases, and three from other infective diseases; 16 in Public Lunatic Asylums, 10 from Tuberculous diseases and six from Diarrhoea; and 51 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, two from Whooping Cough, two from Diphtheria, three from Enteric Fever, one from Diarrhoea, and one from Cerebro-spinal Fever. B 2 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Institutions in the Borough 140 deaths from infective diseases occurred of persons not belonging thereto, compared with 91 in 1910. The increase in 191 x is due to the increase in the number of deaths from Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, and Tuberculous diseases. Of these deaths 63 occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, eight from Scarlet Fever, 23 from Diphtheria, 25 from Whooping Cough, two from Measles, and five from other causes.. 14 deaths from these diseases occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, 13 from Tuberculous diseases and one from Diarrhoea; 11 in the Tooting Bee Asylum, 21 in the Hostel of God, and 18 in the Tooting Home, all from Tuberculous diseases; one in the Royal Hospital for Incurables from Erysipelas, and one from Tuberculous disease ; one in H.M. Prison from Tuberculous disease ; one in the Workhouse, and one in The Priory from other infective diseases. In other places not institutions 13 deaths occurred, one from Whooping Cough, one from Influenza, six from Tuberculous diseases, and five from Diarrhoea. In Institutions in the Borough 88 deaths from infective diseases occurred of persons belonging thereto, 47 in the Fever Hospitals, at Tooting, five from Measles, nine from Scarlet Fever, nine from Whooping Cough, 20 from Diphtheria, one from Cerebro-spinal Fever, and three from Tuberculous diseases; 32 in the Tooting Home, all from Tuberculous diseases; one in the Hostel of God from Tuberculous disease; one in the Tooting Bee Asylum, and five in other places from Tuberculous diseases. Compared with 1910, this shows an increase of 42, chiefly from Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tuberculous diseases. The next Table shows the death-rates from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1911, as well as for the preceding 10 years, and the rates above or below the decennial average are also shown. 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate was thus 1.51 above the rate for 1910, and '46 above the decennial average. The rate in all the sub-districts was higher than in the previous year, and only in Putney was it lower than the decennial average. The lower rate in Putney was due to the fact that the epidemic of Measles which was present in the other sub-districts did not extend to Putney, only three deaths having occurred in that sub-district. Notification of Infectious Diseases. The total number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year is shown in Table II. of the Local Government Board's Tables.

Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been a decrease in the number of cases of all the notifiable diseases with the exception of Continued Fever, Puerperal Fever and Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, which show a slight increase. The total number of cases notified was 1,949 (411 in Clapham, 107 in Putney, 466 in Streatham, 303 in Tooting, and 662 in Wandsworth), compared with 1,232 in 1910, 1,657 in 1909. and 2,095 in 1908.

The greatest number of notifications were received from the St. James's Infirmary. Of the 21 cases of Ophthalmia Neoratorum notified 11 were from the Royal Eye Hospital. Vaccination. Table XXXV. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1910.

During the year 1910, of 6,878 children whose births were registered, 3,857 or 56.1 per cent, were successfully vaccinated, compared with 60.9 per cent, in 1909, 61.3 per cent, in 1908, 66.5 per cent, in 1907, 71.05 per cent, in 1906, and 74.6 per cent, in 1905. This is again a decided decrease compared with the five previous years. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and in the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1910, as well as for the 10 years 19001909. The average for the 10 years is also shown on this Table. Compared with 1909 there has been a decrease in the percentage of successfully vaccinated in all the sub-districts with the exception of Clapham. The greatest decrease occurred in Streatham, and the smallest in Putney, while in the whole Borough there has been a decrease of no less than 4.8 per cent. Compared with the decennial average there has been a decrease in all the sub-districts, the greatest decrease having been in Streatham, and the smallest in Putney. 427 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 6'2 compared with 5.9 in 1909, 67 in 1908, 6.6 in 1907, 8.1 in 1906, and 8.4 in 1905. Of the 2,594 infants remaining, 19 or 27 per cent, were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination; 1,003 or 14.5 Per cent, in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received; 405 or 5.8 per cent, had vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 940 or 13.6 per cent, as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for; while 227 or 3.3 per cent, remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 13.3 per cent, as removed, etc., in 1909, 13.6 in 1908, 13.4 in 1907, 101 in 1906, and 77 in 1905; and 3.3 remaining as unvaccinated in 1909, 1.5 in 1908, 4.4 in 1907, 3.1 in 1906, and 3.1 in 1905. There has been an increase of 3 in the percentages of cases removed, and of 37 in the number of certificates of conscientious objections received. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. If the total number of infants who died unvaccinated be deducted from the total number of births registered, then of 6,451, the remaining infants, 597 per cent, were successfully vaccinated, -compared with 64.7 in 1909, 65.7 in 1908, and 71.2 in 1907; 29 were insusceptible, compared with .42, .37, and .41; 6.2 per cent, were under certificate of postponement, compared with 7.0, 5.6. and 4.8; 15.5 per cent, in regard to whom certificates of conscientious objection had been obtained, compared with 11.5, 8.6, 4.4, 2.8, 2.2, and 2.1; leaving 18.1 per cent, unaccounted for as regards vaccination, compared with 15.8, 19.7, 19.1, 14.5, 11.8 and 13.1.

The low rate of successful vaccinations in Streatham is a disquieting fact, as well as the great increase in the number of certificates of conscientious objections received, not only in that sub-clistrict, but in the Borough generally. Fortunately, Small-pox was not introduced into the Borough during the year, but there is no doubt that if such does occur the spread of the disease will be difficult to arrest owing to the greater proportion of unprotected persons. 59 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board in his Report for 1910-11, in dealing with the question of the introduction of cases and the methods adopted to prevent these cases from causing an epidemic, makes the following remarks, "the success hitherto achieved, in many small outbreaks that have occurred, is remarkable; but the slowly diminishing protection of the population by vaccination is a necessary cause of disquietude for the future. This is especially the case in certain districts in which the proportion of unprotected children is becoming large." The following Table shows the percentage to total vaccinations of abstention from vaccination and acceptance of vaccination in the Borough, Metropolitan Unions, and England and Wales for the last 10 years. 6o Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Scarlet Fever. 869 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 687 in 1910, 987 in 1909, and 1,232 in 1908. 170 of these were in Clapham, 49 in Putney, 219 in Streatham, 125 in Tooting, and 306 in Wandsworth. 725 or 83.5 per cent, of these cases were removed to the hospital where nine died, and 144 or 16.5 per cent, were treated at home with one death. The total number of deaths was 10, of which one was in Clapham, two in Putney, four in Streatham, two in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth. The death-rate per 1,000 population was .03, compared with .04 in 1910. The percentage of cases removed to hospital, viz.: 83.5, is slightly lower than in 1910, when it was 84 per cent. The case mortality was 1.15 per cent., compared with 1.77 in 1910, 1.42 in 1909, and 1.7 in 1908, and is the lowest on record. The mortality among cases removed to hospital was 1.24 per cent., compared with 1.6 in 1910, and among those treated at home .69 per cent., compared with .57 in 1909. The mortality among the home-treated cases was thus much lower than among those cases treated in hospital. The following Table shows the rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year and the three previous years, as well as the corresponding rates for the whole of London.

Putney was the only sub-district in which the rate was lower than in 1910, but the rate for the whole of the Borough, although higher than in 1910, when it was exceptionally low, was lower than . in 1908 and 1909. In Clapham the greatest number of cases was notified in October and November, and the smallest in August. In Putney the greatest number of cases was notified in October and November, in Streatham in October, in Tooting in November, and in Wandsworth in November. The rate in Tooting was to some extent raised by the notification of cases from the Fever Hospitals. The total number of cases notified from these Institutions was 26, so that the rate, instead of being 3.64 would on that account be reduced to 2.87 in 1911 and 2.53 in 1910. In the whole Borough the greatest number of cases, viz.:— 122, was notified in November, and the smallest in August, viz.:— 36. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1911, and for the whole year. TABLE XXXIX. SubDistricts. January. February. March. April.

Scarlet Fever and Schools. The next Table shows the number of cases of Scarlet Fever for each month of the year among children in attendance at elementary and other schools for each sub-district, also the number for the whole Borough, the number of cases among persons not at school, the number attending schools outside the Borough, as well as the number of cases in which, as far as could be ascertained, the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever was incorrect. Of the total number of cases, viz.:—869, the diagnosis was incorrect in 50 or 57 per cent.; 488 or 56.2 per cent, were in attendance at schools in the Borough; 23 or 2.6 per cent, attended schools outside the Borough; while 308 or 35.5 per cent, did not attend school, being either above or under school age. The percentage of children attending school was as follows: in Clapham, 101 out of 170, or 59 per cent.; in Putney, 22 out of 49, or 45 per cent.; in Streatham, 118 out of 219, or 54 per cent.; in Tooting, 69 out of 99, or 68 per cent.; and in Wandsworth, 178 out of 306, or 58 per cent. The percentage of cases in the Borough in attendance at school was higher than in 1910, while in the sub-districts the percentage was higher in all with the exception of Streatham. The percentage in Tooting is calculated after deduction of the cases notified in Institutions in that sub-district. In Clapham the schools chiefly affected were Wirtemberg Street, in which 17 cases occurred, Cavendish Road with 14 cases, and Bonneville Road with 12 cases. Ten of the cases in Wirtemberg Street occurred in October. Considerable difficulty was experienced in ascertaining the cause of these cases, and it was not until the 14th of the month that a mild case was discovered, which in all probability was the cause of several of the other cases. This child had suffered from a slight sore throat about the 20th September, but it was not till desquamation was definite, about the14th October, that a diagnosis could be made. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In this school only two cases occurred in November, and none in December. The school was visited on the 16th October, and the names and addresses of all absentees obtained. Their homes were then visited so as to ascertain definitely the cause of absence and to secure at the earliest possible period the examination of the child by a medical man. In all cases this was obtained, and it was not till a medical certificate was sent to the school that the child was permitted to return. In all the schools in the Borough this method Was adopted, and although a considerable amount of extra work was thus created, yet in my opinion it was the means of lessening to a large extent the spread of the disease. In Putney, of the 22 cases, five were notified in October and nine in November, seven of these being in attendance at Hotham Road School, and five at private schools. In Streatham the schools chiefly affected were Eardley Road with 18 cases, and Welham Road with 14 cases, while 30 cases occurred among children attending private schools. In Tooting, Ensham Street with 21 cases, and Sellincourt Road with 17 cases were the schools chiefly affected. 14 of the 21 cases in Ensham Street School occurred during the last four months of the year. In Wandsworth, Swaffield Road with 30 cases, West Hill with 18 cases, the Wandle with 15 cases, and Brandlehow Road with 14 cases were the schools chiefly affected. The Medical Officer (Education Department) of the London County Council excluded 45 children from 19 schools during the year, chiefly in October, November and December, until a medical certificate was received to the effect that the child was free from infectious disease. It was necessary to carry out disinfection in only four of the affected schools during the year after Scarlet Fever, but in all these cases the disinfection was carried out without closing the schools. 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Diphtheria and Enteric Fever notified, as well as the total cases notified from these diseases during each week of the year 1911. 6 7 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Chart (facing page 66) shows the number of cases notified in each week during the year. The greatest number, viz. 38, was notified in the second week of November, and the smallest, three, in the third week of August. Of the total number of cases notified, viz. :—869, four or .46 per cent, were under one year, compared with one or .14 per cent, in 1910 ; 201 or 23.1 per cent, were from one to five years, compared with 174 or 25.3 per cent. ; 566 or 65.1 per cent, from five to 15 years, compared with 422 or 61.4 per cent. ; 61 or 7.0 per cent, from 15 to 25 years, compared with 57 or 8.3 per cent. ; and 37 or 4.2 per cent, from 25 to 65 years, compared with 33 or 4.8 per cent. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during the year shows a considerable increase compared with the previous year, and is slightly above the average number for the last 10 years. The following Table shows the number of cases notified, the number of deaths that occurred in the separate sub-districts and in the whole Borough for the years 1901-1910 inclusive, the average for the 10 years, and the number of cases and deaths in 1911. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of cases notified was 510 (110 in Clapham, 34 in Putney, 111 in Streatham, 106 in Tooting, and 149 in Wandsworth), compared with 284 in 1910, 380 in 1909, and 581 in 1908. This number was 66 under the corrected, and 16 above the uncorrected decennial average. In all the sub-districts there has been an increase compared with 1910, in Clapham of 61, in Putney of 18, in Streatham of 26, in Tooting of 43, and in Wandsworth of 78. The greatest number of cases occurred in Wandsworth, and the smallest in Putney. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was i'65, compared with .95 in 1910, 1.35 in 1909, 2.11 in 1908, and 235 in 1907, and in London 17, compared with 1.13, 1.38, 1.64, 1.65 and 170. 428 or 84 per cent, of the cases were removed to hospital where 25 died, and 82 or 16 per cent, were treated at home with nine deaths. The case mortality was 6.6 per cent., compared with 5.6 in 1910, 7.6 in 1909, 6.3 in 1908, 6.3 in 1907, 8.9 in 1906, 8.9 in 1905, and 10.8 in 1904. The case mortality for the whole of London for the year 1911 was 83 per cent., compared with 7.9 in 1910, 9.1 in 1909, 9.2 in 1908, 8.89 in 1907, 87 in 1906, and 8.5 in 1905. The case mortality among cases treated in hospital was 5.8 per cent., and among those treated at home 11 per cent. The following Table shows the number of cases, the case-rate per 1,000 living, for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The highest case-rate was in Tooting, and the lowest in Streatham. The case-rate for the Borough is the same as that for the whole of London, but the death-rate is .04 per 1,000 lower. The death-rate per 1,000 in the Borough was .11, compared with .05 in 1910, .08 in 1909, .11 in 1908, and .15 the decennial average. In Clapham the death-rate was .17, in Putney .03, in Streatham .03, in Tooting .26, and in Wandsworth .12 per 1,000. 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. All the sub-districts show an increase compared with the previous year The Chart (facing page 66) shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases, viz. :—23, was notified in the second week of November, and the minimum, viz. :—one, in the fourth week of September. Although the number of cases of this disease was considerably larger than in 1910, yet it did not take an epidemic form owing to the means adopted for dealing with the cases in schools. During the months of October, November and December, when the cases suddenly increased in number, some anxiety was felt and extra precautions were taken to prevent the attendance at school of children suffering from sore throat. The occurrence of sore throat was reported to me by the teachers of the elementary schools, and I am confident that without the cordial co-operation extended to me by them it is quite possible that the disease might have assumed an epidemic and more virulent form. Diphtheria and School Attendance. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relationship to the schools in the Borough :— 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In Clapham, out of a total of no cases, 46 or 42 per cent, occurred in children attending school ; in Putney, of 34 cases, 17 or 50 per cent. ; in Streatham, of in cases, 55 or 50 per cent ; in Tooting, of 106 cases, 41 or 387 per cent. ; in Wandsworth, of 149 cases, 65 or 437 per cent. ; and in the whole Borough, of 510 cases, 224 were in attendance at schools in the Borough, and 12 at schools outside the Borough, a total of 236, or 46.2 per cent. Of the remaining cases, viz. :—274, in 42 or 8 per cent., the diagnosis was incorrect, and 232 or 45.5 per cent, were not in attendance at school. In Clapham the number of cases of Diphtheria in attendance at school was 46, the greatest number occurring in Haselrigge Road School and the next in Wirtemberg Street School. Five of the cases in Haselrigge Road occurred in October and three in August, while in the other schools in Clapham the cases occurred sporadically during the year. In Putney four cases occurred in Hotham Road and four in Walkers Place Schools, but in five months of the year in Putney no cases were notified among children attending school. In Streatham, Welham Road with eight cases and Broadwater Road with eight cases were the highest. Three of the cases in the former school occurred in July, and three in the latter school in February. The sub-district of Tooting was not so free from Diphtheria as in the previous year. 10 cases occurred in Franciscan Road, four of these in July. Ensham Street and Sellincourt Road Schools had seven cases each, but in neither school was any particular class-room involved. In Wandsworth there were 65 cases, and these occurred mainly in the last three months of the year. In five of the schools only one case occurred in each, in three two cases, in one three cases, in one four cases, in one five cases, in two six cases in each, in one eight cases, in one 13 cases, and eight cases occurred in the various private schools. 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The principal school affected in Wandsworth was Swaffield Road, where 13 cases occurred, five in October, and five in November. Three of the cases in October occurred in one house. Extended experience in dealing with small outbreaks, such as occurred in this last school, emphasises the urgent necessity of swabbing the throats of suspicious cases. In several instances no diagnosis could possibly have been made from clinical symptoms alone, and it was only after careful swabbing, not only of the throat but also of the nasal passages, that the carrier cases causing the extension of the disease could be discovered. Of the total number of cases notified 42 were incorrectly diagnosed, compared with 39 in 1910, leaving a total of 468 actual cases, compared with 245 in 1910, and 335 in 1909. No cases of Diphtheria were notified as having occurred in children attending the following elementary schools in the Borough :— In Clapham :— Aristotle Road. Bonneville Road. Christchurch. New Park Road. New Road. St. Mary's, Clapham Park Road. In Putney :— National School, Roehampton. In Streatham :— Christchurch. Hitherfield Road. Roman Catholic, Nightingale Square. St. Andrews, Polworth Road. In Wandsworth :— Roman Catholic, North Side, Wandsworth Common. St. Michael's. St. Thomas's. In all, 14 schools remained free from Diphtheria, compared with .24 in 1910. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria, six or 1.2 per cent, occurred among children under one year, 146 or 28.6 per cent, among children from one to five years, 276 or 54.1 per cent, from five to 15 years, 43 or 8.4 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, and 39 or 77 per cent. from 25 to 65 years. Compared with the previous year there has been an increase at five to 15 years, and at 25 to 65 years. Of the 428 cases of Diphtheria removed to Hospital 42 were reported not to have suffered from Diphtheria. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 52 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 40 in 1910, 46 in 1909, 57 in 1908, and 41 in 1907. There were also two cases of Diphtheria, compared with onein 1910, four in 1909, 17 in 1908, and one in 1907. 12 of the return cases occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, eight in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth. One of the return cases of Diphtheria occurred in Clapham, and the other in Streatham. The following Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent case, and the number of days elapsing between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. The average number of days the cases of Scarlet Fever were in hospital was 69.9, compared with 65.25 in 1910, and in thecases of Diphtheria 70 days, compared with 31 in 1910. In 12 premises more than one case occurred after the return of a case from hospital, five cases in one premises, four cases each in three premises, and two cases each in six premises. In five of the cases complaint was made that the patientssuffered from nasal discharge. 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XLIV. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever. Sue-District.

The total number of deaths was nine (three in Clapham, none in Putney, two in Streatham, none in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth), compared with eight in 1910, six in 1909, seven in 1908, 10 in 1907, and 15 in 1906. The number of deaths was one more than in 1910, but 6.4 under the decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .18, compared with .18 in 1910, .22 in 1909, .21 in 1908, and with •22 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from Fever was .03 per 1,000, compared with .02 in 1910, .02 in 1909, and .02 in 1908, while the rate for the whole of London was .03, compared with .04 in 1910, .03 in 1909, and .04 in 1908. Of the 42 cases removed to hospital, eight or 19.04 per cent, were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever, compared with 29 per cent. in 1910. The Chart (facing page 66), shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. In 16 of the weeks during the year no cases were notified, one case each in 21 of the weeks, two cases each in nine of the weeks, three cases each in five of the weeks, and four cases in one of the weeks. The maximum number of cases, viz. :—Four, was. notified in the third week of November. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health Of the 58 cases notified 10 were not Enteric Fever, four occurred in H.M. Prison, leaving 44 cases in which special enquiries were made as to the probable cause of the disease. In eight of the cases the disease was probably contracted by eating shell-fish, in 15 it was contracted outside the Borough (four in Ramsgate, three in South Africa, two in Brighton, and one each in Paris, Leeds, Bognor, Devonport, Broadstairs, and Northampton), in one the infection was contracted from a previous case in the same house, in three probably from watercress, while in 17 no history of infection could be ascertained. With regard to the eight cases caused by shell-fish, two were from oysters, three from mussels, two from winkles, and one from cockles. In the cases contracted outside the Borough, 15 in number, it was impossible to ascertain the exact source of infection, but in four of the cases it was probably from infected shell-fish, making a total of 12 altogether in which shell-fish were suspected. One of the cases contracted outside the Borough was infected by a carrier case at Brighton. Of the total number of cases, viz. :—12, infected in all probability by eating shell-fish, two died, while in the case of the other seven deaths no definite history of infection could be ascertained. Of the 10 cases which were not Enteric Fever, two were fatal, one from Tubercular Meningitis, and the other from Peritonitis. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 102 cases (50 of Scarlet Fever, 42 of Diphtheria, nine of Enteric Fever, and one of Cerebro-spinal Fever) information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's and other hospitals. that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease, compared with 107 in 1910, 112 in 1909, and 110 in 1908. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 81 Of the 1,199 cases removed to hospital, in 102 or 8.5 per cent. the diagnosis was incorrect, compared with 12.6 per cent. in 1910, 9.5 per cent. in 1909, and 6.9 per cent. in 1908. There has been a marked decrease in the percentage of incorrect diagnosis compared with 1910. TABLE XLVI. Disease. No. of cases of mistaken diagnosis. Total. Total cases removed.

Cerebro-spinal Fever. Five cases of Cerebro-spinal Fever were notified during the year (one from Clapham, one from Streatham, one from Tooting, and two from Wandsworth), compared with five in 1910. All the cases died, three from Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, one from Posterior-basic Meningitis, and one from acute Miliary Tuberculosis. C 2 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In London 101 cases of this disease were notified during the year, compared with 115 in 1910. 25 deaths were registered as having been caused by Meningitis (two in Clapham, two in Putney, six in Streatham, four in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth), compared with 19 in 1910. Five of these were of infants under one year, three from one to two years, three from two to five years, and 14 over 5 years. As in previous years., inquiries were made from the medical attendant, and in all the cases, with the exception of one, due to Posterior-basic Meningitis, the disease was stated to have been Simple Meningitis. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 624 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 318 in 1910, 397 in 1909, 491 in 1908, 466 in 1907, 407 in 1906, 174 in 1905, 121 in 1904, 125 in 1903, 98 in 1902, and 66 in 1901. The following Table shows the number of examinations in each sub-district and for the whole Borough, also the disease for which the examination was made and the result of such examination.

The great increase in the examinations for Diphtheria was due to the more general use of this means of diagnosis by the medical men in the Borough, as well as to the more rigid supervision of suspicious cases of sore throat reported from elementary schools. There is no doubt that these examinations were the means of checking outbreaks of Diphtheria which threatened several of the elementary schools during the year. Puerperal Fever. 24 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 20 in 1910, 26 in 1909, 14 in 1908, 25 in 1907, and 25 in 1906. Three cases occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, three in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 12 in Wandsworth. Eight of the cases (one in Clapham, two in Streatham, one in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth), or 33.3 per cent. were fatal, compared with 25 per cent. in 1910, 38.4 per cent. in 1909, 42 in 1908, 40 in 1907, and 44 in 1906. 15 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, where four died, and nine were treated at home with four deaths. The death-rate was .025 per 1,000, compared with .016 in 1910, and .034 in 1909. The case-rate per 1,000 births was 3.5 compared with 2.8 in 1910 and 3.7 in 1909, and for the whole of London 2.7, compared with 2.6. In four of the cases registered midwives only were employed, while six of the cases were miscarriages. 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Four nurses had free baths, and of the others, one came from Battersea, five were district or surgical nurses, and the remainder had baths at their own homes. In 19 cases the personal clothing of the nurse was disinfected. Erysipelas. 202 cases of Erysipelas were notified during the year and 10 deaths occurred. 42 of the cases and three of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 10 cases and no death in Putney, 42 cases and four deaths in Streatham, 22 cases and no death in Tooting, and 86 cases and three deaths in Wandsworth. In 1910 the number of cases notified was 182, and the deaths four. 45 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, where two died. Measles. During the year 230 deaths, 122 of males and 108 of females, were due to Measles, compared with 44 in 1910, 108 in 1909, 45 in 1908, 66 in 1907, and 65 in 1906. 27 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, three in Putney, 52 in Streatham, 44 in Tooting, and 104 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 186 more than in 1910, and I37.1 above the corrected decennial average. 41 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 80 from one to two years, 76 from two to five years, 32 from five to 15 years, and one from 15 to 25 years ; 85.6 per cent, of the deaths having occurred under five years of age. The death-rate was .74 per 1,000, compared with .14 in 1910, .37 in 1909, .15 in 1908, .24 in 1907, and .24 in 1906. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 85 The death-rate for the whole of London was .56 compared with .40 in 1910, for England and Wales .36, and for the 77 Great Towns .47 per 1,000. For the past 10 years Measles has been of a comparatively mild type, and with the exception of the years 1903, 1904, and 1909, the number of deaths did not exceed 100. At the close of 1910 it was observed that the number of cases was increasing, especially in Clapham and Putney. In the latter sub-district the outbreak did not become extensive, the total number of cases notified from schools amounting only to 74. In the other sub-districts, however, the number of cases increased rapidly and for the first four months of the year thesanitary staff was exceptionally busy in visiting the houses in which cases occurred, as will be seen from the statement of the number of these visits made. During the year 4,136 visits were made in cases of this disease (compared with only 957 in 1910), 571 in Clapham, 99 in Putney, 1,152 in Streatham, 781 in Tooting, and 1,593 in Wandsworth. Table XLVIII. shows the number of cases of notifiable and non-notifiable diseases notified by the teachers of the elementary schools in the Borough. In all, 6,785 cases were notified, compared with 4,617 in 1910, and 4,342 in 1909. 3,617 of these were cases of Measles, 591 of Chicken-pox, 565 of Whooping Cough, 674 of Mumps, and 412 of Ringworm. There was a large increase in the number of cases of Measles, and a decrease in the number of cases of Chicken-pox, Whooping Cough, Mumps and Ringworm. With regard to Measles, 534 cases were notified from schools in Clapham, 74 in Putney, 983 in Streatham, 573 in Tooting, and 1,453 in Wandsworth. 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The schools chiefly affected were, in Clapham, Bonneville Rood, Cavendish Road and Telferscot Road ; in Putney, Hotham Road ; in Streatham, Mitcham Lane, Smallwood Road, and' Eardley Road; in Tooting, Franciscan Road, Ensham Street, Sellincourt Road and Fountain Road ; and in Wandsworth, Swaffield Road, Waldron Road, Elliott Central, Wandle, Garratt Lane and Earlsfield. Very few of the schools were free from the disease, ard from information received from private individuals and medical men it was ascertained that in most of the private schools cases had occurred. The means adopted for the prevention of the spread of the disease were exclusion from school, education of the parents of children where cases had occurred by means of the pamphlet published in last year's Report, and disinfection of the premises after cases had recovered. As far as could be ascertained from the notifications received from the elementary schools, the disease first showed in epidemic form in the month of January in Telferscot Road School, and next in Cavendish Road School. These schools, although in Clapham, yet draw a large proportion of their children from Balham. The disease then spread to Tooting and Wandsworth, next to Streatham, Putney remaining comparatively free. The Education Department of the London County Council were at the same time informed by the teachers, and Table XLIX. shuws the schools in which it was thought necessary to exclude infants in attendance. It will be seen from this Table, as well as from the Table of the number of disinfections carried out, that the disease was most prevalent in February and March, and as in these months the climatic conditions are such as to favour the occurrence of the more fatal complications of Measles, the case mortality was exceptionally heavy. In nearly all the cases Bronchitis or Pneumonia was given as the secondary cause of death. 87 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL VIII. School. Diseases. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria.

The total number of premises disinfected was 2,638 (303 in Clapham, 59 in Putney, 711 in Streatham, 418 in Tooting, and 1,147 in Wandsworth), compared with 418 in 1910, 1,012 in 1909, 884 in 1908, 955 in 1907, and 902 in 1906. The greatest number of disinfections was carried out in March, this being due to outbreaks in Clapham, Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth. The greatest number of cases occurred in February, March and April. In August, September, October, November and December the number of disinfections was small as there were very few cases in any part of the Borough. 93 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate was .21 per 1,000, compared with .22 in 1910, .23 in 1909, and .23 for the whole of London in 1911. This disease was slightly less fatal in London and in this Borough in the year 1911 than in the two previous years. In the sub-district of Wandsworth it was more prevalent than in the other sub-districts The number of cases notified from schools was 565, compared with 919 in 1910, 538 in 1909, and 612 in 1908, 232 of these being from schools in the sub-district of Wandsworth, the schools chiefly affected in that sub-district being The Wandle and Earlsfield, and Streatham, where the schools chiefly affected were Mitcham Lane and Hitherfield Road. 94 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There were also 70 cases notified from schools in Clapham. the schools chiefly affected having been New Park Road and St. Andrew's Street. In Putney the school chiefly affected was All Saints', and in Tooting, Franciscan Road and Tooting Graveney. The greatest mortality from Whooping Cough occurs among children under five years of age. Of the 66 deaths that occurred from this disease, 64 or 97 per cent. were deaths of children under five years. The pamphlet, published in last year's Report, was left at every house where a case of Whooping Cough had been notified from school, and also in all other known cases. During the year 446 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Whooping Cough, 37 in Clapham, 3S in Putney, 121 in Streatham, 91 in Tooting, and 159 in Wandsworth. Other Diseases Notified from Schools. In addition to the 3,617 cases of Measles and 565 of Whooping Cough notified by the teachers of elementary schools, there were also notified 591 cases of Chicken-pox, 674 of Mumps, 412 of Ringworm, 76 of German Measles, 68 of inflammation of eyes, 52 of suspicious sore throat, and 118 of other diseases. No action is at present taken by the Sanitary Authority after notification of these diseases, although all the cases of suspicious sore throats were visited, so as to exclude the possibility of any of the cases being Diphtheria. In one of the schools in Clapham several cases of Impetigo occurred, and these were excluded until they had recovered. Chicken-pox was most prevalent in Streatham and Wandsworth, Mumps in Clapham and Streatham, and Ringworm in Streatham and Wandsworth. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 95 Disinfection of Schools During the year the following schools were disinfected on account of the prevalence of Measles, Scarlet Fever, or Diphtheria. (1.)

Epidemic Influenza. 24 deaths, 12 of males and 12 of females, were due to this disease, compared with 55 in 1910, 89 in 1909, 82 in 1908, 88 in 1907, and 70 in 1906. There has thus been the large decrease of 31 deaths compared with the previous year, and also compared with the corrected decennial average. Four of the deaths occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, 10 in Streatham, one in Tooting, and eight in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .08 per 1,000, compared with .18 in 1910, .30 in 1909, .28 in 1908, .32 in 1907, and .26 in 1906. 10 of the deaths were of persons from 25 to 65 years, and 10 of persons over 65 years. Diarrhoea. 350 deaths, 173 of males and 177 of females, occurred from all forms of Diarrhoea and Enteritis during the year, compared with 88 in 1910, 120 in 1909, 183 in 1908, 127 in 1907, and 307 in 1906. There has thus been an increase of 262 in the number of deaths from these diseases compared with the previous year, and of 218 compared with the corrected decennial average. 67 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 28 in Putney, 79 in Streatham, 53 in Tooting, and 123 in Wandsworth. In all the sub-districts there was a very large increase compared with 1910 and previous years. The death-rate was 1.13 per 1,000, compared with .30 in 1910, .41 in 1909, .64 in 1908, .46 in 1907, and 1.15 in 1906. The total number of deaths of children under two years was 300, equal to a rate of .97 per 1,000, while the death-rate for the whole of London under two years was 1.17 per 1,000. The heavy mortality from this disease was not confined to this Borough, as will be seen from these rates. 97 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:—In Clapham 1.13, compared with .29 in 1910; in Putney .98, compared with .32; in Streatham .8o, compared with .17; in Tooting 1.53, com pared with .37; and in Wandsworth 1.36, compared with .38. Of the total number of deaths registered, 274 or 78 per cent. were of infants under one year, compared with 75 per cent. in 1910, 72 per cent. in 1909, 74 per cent. in 1908, and 78 per cent. in 1907. The following Table shows the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1911, and for the five previous years.

The proportion of deaths in this quarter to total deaths from Diarrhoea is greater than in any of the five previous years except in 1906. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis under one year represents 33 per cent. of the total mortality D 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. at that age, compared with 12 per cent. in 1910, 15 per cent. ir 1909, 19 per cent. in 1908, 13.8 per cent. in 1907, 33 per cent. in 1906, 21.1 per cent. in 1905, and 28.8 per cent. in 1904, so that the increase of the mortality under one year was due to the ircrease in the number of deaths of infants from the above causes. In the Chart which is this year inserted, the number of deaths and their relation to temperature and rainfall is graphically shown. It will be seen from these that in 1909 and 1910, when the temperature was below the average of the last 65 years in the three months, July, August and September, and when the rainfall was above the average, the number of deaths was small, whereas in 1911, when the temperature was much above the average and the rainfall below the average, the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis was large. In the Registrar General's Report it was stated that the heat of the month of August was without precedent in the records of the country, that with a few exceptions the rainfall was everywhere deficient, and that a great excess of sunshine was noticeable practically everywhere. In the month of September the Report states that the first 12 days of the month were marked by three touches of unusual warmth, and this is well seen in the Chart. The rainfall also in London was low, and bright sunshine was in excess of the average. The Chart shows that the greatest number of deaths occurred in August, and that on only one day during that month no death occurred. It can also be seen that only three deaths from Diarrhoea occurred in July 1909, three in July 1910, and 14 in July 1911; 15 in August 1909, eight in August 1910, and 130 in August 1911; 27 in September 1909, 14 in September 1910, and 53 in September 1911. These climatic conditions were most favourable to fly-life, and from inquiries made in August and September it was found that the house fly was present in very great numbers in all the sub-districts. During the three months frequent inspections Diarrhœa No. of Deaths. Temperature and Rainfall. July.

Uncovered dust bins and the strewing of house refuse on back yards are still common, and in hot weather this refuse is more suitable for the development of flies owing to the fact that fires are not so much used, the amount of ashes produced being lessened and the amount of decomposable organic matter increased. The more frequent removal of house refuse by the Saritary Authority in the months of July, August and September, is most desirable, and is a subject that might with advantage to the public health be considered by the Council. The whole tendency of modern sanitation has been in the past to insist on the removal of effete products more quickly. Human excreta and slop water are removed at once by the water carriage system. The time will I trust soon come when the public will insist on the removal of other waste products, such as stable manure, excreta of other animals, as well as house refuse and decomposing stable and trade refuse, by a method as rapid and as satisfactory. Another point noted in the inspection of houses in the localities where Diarrhoea was most prevalent was the necessity of having back yards paved with impervious material. In the large majority of cases these yards are not utilised as gardens, but as dumping places for all sorts of refuse, and as suitable spots for the erection of small wooden sheds for keeping domestic animals. Great difficulty is experienced in dealing with the question of keeping domestic animals and I have personally made a considerable number of inspections for the purpose of ascertaining whether these are kept so as to be a nuisance. As will be seen in a later part of this Report a very large amount of work has been done in having yards properly paved, and in doirg away with nuisances arising from the accumulations of decomposing refuse and the keeping of domestic animals, but here also the education of the public is essential. 99 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. were made of stables and places where horse manure was kept so as to secure its frequent removal, but the prevalence of flies will not be much lessened in hot weather until the public are better educated in the methods that should be used for the storage of house refuse.

In 121, or 50 per cent., cows' milk, either alone or with cordensed milk or farinaceous food, was given ; in 88 or 363 per cent., condensed milk only, or condensed milk and farinaceous food was given; while in six or 2.4 per cent, farinaceous or patent foods only was given. In 14 cases, from various causes, no information could be obtained. 101 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 256 cases inquired into, 31 were prematurely bom, and 17 were twin children, 13 had intestinal trouble from birth, nine were suffering from Rickets and Wasting, seven had Bronchitis and Pneumonia, four had Whooping Cough, seven had Congenital Defects, and seven had other diseases previous to the onset of the Diarrhcea. Two of the cases who were entirely breast fed probably contracted the disease from the mother while in another case a member of the family had been removed to hospital suffering from Enteric Fever when the infant was four days old. An inquest was necessary in one case and the father was committed to prison for six weeks for neglect. Of the 256 deaths, 54 occurred in Institutions outside the Borough. The next Table shows the result of the inquiries made after these deaths, arranged in Wards, and there is also shown the number of infants who had been previously visited, the number of illegitimate infants, and the social status of the parents. It may also be seen in the Table that 46 of the infants who died from Diarrhoea had been fed in accordance with the pamphlet left by the Inspectors, and also that of the total number of deaths in which information was obtained, viz. 242, 31 were prematurely born, 69 were delicate from birth, and 17 were twin children Of the 46 stated to have been fed in accordance with the instructions on the pamphlet, two were prematurely born, nine were delicate from birth, four suffered from Conger ital Defects, four from Marasmus, two from Whooping Cough, one from Bronchitis, and two from other diseases. Infant Visiting. During the year the female Sanitary Inspectors have continued the work begun in 1905. in visiting the homes where births had occurred, and they have also had during the year, as is stated in their report, valuable assistance from several voluntary health visitors. 102 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Herewith we submit to you the report of our work among infants for the past year. "We had the help of nine voluntary workers, but only five worked for any length of time, and we have been able with their assistance to visit among the poorer families in each Ward of the Borough, details of which are shown in the subjoined Tables. "The total number of visits paid, including re-visits and ineffectual visits was 6,974, the ineffectual visits totalling 1,526, so many having removed previous to the second visit. "The number of ineffectual calls was highest in Southfield, the reason being that many of the young mothers take their children out as much as possible. "The total number of visits paid after notification and registration of births will be found in Table LIV., which also shows the method of feeding at the first visit, and the number of ineffectual calls. "The Notification of Births Act, which came into force in this Borough in November, 1909, has enabled us to visit infants earlier than formerly. "Nearly all the births in Springfield Ward were attended by midwives, and the notifications in this Ward were very nearly as numerous as the births registered. "150 of the infants visited died during the year, their ages in months at death being shown in Table LVI. "It will be noticed that the heaviest mortality occurred in Springfield, where the deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis alone numbered 19. The previous year also the deaths in this Ward were the most numerous, then the causes were mainly Bronchitis and Pneumonia. 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The majority of the deaths occur in the streets and roads adjoining the Wandle, in 1911 especially the houses were infested with flies throughout the greater part of the year. "86 deaths occurred among infants previously visited by us in 1911, as compared with 19 in the previous year, this shows a percentage of 33.5 as compared with 29 .8. "The next most fatal complaints were Bronchitis and Pneumonia, 22 irfants dying of these, and six of Whooping Cough. 10 infants died of Marasmus, and seven of Congenital Debility and Inanition, five died of Convulsions, four of Tubercular Meningitis, two were suffocated, and two were premature. There was one death from each of the following diseases, Anæmia, Jaundice, Hydrocephalus, Congenital Syphilis, and Heart Failure, while the death of one was registered as caused by Debility from birth, Excessive Heat, the child being taken ill and dying the same day. "Of the 3,518 irfants visited, 127 were premature, and of these 17 died, and 46 were delicate from birth, 19 of whom died, six of these being twins. *• "We have found it exceedingly difficult to trace the illegitimate births registered, especially in the case of the Workhouse births where the address of the house at which the expectant mother had lodged for a short time before entering the Workhouse is often given, or in other cases, the address of the home, or of a member of the family who repudiates any connection with the mother, and assures us that she will not return to that address on leaving the Workhouse. Five wrong addresses were giver, 13 removed almost immediately after confinement, (two of these came here for confinement only), and 10 irfants we found had died previous to our first visit. "No information could be obtained about five infants, and 28 were put to nurse immediately after birth, while five of thoseborn in the Workhouse remained there. 105 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "Of the 117 illegitimate infants visited, 27 were removed and could not be traced as the particular guardians had removed when re-visited, while 16 mothers came into the Borough only to be confined, the majority of these cases being in Tooting. Of those mothers from whom we could not get any information, 31 were not natives of this Borough. "At the first visit 69 infants were wholly breast-fed, but of the 48 re-visited only 12 were so fed. "20 of those visited died, 10 from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, three from Marasmus, three from Inanitior, three from Pneumoria, and two from Whooping Cough. "Table LV. shows the number of re-visits, and the method of feeding then found, the average age at the second visit being from four to five months. "The proportion of infants entirely breast-fed on the first visit is somewhat higher than in the previous year, being 81.6 per cent, as against 79.8 per cent, in 1910. The number of those having milk or food in addition is very nearly the same, the proportion of those being fed on breast and cows' milk showing a percentage of 43, this being the same as 1910, those fed on cows' milk alone were 30 per cent, as compared with 33 per cent, in 1910, and those fed on condensed milk 15 per cent., compared with 17 per cent, in 1910. "On our second visit we again found a slight increase in the proportion of those wholly breast-fed, the percentage being 63, compared with 62 in 1910. We also noted a decrease in the use of farinaceous foods, while the proportion of those fed on cows' milk and condensed milk is almost the same as in 1910. "The pamphlet that we distribute containing advice on the feeding of infants has been much appreciated by many mothers, in some instances we have found it has been treasured from the first year in which we visited the mother, and was being used for the second or third baby. 321 mothers told us that they were following the instructions contained in it . 106 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "We found in the case of infants that were being fed by hand that 664 mothers were using the boat shaped bottles. Both boat and tube bottles were in use in 30 instances, and in 59 cases the infant was fed by a spoon. "On our second visit 32 tube bottles had beer discarded and boat bottles were then being used. "In our talks with the mothers, we have specially pointed out to them the dangers arising from the use of "comforters" or "dummies." We were glad to find that a great many mothers were aware of these dangers and were not giving the dummy to the child, but in many instances it is looked on as the universal pacifier, or as the medium by which the baby takes its medicine. We have often found a child of two or three years still sucking at a dummy and refusing to give up the use of it. "1,075 mothers were wise enough not to begin the use of the 'comforter,' but 2,443 were giving it, though more than half of this number assured us 'it was only occasionally given.' In 253 instances the mothers had discontinued its use altogether on our second visit. "With regard to the employment of midwives, out of 3,518 mothers visited 1,215 availed themselves of their services. Of these 1,170 employed midwives registered under the London County Council and 45 had non-registered midwives. Any cases of infringement of the Midwives Act discovered by us we have at once reported to you. The sanitary defects found in the course of our work were remedied, or if requiring structural work, referred to you. "138 intimation notices were served, and five statutory notices were required." io7 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LIV. INFANTS VISITED. Clapham, North. Clapham, South. Putney.

In all 3,518 infants were visited, compared with 3,448 in 1910, and 2,269 in 1909. It is satisfactory to observe that with the assistance of the voluntary workers, infants were visited in all the Wards of the Borough. The total number of deaths among those visited was 150, 18 in Clapham, 20 in Putney, 21 in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 70 in Wandsworth. Table LVI. shows these deaths arranged in monthly age periods. The heaviest mortality occurred at three to four months, while no deaths occurred at 10 to 11 months. The increase in the deaths, compared with previous years, was due to the increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis. It is a most significant fact that the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis among 2,880 infants who were breastfed was only four, or a percentage mortality of "14, while among 638 infants who were otherwise fed the number of deaths was 82 or a percentage mortality of 13. The mortality among infants otherwise fed was thus 93 times greater than those breast-fed. The mortality among the infants visited by the Inspectors was only 43 per 1,000, compared with 122 per 1,000 the rate for the Borough for the year. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

With regard to Tuberculous disease of the Lungs, the rates for Clapham and Streatham were above, and those for Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth under last year's rates. From other Tuberculous diseases the rate was .o6 higher than in 1910. This rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, and the rate for Tuberculous disease of the lungs was lowest in Putney and highest in Clapham. 112 Report oj the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tuberculous disease of the Lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year, as well as for the preceding 10 years.

Compared with the decennial average the rate was somewhat lower in the whole Borough, but the sub-districts of Clapham and Streatham have an ircreased rate compared with that average, while Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth are lower, the last subdistrict showing a most satisfactory reduction of 34 per 100,000. The rate in Clapham for 1911 is higher than it has been since 1904, and in Streatham it was only once exceeded in the previous 10 years, viz.—in 1908. In Tooting the rate is lower than it has been since 1902, and in Wandsworth it is the lowest ever recorded. This last sub-district has always had a higher average mortality from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and it is satisfactory to observe jliat in 1911 the reduction has been so great. 113 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Three deaths from Tuberculous disease of the Lungs occurred in infants under one year, three in persons from one to two years, one from two to five years, three from five to 15 years, 45 from 15 to 25 years, 128 from 25 to 45 years, 76 from 45 to 65 years, and 21 over 65 years. From other Tuberculous diseases 20 deaths occurred under one year, 12 from one to two years, 21 from two to five years, 21 from five to 15 years, 13 from 15 to 25 years, 11 from 25 to 45 years, nine from 45 to 65 years, and two over 65 years.

Of the total number of males who died, viz. : 157, the occupation of 144 is given, five were children, and eight werfc stated to have had no occupation. As was the case in previous years, clerks and labourers head the list, the numbers being respectively 19 and 19. Among females, of 123 deaths only 23 were engaged in some occupation, nine being domestic servants, five were dressmakers, two clerks, and two teachers. 17 of the 123 females had been widows, wives or daughters of artisans, 24 of the labouring classes, 38 of clei ks, tradesmen, four were children, and 17 had no .occupation. The next Table shows the deaths and death rates in males and females from Tuberculous disease of the Lungs, and for other Tuberculous diseases, as well as the deaths and death-rates among children under five years from other Tuberculous diseases, for the 10 years 1901-1910, and for the year 1911. This Table has been fully corrected by the Census of 1911. Among males the rate for Tuberculous disease of the Lungs for the year 1911 was '98 compared with 1*23 the decennial average ; and among females 72 compared with 77, while from other Tuberculous diseases the rate among males was 41 compared with '43 ; and among females .30 compared with .33. Among children under five years the rate for the year was .17, compared with .24, the decennial average. The rate for males and females for the year 1911 from Tuberculous disease of the Lungs was .91, compared with .98 the decennial average. In two of the years during the decennium, viz. : in 1910 and 1902 this rate was lower, while in the other years of the decennium it was higher. ii7 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LX.

The Chart shows the male and female as well as the total death-rate from Pulmonary Tuberculosis per 10,000 population for the last 25 years. As will be seen the rate in both males and females has decreased to some extent. The rate among males was lowest in 1910 and among females in 1902. In the Report for 1910 the methods which had been adopted by some authorities were given, but since then the subject of the control of Pulmonary Tuberculosis has been widely discussed, not only in medical journals, but also in the lay press. The education of the public which has been going on for some years has borne some fruit in the establishment of societies for dealing with the question. The medical profession in the Borough, as represented by the South West London Medical Society and the Wandsworth Division of the British Medical Association, formed a joint Committee which met several times for the purpose of formulating a scheme to lay before the Council. Two schemes were eventually formulated, in one of which the Local Authority were to have the control, and the other, a voluntary scheme controlled by a central body in London, and in which the Local Authority would as such have no control. The joint Committee favoured the former scheme, but both were printed and circulated to members of the Council. A deputation from the above mentioned bodies came before the Council to support the scheme, and eventually it was referred to the Public Health Committee. Previous to this the Public Health Committee had the matter under consideration, and the following report was made to the Council on the 26th July :— "(a) We have had under consideration the subject of the establishment of a dispensary for the treatment of patients suffering from Tuberculosis. We have considered the report of the Paddington Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption, which was Death-rate per 100,000 from Tuberculosis of the Lungs from 1887 to 1911 inciusive. 119 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. opened in January, 1909, 877 persons being treated in the first year; the report of the Medical Officer of Health, Portsmouth, on Tuberculin dispensaries ; and the report of the Medical Officer of Health, London County Council, as to the action taken by the London Sanitary Authorities with regard to cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. "(b) In 1903 the Council adopted a system of voluntary notification of the disease; cases coming under the Poor Law authorities have been notified under an order of the Local Government Board since 1908, and the principle of compulsory notification of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis has, from the 1st of May, been extended to cases occurring amongst in-patients or out-patients at hospitals or other similar institutions for the treatment of the sick which are supported wholly or partially otherwise than by contributions of patients and otherwise than from rates and taxes. The Council, in March last, decided, in order that the matter might be more satisfactorily dealt with, to ask the London County Council to consider the advisability of adopting a system of compulsory notification of Tuberculosis within the County of London. (c) The total number of deaths from Tuberculosis in the Borough during the year 1910 was 264—49 in Clapham, 24 in Putney, 61 in Streatham, 35 in Tooting, and 95 in Wandsworth ; and the death-rate was .88 per 1,000—.84 in Clapham, .85 in Putney, .65 in Streatham, 109 in Tooting, and 108 in Wandsworth ;—the average for 10 years for the whole Borough (1900 to 1909) being .93. Although there has been a considerable decrease compared with the decennial average, yet we feel that further steps are necessary to lessen the mortality. "(d) At the present time over three hundred cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis are under the observation of the Public Health Department. There are also over two hundred cases at present under treatment at the various Poor Law institutions, and the annual cost is estimated at about £6,000, without taking into consideration the amount expended in outdoor and other relief to the dependents. 120 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "(e) We are strongly of opinion that something should be done with the view of assisting persons suffering from the disease. A Tuberculosis Dispensary, established by the Council, under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, on the lines of a similar institution recently established at Portsmouth, could be conducted at a cost of about £700 per annum ; and we understand that such an institution would receive the hearty support of the medical profession in the district. Patients in the early stages of Consumption could thus be treated while still following their occupations, and probably prevented from becoming chargeable to the rates. "(f) The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, in a memorandum on the administrative measures against Tuberculosis, states with regard to the Tuberculosis Dispensary 'The object of this institution is to secure early diagnosis for patients suspected to be suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and to direct their treatment in the light of knowledge not only of their medical, but also of their domestic and industrial needs. The ideal of the dispensary implies, therefore, a careful system of domicilary visitation and investigation.' "(g) We submit the following statement of the estimated cost of furnishing and fitting up a dispensary, and of the annual cost of maintenance:— Furnishing, fitt ng-up, apparatus, etc. £120 0 0 Maintenance— £ s. d. Salaries—Medical Officers £300 00 Nurse 75 0 0 Caretaker 50 0 0 ———- 425 00 Rent 45 00 Rates, Taxes, Water, etc. 20 0 0 Coal and Gas 10 0 0 Drags, including Tuberculin 200 0 0 £700 0 0 121 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "2.We recommend that a dispensary for the treatment of Tuberculous patients be established by the Council, and be under the control of the Medical Officer of Health." The above report was referred back to the Committee with the view of further information on the subject being supplied to members of the Council. This report was again brought before the Council on the 4th October, but it was again rendered back to the Committee for further consideration. On the instructions of the Committee the following report was made and sent to all members of the Council. After a recapitulation of the methods adopted by some Authorities which appeared in my Report for 1910 the report was as follows:— "II.—The Dispensary would be the centre where all the measures for the prevention and cure of the disease would be centralised. "III.—As has been stated by the late Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, in a preface to a report on Tuberculosis Sanatoria by Dr. Bulstrode, whatever be the precise value of sojourn in a sanatorium, there can be no question that the average of lasting benefit would be materially increased were a system of selection generally adopted for securing as inmates persons in the earlier phase of their malady. This want a Tuberculosis Dispensary would supply, but in addition it would enable the Authority to carry out more completely other measures for dealing with the disease. "IV.—The measures which are at present carried out are :— (1.) Notification. (2.) Visiting cases, leaving card of advice, and exercising a certain amount of supervision over those treated at home. 122 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (3.) Cleansing and disinfection of premises after death or removal. (4.) The provision of spit bottles. (5.) The examination of sputum. "V.—The other measures which would be carried out if the Dispensary were started would be:— (1.) The treatment by Tuberculin. (2.) The examination of contacts discovered after notified cases. (3.) Treatment and visiting at home of those cases not able to attend at the Dispensary. (4.) Organisation of voluntary associations, who would assist in procuring extra food, clothing, etc. (5.) Arranging for removal to Sanatoria of suitable cases. (6.) The provision of outdoor shelters. (7.) More thorough education of contacts and suspects in the methods of prevention. "VI.—The two points in the scheme which are of the greatest importance are the searching for and examination of contacts, ..and the treatment by Tuberculin. "VII.—The following is a detailed statement of the estimated cost of furnishing and fitting up a Dispensary, and the annual cost of maintenance:— Furnishing and fitting up rooms— Tables, chairs, linoleum, gas or electric light fittings, laboratory bench, and sink £40 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 123 Apparatus—including microscope weighing machine, laryngoscope, clinical thermometers, steriliser, hypodermic syringes, centifuge, incubator, and other bacteriological apparatus £80 £120 Maintenance— Salaries— Medical Officers,—3 at £100 £300 (Each Medical Officer would be in attendance two afternoons each week, and would also visit selected cases at home.) Nurse, appointed as Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor, at £120 to £150 per annum, part repayable by London County Council £75 Caretaker, also acting as porter and clerk (house, gas and coals provided) £50 Rent £45 Rates, Taxes, Water, etc. £20 Coals and gas £10 Drugs, including Tuberculin £200 £700 "VIII.—Duties of Medical Officers:— (1.) To attend at Dispensary at specified hours, for examination and treatment of cases. (2.) To visit selected cases at home unable to attend at Dispensary. (3.) To examine contacts sent to Dispensary. (4.) To make bacteriological examinations of sputum. (5.) To enter on forms details of examination and treatment. (6.) To prepare and forward fortnightly reports on prescribed forms to the Medical Officer of Health, for the information of the Council. 124 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "[IX.—Duties of Nurse:— (1.) To attend daily at Public Health Department, to see the Medical Officer of Health, and receive instructions with reference to notified cases. (2.) To attend daily at Dispensary, to render assistance to doctors. (3.) To visit such cases as are necessary, to fill in report sheets, leave the literature issued by the Council, and to give instruction to the patient or relatives. (4.) To prepare and forward fortnightly reports on prescribed forms to the Medical Officer of Health for the information of the Council. (5.) To note and report on any insanitary conditions in the homes visited." 23rd September, 1911. The Public Health Committee after further consideration reported again to the Council on the 15th November as follows "(1.) We have further considered the subject of the proposed establishment of a dispensary for the treatment of persons suffering from Tuberculosis, and we have again had under consideration the Order of the Local Government Board, dated 22nd March, 1911, extending the compulsory notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis to cases occurring amongst in-patients or out-patients at certain classes of hospitals or other similar institutions for the treatment of the sick. The letter of the Local Government Board accompanying the Order pointed out that Councils are empowered to provide hospitals for the treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and stated that the Board is advised that this power extends to the provision of dispensaries or hospitals for the treatment of outpatients. "(2.) After careful enquiry and full reconsideration of the proposals submitted to the Council on the 4th October, and after .reading the latest report on the dispensary which is now being carried on at Portsmouth, we have to report that in our judgment the scheme recommended by us is at the present time sufficient. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 125 "(3.) With regard to the support which the proposed dispensary would receive from the medical profession, we have to report that the scheme recommended by us is in accordance with the views expressed by the deputation which waited upon the Council on the 26th July last. We also desire to point out that the dispensary would be entirely under the control of the Council. The medical profession have neither asked nor suggested that they should have any control over the scheme when in operation. "(4.) With regard to the cost of the proposed dispensary, having carefully reconsidered the subject, we submit the following amended estimate, in which some additions have been made to the amounts previously stated, viz. : Furnishing and fitting up rootns— Tables, chairs, linoleum, gas or electric light fittings, laboratory bench, and sink £40 Apparatus—including microscope, weighing machine, laryngoscope, clinical thermometers, steriliser, hypodermic syringes, centifuge, incubatoi\ and other bacteriological apparatus £80 £120 Maintenance— Salaries— Medical Officer (who would also act as Deputy Medical Officer of Health) £300 Xurse, appointed as Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor £120 Caretaker, also acting as porter and clerk (house, gas, and coals provided) £65 Rent £60 Rates, Taxes, Water, etc £25 Coals and Gas £10 Drugs, including Tuberculin £200 £780 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "(5-) With regard to the object of the proposed dispensary, we desire to state that it would not be solely a place where Tuberculin treatment is given, but would be the centre from which would radiate all the municipal measures in the Borough for the cure and prevention of consumption. "(6.) We beg to point out, however, that the scheme which we suggest is susceptible of extension, if the Council should so decide. "(7.) We also beg to report that if the Council should desire to add to the scheme the provision of beds in sanatoria, this t an be secured at Peppard or other sanatoria at a cost of 30s. per bed per week. "(8.) In conclusion we have to report that, after carefully reconsidering the whole subject, we endorse our previous report, and again recommend the Council to establish a dispensary, on the lines suggested, for the treatment of persons suffering from Tuberculosis, and that such dispensary be under the control of the Public Health Committee ; and that the matter be referred to us to take the necessary, steps to carry out." This report, after discussion by the Council, was withdrawn. Since the date of the last report I have again carefully studied the whole subject and I am decidedly of opinion that the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary on the lines suggested by the Public Health Committee would be the most satisfactory means of dealing with the question, as far as our present knowledge goes. Many other Authorities have quite recently established dispensaries on similar lines and others are considering the question, and if the Council is to do anything in the way of checking Tuberculosis no more satisfactory or economical scheme could, in my opinion, be adopted. It may with some reason be argued that the death-rate from Tuberculosis in the Borough is less compared with the rest of the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 127 Metropolis, but if the constitution of the population and the number of open spaces in the Borough be taken into consideration the rate should be lower than nearly all the other Metropolitan Boroughs. Again, the reduction in the mortality in the Borough, compared with the decennial average was only 7.4 per cent., while the reduction in the Metropolis was 13 per ccnt. In Edinburgh, according to the report of the Medical Officer of Health, the mortality had been reduced 45 per cent, during the last 20 years, this period corresponding almost exactly with the time the Tuberculosis Dispensary in that City has been in operation. The treatment by Tuberculin is now being tried in the majority of these dispensaries, but whether this will prove as satisfactory as the supporters of the treatment allege, cannot yet be definitely stated. As far as present experience goes the treatment is of great value in early cases, and I have from personal observation been able to verify this in a number of cases both in private practice and in dispensaries. Compared with London as a whole the mortality was "91 per 1,000 compared with 1.34, while the only other Boroughs with a lower rate were Hampstead with "61, and Lewisham with "64 per 1,000. Notification of Consumption under the Local Government Board's Order of December, 1908. 288 cases of Consumption were notified during the year, 42 of these belonging to Clapham, 16 to Putney, 41 to Streatham, 75 to Tooting, and 114 to Wandsworth, compared with 219 cases in iyio, and 317 in 1909. 128 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of these cases notified, and also the number of times they were notified:— TABLE LXI Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

This makes a total of 488 notifications for the 288 cases. The next Table shows the number of cases in the various sub-districts still on the Register at the close of 1909, the number of cases notified in 1910, and the number who died, recovered, removed, the number still in Institutions, and the number under observation.

In 1910 the number of cases in Institutions was 221 and at home nine, a total of 316. There has thus been in 1911 an increase of 164 cases compared with 1910. The next Table shows the number of Poor Law cases notified since 1909, the number dead, and the year in which death occurred, as well as the number of cases removed and recovered. E TABLE LXI11.

Of 317 cases notified in 1909, 84 died in that year, 27 in 1910, and 11 in 1911, while 146 cases were living at the end of 1911; of 219 cases notified in 1910, 60 died in that year and 23 in 1911, while 125 were living at the end of 1911 ; and of 288 cases notified in 1911, 75 died, leaving 209 alive at the end of the year. This makes a total of 480 cases as is shown in the previous Table. In all, 55 of the cases have removed and in most of these cases it was impossible to find their new residence. In a few cases this was ascertained and the names and addresses forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of the District. 117 discharge certificates were received, 111 on Form C from Superintending Officers, and six on Form D from Relieving Officers. Of the 117 certificates, 95 were received from Superintending Officers of the Wandsworth Union, six from Relieving Officers, six from Queen Mary's Hospital, Carshalton, two from the Croydon Union and one each from Isleworth, Holborn, Kingston, Hampstead, Richmond, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Grove Hospital, Tooting. Report of the Medical Officer of Health, 131 Of the 95 certificates from Superintending Officers in the Wandsworth Union, 52 were received from the Union Infirmary and 43 from the Tooting Home. The 117 certificates received related to 108 cases, nine cases having been notified twice. e 19 cases were notified as having gone to addresses in Clapham, eight to Putney, 17 to Streatham, 15 to Tooting, and 49 to Wandsworth. Two cases in Streatham and eight in Wandsworth were discharged to Common Lodging Houses. Notification of Cases under Tuberculosis in Hospitals Regulations, 1911. The above regulations came into force on the 1st May, 1911, and applied to all hospitals, dispensaries, or similar Institutions for the treatment of the sick which is partially or wholly supported otherwise than by the contributions of the persons treated therein or of their relatives or guardians, and otherwise than from rates and taxes. In the year 1909, 1910, and up to the 1st May, 1911, however, several notifications had been received from hospitals, chiefly the Brompton Hospital, but such notifications were purely voluntary. During the eight months from the 1st May to the end of the year, 197 cases were notified, 47 relating to persons residing in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 41 in Streatham, 75 in Tooting, and 114 in Wandsworth. Up to the 1st May, eight cases were notified voluntarily making a total of 205 cases which came under the observation of this department. Of the 197 cases, one was under one year, two from one to five years, 17 from five to 15 years, 59 from 15 to 25 years, 95 from 25 to 45 years, 21 from 45 to 65 years, and two over 65 years. 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From the following Table it will be seen that 160 cases were notified once, 28 twice, eight three times, and one four times, making a total of 244 notifications received. 60 of the cases notified were received from Brompton Hospital, 30 from Mount Vernon Hospital, 15 from Battersea Dispensary, 11 from the Royal National Hospital for Consumption, St. Lawrence, nine from the National Sanatorium, Benenden, nine from the Brompton Sanatorium, Frimley, seven from Kennington Dispensary, seven from St. Thomas's Hospital, and the remainder from various Hospitals and Sanatoria in London and the provinces.

The next Table shows the number of cases notified voluntarily by medical practitioners in the Borough, corrected for transfers to Hospitals or Poor Law Institutions. During the year 42 cases of Phthisis were voluntarily notified, six belonging to Clapham, none to Putney, eight to Streatham, two to Tooting, and 26 to Wandsworth, compared with 75 in 1910, 74 in 1909, 85 in 1908, 49 in 1907, 74 in 1906, and 104 in 1905. Eight of these have been transferred to the Hospitals in Table LXV. as they had been notified before the 1st May. Of the 42 cases notified, six were notified from the Brompton Hospital, two from Westminster Hospital, and 34 were notified by private practitioners. 16 of the cases died, one of these having been notified in 1908, six in 1910, and nine in 1911.

At the end of the year, out of the 471 cases notified since 1904, 226 have died, 132 had removed, 20 were stated to have recovered, in 46 no inquiries were made, while 47 cases were left on the Register. Of the total number of cases notified, one was from one to five years, three from five to 15 years, 11 from 15 to 25 years, 16 from 25 to 45 years, 10 from 45 to 65 years and one over 65 years. The total number of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis alive at the close of the year was 734, 480 Poor Law cases, 207 Hospital cases, and 47 private cases. Table LXVII. is a combined Table and shows the total number of cases notified since 1904, with the number of deaths in each year. In all 1,565 cases have been notified, and of these 543 or 347 per cent, died, 209 or 133 per cent, have removed, 31 or 19 per cent, are stated to have recovered, in 48 or 31 per cent, no inquiries were made, while 734 or 47 per cent, are still on the Register.

These cases had been discovered in the examination of children at school. Of these 29, nine were in attendance at Brompton or other Hospitals, eight were stated to have recovered, six were still ill, and six had removed. '/ , The whole of the work in connection with these cases has been carried out by the female Sanitary Inspectors, and I am able to report that it was done in a most thorough and satisfactory manner. The total number of visits paid was 938, 180 in Clapham, 54 in Putney, 178 in Streatham, 148 in Tooting, and 378 in Wandsworth. As in previous years, the pamphlet which has been in use since 1903 was left, and the instructions thereon were in most of the cases carried out. As there are no Public Institutions in the Borough to which consumptive patients can be sent, the Inspectors have referred children to the Invalid Children's Association, and in the majority of cases they have been able to obtain convalescent treatment for them. Where great poverty existed in the house the Invalid Children's Aid Association was unable to give prolonged assistance, and in those instances the matter had to be referred to the Guardians. Certain adult cases were referred to the Charity Organisation Society, which has helped in giving Hospital Letters and convalescent treatment. 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 137 It is not possible with the present staff to do more than has been done in endeavouring to educate and assist these cases, but if a Dispensary were in operation the visiting nurse could undertake a large proportion of this work and so allow the Inspectors in this Department to devote more of their time to revisiting certain of the home treated cases, and to their other duties, viz. : the inspection of Factories and Workshops, and the visiting of infants. During the year 15 sputum bottles have been supplied, and two were returned after the death of the patient. Of 527 cases which were visited by the Inspectors, in 212 the information obtained was so indefinite that it was not possible to tabulate it, in the majority of the cases no family history being known. 24 cases were notified from the Workhouse, 18 from Tooting Bee Asylum, three from H.M. Prison, two from the Intermediate Schools, in two wrong addresses were given, seven had removed, in 35 the patients were either lodgers or domestic servants and the occupiers of the house could give no information, while in only two cases during the year were the Inspectors refused information. The Tables which follow have been drawn up by the London County Council in conjunction with the Society of Medical Officers of Health, so that a uniform Table for the whole of London could be prepared. In future years these Tables will be much more correct and consequently more valuable. 138 Report of the Medical Officer of Health TABLE LXV 111. MALES. Number of Cases, 121. Age Distribution.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health 145 The Tables dealing with ages, duration of illness and occupation are self explanatory, but the Tables dealing with personal and family history are more complicated and require some explanation. These Tables are to be read as follows:— In the Table dealing with males, at ages 35-55 years it will be seen that 33 cases were notified. Of these, 13 parents died from Consumption, three died from other diseases, while the history of 50 parents could not be ascertained. In the next two columns, under the head of brothers and sisters, it was ascertained that three brothers or sisters were alive suffering from the disease, while 20 had died. At these ages it will be noted in the next two columns that the wives of 29 were alive and well, while four were dead, but not of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, while of the patient's children three were alive suffering and four dead, while 98 were alive and not affected. At the other ages the Table is to be read in the same way. Among the total number of males, viz. : 121, five parents were alive but affected, while 43 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 87 parents were alive and not affected, while 11 had died, but not of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Among the total number of females, viz. : 101, five parents were alive but affected, while 25 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 76 parents were alive and not affected, while 20 had died, but not of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The following Table, required by the Local Government Board, is here inserted. e 2 146 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXIl. WANDSWORTH BOROUGH.

During the year disinfection was carried out at 313 premises either after the death or removal of the patient, compared with 265 in 1910, 255 in 1909, 184 in 1908, and 135 in 1907. 72 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 24 in Putney, 73 in Streatham, 40 in Tooting, and 104 in Wandsworth. Deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Public Institutions. The following Table shows the number of deaths and the rate to total deaths from this disease for the year 1911, and for the previous 10 years:— TABLE LXXIII. Year. Total Number of Deaths.

This Table shows that the rates for the present year are much higher than the average for the past 10 years. The rate in the Union Infirmaries shows an increase compared with the decennial average, and also compared with 1910, and the rate in the General and Special Hospitals has also increased. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 170 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute: 18 from Clapham, 12 from Putney, 66 from Streatham, 10 from Tooting, 64 from Wandsworth. In 42 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had Becn found, and in 128 that it was absent. Other Septic Diseases. 21 deaths were caused by other Septic diseases, three in Clapham, two in Putney, five in Streatham, four in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. Of these 13 were stated to have Becn due to Syphilis, seven 'to Septicemia, and one to Tetanus. The following Table shows the death-rate from Infective diseases for the whole Borough for the year, as well as for the five previous years. 149 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXIV.

On the 1st September, 1911, the above disease was made notifiable in London and since that date five cases were notified in this Borough, and 69 in the whole of London. Acute Polio-Myelitis has Becn for many years known under the name of Infantile Paralysis, and occurs chiefly among children. In recent years greater attention has Becn called to it on account of epidemics in America, Australia and Sweden. In this country localised outbreaks have occurred in Devon, Cornwall, and in the Midlands, and these outbreaks have Becn investigated by the Local Government Board. 150 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In December, 1911, the Board circulated a Memorandum to Sanitary Authorities giving particulars of the symptoms of the disease, its fatality, and methods of control that should be adopted. As this Memorandum was of such importance, not only to Health Authorities, but also to Medical Practitioners, containing as it did information that could not be derived from ordinary text books, I advised the Council that it would be most desirable that every medical man in the Borough should possess a copy of it. The Council agreed to this and a copy was sent to every medical practitioner in the Borough. The following extract from this Memorandum with reference to the means to be adopted for the control of the disease was as follows:— "The possibility of administrative control over Polio-Myelitis is greatly increased by active co-operation between the medical officer of health and the medical practitioners in a district. In view of the difficulty in diagnosing certain forms of Polio-Myelitis, medical practitioners should be invited to confer with the medical officer of health as to cases of anomalous illness; thus the medical officer of health may be enabled to assist the practitioner with information as to similar cases which may be in his possession. "The Sanitary Authority should be prepared to give facilities for the examination by competent bacteriologists of material derived from the sick. "It is important that precautionary measures should be taken in all suspected cases. As it has Becn shown experimentally that the virus is present in the nasal mucous membrane, an antiseptic solution should be applied by means of a spray to the throats and nasal passages, not only of the patients, but of all persons brought into contact with them. The virus can be killed experimentally by a one per cent. solution of peroxide of hydrogen, or by a solution of permanganate of potassium—1:500. "All discharges from the patient as well as all articles which may be soiled by such discharges should be immediately disinfected. 151 Report of the Medical Officer of Health "The sick should be isolated from the healthy, and if appropriate isolation and nursing cannot be obtained at home the patient should be treated in an isolation hospital. The sick room and its contents should be disinfected at the end of the illness. "No child should be allowed to attend school from an infected family." Of the five cases notified none died, but four of the cases were permanently paralysed, the latest inquiries in the current year showing that complete recovery had not taken place. The mortality is about 12 per cent. as a rule, but a large proportion of the cases who recover are permanently paralysed. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. The above disease was made a notifiable one in London on the 1st March, 1911, and since then 34 cases have Becn notified in the Borough and 489 in the whole of London. This disease is, as its name implies, a disease of new born children. The importance of notification is that if treatment is not immediately carried out blindness results, and the principal duty of the Sanitary Authority is to see that the patients have immediate and proper treatment. When a notification has Becn received the Inspector visits the house and ascertains if a medical man is in attendance and if the mother has sufficient knowledge to carry out the treatment ordered. If not, then arrangements are made with district nurses to carry out the treatment, and if a doctor is not in attendance the parents are advised to call in one at once or take the patient to a special hospital. Of the 34 cases notified, six were in Clapham, one in Putney, 11 in Streatham, one in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth Three of the cases in Wandsworth occurred in the Workhouse. 152 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 31 of the cases were visited and it was ascertained that 14 were attended at birth by midwives, 15 were treated at hospitals as outpatients, two as in-patients, and three were removed to the Union Infirmary, the 11 remaining being treated at home. Two of the cases have lost the sight of one eye, one of these being still an out-patient at a hospital. The others, with the exception of two who died from other diseases, have, as far as could be ascertained, completely recovered. Glanders and Anthrax Orders. Under the above Orders two cases of Anthrax and five cases of Glanders were notified by the Veterinary Inspectors of the London County Council. In these cases the necessary steps in connection with the disinfection and cleansing of the premises were taken by the officials of the London County Council, but the officers of the Borough Council visited the premises and obtained the names of any men who had Becn in contact with the diseased animals and notified them that if any symptoms of illness appeared the fact should be at once reported.

There has Becn a slight increase in the rate from this disease compared with the previous year and with the decennial average, and in the various sub-districts there has Becn a considerable increase in Putney and Streatham, a slight increase in Clapham, but a decrease in Tooting and Wandsworth. It is specially noticeable that the death-rate in Tooting is the lowest of all the subdistricts, not only for 1911, but during the whole of the 10 years. In the decennium 1851-1860 this rate for England and Wales was only 32.5, but it increased in 1891-1900 to 75.8, and for London only in the decennium 1851-1860 it was 42, and for 1891-1900 85, or slightly more than double. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Chronic Poisonings. Two deaths occurred from the above, one from Lead Poisoning in the person of a house painter, aged 43, and the other, in which an Inquest was held, from Ptomaine Poisoning from eating tinned pineapple. In the latter case it was much to be regretted that no information was given before the death of the patient by the medical man in attendance, and it was not till after the Inquest was held that inquiries were made. Careful inquiry into the history of the case showed that in all probability the death was not due to so-called Ptomaine Poisoning, but to poisoning by tin. All the occupants of the house suffered from symptoms of poisoning and a personal inquiry into these symptoms strengthened the opinion I formed that tin was the cause. Unfortunately I was not able to procure any of the fruit for analysis as it had all Becn consumed and the tin itself destroyed. Samples were taken from shops in the vicinity with the result that in every one tin was found to be present, but not in excessive quantity. The following report was made to the Public Health Committee on the matter, and a copy of it forwarded to the Local Government Board:— "Report re Food Poisoning at Park Hill, Clapham. "On Friday, August 4th, my attention was called to a paragraph in the Daily Papers with reference to the death from so-called Ptomaine poisoning at Park Hill, Clapham, an inquest having Becn held on a lady who died at that adddress on the 29th July. No previous information had Becn given to me either by the Coroner, the medical man in attendance, or by the relations of the deceased. "My inquiries showed that all the occupiers of the house partook of tinned pineapple on the 26th July, and that all suffered from similar symptoms, viz.: colic, vomiting and diarrhoea. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 157 "On inquiry I have ascertained that six people sat down to dinner on Wednesday night, the 26th, their ages being respectively, occupier of house 58 years, wife 54 years, a son 22 years, a daughter 19 years, one lady guest 19 years, and one male guest 30 years. The dinner consisted of soup made from stock, joint and sweets, which consisted of the pineapple in question and custard. The only dish partaken of by all the six and also by the servants was the pineapple. I also ascertained that the pineapple had Becn purchased on the Saturday previously by the wife of the occupier and that it was made into a jelly by the cook on Wednesday morning, the gelatine used being ordinary leaf gelatine, the stock of which was in the house, and part of which had Becn used with no ill results. The pineapple jelly after being made was kept in the larder from mid-day until it was placed on the table about 8.30 p.m. "The occupier's wife partook of the pineapple jelly only, she had no soup, joint or other sweet. She was the first to be affected, having Becn taken ill with vomiting, diarrhoea and colic about 3 a.m. The husband was taken ill about three hours afterwards and the daughter at the same time. The son is stated to have Becn ill about seven hours after partaking of it (i.e., about 4 a.m.), the female guest about 6 in the morning and the male guest, although he felt sick about an hour after dinner did not have any definite symptoms until the evening of the next day, nearly 24 hours after. "With regard to the servants I have Becn informed that the cook returned about 10 p.m. and finished the pineapple jelly. The housemaid who had taken some jelly previously was taken ill about 4 a.m. and the cook was taken ill about 5 a.m. "The symptoms in all the cases were the same, but the occupier's wife was exceedingly ill and in a state of collapse when the Doctor saw her early in the morning. "I have also seen the medical man in attendance who gave me the particulars of the illness and who informed me that he saw the tin in which the pineapple was bought, but that he could not see anything unusual. 158 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "No analysis of the contents of the stomach was made, although if I had Becn present at the Inquest I should have advised the Coroner to have had this done. "Taking all the circumstances into consideration I think it much more likely to have Becn a case of chemical poisoning by tin rather than a toxin poison. "I am having several samples taken of tinned pineapple and will report to you the result in due course." Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System. From these diseases 358 deaths occurred, compared with 351 in 1910, 372 in 1909, and 320 in 1908. 75 of these deaths were in Clapham, 35 in Putney, 112 in Streatham, 39 in Tooting, and nine in Wandsworth. 74 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 38 in Putney, 108 in Streatham, 29 in Tooting, and 113 in Wandsworth. 25 of the deaths were due to Meningitis, 147 to Cerebral Haemorrhage or Apoplexy, 29 to Convulsions, 22 to Softening of the Brain, 29 to Paralysis, 27 to General Paralysis of the Insane, seven to Locomotor Ataxy, 13 to Epilepsy, and 59 to other diseases of the Nervous System. The number of deaths from Cerebral Haemorrhage or Apoplexy in each sub-district was as follows:—in Clapham 31, in Putney 15, in Streatham 56, in Tooting 14, and in Wandsworth 31, a total of 147, compared with 155 in 1910, 158 in 1909, and 120 in 1908. 35 of the deaths from Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System were under one year, five from one to two years, four from two to five years, 11 from five to 15 years, 13 from 15 to 25 years, 42 from 25 to 45 years, 97 from 45 to 65 years, and 151 over 65 years. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 159 Of the total deaths from the above under one year, viz.: 35, 29 were from Convulsions, while of the total deaths over 65 years, viz.: 151, 85 were from Cerebral Haemorrhage. Circulatory Diseases. From the above group of diseases 359 deaths occurred, 140 of which, 68 males and 72 females, were due to Organic disease of the Heart. 74 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 38 in Putney, 105 in Streatham, 29 in Tooting, and 113 in Wandsworth. Of the deaths from all diseases of the Heart, three were from two to five years, 14 from five to 15 years, 12 from 15 to 25 years, 47 from 25 to 45 years, 103 from 45 to 65 years, and 180 over 65 years. The number of deaths in 1911 was 47 more than in 1910, but 43 under the corrected decennial average. Respiratory Diseases. The total number of deaths was 531, 263 of males and 268 of females, compared with 509 in 1910, 690 in 1909, 543 in 1908, 550 in 1907, and 511 in 1906. The number of deaths was 22 more than in the previous year, but 79 under the corrected decennial average. 117 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 52 in Putney, 129 in Streatham, 58 in Tooting, and 175 in Wandsworth. Compared with 1910, there was a decrease in Streatham and Tooting, and an increase in Clapham and Wandsworth, while in Putney the number of deaths was the same. 225 of the deaths occurred from Bronchitis, compared with 240 in 1910; 29 from Lobar Pneumonia, 115 from Lobular or Broncho-Pneumonia, 130 from Pneumonia in which the exact form was not distinguished; and 32 from other diseases of the Respiratory Organs. 160 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 121 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 44 from one to two years, 36 from two to five years, 11 from five to 15 years, nine from 15 to 25 years, 34 from 25 to 45 years, 91 from 45 to 65 years, and 185 over 65 years. The greatest number of deaths from these diseases occurred among persons under one year and over 65 years. From Bronchitis alone 133 deaths occurred among persons over 65 years of age, compared with 138 in 1910. Appendicitis and Typhlitis. 24 deaths occurred from these diseases, 14 of males and 10 of females, equal to a rate of 77 per million, compared with 21 in 1910, and 19 in 1909. It is advisable to make a special note of this cause of death as it seems to show a tendency to increase. This increase may be due to greater precision in certification, many of the deaths previously registered as due to Peritonitis having Becn doubtless due to Appendicitis. The Registrar General in his Report for England and Wales for 1909, states that the recorded death-rate had increased from 38 per million in 1901 to 64 in 1909, while the rate from Peritonitis has decreased from nearly 51 to 17. Deaths from other causes. From Alcoholism, Acute and Chronic, 14 deaths, five of males and nine of females, occurred; and 28, 14 of males and 14 of females, from Cirrhosis of the Liver, compared with nine and 40 in 1910. From Nephritis and Blight's disease 128 deaths occurred, 65 of males and 63 of females, compared with 126 in 1910. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 161 From Accidents and diseases of Pregnancy and Child Birth 15 deaths occurred, 14 from 25 to 45 years, and one from 45 to 65 years. This, added to the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever, viz. : eight, gives a total of 23 deaths after child-birth, or a proportion of 3 43 per 1,000 births, compared with 2 44 in 1910. In London for the year 1910, which is the latest available report, this rate was 2.38. Of the 15 deaths, two occurred in Clapham, none in Putney, two in Streatham, six in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth. Five of the deaths were due to Haemorrhage, three to Rupture of the Uterus, three to Embolism or Thrombosis, and four to other diseases or accidents of Parturition. Diabetes Mellitus was the cause of 23 deaths, 10 of males and 13 of females, five in Clapham, five in Putney, seven in Streatham, one in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth, compared with 23 in 1910, Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. 268 deaths, 159 of males and 109 of females, were registered as having occurred from these diseases, compared with 249 in 1910, 254 in 1909, 294 in 1908, 285 in 1907, and 315 in 1906.

There has again been a marked increase in the number of deaths in Institutions, and to show that the increase has been going on for some years, the following Table has been prepared. The comparative percentages for London are also shown, and it will be noted that in the 20 years 1890-1909 these increased in London from 24.0 to 42.0), with an average of 32.51, and in Wandsworth from I4.6 to 30.5, with an average of 20.21. In this Borough the percentage is lower than for the whole of London, and this is what might be expected in consequence of the social condition of the population, but in spite of this, it is rather startling to find that nearly 30 per cent, of the total deaths occurred in Institutions, and that for the year 1910 14.5 per cent, occurred in Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries. Compared with the 20 years' average, the greatest increase has occurred among the deaths in General and Special Hospitals, etc., while the rate in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals is slightly lower. 173 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The diagram which follows shows graphically the proportion which the more prevalent diseases bear to the total deaths. The whole area of the circle represents the deaths from all causes, and the various segments the deaths from particular diseases or groups of diseases. it will be observed that the deaths from Diarrhoea, Tuberculosis, Cancer, and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs contribute very largely to the total mortality, and also that the notifiable diseases, other than Pulmonary Tuberculosis, contribute very little. 175 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Proportion per 1,000 Deaths from all causes. Notifiable Diseases 14.2 Measles 61.0 Influenza 6.4 Whooping Cough 17.5 Diarrhœa and Dysentery 92.5 Tuberculosis (all forms) 103.0 Phthisis (74.2) Bronchitis 59.7 Pneumonia 81.1 Cancer 85.0 Nervous Diseases 94.6 Circulatory Diseases 94.8 Premature Birth 26.8 Congenital Debility, &c. 44.3 Old Age 55.7 Digestive Diseases 38.2 Urinary Diseases 41.6 Violence 31.8 Other Causes 51.8 All Causes 1,000.0 Cutting-off Notices. During the year 100 notices with respect to 103 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 10 of the premises were in Clapham, 15 in Putney, 36 in Streatham, 20 in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth. 176 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 54 premises from 31 premises in consequence of defects, in 16 the premises were empty, and in two the supply was withdrawn by request. Compared with 1910, there has been an increase of 24 in the number of notices received, but a decrease of one in the number of premises affected. When a notice has been received that the water has been cut off, either for arrears or in consequence of defects, the Sanitary Inspector visits the premises, and if these have no water supply, serves an intimation notice under the Public Health (London) Act. If this notice is not complied with the matter is reported to the Public Health Committee, so that a statutory notice may be served. During the year several cases have had to be so reported, and the Public Health Committee have considered the whole question of the procedure adopted by the Water Board in cutting off the water and so making an inhabited house unfit for human habitation, instead of taking action under Section 33 of the Metropolitan Water Board (Charges) Act, 1907. The matter was reported to the Council, who communicated with the Metropolitan Water Board, suggesting that proceedings might be taken under Section 33 of this Act. The Metropolitan Water Board replied to the Council's letter to the effect that each case was carefully considered before instructions were issued to withdraw the supply, and that the Committee were satisfied that those instructions were requisite for the protection of the Board's revenue, and also stated that instructions of this nature are only issued when the Committee are satisfied that they are necessary to prevent'an abuse of the Board's desire to reduce to a minimum the practice of withdrawing supplies for nonpayment of the water rate, and that in the cases referred to by the Council every endeavour had been made to secure payment before the supply was withdrawn. 177 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Mortuaries. The Mortuaries in Clapham, Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth have been visited several times during the year, and I am able to report that the By-laws and Regulations have been carried out in a satisfactory manner. With reference to the Wandsworth Mortuary the Public Health Committee have on several occasions had the question of providing a new mortuary for Wandsworth before them, but so far no decision as to the site has been arrived at. The Mortuary at Tooting has been closed, but a temporary one has been provided pending the erection of a new one in Wandsworth. In Clapham, 43 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, compared with 21 in 1910 ; in Streatham 55, compared with 56 ; and in Wandsworth 108, of which 54 were from Wandsworth, 33 from Putney, and 21 from Tooting—a total of 206 compared with 186 in 1910. No infectious cases were admitted to any of the Mortuaries during the year. General Sanitary Work in 1911. The following list shows the special inspectiors made by me during the year (1)—In consequence of several complaints several inspections were made of the River Graveney at Southcroft Road, as the complaints were that after heavy rain the river overflowed and caused a nuisance on the land adjoining. It was found that when the river subsided large stagnant pools were left, and these gave rise to offensive smells, which were a nuisance to persons residing in the neighbourhood. Noticcs were served on the owner of the land and the nuisance was abated. f 2 178 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (2)—Complaints were also made with respect to the brook at the rear of the houses in Strathbrook Road, near Norbury, and an inspection of the brook showed that in the summer months it was a nuisance. As this was a boundary ditch, and as it seemed that the best way to abate the nuisance was to pipe the brook for a considerable portion of its course, the matter was left in the hands of the Borough Engineer. (3)—Special inspections were made on several occasions during the year of the new roads between Moyser Road and Southcroft Road, Streatham. Several of these were in such a condition as to be a nuisance, but steps have now been taken by the Council, and by the owners in one instance, to carry out the work necessary to abate the nuisance. (4)—A complaint was received from the London County Council with respect to piggeries in Merton Road in close proximity to Southfields School, and on inspection it was found that a large number of pigs were kept in sties within 40 yards of a road leading to the school premises. The matter was reported to the Public Health Committee, who, after full consideration of the facts adjourned the matter for three months so as to give the owner an opportunity of removing the pigs and sties outside the limit laid down by the Public Health (London) Act. An irspection after three months was made, and 1 was able to report that the pigs had been removed from the sties in question. (5)—On the 25th August one of the Sanitary Inspectors reported that a band of Hungarian gypsies had encamped on land in Garratt Lane, and on inspecting the premises he found that there were about 120 men, women and children occupying 17 tents which had been erected on the land. He also reported that the sanitary accommodation in the house adjoining was totally insufficient, and that the gypsies were filthy in their habits and had not the most elementary knowledge of sanitation. Notices were served on the owner of the land to provide sanitary accommodation, and also on the occupiers of the tents for the insanitary conditions. 179 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. I visited the encampment on the nth September, but the tents had been taken down and the tribe were removing out of the Borough. The owner of the land removed the whole of the offensive matter which had been left. Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting these people removed, but the owner of the land, as soon as he lealised what his responsibilities were, gave every assistance, and thus facilitated their departure. At the same time, another small band of the same tribe rented part of a house and land in Southfield. As there were only 14 adults and 16 children in this tribe, the sanitary accommodation in this house was sufficient. These gypsies also had no idea of sanitation, but eventually came to realise that it was necessary for them to alter their habits. The house was a large one, but several of the rooms were in a dirty condition and notices were served on the occupier, who rented the premises to the gypsies, and these notices were complied with. The Sanitary Inspector visited the premises three or four times a week, and I personally inspected the premises on six different occasions, as several complaints had been received from the occupiers of the houses adjoining. The complaints made were mainly of the noise produced by hammering, the work carried on by these gypsies being the repairing of copper utensils. Eventually, after a considerable amount of difficulty, the tribe were persuaded to leave, and the premises were vacated on the 23rd December. 180 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (6)—As in previous years, special inspections were made of several localities in consequence of complaints of smells from road gullies and sewer ventilators. The number of complaints was greater than in the previous year, especially in Streatham; this having been due to the fact that the climatic conditions were favourable. In all 214 complaints were received, compared with 117 in 1910: 11 from Clapham North, 10 from Clapham South, 24 from Putney, 56 from Streatham, 22 from Balham, 21 from Tooting, 33 from Southfield, 12 from Fairfield, and 25 from Springfield Wards. All these complaints were forwarded to the Borough Engineer, who reported that in all the cases the necessary cleansing and flushing, or other work, had been carried out. (7)—Inspections were also made of several passages and mews, with the result that several have been satisfactorily dealt with, but there still remains some in which, owing to legal difficulties as to ownership, the necessary work has not been done. (a) Yard at rear of 581-591, Wandsworth Road. Entrance and part of the yard paved with granite setts. (b) Passage at rear of 99-115, Balham High Road, and 1-13, Bedford Hill has been concreted in a satisfactory manner. (c) Passage at rear of 74-86, Balham High Road has been properly paved with concrete. (d) Passage at rear of 238-258, Balham High Road has been repaired. (e) Land at rear of Blackshaw Road, Tooting, has been paved and drained, and is now in a satisfactory condition. (/) Passage at rear of Furzedown Market, Tooting, has now been satisfactorily paved and drained by the owner. (g) Passage at rear of 154-162, High Street, Putney, has been properly paved. i8i Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (h) Passage at rear of 115-133, Mitcham Road, Tooting, is being satisfactorily repaired, but owing to frost the work was not completed at the end of the year. (i) Passage at rear of 174-190, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, has not been done, but the matter is now in the Solicitor's hands and proceedings against the owners are being taken. (k) Passage at rear of 102-116, Mitcham Lane, Streatham, has been properly gravelled and the nuisance abated. (8)—Special house-to-house inspections were made during the year in Young's Rents, Rowlands Cottages, Rashleigh Street, and Union Grove, Clapham ; Biggs Row, Weimar Street, and Brewhouse Lane, Putney ; Greyhound Square, Mill Lane, New Park Road, Foss Road and Hazelhurst Road, Streatham ; Graveney Road, Selkirk Road, Trevelyan Road, Aldis Mews, Rookstone Road, and Letchworth Street, Tooting ; and Point Pleasant, Warple Way, Warple Road, Armoury Yard, Frogmore, Lydclen Road, Lydden Grove, and Wardley Street, Wandsworth. These inspections were made chiefly on account of nuisances and damp conditions reported to me by the Sanitary Inspectors, and also to ascertain if any of these premises could be reported to the Council under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act. Including the house-to-house inspections and inspections for certificates under the Revenue Act, but excluding the routine inspection of bakehouses, slaughter-houses, cowsheds, and offensive trade premises, 1,150 inspections were made of premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance at the Police Court was necessary on 10 occasions during the year (9)—A special inspection was also made in company with the Borough Engineer of the land at Putney Vale acquired by the Council for the extension of the Cemetery there, and the following report was made:— 182 Report of the Mcdical Officer of Health. " Putney Vale Cemetery Extension. "I have made an inspection of the land proposed to be acquired by the Council at Putney Vale for an extension of the Cemetery, and have to report as follows :— "This land consists of about 30 acres, part of which is arable and part grazing land. The highest point of the land, which is close to Wimbledon Common, is about no feet above ordnance datum, and the lowest point, which is close to Newlands Farm, is about 45 feet. "The soil is a mixture of mould, loam and clay, the latter differing in character in the trial holes, in some being more friable and containing a larger admixture of sand than in others. Generally speaking, the geological conditions are very similar to those in the present cemetery. "Six trial holes have been dug at different points to the depth of 8 feet, and in four of these no water was found at the time, but three days after water, varying in depth from six to to 23 inches, had collected. In other two a few inches of water were found at the time of opening, and after three days this had increased to two feet in one and four feet in the other. In these two the soil was of a more pervious character. "The ground water has a natural flow to the Beverley Brook, which is about 500 yards distant. "There will be 110 difficulty in draining the whole of the land to the depth necessary to render the graves dry, as there is a sewer of sufficient capacity in close proximity. "There are no sources of domestic water supply near the site, all the houses in the neighbourhood being supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. "In my opinion, with proper drainage the proposed site is suitable for a cemetery." I83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Revenue Act. During the year 18 Certificates were granted under the above Act, one was deferred and three refused. The certificates granted referred to 115 houses, or 239 tenements. Housing, Town Planning', etc,, Act, 1909. All the house-to-house inspections during the year have been carried out under and for the purposes of Section 17 of this Act, and the results of these inspections have been recorded on the cards, particulars of which are given in the Report for 1910. It has not been found necessary to take any action under this Act as it has been found, after careful consideration and personal inspection that the nuisances detected could all be dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The four houses in Putney and one in Wandsworth, reported on in 1910 under the above Act, have not been demolished, but the former are still closed and the latter is now used as a store shed. The Tables of house-to-house inspections show, as in former years, the name of the street, the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, and the number of families living in one, two, three, or four rooms and upwards. The defects found are given in the Table of Sanitary Operations, as also the number of intimation and statutory notices served and complied with. During the year a systematic and thorough inspection has been made of the older houses in the Borough occupied by persons of the working class, and as will be seen in the Tables a very large amount of valuable work has been carried out. 184 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year the Council considered the question of the Regulations as to underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places, and the following were drawn up and approved by the Local Government Board on the 26th May, 1911. " REGULATIONS AS TO UNDERGROUND ROOMS HABITUALLY USED AS SLEEPING PLACES. " Whereas by Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, it is enacted as follows :— " Sub-Section 7. A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining, or nearest to the room shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a dwelling house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either— "(a) Is not on an average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling ; or "(b) Does not comply with such regulations as the local authority, with the consent of the Local Government Board, may prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation. Provided that if the local authority, after being required to do so by the Local Government Board, fail to make such regulations, or such regulations as the Board approve, the Board may themselves make them, and the regulations so made shall have effect as if they had been made by the local authority, with the consent of the Board. "Provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which this sub-section applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place ; 185 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and that, if the occupier of the room after notice of an order has been served upon him fails to comply with the order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, he made against him. "Now therefore we, the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth being the local authority for the said Metropolitan Borough, hereby prescribe the following Regulations with which a room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part •of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall comply, namely: — " (a) Such room shall in every part thereof have at least three feet of its height above the level of the surface of the street or ground adjoining, or nearest to such room. Provided that if the width of the area hereinafter mentioned is not less than the height of the room from the floor to the said surface, or is not less than six feet, the height of the room above such surface may be less than three feet but not in any case less than one foot. " (b) Every wall of such room shall be constructed with a proper horizontal damp-proof course, and, if in contact with the soil, shall be effectually protected against dampness from that soil by means of a vertical dampproof course, or otherwise. " (c) There shall be outside of and adjoining such room and extending along the entire frontage thereof and open upwards from six irche? below the level of the floor thereof an area properly paved and effectually drained and at least four feet wide in every part ; provided that the width of such area may be not less in an\T part than three feet, if the mean width of the area be not less than four feet ; provided also that in the area there may be placed steps necessary for access to the room, and over and across such area there may be steps necessary for access to any buildings above the room, if the steps are so placed in such case as not to be over or across any external window of the room. 186 Report oj the Medical Officer of Health. "The space, if any, beneath the floor of such room shall be provided with adequate means of ventilation. "(e) Every drain passing under any such room shall be properly constructed of a gas-tight pipe. "(/) Such room shall be effectually protected against the rising of any effluvia or exhalation by means of a layer of good cement concrete at least six inches thick laid upon the soil of the site of the entire room or in some other equally effectual manner. "(g) Every such room which is without a fireplace,, and a flue properly constructed and properly connected with such fireplace, shall be provided with special and adequate means of ventilation by a sufficient aperture or air shaft, which shall provide an unobstructed sectional area of 100 square inches at the least. "(h) Such room shall have one or more windows opening directly into the external air, with a total area clear of the sash frames equal to at least one-tenth of the floor area of the room, and so constructed that one half at least of every such window can be opened, and that the opening may in every case extend to the top of the window. "The Common Seal of the Council was by order of the Council affixed this Third day of May, iqn, in the presence of HEX. GEO. HILLS, Town Clerk " The consent of the Local Government Board is hereby given to the foregoing Regulations this Nineteenth day of May, 191 x. H. C. MONRO, Secretary. "Acting on behalf of the said Board under the authority of their General Order, dated the Twenty-sixth day of May, 1877." 187 Report of the Medical Officer of Health At the present time inspections are being made to ascertain the number of rooms to which these Regulations would apply but so far very few have been discovered, and in many of these the occupation as a sleeping room has been discontinued as the occupier had other available rooms in the house. I have personally inspected most of the cases reported by the Sanitary Inspectors, but in none of those visited were the infringements of the Regulations of a serious character. In this Borough very few of the houses erected in recent years have basements, and it is chiefly in houses which have been made down so as to become tenement houses that there is any separate letting of basements. I shall be able to lay before the Public Health Committee early in the present year a report of the inspection of the Borough in this respect and also the result of any action taken. Sanitary Operations. The Table of Sanitary operations shows in detail the amount and nature of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 2,076, compared with 1789, in 1910, 1,692 in 1909, 1,645 in 1908, and 1,836 in 1907. There was an increase in Clapham, North and South, Putney, Streatham, Balham, Tooting and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Southfield Ward, while Fairfield Ward is the same, compared with the previous year. Seven of these complaints were made to the London County Council, and these were at once attended to. 188 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of houses and premises inspected was 31,973, an increase of 2,042 compared with 1910, and of 5,038 compared with 1909. There was an increase in the number of houses and premises inspected in Clapham North and South, Streatham, Balham, Tootirg, Fairfield and Springfield Wards., and a decrease in Putney and Southfield Wards. The total number of house-to-house inspections made was 2,486, compared with 6,276 in 1910, 7,007 in 1909, 5,575 in 1908, 5,718 in 1907, and 5,686 in 1906. There has been an increase in the number of these inspections in Fairfield Ward, and a decrease in Clapham North and South, Putney, Streatham, Balham, Tooting, Southfield and Springfield Wards. Although the number of these inspections is much lower than in the five previous years, yet it will be noted that the total number of inspections has increased by 2,042. There were several reasons why the number of house-to-house inspections were lower, one being that the system adopted in these inspections and for recording the same has, as stated in the Report for last year, been altered so as to comply with the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909. Another reason was that a greater number of inspections was made after notification of infectious diseases, as well as after Measles, Whooping Cough and other diseases notified from Elementary Schools. A third reason was that many inspections were made of premises after notification from the Education Department of the London County Council of verminous children to ascertain if it was necessary to deal with the premises under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. 189 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Tables of house-to-house inspections which follow show the names of the streets and the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, the percentage of defects to houses inspected, as well as the number of families living in one, two, three, and four rooms and upwards. In 1,953 out of a total of 2,486 houses inspected, or 78.55 per cent., sanitary defects necessitating the service of an intimation notice were found. The highest percentage was in the Clapham North Ward, where the percentage was 93.25, and the lowest in Southfield, where it was only 44.48, the next lowest being Putney, where it was 60.10. The following Table, which is prepared from the figures given in the summary, shows the percentage to total number of families of those living in one, two, three, or four rooms and upwards, in the separate Wards and in the whole Borough, in the premises inspected in 1911.

Fairfield and Springfield Wards had the highest percentage of families living in one room, and Putney the lowest. Clapham North and South had the highest percentage living in two rooms, and Southfield the lowest. Putney had the highest percentage living in three rooms, and Clapham North the lowest. Southfield and Clapham North had the highest percentage living in four rooms and upwards, and Clapham South the lowest. In the Borough, . of the total families whose houses were inspected during the year, viz., 3,682, 87 per cent, lived in one room, compared with 7.4 per cent, in 1910, 73 per cent, in 1909, and 7.6 per cent, in 1908 ; 14.8 per cent, in two rooms, compared with 9.5, 10.3, 11.8 and io-4 ; 25.2 per cent, in three rooms, compared with 29.06, 27.5, 297 and 347 ; and 513 per cent, in four rooms and upwards, compared with 54.1, 54.9, 50.9 and 48. The small number of house-to-house inspections in Tooting Ward was due to the fact that the Inspectors in that Ward have also portions of Balham and Streatham Wards under their supervision, and also the number of inspections made by these Inspectors on account of Measles during the year shows a very large increase. 192 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This nuisance was most common in Fairfield and Springfield Wards, and the animals kept were chiefly ducks and hens. 34 smoke nuisances were reported during the year: none in Clapham, four in Putney, one in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 24 in Wandsworth. Two complaints of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department of the London County Council with regard to two premises, and five complaints from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society with regard to five premises. These complaints were all at once attended to and the premises kept under observation. In one instance complaint was made to the Local Government Board by residents in Bendon Valley, Wandsworth, of nuisance from a laundry shaft in the vicinity and the following report was made on the matter :— "With reference to the letter from the Local Government Board, enclosing copy of a petition from 20 residents of Bendon Valley, Wandsworth, I have to report that the premises in question, viz.: The Primrose Laundry, has been under the observation of the Public Health Department for some time. On two occasions, in July, 1906, and again in October, 1907, proceedings were taken on the instructions of the Public Health Committee, but in neither case was a fine inflicted, the Magistrate making an order for the abatement of the nuisance with 6s. costs in each case. After the last conviction several alterations were made in the laundry and a new furnace and 206 Report of the Medical Officer of Healih. boiler fitted. In April, 1908, notice was served for black smoke for three minutes, but the Solicitor advised that no proceedings could be taken under the old order. During the rest of 1908, in 1909 and 1910, although observations were frequently made by the Inspector, only on one or two occasions was it reported that black smoke was issuing, and that only for a period of one or two minutes. In 1911 on two occasions in January black smoke was noticed for one minute, but since then although observation has been kept, no nuisance has been detected. "I have visited the premises and at the time of my visit I asked the stoker to stoke up in my presence, but this was not followed by any emission of black smoke. The furnaces are fitted with forced draught driven by a fan and in my opinion if properly used there should be no emission of black smoke. It is quite possible, however, that careless stoking would produce black smoke, and owing to the proximity of the furnace chimney to the houses in Benden Valley it is quite possible that on some occasions the nuisance noted by the complainants existed. "I have instructed the Inspector to take particular note of this chimney and if any black smoke is noted the matter will be reported to the Committee." In all, 189 observations for black smoke were made by the Sanitary Inspectors. 34 cases were repoited, and 31 notices were served. 194 soil pipes were repaired, 40 in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 55 in Streatham, 47 in Tooting, and 36 in Wandsworth, compared with 153 in 1910, and 182 in 1909. 869 leaky roofs and gutters were repaired, compared with 1,225 in 1910. and 1,159 in 1909. 207 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 30 unwholesome or dilapidated houses were cleansed and repaired, one in Clapham, none in Putney, two in Streatham, five in Tooting and 22 in Wandsworth, compared with 38 in 1910, and 46 in 1909. A large amount of work has again been carried out to abate nuisances arising from damp conditions. In all 1,228 premises have been dealt with, 259 in Clapham, 54 in Putney, 301 in Streatham, 160 in Tooting, and 453 in Wandsworth ; and in 444 of these, 86 in Clapham, one in Putney, 46 in Streatham, 60 in Tooting, and 250 in Wandsworth, damp courses have been inserted. I have personally inspected all the premises where damp courses were inserted as well as a large number of premises where this had been done in 1909 and 1910, and I am able to report that the dampness has been quite removed and the houses rendered much healthier. The number of unclassified nuisances was 765, 295 in Clapham, 49 in Putney, 216 in Streatham, 47 in Tooting, and 158 in Wandsworth, compared with 746 in 1910. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 4,419 (773 in Clapham, 237 in Putney, 1,261 in Streatham, 533 in Tooting, and 1,615 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,166 in 1910, 3,146 in 1909, 2,868 in 1908, 3,206 in 1907, and 2,794 in 1906. The increase was altogether due to the increase in the number of disinfections carried out after Measles, Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 208 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1,603 lots bedding were stoved at the Disinfecting Station, compared with 1,230 in 1910, 1,584 in 1909. 1,826 in 1908, 1,948 in 1907, and 1,669 in 1906 The 1,603 lots of bedding included the following :—1,008 beds, 1,084 bolsters, 2,695 pillows, 1,187 mattresses, 433 palliasses, 1,952 sheets, 1,479 quilts, 686 cushions, 5,581 articles of clothing, 2,734 blankets, 146 carpets, and 2,628 extra articles, a total of 21,613 articles, compared with 15,430 in 1910, 20,843 in 1909, 24,034 in 7908, 29,102 in 1907, and 28,885 in 1906. 2,638 premises were disinfected after Measles and 313 after Tuberculous disease of the Lungs compared with 418 and 265 in 1910. 35 beds, 12 bolsters, 53 pillows, 46 mattresses, 38 palliasses, 13 sheets, 3 quilts, 18 cushions, 122 articles of clothing, 9 blankets, 31 carpets, and 87 extra articles, were removed and destroyed by request of the owners during the year. Disinfection was also carried out by the Sanitary Staff at premises after non-notifiable diseases, chiefly Cancer, and the sum of £31 7s. 6d. was received for such disinfection. 240 rooms were disinfected with sulphur in consequence of their verminous condition, and 11 lots of verminous bedding disinfected. I have regularly visited the Disinfecting Station during the year, and am able to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. No complaints of damage to goods by disinfection have been received during the year. 209 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was as follows :— £ s. d. Wages 914 4 8 Fuel 6 3 3 Horse Hire 86 19 0 Stores, Tools, and other materials 71 5 6 Repairs to Horse Vans 13 13 0 Disinfectants, etc. 20 13 7 Repairs to Motor Van 22 18 0 Motor Running Expenses 38 19 1 Lighting 2 7 10 Insurance 3 18 8 Water 6 8 4 £1.187 10 11 The number of lots of bedding stoved was 1,603. Cost per lot of bedding 14s. 9d. Cleansing of Persons Act. The baths at the Disinfecting Station have been more frequently used this year, chiefly owing to the greater number of verminous children dealt with. The names of 361 children, 60 belonging to Clapham, 18 to Putney, 45 to Streatham, 40 to Tooting, and 198 to Wandsworth, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In the majority of cases only the heads of the children were verminous, but in a few cases the bodies and clothing were also verminous. Of these latter, 14, nine boys and five girls, were cleansed at the baths, and the clothing was at the same time stoved with beneficial results. 210 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 18 adults also had baths, four being nurses who had been in attendance on cases of Puerperal Fever, nine were contacts with cases of Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, while five, three females and two males, were verminous. Inspection of Urinals in connection with Licensed Premises. The number of urinals inspected was T30, 38 in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 24 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 37 in Wandsworth. 389 inspections were made during the year and 37 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served and complied with. In the Borough there are at present 11 public sanitary conveniences, one of these, in Buckhold Road, having been constructed during the year. There are in addition 22 urinals only belonging to the Council. Police Court Proceedings. The list which follows shows particulars of Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. The total amount of fines inflicted was £12 3s. od., and the costs £4 13s. 6d., compared with £2345. od. and £14 7s. od. in 1910. The majority of the cases were with respect to nuisances or Contraventions of By-laws, while one was on account of the absence of a proper supply of water. - Three cases were for exposing unsound food for sale, and seven for selling milk without being registered as required by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885. 211 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Inspection of Milkshops, Cowsheds, &c. The following Table shows in concise form the number of milk premises, cowsheds, etc., on the register, the number of inspections, and the number of cases of legal proceedings during the year, as well as other information which it has been thought advisable to group together for the purpose of comparison with other Metropolitan Boroughs.

At the close of 1910 there were 336 milkshops on the Register, 57 have been added in 1911 and 38 removed, leaving 355 or the Register at the end of 1911. During the year 912 inspections were made of these premises and 41 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. Seven prosecutions were instituted for carrying on the business of a dairyman without being registered, and fines amounting to £2 10s. 6d. were imposed, with £1 4s. costs. Cowsheds. The following is a list of the registered Cowhouses in the district granted by the London County Council in October :— Clapham— London, Gloucester, and North Hants Dairy Company.

I am able to report that all the above were kept in a satisfactory condition during the year, and it was not necessary to serve any notices. Slaughter-houses. There were 17 Slaughter-houses and one Knacker's Yard on the Register in 1910, two in Clapham were removed, leaving 15 on the Register. During the year 320 inspections were made of these, but it was only necessary to serve three notices for cleansing. The usual 217 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. cleansing was carried out by the occupiers at the proper times. I have inspected all the slaughter-houses during the year, and I am able to report that the By-laws have been observed. During the year the Inspectors inspected the carcases of 503 cattle, 3,152 sheep, 250 pigs, and 31 calves in Slaughter-houses and Butchers' Shops, and reported that these were all sound when -exposed for sale. The following list shows the number of Slaughter-houses licensed by the London County Council in October :— Clapham— Masters, Albert, 63, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. (Condition—Small cattle only.) Yarworth, William, 140, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. (Condition—The licence is granted on the undertaking of the licensee that the killing of bullocks at these premises be restricted to the period of hot weather, and then only occasionally, and on the further condition that the slaughtering be limited to animals the meat from which is to be sold by retail in the shop attached to the premises.)

Harrison, Barber & Co., Ltd., Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, Knackers. Do. do. Bone Boilers. Do. do. Manure Manufacturers. (2.) Tucker & Co., Weimar Street, Putney, Soap Boilers. (3.) James Ford, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth, Fat Melter. The premises of Messrs. Dallett & Co have been pulled down and are therefore removed from the Register. 99 inspections of these have been made, and it was necessary to serve three intimation notices for contraventions of the By-laws. Ice Cream Premises. At the end of 1910 there were 287 of these on the Register. During 1911 42 were added and 25 removed, leaving a total of 304 on the Register. 480 inspections were made of these premises during the year and 53 notices were served, all of which were for cleansing. Houses Let in Lodgings. At the end of 1910 there were 292 houses let in lodgings on the Register. None were added during 1911 and none removed, making a total of 292 on the Register at the end of iqit. 721 inspections of these were made during the year, and 637 notices were served, 68 for overcrowding and 569 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. With regard to four premises summonses were issued for failing to cleanse and for other nuisances, and convictions were obtained in each case. 220 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. On the whole the By-laws have been satisfactorily complied with, although in some instances the cleansing was not carried out at the specified time. The question of making an alteration in the present By-laws so as to conform with the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, has been carefully considered by the Council, but it was not considered necessary to make any alteration at present as the Solicitor was of opinion that the By-laws were in compliance with that Act. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangements which have been made by the Council with a contractor for the removal of this refuse have during the year worked quite satisfactorily, and no complaints have been received. In a certain number of cases this refuse is removed privately, and this has also been carried out ir a satisfactory manner. Unsound Food. During the year two trunks of Soles, one box of Hake, one box of Whiting, one box of Herrings, one box of Skate, one trunk of Mackerel, 250 Eggs, two barrels of Apples, four trays of Pears, two baskets of Mushrooms, and one bag of Walnuts, were destroyed at the request of the owners, and the usual certificates granted. Factories and Workshops. Although there has been a decrease in the total number of inspections of the above, compared with 1910, yet an examination of the Tables will show that a very large amount of work has been done. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 221 As has been stated in this Report when dealing with Infective Diseases the Inspectors had a very large increase of cases to deal with, and this consequently lessened the time that could be devoted to inspections of factories and workshops. I have also this year visited a large number of these premises and am able to report that they are all in a very satisfactory condition. The fact that no prosecution was necessary to abate any nuisances found shows that there has been no difficulty in carrying out the provisions of the Act. With regard to outworkers it has again been found necessary, as a matter of routine, to forward a warning letter to the majority of employers. The Tables Vvhich follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both male and female Inspectors is there shown in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,690 including 128 retail bakehouses, 144 workshop laundries, 286 dressmakers' and milliners' premises, and 1,132 other workshops, but not including 374 factories, 1,094 workplaces, and 312 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1911 3,470 premises, compared with 3,420 in 1910, 3,305 in 1909, 3,347 in 1908, 3,281 in 1907, and 3,096 in 1906. The total number of inspections made during the year was 6,050, compared with 6,387 in 1910, 6,531 in 1909, 5,801 in 1908, 6,048 in 1907, and 5,997 in 1906. The total number of notices served was 462, 429 intimation and 33 statutory, compared with 580 in 1910, 597 in 1909, 434 in 1908, 453 in 1907, and 427 in 1906. 222 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There were no prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. In all 708 inspections were made of 374 factories, and 52 notices, 50 intimation and two statutory, were served. The total number of the workshops on the Register was 1,690, 144 of which were workshop laundries, 128 workshop bakehouses, and 1,418 other workshops. In all 3,059 inspections of these were made, compared with 3,346 in 1910, 3,366 in 1909, 3.130 in 1908, 3,148 in 1907, 3,233 in 1906, and 2,628 in 1905, and 195 intimation and 15 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 1,094 and 1,879 inspections were made, while 157 intimation and 14 statutory notices were served. The total number of defects found was 614, including 13 cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses compared with 720 and 11 in 1910. To abate these nuisances 429 intimation and 33 statutory notices were served, all of which, with the exception of 15, were complied with at the end of the year. The 15 outstanding were complied with in the first month of this year. Excluding outworkers' premises 614 defects were found and 599 remedied, but only 402 intimation notices were served, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. + The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the lolal number of the lists received lrom those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty ol sending tzvo lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 227 In all, 124 lists were received twice in the year, containing the names and addresses of 52 contractors and 390 workmen and six lists once in the year, containing the names and addresses of 10 workmen. There has been a slight increase in the nnmber of outworkers employed by employers in the Borough during the year. The total number of addresses received from other Councils was 408, compared with 422 in 1910, 370 in 1909, 352 in 1908, 322 in 1907, and 173 in 1906, and 251 addresses were forwarded to pother Councils, compared with 253 in 1910, 334 in 1909, 301 in 1908, 325 in 1907, and 122 in 1906'. The number of addresses received has decreased by 14, and the number sent by two. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers :—Lambeth 64, Stepney 34, Battersea 41, Southwark 14, City of London 23, Fill ham 16, Croydon 15, Chelsea six, Bermondsey five, St. Pancras, Camberwell, Hammersmith and Hanwell three each, Stratford, Westminster and East Ham two each, West Ham, Richmond, Wimbledon, Willesden, Holborn, Worthing, Bromley, Eastleigh, Leyton, Islington and Stoke Newington, one each. 77 names and addresses were forwarded to this Borough in error, and are not included in the above Table. The number of notices sent to employers during the year was 76, compared with 100 in 1910, and these had a most satisfactory result. At the end of 1910 there were 314 outworkers' premises on the Register, 32 were added and 34 removed during the year, leaving 312 on the Register. 404 inspections were made of these premises during the year, and 29 notices, all for cleansing, were served and complied with. During the year 15 cases of infective diseases, seven of Scarlet Fever, one of Diphtheria, one of Erysipelas, and six of Chickenpox, were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers, compared with 14 in 1910, six in 1909, 22 in 1908, six in 1907, and rf.ix in 1906. 228 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In none of these cases was it necessary to make any order under Section no of the Factory and Workshop Act. TABLE CI. 4.—REGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five divisions: (1) factories, (2) workshops, (3) domestic workshops, (4) workplaces, and (5) outworkers' premises. The total number of inspections was 3,020, compared with 2,768 in 1910, 3,175 in 1909, 2,263 in 1908, 2,408 in 1907 and 1,964 in 1906, and re-inspections 1,141, compared with 1,534, I»I84, 1,394, and 1,649, a total of 4,161, compared with 4,302 in the previous year. 979 of the inspections and 212 of the re-inspections were in Clapham, 248 and 166 in Putney, 678 and 234 in Streatham, 241 and 78 in Tooting, and 874 and 451 in Wandsworth. No workshops where males were employed were notified to H.M. Inspector, but 26 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector, the majority of these having been previously entered on the Register. In all the workshops under the supervision of the male Inspectors only two cases of overcrowding were discovered, and these were at once remedied. In 91 of these factories and workshops the sanitary conveniences were found defective, in 10 they were insufficient, and in two they were not separate for the sexes. In 223 the workrooms were in a dirty condition, and in 245 other nuisances were found. For these 384 intimation and 32 statutory notices were served, and with the exception of 15 intimation and two statutory notices were complied with. These 15 intimation and two statutory notices were complied with in the early part of the year. No legal proceedings were necessary to enforce any of the above notices. 230 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE CII1. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. , Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

The total number of premises inspected was 1,740 (415 in Clapham, 223 in Putney, 459 in Streatham, 159 in Tooting, and 484 in Wandsworth). Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 233 176 inspections were made of factories, 905 of workshops, 65 of domestic workshops, 383 of workplaces, and 211 of outworkers' premises, while 172 premises were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. There were only three cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with one in 1910, two in 1909, four in 1908, four in 1907, five in 1906, 12 in 1905, and 17 in 1904, and these were at once abated. 17 were found to be in a dirty condition, compared with 30 in 1910, 56 in 1909, 25 in 1908, and 66 in 1907. In one workshop inspected during the year there was no separate water closets for the sexes, and in six factories and four workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in two factories, 12 workshops, seven workplaces, and one outworker's premises, and these were all abated. It was only necessary to serve 45 intimation notices and one statutory notice, and these were all complied with. 27 workshops and one domestic workshop where females were employed were reported to H.M.

There has again been a slight increase in the numbers, chiefly due to increase in the number of small laundries, 89 of these being now on the Register, compared with 82 in 1910. The total number of dressmakers and milliners, etc., shows a slight decrease compared with the previous year. The total number, viz. :—878 (168 in Clapham, 108 in Putney, 326 in Streatham, 84 in Tooting, and 192 in Wandsworth), is four more than in 1910, the greatest increase having occurred in Streatham, while there has been a decrease in Wandsworth.

During the year 54 inspections of Canal Boats were made, "but it was not necessary to serve any notices, as on inspection "the condition of all the boats was found to be satisfactory. Statement of Work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the past year 927 samples of foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, compared with 1,030 in 1909, 1,004 i'1 1908, 989 in 1907, and 905 in 1906. Of these 123 or 13.2 per cent. were reported to be adulterated, compared with 9*05 per cent, in 1910, 6.89 per cent. in 1909, 876 per cent. in 1908, 8.49 per cent. in 1907, and 9.29 per cent. in 1906. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 9.3, compared with 7.44 in 1910, 7.39 in 1909, 6.9 in 1908, and 10.97 in 1907. In 17 of the adulterated milk samples the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of the sale, decided not to prosecute the vendor, so that the percentages of prosecutions was 6.33, compared with 3.9 in 1910, 4 in 1909, 3.8 in 1908, and 5.9 in 1907. In 77 out of the 123 cases in which adulterations were detected proceedings were instituted against the vendor, compared with 55 in 1910, 44 in 1909, and 50 in 1908. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year amounted to £244 12s. od., and the costs to £55 7s. 6d., making a total of £299 19s. 6d., compared with £154 us. 0d. in 1910, and £92 5s. od. in 1909. A penalty of 40s. was inflicted on one vendor for an assault on an agent employed by the Inspector, with 12s. costs, and a penalty of £4 was inflicted on another vendor under the Merchandise Marks Acts for selling washing soda adulterated with Glauber's Salt, with £2 2s. od. costs, making a total of £8 14s. od., and a grand total of £308 13s. 6d. 240 Report of the Medical Officer oj Health.

From this table it will be seen that the average percentage of adulterations detected for the 10 years 1901-10 was 9 2 per cent., compared with 13-2 in 1911, an increase of no less than 4 per cent. This increase is partly due to the large amount of adulteration detected in milk and butter samples. There are also other factors which have a direct bearing on this increase, the chief being that the Inspector has made a determined effort to follow up the habitually fraudulent trader, with the result that no less than twenty of these, who had been convicted several times and in some cases imprisoned, have left the Borough. 246 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough together with the number taken per 1,000 of population, and the number of adulterations detected,, also the percentage of adulterations.

Milk and Cream. MILK. 586 samples of milk were procured during the year. 55, or 93 per cent. were found to be adulterated, of which 25 or 463 per cent. were deficient in original milk fat, and 24 or 43.6 per cent. were found to contain added water, three samples were both deficient in milk fat and contained added water, and in four samples preservatives were detected. In 37 cases proceedings were taken against the vendor of the adulterated sample, and penalties amounting to £101 5s. od. were inflicted, with costs amounting to £26 12s. od., the penalties ranging from 5s. to £20 with costs. 23 samples of milk were procured on delivery at Public Institutions situated within the Borough and only one sample was reported against. Proceedings were taken against the milk contractor supplying the milk, who however, successfully pleaded a warranty. 24 samples of milk were procured whilst in course of delivery at various Railway Stations within the Borough, this milk being consigned from farmers in the country to retailers within the Borough, and in every case the sample was well above the standard. 12 samples of milk were taken whilst in course of transit, or on delivery from the wholesale dairy companies to the retailer and in each case the milk was of good quality. 17 samples of milk were procured on delivery at private houses, of which 9 or 53 per cent. were found to be adulterated. Proceedings were taken against seven of the vendors and convictions obtained in each case. 249 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the result of the analysis of the samples as above stated at various Public Institutions, Railway Stations, Retailers' Premises and Private Houses, with the percentage of adulteration in each case.

Private Houses 17 9 53 157 samples of milk have been taken on Sundays either in the early morning or at mid-day. 17, or 10 per cent. were reported against as being adulterated. Proceedings were taken against 11 of the vendors with the result that convictions were obtained in each case. 310 samples of milk were procured during the early mornings on week days. Of these 36 or 11.2 per cent. were found to be adulterated. Proceedings were taken in 21 cases and convictions obtained. In five cases proceedings were taken against the vendors for selling milk from a receptacle upon which their name and address were not conspicuously inscribed. Four of these were convicted, while one absconded before service of summons. I am pleased to report that in no case during the year has the inspector been obstructed in the course of his duty and no "refusal to sell" a sample for analysis has taken place. 250 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In nine cases the defendants relied on a warranty, but in four cases only were the defendants able to satisfy the Magistrate that the milk was sold in the same condition as received. The following Table shows the number of milk samples taken, the number found adulterated and the percentage of adulteration, together with the average adulteration for the years 1901-10 compared with the year 1911.

In 10 cases the Public Health Committee alter considering the various circumstances, such as conditions of sale and the amount of preservative, decided not to prosecute but to caution the vendors. In two cases proceedings were instituted against the vendors. In one instance the vendor was find £3 and costs and in the second case the summons was withdrawn owing to the reserve sample having burst. Butter and Margarine. BUTTER. 189 samples of butter were analysed by the Public Analyst during the year of which 31 or 16.4 per cent. were reported against, compared with 7.23 per cent. in 1910 and 5.35 per cent. in 1909, thus showing a very great increase. Here again the Inspector has made a vigorous effort to follow up the fraudulent trader. In two instances during the year the trader was not deterred by his first conviction, but continued to pursue his practice of substituting margarine when butter was demanded by the purchaser, and in these cases second and third convictions weie obtained. In 31 cases proceedings were instituted against the vendors and convictions obtained. The total amount of penalties including costs received amounted to £113 4s. od., these penalties ranging from £1 to £25 and costs. It is satisfactory to report that of all the butter samples examined not one was found to contain any excess of moisture or preservative. Six samples of butter were purchased from butter hawkers and four of the six were adulterated. These men go from door to door in some of the best parts of the Borough and represent that "25- Repori of the Medical Officer of Health. they are farmers selling their own dairy produce. This so-called butter sold at from is. id. to is. 4d. per lb. proved to be entirely margarine, probably worth about 4d. or 5d. per lb., and is usually done up in every way to represent dairy butter, with the impression of a cow or other object stamped on the top. These men are usually very difficult to catch, being provided with a pony and trap, and they move very quickly from district to district never returning at regular intervals. The Inspector reports that he has waited whole days in districts where these men are known to sell their goods, without result. The Inspector was successful in catching two of these traders during the year, and in one case the defendant was find £3 4s. od., and in the other £5 and £2 3s. 6d. costs. Within two months of this last mentioned conviction the vendor was seen by the Inspector trading in an adjoining Borough. Information was at once given to the Inspector of that Borough with the result that the vendor was still found to be carrying on his dishonest business. Proceedings were again taken against him with the result that he was convicted and fined £14 and £2 17s. 6d. costs. Much valuable information has been received from the Food Inspectors of neighbouring Boroughs concerning traders, especially itinerant milk vendors and butter hawkers, and the Inspector has likewise given information and assisted by giving evidence at Police Courts for Inspectors of adjoining Boroughs.

Five samples of margarine were submitted for analysis, one of which was reported against. There were four convictions in connection with the sale of margarine, one for exposing margarine for sale without having it properly labelled, and three for selling margarine in an unstamped wrapper, the fines and costs inflicted amounting to £6 10s. 0d. 254 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Cheese. Two samples of cheese were submitted for analysis and in both cases were returned as genuine. The Inspector reports that the sale of gorgonzola cheese, particulars of which were given in the Report for 1910, has been discontinued, for in no case during the year has any of this article been seen exposed for sale, the Inspector keeping a sharp look out during his many visits to shops in the Borough. Lard. Three samples of lard were submitted for analysis and all three were returned as genuine. Bread. One sample of standard bread was analysed and proved to be genuine. Flour. During the year under review the Local Government Board issued a report on the presence of calcium sulphate in baking powders and self-raising flour. The report, which was by Dr. J. M. Hamill, recommended certain limits of calcium sulphate in baking powders and self-raising flour. The Inspector was therefore instructed to procure samples and two samples of self-raising flour and nine samples of baking powder were examined, and one of flour and one of baking powder were found to contain an excess of calcium sulphate. The following circular was then issued, and a copy sent to all traders who sold baking powders or self-raising flour. "The attention of the Wandsworth Borough Council has beer called to the large amount of Calcium Sulphate in some samples of Baking Powder and Self-Raising Flour which have been submitted to the Public Analyst. 255 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The Council desires to point out that the 'Acid Phosphate' used in the preparation of these articles should not contain more than 10 per cent, of Calcium Sulphate, and hereby gives notice that the question of taking proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act will be considered in any cases in which it is found that the amount of Calcium Sulphate in the Phosphate employed in making such Baking Powder or Self-Raising Flour exceeds the above percentage. HENRY GEORGE HILLS, Town Clerk. Council House, Wandsworth, S.W. May, ign." Coffee. 10 samples of coffee were procured for analysis, one sample having been reported as adulterated. Proceedings were taken against the vendor, who was fined £2 and costs. Coffee Mixtures. Seven samples of coffee and chicory were analysed, in six the proportion of coffee and chicory was about equal, in one case reported against the Public Analyst stated that the sample contained 93 per cent. of chicory and seven per cent, of coffee. Proceedings were taken against the vendor, who at the hearing of the summons requested that the reserve sample be analysed by the Government Analyst, who subsequently stated that in his opinion the sample was genuine, the proportion of coffee and chicory being about equal, the summons was therefore withdrawn. Cocoa. Six samples of cocoa were submitted for analysis and all were returned fis genuine. 256 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Sugar. 10 samples of sugar were analysed, one of which was reported against. This sample was purchased as Demerara sugar, but on analysis proved to be dyed or coloured crystals. In this case the vendor was cautioned. Drugs. 10 samples of drugs, which included two prescriptions, were taken and one sample was reported against. This was a sample of Gregory's powder which was not prepared in accordance with the requirements of the British Pharmacepoeia. No action was taken against the vendor in this case, as the adulteration was not a serious one, being the substitution of magnesium carbonate for magnesium oxide. Other Articles. 77 samples classified under this heading were procured for analysis, and 20 or 25-9 per cent, were reported against. The chief adulterations occurred in the tinned or canned foods, in which a small amount of metallic contamination was detected, but in no case was the amount considered injurious to health. 12 samples of rice were analysed, all of which were reported to be free from "facing." 12 samples of sausage and prepared meats were analysed for preservatives, and it is very satisfactory to state that 10 of the samples were found to be entirely free from preservatives, whilst the two cases reported against contained only a very small amount of preservative. A comparison of this year's percentage of 16.6 against that for 1910, which was 58, shows that the proceedings which were very reluctantly taken against several vendors for adding an excessive amount of preservative to prepared meats, have done a great deal of good in checking this form of adulteration. 257 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Six samples of common washing soda were analysed, but as this article was not a food or a drag, it was necessary to procure the samples, and take proceedings under the Merchandise Marks Act. Two samples were reported as being adulterated with sulphate of soda or what is known as Glauber's salts, this salt being about one half the price of ordinary washing soda. Glauber's salt is useless for the purpose for which washing soda is used, in fact, the percentage found in the samples quite neutralised the softening effect of the genuine soda with which it was mixed. Proceedings were taken against the vendors of the two samples reported against as being adulterated. The first case heard resulted in a conviction, the defendant being fined £4 and £2 2s. 0d. costs. The Inspector appointed to carry out the work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts has done admirable work during the year and has been the means of stopping certain forms of adulteration which were prevalent and which were extremely difficult to discover. The year 1911 was an exceptionally busy one, not only as regards the executive duties of the staff, but also as regards the clerical work. The exceptional prevalence of Measles, Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea, as well as the new duties which devolved on the staff with regard to Pulmonary Tuberculosis largely increased the work, but I am pleased to be able to report that it has all been carried out in a most satisfactory manner. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, I Medical Officer of Health. ANNUAL STATEMENT Of the work done in the Borough of Wandsworth under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, summarised from the statutoryquarterly reports. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, In presenting the Annual Statement of the work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, during the year 1911, it is in the fisrt place my sad duty to record the death of the Public Analyst, my father, Dr. John Muter, which occurred on December 19th. From that date to the end of the year the work has been carried on by me, and it is in my capacity as Public Analyst to the Borough for the first three months of the present year that I have prepared this statement The total number of samples submitted by the Inspector Number of samples submitted. during tne year amounted to 927. Of these, 919 were taken with the formalities required by the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts; six were taken under the Merchandise Marks Act, whilst the remaining two were procured informally. It is a noteworthy fact that both these informal samples were "Informal samples. iound to be adulterated, tne nrst, sold as butter, proving to be entirely margarine; the second bought as milk, proving to be a mixture of 42 parts of milk with 58 parts of water. Incidentally, this sample provided the most gross case of adulteration met with during the year in relation to the milk supply. The statement following gives the result of analyses of all articles submitted. In Table A will be found the details of the articles grouped together in the main statement under the heading "Drugs" and "Other Articles," whilst Tables B, C, and D give details of all adulterated samples, and are further amplified in the context. 26o Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In no instance, however, did the quantity of this preservative exceed 0.5 per cent.(equivalent to 35.0 grains per lb.). As regards the milk samples (all classes) the greatest adulteration in respect of added water occurred in the case of the "informal" sample already referred to, namely, 58 per cent. extraneous water; followed closely by sample No. 630 which was 263 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. found to contain 48 per cent. The greatest deficiency in milk fat occurred in the case of sample No. 4 (sold as skim milk), where it amounted to 88 per cent. Samples No. 412 and No. 438 ranked next with 46 per cent, and 40 per cent, deficiency respectively. The details of all adulterated samples grouped under this heading are given in Table B. All milks were systematically examined for the presence of The presence of preservatives. preservatives, but in lour instances only were positive results obtained, two being found to contain very small amounts of a boron preservative, and two a formalin preservative.

Articles other than Milk, Cream, and Butter. Of the samples submitted other than milk, cream, and butter, the number amounted to 136. Of these, 25, or 183 per cent., were reported as adulterated or not up to the standard, and full details concerning these are given in Table D. The two samples included under the heading "Flour" were The presence of Calcium 8ulphatc in Baking Powder and Self-raising Flour. both "Self-raising" Flours. These, together with the nine samples of Baking Powder, were submitted on account of the publication during the year of Dr. J. M. Hamill's Report to the Local Government Board " On the presence of Calcium Sulphate in Baking Powder and Selfraising Flour." It will be seen that two only of the samples (Flour Sample No. 371 and Baking Powder Sample No. 374) were reported as containing this impurity in excess of the amount recommendcel as permissible in the Report referred to. A series of tinned goods were submitted and examined, with Metallic contamination in tinned goods. special reterence to metallic contamination, but in no case was the quantity of dissolved tin found to exceed 2'0 grains per lb. It is satisfactory to note that of the ten samples of Sausages Preservatives In Sausages. submitted, two only this year were found to contain a preservative, consisting in both instances of Boric Acid. Ten samples of " Drugs " were examined, adulteration being Drugs. reported in but one case; namely, Gregory s Powder, sample No. 119, where Magnesium Carbonate had been employed in its preparation instead of Magnesium Oxide. The six samnles referred to as beiner taken under the Washing Soda. Merchandise Marks Act consisted of Washing Soda. Of these, four proved to be genuine, and two adulterated. The latter, samples No. 510 and No. 512, were found to contain 68.69 per cent. and 45.42 per cent., respectively, crystallised sodium sulphate, an inert substance devoid of detergent properties.
