Dear Sirs, Reference my Annual Report for the year 1946 forwarded to you a few days ago. As they were delayed some considerable period by the printer, they were dispatched immediately they were received. It was afterwards noticed that my qualifications were shown on the front cover and first page as being M.D., P.H.. This is incorrect and a printers error, and I should be most grateful if you would amend your copy to read as follows:- "M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H." Yours faithfully, Medical Officer of Health.

Staff of Public Health Department 5 iii 2 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Erith. 1 have the honour to present, on behalf of my predecessor Dr. R. A. Leader who resigned in October, 1946, the seventh Annual Report for the year 1946. I did not take up duties as your Medical Officer of Health until March, 1947. I would draw your attention to the rise in the birth rate from 19.13 to 22.3 for 1946, and to the marked drop in Infantile Mortality from 39.61 in 1945 to 32.3 in 1946, which indicates an improvement in the mental state and general health of mothers, which is in no small measure due to the high quality and adequacy of the personal services in maternity and child welfare spheres rendered by the staff of the Health Department. A new figure marking the popularity of maternity services has been introduced, which shows that during 1946, of the 981 births 18 comprised 9 sets of twins, making a total of 972 mothers. Thus we have the high figure of 939 mothers out of a possible 972 who used the Council's Ante-Natal Services. This works out at 80.3 per cent. Such is a figure of which Erith may well be proud and indicates a consciousness in the minds of present-day mothers of the need for care and advice during pregnancy. Is it not a 'sine qua non' that where a service is popular then it must be good ? It will be noticed that once again more than 50 per cent. of the births occurring in the Borough have taken place at the Council's own Maternity Home at Hainault. I venture to say that this institution has rendered invaluable service to the borough, especially in these times when the housing problem is so acute, which position I feel has shown very little improvement since reporting on in detail by my predecessor in last year's report. I notice, too, that your attention was drawn last year to the entire absence of maternal deaths. This has been repeated in 1946. It might be safe to say that the health barometer in any district is its death rate, and a perusal of these will show that Erith, with 10.4 from all causes, compares very favourably indeed with the total of 11.5 for England and Wales and 11.7 3 for smaller towns with a resident population of from 25-50,000. That there must be a death rate is obvious, and to find Erith with such a remarkably low figure, bearing in mind also that a large percentage of these are in upper age groups, at which time of life more deaths are expected, is indeed very gratifying. The infectious disease records show only a very slight increase and there has been no evidence of any epidemics during, the year, no deaths having been recorded on the death returns from Diphtheria or Whooping Cough. I am looking forward to my next year's report, when I feel that after a year's working in yout midst I shall be better able to give more detailed information on the Health Services of this Borough, when at the time of writing it we shall no doubt have very close upon us the advent of the new National Health Service, when it might be possible to make some comparison with the services offered by the new Act, and those already existing within the Borough. In conclusion, I would like to thank, on your behalf, the whole of the staff of this Department which comprises approximately 112 indoor and outdoor staff. I feel sure that I am right in saying that it is due to their loyalty, co-operation and efficient carrying out of their duties that the services have run along smoothly in spite of any changes which have taken place at the helm. I have the honour to be, the Council's Obedient Servant, C. G. K. THOMPSON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 H (2). MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES. Health Committee. Councillor W. Alford, Mayor. Councillor W.

B (1). Clinics functioned normally throughout the year, as did the Specialist Clinics, but the total attendances were again increased by over 2,400 as compared with the previous year, the attendances in each clinic showing an increase. 30 E(5)j. Hop Pickers. There are no hop fields within the district. E(5)k. Rag Flock Act. No premises exist within the Borough in which rag flock is manufactured. E(5)l. Eradication of Bed Bugs. During the year 1946, dwellinghouses as follows were found to be infested with vermin and subsequently disintested: Privately owned houses 17 Corporation houses 3 Presence of vermin in private houses is usually located by Sanitary Inspectors during their inspections. On every occasion, the removal of wallpaper, picture rails, etc. is insisted upon and measures falling short of this has been found to be useless. The use of the blow lamp and approved insecticides is advocated and re-visits are made with a view to effecting maintenance of the improvement. Owners and occupiers are encouraged to report vermin infestations in which case, the services of the out-door assistant may be obtained. For an appropriate charge, the assistant carried out the necessary disinfestation. The cleansing and disinfestation of corporation houses is under the control of the Housing Manager, the work being carried out by the Borough Surveyor's Staff. E(5)m. Cleansing of Verminous Persons. The cleansing station at the first aid post operates in connection with the above and all persons suffering from scabies are directed to this site. E(5)n. Pest Control. (a) Mosquitoes. No specimens were submitted to the Malaria Officer of the Ministry of Health with a view to identification. (b) General.—Colorado beetle. A specie resembling the above was forwarded to the Ministry of Agriculture station at Harpenden for identification. Such exhibit was confirmed as type Necrophorus—a burying beetle. E(5)o. Rodent Control. Ministry of Food Circulars N.S.11 (sewers) N.S.12 (private dwellings). Circular N.S-11. Following upon initial treatment for sewer rat in October, 1945, the first maintenance treatment was carried out in 31 September, 1946. In all, 113 sewer manholes were dealt with, the technique being based on the recommendations of the Ministry of Food i.e. pre-bait being laid on Monday and Tuesday—poisoning on Wednesday, and recording results on Thursday. Circular N.S.12. This scheme was duly adopted by the Council, and on the 27th August, 1946, the Ministry of Food accepted the Local Authority's proposals with regard to the application of the measures involved. By the end of the year, local arrangements had been made for the survey of dwellings and other premises to proceed. HOUSING. E(6)a. Inspection of Dwelling Houses during year. 1.
