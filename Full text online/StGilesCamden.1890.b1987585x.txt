During the past year 95 Meetings of the Board and of its Committees have taken place, of which the following are details :— Board Meetings- Ordinary 23 Special 2 Total — 25 Committee Meetings— Finance 23 Law and Parliamentary 8 Sanitary 14 Works . 24 Special . 1 Making a Total of . 95 meetings From this list it will be observed that the business which has come under the consideration of the Board has been of such a character that during the past year more frequent meet- 9 lugs have been necessary, and they have invariably occupied more time than previously. Change in the Personnel of the Board. During the past year several gentlemen who had been members of the Board for a considerable time and who had taken an active interest in parochial administration have died or removed from the District. Prominent amongst them are the names of Mr. Thomas Barrett and Mr. William Henry Perryman. Mr. Barrett has ceased to be a member of the Board in consequence of his having retired from business and left the District. The hearty good wishes of his colleagues were tendered to him on his retirement, and the hope was expressed that he would live for many years to enjoy his well-earned rest. The loss which the District sustained in the death of Mr. Perryman was one which will not be easily replaced, for Mr. Perryman had been most assiduous in discharging the duties of the various offices which he took upon himself, and was a most regular and punctual attendant at the meetings of the various Boards of which he was for so long time a member. To the foregoing names must be added that of Mr. Charles Park, who had been for several years a member of the Board, and had filled the chair of the Finance Committee. Mr. Park ceased to be a member of the Board in consequence of having left the District. Although not within the year under consideration, the deaths have also occurred of Mr. Thomas Davies and Mr. John Henry Burlingson, to whom reference will be made on a future occasion. 10 There is every probability, in consequence of members retiring from business or leaving the District, of considerable changes taking place, and it is to be feared that within the next few years many of those who have served for a considerable time are likely to vacate their seats. The members who have been elected to fill the vacancies which have thus been caused have shown their willingness to take upon themselves their fair share of the work and to endeavour as far as possible to procure the efficient conduct of the business of the District. The Past Year. 1890-1891 was promised as the year which would see district councils constituted in the metropolis, but owing to circumstances which have prevented no measure dealing with the subject has yet been introduced into either of the Houses of Parliament, and the district boards and vestries which have for so long a time been existing, and which have, it is maintained, faithfully discharged the duties conferred upon them, still continue to exist. So far as the St. Giles District is concerned, the Board have been called upon to discuss a very considerable amount of important business and have had to deal with a multitude of minor matters, all of which required a great deal of consideration. Annual Accounts. The accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the Board to the 25th March, 1891, have been prepared in the usual form, and have been examined by the Board's chartered accountant, and were in due course submitted to the elected auditors, by whom they were certified as correct, as will be seen by the auditors' certificate which is contained at the 11 end of the accounts which appear in this volume on pages 24 to 39. One of the largest items which appears in the accounts is that of the precept of the School Board for London, which during the year under review amounted to the sum of £17,056 12s. 10d., and which the Board regret to say will not, in all probability, be reduced during the present year. The election of the School Board will take place in November next, and it is to be hoped that the electors will take a more serious view of the matter than they have hitherto done, and that they will elect persons to represent them who, while having due regard to the necessity for efficiency, will yet procure some reduction in the present expenditure of the School Board for London. One half of the salary of the Medical Officer of Health is now paid by the London County Council, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act of 1888. The other items in the accounts are of much the usual character, and with the exception of the expenses connected with the St. Giles Churchyard they are not items upon which it is necessary to make any special comment. The St. Giles Churchyard. In the last Report it was stated that the proposals made by the Board for taking a lease of the Churchyard had been accepted by the Rector and Churchwardens and approved by the Vestry. Since then the lease has been completed and has been confirmed by a faculty, which has also sanctioned the necessary alterations and improvements which have since been carried out; not, however, without considerable difficulty, in consequence of the extremely inclement weather. The works that have been executed are considered on all hands to be a very great improvement, and it is hoped that the Churchyard will shortly be opened for the enjoyment of the public. Vacant Land in Shaftesbury Avenue. The northernmost piece of land in Shaftesbury Avenue has at last passed into the hands of the Board, and the works connected with the laying out of the same as an open space have been arranged for and are now in progress. The southernmost piece of land is to be devoted to the construction of an underground place of public convenience for men and women, the plans of which, having been prepared by the Engineer and Surveyor to the Board, have recently received the approval of the London County Council. The necessary legal formalities connected with the transfer of the land are now taking place and tenders for the execution of the work will shortly be invited. Maintenance of Main Roads. In the last Report, at pages 12 and 13, the communications which had been made to the London County Council on the subject of the maintenance of what were claimed by the Board to be Main Roads in the District were referred to, and, as was then stated in a footnote, the London County Council declined to accede to the Board's application that the thoroughfares mentioned should be declared main roads. The decision arrived at caused the very gravest dissatisfaction and is felt to be in distinct opposition to the motives which influenced the insertion of the provisions relating to the subject in the Local Government Act, and the Board have 13 referred the matter to the Law and Parliamentary Committee for consideration and report with a view of being advised as to the best course to be pursued in the matter. Housing of the Working Classes. Towards the close of the session of 1890 the President of the Local Government Board introduced into the House of Commons Bills for amending and consolidating the law relating to the Housing of the Working Classes. The Bills were carefully considered by the Board and certain representations were made to the Local Government Board upon the subject. The changes which were introduced were of considerable importance and conferred upon the Local Authorities large powers for dealing with insanitary dwellings. The two Bills were subsequently consolidated into one measure, and under the title of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, received the Royal Assent on the 18th day of August, 1890. The Board immediately empowered their Officers to take the necessary steps to carry the Act into effect, and if reference is made to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health it will be seen that considerable works have already been carried out under the provisions of this measure. The Shelton Street Area. In the last Report it was stated that the work of demolishing the premises on the above area (which was one in respect of which an improvement scheme was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works) were being proceeded with. Shortly after the Report was prepared, it came to the knowledge of the Board that the London County Council, instead 14 of erecting tenement dwelling houses, proposed to appropriate a large portion of the site for the construction of a common lodging house with accommodation for about 320 persons. Seeing that at the time in question there were 50 common Lodging Houses in the district capable of accommodating 1,810 persons, and having regard to the necessity that existed for tenement accommodation in the neighbourhood, the Board felt it to be their duty to make representations to the Secretary of State for the Home Department upon the subject, with a view of inducing him not to sanction so large a portion of the site being devoted to the purpose proposed. A letter was accordingly addressed to the Secretary of State upon the subject, and subsequently a deputation attended at the Home Office in support of the same. They were introduced by Mr. Gainsford Bruce, Q.C., M.P., who very clearly laid before the Under Secretary of State, Mr. Stuart Wortley, M.P., the Board's views, but subsequently a communication was received, in which the Secretary of State intimated that he did not see his way to withhold his sanction to the proposed arrangement. In consequence of this deviation from the original plan for re-housing the persons dispossessed by the scheme, certain further modifications were resolved upon by the London County Council, and they applied to the Home Secretary to make a Provisional Order, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, sanctioning their proposals. The provisions were firstly, that Shelton Street should be stopped up, with the exception of a short length at the western end, which was to remain the same width, and between which and Parker Street a new street, 20 feet wide, was to be constructed. Secondly, that certain strips of land in MackJin Street should not be devoted to the purpose of Artizans' 15 Dwellings, but should be let in connection with other land adjacent thereto for commercial purposes, unless it should thereafter be determined that they should be used for the purpose of widening that thoroughfare. Thirdly, that certain pieces of land which were purchased, not as insanitary properties, but for the express purpose of enabling the improvement scheme to be carried out, should not be devoted to the purpose of the scheme, but should be sold or leased for commercial purposes ; and fourthly, that the obligation which the Council were under to re-house 660 persons should be reduced to 608. The Board were not in any way consulted with reference to these proposed alterations in the original scheme, nor were they aware of the intentions of the Home Secretary upon the matter, until the Bill for confirming the Provisional Order, which was made in the exact terms proposed by the London County Council, had been introduced into the House of Commons. The matter was immediately taken up and reported upon by the Officers of the Board, who were directed to place themselves in communication with Mr. Gainsford Bruce, Q.C., M.P., with a view to some modification being made in the proposals of the London County Council. Mr. Gainsford Bruce entered very heartily into the Board's views upon the matter, and rendered most valuable assistance ; by his advice a memorandum against the second reading of the Bill for confirming the Provisional Order was prepared by the officers of the Board, and was circulated among the Metropolitan Members of Parliament. The Bill was, however, read a second time, it being maintained in the House of Commons on behalf of the London County Council that the subject was one which could far better be dealt with by a Select Committee than by the House, and 16 the motion for the rejection of the Bill, which had been moved by Mr. Gainsford Bruce, was therefore negatived. The Clerk to the Board was then instructed to take the necessary steps as Solicitor to the Board for opposing the Bill before the Select Committee to whom it was referred, but some negotiations having taken place between the Solicitor to the Board and a Committee of the London County Council, very considerable modifications of the Council's proposals were agreed to as follows : firstly, that the eastern end of Shelton Street and the connecting portion of Brewer Street should be stopped up; secondly, that in the buildings to be erected, fronting on the new street connecting the western end of Shelton Street with Parker Street, no windows, doors or apertures of any description were to be opened; thirdly, Parker Street was to be widened from Hansard's Premises at the eastern end to Gain's seed warehouse at the western end to 40 ft.; and fourthly, the pieces of land in Macklin Street which were proposed to be used for commercial purposes should be conveyed to the Board and thrown into the public way. It was felt that although these suggestions did not entirely meet the views of the Board, yet they were such substantial concessions on the part of the Council that the Board decided to accept them, and further opposition to the Bill having been rendered unnecessary it was, as amended, passed by the House of Commons. It was admitted on all hands in the House of Commons that the works connected with the area had been a very long time in hand, and it is to be sincerely hoped that no further time will be lost in erecting buildings on the area, and thus providing accommodation the want of which is so much felt at the present time, 17 Parliamentary Schemes. This subject may be conveniently dealt with under two headings, viz., (a) Public Bills and (b) Private Bills. (a) PUBLIC BILLS. The following is a list of the more important of the Bills introduced during the past year :— Slaughter Houses (Metropolis) Act, 1874, Amendment Bill. Hops (Substitutes) Bill. Beer (Adulteration) Bill. School Board for London (Superannuation) Bill. Street Organs (Metropolis) Bill. Cheap Trains (London) Bill. Poor Rate Metropolis (Equalization) Bill. School Board for London (Elections) Bill. Metropolis Local Management Acts (Amendment) Bill. Factory and Workshops Bill. Water Companies Charges Bill. General Paving Metropolis Act, 1817 (Amendment) Bill. Public Health (London) Law Amendment Bill. Public Health (London) Law Consolidation Bill. Destitute Parents Bill. The whole of these Bills were referred by the Board to the Law and Parliamentary Committee, and the officers reported upon their provisions. In most instances petitions were presented either in favour of or against the measures, while in other cases communications were addressed to the Heads of the Government Department or the members introducing the Bills in question. (b) PRIVATE BILLS. I. THE GAS LIGHT AND COKE COMPANY'S FURTHER POWERS BILL. This Bill proposed to confer powers upon the Gas Light and Coke Company as to their right to enter premises occupied by persons who had failed to pay for their gas. c 18 The Board felt that the provisions contained in the Bill were of such an arbitrary character and would be so highly objectionable that they determined to oppose the Bill. A petition was accordingly presented against the same, but before it had passed the second reading the Bill was withdrawn. II. LONDON OVERHEAD WIRES BILL. This Bill when first introduced was in very much the same form as the Bill which had been introduced by the London County Council in the session 1889-1890, when the Bill was thrown out on third reading. The Board felt that certain further alterations were necessary, and they therefore appeared before the Committee of the House of Commons, and it is satisfactory to state that the ground they took up was maintained and the modifications which were sought for were granted by the Select Committee. III. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL GENERAL POWERS BILL. The Bill proposed to confer further powers on the London County Council with regard to various of their duties, but not in any way affecting the St Giles District, and no action was therefore taken upon it. IV. LONDON SKY-SIGNS BILL. This Bill proposed to restrict the erection of sky-signs in the Metropolis. The Board felt that this method of advertising was likely to lead to very considerable objection and was very dangerous, and also believed that many of the signs were in a very unsafe condition The Board therefore petitioned in favour of the Bill, and the measure has since been confirmed by the House of Commons V. THE CENTRAL LONDON RAILWAY BILL This was a Bill for the formation of an electric railway from Shepherd's Bush to the Bank of England, very much 19 on the lines of the measure promoted during the previous session of Parliament. The railway was proposed to be constructed at a considerable depth below the surface, and the clauses which the Board had succeeded in obtaining inserted in the Bill of last session having been again introduced, the opposition was confined to one point, namely, as to the situation of the station which it was proposed to construct at the corner of Bloomsbury Court and High Holborn. The Board suggested that if this was to be done it would be necessary that some widening of the first named thoroughfare should take place, but upon the matter being brought before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, after a short discussion they intimated that they were not prepared to accede to the suggestions made on behalf of the Board, and all further opposition to the measure was then abandoned. VI. METROPOLIS WATER SUPPLY BILL. METROPOLIS WATER COMMISSION BILL. These two Bills and the Bills for regulating the supply of water by meter and for regulating the powers of water companies were all referred to one Committee, together with certain other Water Bills not affecting the St. Giles District. No definite decision has yet been arrived at upon them. The Electric Lighting Acts, 1882-1888. During the past year the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, have laid a large number of mains within the District. Full particulars of the work will be found set forth in the Report of the Engineer and Surveyor to the Board. St, Giles Burial Ground. A small portion of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was, until recently, surrounded on all sides by property in the c 2 20 parish of St. Pancras. It was situated in the Old St. Pancras Road and consisted of the old burial ground of St. Giles-inthe-Fields and certain houses in Adam and Eve Terrace. The interest of the Rector and Churchwardens of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields in the burial ground was, some years since, conveyed to the Guardians of St. Pancras, and during the past year the Local Government Board have, on application by the Vestry of St. Pancras, under the Divided Parishes Act, transferred this property to the parish of St. Pancras, and it therefore now ceases to form part of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. Re-numbering of Streets. During the past year orders have been made by the London County Council abolishing the names of Dudley Street, Bloomsbury Street, and Thorney Street, and re-naming the thoroughfare Shaftesbury Avenue, and for the re-numbering of the houses therein. Also abolishing the name of Crown Street, re-naming the thoroughfare Charing Cross Road and re-numbering the houses therein. An order was also made for the re-numbering of the houses in West Street. In all these cases the necessary orders for carrying out the alterations have been made by the Board and duly complied with. Obstructions and Projections on the Public Way. This subject has again during the past year engaged the most serious attention of the Board and its Committees. The Regulations dealing with the matter have been revised, and in some cases proceedings have been taken against offenders. It is to be hoped that the steps which the Board have decided to take upon the matter will be such as to remedy the nuisances which have been found to exist. 21 Sanitary Work. The details of the works which have been carried out under the Sanitary and N uisances Removal Acts, and in connection with the regulations made by the Board as to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, will be found in the report of the Medical Officer of Health. In a few cases proceedings have been necessary ; in these it is again satisfactory for the Board to be able to record that the orders made were in every instance upheld by the magistrate, and in no single case during the year have any proceedings taken by the Board under the Sanitary Acts been held to be unnecessary. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. These Acts continue to be enforced within the District. 170 samples of Food have been purchased during the past year, consisting of milk, cream, butter, pepper and cheese; twenty samples were found to be adulterated. In 16' of these cases proceedings were taken before Police Magistrates. In the other cases the adulteration was of so trifling a nature that the vendors were simply cautioned. In all cases that were dealt with by Magistrates convictions were obtained. The total amount of fines and costs received was £14 14s. 7d. Dr. Redwood continues to act as Analyst to the Board, having been re-appointed on the 22nd day of July, 1890. His report of the work done under the Act will be found at page 23. While dealing with this subject it will be well to state that Mr. John Hoyle,who for many years acted as the Board's Inspector, having resigned, the work connected with the purchasing of samples has been transferred from the Surveyor's 22 to the Sanitary Department, and is now discharged by Sanitary Inspectors Bond and Robinson. The Board's Staff. During the year certain alterations have taken place in the Board's staff. As has been already stated, Mr. John Hoyle, who had been for many years one of the Board's Street Inspectors, resigned, and in consideration of his services the Board granted him a superannuation allowance amounting to the sum of £73 6s. 8d. per annum. Inspector Joseph Smith, who had for some years been Assistant Street Inspector, was promoted to the post formerly held by Mr. Hoyle ; some re-arrangement of the duties took place and Mr. H. M. Cockburn, who had been Inspector to the Willesden Local Board, was appointed as additional Street Inspector. Certain duties, which had hitherto been discharged in the Surveyor's Department in connection with the disinfecting of infected clothing, were transferred to the Sanitary Department, and, in like manner, the necessary duties in connection with the removal of dust were transferred from the Sanitary Department to the Surveyor's Department. The work in the Surveyor's Department having increased to a very considerable extent, an additional assistant was appointed, and a modification of the duties of the staff was approved by the Board. The present office accommodation is extremely inefficient, and it has been resolved that it is necessary to provide additional accommodation, but no actual decision upon the accommodation to be provided has yet been arrived at. HENRY C. JONES, Clerk to the Board. 11th June, 1890. 2:3 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST APPOINTED UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, During the year ending 25th March, 1891 I. received from your Inspectors, Messrs. J. Hoyle, J. Smith, J, Robinson and W. H. Bond, 192 samples for analysis, viz., 160 samples from Inspector Hoyle and 12 samples from J. Smith from April to the end of November, and ten samples each from Inspectors Bond and Robinson during the month of March. The samples consisted mostly of dairy products, including 150 samples of milk, one of cream, 2 of cheese and 22 samples of butter. Those of cream, cheese and butter were all not adulterated. Of the milk, 13 were classed by me as poor milk and 6 as very poor milk, whilst 5 samples were adulterated with 4 per cent. of added water, 3 with 5 per cent., 4 with 6 per cent., 2 with 7 per cent., 1 with 9 per cent., 1 with 10 per cent., 1 with 12 per cent., 1 with 16 per cent., 1 with 26 per cent., 1 with 35 per cent., 1 with 38 per cent. and one sample with as much as 44 per cent. of added water. The remaining 109 samples were not adulterated. The other samples received by me during the year were 7 of white pepper and 10 of coffee; white pepper was in every case genuine, whilst of the coffee 1 sample was adulterated with 10 per cent. of chicory and 1 with 40 per cent. of the same adulterant.

Bedford Square. Bernard Street Brunswick Square. Chenies Street. Marchmont Street. Russell Square. Upper Bedford Place. Upper Montague Street. Maintenance of Asphalte and Wood Carriage-way Pavements. During the year the question of the future maintenance of those asphalte pavements whose free maintenance were nearing expiration was considered by the Board, who resolved to call upon the respective Asphalte Companies to maintain the said pavements for a farther period of fifteen years. The following is a list of them, with the amount to be paid the companies in respect of the same. 43 Keppel Street 6d. per yard super per annum. Bedford Square, east side 8d ,, „ Museum Street, from New Oxford St. to Broad Street 6d „ „ Hunter Street 6d. ,, „ Great Russell Street, from Tottenham Court Rd. to Blooms- bury Street 6d. „ „ New Compton St. 6d. ,, „ Russell Square, east side, from Guilford St. to Bernard St. and triangular piece at southeast corner 6 d. „ „ Seven Dials 6d „ „ Your Board also entered into a contract with the Improved Wood Pavement Company, Limited, for the maintenance of the west side of Bloomsbury Square for a further period of fifteen years from 13th September, 1890, at an annual charge of 10d per yard superficial, this being 2d. a yard supeficial less than the agreed amount under the original contract. Obstructive Spur Stones. The question of the inconvenience and obstruction caused to the traffic by the existence of granite spur stones placed against certain of the lamp-posts and guard posts in the District was considered by your Board, who ultimately resolved " That all such spur stones as are obstructive should be removed." The work of removing these stones has since been commenced, and will be carried on from time to time as circumstances permit. Sewers, The following lengths of New Sewers were constructed during the year:— 44 Southampton Street Woburn Place Keppel Mews North (north end) 400 feet lineal of new brick sewer, 4 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. internal dimensions. 440 feet lineal of new brick sewer, 4 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. internal dimensions. 80 feet lineal of new brick sewer, 4 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. internal dimensions. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public ways was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were also used in sweeping the carriage-ways. Sixteen boys and one man as ganger were also employed in collecting the horse droppings from the surfaces of the several wood and asphalte pavements in the District during dry weather, and in wet and sloppy weather in cleansing the public footways within the District. Additional labour was also engaged when found necessary for the purpose of ballasting the asphalte carriage-ways and more frequently cleansing them when under certain atmospheric conditions they became greasy. Complaint was made during the year of paper and straw blowing about in the Squares of the District on Sundays, and as an experiment two men have been engaged on Sunday mornings in collecting into baskets all loose paper and other matters lying in the public ways of the Squares. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 5,839 van loads, equal to over 17,000 cubic yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares that are paved with wood and asphalte were washed frequently during the year by means of watering-carts and the machine brooms, • . 45 the cost of which washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. The following streets being market streets, and streets inhabited by the poorer classes, were cleansed on Sundays between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m., those streets in the list marked with an asterisk being cleansed a second time between 12 noon and 2.30 p.m. After the second cleansing the streets were watered with a weak solution of permanganate of potash:— Abbey Place. Arthur Street. Bainbridge Street. Castle Street. Colonnade. Kenton Street. Little Coram Street and Courts adjacent. Little Guilford Street. Marchmont Street. * Arthur Street. *Castle Street. *Church Passage. *Drury Lane. *Dyott Street. *Goldsmith Street. *Great Earl Street. *Great Wild Street. *Little Earl Street. *Little White Lion Street. *Little Wild Street. *Lloyd's Court. *Lumber Court. *Macklin Street. *Neal Street. * .Newton Street. *Parker Street. *Phœnix Street. *Queen Street. * Seven Dials. *Shelton Street. *Short's Gardens. * Smart's Building. *Stacey Street. *Tower Street. The following main thoroughfares were also cleansed on Sundays between 6 and 10 a.m., viz. :— Bloomsbury Square (south side). Bury Street. Charing Cross Road. Endell Street. Great Queen Street. Great St. Andrew Street. Hart Street. High Holborn. High Street. Little Queen Street. Little St. Andrew Street. New Compton Street. New Oxford Street. Shaftesbury Avenue. Southampton Row (from Blooms- bury Place to High Holborn). Theobald's Road. Tottenham Court Road. Vernon Place. 46 The main thoroughfares in the District were also watered twice on Sundays during the summer months between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. Removal of Snow. During the late winter snow fell frequently, and on several occasions to a considerable depth. The first fall occurred on Friday, November 28, when it averaged about 3 inches in depth. Additional men were immediately set to work to assist the Board's regular staff in clearing the public ways in the District, the snow being carted to the Victoria Embankment and thrown over the parapet walls into the River Thames, permission to do this having been previously obtained from the Thames Conservancy and the London County Council. The cost incurred was £173 4s. 2d. On December 15 another slight fall occurred, which was followed on December 19, by a heavy foll which necessitated the employment of a large number of casual labourers. The snow on this occasion averaged about 6 inches in depth, and this was added to during the following days by several slighter falls. The same measures were taken on this occasion as in the case of the snowfall of November, the snow being carted to the Thames Embankment and thrown into the river. The total additional labour in dealing with this fall amounted to 2,472 days, and the amount paid in wages was £370 5s. 9d. The total number of men, horses, and wagons employed by Mr. George Cookson, the Board's scavenging contractor, in removing the snow, 47 was 896, and the quantity of snow removed from the District was equal to about 8,258 cubic yards. Flushing the streets with water obtained from the New River Company's Mains, by means of hose was also resorted to for disposing of the snow in certain streets of the District and proved fairly effective. The total cost of these snowfalls, including labour, cartage, water for flushing, etc., amounted to £1,143 15s. 7d. On March 10 another fall occurred, averaging about 3 inches in depth, which was followed shortly afterwards by a further heavy fall amounting to an additional depth of 5 inches. Similar measures for dealing with it were taken as on the previous occasions, the whole of the Board's workmen, with a large number of extra labourers, being engaged in removing it. Flushing by means of water from the New River Mains was also again resorted to. The labour engaged in consequence of this fall was 717 days, and the amount paid for wages was £124 15s. lld. The total number of wagons and carts employed was 186, and the quantity of snow removed from the District equalled about 1,478 cubic yards. The water used amounted to 851,200 gallons. The number of streets cleansed by washing on this occasion was 35, containing a superficial area of about 50,000 square yards, The total cost of the work, including wages, cartage, water, etc., was £336 13s. l0d. Street-orderly Bins. No new street-orderly bins have been erected during the year. The bins now in the District number 30, and are situated as follows:— 48 Bedford Place 2 Bloomsbury Square 2 Bloomsbury Street 1 Charlotte Street 2 Hart Street 2 High. Holborn 4 High Street 1 Hunter Street 3 Little Queen Street 1 Montague Street 3 Museum Street 1 New Oxford Street 3 Russell Square (east side) 3 Southampton Row 2 Total 30 Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1890-91 was as follows:— £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 2,410 6 11 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 434 9 0 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street-sweeping machines 3,105 16 8 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, &c 1,467 18 3 Total £7,418 11 7 Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, 49 at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the District which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used (including that used for washing the streets) amounted to 4,346,000 gallons. During the hot summer months a small quantity of permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering-carts. £ s. d. The amount paid for water meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 204 3 9 To Contractors for horses, carts, and men 937 4 0 For Permanganate of Potash 22 10 0 Total £1,163 17 9 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,000. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the contractor's dustmen, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant being £11 10s. 0d. Limewhiting Courts. The walls to the following yards, courts, mews, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £46 10s. Od. E 50 Bernard Mews Middle Yard.

The public urinals in the District now number 16 and contain 49 compartments, 12 have water laid on to them; the others are without water supply. The whole are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen.

There are also 61 lamps of larger size at the corners of certain streets and on the crossing refuges, making a total of 1,112 public lamps in the District belonging to the Board. Your Board during the year considered the question of the cleansing of the tablets indicating the position of the fire-plugs attached to many of the public lamps in the District, and, after some negotiation, entered into an arrangement with the Gas Light and Coke Co., by which the Company undertakes to clean all such tablets for the sum of £ 10 per annum. As in previous years, the lamps in the main public ways within the District were lighted during dark and foggy days at a cost of £25 for the year. E 2 52 Electric Lighting. Under the Provisional Orders granted by the Board of Trade, and which was confirmed by Act of Parliament on 26th August, 1889, the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, has laid a considerable number of mains in connection with their station in Sardinia Street, to supply electricity within the District. The following is a list of the streets in which the mains have been laid up to the date of this report :— Bayley Street. Bedford Place. Bedford Square. Bloomsbury Square. Broad Street.

Hydraulic Power Mains. Under powers obtained from Parliament the London Hydraulic Power Co. has during the past year, with your Board's permission, laid mains in Little Russell Street, Hart Street, Bloomsbury Square (south side), Vernon Place, Southampton Row and Bucknell Street, to supply hydraulic pressure to certain new buildings in those streets. Fire Alarm Posts. The London County Council have with the permission of the Board placed fire-alarm posts during the year, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Drury Lane, and Russell Square. 54 St. Giles Churchyard, The Board having resolved to take over the Churchyard of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and to lay it out as a public garden, a faculty was obtained from the Bishop of London, and measures were at once taken for improving the Churchyard ; new paths have been formed and the existing paths repaired and made good and in some instances widened; the beds dug up and replanted with shrubs, and several additional trees added and grass seed sown. The entrance to the southern end of the ground has been improved, new stone steps having been formed and gates and railings erected. Your Board has also purchased several seats for placing in the Churchyard when it is opened to the public, and has appointed a caretaker to take charge of the yard. Application has been made to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, asking him to formally open the Churchyard, but his reply has not up to the time of writing been received. Contracts. The following Contracts for materials and works have been entered into by the Board, and are now in force:— Name and Address of the Contractor. Nature of Contract. Term of Contract. Mr. W.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I beg to present you my Annual Report upon the vital statistics and sanitary conditions of the district for the year ending December 31, 1890, a period of 53 weeks. For the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 and 26 Vic., chap. 102, St. Giles District comprises the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury. The whole area is computed to be a total of 245 acres. Under the provisions of the Births and Deaths Registration Acts the district is divided into 3 sub-districts, viz. :— 1. St. George, Bloomsbury.—The whole parish. 2. St. Giles, South.—That part of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields lying to the south of a line along the middle of Holborn and Broad Street, and to the east of a line along the middle of Great St. Andrew Street and Little St. Andrew Street. 3. St. Giles, North.—That part of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields not comprised in the foregoing. Vital Statistics.* In order to obtain correct vital statistics it is essential to have a correct enumeration of the population ; at the present * My Annual Report for 1890 was prepared at the beginning of the present year (before the Census, 1881-91, was taken in April), so that the statistical information relating to sickness and mortality could be forwarded to the Local Government Board within a reasonable time after the close of the year. 60 time it is difficult to procure this information, as an interval of nearly ten years has elapsed since the taking of the last Census, during which time many changes have taken place amongst the population, through the carrying out of numerous local improvements. I have, therefore, again made my calculations upon the corrected returns of the Census, 1881. Marriages and Marriage-rate, 347 marriages took place during the year at the parish churches and other buildings in the district licensed for the purpose. Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. Parish Church, St. Giles-in-the-Fields Established Church. 87 Parish Church, St. George, Bloomsbury ditto 108 Holy Trinity Church, Little Queen Street ditto 21 Christ Church, Woburn Square. ditto 6 Sardinia Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 28 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist . 11 Little Wild Street Chapel. ditto — Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street . ditto 4 Keppel Street Chapel ditto 1 Soho Baptist Chapel, Shaftesbury Avenue ditto 1 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan Methodist 1 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church 3 Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Superintendent-Registrar's Office, Unitarian 3 Broad Street. ... 73 Total number of marriages 347 The 694 persons married represent a marriage-rate of I 5'2 per 1,000, an increasing rate of 1.1 per 1,000 over that of the preceding year. 61 222 of the marriages were celebrated by the church, 28 at the Roman Catholic Chapel, Sardinia Street, 24 at Nonconformist places of worship, and 73 at the SuperintendentRegistrar's Office. In London the marriages registered in the year 1890 numbered 36,753 and were in the proportion of 8.3 marriages, or 16'6 persons married per 1,000 of the estimated population ; "This was a somewhat higher rate than in any of the three next preceding years, but otherwise the lowest rate recorded since civil registration began " (Registrar-General). In England and Wales during the same period the marriages of 445,376 persons were registered, giving an annual rate of 15.1 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Births and Birth-rate, During the year there were 1,183 births registered in the District; of these 591 were males and 592 were females, again showing an equal proportion of the two sexes. This number corresponds to an annual birth-rate of 26.0 per 1,000 for the whole of St. Giles District; the rate is almost identical with that of the preceding year, but 2.4 per 1,000 lower than that of the decennial average ,1880-89, and 3.1 per 1,000 lower than the rate recorded for London. The birth-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 29.4 per 1,000, a rate of 2.2 per 1,000 lower than that for the 10 years' average. The birth-rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, was as low as 20.3 per 1,000, being 1.9 per 1,000 less than the rate for 1889, and 1.6 per 1,000 below the decennial average. The excess of registered births in the District over deaths was 135. 62 The birth-rates, etc., for St. Giles District and the three registration sub-districts are set forth in the following table :— Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1881). Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Birthrate per 1,000. Average Birth-rate per 1,000 fur 10 years 1880—89. St. George, Bloomsbury 16,681 339 1 in 49.2 20.3 21.9 St. Giles, South 14,864 577 1 in 25.7 38.8 39.4 St. Giles, North 13,837 267 1 in 51.8 19.2 23.9 St. Giles District 45,382 1,183 1 in 38.3 26.0 28.4 Deaths and Death-rate. During the year the deaths registered in the three subdistricts were :— St. George, Bloomsbury . 202 St. Giles, South 431 St. Giles, North 204 Total 837 Of these 441 were males and 396 were females, showing an excessive mortality of 45 males over females. To obtain a true death-rate the number of registered deaths in the district must be corrected by adding the deaths of 258 parishioners, who died in the general hospitals, lunatic asylums and other public institutions situated outside the district; and by deducting the deaths of 60 nonparishioners, who died in the Workhouse, Broad Street, the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street, and the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. 63 The number of deaths by these alterations is increased to 1,035, corresponding to an annual death-rate for the whole district of 22.8 per 1,000 of the population ; this rate is 2.9 per 1,000 higher than the rate for 1889, but slightly lower than the rate for the decade 1880-89. It is also 2.5 per 1,000 higher than the rate for London. The death-rates for the two parishes were again unequal, for whilst the rate for Bloomsbury was as low as 14.9 per 1,000, the rate for St. Giles-in-the-Fields was as high as 27.3 per 1,000. There was again the same disproportion in the two subdistricts of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, the number of deaths in the southern division being 20.1 per 1,000 in excess of the northern. The heavy mortality in St. Giles, south, is again largely accounted for by the 270 deaths of old people at the Workhouse and the Cleveland Street Sick Asylum. The corrected death-rates, etc., for St. Giles District and the three registration sub-districts are set forth in the following table :— Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1881). Registered Deaths (corrected). Ratio of Deaths to Population. Death rate per 1,000 Average Death-rate perl,000for 10 years 1880—89. St. George, Bloomsbury 16,681 249 1 in 66.9 14.9 15.8 St. Giles, South 14,864 551 1 in 26.9 37.0 33.5 St. Giles, North 13,837 235 1 in 58.8 16.9 19.2 St. Giles District 45,382 1,035 1 in 43.8 22.8 23.0 64 Infantile Mortality. 299 children died before they reached five years of age; of these 190 were infants under one year ; this mortality is high, but it compares favourably with the numbers in preceding years. The deaths of children under one year were 16.0 per 1,000 of registered births, and 18.3 per 1,000 of total deaths. The deaths of children under five years equalled 28.8 per 1,000 of total deaths. The diseases, or groups of diseases, which were the chief causes of infantile mortality are herewith stated in their order of fatality, viz. : zymotic diseases, 71 ; diseases of the respiratory organs, 59; tubercular diseases, 45 ; debility and inanition, 29 ; premature birth, 27 ; convulsions, 23 ; and suffocation, i.e., accidentally overlaid in bed by their parents, 10. It is stated " that in Germany parents were liable to punishment if their children were found suffocated by being in bed with them, in consequence of which the infants were put to sleep in cots." Senile Mortality. There were 277 deaths of old people at sixty years of age and upwards ; 57 died from diseases of the brain and nervous system ; 34 from diseases of the heart and circulatory system; 98 from consumption and other diseases of the respiratory organs, and 35 were registered as deaths from old age. The deaths which occurred at advanced ages were :79 between 75 and 85 years. 6 „ 85 „ 90 „ 2 at 90 years. 2 at 91 „ 1 at 92 ,, 65 Uncertified Deaths. J he following three deaths were returned by the local registrars as uncertified, either by a qualified medical practitioner or by the Coroner. The particulars given in each case were as follows :— (1) A female, set. 53, died from weak heart; the medical attendant did not arrive until after death. (2) A female, set. 3, died from measles. No medical attendant. (3) A female, set. 52, died from syncope on her way to a public hospital. The Coroner was informed in each case, but did not consider an inquest necessary. In London, of the total deaths registered, the causes of 821, or 0.9 per cent., were not certified. In England and Wales the causes of 15,947, or 2'8 per cent. of the total deaths, were not certified ; this proportion, as in recent years, again showing a decline. Deaths in Public Institutions. (Within the District.) (A.) The Workhouse, Broad Street. The officers of the Guardians kindly informed me that the number of inmates in the Workhouse during the past year averaged 652, being 29 less than were provided for in the year 1889. There were 173 deaths in the Workhouse, and 97 at the Central Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street, a total of 270 pauper deaths, and equal to a death-rate of 41.4 per 1,000. The senile mortality is largely accountable for this heavy F 66 rate, tor no less than 127 of the deaths were those of persons at advanced age, viz. :— 70 deaths occurred between 60 and 70 years of age. 43 ,, „ „ 70 and 80 „ „ 11„ „ ,, 80 and 90 „ „ 3 ,, were above 90 years of age. 149 of the deaths were attributable to diseases of the respiratory organs. (B.) The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. During the year 166 women were delivered in the hospital of 170 children, 91 males and 79 females. Three died a few hours after their birth from debility and inanition. Three were still-born. There was only one maternal death (a non-parishioner) from exhaustion after a labour, which required operative assistance to effect delivery. The medical officers of the institution report the absence of any puerperal (lying-in) fever, and that the hospital remains in an eminently sanitary condition. In the out-patient department there were 631 deliveries, with 5 maternal deaths ; in the previous year 614, with no maternal death. The Medical Officer points out that 4 of the deaths were due to special and extraordinary conditions, and in no sense to defect in the working of the department. (C.) The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. This hospital and dispensary, which was established in 1867 at 10, Leicester Place, Leicester Square, to afford medical treatment, for all foreigners who speak French, was 67 removed during the past summer to the newly erected building in Shaftesbury Avenue. Since the opening of the new hospital 20 persons, admitted from various parts of the metropolis, died there. Of these 17 were adults and 3 children. Nearly all the deaths were from diseases of the brain, heart, and lungs. Deaths in Hospitals and Public Institutions. (Outside the District.) From the weekly returns sent to me from the RegistranGeneral's office, Somerset House, I find that during the past year 258 parishioners died outside the district in the following hospitals, lunatic asylums, and other public institutions, where they had been removed for treatment :— Public Institution. Number of Deaths. Public Institution. Number of Deaths. Brought forward 112 Middlesex Hospital 19 Cancer Hospital 2 King's College Hospital 34 Homoeopathic Hospital 2 Charing Cross Hospital 19 Western Fever Hospital 10 University College Hospital 8 Sick Asylum (Cleveland Street) 97 Royal Free Hospital 6 Fitzroy House Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 2 St. Anne's House Asylum 1 St. Bartho'omew's Hospital 3 London County Banstead Asylum 6 St. George's Hospital 1 Caterham Asylum 12 St. Thomas's Hospital 2 Hanwell Asylum 2 Westminster Hospital 1 Darenth Asylum 2 London Hospital 1 Colney Hatch Asylum 2 Central London Throat Hospital 1 St. Joseph's Home 1 Brompton Consumption Hospital 3 Mildmay House Mission 1 North London Consumption Hos. 1 St. George's Workhouse 1 City of London Consumption Hos. 1 St. Pancras Workhouse 1 Women's (Soho) Hospital 2 Westminster Workhouse 1 Children's (Great Ormond Street) Hospital St. Saviour's Workhouse 1 6 River Thames 1 Public Ways 2 3 French Hospital 1 German Hospital 1 Carried forward 112 Total 258 This number is 25 in excess of the hospital, &c., deaths in the preceding year ; the increase is accounted for by the f 2 68 inclusion in the London mortality this year for the first time of the deaths of London parishioners which occurred in certain lunatic and imbecile asylums situated outside the metropolitan area. Nineteen of the 258 deaths were from zymotic causes, viz.;— At Western Fever Hospital, Fulham (scarlet fever 7, enteric fever 1, measles 1). ., Children's Hospital, Gt. Ormond Street (diphtheria 2). ,, King's College Hospital (diphtheria 3, enteric fever 2). ,, Westminster Hospital (whooping-cough 1). ,, Guy's Hospital (diarrhoea 1). ., Cleveland Street Sick Asylum (whooping-cough l). Deaths in certain Classes of Diseases, 1. SPECIFIC FEBRTLE OR ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The seven principal diseases in this class are, small-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, fever (typhus, enteric, simple continued and relapsing), and diarrhoea. During 1890, in England and Wales, 59,698 deaths were attributed to these diseases, being 3,343 fewer than the number so referred in the previous year. The death-rate from these diseases was 2.03 per 1,000 living, the rates in the three preceding years having been 2.3, 1.8 and 2.1 per 1,000 respectively. In London, 12,402 deaths were registered from these diseases, equal to a zymotic death-rate of 2.7 per 1,000, against 2.2 and 2.5 per 1,000 for the two preceding years. 69 In St. Giles District these deaths numbered 85, and equalled a zymotic death-rate of 1.9 per 1,000 of the population, against 114 deaths and a death-rate of 2.5 per 1,000 for the previous year. 1. Small-pox (decennial average 5.4). There were only four deaths from small-pox in the whole of London in 1890, this being the fifth successive year in which the metropolis has been practically free from the disease. The annual report of the Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board states, " that 48 persons certified to be suffering from small-pox ; were removed from their homes in different parts of the metropolis to the manager's hospitals. In only 26 of these cases was the diagnosis confirmed by the medical superintendent of the hospitals to which they were conveyed ; of the 22 patients found not to •have small-pox, 18 were returned to their homes and 4, too ill to bear the return journey, were admitted into hospital." There has been no death from small-pox in this district since 1885. During the past year one slight case was reported, viz., that of a young woman, aged 19, residing at No. 9, Nottingham Court, who had contracted the disease whilst ' nursing her brother in the adjoining parish of St. Martin-inthe-Fields. It appears that in the first instance this woman attended as an out-patient at one of the general hospitals, where the medical staff, finding she was suffering from small-pox, did not detain and isolate her, but sent her home and telegraphed to the Asylum Board Authorities to remove her. No notification was sent to this office (the Local Sanitary Authority) about this case, the first and only information being 70 ceived from the Clerk of the Asylums Board that the patient had been admitted into their hospital. The usual steps were taken to disinfect the room, bedding etc., and fortunately the disease did not spread. 2. Measles (decennial average 30.3). The 17 deaths of children from this disease were considerably below the average and the number (41) recorded in the preceding year; on the other hand, the 3,291 deaths from it in all London were largely in excess of the average. 3. Scarlet-fever (decennial average 14.6). 128 cases of scarlet fever were notified under the Act. The deaths were 8, against 20, 4, and 4 in the three preceding years respectively. The Registrar-General states,"for seven consecutive years the mortality from scarlet-fever has been largely below the previous average, and though it would be rash to assert that this reduction is certainly due to the increased facilities afforded by the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, it is at any rate a noteworthy fact that the reduction has occurred simultaneously with a constantly increasing use of those hospitals for cases of this disease." A large percentage of the patients attacked in this district were removed and treated at the Western Fever Hospital, Fulham. The annual reports of the Chairman and the Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, show that the total number of scarlet-fever patients removed from the several London districts amounted to 6,538, of whom 510 died, a mortality of 7.8 per cent. 4. Whooping-Cough (decennial average 27.l). The 17 deaths of children under 5 years of age were 10 below the 71 10 years' average. The disease was most severe and fatal during the cold weather at the beginning of the year. 5. Diphtheria (decennial average 14.2). The 10 deaths from this disease in St. Giles District were 4 below the average. In London, diphtheria has been very prevalent during the past three years, and in 1890 the deaths from it were considerably in excess of the average. The Chairman of the Metropolitan Asylums Board reports, "There were 1,073 diphtheria patients in the several fever hospitals of the managers during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1890, and that the mortality was 33 17 per cent." Dr. Thorne Thorne, the Medical Inspector for the general sanitary purposes at the Local Government Board, reports, " It was shown by reference to statistics that during the last decennium there had been a substantial increase of diphtheria mortality in this country, and that a very significant portion of this increase had taken place in the metropolis." The Registrar-General, in his annual summary of births, deaths and causes of death in London, l890, states "that in 1890 the deaths from diphtheria in London numbered 1,417, giving a rate of 0.32 per 1,000 living. The rate in the next preceding year had been 0.37, but with this one exception the rate in 1890 was the highest yet recorded in London. There is an increasing tendency to make use of the metropolitan hospitals in cases of diphtheria, for while in 1889, 17.3 per cent. of the deaths from this disease occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums or London Fever Hospitals, the proportion rose in 1890 to 227 per cent." Some part of the increase under diphtheria may be due 72 to a diminution under the heading "croup," which is separated from diphtheria and classified with respiratory diseases. As a proof how terribly fatal diphtheria is amongst young children, the Salford Hospital report states that of a total of 118 cases admitted the percentage mortality was 31.4. In the twelfth annual report of the sanitary condition of the Borough and Port of Ipswich the following question is asked as to the prevalence of diphtheria :—" Is the disease lurking in our sewers, and have the emanations from the sewer gratings anything to do with its wide prevalence? There is no doubt that young children are often seen playing near the sewer ventilators in the roads, and stooping over the street-gulleys looking for lost balls and tops, in which position they are very liable to receive whiffs of sewer gas." At the International Medical Congress held at Berlin in August last, the subject of the measures to be taken in averting the spread of diphtheria was discussed in the section of hygiene. The cause of diphtheria is held to be a bacillus, which, contained in the exudation on the affected mucous membranes, is liable to be disseminated in the vicinity of the patient, together with particles of the false membrane. The infectivity of the patient may even persist for a few days after all traces of diphtheritic exudation have disappeared. The strictest isolation of cases is necessary, and children who have suffered from the disease should be kept from school for at least four weeks. The bacilli have been found to retain their vitality in dry membranes for from four to five months. It is therefore essential that all clothing, bed-linen and utensils likely to have been contaminated, should be disinfected, either by boiling or by exposure to steam. The room occupied by the patient should be disinfected by washing the floors with warm sublimate 73 solution (1 in 1,000), and cleansing the walls and furniture with bread. Diphtheria seems to be favoured by the dampness of dwellings, and also by the absence of light. The organisms develop well in milk, the sale of this commodity should therefore be carefully supervised. The diseases which resemble diphtheria, affecting pigeons, fowls, calves and pigs, are not to be feared as sources of the human affection. (Professor Loftier, of Greisswald.) 6. Fever (includes enteric or typhoid, typhus, simple continued, relapsing and ill-defined forms of Fever), (decennial average 11.2). 30 cases of fever were notified during the year ; of these 10 were fatal, all adults. The District was again free from typhus. The Asylums Board received into their fever hospitals from the several parishes in the Metropolis, 588 enteric fever patients, of whom 93 died, showing a mortality of 20.1 per cent., and 24 typhus fever patients, of whom 5 died, or 26.5 per cent. The deaths in London ascribed to these several forms of fever were far below the average 7. Diarrhcea (decennial average 31.1). The 22 deaths, 5 adults and 17 children, were below the average ; this low fatality was largely due to the cold and wet which prevailed during the summer months, the temperature in June, July and August having been considerably below the average. At the end of August a parishioner, set. 55, died from an attack of English cholera (cholera nostras) after an illness of 18 hours; the symptoms closely resembled those of Asiatic cholera, viz., vomiting, purging, with rice water evacuations, cramp, blueness and coldness of the extremities. 1 was informed that the illness was probably caused or 74 aggravated by the deceased having eaten too heartily of tinned fish at a river excursion two days previously. Tbe following table shows the total admissions and deaths of small-pox, fever and diphtheria patients during the year 1890, from the several metropolitan parishes and unions, into the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board:— Parishes and Unions.

Influenza.—.At the end of December, 1889, the Metropolis was visited by an outbreak of Influenza, a disease of a catarrhal type, accompanied with cerebral, pulmonary and intestinal complications. During January, I 890, the epidemic was at its height, but was practically over by the end of the following month; the symptoms of the disease were about the same as in previous epidemics, viz., suddenness of the attack, high fever accompanied with catarrhal headache, intense nervous depression and physical prostration. According to the weekly returns of the Registrar-General, nearly 600 fatal cases occurred in London. In St. Giles district there were 10 deaths, 9 adults and 1 child under 5 years of age. The deaths for all London were comparatively few compared with the numbers attacked, and those who died from it were probably enfeebled by chronic diseases of the lungs and other organs. Domestic animals, especially horses, in various parts of the Metropolis suffered severely from this disease, but the job-masters and other horse-keepers residing in this district informed me that their stables had been free from illness. The Local Government Board issued a circular letter to the Medical Officers of Health throughout the country as to the origin and mode of distribution of Influenza in Great Britain. The questions in the circular, with my answers annexed, were as follows :— (1) Has any "influenza," particularly if characterized by much nervous depression, severe frontal headache, or nervous muscular pains, shown itself in your district?—Yes. 76 (2) The date of the first occurrence (as far as you know) of such an influenza 1—About the last week in December, 1889. (3) The date of commencement of any extensive prevalence of such influenza?—1st January, 1890. (4) Any opinion you have formed (or that you wish to modify) as to the mode of origin of introduction of the disease, and as to its method of spread 1 —Atmospheric influences. (5) Have you observed among domestic animals any unusual complaints, and in what animals, and with what symptoms?—No. (6) Illustrations or observations as to the behaviour of any observed influenza, especially as to the intervals of attack in members of households, its dissemination among particular communities, and its incidence on particular localities 1—The disease attacked rich and poor about the same time in all parts of the district. Only one death occurred below the age of puberty. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs were very heavy. Dr. Clemow, who was practising as a physician in Cronstadt, Petersburgh, has given the following interesting account of the spread of the disease. It was first noted at Tomsk in Central Siberia, where it was prevalent in October, 1889; it then spread eastwards towards Petersburg!); it traversed Poland and prevailed in Vienna at the end of November, and then in Paris. About the second week in December it was found prevalent in Stockholm, Dantzic, Berlin, Hamburg, and its general prevalence in London being noted at Christmas. Influenza is reported to have prevailed during some season of the following years: In the twelfth century, 1173 ; thirteenth century, 12o9, 1299; fourteenth century, 1311, 1323, 1326 ; fifteenth century, 1403, 1410, 1411, 1414; sixteenth century, 1510, 1557, 1558, 1562, 1574, 1580, 1591, 1593; seventeenth century, 1610, 1626, 1627, 1642, 1643, 1647, 1655, 1658, 1669, 1675, 1688, 1693 ; eighteenthcentury, 1708, 1709, 1712, 1729, 1730, 1733, 1737, 1738, 1742, 1743, 1757, 1758, 1761, 1762, 1767, 1772, 1775, 1778, 1780, 1781, 1782,1788, 1790, 1795, 1797, 1798; nineteenth 77 tury, 1803, 1805, 1827, 1830, 1831, 1832,1833, 1837, 1839, 1843, 1847, 1848, 1850, 1851, 1857, 1858, I860, 1864, 1867, 1872, 1874, 1879, and the present epidemic makes the eightieth epidemic since 1173. Influenza is also said to have prevailed as early as 827, 876 and 976. II. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. The principal tubercular diseases in this class oi diseases caused 167 deaths, equal to 164 deaths per 1,000 of total deaths at all ages. Phthisis (consumption of the lungs) was fatal to 142 persons; the other forms of scrofulous disease destroyed 25 lives, chiefly children. III. DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. These diseases caused 270 deaths, equivalent to a deathrate of 5 "9 per 1,000 living. Bronchitis and pneumonia were responsible for 262 deaths. The Registrar-General states "that in 1890 the increased mortality from diseases of the respiratory system was most remarkable; in 1889 there had been a saving under this heading of 4,376 lives, when the year's mortality was compared with the average of the previous decennium; but in 1 890 this saving was transformed into a loss of 2,143 lives." IV. VIOLENT DEATHS. Inquests. There were 92 cases of sudden and violent deaths which required investigation before the Coroner. The various causes of death returned by the Jurors are classified as follows ; — 78 Causes of Death. St. George, Bloomsbury. St. Giles-inthe Fields. Whole District. From natural causes.

The Public Mortuary, Goldsmith Street. During the past year 80 bodies were received in the Mortuary, 67 by the Coroner's order, 5 were brought in by 79 the police, and 8 by the friends of the deceased. Postmortem examinations were made in 42 cases; 3 of the bodies of persons who had died from infectious diseases were placed in the proper chamber set apart for the purpose. Since the opening of the Mortuary in 1883, 637 bodies have been received, 330 post-mortem examinations made, and 511 inquests held in the Coroner's Court attached to the building. The Mortuary is at times utilized for the reception of other than human remains, for a year ago the carcase of a large dog was sent in a packing case, and last October the police brought in the fore and hind quarters of a bear which was found exposed in the public way. The following tables (A.) of deaths, classified according to diseases, ages, and localities, and (B.) of population, births, and of new cases of infectious sickness, are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board. 80 (A.)—Table of Deaths during the Year 1890, in the Metropolitan Sanitary District op St. Giles, Classified according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.

I.—Buildings belonging to the Peabody Donation Fund. The Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund in their Twenty-sixth Annual Report for the year 1890, state that the net gain of the year from rents and interest was £28,656 2s. 2d. Up to the end of the year they have provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London, 1 1,275 rooms, besides bath-rooms, laundries and wash-houses occupied by 20,462 persons; these rooms comprise 5,071 separate dwellings, viz., 75 of 4 rooms, 1,789 of 3 rooms, 2,401 of 2 rooms and 806 of 1 room. The birth-rate for the year was 38"4 per 1,000, being 9"4 per 1,000 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate, including the deaths of inhabitants removed to hospitals, was 21*1 per 1,000, which is 0'8 per 1,000 above the average of London. The infant mortality was 141 "2 in each 1,000 births, or 21.3 below that of London. Under the provisions of the 26th Section of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890 (53 Vict., ch. 8), I was called upon to certify that the Peabody Buildings in Great Wild and Little Coram Streets were so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting them, and that due provision was made for their sanitary requirements. Accordingly, I visited every room and examined the w.c.'s, flushing-boxes and waste-water preventers, sinks and drawoff taps, wash-houses, dust shoots and dust receptacles, and bath-rooms throughout the two blocks of buildings.
