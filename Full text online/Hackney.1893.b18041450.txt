MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT For the Year 1893. SANITARY DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Members of the Hackney Vestry. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Report on the Health of Hackney for the year 1893. In doing so, I have to state with regret that the general death-rate for that period was higher than it has been for some years. But although high for the district of Hackney, it was nevertheless lower than the general death-rate for all London. The infantile and zymotic death rates were also excessive,—the latter exceeding the all London rate. This increase in the number of deaths during 1893 was due, as I have pointed out later in the report, to the abnormal incidence of the infectious fevers during the year. In consequence of this an enormous amount of extra labour was thrown upon the Sanitary Department, and its resources put to a severe test. The inspection of dwellings in which fever cases occurred, of which over 4000 were reported, led to the discovery and abatement of a very large number of nuisances. The notification of infectious diseases has 4 therefore been of great assistance, not only in the prevention of the spread of disease, but in the detection of conditions " dangerous or injurious to health." The necessity for an increase in the staff of Sanitary Inspectors, pointed out by me in my last year's report, still exists. The very important duty of the inspection of workshops could not be attempted during 1893, and house-to-house inspection had to be suspended during the greater part of the year. But in spite of these numerous disadvantages, the work, taken as a whole, performed by the Department during the year, has been of a most satisfactory character. Supported and encouraged by the Hackney Vestry, the work of the Sanitary Department must continue to improve in character, and lead to increased health and prosperity to the inhabitants of the Parish of Hackney. VITAL STATISTICS. Estimated Population.—The population of the District of Hackney at the middle of the year 1893, I estimate to be 239,226. This shews an estimated increase of 5,813 persons during the year. The natural increase, i.e., the increase of births over deaths was 2,667. This estimate is of course only approximate. To obtain the true population it would be necessary to balance the births against the deaths, and also to take into account the numbers gained and lost to the District by new comers and those leaving the District; but these latter figures it is not possible to obtain. Supposing the above estimate of population to be exact, the density of population will be 60.76 per acre. It must be expected that this density will increase year by year, as there is ample room for a greatly increased population. I give below a table showing the above facts in the various registration sub-districts. 5 Table showing population, area and density of Registration Sub-Districts in Hackney. Stoke Newington. Stamford Hill. West Hackney Hackney South Hackney Totals Estimated Population 32,757 19,667 43,725 100,896 42,181 239,226 Area in square acres 638 613 467 1,749 470 3,937 Density=persons per acre 51.34 32.08 93.62 57.68 89.74 60.76 Births.—During the year 1893, there were 6,900 births registered in the District of Hackney. Of these 3,417 were males and 3,483 were females. This is equal to a birth-rate of 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants. Compared with 1892, there has been a total increase of 142 births. Below is given a table showing number of births and rates per 1,000 in each Sub-District. BIRTHS. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-Districts. All London.

This is equal to a rate of 14.8 per 1,000 against 17.2 per 1,000 for all London. The Hackney rate for the year 1892 was 15.7. DEATHS. General Death-rate.—During the fifty-two weeks of the year 1893, 4,233 deaths were registered in the District of Hackney. Of these, 2,108 were males and 2,125 were females. But these figures do not 6 represent the true death-roll of Hackney, for a certain number of Hackney residents dying in outside institutions is not included. After making this necessary correction, I arrive at death rate of 19.0 per 1,000 against 17.2 per 1,000 for the year 1892. The death-rate for the whole of London for 1893 was 21.3 per 1,000. The increase in the death-rate was due to the great prevalence of the specific febrile diseases in Hackney during the year. Infant Mortality.— The deaths of children under one year numbered 1,045, an increase of 133 over the preceding year. Calculated as a rate per 1,000 of births, this is equal to 151.4 per 1,000. The rate for 1892 was 134.9, and that for all London 164 per 1,000. The infant mortality taken for a series of years is considered a fair index to the sanitary condition of a district. The high rate obtaining for 1893 was due to the excessively hot and dry summer, which carried off by summer diarrhoea a large number of infants, and to the prevalence of the infectious fevers, the victims to which are mostly young children. Below is given a table of the principal causes of deaths of infants, with the deaths distributed in the four quarters of the year. Eleven principal causes of Infant Mortality. First Quarter.

Class I. Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases.—Amongst this class 838 deaths were recorded during the year. This is equal to a rate of 3.5 per 1,000, that for London during the same period being 2.86 per 1,000. The above rate for Hackney is an increase upon that for 1892, which was 31 per 1,000. Included in this class are the following infectious diseases:— NOTIFIABLE DISEASES. Small Pox.—The number of cases of this disease notified during the year was an increase upon those notified during the year 1892, namely 62, of which 4 died. Of these four, three had never been vaccinated, and the vaccination of the other case was doubtful. Scarlatina.— Hackney again suffered severely from this disease during 1893. Altogether during the year 2,475 cases were notified. This is an increase of 531 on the previous year. Towards the autumn the same want of hospital accommodation was experienced on the part of the Metropolitan Asylums Board as in the year 1892. In consequence many cases had to be nursed at home under conditions which could not fail to assist in the spread of the disease. The number of deaths from this disease was 47. This is equal to a rate of 0.3 per 1,000 living persons in the district. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.— I have taken these two diseases together, because I consider them the same, although differing in name. This disease was very prevalent during 1893. The total number of cases notified was 946. This is an increase of 11 336 on the previous year. With respect to the cause of so much diphtheria, there is a growing feeling amongst sanitarians that it is in some way caused by defective sanitary conditions. In a very large number of cases we do find the disease associated with defective sanitary surroundings, much more so than in scarlatina. But the number of observations made by me in Hackney has not been sufficient yet to make any definite statement on this point. The deaths from diphtheria numbered 190, which equals a death-rate of 0.79 per 1,000. This is an extremely high rate, but is slightly lower than in 1892. Enteric or Typhoid Fever.—Three hundred and fifty cases of this disease were notified during the year. This is an increase of 173 over those in 1892. The deaths numbered 53, which is equal to a deathrate of 0.22 per 1,000. Continued Fever.—By this name seven cases of fever were notified during the year, and all the patients recovered. Erysipelas.—Of this disease 478 cases were notified during the year. Of these, 24 proved fatal. This is equal to a mortality of 0.10 per 1,000 inhabitants of the district. Amongst the institutions of Hackney, the Infirmary furnished 19 cases of erysipelas. Puerperal Fever.—Seventeen cases of this disease were notified during 1893, two only of which proved fatal. Cholera.— Three cases of this disease were notified, but on investigation they were proved to be cases of English cholera or summer diarrhœa.

Influenza.—During the year 86 deaths were registered from this disease. This is a decline in numbers upon the previous year. The mortality per 1,000 is 0.35. Below is given a table showing the number of deaths in each month during the last three years. Deaths from Influenza in each month during the years 1891, 1892, 1893. Year. Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May.

This is equal to a mortality of 060 per 1,000, against 0.80 per 1,000 for all London. This is a greatly increased rate upon that of 1892, and is to be accounted for by the excessive heat and dryness of the summer of 1893. The majority of the deaths, as usual, occurred during the third quarter of the year. This is shown in the following table. Deaths from Diarrhœa— 1892. 1893. First Quarter 8 5 Second Quarter 12 29 Third Quarter 88 102 Fourth Quarter 5 9 Of the 145 deaths, 108 occurred amongst children under one year, and 128 amongst those under five years old. Measles.—This disease was not so fatal during 1893 as in 1892. Fifty-six deaths were registered, the rate being 0.23 per 1,000 inhabitants. 16 Whooping Cough.—The deaths from this disease numbered 155, showing a great increase upon the previous year. The mortality rate per 1,000 is 0.64. Class II. Constitutional Diseases.—This class of diseases furnished 776 deaths during 1893. Of these, 428 were due to tubercular diseases and 160 to cancer. The mortality for these two diseases respectively is 1.7 and 0 6 per 1,000, and for the whole class 3.2 per 1,000. Class III. Developmental Diseases.—The deaths in this class numbered 377. The mortality rate is therefore 1.5 per 1,000. Class IV. Local Diseases--The accompanying table will show what diseases are included in this class. The deaths numbered 2,148, of which 926 were due to diseases of respiratory organs. The total gives a mortality rate of 8.9 per 1,000. Class V. Violent Deaths.—Under this head 132 deaths were recorded. This is equal to a rate of 0.5 per 1,000. Class VI. Ill-defined, and not specified causes.—The number of deaths under this head has a tendency to grow less every year, because of the increasing accuracy in diagnosis and the more frequent post-mortem examinations. The number during the year was 280, making the rate 1.2 per 1,000. 17 TABLE OF DEATHS of Inhabitants of the Hackney District between 1st.

Below is given a table compiled from returns furnished by the Vaccination Officers, showing the number of births, number of infants vaccinated successfully and unsuccessfully ; also the number not vaccinated at all. One remarkable feature about these figures is the extraordinary number of infants unvaccinated. Practically more than half the infants born escape vaccination. If this proportion escapes vaccination every year, and small-pox ever gains a foothold in Hackney the consequences will no doubt be serious.

During the summer of 1898, Asiatic cholera again appeared on the continent of Europe, attacking with great intensity certain of its towns where the conditions where favourable for its spread. Toward the autumn it showed itself in certain towns on the eastern coast of Great Britain. Several sporadic cases also occurred in London causing great anxiety in the Metropolis. About this time I received a communication from the Medical Officer to the London County Council, stating that the Council had authorised him to send to Dr. Klein for bacteriological examination, the dejecta of any notified cases of cholera, and asking me to inform him of any suspected cases occurring in the district of Hackney. During the summer and autumn three cases were notified as Cholera in Hackney, but on investigation all of these were proved to be examples of Summer or Choleraic Diarrhoea. But in one instance the symptoms were so suggestive, both to the medical attendant and myself, of Asiatic Cholera, as to induce me to cause the removal of the patient to hospital and to furnish Dr. Klein with one of the rice-waterlike evacuations for examination. The following are the full particulars of the case, extracted from the medical officer's report to the London County Council:— T. S. (male), age 26, builder, Ottaway Road, Hackney. On September the 16th he ate a bloater for breakfast, and he subsequently ate some whelks. On September the 17th he ate pickled pork, which his wife and children shared, both remaining well. At 1 a.m. on the 18th, vomiting and diarrhoea with cramps in the limbs set in. The stools looked like rice-water. On the afternoon of the same day he was admitted into St. Bartholomew's hospital in a state of collapse. The diarrhoea had then ceased, and from this time his condition improved and he made a good recovery. One of the rice water-like evacuations was obtained on September 18th by Dr. Warry, acting Medical Officer of Health of Hackney, and submitted to Dr. Klein on the 22nd. Report by Dr. Klein:— Numerous whitish-grey flakes were present, which under the microscope did not show the epithelial character. There were present crowds of straight bacilli. Cultivations proved entirely negative qua commas. As in 1892 the Sanitary Committee, recognizing the gravity of the situation, authorized me to make the necessary preparations in view of a possible introduction of this dire disease into Hackney, and presented the following report thereon to the Hackney District Board of Works :— 24 LETTER FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD re CHOLERA. Your Committee have to report that they held a meeting on the 1st instant to consider your reference on letter from the Local Government Board. as to the organisation of measures of precaution against the possible introduction of cholera into London. Every precaution has been taken in the District in order to be prepared in the event of an outbreak of cholera. As regards hospital accommodation, although the first cases of cholera will be treated at the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, the following Institutions have promised to provide accommodation for patients :— Kingsland Road 24 Beds German Hospital, Dalston 25 „ Hackney Union Workhouse 12 „ Six Ambulance Stations have been fixed in various parts of the District, viz.:—The Workhouse, Sidney Road; Eastern Hospital, Homerton; Old Town Hall, Mare Street; German Hospital. Dalston; Police Station, Stoke Newington ; Metropolitan Hospital, Kingsland Road. For the purpose of medical visitation of cholera and choleraic diarrhoea patients, the District has been divided into nine Sub-Districts with a Medical Practitioner to each. These gentlemen have signified their willingness to be appointed for this purpose at a fee of £1 1s. 0d. per diem, and your Committee recommend that these appointments be made should it be found necessary to engage their services. Your Committee being of opinion that a house should be provided in each Sub-District for the reception of inmates whose premises are undergoing disinfection and cleansing, have instructed the acting Medical Officer of Health to make inquiries as to vacant houses in the District for this purpose, and your Committee recommend that this course be adopted. Communications have been made with the various nursing establishments with the view of obtaining a sufficient number of nurses should occasion require. Your Committee recommend that a copy of this report be forwarded to the Local Government Board. H. TIDDEMAN, Chairman. T. NICHOLLS J. SPENCER W. TAYLOR A. ROYLE E. A. GIBSON H. HULLAND B. A. FORROW J. GINN J. SHEEHAN 13th Sept., 1893. It is a source of gratification that we wore not called upon to make use of any of the preparations. 25 HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR FEVER PATIENTS. In consequence of the enormous amount of fever prevalent in London during the summer of 1893, the hospital accommodation at the disposal of the Managers of the Asylums Board was found to be quite inadequate for the wants of the Metropolis. Besides this want of accommodation there was in Hackney a great lack of discrimination as to the cases received into the Board's Hospitals. That is to say, the preference was not always given to cases occurring in over-crowded or densely populated districts or to those mostly in need of medical attendance. Preference ought, in my opinion, where the hospital accommodation is limited, to be given to such cases as these ; if this were done the spread of infectious disease would, I am certain, be much lessened. The Board's officials labour under one disadvantage, that they cannot know the social conditions and surroundings of patients at the time application is made for their removal; but after notification, their surroundings are enquired into, and the possibility or otherwise of isolation and attendance at home, ascertained by the Medical Officer of Health of the district. I think therefore the Managers of the Asylums Board, in the interest of the Public Health, should give precedence to such cases as the Medical Officer of Health of the district considers most urgent. On this subject letters were received from the Managers of the Asylums Board and the Marylebone Vestry, which formed the subject of the following report, presented to the Hackney Board of Works. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR FEVER PATIENTS. Your Committee have to report the receipt of letters from the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, dated 18th and 21st ultimo, on the subject of hospital accommodation for fever patients, stating that as the accommodation at the Managers' disposal will shortly become exhausted, and in consequence of the difficulty experienced in providing suitable sites for hospitals, they have thought it desirable to give this Board notice of the probability of their being called upon to make provision for their own infectious sick. They further express the hope that instructions may be issued to the officers concerned for preference being given to the removal to the Asylums Board's Hospitals of those patients who, as a consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life are most in need of hospital treatment. 26 Also letter from Vestry of St. Marylebone on the same subject, stating that as they consider it unfair and undesirable that an individual parish should be called upon to supplement the hospital provision for infectious cases locally and at their sole expense, they have arranged for a conference to be held at the Court House, Marylebone Lane, W., on the 28th inst. at 3 o'clock p.m., and invite this Board to appoint two Members, together with the Medical Officer of Health, as delegates to attend the proposed conference. Your Committee have to report that the medical practitioners of the district have been advised by the Acting Medical Officer of Health as to the necessity for discrimination in the removal of patients to hospital, and now recommend :— (1) That the Metropolitan Asylums Board be requested to provide the necessary hospital accommodation forthwith. (2) That every facility be offered by this Board to the Managers for carrying this into effect. (3) That the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, Mr. Hulland, and the Acting Medical Officer of Health be appointed as a deputation to represent this Board at the proposed conference on the 28th inst. All of which your Committee respectfully submit. H. T. TIDDEMAN, Chairman. T. R. PITT. H. HULLAND. A. ROYLE. R. FEESEY. H. McLACHLAN B. A. FORROW. J. GINN. The proposed conference was held at the Court House, St. Marylebone, on the 28th, when the following resolutions were passed :— 1 That in view of the urgent necessity of further provision being made for the rapidly increasing number of persons suffering from Infectious Diseases, and the declared inability of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide the necessary accommodation, this Conference do appoint a deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board for the purpose of urging them to facilitate the acquisition of sites by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or the provision of suitable Buildings. 2 That the Deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board do consist of three members of each Sanitary Authority of the Metropolis. 3 That copies of the Resolutions be sent to the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis, 27 I believe the Local Government Board were approached on this subject, but with how much success is not apparent. RIVER LEA. During the summer of 1893, in consequence of the dryness of the season, the level of the water of the Lea was considerably lowered, and the pollutions to which it no doubt is subject became more manifest to persons in the neighbourhood. In consequence, I presented the following reports thereon to the Hackney Board of Works :— ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES TAKEN FROM RIVER LEA, &c. Complaints having been made that the Lea water was offensive in smell, I made an inspection of the river, with the object, if possible, of finding the source of pollution. I found that at a point in the river opposite the White House, Temple Mills, the effluents from the Leyton and Walthamstow sewage farms were poured into the river. I give below analyses of samples of these effluents, and also an analysis of the Lea water taken farther down the river. The analyses show the river water to be very much polluted: and the samples of effluents show them to be not much better than raw sewage. This will become a more serious nuisance during the hot I suggest, therefore, that the above facts be communicated to the Lea Conservancy Board, and that it be requested to take the necessary steps to prevent the Lea water being so polluted; and, in default, the London County Council be asked to take action.

In reply, the following letter with enclosure was received from the Lea Conservancy Board:- LEfe Conservancy Office, 12, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C., 11th November, 1893. Dear Sir,—In answer to your letter of the 10th ultimo, and copy of Dr. King Warry's report on the effluents from the Sewage Works of Walthamstow and Leyton, I am directed to send, for the information of the Hackney Board of Works, a copy of the report of Major L. Flower, the Sanitary Engineer of the Conservancy, on the matter. 29 A copy of this report has also been sent to the Local Government Board, in answer to a letter received from them. I am, yours faithfully, Geo. Grocott, Esq., GEO. CORBLE, Clerk. Hackney Board of Works, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. Extract from report of Major Flower, Sanitary Engineer to the Lea Conservancy Board, dated 3rd November, 1893:— HACKNEY BOARD OF WORKS. Complaint as to Walthamstow and Leyton; Also similar complaints forwarded by the Local Government Board. These letters will be laid before you. The samples taken and analysed by Dr. King-Warry, are dated 27th August, 1893. I have visited both places since that date, and fail to find any reasonable cause of complaint. It is quite possible that there may have been pollution on the dates set forth. Complaint should have been made at the time. I repeat there will be occasional pollution from these large districts until there be a main intercepting sewer constructed to take away their sewage; and inasmuch as the London County Council has taken over the Hackney Marshes, I recommend this matter to their serious consideration. Tottenham might also be connected therewith, and the sewage thereof carried away by gravitation, and pumping be saved. In the above letter there is an admission that the River Lea will occasionally be polluted by the effluents from the Leyton and Walthamstow sewage farms. There is also a suggestion from the engineer to the Lea Conservancy Board that a main intercepting sewer should be constructed to carry away the sewage from these districts. Such a remedy would go a long way towards purifying the river Lea as it passes through Hackney; but, in addition to the pollutions from the above-named districts, the Lea receives many pollutions from its source downwards. 30 Before the Ttoyal Commission on the London water supplies, the following evidence was given on this point by Dr. Turner, who had been specially employed by the London County Council to inspect the Biver Lea and its tributaries above the intake of the East London Water Company, with a view of ascertaining the contamination that river is exposed to. , An inspection of the rivers, made for the purposes of this report, showed that about 95,000 persons living in towns and villages discharge sewage effluents after more or less purification into the river. The effluents from 85,000 of these may be regarded as efficiently purified; a pretence of purification is made in regard to the sewage of the three villages, with an aggregate population of 5,500, while five others with a total of 7,000 inhabitants run unpurified sewage into the streams. There remain about 50,000 people living within the area, in villages or scattered farms and cottages, who would not generally be considered to pollute the river, their places of residence being too far from the banks. But the possibility of at least occasional pollution from farms and houses at a very considerable distance is much greater than I supposed until I had paid particular attention to the question, and then it became evident that during rainy weather the drainage from many of the cottages, etc., could be traced of course greatly diluted, through ditches until it reached the river. I have observed and taken note of pollution from 397 houses, 24 mills, 21 farms, 6 public-houses, 2 soliools, and 5 slaughter-houses or places where pigs are occasionally slaughtered. The inhabitants of these houses, mills, farms, etc., cannot amount to less than 2,000 persons. In addition, at various places, such as Stansted, Standon, Braugliing, Aspeden, Widford, Hormead, etc., sewage evidently enters the river through ditches and rain-water drains, but as the premises are not directly connected with these drains it is impossible to state how many persons actually contribute to the pollution, but probably at least as many more, i.e. 2,000 do so. In round numbers, sewage, sewage effluent, or slop water, from 100,000 persons reaches the Lea and its tributaries above the intake of the water companies. The only manufacturing process which requires consideration as fouling the river is that of malting. And I find that, leaving out of consideration those maltings which drain into sewers discharging on to sewage farms, etc., no less than 8,896,250 gallons of malting water are turned into the streams. In addition to the above-described impurities, the river is fouled at various places from the Water Company's intake down to the point 31 where it enters the district of Hackney, and in Hackney, as mentioned before, the effluents from two sewage farms are poured into it. The water cannot therefore be considered to be in a very desirable state of purity. I wish to draw the attention of the Hackney Vestry to these facts, because it is, I believe, a part of the scheme for the conversion of the Hackney Marsh into a public open space, initiated by the London County Council, to divert the Lea water on to certain parts of the Marsh in order to form artificial pools. Unless some steps are taken to render the Lea water freer from pollution this act will be fraught with danger. It is obvious, that if some of the Lea branches, where the water is somewhat shallow (although the flow is fairly good), become offensive in hot weather, the proposed lake, where the flow will bo reduced to a minimum, will also become offensive. Such a prospect is anything but encouraging to those interested in the future open space called the Hackney Marsh. In the Preamble to the Act of Parliament which constituted the present Lea Conservancy Board the following occurs:— Whereas a large proportion ot the water supplied to the Metropolis is drawn from the lliver Lee, and the Lee is extensively used for the purposes of navigation, and for these and other reasons the preservation of the purity of the water of the Lee and its tributaries, and the improvement of the stream bed and banks thereof, and the maintenance and improvements of the cuts, locks and other navigation works on the Lee are objects of great public and local importance. From this it is evident that one of the primary duties of the Conservators is to prevent pollution of the River Lea. I would suggest that in the interest of the Public Health, the Hackney Vestry should request the Conservators to do their duty in this respect; and if they are unwilling or unable to do that duty, the Vestry should urge in the proper quarter the desirability of a reconstitution of the Board of Conservators, with a view of securing thereon a larger representation from the Hackney Parish to advance its health interests. 32 DISINFECTING APPARATUS, In my last year's Report I stated that the Hackney Board of Works had ordered a steam disinfecting apparatus, and the erection of a more appropriate station. The station and apparatus have been erected and have been in use for some months. The latter is of the Washington-Lyons type with vacuum apparatus. Such an apparatus was very much needed in the Hackney District, and I can only say that I look forward with much more confidence to disinfection performed by its means, than by the dry heat apparatus lately in use. CUSTOMS AMD INLAND REVENUE ACT (1890). Under the provisions of this Act, applications were made to me by eight owners to inspect 184 tenements, with a view to obtaining certificates, that the tenements were in a good sanitary condition,, and provided sufficient accomodation for their inmates. I was able to grant certificates for 126, but the remaining 56 were not in such a condition as to justify my granting certificates. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT (LONDON), 1891. Under Sections 16, 39, 50, 94, of this Act, the Local Sanitary Authority is required to make bye-laws for the following matters: 1. The Prevention of Nuisances. 2. Water Closets supplied with water. 8. Cleansing of Cisterns, &c. 4. Houses let in Lodgings. During the year 1893, Bye-Laws for 1, 2, 3 were drafted and received the approval of the Hackney Sanitary Authority and the Local Government Board, and are now in force in the District. Copies of these Bye-Laws are appended to the Report. Bye-Laws still remain to be made by the Hackney Sanitary Authority for "Houses let in Lodgings." THE MORTUARY.

The cost of removing and disposing of the house refuse for the whole district of Hackney during the year 1893 was £3,032 5s. 4d. for the "A" division; £3,319 0s. 9d. for the "B" division; £2,769 7s. 6d. for the "C" division—the total for the three divisions being £9,120 13s. 7d. From the "A" division, 17,536 loads (54 cubic feet each) at 8/6½ per load were removed; from the "B" division 15,619 loads at 4/3 per load; and from the "C" division, 14,772 loads at 8/9 pei load—the total number of loads being 47,927, at an average cost of 3/9½ per load. But in addition to the above sum paid to the Contractors, the Board of Works expended £1,625 13s. 6d. in wages to their dustman, thus bringing up the total cost for the year to £10,746 7s. 1d. For the year 1892, 48,012 loads of refuse were removed at an average cost per load of 3/8, and a total cost, including the dustmen's wages, of £10,071 19s. 7d. So that during the past year, although the number of loads removed was less by 85 than in 1892, the total cost has increased by £674 7s. 6d. The experience of 1893 of increased cost of removal is only a repetition of many previous years. Contractors account for this increase by a loss of the market for breeze and fine ash and the increased cost for "shoots" to deposit the refuse. * The cost has now arrived at such a figure that the Vestry ought seriously to consider whether this work of removal and disposal of the house refuse might not be more cheaply and efficiently done by employing their own labour. 35 Dusting Account—January to December, 1893.

The occupier of any premises fronting, adjoining, or abutting on any street not repairable by the inhabitants at large shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the cessation of any fall of snow, remove 40 or cause to be removed from the footways and pavements adjoining such premises and forming part of such street all snow fallen or accumulated on such footways and pavements in such a manner and with such precautions as will prevent any undue accumulation in any channel or carriageway or upon any paved crossing. The person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of the premises, or if there is no such person, then any person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of any part of the premises, and in the case of any premises the whole of which is let in tenements or to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the tenants or lodgers, either on his own account or as the agent of another person, shall for the purposes of this bye-law be deemed to be the occupier. 3. Every person who shall remove any snow from any premises on to any carriageway shall deposit the same in such a manner and with such precautions as to prevent any accumulation thereof in any channel or upon any paved crossing. If in the process of such removal any snow be deposited upon any footway or pavement in any street, he shall forthwith remove such snow from such footway or pavement. 4. Every person who shall throw any salt upon any snow on the footway of any street shall do so in such quantity and in such manner as effectually to dissolve the whole of such snow, and he shall forthwith effectually remove from the footway the whole of the deposit resulting from the mixture of the salt with the snow. He shall not place any part of such deposit on the carriageway of such street elsewhere than in proximity to any channel at the side of such carriageway, and he shall not remove any part of the same into any such channel unless it is sufficiently liquid to flow along such channel. No person shall throw any salt upon any snow on the carriageway of any street, unless it shall be practicable forthwith effectually to remove the whole of the deposit resulting from the mixture of the salt with the snow. Every person who shall throw any salt upon any snow on any such carriageway shall forthwith effectually remove the whole of the deposit, but he shall not place any part thereof on the footway of such street or on any paved crossing, or on the carriageway in such a manner as to interefere with the carriage traffic, nor shall he place any part thereof in the channel at the side of the carriageway unless it is sufficiently liquid to flow along such channel. 5. A person shall not throw, cast, or lay, or cause to be thrown, cast, or laid, any dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth or other like matter or thing in or upon any part of a street. 41 Provided always that this byelaw shall not apply to any act which is for the time being an offence within the meaning of any public general statute, or of any byelaw made by the London County Council and in force in the place where such act is done. Provided also that it shall not be an offence against this byelaw to lay any ashes or other suitable material in any street in time of frost to prevent accidents. 6. Every person who shall lay or cause to be laid in any street any litter or other matter in case of sickness to prevent noise, shall lay the same so that it may be evenly distributed over the surface of the part of the street intended to be covered, and shall, when the occasion ceases, within forty-eight hours thereafter remove or cause to be removed from such street the litter or other matter so laid in such street.

For the Prevention of the keeping of Animals on any Premises in such place or manner as to be a Nuisance or injurious or dangerous to Health. Keeping of animals on premises. 8- The occupier of any premises shall not keep nor allow to be kept any animal on such premises iu such a place or in such a manner as to pollute, or to be likely to pollute, any water supplied for use or used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, or any water used or likely to be used in any dairy. 9. Every occupier of a building or premises wherein or whereon any horse or other beast of draught or burden, or any cattle may be kept, shall deposit or caused to be deposited in a suitable receptacle all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or noxious matter other than urine and other liquid filth which may, from time to time, be produced in the keeping of any such animal in such building or upon such premises. 42 He shall likewise provide in connection with such building or premises a sufficient drain, constructed in such a manner, and of such materials, and maintained at all times in such a condition, as effectually to carry away all urine and liquid filth or refuse therefrom. Except where the Sanitary Authority by notice duly given under the statutory provision in that behalf shall have otherwise required, he shall, once at least in every week, remove or cause to be removed from such building or premises all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or noxious matter produced in or upon such building or premises, and deposited in a receptacle as hereinbefore required. Provided that this requirement shall not apply to the occupier of any stable or cowhouse from which the Sanitary Authority remove or contract for the removal of manure and other refuse matter. Where for the purpose of preventing the keeping of any horse or other beast of draught or burden or any cattle on any premises so as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, it is necessary that the floor of the building in which such animal is kept should be impervious to liquid matter, no person shall keep any animal in such building unless or until the floor thereof shall have been paved with a hard and impervious pavement evenly and closely laid and so sloped as to effectually carry off all liquid matter therefrom to a properly trapped inlet to a drain hereinbefore required to be provided.
