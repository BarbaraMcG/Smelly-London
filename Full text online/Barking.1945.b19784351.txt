Public Health Department, Barking, Essex. 01 November, 1946. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barking. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, This is a book about the health of the people of Barking ; mostly, it will have to do with the health of the people during the year 1945, but here and there in particular, and almost throughout the whole of the book in general, I shall have in mind the health of the people of Barking during the last eighteen years and more that I have been in Barking. It seems to me desirable I should write this book in this way because today we stand at the end of an age. The Education Act has altered Local Government fundamentally throughout the country and the National Health Bill foreshadows still further, if not more fundamental, changes in Local Government. 8 The blue-print of things to come has been drawn up. It is not for me to say good or bad about the blueprint, but I do think it does behove me, and many others who, like me, have given their lives to work under the old order of things, to say what has been achieved and wherein we have failed. It is possible to write thus now when the course of things has been determined, because there is now no opportunity of influencing policy, and I believe it is obligatory that this should be done in order that the work of the men and women of my generation shall be recorded for the historians of the future, that is, if, having regard to the advent of the atom-bomb, we are to have a future. It has been the fate of people who have been pioneers that they resist the necessary codification and regimentation which are necessary in the more settled state of affairs which follows the freedom of pioneering days. To a certain extent, no doubt, I am influenced by this general tendency, but, insofar as all that I have to say is fact concerning the days that are gone, I do not believe that any personal factor can invalidate the story I have to tell. To begin with, I want to set forth the services which have been achieved in the past. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, C. LEONARD WILLIAMS, Medical Officer of Health: 9 SUMMARY OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND FACILITIES FOR TREATMENT Ambulance Service:—This is a comprehensive service for which a “nocharge” scheme is in being.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. 1. Births. The number of live births during the year 1945 shows a decrease over the previous year. There were 1,144 live births compared with 1,270 in 1944. There were 33 still births—the figure for the previous year being 31. Towards the end of the year, the number of confinements per month showed an increase over the earlier months and the amount of ante-natal work with which your officers were faced foreshadowed a considerable increase in this work for the year 1946. 2. Deaths. (a) General. During the year 328 deaths were registered in Barking and of these 12 were in respect of nonresidents. Taking into account residents who died elsewhere and excluding the deaths of visitors we get a nett figure of:— Males. Females. Total. 314 297 611 16 The principal causes of deaths are shown in the following table, supplied by the Registrar General. (NET DEATHS) Causes of Death. Total.

Forty-live children under the age of one year died during the period under review, there being 36 such deaths in the year 1944. A table showing the actual causes of death of these children under one year of age is set out hereunder:— 0-1 mth. 1-3 mths. 3-6 mths. 6-9 mths. 9-12 mths. Total under 1 year.

The fact that twenty-six died within the first month, leaving only nineteen deaths for the remaining eleven months of the first year of life, shows that our chief problem is still the mortality among the newly born. Of the twenty-six babies who died under the age of one month, no less than seventeen died within the first week. 19 The Infant Mortality Rate for 1945 is 38.56. In presenting my Annual Report to you last year, I made no comment on the spectacularly low infant mortality rate of 28.35, because, whilst I looked upon this as a welcome incident, I believed it to be purely incidental. I further believe that the only figure worth boasting about would be the figure over a five year period which for the period ending in 1944 was 33.99. This in my opinion was at this present stage of knowledge and social development quite good. This year, therefore, the presenting of an infant mortality rate of 38.56 does not distress me although it is more than 10 points higher than last year. Our figure for the now last five years is 34.64 and this, I believe to be a more reliable picture of the situation than that given by the figure for one particular year. In my Report last year, I set forth some of the factors influencing this rate and this year I would like to repeat myself, bringing the figures up-to-date:— 1. Education. 2. Nutrition. 3. Housing. 4. Attention at birth:— Total number of births .. 1,179 Upney 485 Midwives on District 458 Doctors on District 14 Radlett, etc. 150 Others (Class A) 2 Others (Class B) 70 1,179 20 5. Ante-Natal Supervision and Hospital treatment:— Births as above 1,179 Visits to expectant mothers 1,902 Visits to children under one year 7,186 Total number of women who attended Ante-Natal Clinics 2,053 6. Child Welfare:— Total number of children who first attended Centres during the year who at their first attendance were under one year 1,090 7. Other Special Services:— Dental, Eyes, Ears, Skin, Chiropody and. Orthopaedics. This year, I would like to add to my remarks of last year the submission I have made elsewhere, to wit that a maternity and child welfare service to be complete must have a number of beds set apart for ante-natal patients, which is just as important as having beds in a maternity home for special cases on medical groundsand for cases where the social circumstances are such that it is not proper for the children to be born at home. It is not only necessary to have beds for ante-natal cases, who may be seriously ill, but also for cases who of necessity must observe a special regime, including a special diet, which in the ordinary nature of thingsthe expectant mother will not observe on advice alone. 21 The following table gives comparative infant mortality rates for the past 20 years:— COMPARATIVE INFANT MORTALITY RATES.

England and Wales. 1926 59 73 70 1927 66.1 71 69 1928 63.3 70 65 1929 53.4 79 74 1930 61.3 64 60 1931 64.4 71 66 1932 53.4 69 65 1933 55.6 67 64 1934 56.7 63 59 1935 52.2 62 57 1936 56.07 63 59 1937 53.8 62 58 1938 39.5 57 53 1939 33.91 53 50 1940 32.98 61 56 1941 36.3 71 60 1942 35.68 59 49 1943 37.2 58 49 1944 28.35 52 46 1945 38.56 54 46 (c) Maternal Mortality. Four Barking women died owing to or in consequence of pregnancy or childbirth during 1945. There was one such death in the year 1944. The Maternal Mortality Rate for 1945 is 3.3. This rate is the ratio between the number of births and the number of women who died in childbirth, expressed as “so many” per thousand. 22 3. Social Conditions. (a) Social Services. Your Social Services cover a very wide field and are extensively used by the public, which in itself gives a true indication of their popularity, necessity and efficiency. (b) Asbestosis. Those who in this way or in that have been forced to take an interest in the tragic incidence of asbestosis in Barking may wish to refresh their memories of what was done in the Town during the years 1928-1930 by reference to my earlier Annual Reports. For the purposes of this Annual Report, I would wish to quote only from my Annual Report for 1930. On page 19 of this Report I wrote as follows:— “It is not unreasonable to suppose that for the next fifteen years we shall be getting deaths from asbestosis amongst those people whose lungs are already affected.” The fifteen years which in 1930 I thought would see the tragic end of so many of these then affected people have come and gone and we still have deaths in Barking from Asbestosis. I can well believe that some of the deaths occurring today are due to the inhalation of asbestos dust more than 15 years ago, but my records are not sufficient for me to say whether some of the deaths occurring today are not due to or aggravated by the inhalation of dust during the past 15 years. In this connection, I am tempted to quote from another Annual Report, to wit my Report for 1929, where on page 64, I wrote as follows:— 23 “The fact that the health of workers in factories is under one Ministry and the health of these same workers outside the factories is under another Ministry is essentially bad.” Today, I am afraid that such a statement might be held to be verging very dangerously on policy. Perhaps I was more courageous when I was young, perhaps the times have changed, but there can be no doubt that what I said in 1929 is still as true today as it was then. I am not in a position to assess the essential necessity of asbestos and its products to our national economy, but I am firmly of the opinion it is a deadly and dangerous commodity, and that unless those who are charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the health of the people in the industry can give positive assurances that they have now after all these years removed every possible danger, the processing of asbestos, except in so far as its products are essential to our national economy, should be barred. (b) Scales of Assessment. Only minor changes in your scales have been adopted during the year. It is, however, worth recording that the Education Act, 1944, provides that free medical treatment shall be available for all pupils in attendance at school. (d) Employment. In previous years this part of my Report has been entitled “unemployment,” but at the suggestion of the Manager of the Barking Branch of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, with whom there has 24 been consultation, I am altering it to "employment," because undoubtedly the present trend is for increased emphasis to be made upon employment rather than unemployment As a matter of fact, unemployment in Barking in 1945 was practically non-existent On the termination of hostilities there was a small increase in the number of persons without employment, chiefly amongst persons who were changing their employment from war to civilian production. On the 10th December 1945, there were, however, only 118 insured persons without employment registered at the Barking Employment Exchange. The demand for labour has been greatly in excess of the supply but the importation of labour from other regions has not been possible, except in small numbers, owing to the difficulty in securing lodging accommodation in this and adjacent areas. A marked feature of industry during the war years has been the services rendered by married women, who were called upon to assist in the national effort. During the latter part of 1945, there was a visible tendency for married women to leave industry, due no doubt to increasing domestic responsibilities consequent upon the return of evacuee children and men returning home from the Forces. During the year, work was commenced at a site in Thames Road on the erection of a new Government Training Centre for training building trade workers. This Centre will be completed during 1946 and will provide for about 600 trainees at a time. 25 (e) Travelling Facilities. Time and time again, particularly, of course, before the war, I have made adverse comments on the facilities for travelling to and from Barking, and I do feel this is a major issue which must be faced. The difficulties which, as advised, 1 believe will have to be faced if improvements are to be made, and the length of time I am advised it must take in order to overcome these difficulties, make it the more imperative that steps should be taken forthwith to begin to deal with this urgent matter. It is true one hundred per cent, that coughs and sneezes spread diseases, and even in ordinary conversation there is an invisible but nevertheless real and dangerous droplet spray coming out of the mouth carrying germs of infection. Crowded as the trains are at peak-loads in the morning and the evening, the danger of infection is considerable, particularly, of course, during the evening, when the people are returning to Barking, tired not only with their day's work, but tired also from the added strain of travelling, standing cheek by jowl in uncomfortable positions, with little or no opportunity of steadying themselves against the erratic movements of the floor on which they are standing. The amount of time lost due to these infections must be considerable. There is, however, a most insidious loss in production due to the fact that everybody has only, after all, so much energy to expend during the day, and if constantly a man or woman is called upon to endure with fortitude, the 26 ordeal of travelling back from work to Barking, he or she must inevitably conserve sufficient energy for this, which, after all, is an arduous undertaking. This conservation of energy for what should be an unnecessary hardship, represents loss in production which can scarce be over-estimated. On a visit to Town to attend an important meeting, I left the same hurriedly at the termination of the business—whilst yet it would have been advantageous for me to continue informal discussions with my colleagues—because the time was about four o'clock in the afternoon, and I had no wish to brave the dangers of travelling during a rush-hour. This incident I well remember because, at the Station on my way home, I met a man from Barking who pointedly remarked that if I had only waited another hour, I should have had another chapter to write in my Annual Report. I am told, and can quite well believe, that there is only one way to deal with the situation, and that is to double the line between Town and Barking. I am told that this would be a five year's job ; I am told it would be enormously expensive so far as manpower is concerned. I do confidently believe that such expenditure would be an economy so long as so very many people in Barking and in the neighbourhood of Barking are constrained to travel to and fro to earn their living. 27 SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. i. General Health Services. (a) Ambulance Facilities. With the concurrence of the Fire Force Commander of the area, your ambulance service was transferred from the St. Paul's Road Depot to the Fire Station, from where it used to operate prior to the war. During the year, the ambulance service of the Borough was reviewed, having regard to the changeover from a civil defence to a peace-time service. It was decided that the service should be supplemented and, in this connection, two ex-civil defence vehicles were purchased for use as sitting case cars. Altogether, 5,532 patients were conveyed during the year, representing over one thousand more than those conveyed during 1944. Reciprocal arrangements remain in force with neighbouring Authorities. (b) Hospital Facilities. Oldchurch County Hospital is our main standby in Barking, but numbers of cases are admitted to the voluntary hospitals in London, including the London Hospital and King George Hospital. The waste of time in the interchange of medical opinions between your officers and the medical men in some of these hospitals still continues. 28 The main point for consideration, however, is not hospital facilities but the lack of such facilities. I have visitors, averaging more than one per week, imploring me to do whatever may be possible to expedite admission to sanatoria and other hospitals and, of course, the terrible tragedy is that even the insufficient number of beds that have been provided are not all in use owing to the difficulty in obtaining the requisite number of staff, both trained and untrained. Once again, as in previous years, I have to report the Corporation has again allocated the sum of £500 which has been distributed to the hospitals in London and in the neighbourhood of Barking for their services in connection with out-patients and other attendances of children from the Barking area. (c) Clinics and Treatment Centres. Your Clinics and Out-patient Departments are always in great demand and the attendances in the year we are now dealing with totalled 115,000. This compares with 113,989 in the year 1944 and 126,500 in 1943. (d) Chiropody Clinic. There can be no doubt this service is meeting a very real demand and it is highly appreciated by the public generally. So far as I know, the only troubles we have arise from the fact that the demand is greater than we can meet. The difficulty is, of course, in obtaining suitable premises and this difficulty is likely to be felt so long 29 as the housing situation is so acute as it is today. There is, however, the possibility that the Woodward Civil Defence Depot, built on the site of the Woodward Clinic which was blitzed during the war, may be opened as a health centre and this will provide at least one chair in a part of the town not at present covered and will do away with the necessity for people in that area travelling all the way to the centre of the town for this service. Actually, I anticipate that when this service is provided in the different localities of the town the demand will be even greater than it is today. The number of treatments given at this clinic during the year shows a substantial increase over that for 1944. This increase was due to the extra sessions held and the special effort made to reduce the waiting list which was just under 2,000 at the beginning of the year. Your arrangements for evening sessions continue. (e) Endocrine Clinic. Endocrinology is the science of the balance which exists between the glands of the body the products from which are distributed throughout the body bv the blood stream. The following statistics show the activity of this clinic. Year 1944 Year 1945[/##] 1. Treatment Sessions 1,307 1,530 2. Total Individual Patients 3. New Patients 2,006 1,233 2,475 1,179 4. Total treatments given 8,537 10,222 5. Infra-red treatments (included in 4) 578 595 30 We did, during the war, set up an endocrine clinic as an experiment and we were only able to do so because I had at the Barking Hospital an officer who was particularly interested in this special work. I would wish to put on record I am profoundly impressed with the need there is to make the results of recent researches into endocrinology more available to the public than they are at the present time. Quite frankly, behaviour is so often intimately linked with endocrine balance that I look upon the psychologist as a second line of defence in dealing with its problems and the endocrinologist as the first line of defence, although, not of necessity, our chief defence. (f) Skin Clinic. Your Specialist Consultant in Skin Diseases, Dr. Arthur Burrows, has continued to hold his weekly session at the Barking Hospital, and in addition the two treatment sessions have been held throughout the year. The following statistics illustrate the extent of the use of this sendee for the years 1944 and 1945. Consultations. Treatments. Year ended 31st Dec., 1944 Year ended 31st Dec., 1945 Year ended 31st Dec., 1944 Year ended 31st Dec., 1945 Sessions 43 47 102 101 Attendances:— Children under 5 years 134 139 295 300 Children 5-15 years 175 277 383 975 Ante Natal & Post Natal Cases 61 126 97 114 Other categories (including Public Adult Scheme) 57 167 142 171 Ji (g) Scabies. Scabies is at present notifiable within the Borough, in accordance with an order approved by the Minister of Health under Section 147 (1) of the Public Health Act of 1936. You have continued to provide baths and outpatient treatment. Statistics of the cases reported and treated during the year under review are as follows :— New Cases Recurring Cases Total Total number of patients 904 118 1,022 Adults 459 38 497 Children 445 80 525 Referred from :— Clinics 394 84 478 Other sources 510 34 544 Number of cases cleansed at the the Barking Hospital:— Adults 293 29 322 Children 386 75 461 (h) Specialist Clinic for Children. Dr. Doyne Bell, your Consultant Paediatrician, held his first clinic at the Barking Hospital in November, 1945. This clinic, which is held fortnightly, is available for all young children where special consultation is considered necessary. (i) General District Nursing. The Plaistow Maternity Hospital and District Nurses Home and the East Barking District Nursing Association provide skilled nursing in the home for all people in the Borough. 32 The work is carried out efficiently by these organisations and the Council give considerable financial aid. During the year 1945, the District Nursing visits for the whole of the Borough totalled 20,248, and for the year 1944 this figure was 18,031. (2) Maternity and Child Welfare Services. (a) Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Supervision. There has been an increase in the number of attendances at your Ante-Natal, Post-Natal and Gynaecological Clinics, due to the ending of the war and the consequent return of families from evacuation. Statistics in relation to these attendances for the years 1944 and 1945, are given below :— Attendances. Year 1944 Year 1945 Ante-Natal 11,000 11,832 Post-Natal 671 819 Gynaecological 734 810 (b) Alidivifery. (i) Supervision.—There were seventeen midwives practising in the Borough at the end of the year, 11 of whom were employed at the Barking Maternity Unit. During the year 1945, midwives sought medical assistance in 130 cases; 43 of these were on behalf of babies. 33 (ii) Domiciliary Midwifery.— During 1945, 471 domiciliary cases were delivered in Barking. In addition, 15 mothers were delivered by doctors with district midwives in attendance (iii) Analgesia in Domiciliary Midwifery.—All of the six domiciliary midwives practising in Barking at the end of the year were qualified to administer gas and air analgesia. Analgesia was administered in 188 domiciliary confinement cases. (c) Barking Maternity Unit (Upney Maternity Pavilion and beds in Barking Hospital). At the Upney Maternity Pavilion during 1945, 476 patients were confined, 32 patients were admitted for ante-natal treatment, 10 for post-natal treatment, and there was one miscarriage. At the Barking Hospital the following cases were dealt with :— Ante-Natal 205 Gynaecological 50 Miscarriages 12 Post-confinement cases 42 During 1945 no deliveries actually took place in the Barking Hospital, but 30 mothers were transferred from Upney Maternity Pavilion after delivery (included in the 42 post-confinement cases shown above). (d) Emergency Maternity Homes. The evacuation of expectant mothers to Radlett continued until August, when the home there was closed. 34 Certain of the Homes to which expectant mothers were evacuated during the war years have been retained by the Government for the reception of maternity cases from the Metropolitan Area where the home conditions are such that domiciliary confinement is impracticable and there is no maternity bed available in the area of residence. The scheme is operated by the London County Council and we have been participants therein. A total of 222 mothers were confined in reception areas during the year. (e) Home Helps. You had on your panel at the end of the year six home helps, but of these one was not available for a considerable part of the year because of illness. The services of these home helps were made available in 50 confinement cases. In addition, 19 cases were attended by private home helps paid by you. (f) Infant Welfare Centres. There were 51,552 attendances at your Infant Welfare Clinics, the figure for the year 1944 being 26,345. (g) Home Visiting. Home Visiting is an important part of a Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme and during the year 16,087 such visits were made. (h) Priority Dockets for Sheets. During the year under review, 1,083 dockets for the supply of sheets were issued to 418 expectant mothers to be confined in their own homes. 35 (i) Ophthalmia Neonatorum. After twenty-five years as a Medical Officer of Health, I am happy to be able to say that not one of the many cases of ophthalmia neonatorum with which I have dealt administratively has ever had any residual disability. Hitherto, I have been at pains not to halloo until we are out of the woods but now that treatment by penicillin and other new drugs is added to our armamentorium and the future appears to be assured I believe that we can begin to boast of the good results which were achieved before the advent of these new and wonderful drugs. (j) Adoption of Children {Regulation) Act, 1939. Section 7 of this Act requires all persons participating in any arrangements for the placing of children to notify the Welfare Authority in writing.—No such notifications were received in the year 1945. (k) War-time Daj Nurseries. These nurseries were primarily established to meet wartime conditions but experience has shown they should be an integral feature of the social services provided by a local authority. Nurseries are required chiefly for :— (a) Women who are forced by circumstances to earn a living in order to support their children, e.g. unmarried mothers and widows ; (b) To assist domestic arrangements during confinements and family illness ; 36 (c) To train and provide for the welfare of the preschool age child ; (d) To provide leisure hours for mothers. It would also be an added advantage if provision could be made for a number of children to be resident, because this would be of great value in dealing with the cases outlined in (b) above. The three Day Nurseries maintained by you are situated at Castle Green, Eastbury House and Lodge Farm. During the year certain difficulty was experienced in maintaining adequate staffs at these nurseries. (3) ORTHOPAEDIC SERVICES. During the year, fifteen consultation sessions were held by Mr. A. M. A. Moore, your Specialist Consultant. Difficulty was again experienced in obtaining qualified physiotherapists and, whereas you have established three such posts, only one physiotherapist was employed for some months of the year. The average daily attendances during the yea: (excluding Saturdays) were as follows:— Castle Green 28 Eastbury House 48 Lodge Farm 31 37 PARTICULARS OF THE WORK DONE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC DURING 1945.

The number of sessions held by your Specialist Consultant during the year was 45, as againts 41 for 1944. We have continued our arrangements with the Queen Mary's, King George and St. Mary's Hospitals, for the operative treatment of ear, nose and throat defects. Statistics, in relation to the Ear, Nose and Throat Scheme are set out hereunder :— Mothers & Toddlers Adults— Public Scheme School Children Total Year 1944 Year 1945 Year 1944 Year 1945 Year 1944 Year 1945 Year 1944 Year 1945 Number of Attendances at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic 208 267 36 64 772 770 1,016 1,101 Number of cases which received operative treatment .. 34 85 214 263 248 348 Number of cases which received other forms of treatment 61 52 14 27 296 353 371 432 (5) OPHTHALMIC SERVICES. The Council have established the post of Ophthalmic Nurse, but the actual appointment is still in abeyance because once again we have not succeeded in obtaining a suitable candidate. 39 (a) Treatment of Defective Vision.—The following statistics of the work of your Ophthalmic Clinics show that more cases have been dealt with than in the previous year. Mothers & Toddlers Adults— Public Scheme School Children Total Year 1944 Year 1945 Year 1944 Year 1945 Year 1944 Year 1945 Year 1944 Year 1945 Errors of Rcfraction, etc. requiring treatment 221 222 281 416 663 903 1,144 1,541 Number for whom spectacles were (a) Prescribed 68 109 206 239 519 485 793 833 (b) Obtained 35 37 163 194 356 438 554 669 (b) Squint Training. Under all the circumstances this Clinic in my opinion has been well attended in spite of the drop of over 100 in the total attendances, as compared with the number in the year 1944. Statistical data of this Service is given hereunder :— Year 1944 Year 1945 Number of Sessions 102 86 Number of Children Attended 44 29 Number of New Cases 13 8 Number of Old Cases 31 21 Number of Attendances 610 467 Number Discharged—Cured 3 3 Number Evacuated 11 Number Left School 3 4 Number Discontinued 8 5 40 (6) DENTAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT. Your dental services have again been considerably affected by the difficulty in getting dentists, and although all possible steps have been taken to overcome this difficulty, it has been necessary to curtail these services and there has been a further fall in the number of patients treated. There were 5,957 attendances under your public Adult Dental Scheme, the number in the previous year being 6,649. Statistics as to the cases dealt with in the years 1944 and 1945, under your Public Adult anc Maternity and Child Welfare Dental Schemes are as follows :— Scheme Year ended 31st Dec., 1944 Year ended 31st Dec., 1945 (a) Number of Visits of Patients to Clinics 7,977 7,705 (b) Number of Dentures Supplied 1,363 1,144 41 SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. (1) RAINFALL. The rainfall for the year ended 31st December, 1945, was 17.99 inches, as compared with 19.66 for the previous year. Rain fell on 138 days in the year 1945. (2) WATER SUPPLY. There was no extension of mains during the year 1945. Samples are drawn from the domestic supplies and submitted quarterly for chemical and monthly for bacteriological examination. All samples were reported pure and wholesome and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. (3) DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Drainage arrangements continue as heretofore. (4) RIVERS AND STREAMS. The position remains as in previous years. (5) CLOSET ACCOMMODATION. At the end of the year, there remained a total of 10 premises unconnected with the sewer, 7 of which were factory premises. The remainder were sports pavilions situated upon the marshes. 42 (6) PUBLIC CLEANSING. During the year 4,220 loads of refuse were collected with an average weight of 1.91 tons per load. The practice of a daily collection of waste food and a fortnightly collection of other domestic refuse continued. (7) REFUSE DISPOSAL. The refuse of the Borough, by arrangement with the County Borough of East Ham, was taken to the destructor works of that Authority. (8) SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. The war damage repairs, consequent upon the serious destruction caused by enemy action, occupied almost completely the labour engaged in the district. The decline in the standard of maintenance, owing to the wear and tear and neglect of the war years, continued. There was, therefore, greater need for inspection, with less resulting improvement as the consequence of such inspection. The controls introduced to safeguard the proper use of materials and labour increased the work of your officers, who were called upon to deal with the resulting licensing requirements. During the difficult times through which we were passing, everything that could be done was done to prevent a sanitary breakdown and with this your officers had to be satisfied. With the return of members of the Forces and families from evacuation the need for new accommodation became more pronounced. This demand necessitated more visits to investigate claims of overcrowding. 43 During the year 2,654 complaints were registered by the public, compared with 1,538 for the previous year.

The following is a list of the above type of premises :— (1) Houses let in lodgings. (2) Tents, Vans and Sheds. (3) Underground sleeping rooms. (4) Offensive Trades (5) Piggeries. (6) Stables. 46 (d) Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919. The propaganda carried out by the Ministry of Food, calling attention to the importance of the conservation of food as an essential in the difficult first year after the war, has had its effect. We find, increasingly, the general public immediately bring to our notice any spoiling of food by rats or any damage to property. It is also generally recognised that in order to prevent surface infestation the repair of drains and sewers must be well maintained. The shortage of labour was still acute during the year and we were unable to carry out the radical sewer treatment which had been scheduled but sewer baiting continued. With the evidence now collected, it is felt that satisfactory treatment can be completed during the year 1946. We have throughout the year employed one rat operative, who has been engaged continuously in dealing with minor infestations, with success. (9) ERADICATION OF BED BUGS. Following the cessation of the war, the manufacturers of insecticides commenced the distribution of their proprietory brands containing D.D.T. The 47 development of such products focussed public attention upon the matter and consequently we supplied many tenants with small quantities of the preparation for home use. In addition to this distribution, a small number of houses were treated as follows :— Barking Council Houses 6 Privately owned Houses 10 The use of such insecticides was more suitable than gaseous disinfestation, owing to the acute overcrowding conditions of the houses concerned. 49 SECTION D. HOUSING. (i) STATISTICS. (a) General. During 1945, no new houses were completed in the Borough. (b) Unfit Dwelling-Houses. 1. Inspection of dwelling-houses during the year (including War Damage Classifications):— (1) (a) Total number of dwellinghouses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 4,160 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 6,742 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses included under sub-head No.1 above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations 196 .

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD, (i) MILK SUPPLY. There are no cowkeepers in the district and we have only one dairy where milk is handled or treated. The remaining 39 premises on the register retail pre-packed supplies. In addition there are six milk purveyors who occupy premises in other districts, but retail in Barking. The following table sets out the results of the bacteriological examination of various samples. Type of Sample Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Totals "Pasteurised" Milk 36 5 41 "Homogenised" Milk 2 — 2 Tuberculin Tested Milk 16 5 21 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) Milk 4 3 7 Totals 58 13 71 With the rationalisation of distribution, the delivery of milk supplies in Barking is now the monopoly of the large multiple dairy companies, who are three in number. Except for tuberculin tested milk, the whole of the milk supply in the district is heat treated. 54 Owing to the monopoly of distribution, there is an increase in the frequency of complaints of staleness, due to the late delivery at the home, in the day's supply. The souring of milk in the existing conditions of shortage often means that for that particular day a family is without any supply. We hopefully look forward to the day when carton packed supplies of pasteurised milk are retailed freely in the shops once more. In addition, I cannot do better than repeat what I said in my Report for 1944 with regard to the milk industry:— "If the one delivery practice is to be maintained it will be essential for all homes to be fitted with refrigerated storage and for long-distance retail delivery prams and vans to be designed to protect supplies from the heat of the sun. It is to be regretted that the control of war-time labour supply to the milk industry did not permit the retention of the skilled employees at the processing plants. In every case when complaints were investigated it was found the trouble was due to lack of the right quality of labour in key positions." There were, during the year, 48 samples of milk submitted to biological examination for the presence of tubercle. In six cases the guinea-pig died prematurely. In no case was there a positive result. 55 The following table shows the number of licences granted during the year for the sale of graded milks under the Milk (Special Designations) Orders, 1936 and 1938:— Tuberculin Tested 8 Pasteurised 12 (2) MEAT AND OTHER FOODS. (a) Meat. Since the outbreak of war, slaughtering in Barking has been discontinued. (b) Supervision of Food Preparing Premises. The number of premises in the district at the end of the year at which the following foods are prepared were:— Sausages 21 Potted Meat and Brawn 2 Pressed, Pickled, Cooked, etc. Beef and Tongue 31 Boiled Crabs and Lobsters 3 Pickled Fish 1 Pickled Onions, etc. 1 Smoked Fish 8 Bakehouses 10 56 (c) Unsound Food. The following list can be regarded as representing the whole of the food handled or retailed in the district found unfit for consumption. Bacon 342 lbs. Bread and Flour 1,780 lbs. Cereals, Dried Fruits, etc. 1,615 lbs. Eggs 89 Fish 154 lbs. Meat 4,889¼ lbs. Provisions 1,828¾ lbs. Rabbits 9½ lbs. Sauces and Pickles 30 gallons Sugar 536½ lbs. Sweets 740 lbs. Tea 477¼ lbs. Various Fillings 2,794 tins, jars, etc. (3) FOOD POISONING. Only one case of food poisoning was notified during the year. (4) FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938, SAMPLING. During the year, your authorised officers have submitted a total of 232 samples, divided as follows:— Milk 26 Butter and Margarine 25 Others 181 232 57 The reports of the Borough Analysts show that of this total, sixteen were found not genuine. Of the unsatisfactory samples, six related to deficiencies of milk fat. On check samples being taken at the time of milking, it was found that the results were comparable with the unsatisfactory samples obtained. In view of this, proceedings were not taken but the producer was advised of the steps he should take to remedy the position. Samples of baking powder and mustard were reported to be unsatisfactory. It was found that the stocks had been in store for some time and were subsequently surrendered for destruction. One prosecution relating to a sample of gin which had a strength of 48.5° under proof, as compared with the standard of 35.o° under proof, was instituted. The case, however, was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act on payment by the Company concerned of £5 costs and on payment by the manager of the premises in question of £15 costs. The Borough Analyst in his reports called attention to the unsatisfactory position with regard to cocktail tonics. The facts were reported to the Ministry of Food who, we are advised, are now about to introduce standards for such preparations. Ginger wine cordials were examined and found to consist of a solution of sugar containing a little citric acid and flavoured with ginger. It was a non-alcoholic preparation but was not so described on the label. It is felt that preparations of this nature should be clearly labelled as non-alcoholic to avoid the public being misled. 58 The wrappers of all samples of pre-packed foodstuffs have been carefully scrutinised in order to establish whether or not they comply with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order. (5) CHEMICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FOOD. The bacteriological examination of all milk and water samples is carried out for this Authority by the Counties Public Health Laboratories, of Gidea Park College, Essex, whilst the examination of samples of milk for the presence of tubercle is carried out by Dr. A. L. Sheather, of Chorleywood, Herts. The Borough Analysts are Dr. B. Dyer and Dr.; J. H. Hamence, Peek House, Eastcheap, London, E.C. 59 SECTION F.

At the end of 1944, it was noted that the number of cases of measles was steadily increasing and in the first half of 1945 the number of cases reported reached epidemic proportions. The peak of the epidemic was reached in March and it was not until June that it could be said the epidemic was over. Of the 1,102 cases notified during the year, approximately 1,000 occurred during February, March, April and May. The following table shows the incidence of measles for the past four years:— Year. Notifications. 1942 1,260 1943 797 1944 151 1945 1,102 64 (10) DIPHTHERIA. During the year there was a slight increase in the number of cases of diphtheria notified. The following table shows the incidence of diphtheria for the past four years:— Year. Notifications. 1942 57 1943 35 1944 9 1945 16 During the year 1945, there was only one death from diphtheria. This occurred in the case of a child who died within one week of returning to Barking, after being evacuated to the country. (11) ARTIFICIAL IMMUNISATION. The estimated mid-year population for 1945 of children under the age of five years is 5,590 and of this total 2,912 were successfully immunised. A similar population estimate of children between the ages of 5 and 14 years is 11,740 and of this total 9,313 were successfully immunised. This means that for 1945, approximately 71 per cent, of the child population of Barking was successfully immunised against diphtheria. Immunisation against whooping cough continued but no requests were received for immunisation against scarlet fever during the year. 65 The following table shows the work undertaken at immunisation clinics during the past three years:— Year 1943 Year 1944 Year 1945 Inoculations against Diphtheria 7089 688 973 Inoculations against Scarlet Fever 49 3 — Inoculations against Whooping Cough 136 56 144 (12) VENEREAL DISEASE.
