At this moment it seems a good thing to study the progress of public health in the Borough since the onset of the last War a period of 25 years Prom 1339 to 1948 the Public Health Department controlled the Environmental Service, the Maternity and Child Welfare Service, the School Health Service and the Ambulance Service In 1948 resulting from the National Health Service Act, the Maternity and Child Welfare Service and the School Health Service control were taken over by the County Council and managed in Areas, Brentford and Chiswick being included in an area having also Southall and Heston and Isleworth, The Ambulance Service was taken by the County and management centralised. There has been steady improvement in the services for the control of infectious disease, for the inspection and improvement of the homes and workplaces of the people, for the supervision of hygienic production, importation, and handling of food so as to prevent dirty or diseased food causing disorder or disease to the people. These services were disrupted neither by War nor by the National Health Service Act But the Maternity and Child Welfare Services and the School Health Service, which had continued triumphantly and successfully through the War years in spite of air raids, limited amount of time in winter because of black-out requirements, and need for staff to carry out supplementary duties of many kinds because of the demands of War were shattered by the impactofthe new legislation. While -7- parents were ready and anxious to take their children to be treated for abnormalities of health to general practitioners, hospitals, or even to local health authority clinics, that wish, carefully cultivated by devoted Health Visitors through the years, to have attention to, and advice about healthy children to prevent disability or disease, became limited to the more devoted mothers only, particularly when Health Visitors became scarce because of lack of training facilities and the creation of too many supervisory grades Ante Natal Clinics however, which were linked in this area with Queen Charlotte's and the West Middlesex Hospitals, did not suffer so badly as in other areas and Brentford and Chiswick was exceptionally fortunate in having already developed a Chiropody Service, which was permitted to continue, though it never expanded, The Infant Clinics recovered after some years and began again to attract keen Health Visitors, who are the field workers best equipped to improve the clinic facilities and encourage the use of them by mothers who need help and some information on the upbringing of infants But now at last, the Public Health Department is to be responsible for the whole service, Environmental and Personal and, unless mistakes are made, at least partly responsible for Welfare and the Children s Services. Here is the opportunity to make atonement for the wasted years and to make a department which really serves the people, Administration must be personal decentralized and helpful There must be no more passing of enquiries from poor distressed citizens (who, after all, have to pay for the services) from one department to another Every member of every section of the Health Department should be willing to try to find the right person' to answer any problem, and the repellent words "Sorry, I cannot help you" should be forbidden The Sanitary Inspection service should continue, as now, to be immediately available to callers with problems of housing, or nuisance, to be the watchdog to guard against food or water borne disease, and to act instantaneously to limit the spread of epidemic diseases The Clinics should be brought up to the former standards, whether they are held in local authority buildings or in private practitioners premises, and there should be a two way traffic, with the mutual good will of the general practitioners and the local authority doctors, so that health visitors and secretarial staff can be made available for all maternity and child welfare clinics, with the simple condition agreed with general practitioners that appropriate records of those attending such clinics should be available for the use of the Medical Officer of Health for statistical and research purposes General practitioners should be able to refer directly to Special Clinics i.e for physiotherapy chiropody dentistry and orthodontic treatment, ophthalmic investigation, Day Nurseries and Day Hostels for the Chronic Sick should be provided at the earliest possible opportunity, to help those members of families who are willing and anxious to care for their children or disabled relatives but who either must work to live (i.e. widows widowers, unmarried mothers, unmarried sons or daughters of sick persons) or who need some relief from the heavy duty of constant care of children or sick relative (i.e. when in poor physical health), or when needed in some of the sorely pressed public services because of special qualifications but unable to work because of home ties (i.e. school teachers, nurses) Brentford and Chiswick had two local authority Day Nurseries, where children not only had good care and happy companionship, but where many mothers learned a great deal of mothercraft, now it has one only, but very many young children spend the days with strangers, unselected, unsupervised some excellent, some careless, some frighteningly incompetent. -8- The School Medical Service whereby all children are seen in school by a doctor with parents, and the Health Visitor in attendance and with the opportunity of a case conference with head teacher and class teacher to follow should be expanded to have routine inspection at ages 5, 8, 11 and 14 with yearly in spections after that age The Clinics to which children with minor ailments, injuries, and emergencies can be referred direct from the schools should be open every day all day, with a doctor either in attendance or on call. This saves much distress to school teachers who have to search for working parents, private doctors who are probably out visiting, or take or send the children to hospital. Equipment in offices and clinics should be brought up to date, good filing systems, plenty of intercommunicating and external telephones, visual aids for Health Education typewriters and dictographs are needed in individual offices and clinics, while for the department as a whole, part of the services of a printing department and of a computer for statistical surveys and reports are most important Mental Health, Little has been done as yet for this branch of Public Health in local authorities, One of the first links must be with the local Psychiatric Hospital and with the Psychiatric Units of the local general hospitals, and home visiting should be shared by hospital psychiatric social workers and local authority mental welfare officers. Day hostels and resident hostels for patients convalescing from mental illness are urgently necessary More training centres and greater variety of work opportunities are needed for those handicapped by mental subnormality or recovering from mental illness Welfare Since the War the social conscience has been stirred by the plight of the homeless the destitute, neglected and abandoned children, the disabled or handicapped and the lonely aged. The work of the Welfare Section is to accept responsibility for all of these, and the Medical Officer of Health has a duty to enlighten the local authority on how best to treat, or if possible prevent, these evils The homeless should be provided with homes, this is the true provision expected from Council housing to house the needy and the improvident for the sake of their children, The destitute should be gently helped in co operation with Church or Voluntary Association members, according to the circumstances the cause of destitution whether neglect, drink drugs, mental apathy or instability treated, and personality and self respect restored. The little children needing care because of inadequate or cruel parents or because of illness absence or death of parents should be as carefully treated and guarded as if the Department staff were their own parents and every fosterhome, or children s home, or family hostel should be subject to frequent and unheralded visiting by Department staff such as Health Visitors who will have the intelligence to recognize the signs of lack of care, malnutrition or unhappiness. Those disabled by crippling disease, deafness: or blindness are enough in number in a Borough of the size ofthenew one of which Brentford and Chiswick will be part, to require full scale provision of resident, of school, and of training facilities and of a school for educationally subnormal, supplemented by the provision of special classes in the day schools (there are still not nearly enough classes for the teaching of reading to children who have fallen behind in this skill)- Experiments in the use of the New Alphabet, and the Teaching Machine are desirable The lonely aged have had a fair amount of attention from the Welfare Department in the last few years but the new Welfare Section must do much more. The Home Help Service should belong to this section and should be greatly expanded. Meals for the housebound elderly and clubs and occupation centres to which the over 60 s can become attached should be organised by the Department through -9- voluntary bodies, and a central kitchen for delivery of meals to these premises provided A good night sitter service should be started and a transport service to convey the disabled elderly to clubs or clinics arranged The Welfare Section needs to provide homes of a completely different character from those at present in use in which elderly people who can no longer remain in their own homes would have decent privacy recreation and occupation if they so de sired, and a corner for their best loved possessions, Privacy and possessions, they cherish these and should not be forcibly deprived of them The Welfare Section and the Housing Department together should organise as soon as possible the building of many blocks of single room flatlets with some community service and warden, or the conversion of big houses into this same type of housing, which is likely to save the need for many old people s homes and saves hospital beds also. The Public Health Department will also need its own Mass X-ray Unit and its own Laboratory and its Chest Clinic should be expanded for the development of other services of after care such as the follow up of diabetes, gastric ulcer and other cases discharged from hospital The new Borough has a wonderful opportunity now to create a Public Health Department which will truly be aiding the people and maintaining Public Health I had expected to be given the opportunity of guiding this new Department into sound and progressive ways, but as this opportunity has not been granted to me, I have given the best advice I can in this limited preamble and I wish the Department success in prevention of disease and promotion of health in body and mind for everybody My last word is of gratitude to the officers of the Public Health Depart ment, past and present, who have helped me in our work through the years men tioning particularly the Chief Public Health Inspector Mr Robinson the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector Mr James and the Chief Clerk Mr Hill, All our staff members have worked hard to preserve good conditions for living in Brentford and Chiswick and have never failed to respond to a call for extra effort when necessary it might be because of the risk of epidemic disease,, or perhaps to enable such a Report as this to be finished to a deadline date, and I thank them all very sincerely I am Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant Mayaud ch.ylass Medical Officer of Health -10- Acknowledgements to P R.

There are 618 65 acres of open space within the Borough with ample facilities for refreshment and recreation both for the public in general and for the sporting activities of particular groups. The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25%, a very reasonable proportion for an urban area. -12- The average number of persons per inhabited house appears to have gone down from 3.28 in 1963 to 3 02 in 1964 which suggests that the number of overcrowded houses, whether private dwellings or houses in multiple occupation has at the very least, not increased during the year The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades artisans factory workers etc., and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds The amount of slum property is not considerable and progress continues to be made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation Information on the rehousing of the tenants in council houses and details concerning assessment of slum dwellings demoli tion and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report The unemployment figures for adult persons i.e. aged 18 and over, in the Borough at the end of 1964 shows a marked decrease compared with the previous year. At the end of 1964 there were 179 unemployed of which 158 were men and 21 women at the end of 1963 the total unemployed numbered 258 and the previous year 329 With regard to vacancies on 2nd December 1964 the number of vacancies outstanding was 406, (232 for men and 174 for women) and although the figure at December, 1963 was 468 taken as a whole throughout the year the demand was practically double the supply particularly with skilled work "The unemployment figures at the end of 1964 of young persons under 18 years of age were as follows Boys Girls Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31.12.64 6 3 9 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 9 5 14 Totals 15 8 23 Vacancies outstanding at 31.12.64 88 187 275 The local employment position followed the national trend during the year, and, whilst it was not difficult to find suitable vacancies at the beginning of the year the position became progressively easier as the year continued. Apprenticeships were not plentiful but extensive canvassing produced sufficient progressive vacancies for those boys who were suitably qualified to undertake them Some delay was experienced by boys who wanted semi skilled and unskilled work, but girls were in the fortunate position of being able to choose from plentiful vacancies in offices shops and factories There was an unexpectedly low demand for hairdressing apprenticeships and a high number of these vacancies were outstanding at the end of the year Many employers were unable to understand that there were insufficient young people available to meet all demands They read newspaper reports of severe unemployment in northern areas and assumed that these conditions applied equally in the London area. The officers explained the situation several times a day, emphasising the wide choice of vacancies for most occupations. Many vacancies notified for the summer term school leavers could not be filled and although every effort was made to submit young people who called for a change of employment there were still insufficient boys and girls available. This is reflected in the high number of vacancies outstanding on the 31st December."

Total number of persons using baths in 1964 106 485 Average number per day 750 Maximum number using baths on one day 3,807 The variation in figures from year to year is a very clear indication of the type of summer weather The summer of 1964 was the best for six years hot and sunny, and as a result the baths were used to more than capacity, and great care had to be taken that the water was clean and safe for the bathers The source of the water in the swimming baths was the mains supply of the Metropolitan Water Board In Brentford indoor bath the water went through a continuous filtration process the rate of change-over being about once every three hours. Additional purification was carried out by means of intermittent chlorination, the amount of free chloride aimed at being 0 6 parts per million. Water samples were taken by the Baths Staff two to three times daily throughout the season for the purposes of chemical analysis and pH estimation A scheme for the introduction of break point chlorination equipment was completed and ready for the summer season of 1964 at the Open Air Pools Chiswick. Its adoption proved successful Water sampling by the Public Health Department Officers was carried out frequently The Brentford Baths gave excellent results exceptontwo occasions when there was slight contamination at the shallow end which had been very crowded at the time of sampling After initial difficulties with the new treatment system at the Chiswick Pools results were uniformly excellent, Paddling Pools Duke's Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60 x 60 ) 7,200 sq.ft. Depth 6" to 1' in middle These paddling pools were emptied and refilled daily from the mains supply and Vi pint of Chloros was added at each filling It was considered, after bacteriological testing of the water on a few occasions that the amount of chlorination might not be sufficiently protective, and it was recommended that a slight increase in the initial dose of Chloros with the addition of further doses during the day should be carried out, and a concentration of not less than 0 6 parts of chlorine per million thus maintained. They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year according to weather conditions -15 Public Baths and Washhouses Brentford In Clifden Road Brentford the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths 14 for men and 7 for women The total number using the baths during 1964 was 16 289 persons Chiswick In Belmont Road Chiswick the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths 22 for men. and 9 for women In addition 2 hip baths are avail able particularly for the use of elderly persons The total number using the baths during 1964 was 37 223 In these premises are also 18 washing compartments comprising 18 coppers, a rinsing section (4 hydro extractors) 30 dicing horses hot air drying compart ments and 2 mangling machines Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour and during 1964 934 persons took advantage of the service -16- VITAL STATISTICS, 1964 Live Births Legitimate 994 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 18.87 Illegitimate 41 TOTAL 1,035 Stillbirths Total Male Female Legitimate 11 5 6 Rate per 1,000 total (Live and still) Births -11.46 Illegitimate 1 1 - TOTAL 12 6 6 Deaths Total Male Female 594 291 303 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 10.83 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis Rate per 1,000 total Other Puerperal Causes (live and still) Births Nil Deaths of Infants under 1 Year of Age Total Male Female Rate per l,000 live Births = 11.59 Legitimate 9 6 3 Illegitimate 3 3 - TOTAL 12 9 3 -17- Deaths and Death Rate The death rate fell considerably, from 12 31 in 1963, to 10 83 in 1964. This was the lowest death rate since 1960 In normal years the Registrar-General supplied a comparability factor, to allow for the way in which the sex and age of the local population differed from that of England and Wales as a whole, but this year the figure will be too late so a corrected death rate is not available, but for the past six years this factor has been 0.96 or l.0 for the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick and one may assume that the corrected death rate will be the same as, or very little less than the crude death rate Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation, The principal causes of death were:- 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 Circulatory Disease (including coronary disease) 217 259 245 218 215 201 222 215 Heart Disease 86 82 76 73 84 76 99 82 Cancer (including Leukaemis) 124 139 155 134 126 123 130 135 Deaths from Measles Nil Deaths from Whooping Cough Nil Deaths from Diphtheria Nil Deaths from Puerperal causes Nil Deaths from Tuberculosis 2 Deaths from Poliomyelitis Nil The distribution of cancer deaths in sites and ages are shown below, Site of Primary Growth Male Fema1e 1964 1963 1962 1961 1964 1963 19 62 1961 Stomach 7 9 6 9 5 5 8 7 Lung, Bronchus 20 23 34 26 9 11 7 7 Breast - - - - 10 18 13 15 Uterus - - - - 5 7 6 2 Intestinal 5 5 12 11 12 7 8 10 Prostate 1 6 5 9 = - - - Bladder 1 2 5 - 1 2 1 3 Brain 2 2 1 1 1 3 4 2 Other 18 18 17 15 20 21 25 17 Leukaemis 6 - 1 1 - 2 0 Totals 60 65 81 71 64 74 74 63 •18- Age Groups Male Female 1964 1963 1962 1961 1964 1963 1962 1961 Under 5 years - - 1 - - - - - Aged 5 9 years 1 - - - - - - - " 10 - 14 - - - - - - - - " 15 - 19 " - - 1 = - - - - " 20 - 24 „ - - 1 1 - 1 - - "25-29„ - - - - - - - - " 30 - 34 „ = 1 3 - - 1 - - "35 -39 „ 1 - 1 - = 1 2 « " 40 - 44„ - = - = 3 3 - 3 " 45- 49 „ 6 1 4 2 5 7 4 3 "50-54 „ 4 3 4 11 7 8 7 9 " 55 - 59 „ 8 11 7 6 9 10 5 5 " 60 - 64 " 14 16 10 13 9 10 4 8 "65-69„ 7 3 20 9 5 7 10 4 " 70 - 74„ 5 11 12 10 8 6 22 8 " 75 -79„ 8 8 6 7 9 9 11 12 80 84 „ 2 6 9 10 7 6 5 6 85 - 89 „ 3 5 2 2 1 2 3 4 " 90 = 94 " „ 1 - - - 1 3 1 1 Totals 60 65 81 71 64 74 74 63 Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis fell from 4in 1963 to 2 in 1964 There were no deaths from non pulmonary tuberculosis Year Numbep of deaths from.tuberculosis Ma1e Female Total 1954 3 1 4 1955 5 2 7 1956 5 1 6 1957 4 - 4 1958 3 4 7 1959 2 - 2 1960 1 - 1 1961 - 1 1 1962 2 3 5 1963 3 1 4 1964 1 1 2 The total number of deaths from violent causesi e motor vehicle accidents all other accidents and suicide was 24 These included 4 road accidents 10 suicides (sevenby domestic gas poisoning self administered one by barbiturate poisoning one self inflicted knife wound and one by precipitating himself in front of a public service vehicle) and 10 other accidents The number of accidental deaths fell from 13 in 1963 to 10 in 1964 and the details of these are in the following table Female age 79 Barbiturate poisoning Female age 76 Barbiturate poisoning Female age 75 fall from window at home Male age 43 barbiturate poisoning Male age 67 coal gas poisoning 19 Male age 28 drowning Male age 21 electrocution at work Male age 60 drowning Male age 59 struck by falling object at work Male age 69 fall at home Comparative figures from deaths from violent causes over the last 10 years are as follows: - 1964 196 3 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 24 28 27 22 32 26 23 23 26 27 Pour residents died through involvement in road accidents The ages of these cases were Maltas 83, 59. 16 Femalea s 70 None of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough The number of road accidents occurring within the Borough was 491, and the resultant number of casualties was 619 including 59 children Six persons were killed, five adults and one child Details are as follows.

In 1964, however the figures have to be taken by dates of birth on the notifications sent The variation is not likely to be great enough to affect the calculated birth rate viz 18 8 7 , compared with 18 92 in 1963 INFANT MORTALITY There were 12 deaths of infants under 1 year of age (14' in 1963), giving an infant mortality rate of 11 59 for 1964: This figure has been greatly reduced in the last two years, and the rate is the second lowest ever recorded in the Borough the lowest being 11,12 in 1960 The graph on page 22 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century -20- The number of premature infants born in 1964 was 67 (69 in 1963) including 7 premature stillbirths Of the 60 premature infants born alive, 3 were born at home all were surviving at the end of one month,, 57 were born in hospital, of whom 4 8 survived to the end of one month The percentage of premature infant births to total births (live and still) was 6 4 compared with 6,5 in 1963 The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1954 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 6.0 6.9 6.4 8.4 7.3 6.6 8.1 8.0 6.1 6.5 6.4 Causes of infant deaths are shown in Table II on page 78 The number of stillbirths was not so great in 1964, i.e. 12 (11 legitimate, 1 illegitimate) as against 14 (10 legitimate, 4 illegitimate).

Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care were provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting was carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic. They were also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B.C.G inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i.e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases, 52 children from Brentford and Chiswick were given B.C.G. at the Chest Clinic in 1964 A prominent part in the. treatment was played by domiciliary chemo therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council. Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Manage ment Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in Gen eral Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals, a Middlesex County Council Hostel was available for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training were provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis was dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic, B.C.G Vaccination As a result of the findings from the Tuberculosis Vaccinations Clinical Trial, which took place from 1950 to 1960 that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B.C.G, a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and if neces sary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13, During 1964, 617 children were invited to take part in the scheme 458 consents were received. These children were tuberculin tested and those found to be positive indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a minor or major degree at some period in their lives, were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation, 112 positives were so referred B, C, G. vaccination was carried out on 288 children 6 contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic. All tests and vaccinations during 1964 under this scheme were carried out by Middlesex County Council staff. HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1964 The housing conditions of 33 of the 40 cases of tuberculosis notified during the year were found to be as follows All patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, 15 in flats, 9 in houses and 9 in lodgings or furnished rooms, None of the patients were living in overcrowded conditions 27 The housing particulars of 7 cases had not been obtained by the end of the year because of difficulty of access by the Tuberculosis Visitors Two new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis In the case of a patient reported in 1963 to be living in a damp house, improvements were obtained by means of a sanitary notice and the case reported as overcrowded moved out of the Borough Thus the cases giving concern because of sanitary conditions at home had been cleared by the end of 1964 Mass X-Ray During 1964 the mobile Mass X ray unit made short visits to two factories in the Borough Details are as follows • Name of factory Number X rayed Bush Radio Ltd Power Road Chiswick 315 Trico Polberth Ltd Great West Road Brentford 782 Two active cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and one observation case were found none of these were residents of the Borough In addition one case of lung cancer was found a Borough resident. It is now possible to send persons desirous of availing themselves of the facility to a static Mass X ray Unit at West Middlesex Hospital without an appointment to have an X-ray of the chest. This is a very valuable addition to the armaments of preventive medicine and is made use of by many who need reassurance because of vague suspicions of contact. It is particularly useful to the Public Health Department for the obtainingof quick reports on candidates for employment on the Borough Council staff Over the last three years however it appears that the attendances of volunteers at this Unit have been falling The hours of attendance were altered some time ago whereby the Unit closes for an hour in the middle of the day and is not open on Saturday mornings or evenings It is difficult under these circumstances therefore for men and women workers to take advantage of the scheme and they need to be extremely health minded to be willing to overcome the difficulty by losing time from work Nevertheless the effort is worth while as tuberculosis is an insidious invader and can be well advanced before a patient is aware of illness it is also nowadays a disease very easy to cure in the early stages 28 GRAPH "B" GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1944 - 1964 29 FOOD CONTROL Work on the observation and improvement of hygienic reception storage and sale of food continued throughout the year. There were no prosecutions required becauseof failure to comply with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations The number of articles brought to the notice of the staff of the Public Health Department because of suspected unfitness for human consumption or because of being in some respect not of the nature substance or quality demanded was slightly lower than in 1963 and legal action was taken in fewer cases Details can be found on page 33 Observations of the management of food handling pre paration and vending continued in canteens shops public houses and food shops, and considerable attention was paid to hawkers of food market food stalls and ice cream vendors, The number of contraventions of the Pood Hygiene Regula tions was high in 1964 but the amount of work done to put matters right was very much higher than in previous years also so that a general rise in standards can be deduced from these figures (see page 32) Although there are still food premises which need much visiting and attention, many of the local traders go far beyond the requirements of the Pood and Drugs Act in their sanitary provisions Mobile traders are required to provide themselves with suitable washing facilities under the Pood and Drugs Act 1955 and their vehicles require to be checked from time to time. It will be seen from the list of contraventions on page 32, that one of these vans was found not to be suitably equipped and main tained and that one found so in the year 1963 had been brought up to standard in addition to the 1964 case NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 19 Butchers 38 Club Canteens 10 Confectioners (Sweets) 85 Cafes Restaurants Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 67 Factory and Staff Canteens 72 Fishmongers 15 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 42 Grocery and Provisions and General Stores 107 Ice Cream Manufacturers 1 Public Houses and Off Licences 81 School Canteens 16 Total 553 ICE CREAM The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc ) Regulations 1959 Throughout the year routine visits were paid to the one ice cream manufacturing premises situated within the Borough for the purpose of taking samples of ice cream ice lollies, etc for analysis In addition samples were taken from suppliers of ice cream etc manufactured in premises not within the Borough Periodic checks of the recording and indicating thermometers on the manu facturing apparatus were made and these were at all times found to satisfy the requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc ) Regulations 30 Sampling During the year 114 samples of ice cream were taken from the one ice cream manufacturing premises mobile vendors and shops in the Borough and the results obtained are as under Table A Bacterial Plate Count Method Plate Count Grade No, of Samp1es C1assification Less than 500 I 13 Excellent 500 to 20,000 II 19 Satisfactory 20,000 to 100,000 III 3 Doubtful Over 100,000 or Faecal Coli Present IV 3 Unsatisfactory Table B Methylene Blue Reduction Test Time of Reduction Grade No of Samp1es cation Fails to reduce in 4 hours I 35 Satisfactory 2½- 4 hours II 19 Fairly Satisfactory ½ - 2 hours III 7 Doubtful Less than ½ hour IV 15 satisfactory Readings are taken at half hourly intervals In addition, one sample of ice lolly was submitted for examination and was found to have a pH value of less than 4, 5„ For some years up to May 1964 ice cream samples in this Borough were examined by the bacterial plate count method which gave an accurate picture of the bacteriological condition of the ice cream (Table A), It could also indicate, if there was a poor bacteriological result of the samples, whether the contamination was due to faecal coli which could be attri buted to bad personal hygiene of food handlers, or to poor cleanliness of equip ment During 1964, the Public Health Laboratory staff of Ealing unfortunately found it impossible to continue the grading of ice cream by this method and samples from the beginning of June were graded by the Methylene Blue Reduction Test which is considered sufficient by the Ministry of Health Officials and had to be accepted by us The results of samples taken from June, 1964 are shown in Table B The Methylene Blue Reduction Test although giving some indication as to the bacteriological condition of the ice cream samples, does not give any indi cation of the type of organisms, and therefore does not help in the identifica ation of the source of the contamination When the new Borough gets its own Laboratory more acceptable sampling will without doubt be undertaken, -31- FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 Registration of Premises The total number of premises registered in accordance with Section 16 of the Pood and Drugs Act 1955, at the end of the year was:- Manufacture;

BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 7 -34- BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vege tables and flowers It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council The Corporation employs a staff of 18 at the market and there are approximately 450 holdings with 142 tenants, On busy days roughly 1,500 vehicles pass through the market. The market is cleansed daily by manual and mechanical sweeping., refuse being removed each day to a controlled tip. There are four sanitary convenience blocks in the market three for men and one for women. Washing facilities with hot and cold water are available in two of the men's blocks and in the women's. The survey of public conveniences in the Borough referred to on page 70 included a review of the public sanitary facilities in the market Improvements were required and a schedule of these was presented to and approved by the Council, and work is now proceeding to provide hot and cold water and electric hand driers in all the conveniences. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation aiiploys the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the Market every six weeks or more often if necessary to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation, Situated in the Market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries,, tinned foods, etc., and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption. -35- HEALTH EDUCATION The importance of never ceasing education of the public in matters of hygiene was high lighted in 1964 when Aberdeen one of the cleanest cities in the country was disgraced by an outbreak of typhoid fever Although the blame for the ori ginal infection has now been allocated to the faulty washing habits of canning factory workers in a foreign country in which corned beef had been tinned and subsequently sent to this country for sale it is clear that the second and third waves of infected cases need not have occurred if perfect hygienehad been main tainedinthe households containing primary cases or in the canteens restaurants or other food establishments where food was handled For years emphasis has been placed on the importance of washing the hands before touching food or food utensils an excellent habit practiced ritually by the Indian members of our community By this means the spread of all in testinal diseases could probably be prevented absolutely yet still at this present time regular hand washing is more notable for its omission than for its performance Facilities for washing the hands are still not readily available in public places and efforts to remedy this continue unceasingly It will be seen that some improvement was obtained in the provision of hand washing facilities in public conveniences during the year but much more needs to be done and under the Food and Drugs Regulations new provisions in restaurants public houses and other places of community association were asked for in 1964 while the new Offices Shops and Railway Premises Act is likely to produce better washing facilities in such places where workers are likely to eat food brought from their homes The principal sources of supply of health education material are the Central Council for Health Education the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the Central Office of Information Projector slides and cinema films are prepared by quite a large number of private companies and Government bodies and sometimes by local authorities direct on important subjects, and these are used from time to time to accompany talks to organisations or to school children Of recent months short health education features have been increasingly presented on B.B.C television at a useful time in the evening when most people have reached their homes and have not yet had to leave for evening engagements In January 1964 the Central Council for Health Education held a Confer ence the subject this year being "Community Health In addition a four day Seminar for Medical Officersof Health was held by the same authority in February on the subject of Occupational Health", During this Seminar visits were arranged to factories with really up to date methods of sanitation for the workers whether on the plant or in the offices. The needs for the most hygienic methods of hand drying and the proper placing of hand basins in sanitary con veniences or in work rooms were discussed A bacteriological investigation of methods of hand drying favours the use of the hot air means for drying or the individual paper towel since even the continuous roller towel using one section for each person could be subject to carelessness in handling At these Seminars it is always possible to learn about the recent advances in health education methods and in addition Medical Officersof Health are able to share informa tion on health education methods as applied in each district This is a very useful interchange of ideas for instance in the previousyear s Seminar a demon stration of the great possibilities of health education in local television circuits when they shall become country wide was fully demonstrated by closed circuit viewing at the actual Conference Local television has yet to come in this neighbourhood 36 WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1964 32 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department These cases are brought to our notice often by persons who feel the old person should be removed compulsorily for his or her own benefit but not everyone knows the extent of the voluntary and statutory aid which can be given to an old person in need and so happily most of the time arrangements of some kind can be made to enable the old person to continue to live in the way which he wants in his own home or by patient persuasion over a long period to get him into a frame of mind which accepts voluntary admission to home or hospital Compulsory removal is a sad and undignified incident in the life of a human being and must be genuinely and fully justified before being used In 1964 no compulsory removal of any old person was carried out Dr Andrews, the Head of the Geriatric Unit at West Middlesex Hospital, has kindly supplied the following report on the needs of the elderly to prevent deterioration, cure sickness and rehabilitate Brentford and Chiswick is one of the four boroughs included in theSouth West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee catchment area for geriatric services With a total population of 446 000 in the area the Unit has 202 beds giving a ratio of 0 45 beds per thousand population although the Ministry of Health recommended figure is 1.2 to 1.4 The results of this gross deficiency of beds in the area are 1 Many ill elderly people die at home before they can be admitted 2 The delay in admitting patients makes their stay in hospital much longer than it need have been At present the Geriatric Department has wards at the West Middlesex Hospital for the acute elderly sick and the rehabilitation of patients suffering mainly from locomotor and neurological diseases besides having wards outside the main hospital for long=stay nursing care cases In addition 350- 400 new patients are seen each year at the out patient sessions held three times a week A special feature of the geriatric service has been the Day Ward for patients which was set up in 1962 Here patients are investigated and treated both from the general medical and locomotor angles who need considerably more attention than could be provided in Out-Patients and yet do not need a 24 hour "hotel service" which is often psychologically disturbing for elderly people and should not occur unless it is absolutely essential Unnecessary admissions of course are wasteful as regards manpower and costs Last year 255 new patients attended the Day Ward which is open five days a week An attempt has been made with the services mentioned above to give a wide range of hospital treatment for elderly people The scope of local authority responsibility can and should expand over an even wider range The two most urgent community needs are (i) For day centres to be established which besides taking elderly people direct from their homes would act as holding units" for handicappedpatients discharged from respital who need care through the day and psychological stimulation to keep them active both mentally and physically Diversional therapy should be organised preferably by a trained occupational therapist but the day to day work could be carried out by voluntary or untrained personnel 37- (ii) That domiciliary services must not break down at week-ends and holidays, It was even seriously suggested to me recently that patients should be admitted to hospital for the Christmas period as they cannot be maintained at home This criticism refers particularly to the otherwise excellent Home Help and Meals on Wheels services. In general the coming into operation of the new Greater London Council Boroughs will present a great opportunity for the co-operation of preventive health and hospital services However, it is most important that: (a) Hospital beds should be reserved for patients who are medically ill or need heavy nursing care, (b) Local authority welfare homes should be reserved for the severely handicapped who are only partially independent. (c) Modified housing schemes with wardens attached shouldbe reserved for the more independent who need only minimal supervision Authorities at present often cater for a type of person who is physically and mentally healthier than those for whom the need is greatest. The fact that the Greater London Council Boroughs will cover domiciliary health, welfare and housing services provides the chance to create schemes in which the provisions for the elderly are much more properly balanced5' Details of the 32 cases alleged to be in need of care and attention are as follows: Removed to Hospital 5 Removed to Old People's Home 1 Left district,, obtained other housing 1 Remained at home - (a) meals on wheels and home help provided 1 (b) meals on wheels and bedding provided 1 (c) meals and home help provided - awaiting housing 1 (d) meals and fuel provided 1 (e) meals, fuel and home help provided 1 (f) meals, fuel and bedding provided 1 (g) meals, home help and laundry provided 1 (h) meals provided and housing obtained 1 (i) meals and registration as Blind person 1 (j) home help only provided 2 (k) home help and telephone provided 1 (1) home help and coal provided -

This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are other clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members,, for social and recreational purposes Brentford Old Polks social Club This club meets every Wednesday 1.30 p.m-5 p.m. and has 140 members. The meetings are social with periodic visiting entertainers There were five free outings in 1964, two annual parties, and almost every week a free tea. Old Age Pensions Association (Brentford Branch) The membership of this Club is over 102, with an average attendance of 86 at the weekly meeting which is of a social nature with occasional Concert Parties, In 1964, a free day's outing to the coast was arranged, and four half day trips, two theatre parties a Birthday party and a Christmas party The Association runs a penny a week club for sickness Old Age Pensions Association (Chiswick Branch) This association has a membership of 130 and meets weekly for social purposes A free annual outing and Christmas Tea Party are held, and in 1964 additional outings were arranged and paid for by the members of the Association themselves Members of the Club paid visits to any of the others who had cause to be absent through sickness Other Societies Several of the societies whose functions are classified elsewhere In this report contribute to a very considerable extent to the Welfare of the Elderly, i.e. the British Red Cross Association, the St, John Ambulance Brigade, the Blind Club, the Club for the.Hard of Hearing, the two Philanthropic Societies and the Chiswick Mission The Brentford Philanthropic Society owns a home "Scott Lodge' containing flatlets for eleven elderly persons with some community service, and now is in progress of planning an extension to provide an additional nine flatlets The Chiswick Mission owns two houses which are let to aged persons - the number of tenants is eight, and the tenants, each of whom has one room, pay a small nominal rent Money is available for relief of distress, provided from the Brentford and Chiswick Sick Poor Persons Fund During 1964, fifteen persons were given assistance by provision of coal, clothing, etc Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at reduced rates (Id per bath with soap and towel) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments, 2,520 baths were taken in Chiswick and 1,555 in Brentford. -40- Meals on wheels The Meals on Wheels Service for the elderly housebound through sickness continued to expand during 1964 293 persons were recommended for and obtained,, this service, whereby meals are delivered to the homes on five days a week, The food is cooked at Acton Municipal Kitchen and is delivered in hot containers in four specially equipped vans, one of which was given by the members of the Brentford and Chiswick Round Table the other three being purchasedby the Welfare Organisation which later became the Borough Council Welfare Sub-Committee,, The fourth van was provided in 1964 because of the heavy demand on the three vans already in operation The number of meals delivered during the year was 37 652 compared with 31 203 in 1963 26 874 in 1962 and the number of people helped with this service was 293 in 1964 compared with 238 in 1963 and 204 in 1962 A special arrangement was made whereby at Christmas when the Meals Service was not in operation a frozen Christmas dinner was suppliedto any recipient of daily meals who would not otherwise obtain a meal on that day. Only 50 of these were needed, however,, as good neighbours or relations were willing and indeed axnious to give help at this special season Of the 209 people on the active meals list at the endofthe year 119 had been requested by private practitioners, 28 by hospital almoners,, 44 by the local Home Help Organiser 8 by Welfare Officers and 10 were requested from other sources, ie Old Polks Fund Secretary Health Visitors, Home Nurse, or relations As the Meals Service is at present only available to old age pensioners living alone and housebound through illness, it is more a serviceof rehabilitation and treatment than one of prevention and it is necessary to have medical grounds for providing the meals To make the service truly preventive, meals should be available for anyone elderly and living alone as the desire to cook and take well balanced meals tends to fade under these circumstances, and malnutrition gradually develops An analysis of the disabilities of the 209 people on the active meals list at the end of the year gave the following results, Bronchitis 13 Pernicious anaemia 1 Post operative debility 9 Arterio sclerosis 4 Malnutrition 40 Gastric ulcers 2 Arthritis 46 Diabetes 3 Blindness 12 Cancer 2 Stroke and paralysis 20 Amputation of leg 1 Heart disease 23 Mental illness 1 Varicose ulcers 5 Parkinson s disease 1 Injuries and fractures 10 Hernia 1 Hypertension 8 Disseminated sclerosis 2 Phlebitis 3 Progressive muscular atrophy 1 Tuberculosis 1 The oldest lady receiving the service is said to be 99 years of age. Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged, was carried on throughout the year Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources, then arrangements were made for the Departments van to call each weekto collect the soiled linen deliver it to the laundry, and to transport the clean linen -41- back again to the home of the old person No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee. During the year fourteen old persons had been recommended for, and obtained this service Holidays for the Elderly In May 1964. 40 elderly persons were provided (by the Brentford and chiswick Town Council) with a free holiday for one week , and in September, 1964, 40 more people were sent on a half cost holiday. Holiday for elderly persons were also provided by other local organisations, viz; the two Philanthropic Societies and Chiswick Mission WELFARE - GENERAL Home Safety The Sub-Committee for Home Safety met during the year several times and various projects were considered and topical items discussed It was decided that a fee would be paid for notification of home accidents by doctors, whether in private or hospital practice, and the medical practitioners and the authorities of the hospitals serving this area were notified accordingly The fee was to be the same as the statutory fee for notification of infectious diseases with, however, no backing of legal penalties for failure to notify, The response, however, was not good and the only indication of the types of home accident occurring are still obtainable only from the deaths figures, which although fortunately remaining low show only a very tiny proportion of persons having such accidents Accidents in the home may, although not causing fatal results, mean the life-long disability physical or mental, of the injured persons The hospital authorities of West Middlesex Hospital made a considerable effort to try to help us to obtain statistics on past home accidents treated in the hospital, but the amount of clerical work involved both for hospital and departmental staff was too vast There is no doubt that some scheme of correlation of the occurrence of home accidents can be undertaken as a piece of research and this should be done early in the life of the new authority as home accidents are the cause of much unnecessary suffering, and even in the cold light of finance, cost the nation enormous sums in treatment During the year, the Children s Nightdresses Regulations 1964 were made by the Secretary of State under the powers conferred on him in Section 1 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961 and came into force on 1st October, 1964 In these Regulations, it became an offence to sell children's nightdresses which were not made of flame proof material The Sub-Committee arranged a film evening in March at which several films on Home Safety subjects were shown to representatives of voluntary organisations of the Borough and some representatives of statutory bodies This evening was well attended and requests were made from two of the organisations for private showings of the films to be made at their Club meetings, These two showings were arranged and paid for by the Borough Council In one of the films a fire detection system was demonstrated and enquiries revealed that a similar system was available in this country Details of this 42 fire detection system were brought to the attention of the Old People's Walfare Sub-Committee and the Housing Committee as Old People s flatlets in a converted building in Sutton Court Road, Chiswick were a project of these Committees It was decided that a fire detection system would be standard equipment in this type of property in the future and would be installed both in the Sutton Court Road flatlets and the Walnut Tree Road South scheme under consideration The Home Safety Sub-Committee also decided to invite the participation of the children in the local schools in a poster and poetry competition on Home Safety subjects The schools were circulated and the decision was made that the competition should be held early in 1965 Other matters receiving earnest attention from the Committee members were the safety of gas and electric cookers the need for the special marking of large plate glass doors which can cause injury because of not being visible to shortsighted or careless persons, water safety the dangers of plastic bags if too readily available to young children,, and the need for domestic fire extinguishers to be sufficiently small, cheap and effective to be readily purchased for every home The Public Duty Officer of the St John Ambulance Brigade and the Divisional Director of the British Red Cross Society

The percentage of children having milk in schools is as follows:- 1964 1963 1962 Primary 89.2 % 98.0 % 98.6 % Secondary 63.8 % 71.3 % 75.3 % Grammar 53.8 % 52.5 % 58.4% The percentage of meals served to daily attendances:- -47- January to December 1964 % of Attendance taking meals Average number taking meals Average attendance Primary Schools Belmont Junior Mixed 68.4 117 171 Belmont Infants' 70.0 70 100 Beverley Road Infants' 89 7 140 156 Cavendish J M. & Infants' 66.6 120 180 Ealing Road J.M, & Infants' 73.6 296 402 Grove Park J M. & Infants' 62.3 129 207 Hogarth Junior Mixed 68. 2 189 274 Hogarth Infants" 50. 0 56 112 Lionel Road J.M. & Infants' 80.1 213 266 St. George's J.M. & Infants' 44.4' 40 90 St. John's R.C., J.M, & Infants' 76.4' 194 254 St. Lawrence with St. Paul's J.M. & Infants' 58.8 100 170 Strand-on-the-Green J.M. 83.3 165 198 Strand-on-the-Green Infants' 68.9 129 187 St Mary's J.M. & Infants' (Autumn Term only) 96.7 235 243 Secondary Schools Brentford Boys' 49.8 128 257 Brentford Girls' 50. 0 145 290 Staveley Boys' 61 7 269 436 Staveley Girls' 62.0 225 363 Chiswick Grammar Boys' 46.7 234 501 Chiswick Grammar Girls' 68.5 306 447 Gunnersbury Catholic Grammar 71. 7 287 400 There was a satisfactory increase in the numbers of children taking school meals A curious thing noted from the figures from which the school milk percentages were calculated was that while the number of girls at the Chiswick Grammar School remained absolutely unchanged through the whole year, in the Chiswick Boys' Grammar School, the number of milk drinkers gradually rose by 50% from January till October, then began to fall once more. Althoughmore milk was drunk in total, it can be seen that the percentage of children taking the milk was a good deal less, particularly in the primary schools. Calcium deficiency is now a national problem, so efforts to improve the consumption of milk in all the schools require to be made. -48- ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Three stations were in operation throughout the year for the estimation by the volumetric method of the amount of smoke and sulphur dioxide present in the atmosphere except that the Staveley Road station was out of commission for part of the month of March and the whole of the month of April due to a break down of apparatus The Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was supplied monthly with details of the readings ob tained for inclusion in the National survey of atmospheric pollution, Table XV on page 89 gives a summary of the year s recordings, and the monthly averages have been set out in graph form as Graph "C" This shows little change from the pattern of previous years and a comparison is made in Graphs "E" and "F" with the readings for smoke and sulphur dioxide obtained in the Borough ten years ago. Although no appreciable improvement is shown by this comparison one wonders what the results would have been if all the work of recent years for the promotion of clean air had not been carried out No periods of “smog” such as those occurring in 1962 and 1952 were exper ienced during the year. The average monthly concentrations of smoke measured at the three stations in the Borough are compared in Graph D on page 53 with those of Leeds Central London and Lerwick Leeds has been chosen to represent an industrial area s smoke production while Lerwick is a virtually smokeless area It is regretted that at the time of printing figures for Lerwick for the whole of the year were not available and the graph in this case has been completed by estimation based on previous years recordings Clean Air Act 19 56 During the year 72 complaints were received concerning alleged smoke grit, dust and smut nuisances These included the burning of vehicle interior furnish ings bonfires smoke and smuts from chimneys and an incinerator Upon in vestigation and where cause for complaint was confirmed remedial measures were taken and these sometimes resulted in the inspection and overhaul of offending appliances by the manufacturers A close watch has also been kept on any pre mises which are liable to cause atmospheric pollution periodically, A total of 131 visits revisits or observations were made during the year for all of these purposes Alleged nuisances from bonfires continue to be reported to the Department but no action has been possible in many cases as the bonfire either was not causing a nuisance or it had been put out before a visit could be made Now that smokeless fuels are being more widely used as the smoke control areas progress many residents complain to the Department of smoke from bonfires on a misapprehension that these are prohibited under the Clean Air Act 1956, A bonfire must be causing nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood before it can be deemed to be a statutory nuisance The advice of the Officers has been sought concerning the height of new chimneys to be erected at business or industrial premises in the area. Seven such cases were dealt with during the year The Officers of the Department have sought advice from the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research concerning the heights of chimney stacks for the lower capacity oil fired, air heating units now being installed, particularly in factory premises as the rating of these appliances is generally lower than those dealt with in the Memorandum on Chimney Heights issued by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government It was suggested that factory owners should be encouraged to install chimneys of such a height as to clear the ridge of the nearest build ing. 49 The help of the Warren Spring Laboratory staff on the problems submitted to them has been much appreciated. Notices of proposals to install new furnaces at business or industrial premises in the area were received in respect of two appliances using town gas and seven oil fired appliances Work has continued throughout the year on the establishment of further Smoke Control Areas and details of this work are as follows The Borough s No 4 Smoke Control Order made by the Council on the 25th April 1963 and confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 6th August 1963 came into operation on the 1st July 1964 Applications for “approval to works” were few in the initial weeks but the position improved in the autumn when occupiers of dwellings became conscious of the approaching winter and their heating requirements. There was the usual significant proportion of occupiers who delayed their applications to within a day or two of the operative date of the Order and these together with applications made after the operative date resulted in 71 Statutory Notices being served under Section 12(2) of the Clean Air Act 1956 The Borough s No 5 Smoke Control Order was made by the Council on the 29th January 1964 and confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 8th July 1964. The operative date is the 1st July 1965 The areaisthat part of the Borough bounded on the north by Chiswick High Road (south side) from Town Hall Avenue to the west side of Devonshire Road, on the east southwards along the west side of Devonshire Road to the roundabout on the Great West Road on the south westwards along the north side of the Great West Road (Hogarth Lane and Ellesmere Road) to the roundabout at the junction of Sutton Court Road and on the west, northwards along the east side of Sutton Court Road across Heathfield Terrace and along the east side of Town Hall Avenue to its junction with Chiswick High Road The area covers 108 acres and comprises 1, 317 private and 376 Council owned dwellings Within the area there are also 8 industrial 88 commercial and 22 miscellaneous premises The Borough s No 6 Smoke Control Order was made by the Council on the 26th November 1964 and is awaiting confirmation by the Minister of Housing and Local Government The area covers 108 acres and comprises 1, 408 private and 101 Council owned dwellings. Within the area there are also 3 industrial, 54 commercial and 8 miscellaneous premises The total estimated cost of adaptations eligible for grant is £9 100 and the proposed date of operation of the Order is the 1st November 1965 The area is that part of the Borough bounded on the east by the west side of Town Hall Avenue across Heathfield Terrace southward along the west side of Sutton Court Road to the Great West Road north side (Cedars Road) on the south by the north side of the Great West Road to the Chiswick roundabout at its junction with the south side of Chiswick High Road on the north by the south side of Chiswick High Road from its junction with the Chiswick roundabout to the west side of Town Hall Avenue The survey of the Borough s No 7 Smoke Control Area has been commenced and will probably be completed in March 1965, 50 The total number of visits and revisits made during the year in connection with Smoke Control Areas was 2 213, In addition, 3 884 communications to

increases were on rat infestation duties, inspection of nuisances caused by faulty drains and sewers, and reinspection of the works carried out to improve these, review of premises where food is handled and visits to elderly people in need of assistance with sanitary problems Visits for all these purposes have been increasing rapidly during recent years, and new duties have been added with the coming into operation of the Offices Shops and Railway Premises Act The real emergency visits for enquiries into epi demic disease and food poisoning to which all other visits would have to give way have fortunately not been large for some years The last considerable 56 figure was in 1960 and even that which was due to a Sonne dysentery outbreak was not great enough to stop normal working in any way, as the disease was rapidly contained and soon eliminated Action taken other than Housing Act 1957 Number of Cautionary or Intimation Notices served 395 Number of Statutory Notices issued

1 57 All premises in the Borough are provided with water closets and all drain into sewers with the exception of four i e two boathouses Kew Bridge Station and Carville Hall Brentford which are at present some distance from the nearest sewer and where cesspools or septic tanks are in use There is also a small number of catchpits for industrial wastes at indus trial premises in the area now amounting to seven Arrangements for the regular clearing of these cesspools and catchpits are made with the Borough Engineer s Department of the Council Enquiries Outstanding Sanitary Notices During the year 1 218 enquiries were received from other Departments enquiring if any sanitary notices were outstanding in respect of certain properties in the district The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICES The water supply for the whole of the district is supplied by the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board One well which is still in use in the Borough (at Green s Boathouse Riverside Lands) is used for washing purposes only while drinking water is obtained direct from the mains Prom time to time reports are issued by the Metropolitan Water Board on samples of water examined chemically bacteriologically biologically and for tasting purposes The samples are taken at various stages ranging from river water to water before and after filtration and to water before and after chlorination This constant checking ensures that the quality of the water entering the mains is satisfactory at all times The quantity of the water supply too has been satisfactory throughout the year Watch is also kept by the Board on the discharge of any radioactive effluents into waters which contribute eventually to the supplies they are treating to ensure that the standards laid down are complied with SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The sewerage system for Brentford and Chiswick is mainly a separate system in which surface water drainage and foul drainage are kept separate with two sets of drains along streets to which the various connections can be made, In a few of the older areas of the Borough no surface water drainage exists and in these areas the foul and surface water drainage from properties is all taken into the foul sewer while surface water drainage from highways is taken into soakaways The surface water drainage system is split into areas throu^iout the Borough and each area has an outfall into the River Thames There are approximately 18 outfalls of this kind along the length of the River within the Borough The foul drainage system is based on the two areas of Brentford and Chiswick each area draining to one point within its boundary The Brentford area drains to Town Meadow Depot and the Chiswick area to Corney Road Depot Before the advent of the West Middlesex Drainage Board the sewage received at Town Meadow Depot was pumped to a sewage disposal plant situated at Clayponds Gardens and the sewage received at Corney Road Depot was treated at a plant within the Depot both plants having outfalls into the Thames for effluent Since the West Mid dlesex Drainage Board came into operation the two sewage plants in the Borough 58 have ceased to operate and the two Depots were connected to a trunk sewer owned by the Board and running through the Borough, The sewage from the Borough is carried by the trunk sewer to Mogden Works and treated and disposed of there It must be noted that the drainage system joins the trunk sewer in only two places The sewerage system of the Borough is in general considered to be suffi cient to cope with the present and any likely future flows which may result from new development REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of by collecting freighters to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough, SCHOOL SANITATION The following information on work carried out during 1964 to improve the sanitation in

Of these 140 houses were included in the High Street Redevelopment Area and the Walnut Tree Road Redevelopment Area and their inspection would probably be delayed until redevelopment was imminent. This, together with the impending absorption of Brentford and Chiswick into the new London Borough of Hounslow has resulted in a slowing down in the rate of progress maintained in previous years. It is hoped that the proposed redevelopment of Brentford, plans for which are now under discussion and which will embrace a much greater area than was originally anti cipated will not be too long delayed so benefitting those families which are still awaiting rehousing and at the same time giving them a more pleasing pro spect than the gas works and the dilapidated High Street. The work of rehousing the occupants of unfit houses has continued and the demolition of houses in clearance areas and unfit houses elsewhere has again 60 progressed Details of the year s work and the position at the end of the year are set out below Albany Road No 6 Compulsory Hirchase Order, 1957 Nos. 19 - 25 (odd numbers) Albany Road, Brentford) Nos. 29 - 37 (odd numbers) Albany Road, Brentford) (Demolished 1960) Nos. 280 289 (consecutive numbers) High Street; Brentford, One family still remained to be rehoused from the High Street properties at the end of the year.

Overcrowding is relieved in various ways, by private arrangements made by the families concerned by Council rehousing, or by Council nomination under the Industrial Selection Scheme for housing in New Towns DISINFECTION Premises disinfected Ordinary notifiable diseases 12 Tuberculosis 1 Premises treated for vermin 38 Premises treated for other pests (Wasps, moths, ants and beetles etc.) 48 67  Houses Flats Maisonettes Bungalows Total By Private Enterprise (a) Rebuilds 116 135 15 2 268 (b) New 69 224 23 3 319 TOTAL 587 Temporary Housing Houses Flats Maisonettes Bunga1ows Total By Borough Council (a) Rebuilds – – – – – (b) New – – – 150 150 TOTAL 150 Routine disinfection of blankets bedding etc was carried out on the premises in the above table as required In addition articles of clothing and bedding parcelsof clothing destined for countries abroad and when necessary books for both public and private libraries were disinfected on the Public Health Department premises An arrangement is in force whereby the South West MiddlesexHospital Manage ment Committee undertakes to carry out emergency disinfection of smallpox infected clothing and bedding on demand 68 MISCELLANEOUS RODENT CONTROL During the year 1 741 primary visits and re visits were made by the Rodent Operatives to premises in the district in connection with rodent disinfestation. The number of premises where treatment was carried out is as follows:- Private Houses 425 Factories 23 Shops 22 Schools 8 Parks and Open Spaces 4 None of these infestations were severe enough to be classed as major infest ations It was necessary to devise an alternative method of sewer maintenance in 1964 because of the unsatisfactory nature of the results obtained by the former method whereby as outlined by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, bait was lowered andlefton ledges slightly above the water level This level, however fluctuates in Brentford and Chiswick sewers sufficiently to swamp the bait often; and it was decided to use bait contained in polythene bags and sus pended in the manholes thus keeping it from being swept away, and also preventing rotting The method proved very successful. Also, instead of 10% sampling of manholes, block treatment of every manhole in defined areas was introduced. Analyses of the results are as follows No of manholes baited No. of takes (in period between 1week and six weeks) Area 1 April June 1964 Soil sewers 85 44 Surface Water Sewers 24 8 Area 2 October November. 1964 Soil sewers 105 15 Surface Water Sewers 18 4 Area 3 November December 1964 Soil sewers 75 53 Surface Water Sewers 51 11 Area 4 December 1964 Soil sewers 81 11 Surface Water Sewers 66 15 In these first four area schemes over one third of the Borough acreage is included The work of Rodent Control is carried out under the supervision of the Chief Public Health Inspector by two Rodent Operatives PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act for the regulation of the sale of pet animals requires all premises in which animals are sold for pets to be licensed by the local authority.

There are 8 street conveniences, 19 in public parks and open spaces and 4 in Brentford Market The general condition and state of cleanliness varied from reasonably good to excellent in all except two one of these being due for demolition in the near future and the other being one of the Market conveniences. Facilities for washing the hands were by no means so good, however, only in three instances was hot water provided in some not even cold water was available and the de ficiencies having been reported to the Public Health Committee, action was requested by the three other Committees concerned. By the end of the year improvements had been promised by the Market Committee (see page 35) During the year 1964, 90 600 paper towels, (52,700 in Brentford 37.900 in Chiswick), were issued The comparative figures for 1963 were 51.400 paper towels issued (34 000 in Brentford 17 400 in Chiswick), showing a greatly in creased use of these facilities, only a small part of which was due to the discontinuation of the issue of linen towels for a small charge A new convenience, in the Court House area of Brentford was completed and opened to the Public in April 1964, Free paper towels and liquid soap were provided. RIVER POLLUTION No reports have been received from the Middlesex County Council on sampling of water from the River Brent during 1964, but observation has been kept on the stream and there has been no evidence of any accidental pollution of the river nor has it been found necessary to take action during the year against any person using the River Brent for unauthorised discharge of sewage or trade effluents STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district have been allocated for streettrading purposes There were 22 Street Trading sites and during 1964 11 visits were paid to these sites to verify hygienic conditions 32 hawkers of food were registered with the Council, 70 CANAL BOATS Number of boats on register:- Motor propelled boats 89 Other boats 406 MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF COUNCIL STAFF The following medical examinations of Council staff were carried out during 1964 No. of examinations for entry into the Superannuation Scheme 56 No, of examinations following expiration of sick leave 14 NUCLEAR RADIATION Regular reports have been received from the Metropolitan Water Board indicating the amount of radio active effluent ascertained in the sources of the water drunk locally, During 1964, all discharges from the Atomic Energy Authorties were monitored and declared satisfactory A register is now being maintained of those industrial concerns permitted to make use of radio active material on their premises, with special reference to maximum permitted quantities, nature of radio-active element, and method of disposal OFFENSIVE SMELLS Prom time to time complaints of offensive smells require investigation, the source of the smell sought and treated, whether it is an offensive accumulation or faulty sanitation.
