In November, 1882. the said drainage works were accordingly carried out by the Vestry in Red riff-road, Plaistow, at a total cost of £142 0s. 7d. The leaseholders of the eight houses erected upon the said Charity Estate have paid to the Vestry their apportionments of the cost of such drainage, amounting to £27 12s. 0d. The Vestry have advertised for proposals for letting the vacant land at Plaistow, at low ground rents, for a term of 80 years, either as a whole or in plots of two or more, but up to the present time no satisfactory offer for the same has been received. 22 The Vestry in conjunction with the authorities of the several other parishes interested in Henry Smith's Charity Estate, had under consideration an application made bv the Trustees of the Charity to the Charity Commissioners, for authority to effect an exchange of certain land belonging to the said Charity at Reigate, for other land belonging to Mr. John Clutton. The Vestry appointed the two Churchwardens (Messrs. William Canham and Robert Foottit), and Messrs. Ralph Westall Walker, and Reuben Henry Williams, Junr, as delegates on behalf of this parish, to attend a conference of delegates of the different parishes interested in the Charity, upon the subject of the proposed exchange of land. A meeting of the delegates of the various parishes was accordingly held on the 24th July, 1882, when it was — " Resolved, that this meeting having been convened to hear Mr. Clutton upon his " proposal for an exchange of his land for land belonging to Smith's Charity Estate, " and this meeting having heard Mr. Clutton's explanation upon the subject, is satisfied " that the proposed exchange would be prejudical to the poor belonging to the various " parishes interested in the charity, and object to any such exchange taking place." The Vestry also recommended to the Charity Commissioners their disapproval of the proposed exchange of the charity land with Mr. Clutton, and ultimately, in January, 1883, a communication was received from the Charity Commissioners, to the effect that the Trustees of Henry Smith's Charity had withdrawn their application for authority for the said proposed exchange of land. Baths and Wash-houses. The Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses having on the 25th April, 1882, represented to the Vestry, that on an inquiry held by the Inspector of the Local Government Board, on the 17th April, 1882, upon the application of the Commissioners to borrow £2,500, as sanctioned by the Vestry on the 7th March. 1882, the Inspector after going into the accounts and the requirements for the purpose of carrying out effectually the work of the Baths and Wash-houses, recommended that the Commissioners should borrow £3000 for such purpose, in lieu of £2,500, which he thought would not be sufficient for the work necessary to be executed, viz. : for putting up additional apparatus in the Wash-house and for fittings and furniture. It was thereupon " Resolved, that this Vestry hereby sanction the Commissioners for Public Baths "and Wash-houses in this parish borrowing at interest the sum of £3,000 (in lieu of "£2,500) on the security of a mortgage of the rates for the relief of the poor of this " parish, such sum of £3,000 to be applied for the purposes of the Act, to encourage " the establishment of Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the several Acts amending " the same." In July, 1882, the Commissioners obtained a loan of £3,000 for the purposes before mentioned, from the Metropolitan Board of Works, to be repaid by twenty-nine annual instalments with interest at the rate of £3 10s. Od. per annum. 23 At a meeting of the Vestry held on the 7th of November, 1882, Messrs. Ralph Walker and Thomas William Clarke were elected Commissioners for Public Hat lis atid Wash-houses, (in the place of Messrs. Daniel Serle and Thomas William Clarke, who retired by rotation), to act in conjunction with Messrs. John Bulmer, Edward James Talbot, Francis John Bislcy, Lawrence Stevens and Edward John Cox the continuing Commissioners. Street Improvements. Upon the taking down of an old building, No. 204 on the south side of Rotherhithe-street, belonging to Messrs. Hallett and Fry, the Vestry resolved to take steps for widening the street at that spot, and a building, No. 151 on the north side of the street opposite the before mentioned premises, having been burnt down, the Vestry also determined to purchase a small slip of land, a portion of the site for the improvement of the line of street there. Plans for the said improvements were, by order of the Vestry, submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and being approved by that Board, negotiations were entered into with the freeholders and leaseholders of the properties of which portions were required for effecting the improvements, and ultimately the following terms were arranged, viz. :— Messrs. Lucretia Bush and others, for the freehold ot the portions of the sites of No. 204 on the south side and No 151 on the north side of Rotherhithe street £175 0 0 Messsrs. Hallett and Fry, for their leasehold interest in the portions of No. 204 and 151 Rotherhithe-street aforesaid 300 0 0 Total £475 0 0 The Metropolitan Board of Works, on the application of the Vestry, agreed to contribute towards the cost of the improvement, such contribution not to exceed the sum of £237, and to be paid to the Vestry upon the certificate by the Board s Architect of the completion of the work. The purchase of the sites have been completed and the improvements is course of being carried out. Wards The Vestry having received a notice dated 27th Decemlier, 1882, from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works, as to the proposed division of this pari*!) into three Wards and increasing the number of Vestrymen to 72, stating that the Board would meet on Fridav. the 12th of January, 1883, at one o'clock in the afternoon, at the office in Spring Gardens. Charing Cross, to further consider the matter, and that any person could attend at the time and place aforesaid, in support of, or in opposition to, the proposed division of the Parish into Wards. 24 On the 9th January, 1883, the Vestry passed the following resolutions upon the subject, viz. :— "Resolved, that a Memorial be presented by this Vestry to the Metropolitan "Board of Works, praying that in the proposed order for the division of the parish "into Wards, the number of Vestrymen to be apportioned between the three Wards be 36 instead of 72, if that number can be legally appointed, but if not, then that the " Metropolitan Board of Works be requested to refrain from further proceeding with " the matter, until it be seen how the Bill proposed to be brought in, in the next " session of Parliament, will affect the Vestry, and that a deputation of the Vestry ' attend the Board on Friday next, in support of such Memorial." " Resolved, that the deputation consist of the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, Rector, "the Chairman, and Messrs. John Bulmer, Henry Lovel Bartlett, Francis John Bislev, " George Mabbs, and Robert Foottit." The deputation with the Clerk accordingly attended the meeting of the Metropolitan Board of Works, on tho 12th of January, 1883, and presented to the Board a Memorial as follows:- To the Honorable the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Memorial of the Vestry of the parish of Rotherhithe, in county of Surrey. Sheweth, That with regard to the proposed division of the parish of Rotherhithe into Wards, and to the resolution of your Honorable Board that the said parish shall be divided into three Wards, and that the number of Vestrymen to be elected in respect of such three Wards shall be 72, your Memorialists, whilst agreeing in the desirability of dividing the said parish into three Wards and approving of the extent, limits, and boundarv lines of such wards, as settled by your Honorable Board, are of opinion that the total number of Vestrymen to be appointed in respect of such three wards should not exceed 36, and that for many reasons it will he to the disadvantage of the parish, if the number of Vestrvmen to be elected be more than that number. Your Memorialists are further of opinion that if your Honorable Board feel legally bound by the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, to fix the number of Vestrymen to be elected at 72, then that the further consideration of the whole matter should be postponed until it be seen how far the Vestrv will be affected by the Bill for the better government of the Metropolis, which Her Majesty's Government propose to bring on for consideration in the next session of Parliament. Your Memorialists therefore pray your Honorable Board to make an order dividing the said parish into three Wards, and fixing the total number of Vestrymen in respect of such three Wards at 36 ; or, in the alternative, to postpone making any order in the matter until Parliament has dealt with the Bill for the better management of the Metropolis, which the Government is pledged to bring in, in the ensuing session. And your Memorialists will ever prav, &c. The Common Seal of the Vestry of the parish of Rotherhithe (l.s.) was affixed hereto bv order of the Vestrv dated the 9th day of January, 1883. Signed, JAMES JOHN STOKES, Clerk to the Vettry. 25 The Metropolitan Board of Works thereupon referred the subject to its Works and General Purposes Committee for further consideration and report, and no further steps have as yet been taken in the matter. Electric Lighting. In September 1882, the Vestry received notice under the provisions of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, of intention to apply for provisional orders for power to supply electricity for lighting certain streets in this parish, from the following companies, viz.:— The Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company (Limited). The Gulcher Klectric Light and Power Company (Limited). The Edison Electric Lighting Company (Limited). The Swan United Electric Light Company (Limited). Messrs. Ferranti, Thompson and Ince (Limited). On the 3rd October, 1882, the Vestrv appointed a Special Committee consisting of the following Vestrymen, viz.: Messrs. Ralph Westall Walker, Henry Lovel Bartlett, James Wilson, Henry Hayward, John Bulmer, Francis John Bisley, Robert Foottit, Martin Deavin, and William Canbatn, to consider and report upon the schemes of the before mentioned Electric Lighting Companies. The Committee on the 17th October, 1882, reported to the Vestry the receipt of a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Camberwell, inviting a deputation of three members from each of the Vestries and District Boards of South London, to attend a Conference at the Vestry Hall, Camberwell, on the 31st of October, 1882, on the subject of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, and the notices received from several Electric Lighting Companies, and recommended that three delegates be appointed by the Vestry to represent this parish at the said proposed conference. The Vestrv adopted the recommendation of the Committtee and appointed Messrs Robert Foottit, John Bulmer, and James Wilson as delegates from this Vestry, to attend such conference. On the 21st November, 1882, the Electric Lighting Committee reported to the Vestry that the delegates appointed attended the conference of delegates from South London Vestries and District Boards, at the Vestry Hall, Camberwell, at which it was " Resolved, that it having been reported to the various Vestries and District " Boards that, inasmuch as the provisions of the Electric Lighting Act require the " Lolcal Authority to elect before the 25th January, 1883, either to apply for Licenses " themselves, or Permit the undertakers to apply for provisional orders, and inasmuch " as the President of the Board of Trade has declared that the Act of Parliament " must be carried out, in the opinion of this Conference the local authorities should be " advited to apply for licenses, so as to keep the power in their ow n hands On the 5th December, 1882, a plan and notice was received by the Vestry, that application was intruded to lie made by the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company ( Limited) to the Board of Trade, on or before the 21st December, 1882, for a provisional order for the purposes mentioned in the notice. 26 On the 9th January, 1883, a Special Meeting of the Vestrv was held, after one month's notice to that effect, for the purpose of determining whether the Vestry would apply to the Hoard of Trade for a license to supply the electric light for public and private purposes in the parish, or whether they would consent to a license or provisional order to some or one of the Electric Light Companies who had served notices, or what steps, if any, they would take in the matter, when it was— " Resolved, that this Vestry do not at present apply the Board of Trade for a " license to supply the electric light for public or private purposes in this parish, and " that the Vestrv oppose the granting of the provisional order, a draft of which has " been deposited by the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company " (Limited), in order to obtain the insertion of the necessary clauses in such provisional " order, to secure the rights of the Vestrv as the local authority under the Electric " Lighting Act, 18S2, and for the protection of the interests of the parish." On the "29th January, 1883, the Vestry forwarded to the Board of Trade, clauses for insertion in the provisional order applied for by the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company (Limited), for the protection of the interests of this parish. The matter is still under the consideration of the Board of Trade. The several other Companies who gave notice to the Vestry of their intention to apply for provisional orders for the supply of electricity in this parish, did not proceed with their schemes. Miscellaneous. The Vestry have agreed to pay the Guardians of St. Olave's Union the sum of £5 per annum, for the expenses of warming and lighting the Board-room of the Workhouse, Deptford Lower-road, for the meetings of the Vestry, the pavment to become due at Lady-day in each year. The Vestry having received communications from the Vestries of the parishes of Lambeth and Newington, on the subject of Water Companies Charges, on the 6th June, 1882, passed the following resolution, viz.: — " Resolved, that the Vestry approve of the views expressed in the following reso" lutions passed by the Vestry of Lambeth* and approved by the Vestry of Newington, " viz.: That in the opinion of this Vestry an Act of Parliament should be obtained, " restricting the Water Companies of London from charging the gross value as the "annual value upon which they base their charges. And from making their rates " upon an extra assessment, where the house or property remains structurally the same. " And that the Vestries of Lambeth and Newington be informed that this Vestrv will " support such a measure at the proper time." On the 18th April, 1882, the Vestry passed the following resolution, viz.:— 27 " Resolved, that in view of the introduction of some change in the Municipal "Government of the Metropolis, this Vestry is of opinion that no change in the " present svstem will be satisfactory or desirable, which does not admit of the retention " bv the ratepayers of full control over their local affairs. Upon the application of Messrs. Hames and Darling, the Metropolitan Board of Works, in October, 1882, approved of the formation of the extension of Eugenia-road into Oldfield-road, and of the name " Eugenia-road, S.E., in continuation of the same. The Vestry having received notices from the Metropolitan Board of Works under the Thames Prevention of Floods Act, for the raising and alterations to several plving stairs and rights of way to the river in this parish, the necessary works were accordlingly carried out in July 1882, under the direction of the Surveyor of Sewers to the Vestry. In June 1882, the Metropolitan Board of Works made the their formal order for the renumbering of the houses in Plough-road and abolishing the subsidiary names therein, and such renumbering has been carried out accordingly. The Vestry having had under consideration a letter received from the Guardians of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, together with an accompanying extract from a report of their Workhouse and Infirmary Visiting Committee, as to the necessity of stringent regulations for the protection of persons working in Lead Factories ; the Vestry referred the matter to their General Purposes Committee for consideration and report. The Committee on the 18th July, 1882, presented to the Vestrv a report received from the Medical Officer of Health upon the subject, which, upon the recommendation of the Committee, was adopted by the Vestry. The following is a copy of the said report:— To the General Purposes Committee of the Vestrv of the Parish of Rotherhithe, July 14th, 1882 Gentlemen, As vou are taking into consideration the letter of the Clerk to the Shoreditch Guardians re cases of Lead Poisoning, referred to you at your last Vestry meeting, I have the honour to inform you, that from personal inspection and observation of the prweess of blue and white lead manufacture in this and other parts of London, consider the conclusions of the St. Leonard's Committee to be substantially correct, as regards the white lead works in or near that parish (21 in number), but not applicable to our own lead factories here, since (a.) The grave effects of lead poisoning, i.e. colic, palsy, and insanity, are practically only observed amongst persons making white lead and not keeping themselves clean. (b.) There is but one white lead factory in Rotherhithe, the two other lead works not making it. 28 (c.) In the factory referred to emyloying 90 white lead workers, stringent precautions are taken by the employers to prevent their men's health suffering, and a tended with marked success. (d.) The specialities of their mannfacture differ materially from the ordinary white lead making, being" mostly wet instead of dry processes, and are much less dangerous to health. (e.) The routine is as follows :— Working- hours from 6 a m. to 5.30 p.m., 1 hour 40 minutes allowed for breakfast and dinner inclusive, no meals allowed to be taken on the premises, and no women workers are employed. The strictest personal cleanliness inculcated under threat of dismissal for contumacy. Washing places provided. Soap, towels, hot water, &c. provided constantly for all hands. Gloves, working' dresses, respirators and boots provided for the day work, and their use enforced. Medical attendance and proplovlactic drinks provided for the men, and sick time paid for. Question of providing working dresses for all hands now (at my request) under consideration bv the firm. (f) No deaths from immediate lead poisoning have occurred in these works. Some few cases of colic, or drop wrist, &c. were distinctly traceable to personal want of cleanliness, and not to the work itself, since many of those engaged in the day work have been at it for 20 years and upwards with no bad effects. (g.) These precautions are far in advance of those recommended by the Chief Inspector of Factories, and if made compulsory on all employers, would, I consider, from my nine years' experience amongst lead workers, prove sufficient to prevent the deplorable results ascertained to follow the east end working. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, BENJAMIN BROWNING, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. The Vestry having received a letter from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works, applying on behalf of the Board to insert glass tablets in the street lamps, with colored inscriptions showing the direction and distance of the fire plugs from the nearest lamp, on the 7th November, 1882, the following resolution was passed by the Vestrv upon the subject, viz.:— " Resolved, that this Vestry do consent to allow the Metropolitan Board of Works " to insert glass tablets in the lamps of this parish, of the description and for the pur" pose mentioned in the letter, and that it be suggested to the Board to add the name " and address of the turncocks on sucb tablets." 29 Mr. George Richard Hemmerde, late Manager of the London and Westminster Rank (Southwark Branch), having resigned the office of Treasurer of the Vestry, on the 21st November, 1882, the Vestry received applications for the office of Treasurer from the following gentlemen, viz.:— Mr. John Thomas Wallis, Manager of the London and Westminster Bank (Southwark Branch.) Mr. Charles J. Lacy, Junr., of the firm of Messrs. Lacy, Hartlaud, Woodbridge and Co., of 98 Jamaica-road, S.E., it was thereupon— " Resolved, that Mr. John Thomas Wallis be appointed Treasurer to the \ estry, "in the place of Mr. George Richard Ilemmerde, resigned.' Tin- Vaults under the public wav belonging to several of the houses in Princesstreet having become unsafe, the Vestry gave notice to the owners to put the said vaults in proper condition. Ultimately, at the request of the owners, the \ estry caused the dangerous portion of the vaults under the roadway to be filled in and bricked up level with the curb of the footway of the street. In February, 1883, a letter was received from the Hon. Secretary of the Roval College of Music as follows, viz.: ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC. President.—H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES, K.G. Direr tor. Hon. Secretary. George Grove, Esq., D.C.L. Charles Morley, Esq. Temporary Offices, I Buckingham Gate, London, S.W., February 15M, 1883. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. Gentlemen, I am desired by the Prince ot Wales to inform you that His Royal Highness hopes to open the Royal College of Music in May next. The amount of money already subscribed enables him to place Fifty Open Scholarships before the country for competition. The successful Competitors for these will have the opportunity of acquiring without cost to themselves, a thorough education in the Art and Science of Music under the Prolessors of the College, extending over a period of three years and upwards, according to the branches studied. The Competition for the Scholarship will take place in April next, at the College, Kensington Gore, London, but, in order to save many Candidates (rouble and the expense of the journey (which must be defrayed by themselves), His Royal Highness proposes to hold Preliminary Examinations throughout the country, with the view of affording to all persons, within the proper limits of age, the opportunity of profiting by the great advantages offered. 30 With this view I have, by His Royal Highness's directions, communicated with the Mayors of the provincial towns of the United Kingdom, and have received very prompt and satisfactory response. His Royal Highness feels confident that, he may rely on your co-operation in the same National cause; and I am therefore directed to express his hope that you will allow the Preliminary Examination for your district to take place in your Public Buildings, beginning on the '28th of March, and that you will nominate three professional Musicians of your district, qualified and willing to act as Honorary Local Examiners, whose duties will be to conduct the Local Preliminary Examinations, to report to the Director of the College the result of such Examinations, and to recommend the Candidates qualified to proceed to the Final Competition before the Director and Board of Professors at the College in Kensington Gore. If you accede to this request, I am directed further to ask you to be good enough to fill up the enclosed Form of reply, and return it to me, not later than the 24th instant. The three gentlemen nominated by you will have their names submitted to the Prince of Wales, and their appointment will be ratified in a document bearing the signature of His Royal Highness, which will be forwarded to each of them before the date fixed for the Examination, together with detailed instructions and requisite Forms of Report, &c. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHAKLES MORLEY, Hon. Secretary. The Vestry, in order to give effect to the proposal of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, made application to the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses in this parish, for the use of the Board-room at the Baths, Deptford Lower-road, for holding local Preliminary Examinations of Candidates, and the Commissioners consented to allow the use of their Board-room and Waiting-rooms for that purpose. The Vestry also obtained the consent of the following lady and gentleman to act as Honorary Local Examiners, at such preliminary Examinations, viz.: Mrs. Watts, Organist of Christ Church, Rotherhithe. W. H. Leslie, Esquire. Six persons from this locality sent in their names as Candidates for the Scholarships in the Royal College of Music, and the preliminary Examination by the Local Examiners, took place on the 29th March, 1883. On the 23rd February, 1883, the Vestry received a letter from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, stating the Board had approved of the plan for the formation of a new road to lead out of the west side of Deptford Lowerroad, and the east side of Union-road, to be called Culling-road, S.E., upon the condition that No. 98 Union-road be removed previously to the occupation by tenants of 31 anv of the houses in the proposed new road, that such road be made of the full width of 40ft. from end to end, and as shown in the deposited plan ; also, that no barriers be at anv time erected, or other obstruction caused to the free use by the public of the said road, ami that the name of the road be affixed at each end thereof. At a General Meeting of the Vestrv held on the 20th March, 1883, it was— " Resolved, that a letter be written to the School Board for London expressing "the regret of this Vestrv at the rapid and continued increase in the amount of the " annual precepts of the Board, and urging that the Board will make every effort to " limit as much as possible their expenditure for the future."
