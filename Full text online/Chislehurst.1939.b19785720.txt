Tel. 18 2 Urban District Council of Chislehurst and Sidcup HEALTH REPORT FOR 1939 Madam and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year 1939, this being the sixth one submitted by me and the seventeenth one I have had the pleasure to submit as Medical Officer of Health of the District concerned. In accordance with the request of the Ministry of Health this Report has been condensed as far as possible, and only contains such information as it is essential to record. The population of the District as estimated by the RegistrarGeneral for the mid-year 1939 is 63,160, as compared with 61,750 in 1938 and 58,670 in 1937. The year 1939 was a satisfactory one from the point of view of Public Health. The Birth Rate showed an increase over last year, the figures being 18.0 and 16.8 respectively. An increase in the Death Rate took place, viz., 9.5 per thousand of population, as compared with 8.5 last year. The Infantile Mortality Rate also showed an increase, this being 42 per thousand registered births as against 36 last year. A large decrease in the number of cases of Infectious Disease notified took place, 358 as compared with 1,120 last year. This is chiefly due to a much smaller number of cases of Measles being notified. In presenting this Report, I beg to take the opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the help and assistance I have received from the Council and all its Officers. In particular I would desire to place on record the efficient and loyal services rendered by Mr. Allen and all the members of the Public Health Department. I am.
