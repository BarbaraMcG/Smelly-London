Vital Statistics. Whereas the Registrar General's estimate of the population at mid-1962 showed a very slight increase on the 1961 census figure, his estimate for mid-1963 reverts to the pattern of former years and once more shows a decrease albeit a small one of some 570 persons. There was a rather smaller excess of births over deaths during 1963 as compared to 1962 and it would therefore appear that some 900 fewer people resided in Southwark during 1963 than during the preceding year. The gradual fall in population of this central London Borough is, of course, conditioned by the proportion of total development formed by residential accommodation. After adjustment by the appropriate comparability factor the birth rate during 1963 was 17.0 per 1,000 of the population this figure being only slightly less than those for the previous two years, which were the highest experienced in Southwark since 1952. The rate for England and Wales was 18.2 per 1,000 of the population. A particularly satisfactory feature of the statistics for 1963 was the infant mortality rate of 18.9 per 1,000 live births being the lowest rate recorded in Southwark since 1956 and comparing favourably with the national figure of 20.9 per 1,000 births. The still birth rate also was reduced from 17.2 per 1,000 total births in 1962 to 13.1, the figure for England and Wales being 17.3. There was little change in the neo-natal mortality rate which was 13.2 per 1,000 live births compared to 14.2 for the country as a whole. No deaths occurred during 1963 which were attributable to pregnancy, childbirth, or abortion. The crude general death rate was 13.8 per 1,000 population as compared to 14.2. the rate experienced during the previous year. After adjustment the figure becomes 13.3 whereas the rate for England and wales was 12.2. per 1,000 population. The most important cause of death was disease of the circulatory system. More people died from respiratory disease than from malignant conditions. One hundred and twenty one people died of bronchitis, sixty four from cancer of the lung and thirteen from pulmonary tuberculosis. Infectious Disease. In the Annual Report for 1960 attention was drawn to the occurrence of 686 cases of dysentery in Southwark during that year, and reference was made to a statement of the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health contained in his Annual Report for 1959, namely "Only detailed attention to personal cleanliness, and above all, the washing of hands after attendance at the toilet, combined with adequate sanitary provision in homes, school and -ii- similar institutions will break the cycle of infection and reduce the incidence". During 1963 the incidence of dysentery in Southwark although reduced to 415 cases, was still too high. Some of these were institutional cases and represented to a very large extent infection introduced from other parts of London. The symptoms of dysentery are frequently not severe. Many of the cases referred to here had no symptoms and were discovered as the result of bacteriological investigation. When all this has been said, however, there remains inescapable evidence of factors operating in the community which favour the spread of this alimentary infection. Bacilliary Dysentery is more infectious than typhoid but there are very many similarities in the mode of spread of both of these diseases. In both cases the reservoir of infectionis man itself, the causal organism being passed in his excreta. The lesson from Aberdeen therefore cannot be ignored. By increased and constant attention to food and personal hygiene not only will the incidence of dysentery be reduced but an important step will have been taken in protecting the community against the more serious disease, typhoid, should it ever be introduced. A community which is vulnerable to dysentery will be vulnerable to typhoid should it appear. More attention must be paid to the washing of hands after toilet and before meals, or before handling food. The advice was continuously tendered by officers of the Public Health Department to mothers, food handlers and school children, throughout the year. On the 10th June 1963 a case of diphtheria came to notice and, in collaboration with the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, nose and throat swabs from a large number of school and home contacts were taken for examination. As a result four cases and seven carriers were immediately disclosed. Investigation of a wide circle of home contacts continued during the holidays and on the resumption of school a further survey was undertaken. In all thirty persons were found to be harbouring the organism of diphtheria and eight of these were considered to be clinical cases. Those infected resided in the south western part of the Borough and multiple cases occurred in several families. Two of the individuals concerned were over school age, five were under school age, while nineteen of the remainder attended one school. The four other children were spread over three different schools. All cases and carriers were admitted to hospital immediately they came to notice. Doctors practising in Southwark, and the appropriate hospitals were informed of the presence of diphtheria in the Borough on the second day of the outbreak. With the authority of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee the local press were told of the position in order that parents might be alerted to the importance of their arranging for any of their children who might be off colour to be seen by the family doctor, and to urge them to have their children's immunisation brought up to date. The diphtheria immunisation state of the children resident in Southwark is well up to average. On the other hand the immunisation record of the actual cases and carriers were found to be unsatisfactory. They had never been immunised or had not completed an adequate course of injections. As a result there was no wide-spread outbreak in the schools attended by these - iii - partially protected children. Although a large number of school children were investigated positive swabs were only found among children living in a very circumscribed area near to the original case. None of the children involved were seriously ill. In the light, however, of experience in other areas of similar small epidemics there was always the fear that some unimmunised child might sustain a serious infection. This aspect itself makes all the work, (and it is considerable) of the detailed investigation of school and home contacts very much worthwhile and I should like to express my appreciation of the co-operation and great assistance received from the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council and his medical and nursing staff. Thanks are also due to Dr. Tomlinson of the Public Health Laboratory Service as well as to the family doctors and the staff of this Department. Measles was epidemic during 1963, 911 cases being reported. Of these 63 occurred during the first year of life and a total of 627 children were four years of age or under. Unfortunately there was one death in the former group. The County Medical Officer of Health has been able to report that only one confirmed case of poliomyelitis paralytic occurred in the County of London during 1963, the individual involved being a non-immunised adult. It is gratifying that the position in Southwark followed a similar pattern, no cases of the disease being reported during the year. In order that this position may be maintained parents should ensure that their children receive the recommended doses of polio vaccine. Health Education. A great deal of attention was given throughout 1963 by the officers of of the Public Health Department to health education which now forms such a large and important part of the work. In conjunction with the London County Council, and arising from the experience of diphtheria in recent years, the importance of parents ensuring that their children are adequately immunised against not only diphtheria but also poliomyelitis, whooping cough, tetanus and tuberculosis was stressed by posters, leaflets and personal precept. The public health inspectors actively transmitted the message of food hygiene into canteens and food establishments throughout the Borough with special reference to the necessity for scrupulous personal hygiene. Following the appointment by the London County Council of Mr. Robertson as a Health Education Officer for the specific purpose of dealing with smoking and health, a mobile unit equipped with publicity material, film strips, film projector and so on visited schools and other establishments in Southwark during July. In particular Mr. Robertson was good enough to show a film and arrange a display for Members of the Council in one of the Committee Rooms of the Town Hall. He indicated the manner in which he was approaching this difficult subject and referred to the generally encouraging and interested reception which was being accorded to him at the various establishments which he was visiting. The Councillors present showed their own interest in the matter by putting a number of searching questions to Mr. Robertson which he answered both skilfully and tactfully. -iv- Accidents in the home received the special attention of the two Women Health Officers who gave practical advice to old people in their own homes. Welfare of the Elderly Miss Doris M. Beer, A. I. S. W., M. R. I. P. H. H., resigned her appointment as Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee during the year to take up a similar position in Lambeth. Her place was taken by Mrs. L. Dean and the extracts from the twelfth annual report of the Committee which are reproduced at the end of this report show once again the valuable work for old people which is being undertaken in Southwark. In view of the continued expansion of the meals service, the overall monthly total exceeding 10,000 meals, consideration was given by the Council and the Old People's Welfare Committee to extending the kitchen so that it should have a sufficient capacity for the preparation of some 1,000 meals per day. A scheme as prepared by Consultant Architects for the reconstruction of the kitchen with a minimum of interference with the work of the kitchen, and the provision of certain additional equipment, at an estimated cost of £7, 500 has been approved by the Council and has received Ministry sanction. Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Joseph Collier, a former Alderman of Southwark, a Holiday Home bearing his name was opened at Stocker Road, Bognor Regis, on the 12th October, 1963 and since that time the Home has brought untold happiness and health to the many Southwark old people who have spent a holiday there. In so far as the Public Health Department is directly concerned the work carried out at the Treatment and Bathing Centre continues to make an important contribution to the welfare of old people residing in Southwark, and the two women Health Officers, as well as the public health inspectorate generally have been most active in this field and as a result have been able to ameliorate and improve the conditions under which some of the elderly reside, as well as bringing a new interest to their lives. Mortuary and Coroner's Court As mentioned in the Annual Report for 1962 the building operations in connection with the extension and modernisation of the Mortuary and Coroner's Court commenced on 6th November of that year. The new premises were brought into use in December 1963 and details of the accommodation now available are set out at the end of this Report. Fluoridation of Water In the early part of the year a report was submitted to the Public Health Committee pointing out that there is now available a wide volume - v - of evidence from America and elsewhere Indicating that if the fluoride content of the water supply is adjusted to one part per million there will be a substantial reduction in dental decay. Since 1956 the water supply of Watford, Kilmarnock and Anglesey has been adjusted to the appropriate level and a report of this survey which was published in July 1962 showed that dental decay in children in the experimental area was reduced by over 50 to 60 per cent. There were no harmful effects . The Minister of Health has intimated to local authorities that he is prepared to approve, under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act 1946, the making of arrangements with water undertakers for the adding of fluoride to water supplies which are deficient in it naturally. There is now ample evidence that fluoridation reduces dental de cay, that from the Water Engineer's point of view it is a practicable and reasonably cheap proposition, and that it is an essentially safe public health measure. It was decided that the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee be informed that this Council are in favour of the Metropolitan Water Board being asked to introduce fluoridation of water at an early date. Crude Spirit Drinking Crude spirit drinking is a problem which has existed in Southwark for many years, and has become more obvious as social conditions have improved. The Borough Council has been anxious to protect local residents from the undoubted nuisance caused by crude spirit drinkers, who, strangers to the locality, practice this habit in public places, as well as to rehabilitate these people and so prevent further deterioration. In this connection it was decided at the end of the year to convene a meeting and a note of the proceedings of the meeting, which was held early in 1964, is set out at the end of this report. Conclusion I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the Chairmen and Members of the various Committees of the Council for their encouragement throughout the year, as well to the Chief Officers and the staff of their departments all of whom have been most helpful in regard to public health matters at all times. Reference has already been made to the assistance received from Dr. W. H. S. Wallace, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, and the members of his staff as well as from Dr. Tomlinson of the Public Health Laboratory Service in connection with diphtheria, and it remains now to express my gratitude to them for their co-operation, and that of their Departments, on many other occasions. - vi - The relations of the Southwark Public Health Department with the family doctors practising in the area has always been good and I would thank them sincerely for this. Finally, to the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. H. Archer, to the Senior Clerk, Mr. E. A. Clark, and to each individual member of the staff of the Public Health Department, goes my very sincere gratitude for their loyal support and assistance so generously forthcoming once more during 1963.

SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE BOROUGH The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark lies to the south of the River Thames the mid-stream of which forms its northern boundary. The Borough forms a boundary with Lambeth to the west; as far south as Kennington Park, to the south with Camberwell, and to the east with Bermondsey. The landward part of the Borough extends to 1,131 acres and is divided into ten Wards. The Elephant and Castle forms a landmark, roughly dividing the borough into two. The portion of the borough between the Elephant and the river is becoming increasingly devoted to wharves, warehouses, diverse industry including food factories, and the printing trade, and offices, while the area south and south-east of the Elephant is mainly residential in character. The provision of office accommodation in the northern part of the Borough continues a trend of commercialisation which was commented upon sixty years ago by the Borough's first Medical Officer of Health in his first annual report. The momentum of development has however of late rapidly increased, not only in the north but also in the southern part of the borough where the improved aesthetic effects of the new and attractive housing estates which have been built both by this Council and the London County Council, with their associated open spaces become ever more apparent. The role of Southwark as a religious centre is symbolised by the two fine Cathedrals which it contains. The historic and cultural aspects of the borough are well known and the commercial and industrial importance of this central London borough have continued to increase. The extensive redevelopment which is taking place at the Elephant and Castle, the Brandon Estate and elsewhere are already giving Southwark a new look. A large modern office block already houses the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Health now occupy newly constructed offices at the Elephant and Castle. -2- VITAL STATISTICS Land Area 1,131 acres Estimated Number of Dwellings 25,211 Dwellings Erected by Borough Council During Year 92 * Approximate Rateable Value (Total) £6,270,720 (Dwellings) £1,646,197 * Sum represented by a Penny Rate £25,195 population: Census 1961 86,249 Registrar General's estimate (mid-1963) 85,870 This estimate represents a decrease in the figure for 1962 of 570 The natural increase in population - that is, the excess of births over deaths - was 391 compared with 418 for the previous year. 1953 - 96,870 1958 - 89,920 1954 - 95,370 1959 - 88,720 1955 - 93,820 1960 - 88,690 1956 - 92,300 1961 - 86,270 1957 - 91,140 1962 - 86,440 Live - Births - 1580: Rate per 1,000 pop 18.3 Adjusted by comparability factor (0.93) 17.0 Still births - 21: Rate per 1,000 total births 13.1 Total births - Live and still 1,601 Total deaths - 1189.

Lloyd, T.D.) The number of premises requiring treatment for infestations of the usual domestic insect pests has greatly reduced during the past few years. In 1963 only 857 rooms in dwelling houses were treated for bedbugs infestations. A certain amount of this disinfestation was of a precautionary nature only, preceding re-housing in Southwark Borough Council or London County Council housing accommodation. These figures compare very favourably with those for the year 1953 when it was found necessary to treat 1,713 rooms in domestic premises, mainly for substantial infestations of bed-bugs. There would appear to be three reasons for this marked decrease in bed-bug infestations. The first ana main reason is obviously the demolition of many of the older and often heavily infested dwellings and their replacement with modern houses and flats. Secondly, the effectiveness of modern insecticides and the comparative ease with which these insecticides can be applied. Finally, there is the most welcome change of attitude of mind towards these pests. In the past they were, in some areas, often tolerated and accepted almost as part of normal living. Frequently, when the presence of an infestation of bugs was indicated to an occupier, the reply was: "Yes, of course we've got bugs, everyone has. They were here when we came. They feed on the wall plaster!" When it was learnt that the thriving colonies of bugs in the rooms fed only on blood and that the "heat bumps" on Johnny's neck were, in fact, bug bites, there was usually some concern expressed. However, it is now generally well known that with modern pesticides, an infestation of these "bloodsuckers" and other domestic vermin can be eradicated quickly with a minimum of inconvenience to the occupiers. Furthermore, in this Borough no charge is made to the occupiers of dwellings in Southwark for the services of the Council's disinfestation staff. A considerable number and variety of other insect and similar pests were dealt with in both domestic and other premises during the year. These included Beetles in adult and immature forms, (Dermestes, Blaps, Wood-boring, Spider beetles and other species.) Flies, House and Blow fly species, Cockroaches, Silverfish, Pigeon Mites, Clover Mites, Ants and Slugs. It may be difficult to appreciate, unless directly affected by the invasion of one's home by these pests, that clover mites, ants and slugs could be a problem in a Central London Borough. They are, of course, usually associated with much less urbanised areas. However the minor infestations that we have of these normally rural pests are a small price to pay for the pleasures derived from seeing things growing naturally, on the small areas left to us. -18- Infectious Disease Cases: Enquiries and Visits Total 556 as under: Diphtheria 21 Gastro enteritis 2 Scarlet Fever 71 Dysentery (bacilliary) 290 Smallpox contacts 1 Food Poisoning (includes 3 visits to factory canteens) 14 Erysipelas 7 Meningococcal infections 10 Pyrexia of unknown origin 3 Revisits etc. 137 Disinfection following infectious diseases Rooms treated (Formalin solution) 85 Library books treated 198 Other disinfection, Tuberculosis etc. 7 Treatment of Verminous and Infected Articles (including precautionary disinfestation) Verminous Infected articles articles treated treated Beds 74 1 Palliasses 474 14 Bolsters 56 2 Pillows 689 67 Cushions 16 Nil Blankets 1152 93 Sheets 653 62 Quilts 436 44 Other articles (clothing, etc.) 36,560 2,486 Rehousing Precautionary disinfestation of soft goods and bedding 133 families. -19- Scabies and Vermin Treatments Scabies Vermin Males Females Males Femalcs Lambeth cases 20 30 18 52 treatments 32 51 18 52 Southwark cases 14 34 316 103 treatments 26 49 316 104 L.C.

During the year, 2 complaints were received. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and the samples analysed and found satis factory. Whilst the Board from time to time draws samples for bacteriological and chemical examination, samples of drinking water have been taken by the Public Health Inspectors and submitted to the Public Analyst who has reported in each case that the supply was satisfactory. In many of the old tenement buildings the water supply is communal, there being taps on the staircase landings whilst in others the water passes through storage tanks on the roofs. The indirect supply ofwater for drinking purposes has been considered in a number of cases to be unsatisfactory and representations have been made to the owners with a view to all taps being supplied direct from the rising main. -24- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Section 98 During the year 303 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board.

Stubbs) The figures recorded by the Council's instruments show that during the early months of the year there was an increase in air pollution. This was probably due to the increased consumption of fuel because of the severe wintry conditions at that time. However, during the last few months there was a marked decrease in all the figures compared with the previous year. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee, representations were made to the Ministers of Health, Transport and Housing and Local Government that research into the dangers to health of emissions from the engines of road vehicles should be intensified and means found for removing sulphur fumes from the atmosphere, and as to what additional action sight be taken for stopping or minimising the emission of fumes from the engines of road vehicles. Replies from the Ministries stated that the exhaust gases of road vehicles are not a prominent source of sulphur pollution and are small in comparison with those derived from domestic and industrial fuel combustion The results of the investigations carried out by the Ministers so far have shown that the concentration of fumes likely to be found in our streets, under normal conditions, is not sufficient to have any adverse effectupon health. The Ministries stated that the Medical Research Council and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research are pursuing theil invesgation. into this question of atmospheric pollution and its effect on Ihealth. The schedules of final costs of the adaptations and replacements in Smoke Control Area No. 1 which came into operation on 1st November, 1961, were prepared. The total costs amounted to £6,325.3.4d. covering work in 572 dwellings. Of this amount £2,530. 1.4d was recoverable from the Exchequer. The estimated ootal cost was £8,250 covering 640 dwellings. It was found on re-visiting the area that a number of dwellings !ha.d been converted to approved appliances before the date of confirmation of the Order and also that some residents preferred to install portable electric heaters which do not rank for grant. It can be claimed that the whole scheme worked smoothly and many residents expressed satisfaction with the new grates and supported the Council's efforts towards clean air. A meeting was held at the Town Hall on 11th September, 1963, to discuss (1) The availability and distribution of solid smokeless fuels (particularly in connection with the proposed No. 3 Smoke Control Area) and (2) priority deliveries of fuel to the sick and aged in the Borough. The Mayor presided 31 over the meeting which was attended by coal merchants, nationalised undertakings, smokeless fuel manufacturers and other interested bodies. Assurances were given that the additional supply of 750 tons of smokeless fuel reqiired for the proposed smoke control area would be available unless unforeseen difficulties arose. As regards the question of priority deliveries to the sick and aged, the coal merchants undertook to do their utmost to get deliveries to such cases brought to their notice. The Smoke Control Order No.3 was made by the Council on the 3rd December, 1963, and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. The area adjoins No. 2 area and is residential. It is bounded by Kennington Park Road, Penton Place, Manor Place, rear of premises on the south-east side of Doddington Grove, Cooks Road and Kennington Park Place, and covers fifty acres. The area contains I, 896 separate dwellings, 34 shops and other premises, one day nursery, two schools, one Territorial Army Depot, one church and four factories and workplaces. The figures of the survey showed that appliances in 692/dwellings needed replacement or adaptations with gas ignition, at an estimated cost of £10,750. Approval was given for a detailed survey to be carried out in a proposed No.4 Smoke Control Area and the necessary work has commenced This area adjoins No. 3 area and is bounded by Newington Butts, Dante Road, Brook Drive, Kennington Road, Lambeth Road, King Edward Walk St. George's Road, Walworth Road, Manor Place and Penton Place, and covers 97 acres. Consideration was given by the Public Health Committee! to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular Nol 60/62 regarding dates of completion of smoke control prograsmes, and they decided that with the engagement of additional staff, it would be possible for theBorougHs Smoke Control Programme to be completed two years earlier than the date first suggested, and accordingly, the target date will now be 1972. Eight notifications were received of proposals to install new furnaces, and plans and specifications in respect of two other installations were submitted and approval given. The Council has a daily volumetric smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus, two standard deposit gauges, and three lead peroxide instruments The Central Electricity Generating Board has a lead peroxide instrument on the jetty of the Bankside Power Station. During the year 11 complaints were received of smoke and grit emmission, 172 observations and inspections were made, and 8 Intimation Notices were issued. In all cases the managements were co-operative and it was not necessary to institute legal proceedings. 32 Deposited matter at following sites:— 1963 Rainfall (inches) BANKSIDE WALWORTH ROAD Mean Daily Concentration of Sulphur Dioxide micro gms. per cubic metre.

There are three pools with sizes and capacities as follows. Total attendance for the year ending March 31st 1964 were 242,820. (a) lst-Class Swim Length 120ft. Width 40ft. Capacity 157.000 gallons. (b) 2nd-Class Swim Length 144ft. Width 35ft. Capacity 164,898 gallons. (c) Small Swim Length 60ft. Width 25ft. Capacity 49,000 gallons. Method of Treatment Filtration through sand filters installed by Paterson Engineering Co. in 1935. Breakpoint Chlorination with Chlorine Gas Plants. Frequency of Change 3½ hour turnover on each pool.. Source of Supply Metropolitan Water Board. Twenty-one bath samples were analysed by the Public Analyst. It is standard practice to record the number of bathers who have used the bath prior to the sample being taken and the number of bathers in the pool at the time of sampling, and the appearance of the water. In seven cases the appearance was cloudy, but five of these over 100 bathers were using the bath immediately prior to the time of sampling. In 17 cases the bacterial count was not more than 5 per million. Free chlorine ranged from 0.5 to 2 parts per million.

ANIMAL BOARDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1963. This Act comes into operation on January 1st 1964, and provides regulations for the health welfare and safety of dogs and cats kept in boarding establishments for animals. Section I of the Act provides that'no person shall keep a boarding establishment for animals unless licenced by the Council. The severe wintery conditions at the beginning of the year caused innumerable problems of frozen water supplies. All complaints were investigated, and as far as possible the necessary action was taken and suitable advice given. The Metropolitan Water Board rendered excellent services by installing stand pipes for emergency water supplies. Frozen soil pipes in blocks of flats presented a particularly serious problem. Many complaints followed later of burst pipes and water damage, and facilities were available for drying out bedding, carpets etc. at the Treatment and Bathing Centre and at the Public Baths. The construction of the roofs of many of the older properties being of the valley type, resulted in a build up of frozen snow, which resulted in water damage to ceilings. Such cases were the subject of notices to the owners.

By Section 22 of the Act, Tenement Buildings, where either sanitary conveniences or personal washing facilities are shared were brought within the ambit of the Act. There is a considerable number of tenement buildings in the Borough and many of these are without adequate sanitary conveniences and personal washing facilities. Furthermore, some of these tenement buildings are already included in the current slum clearance programme. As a result of informal action by writing to the owners of tenement buildings and tenement houses, there has been improvement in the conditions relating to appropriate management. The Council has adopted a Code covering amenities and this is being used as a guide when discussing necessary improvements with owners. It has been necessary to make three Management Orders under the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962. At the same time as investigations are made into the provision of amenities, regard is had to means of escape from fire and several cases have been referred to the London County Council in accordance with the Code of Practice with a view to the appropriate Notices being served. Experience has shown that with the new powers management has improved and amenities are being provided without the necessity of resorting to formal action. 39 RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCE ACT, 1960 This Act, which came into operation on December 1st 1963, is concerned with the control of the accumulation and disposal of radioactive wastes. Persons who keep or use radioactive material, will, unless exempted, be required to register with the Minister of Housing and Local Government and to obtain authorisation from him for the accumulation or disposal of radioactive waste. The Act applies to premises and also mobile apparatus. The expression "radioactive material" includes the following substances and any articles made from or incorporating them:- 1. A substance containing an element listed in the Act, if the concentration of that element is greater than limits specified in the Act. 2. Substances who radioactivity is attributable either wholly or partly to a process of nuclear fission or other process whereby a substance is bombarded by neutrons or ionising radiations. " Radioactive waste" includes:- 1. Any scrap, surplus, or spoilt "radioactive material". 2. Any other waste substance or article (whether solid, liquid, gas or vapour) which has become radioactive by contamination. The Acts exempts from its provisions Crown premises, premises of the Atomic Energy Authority and sites licensed under the Nuclear Installations (Licensing and Insurance) Act,1959, and as the definition of radioactive material brings within its scope a number of minor uses and some commonplace items not normally regarded as radioactive (for example lighter flints and incandescent mantles), the Act also provides for orders to be made exempting certain materials, and a number of such orders has already been made. Except where for reasons of national security, information must in particular cases, be restricted, copies of certificates of registration and authorisation will be sent to public and local authorities, who will be informed-of Crown establishments in their area where radioactive materials are used, unless national security is involved. The Act provides that local authorities shall not take account of any radioactivity possessed by any substance, article or premises 40 when considering taking action under the general public health legislation, but the Act does not detract from powers to take proceedings in respect of radioactive waste disposals for reasons unconnected with radioactivity. The Minister must consult public or local authorities as he thinks fit before granting authorisations for the disposal of radioactive waste from major nuclear establishments or where the disposal is likely to involve the need for special precautions by an authority. The Act contains provisions relating to punishment of offenders but stipulates that no proceedings shall be instituted except by the Minister or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions The Government policy on the disposal of radioactive wastes contemplates the use in suitable cases of local conventional methods, e.g. discharge to sewers or disposal on local authority refuse tips, and it is felt desirable that such methods should be used where practicable, since by them harmless dispersal can most often be achieved and increased exposure caused by multiple handling avoided. The Act places a duty on a local authority to accept and deal with radioactive wastes sent to their refuse tip in accordance with an authorisation, and the Ministry advise that such waste should be taken straight to the tip without being sorted for salvage and that it should be buried below at least five feet of refuse or refuse ash, where it is likely to remain undisturbed indefinitely. 41 CRUDE SPIRIT DRINKING The Southwark Metropolitan Borough Council has been concerned with regard to crude spirit drinking for two reasons, namely: - (a) to protect the local residents from the undoubted nuisance caused by crude spirit drinkers, who, strangers to the locality, practice this habit in public places and (b) to rehabilitate these people and so prevent further deterioration. To this end the Southwark Borough Council convened a meeting on the 27th February, 1964 which was attended by representatives of the London County Council, the City Corporation, the Stepney Borough Council, the Metropolitan Police and the Salvation Army, as well as Southwark Borough Councillors. Mr. Ray Gunter, Member of Parliament for Southwark, was unfortunately unable to attend but the meeting had the benefit of the advice of Dr. R.V. Phillipson, O.B.E.,ofthe Ministry of Health, Dr. J. Griffith Edwards, The Maudsley Hospital. Dr. H. D. Chalke, who in addition to being Medical Officer of Health of Camberwell, is Chairman of the Camberwell Council on Alcoholism, was present as well as Mr. C.A. Preece, After-Care Officer, of the Royal London Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society which has done such valuable work in this field; Dr. J.E. Epsom. The Medical Officer of Health of Bermondsey was represented. The Chair was taken by Councillor W. A. Miller, Chairman of the Southwark Public Health Committee, who welcomed the delegates and outlined the reasons for calling the meeting. The Medical Officer of Health for Southwark was asked to enlarge upon the position in Southwark; he emphasised that the meeting was concerned with the drinking of crude spirits rather than with the whole field of alcoholism. Southwark, Stepney and the City appeared to be mainly affected and in southwark the finding of surgical spirit bottles on open spaces and bomb sites suggested that surgical spirits was increasingly being consumed as compared with methylated spirits. Whereas in Scotland the sale of surgical spirit is controlled to the same extent as methylated spirits, in England there are no such controls. Dr. Cameron referred to the financial assistance given by the London County Council to the East London Mission, The Camberwell Samaritans and the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society, for work amongst alcoholics and he drew the attention of the meeting to measures which had been suggested by Dr. Griffith Edwards, namely provisionof work andspecial hostels for rehabilitation. Councillor J. Olley, of Stepney Borough Council, stated that there were about 100 crude spirit drinkers in that Borough. He called for greater liason between the Police and the Medical Profession and emphasised the need for compulsion so that these addicts could receive treatment. He also felt that the Government should 42 nake funds available to local authorities so that this work could be carried out on behalf of the strangers in their midst. Representing the London County Council, The Reverend Dr. Donald Soper intimated that the Council had recently set up a working party to consider the question of crude spirit drinking. He wondered whether the Mental Health Act of 1959 did not already provide the means to compel addicts to undergo treatment. These views were reiterated by many of those present during the wide discussion which followed. A surprising degree of success was already being obtained in this field by many workers, some of whom were present. Additional financial assistance was required to extend it. It was resolved- (a) That, despite all the good work being undertaken by various voluntary organisations, the problem can only be dealt with by new legislation, including provisions for the compulsory treatment of addicts and the payment of grants for the establishment of hostels, and to enable them to give assistance wherever necessary. (b) That there should be greater restrictions on thesale of surgical spirit and that consideration should be given by Parliament to providing for the addition of other denaturants to all forms of crude spirit to render it undrinkable. (c) That the work of voluntary organisations should be maintained with the aid of grants and that co-oper ation between all interested bodies should be encouraged. (d) That the Minister be informed of the views expressed by the various Representatives at the Meeting, and requested to consider as a matter of urgency some form of legislation which:- (1) would strengthen existing powers and give more stringent control over the sale of spirits of the nature under discussion. (2) make adequate funds available to the appropriate authorities and voluntary bodies to enable more to be done to combat the existing situation so far as these unfortunate people are concerned by providing treatment and rehabilitation. (e) That in view of the action already taken by the London County Council in setting up a working party to 43 sider the problem of crude spirit drinking, the decisions of this meeting be conveyed to that Authority, and to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, and that they be asked to support the recommendations of the meeting. 44 FOOD THE INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD During the year, 126,947 tons of imported food were inspected under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations, 193 7 and 1948, and the Preservatives in Food Regulations 1962.

MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926 At the time of inspection of foodstuffs on importation, and in shops and on street stalls, attention has been given to the requirements relating to Indication of origin. The products to which the Act applies, have been satisfactorily marked. These are as follows:— Fresh Apples Bacon and Ham Currants Poultry Sultanas Meat Raisins Margarine Eggs in shell Malt products Dried eggs Frozen or chilled Salmon Oat Products and Sea Trout Raw Tomatoes Butter Cucumbers Honey 49 ICE CREAM There are 286 ice-cream dealers and 10 manufacturers in this borough, a decrease of 8 dealers since last year. Most of the sellers sold only pre-packed ice cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. Twenty-five samples of ice-cream were taken with the following result s:- 23 samples, Grade I 1 sample Grade II 1 sample Grade III In addition: Twenty-one samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition, and all were found to be satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises and copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned.

The first unit comprises the Coroner's Court room, which has been redecorated and refurnished and which has an entrance from the public gardens to the West of the building, together with new jury and witness rooms connecting with the officers of the coroner and his officers. Second is the accommodation for the Coroner and his officers including general offices, interview rooms and waiting rooms with a main entrance from Tennis Street to the East of the building. The third unit comprises the Caretaker's living accommodation planned as a self contained flat above the Coroner's offices and with its own entrance from Tennis Street but having direct internal communication with the mortuary. Next is the mortuary area itself with autopsy rooms and cold storage equipment having its own separate entrance from a continuation of Tennis Street to the North. The pathologist and staff accommodation forms the fifth unit housed in the old cottage building which has been altered and redecorated to include changing rooms and showers together with a secretary's room. This section again has its own entrance from Tennis Street and from the public gardens. The sixth unit is the viewing room which is housed in the centre Of the building. This viewing room provides the only physical link between the mortuary and the staff office accommodation so that indentific&tion of a body can be made without the viewer entering the mortuary proper. The basement forms the last and seventh unit comprising the boiler house, incinerator, record storage and museum. As with most specialist design projects of this nature, problems arose during the initial planning stages. Literature on mortuaries in general was practically non-existent although the Committee of Clinical Pathologists was in the process of making a report on mortuary design. That Committee later reported that, in their view, the majority of mortuaries in this country were cramped and awkward with few facilities and that there was very considerable scope for improvements in mortuary units. Here, in the new Borough Mortuary, continuity of design and special services play a large part in making this the most advanced building of. its kind in the country. The walls and flooring of the mortuary area have been covered with PVC sheeting sealed to the surfaces with a special adhesive. The sheets are welded together to ensure a watertight joint and the floor and wall junctions are coved for easy cleaning and general maintenance. -55- Throughout the mortuary, which is flyproofed, warm and filtered air is passed through air griils at ceiling level, thermostatically controlled to a required temperature, then extracted through ducts which discharge above roof level to avoid recirculation of the air and possible dissemination of infection. The general spaciousness of the mortuary including the post mortem room and the foul room is designed to safeguard the health of the pathologists and mortuary attendants from this particular hazard. Under floor hot water coils provide background heat in the mortuary area, with the exception of the foul room, so the whole area is kept at an equitable temperature at all times of the year. These heating and ventilation services are provided by twin oil fire boilers in the basement and a ventilation plant room on the first floor. A microphone has been suspended above each necropsy tabie inthe post mortem room and in the foul room so that notes can be taken inthe secretary's room which adjoins the post mortem area. As loud speakers have been installed on the wails, two-way conversation is possible with the secretary who operates a control panel in her room. Another new service is the first installation by the G.P.O., of loud speaking telephones in the mortuary area. By means of elbow control bottons, calls can be received and made from the mortuary without interruption of work. This apparatus is completely waterproofed for easy cleaning and sterilisation. To complete this communications system, there is a 24-hour 4-track recorder and two microphones installed in the court room to tape proceedings, together with a deaf aid amplifier for witnesses. Natural lighting is obtained through North lights in the mortuary ceiling and augmented by high intensity fluorescent tubes above the lay lights which are made of a polythene skin stretched over a metal frame and removable for easy cleaning. The whole of the mortuary area has been designed to allow for sterile working conditions and ease of operation. DETAILS OF UNITS The hearse enters the mortuary through sliding and folding doors leading to the reception bay and the body is then taken to the adjoining documentation area which connects with the mortuary area through swing doors. Just before these swing doors, is the preparation room which contains direct access to a three-tier deep freeze refrigerator, essential in a river borough for drowned persons and other cases involving considerable decomposition of the body. This refrigerator also links the preparation and foul rooms as it can be opened from each end. -56- the foul room In the foul room is a stainless steel and revolving necropsy table with a circular base designed by the architect and similar to the four tables in the post mortem room. These bases contain and conceal hot and cold water pipes, the main drainage outlets and also air suction pipes linked to a motor in the sluice room. The foul room aiso has a stainless steel sink unit with elbow-operated surgeon's taps which are repeated again in the post mortem room. Above the necropsy table is a specially designed telescopic and revolving inspection light. This room has been specially insulated with cork so that the temperature can be reduced to and maintained at 50.F. In emergencies this room can be used for additional body storage. An observation window links the post mortem room with the foul room and this window can be obscured by shutters which can also be used as chalk boards. THE POST MORTEM ROOM In the post mortem room are the four stainless steel necropsy tables, with one revolving for demonstration purposes. Behind this table is a blackboard set flush to the wall, used with non-dusting chalk for diagrams and data. Also installed in this room is a special gas-proof and water-proof X-ray viewing unit. THE COLD STORAGE AREA Parallel to the post mortem room is the cold storage area with four-tier refrigerators designed to hold 36 bodies. Equipment in this area includes a special weighing trolley provided by a specialist sub-contractor to the Architect's detail. THE VIEWING ROOM The only link with the court and the mortuary is the viewing room which has been carefully designed to give the appearance of a private chapel of rest. Bodies are viewed from a separate lobby through a window covered by electrically operated curtains. THE BUILDING'S EXTERIOR The exterior of the building expresses the functions of its several parts. Aluminium curtain walling has been used for the outside of the office area walls on the ground floor whilst the exterior of the superintendent's flat above has been treated with "tile hanging" creating a domestic atmosphere. -57- At the mortuary entrance, the large sliding and folding doors enable the hearses to completely enter the building away from the public view. Pacing brick has been used for the rest of the building but careful thought has been given to the brickwork enclosing the mortuary area and facing onto the public gardens. Here, the architect has used the same facing brick but incorporating a triangular pattern of yellow and dark red bricks. This relieves a long stretch of wall and forms a suitable background for the shrubs and rose trees which will be planted in the garden. Inside, the coroner's offices full use has been made of natural wood and bright, clear colours giving a light and airy interior. Natural day lighting could only be obtained by roof light, apart from the long windows in the coroner's staff offices overlooking the street, but nowhere is there a feeling of gloom.

Dean, Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee:— -60- We have pleasure in presenting the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for the year 1963-4. The past year brought changes in staff: in October Miss Beer left to become Organising Secretary of the Lambeth Old People's Welfare Committee and took with her our very best wishes. During the interim Mrs. Campbell, Workshops Organiser, acted as Deputy Organising Secretary for nearly three months, a position of onerous responsibility which she filled with great competence. Mrs. Dean, formerly Welfare Officer at Newington Lodge, was appointed as Organising Secretary and began work at St. Alban's Hall in February. A notable feature of the past year's work is the expansion of the meals service; three new luncheon clubs have been launched with success in areas where there is a specific need. In addition, the number of meals served to the homebound is ever-increasing, and our overall monthly total now exceeds 10,000. One of the highlights of the year was the opening of our very own Holiday Home at Bognor Regis in October. It was the culmination of several years of intensive effort on the part of the Fund Raising Committee, but it could only have been brought to finality by the generosity of Mr. Joseph Collier. The old people can now book throughout the year and be sure of a welcome at their own home by the sea. We again thank the Borough Council for its generous help and it understanding of our problems. The Mayor, Councillor Mrs. Clunn, J. P., has shown great interest in our progress and we are grateful for her help. Our M.P.. Mr. Ray Gunter, and his wife have proved staunch friends, giving us active support in all our efforts, and we should like to thank them. The various activities of the organisation have continued, each supported with enthusiasm and by increasing numbers. We are happy that so many pensioners spend their days at the centre—finding satisfaction in the companionship of others and generally enjoying a full life. But we must remember that there are many lonely people whom we have not yet seen, perhaps because they do not know where to find us, or because they are homebound. A Visiting Committee under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Gunter has been formed and this should fill a great need. It is hoped to co-ordinate the efforts of all voluntary welfare groups by inviting them to meet at St. Alban's Hall and plan areas to be covered by regular visitors, thus eliminating the risk of overlapping and ensuring that no section of the Borough will be forgotten. In this way St. Alban's Hall will fulfill its function as the centre of welfare work for the old people of Southwark, with teams of visitors reporting through area leaders to the Committee, whilst still retaining the individual character of their own organisation—some of the churches have already responded to our invitation and we hope to draw in many more. There is, however, another problem group for whom help is urgently needed: those discharged from hospital and not tit to fend for themselves. For them a weekly visitor is not enough—they need a kindly person who will volunteer to stay all day if necessary, and come in for several days, to see them through the worst hours of weakness, to raise their morale by friendliness and encouragement—in fact. to hasten complete recovery and help them to cope with normal life once more. With hospital beds so scarce there must be many old people discharged while still very frail, and many who come home to a lonely room; the doctor, the district nurse and the home help all do their share, but there are long hours of solitariness when depression and weakness take their toll, and for these cases we plead. In the coming year we should like to see such a scheme organised and we need many volunteers who could be called upon in emergencies of this kind. Thus we could more nearly achieve the fulfilment of our aims—the care of all elderly people, whatsoever their need. -61- CHIROPODY Foot treatment means so much to old peole and the demand for it increases all the time. We now have six sessions per week in the clinic at St. Alban's Hall and a domiciliary session weekly. Among those treated at the clinic each week are fifteen handicapped people who are brought in by transport. Unfortunatelv, owing to large numbers, the interval between appointments is long. Even with the additional sessions granted during the past year, there is a lapse of two months between treatments in the clinic and for the handicapped treated at home the interval may be sixteen weeks. In these circumstances it is particularly difficult to fit in urgent cases reported by visitors and it is distressing to have to disappoint old people in this most vital service. Over 3,000 treatments have been given at the clinic during the past year, in addition to 210 by the domiciliary service. MEALS SERVICE The year 1963-4 has been remarkable for the expansion of luncheon clubs in the borough and for the increasing number of meals supplied to the homebound. Luncheon clubs had so far functioned at Nelson Square and Quinn Square, on the premises of the Blackfriars Settlement where daily numbers average 20 and 16 respectively. Various small improvements to ensure the efficiency of the service have been recently introduced and these clubs continue their valuable work of providing meals for old people in the northern part of the borough. On 24th June last a luncheon club was opened at the W.V.S. headquarters in Merrow Street. We are most grateful to that organisation for the loan of initial equipment and for all its pioneer work in establishing the club which was badly needed in this area. From a small beginning the daily average of meals served has risen to 24. On 22nd October a luncheon club was opened in All Saints' and St. Stephen's Hall in Surrey Square and is proving a great boon to old people living on the border of Camberwell. Thanks are due to the Reverend B.Hammond,Mrs. Hammond, and their parish workers for their energetic efforts and co-operation. Edward Edwards Almshouses now have their own luncheon club on the premises and this fills a great need for these residents who live so far from St. Alban's Hall. About 20 meals are served here daily. The establishment of luncheon clubs has helped somewhat to relieve pressure on the Meals-on-Wheels service, on which demands seem to be ever-increasing Particularly in the winter months when old people are prone to fall ill it is so essential for them to be able to rely on a hot meal brought to the door; and we are anxious to make sure that no homebound person is left without a hot dinner A survey was made of all those receiving meals-on-wheels to investigate the possible need for a seven-day service. Happily it disclosed that less than three per cent were unable to have a hot meal at the weekend, brought in by the home help. Such cases are receiving special attention. Meals-on-Wheels helpers continue to do excellent work by reporting on those people who should be visited, and are unfailing in their interest in the welfare of the homebound even to the extent of visiting them in their spare time. Our grateful thanks are due to W.V.S. helpers in this service. Our restaurant service flourishes—in spite of the inevitable slight rise in charge (to 1/-) large numbers come regularly to St. Alban's Hall for dinner. There has been no increase in the price of morning coffee and tea (Id.) nor of the special 6d tea arranged on Wednesdays for those who stay for the evening entertainment. On Fridays groups of the handicapped are brought in by ambulance and enjoy a meal with friends—this is their rare opportunity to have contact with the world outside, and it is hoped to expand the service. The following table shows the comparative figures of meals served during the past four years: -62- Restaurant MeaLs-on-Wheels Luncheon Clubs Total 1960/61 41,976 37,119 9,413 88,508 1961/62 46.800 48.549 6,875 102.224 1962/63 44.336 56.393 6,572 107,301 1963/64 42,661 53,905 16,853 113,419 the holiday home Saturday, 12th October, 1963, was a great day in the history of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for it marked another achievement, the opening of the Joseph Collier Holiday Home at Bognor Regis. For several years the Fund Raising Committee had been working hard to raise the necessary money; they began with the competition for the Ford Classic car given by Mr. David Rowse, through which a considerable sum was raised. When an eminently suitable building came into the market, thanks to the generosity of Mr. Joseph Collier (who opened his first draper's shop at the Elephant and Castle), the purchase was made possible by his cheque for £15,000. On the day of the opening about 60 guests were invited, representing the various committees and friends of St. Alban's Hall and also representatives of the old people. Mrs. Collier, accompanied by her daughter and in the presence of the Mayor of Southwark (Councillor Mrs. Clunn, j.P.) and the Mayor and Mayoress of Bognor Regis, performed the opening ceremony. There followed an introduction by the Chairman of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee, Councillor A. E. Knight, with speeches by Mrs. Collier, the Mayor of Southwark, Alderman A. j. Gates, j.P., Mr. Nadler and Mr. Peter Dale. After a blessing on the Home refreshments were served. The Home, formerly a hotel, is very close to the sea front and gardens and therefore in a most suitable position for the old people. It is tastefully furnished and decorated, with many modern amenities. The first party from Southwark spent a happy time there at Christmas and since then groups of old people have been booking for one or two weeks so that all accommodation is now reserved from May until the end of the summer. workshops The Workshops centre is now in its Third Year and continues to give our Senior Citizens work in which they have pleasure in participating. Since our last report the pay scale has been increased from 1/- to l/3d. per hour, although whether this will be maintained depends very much on the future work supply. We shall be pleased to receive enquiries for further work. As regards the workshop personnel individually and collectively the therapeutic and psychological effect of no longer feeling age as a burden, has given them a purpose, and through the amenities and social life of the Borough they can now be integrated into something where they are both useful and wanted. In so doing they solve the problem of their solitude by having the chance of meeting people of their own age. capabilities and interest. From personal contact and enquiry it would appear that during the weekend periods away from the Workshop they suffer the same feelings of loneliness as their fellow members in that they neither see nor hear from anyone with whom they are normally in daily contract, but is it felt that some compensation for this state of affairs is offered when they return to the Workshop with its atmosphere of warmth and friendliness. -63- No work undertaken is of a difficult nature or considered to be beyond the capabilities of the member to whom it is allocated. Typical work, for instance includes folding circulars, machine stitching, greyhound and football cards, canon filling and packing and assembly of simple boxes, etc: in fact anything where finger manipulation can be employed after adequate instruction. Work is for a period of two hours in the morning, with a coffee break, and two hours in the afternoon, with a tea break. In addition the members have full liberty; there is no compulsion about anything, and there is a waiting list for employment should any leave or drop out. A tinfoil collection is also operated and up to date has realised the amount of £6. The Annual Workshop Conference was held at Regent Street. Polytechnic Annexe on 1st April, 1964. the speakers being Dame Sybil Thorndike and Dr. C. O. S. Blyth-Brooks. There were the usual stands of workshop exhibits which proved to be of interest to all. At the subsequent discussions many subjects were brought up by various organisers on which a report will be issued in due course by the Fellowship. DICKENS FAIR The Dickens Fair of 1963 took place on Saturday, 30th November at St. Alban's Hall. That morning publicity was given by a cavalcade of Veteran Cars through the borough and a much larger number of people visited the Fair than in the previous year. At 11.30 a.m. it was declared open by Miss Marie Burke to whom we are most grateful for having stepped into the breach at very short notice. With her on the platform were the Mayor, Councillor Mrs. Qunn, J.P., and the Mayoress, also our M.P. Mr. Ray Gunter and Mrs. Gunter. Councillor A. E. Knight and Mrs. James. Chairman of the Dickens Fair Committee. After a happy speech by Miss Burke selling became brisk at the stalls set up round the hall— each represented a Dickens character or book and was loaded with articles given by local traders and friends of St. Alban's Hall. The gifts included groceries, cakes, bottles, toys, doils, jeweilery and articles of needlework. Upstairs a Fun Fair attracted the children, with games, competitions, sideshows and a bran tub. Refreshments were available and the hotdog stall proved as successful as in past years. This year we had in addition ice cream and hot chestnuts for sale. Throughout the day raffle tickets could be bought for the more valuable gifts received and in the late afternoon the lucky numbers were announced, also the number of the prize-winning 6d. entry programme. The Fair ended with an auction in which the most interesting and valuable item was a leather handbag sent by Her Majesty the Queen Mother who had been approached to open the Fair, She was unable to accept but had expressed her great interest in the welfare of old people and sent this gift with her best wishes. After deduction of expenses the sum of £414 0s. Id. was handed to the Executive Committee for the Comforts Fund. VISITING This plays a most important part in the Welfare State as, thanks to the various Domiciliary Services, many more old persons who otherwise would have been in an Old People's Home are now able to stay in their own accommodation. This in its turn presents a great problem as many of the Old Folk are very frail and infirm and should be visited frequently to ascertain that all is well. One reads daily in the newspapers of old people being found in a collapsed condition, rushed off to hospital and suffering all the consequences of having been left for many hours before receiving any help. Only those who have experienced this can describe the terrible moments of anguish and despair they suffered, when they felt that they had been deserted in their hour of need. Regular visiting could help to minimise the incidence of this situation as the Visitor would observe any -64- signs of deterioration of health, and the necessary information would be passed on to the Health Authorities in good time. Another reason for regular visiting is the fact that many old people have outlived their families and are entirely alone in the world, and if it were not for the visitor from some organisation, they would never sec a new face for months on end. At St. Alban's Hall we are greatly in need of two kinds of Visitors: those prepared to visit an old person or persons regularly and, therefore, willing to join our 'Visiting Committee', and those prepared to give some hours weekly, who could be trained to do 'Case Work' and help deal with the emergency calls for help which are a daily occurrence at the Centre. Let all who read this report accept the challenge of the problem of 'Old Age', for they in turn will be old one day. Let them be prepared to take their part in helping to share the arduous task of those endeavouring to make a better world for the Old Folk of Southwark. FLAG DAY Flag Day was held on Saturday, 7th September, and during that week boxes were sent out to churches, doctors, hospitals and shops who had responded to our appeal. We are grateful to them all for their help and also to Mr. Farmer and the Town Hall staff, to Kennington Rotary, Toe H and Civil Defence. On Flag Day depots were set up in East Street and Westmoreland Road, and many volunteers helped in the street collection. As a result of this concerted effort the considerable total of £203 19s. 8d. was reached. TELEVISION FOR THE HOMEBOUND It is difficult for the normally active to envisage the full implication of life literally within four walls. There is the frustration of spiritual as well as physical imprisonment which leads to stagnation and apathy because there is no possibility of escape and existence seems futile. For some of the homebound books and radio are the panacea of loneliness; some are fortunate in having regular visits from neighbours and relatives; but how many are entirely alone in the world—many more than one imagines—and for whom radio is a remote voice, impersonal because unseen ? to them live pictures would give so much pleasure—they could relive their experiences watching street scenes in familiar sittings and glimpse across the screen famous personalities of the day and characters of history who might otherwise remain just vague names. A coronation, a royal wedding, a military procession. Remembrance Day in the Albert Hall—they would see it all and feel again part of the living world—no longer put aside because of infirmity. Such enjoyment can be within the reach of the homebound through the good offices of British Relay Wireless who are prepared to install sets free, with a token charge of 2/6d. per week for maintenance. Thus for the total sum of £10 10s. Od. per annum including the licence we could supply a set and we appeal to friends to whom activity is a normal way of life to act as sponsors to a homebound person, and bring a measure of happiness into the life of one who has so little, HOLIDAYS In May last year a party of 170 old people spent a fortnight at Bognor Regis and another party of 92 went in September. These holidays were both subsidised by the Borough Council, the old people contributing rather more than half the cost unless they qualified for the special scheme by which they made a token payment of £1 and the balance came from the Mayor's Fund. In September also a group of 40 old people spent a week at Llandudno: this holiday was organised at -65- St. Alban's Hall but the old people went at their own expense. Throughout the year special cases were sent for holidays at convalescent homes, several through the Bermondsey Medical Mission. We have many old people who are now able to go away every year, but we are constantly discovering how many there are in the borough who have not had a holiday by the sea for years, perhaps ever. It is good to feel that we can give them this opportunity of escaping from the smoke and dreariness of the city and their expression of gratitude and appreciation is sufficient reward for the efforts involved. VISITORS The fame of Southwark Old People's Welfare Centre has spread far and wide and as in past years we have had a number of visitors to view the working of the organisation. Among official bodies whom we have welcomed were the Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee, represented by the Mayor and several of its members, and also the Mayor of Lewisham and members of the Council. Other visitors included groups of students from Pakistan. U.S.A. and Malta: also from University College. London, the London School of Economics and the Mary Ward Settlement. Our French friends from Courbevoie, Southwark's twin town, made a welcome visit to St. Alban's Hall, and showed great interest in our schemes for the happiness and well-being of our old people. In December we entertained representatives of the Women's Institute at East Wittering as a small token of our gratitude for their kindness to the pensioners of Southwark. OUTINGS AND ENTERTAINMENTS During the past year our old people have enjoyed a full programme of outings thanks to the kindness of many friends. The Women's Institutes again entertained parties of 35 -40 at Albourne, East Wittering and Plaxtol, and we would express deep gratitude for their unfailing kindness and hospitality. The Lions Club of London South organised two outings to Southsea and gave their guests a wonderful time. We are indeed grateful for their generosity. In addition we joined the National Federation of Old Age Pensioners in expeditions to Hastings and Margate. An outing of special interest was the trip to Cadbury's works at Bournevilie. Our last excursion was in September to see the lights at Southend. On Wednesday evening there has been the usuai series of entertainments organised by Mr. Richardson. After Old Time Dancing, still directed by Miss Hartley and always a prime favourite, there have been whist drives, bingo drives, alternating with dancing displays by children, concert parties, a play presented by Mrs. James and a visit to Duthy Hall to plays given by the St. Christopher Players. CHRISTMAS ACTIVITIES The Annua! Christmas Dinner was held on Wednesday, 18th December, and was much enjoyed by hundreds of old people in the restaurant luncheon clubs and in their own homes served by the Meals-on-Wheels service. There was also a party of specially invited guests at St. Alban's Hall, including members of the Borough Council, who were welcomed by Mrs. Campbell, the Deputy Organising Secretary. Councillor Knight paid tribute to the generosity of the Southwark Rotary -66- in providing turkeys and drinks, also to the efforts of the kitchen staff, headed by Mrs. Regan and Pearce, who had produced such a wonderful meal for such large numbers. The homebound were not forgotten during the two days holiday—packed meals were taken out to them on Christmas Eve. On Saturday, 21st December, a parly was held at St. Alban's Hall for the homebound. Over 100 were brought in by car and ambulance and an entertainment was given by the Choir. Hundreds of parcels were distributed to old people in the borough from the United Africa Company, St. Christopher House, Air India, the London Electricity Board and Kennington Toc H. We are most grateful for their continued support and interest. GENERAL ACTIVITIES Choir. Under the able and inspired conducting of Mr. Irons, the Southwark Old People's Choir has gone from strength to strength this past year. Besides giving great pleasure to audiences at St. Alban's Hall it has visited other centres and has gained first place in the South-East London Music Festival. The singing on the occasion of the visit of the civic authorities of Southwark's twin town aroused the enthusiasm of the guests from Courbevoie from whom they received a tremendous and moving reception. Councillor Farrow and Councillor Mrs. Farrow have presented a silver cup as choir trophy to be competed for among Old People's Choirs in London, and it is hoped that more choirs will be formed in order to make competition interesting.
