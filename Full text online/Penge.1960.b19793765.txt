Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1960. During the year Penge completed sixty years as an Urban District, and almost simultaneously the Boundary Commission recommended the amalgamation of Penge with Beckenham and Bromley as a single unit of local government. On this it is not within my province to comment. As this is the twenty-first Annual Report which I have presented I may, perhaps, be permitted to refer back to one of the earlier years on the subject of diphtheria immunisation. I belong to a generation of doctors to whom, in our younger days, diphtheria was an ever present, worrying and often fatal disease, and it was therefore a pleasure when, in March, 1941, I conducted the first immunisation session held under the auspices of the Penge Council. Some six years later, in spite of the difficult conditions of the war years, it was possible for me to report that no case of diphtheria had occurred in the district. This I consider a convincing proof of the value of immunisation against the disease, and this freedom from cases in the district has now lasted for thirteen years. At times one reads in the National Press of outbreaks in various parts of the country, some of them quite close to Penge, and yet there still remain in the district several hundred children whose parents have not availed themselves of the opportunity to give them protection. Since the early days other diseases have been added to the list where immunisation can be afforded either by their own doctors or through the clinics provided by the Kent County Council. These are whooping cough, tetanus and poliomyelitis. Here again many children are unprotected and in the case of poliomyelitis the response from the age group 15-40 years has been disappointing. The disease can strike at any time and anywhere and therefore the need for immunisation is real and urgent. The Vital Statistics call for little comment, showing as they do little change and conforming closely to the national figures. Again the birth rate is higher than the average and there is a disturbing increase in the number of illegitimate births. Many reasons can be given for this increase, but I feel that basically it reflects the lowering of moral values which is so much in evidence everywhere today. 4 The year has been a busy one in two major matters, namely slum clearance and clean air. The first district chosen as a smokeless zone was inspected and the necessary information collated for submission to the Minister. Several areas were represented to the Council by myself as suitable as clearance areas. During the year also one has been able to see new dwellings completed and occupied on sites dealt with as clearance areas in previous years. Much good work has again been done by various voluntary organisations for the benefit of the aged in the district. Unfortunately again the department has had to deal with a few cases of aged infirm who had to be removed under a Court Order. Again I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to Mr. E. G. Thomas and the staff of the department for much work willingly and cheerfully undertaken by them often out of normal working hours. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (Acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-year 1960 (estimated by Registrar-General) 25,770 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1960 £355,514 Sum represented by 1d. rate £1,434 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the old Crystal Palace the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were 84 men and 14 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Live births 560 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 21.7 Stillbirths 19 Stillbirth rate per 1,000 live and still births 32.8 Total live and still births 579 Total infant deaths 9 5 Infant mortality rates (1) Total infant deaths per 1,000 live births 16.17 (2) Total infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 19.2 (3) Total infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 24.4 Neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 12.5 Early neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 12.5 Peri-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 44.9 Illegitimate live births per cent of the total live births 7.3 Maternal deaths (including abortion) 1 Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 1.8 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 560 compared with 569 in 1959. This gives a crude birth rate of 21.7 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 22.2 for 1959. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local births is 0.91. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 19.6 compared with 20.2 for 1959. Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 19, equal to a rate of 32.8 of 1,000 total births, compared with 18.9 for 1959. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 295, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.4 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.1 for 1959. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.98. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 11.3 compared with 10.78 for the year 1959. The death rate for England and Wales was 11.5 compared with 11.6 recorded for 1959. Deaths among the inmates of an institution for elderly men numbered 13. A large proportion of deaths was of elderly people, and of the total deaths, 202 or 69.5% were of persons 65 years of age and over compared with 69.1% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 40.3% of the deaths compared with 47.3% for 1959. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 58, giving a death rate for Home Population of 2.2 compared with 1.9 for 1959. The rate for England and Wales was 2.157. 6 Tuberculosis There were two deaths from tuberculosis in Penge, giving a death rate of .077. The rate for England and Wales was .075. Maternal Mortality There was one maternal death during the year, giving a death rate of 1.7. The rate for England and Wales was 0.39, compared with 0.38 for 1959. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 9, corresponding to a rate of 16.07 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 19.3 for 1959. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 21.7. Seven of these infants died under one week and there were three deaths from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1960:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Total Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 21.7 32.8 11.4 16.07 England and Wales 17.1 19.7 11.5 21.7 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Board regularly carry out bacteriological examination and chemical analysis. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham the whole of which is culverted. 7 Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse is collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse is taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector.

During the year six bodies were dealt with by the Council under these provisions. Under Section 47 of this Act it was necessary to apply for Magistrates' Orders for the removal of three women in need of care to a hospital. These applications were granted. MORTUARY During the year 17 bodies were brought to the Mortuary where post-mortem examinations were conducted by a Home Office pathologist. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 This Act, which came into operation during the year, provides under Section 1, that noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. This legislation, which was overdue, should contribute to the health of the community in this mechanical age. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for the kindness and consideration they have always shown me during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, B. E.

July, 1961. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I desire to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1960, setting out the work of the Public Health Inspectors. Slum clearance work has occupied a prominent place in the Department's activities during the year. There can be little doubt that this work must continue for some years. Much of the district is ripe for re-development. Houses built 80 or more years ago which comprise a large part of the housing accommodation of the area, are generally speaking worn out and below the standards laid down for fit dwellings. Details of the work carried out and to be carried out will be found within the Report. A year ago in my Report I ventured to draw attention to the need, in my opinion, of powers to deal with houses let in multiple occupation, known as Houses-let-in-Lodgings. It is therefore with some satisfaction that I note the Housing Bill at present before Parliament contains provisions in that behalf which, if and when embodied in an Act, will give the needed powers to secure better standards of housing accommodation in this class of dwelling. In the same report I suggested that the powers of local authorities to require good management of blocks of flats were needed, and it is with regret I observe no provision in this behalf is contained in the Housing Bill. During the year the completion of the survey of the first smokeless zone was carried out with a view to the area contained therein being designated under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956. Complaints numbering 483 (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints were investigated and appropriate action taken where necessary. The amount of work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen set out in the summary of work executed. Every effort is made to secure compliance with the requirements of the department by informal action, but it was unfortunately necessary to take legal proceedings in three cases with the following results:— 16 Case No. 1—Non-compliance with Statutory Notice. Order made to execute necessary works within 28 days. Case No. 2—Non-compliance with Statutory Notice. Order made to execute necessary works within 28 days. Case No. 3—Non-compliance with Statutory Notice. Order made to execute necessary works within 6 weeks. The Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector and myself are always pleased to address meetings of various organisations in the district on the work of the department.

The greater number of these dwellings were in "The Groves" Area. A closing order on one dwelling was determined during the year, and one dwelling provisionally subject to a closing order was demolished. 18 During the year the Minister of Housing and Local Government requested a review by Local Authorities of the housing situation. As a result of a survey made the Minister was informed as follows:— Estimated number of houses remaining unfit for human habitation 437 Estimated period of years necessary to secure the demolition of remaining unfit dwellings 10 Proposals for 5 years ending 1966 Number of houses to be demolished in clearance areas 341 The Survey and Representation of unfit houses has imposed a heavy task on the department which has been carried out by the inspectors with a sense of vocation, and a desire to see people decently housed. In these days when, in so many cases, both husband and wife are at business, much work in this connection has been done after official hours. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out, 1,870 visits being made in this connection. The classification of the various food businesses by type is as follows:— I.

FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1938 Visits paid to factories totalled 207, and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, one written notice was served and complied with. These dealt mainly with insufficient and defective sanitary conveniences and want of cleanliness. Notices were received in respect of 16 Penge residents who were employed in certain trades in their own homes, but working for occupiers of factories in other districts. In no case was it found that work was being done in unwholesome premises. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 Proposed Smoke Control Area No. 1 During the year the survey of Area No. 1 comprising 691 dwellings was completed, and thus it was possible for application to be made to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for his confirmation for the making of the area a Smoke Control Area. 22 It is anticipated that the area will become a Smokeless Zone in 1962. During the survey the staff, with two exceptions, received the co-operation of the residents, and it was possible to report that the making of the area a smokeless zone will be welcomed by its inhabitants. CANAL, BETTS PARK The water in this canal has, from time to time, over a number of years caused anxiety, arising from decomposing vegetable matter, together with material thrown therein and also from the breeding of insects. To deal with the insect problem the water was twice subject to chemical treatment during the summer months, and I am pleased to report that the treatment was successful. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 168 regarding rats and 126 mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. It was found that defective drains and sewers were frequently associated with rat infestations and also that the keeping of animals contributed to the number of rat infestations. Where investigations suggested that defective drains and sewers were associated with rat infestations, the drainage systems were tested and any defects found remedied. As in previous years the foul water sewers were treated on two occasions. In April 141 manholes and side entrances were baited and takes recorded in 18. The figures for the October treatment were 60 manholes baited and takes recorded in 24. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and re-inspections made 2,515 Premises treated for rats 386 Premises where rat poison bait laid 129 Premises subject to post-baiting treatment for rats 247 Premises treated for mice 160 Premises re-treated for mice 40 Number of "block controls" carried out 114 MOVABLE DWELLINGS The camping and caravan site of nearly three acres in the Crystal Palace Grounds, established in 1951 and run by the Caravan Club of Great Britain, continues to be occupied. The site is well managed. Additional toilet facilities were provided during the year. The caravan site is used by visitors to London, an increasing number are from overseas. The period of stay at the site is limited to three weeks. 23 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act came into force on 1st April, 1952, and regulates the sale of pet animals. Licences were granted to three applicants subject to conditions laid down by the Council, these conditions being based on those recommended by the R.S.P.C.A. As indicated in the Report for 1959, the Act is limited in its operation, and in the light of experience could, with advantage, be amended. It gives no control over the management of boarding kennels. SHOPS ACT, 1950 YOUNG PERSONS (EMPLOYMENT) ACT, 1938 Number of visits 286 Number of Sunday patrols carried out 24 Number of evening patrols carried out 45 Number of premises where young persons employed 22 Number of "Mixed" shops where posters relating to Early Closing Day and Sunday trading not exhibited 4 Letters of warning were sent with reference to contravention of the Act relative to the non-exhibition of forms in "mixed" shops when open for Sunday trading, and on the afternoon of early closing day. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952 and HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953 These regulations made it an offence to sell or expose for sale certain heating appliances unless fitted with an effective fireguard as prescribed in the regulations. As a result of this enactment and statutory instrument the tests prescribed on heating appliances exposed for sale in the district were made. Number of tests carried out 11 One appliance tested did not satisfy the requirements of the regulations. I wish to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and assistance during the year, and also to the members of the staff for their valuable assistance in the work of the Department. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. G. THOMAS, Chief Public Health Inspector.
