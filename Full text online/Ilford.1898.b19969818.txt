ILF 44 4 Ilford Urbann Council. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year ending December, 1898. F. MYNOTT, STEAM PRINTER, ILFORD, ROMFORD, AND BRENTWOOD Ilford Urban Council. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the YEAR ENDING DECEMBER, 1898. To the Ilford Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In presenting my report on the sanitary condition and health of the Urban District of Ilford during the year 1898, I beg to say that I estimate the population of the whole district, which includes Ilford, the County of London Lunatic Asylum at Claybury, and Dr. Banardo's village homes at Barkingside, to be 30,978, which is made up as follows:— Ilford 27,178 Claybury Asylum 2,800 Dr. Barnardo's homes 1,000 30.978 2 I estimate the population of Ilford, by adding the estimated population of the year 1897, 21,500, to the excess of births over deaths, 433, and the increase of the population inhabiting the new houses put on the rate book since my last yearly report, 1,049 new houses at 5 persons per house are 5,245, making 27,178. The density of the population of the district, including Claybury Asylum and Dr. Barnardo's homes, is 3 647 persons per acre. The number of deaths from all causes which occurred in the district during the year under consideration was 535, 264 of which were at Claybury Asylum, 7 were at Dr. Barnardo's homes, which leaves 264 for the rest of the district. To these I add the deaths of people who died in the Romford Union who belonged to Ilford, 12 in number, which makes deaths for Ilford itself 276, or at the rate of 10.22 per 1000 per annum of the population. The number of births was 697. There were no births at either Claybury Asylum or Dr. Barnardo's, so that the birth rate for Ilford is 25.646 per 1000 per annum of the population, which is rather less than that of the previous year, which was 29.55 per 1000 per annum of the population. The number of infectious diseases notified during the year was 634, namely: Scarlet fever 74 Diphtheria 66 Typhoid fever 33 Erysipelas 36 Measles 425 634 Six of the cases of Erysipelas were notified from Claybury and were the only infectious ones notified from there. 3 There were no cases reported from Dr. Barnardo's homes, which speaks well for the freedom of the children from infectious diseases during the year. The beginning of the year opened with an epidemic of measles which continued more or less until the end of February, there were some cases through March, April, and May, and then another epidemic began in June and continued through July, the most of the epidemic being in Barkingside ; during the rest of the year a few cases occurred each month. Altogether during the year there were 425 cases, amongst which there were only 5 deaths, which is very small considering the number of cases. The schools at Mossford Green, Horns, and Chadwell, were closed for a time on account of measles, also one private school. Other infectious diseases were not very great, considering the increase in the population. The number of typhoid cases was 33, with 3 deaths. I think, that considering the condition the river Roding was in for some months in the summer time, being practically an open sewer and most offensive, that the inhabitants of Ilford have much to be thankful for, inasmuch as so few extra cases of typhoid were caused by it. Bakehouses have all been kept clean and in a satisfactory condition generally. Burial grounds are properly kept. Cow sheds and slaughter houses are also kept in a sanitary condition. The removal of dust has been carried out satisfactorily for the last six months. 4 Several houses have been put in habitable repair, some closed and some demolished. The houses put in habitable repair are in Laburnum Grove, Railway Terrace, Hainault street, 1st and 2nd Barracks, Green lanes. Three houses in Philpots Court were closed and five pulled down, the order for doing which was obtained in the previous year. Five cottages in Valentines Row were closed and subsequently demolished. Eight houses in White Row, Ley street, were also closed. The condition of the ditches in the district is fairly good with the exception of the one in Bennetts Castle Lane, which I have mentioned in former reports, it is still in a very filthy condition, and may become a source of infectious disease at any time. The sanitary improvements carried out during the year are : The Hospital for infectious diseases, which was opened early in November, and four cases of typhoid fever were removed there from the time it was opened to the end of the year. The outfall works have been reconstructed and seem now likely to be able to deal with the sewage of the district for some time to come. The inhabitants of Ilford were put to great inconvenience in the summer time during the very hot weather, by the break down of the water supply of the " East London Water Company," and the only partial supply of the " South Essex Waterworks Company." Water cress from the beds alongside the river Roding was forbidden to be sold to the public, as the beds had been flooded by the Roding. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES SHIMELD, Medical Officer of Health.

Medical Officers of Health of "Combined Districts" must make a separate Return for the District of each District Council. 2. Medical Officers of Health acting for a portion only of the District of a District Council should write, in the heading of the Table, the designation of the Division for which they act. 3. The words "Urban," "Rural," or " Metropolitan" must be inserted in the appropriate space vti the heading, according as the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The "Localities" adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population ; such as parishes, groups of parishes, townships or wards. As stated at the head of the first column in each Table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 5. The deaths which have to be classified in this Table (A), and summed up in the horizontal line of " Totals," are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, e.g., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which corrections apply, may appear in the text of the report or in supplementary tables.

Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 3.
