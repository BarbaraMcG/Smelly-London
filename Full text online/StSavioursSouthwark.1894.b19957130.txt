The St. Saviour's District comprises the Parishes of St. Saviour and Christchurch, in the County of Surrey, and forms part of the Administrative County of London. The area of the district is 203 statute acres, viz.:— St. Saviour 126 Christchurch 77 Total 203 acres. The population of the District at each of the four decennial periods of the census since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, in the year 1855, is given in the Census Returns, as under:— B 2 4 POPULATION (a.) 1861. 1871. 1881. 1891.

This decrease of population is attributed in the Census Returns to the demolition of houses for the construction of railways, the formation of new streets, and the erection of business premises; the diminution in the number of inhabited houses is due to the same causes, and to the erection of blocks of artizans' dwellings in lieu of the smaller description of houses, each block being counted as one house. Since the Census of 1891, the population of the District has. in consequence of the operation of the Public Health Act of 1891 been further reduced, and, in April, 1894, it was estimated by the Registrar General as under: St. Saviour 11,577 Christchurch 13,032 Total 24,609 5 RATEABLE VALUE (b.) 1893. 1894. 1895.

Oviatt, the Board unanimously re-elected Mr. Frederick Baxter, J.P., to be its Chairman for the year ensuing. On completion of his year of office the following resolution was, on the motion of Mr. Henry J. Coles, seconded by Mr. G. D. Woodcock, unanimously passed:—"That this meeting desires to express its high appreciation of the impartial, courteous, and dignified manner in which the Chairman (Mr. F. Baxter) has presided over the proceedings of the Board during the past year, and hereby tenders him its best thanks for his able and indefatigable services." 10 CHAIRMANSHIP OF COMMITTEES. The several Chairmen of Standing Committees were re-appointed by the Committees at their first meetings after the reception of the returns of newly elected members in June, viz., Mr. Henry J. Coles, Paving and General Purposes Committee; Mr. George J. Newton, Sanitary and Sewers Committee; and Mr. Henry J. Fry, Finance Committee. MEETINGS. During the year 27 meetings of the Board, 28 of the Paving and General Purposes Committee (including sub-committee meetings), 37 of the Sanitary and Sewers, 14 of the Finance, and 7 of Special Committees have been held, a total of 112 meetings of the Board and Committees. ATTENDANCES OF MEMBERS. A list of the Attendances of Members is appended to this report at pages 30 and 31. LONDON (EQUALISATION OF RATES) ACT, 1894. An estimate, based upon the returns of rateable value and of the population at the period of the last census, was published in the last Annual Report (page 13), and it was shown that, according to such returns, St. Saviour's Parish would contribute about £2,858 and Christchurch £365, nett, towards the Metropolitan Equalisation Fund for the then current year. Owing, however, to a large reduction in the population of the district since the census returns were issued, hereinafter referred to, the amount of grant receivable has been less than was anticipated, and the nett contribution of each of the two parishes to the common fund was as under:— £ s. d. St. Saviour 3,328 13 8 Christchurch 463 7 2 equal to a rate of 3.57d and 0.90d in the pound respectively on the rateable value, as shown in the following table:— St. Saviour. Contribution. Grant. Nett Equalisation Charge. Rate in the Pound ½ year to 31 March, 1895 2,788 11 9 1,136 18 6 1,651 13 3 1.77d Ditto to 30 Sept., 1895 2,790 1 3 1,113 0 10 1,677 0 5 1.80 d Totals 5,578 13 0 2,249 19 4 3.328 13 8 3.57d 11 Christchurch. Contribution. Grant. Nett Equalisation Charge. Race in the Pound ½ year to 31 March, 1895 1,520 5 6 1,279 16 3 240 9 3 0.47d Ditto to 3Q Sept, 1895 1,522 2 9 1,299 4 10 222 17 11 0.43d Totals 3,042 8 3 2,579 1 1 463 7 2 0.90d REDUCTION IN POPULATION. For the purposes of the Equalisation of Rates Act, the authority making the poor rate is required to make a return annually of the total number of houses entered in the rate book. Such return has to be forwarded to the Local Government Board, and the Registrar General is then required to make an estimate of the population of each parish on the 6th April in each year. Estimates based upon the returns so forwarded to the Registrar General have been made and published, from which it appears that the population, which, at the time of the census in 1891, stood at 27,177, had been reduced, in April, 1894, to 24,609, a decrease of 9-45 per cent. This diminution in the number of inhabitants is a serious matter for the ratepayers of the district—for those of the parish of St. Saviour more particularly—seeing that the amount of grant receivable out of the equalisation fund is proportioned to the number of inhabitants, while that of the contribution payable depends upon the rateable value, which has a tendency to increase slightly, and it will make a difference of about £550 in respect of the current year. The estimate of the Registrar General will shortly be subjected to verification or correction, inasmuch as the Act requires that a census shall be taken of the number of inhabitants quinquennially, the first to be taken on the night of Sunday, the 29th March, 1896. The exact number will then be ascertained and made known in the form of census returns. SANITARY STAFF. In the last Annual Report (page 22), an extract was presented from the report of the Medical Officer of Health (Mr. Shirley F. Murphy) to the London County Council on the sanitary condition of the district, dated December, 1893, in which he expressed an opinion that two Sanitary Inspectors were insufficient for the district: a copy of the letter which was addressed to the Council in reply thereto in July, 1894, was also published urging that the Board had already in its employ a larger number ot 12 Inspectors in proportion to its population than the great majority of the district boards and vestries in the metropolis. The County Council, however, insisted that another Inspector was necessary, and, yielding to its requirements, the Board, in December last, proceeded to appoint an additional Inspector, and one also in the place of Mr. Samuel Broadhead, who, in consequence of certain irregularities had been called upon to resign. The following were the successful candidates:— Mr. William George Cook, Sanitary Inspector to the Corporation of West Ham. Mr. Joseph E. Johnson, Sanitary Inspector to the Town Council of Kingston-upon-Hull. Mr. Johnson has since resigned, and the Board at the present time has only two Inspectors: having regard to the enormous reduction in the population of the district and the fact that the Board with two Inspectors has in its employ a larger number of Sanitary Inspectors in proportion to the population than the great majority of the other districts in London, it has deferred for the present the question of appointing a successor to Mr. Johnson. The proportion, as compared with other districts in South London, is shown in the following list:— Inhabitants.* St. Saviour, Southwark, one Inspector to 12,301 St. Olave, Southwark 12,723 Bermondsey 26,170 St. George, the Martyr 14,928 Newington 23,160 Rotherhithe 19,627 Lambeth 34,400 Battersea 21,508 Wandsworth 12,072 Camberwell 16,810 Greenwich 18,379 Lewisham 15,441 Woolwich 13,616 Plumstead 13,109 Lee 12,034 An average of one Inspector to 18,141 inhabitants. * Or, if the services of James Barker, who acts as Assistant Inspector, be taken into account, the proportion is one to 8,203 inhabitants. 13 WOOD PAYING. In September, 1894, a deputation, consisting of Messrs. H. H. G. Grattan, Frederick Frank, James Hayward, William Huntley, F. Rand, and J. Wallis attended the Board and requested that the upper portion of the Borough High Street, forming the incline to London Bridge, might be paved with wood, instead of stone, in continuation of the wood pavement already laid down. The application was referred to the Paving and General Purposes Committee and carefully considered. The Committee, however, were of opinion that having regard to the exceptional nature of the traffic and the very considerable extra cost which would be incurred in the maintenance of wood, the Board would not be justified in adopting it, and the site has since been repaved with granite cubes, as originally intended. Towards the cost of these paving works, estimated at £2,037, a loan of £2,000 has been obtained of the London County Council, at 3½ per cent., repayable in ten years by annual instalments of £200. Applications were also received from the Managers of the Orange Street Board Schools for Union Street to be paved with wood, and from the Governors of Newcomen's Schools for the roadway opposite the Schools, which are situate in Newcomen Street, to be similarly paved. The Board informed the Managers of the Board Schools referred to that when Union Street is in need of being repaved their application shall be further considered, and resolved to accede to the request of the Governors of Newcomen's Schools. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. The construction of underground Public Conveniences at the east end of Southwark Street, in lieu of the erection formerly standing on the site, having been completed, the same were opened to the public on the 10th October, 1894. Although availed of to a greater extent than was the previous structure, the financial result thus far, owing to the greatly increased cost of maintenance is far from satisfactory, the half-year's working showing a debit balance of £23 10s. 11d. A detailed statement of the receipts and expenditure for the half-year will be found on pages 76 and 77. The Board some time since resolved to construct similar conveniences at the west end of Southwark Street, at an estimated cost of ,£1,850, such cost including the removal of the large central lamp column at the junction of Southwark Street and Blackfriars Road, and the diversion of electric and other mains rendered necessary for the purpose of the excavations. Application for a loan of £1,750 towards defraying the cost has been made to the London County Council. 14 WORKMEN'S DWELLINGS. In January, 1894, a resolution was, as mentioned in the last Annual Report (page 16) passed expressing satisfaction at the erection, under the auspices of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, of cottage-dwellings for the working classes in Orange Street and other parts of the district, and a hope that the Commissioners would cause suitable dwellings to be erected on a portion of the unoccupied land belonging to them in Union Street. A copy was forwarded to the Commissioners, who, in reply, stated that they had been in communication with the London County Council with a view to arranging a sale of land in Southwark as a site for the erection of such dwellings, but no agreement had been come to. The Board regretting to see so much land eminently well suited for the purpose lying idle and unprofitable, caused a letter to be addressed to the Council upon the subject, urging it to exercise its powers under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, for the erection of cottage dwellings upon the vacant site. In reply, the Council, by letter dated the 16th November. 1894, stated that it was fully alive to the necessity for additional accommodation of the kind in St. Saviour's being provided, and only regretted that the price put by the Commissioners upon the land in Union Street was such as to render it impracticable to acquire the sites offered, unless either the rents were raised above those ruling in the neighbourhood or a charge was made upon the County rate, both of which were contrary to the resolution of the Council. In March last, the Committee having again very carefully considered the matter, caused another letter to be addressed to the Commissioners relative to the negotiations for the purchase of the land, calling their attention to the allegation of the London County Council as above set forth, and urging them to set apart a portion of the land at such a price as would enable the Council to erect suitable dwellings. To this the Commissioners replied in the terms following:— "Ecclesiastical Commission, 10, Whitehall Place, London, S.W. 29th March, 1895. "Dear Sir, "I have submitted to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners your communication of the 22nd instant expressing the views of a Committee of the St. Saviour's District Board of Works with reference to the management of the Commissioners' Southwark estate, and to certain results which the Committee represent as arising from such management. "With regard to the negotiation with the London County Council, to which you refer, the Commissioners direct me to explain that they offered to sell to the London County Council for sites for the erection of workmen's dwellings, three plots of land in Union Street, and that, .having regard to the object for which the Council proposed to acquire 15 the land, they offered it at a price which they were advised was considerably below its value, but the County Council considered two of the plots unsuitable for the purpose; while, for the third plot, embracing an area of about 18,500 square feet, for which the Commissioners asked the reduced price of £7,500, they offered only £3,000, a sum so inadequate that the Commissioners were compelled to decline it, having regard to their position as trustees. "The Commissioners, as you have already been informed, have always kept in view the necessity of making due provision for the housing of the labouring population. And the provision which they have already made for re-housing the displaced tenants of cottages on their Southwark estate was explained in my letter to you of the 28th May, 1892. "The accommodation provided by Stanhope and Mowbray Buildings was, as I then pointed out, in excess of the demand for such accommodation arising out of any action of this Board in dealing with their estate, and this excess still remains. The Commissioners have, moreover, themselves made some limited prevision for workmen's dwellings by the erection of cottages in Orange Street, which are let at moderate rents, and they have now under consideration the advisability of making some addition to their number as circumstances may permit. "I am, dear Sir, "Yours faithfully; "A. DE BOCK PORTER. "W. H. Atkins, Esq., "St. Saviour's District Board of Works. Subsequently a deputation from the Sanitary Committee had an interview with the Secretary to the Commissioners on another subject, at which the correspondence was alluded to, and the deputation was given to understand that the Commissioners were not disposed to modify their offer in any way. RAILWAY SCHEMES. In December last notices were received from the South Eastern Railway Company and the City & South London Railway Company, of intended applications to Parliament for an extension of the time, limited by their Acts of 1890, as extended by those of 1893 respectively, for compulsory purchase of lands and completion of works. The bills not containing any new provisions affecting the district, but only such as already been sanctioned by the Board, the Board resolved not to offer any opposition to the applications. COMBINED DRAINAGE. The Board, as mentioned in the last Annual Report, page 19, appointed Mr. Geo. J. Newton and its Surveyor (Mr. Norrish), delegates, to attend a conference at the Holborn Town Hall, Gray's Inn Road, on the subject of combined drainage; and, on 16 the receipt, in February last, of a communication from the Incorporated Association of Municipal and County Engineers, wrote to the London County Council expressing concurrence with the object which the Association had in view, viz., to induce the Council to take steps to procure an amendment of the law regarding the definition of the words "sewer" and "drain" in the Metropolis Management Acts. In June, a letter was received from the Council stating that a bill had been prepared, but suggesting that the object which the local authorities desired to see given effect to might, without emendation of the definition, be attained by adding after the words "district board" the words "or constructed at the expense of the owner without such order." The suggestion did not, however, meet with general concurrence, most of the local authorities being of the opinion that it would be impossible in many cases to prove that a combined drain had been constructed at the expense of the owner. Several meetings of the conference have since been held and the draft bill is now under consideration by the delegates. THE UNEMPLOYED. In February a circular was received from the Local Government Board, referring to the scarcity of employment which existed in many parts of the country, aggravated as it was then stated to be by the protracted frost; urging local authorities to mitigate the distress by providing work for the classes who do not ordinarily have recourse to Boards of Guardians for relief, and suggesting various kinds of work which the Local Government Board considered would be of a suitable description for the relief of the distress. Suggesting also co-operation between the local authorities and the Boards of Guardians of the Poor, and terminating with a reiteration of the assurance made in a former circular that when the works undertaken were of such a character that the expense might properly be defrayed out of borrowed moneys, the local authorities might rely that their applications for sanction to loans would be promptly dealt with. The circular, which was of a similar description to that received in previous years, was, together with a suggestion that a register of the unemployed should be kept at the Board's Offices, referred to the Paving and General Purposes Committee , and the Committee, after careful consideration, reported their views on the subjects of reference to the Board in the terms following:— REPORT OF PAVING AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE. "1. We have considered the reference respecting the desirability of keeping a Register of the Unemployed at the offices of this 17 Board. We find that the employment given by this Board consists of Paving and Road-making, Sewer-making and Cleansing, Scavenging and Dust-collecting, and the extra work entailed by a fall of Snow. The first two of these items are performed by men employed regularly by this Board, but who, we greatly regret to find, are out of work at the present time, owing to the prolonged frost, although their labours are much required. The Scavenging and Dust-collecting is also done by men regularly employed, and, therefore, there remains only the extra work of clearing away snow, which can be given to persons other than those constantly in our employ, and it is found that immediately following a fall of snow more men apply for work than can be usefully employed ; and even if a register were kept, there would be no time to summon those registered, as, if a snowstorm occurs during the night, the men begin clearing away at three o'clock the following morning. "We also learn from employers in the district that such a register would be useless to them, and workmen who apply at the offices of the Board have stated that their names have been entered on many such registers without any useful result. "While, therefore, we have the fullest sympathy with every effort to relieve the present distress, and would be prepared to spare no pains to assist in that direction, we are decidedly of opinion that not only would no relief result from opening such a register, but it would only add another disappointment to the sufferings which too many of our fellow parishioners unfortunately have to bear. "2. We have had before us the Circular received from the Local Government Board, dated February 11th, 1895, on the subject of the Unemployed, which appears to be a repetition of those received on previous occasions. "In that Circular it is suggested that this Board should assist the Unemployed by providing— " '1. Work which will not involve the stigma of pauperism. " '2. Work which all can perform whatever may have been their previous avocations. " '3. Work which does not compete with that of other labourers at present in employment.' "And further sets forth that— " 'These works may be of the following kinds among others. " 'Cleansing of streets not usually undertaken by local authorities, C1 18 " 'Laying out and paving of new streets, &c. " 'Paving of unpaved streets, and making of footpaths in country roads. " 'Spade husbandry on sewage farms. " 'Laying out of open spaces, recreation grounds, new cemeteries, or disused burial grounds. " 'Providing or extending sewerage works and works of water supply.' "We would point out among other impracticabilities that of all the classes of work above enumerated not one can be carried out in frosty weather, which is the season in which the greatest number of men are out of employment, and also that this Board, and probably most other similar bodies, have a large number of workmen who carry on many of the works suggested above in suitable weather, but who are now enduring considerable hardships through the frost preventing their working, and who will need all the employment that can be given to them when the weather breaks. "Secondly, much of the above work requires skilled labour of its peculiar kind, and all of it much physical effort, and is, therefore, totally unfit for those whose infirmities prevent their doing continuous laborious work, and who form such a large proportion of the unemployed in periods of depression, and the employment of men who are unable to do the work allotted to them not only partakes of inhumanity, but their exposure in the public thoroughfares will be likely in some cases to arouse indignation, and in others promote reactionary feelings in those ratepayers who notice their incapacity. "With reference to the clause relating to loans, the Committee would remind the Board of their unfortunate experience with regard to the underground Convenience in the Borough. This work was put in hand in November, 1893, before the plans were complete, in order to find employment, when the weather permitted, during the worst season of the year; and, although a large number could not be employed on the work, yet the proportion to our population was equal to giving 4,000 extra men work throughout the Metropolis, or providing food and warmth for about 20,000 persons. Sanction for a loan was applied for to the Local Government Board on December 6th, 1893, but no Inspector was sent to the District until March, 28th, 1894, and the sanction was not obtained until April 10th, 1894. As the Board does not keep large balances, considering that the ratepayers are the proper custodians of their own money, the greatest possible inconvenience was experienced in finding money to carry on the regular works of the Board. 19 "When this Circular was first issued the Local Government Board doubtless considered that Vestries and District Boards could find work in the direction suggested, but very slight enquiry, at least as regards the Metropolis, would have dissipated that idea long since. "Altogether disregarding the inferred lack of sympathy with the Unemployed on the part of Vestries and District Boards, which the continued issue of this Circular implies, and the unpleasantnesses from which these bodies have suffered when in response thereto employment was not forthcoming, we feel that to arouse illusory hopes in the minds of those bowed down by suffering and privation, by leading them to think that relief in the form of employment would ensue in the manner suggested by this Circular, when only disappointment could result, is adding another and most acute sorrow to the almost unbearable burdens of too many of our fellow citizens. "We therefore recommend that this Board should most respectfully represent to the Local Government Board, that while they (the Board), would only be mos*- grateful for any practical proposals or suggestions which would tend towards the relief of the unemployed, they consider those contained in the present Circular utterly futile—at least as regards the Metropolis—and recommend its withdrawal. We also recommend that a copy of this Report be sent to the Member for West Southwark; and that copies be sent to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, requesting them to memorialise the Local Government Board and their Local Members to the same effect." The Report was adopted by the Board; and, in accordance with the recommendation contained in the concluding paragraph, a letter was addressed to Mr. Causton, M.P., and the several Vestries and District Boards of the metropolis; copies were also forwarded to the member of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the distress from want of employment, then sitting. A large number of the Vestries and several members of the Select Committee wrote, in reply, expressing concurrence with the views expressed in the report. COUNTY COUNCIL ELECTIONS. On the receipt, in February last, of a letter from the Secretary of the Southwark Liberal and Radical Association protesting against the plan adopted as to the counting of the votes and declaration of the poll at the previous County Council Election, and urging that the result of the poll should be declared within the district of West Southwark, the Board adopted a similar resolution, adding that, in its opinion, the deputy returning officer should be chosen from within the district. A copy of such resolution was forwarded to the London County Council C 2 20 TELEPHONES. An application having been received from the National' Telephone Company, Limited, for permission to lay down cables on the east side of the Southwark Bridge Road, from Southwark Bridge to Marshalsea Road, the Board consented, subject to the Company agreeing to pay a rental of £50 per annum to the Board for the concession. An agreement, bearing date the 18th day of March, 1895, has been entered into accordingly. TRAIN SERVICE. On receipt of a circular letter from the Vestry of Battersea stating that that Vestry had had under consideration the question of securing a cheaper train service on the lines of the various railway companies, and asking the Board to appoint delegates to ittend a conference on the subject, the Board appointed Messrs. Ernest Collard and A. R. Layman as delegates accordingly.^ DOORKEEPER. The Board being desirous of superannuating, on the ground of old age, Henry Young, the doorkeeper, who had been in its service for about 19 years, due notice was given to j the Members of the Board, as required by the Superannuation Act of 1866, and, on the 3rd of April, 1895, it was unanimously resolved to grant him a pension of £24 14s. per annum for the remainder of his life, such amount being in accordance with the scale laid down by the Act. Robert MacLeod, who had been house porter at the Shoreditch Infirmary, was afterwards appointed1 to fill the vacancy. UNION STREET. In April an offer was received from Messrs. Clutton, on behalf of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to give up for public uses a strip of land on the north side of Union Street, if the Board would pave the same, and it has consented to do so. The effect will be to make the street 40 feet wide for a length of about 240 feet opposite the Board Schools. ELECTION OF AUDITORS. Pursuant to the requirement in that regard of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Board, in April last, balloted for Auditors to audit the accounts of the Board for the year 1894-95, and the following were chosen, viz.:— St. Saviour. Mr. D. H. Gaskain, Calvert's Buildings, hop factor. Mr. F. H. Hendrichs, 46, Bankside, cullet merchant. Christchurch. Mr. W. Robertson, 210, Blackfriars Road, pawnbroker. 21 BLACKFRIARS ROAD. The Board, in May last, expressed its concurrence with the following resolution; passed by the Vestry of Christchurch:— "That the attention of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis be called to the inconvenience arising from the stopping of omnibuses opposite the tramway terminus in the Blackfriars Road, and generally to the congested state of the traffic at the tramway terminus. and a letter was written to the Commissioner in support of the application. A resolution, also passed by the same Vestry, requesting the Board to take steps to increase the number of lamps at the junction of Stamford Street and Blackfriars Road, was deferred until after the alterations consequent upon the construction of underground public conveniences at the spot shall have been carried out. SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION EXPENSES. On receipt of a circular letter from the Vestry of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, forwarding copy of a report, which the Vestry had adopted relative to tne expenses in connection with School Board Elections, urging the necessity of a proper audit of accounts and pointing out certain anomalies in regard to the charges of the returning officers, the communication was referred to the Finance Committee for consideration, and, on the Committee's recommendation, a letter was addressed to the Committee of Council on Education in support of the Vestry's application. As a result of the representations made to them by the local authorities, the Education Department have issued an order, dated the 31st May, 1895, establishing a revised scale of charges and allowances, under which the maximum fee of the returning officer will be £50 in lieu of ,£105 as formerly, and making the Registrars of County Courts responsible for the taxation of bills of charges in cases of dispute. TRAM FARES. In May an intimation was received from the South London Tramways Company that the Company had resolved that in future no increase should be made on Bank Holidays in the fares charged for the use of the tramway lines under their control. The Board caused a letter to be written expressing its satisfaction at the announcement. PEPPER STREET. Also in May a letter was received from the London County Council stating that, owing to the rebuilding of a house in Pepper Street, abutting on the entrance to the chief station of the Fire 22 Brigade from that street, the entrance gates were not in a line with the party wall of the house in question; suggesting that the gap should be filled up, and enquiring whether the Board would agree to the gates being moved and placed in a line with the party wall of the cottage. The Board, in consideration of the object in view, consented to the enclosure by the County Council of the small strip of land involved in the proposal. BURROW'S MEWS. On the recommendation of the Paving and General Purposes Committee, the Board, in June last, resolved to serve notice upon the owners and occupiers of premises in Burrow's Mews, Blackfriars Road, requiring them to contribute pro rata, according to the extent of their several holdings, the amount, estimated at £455 13s, 6d., of paving, with 4" x 4" granite cubes, the roadway of the Mews, the existing pavement being in such a state as to be dangerous to the traffic and a nuisance to the inhabitants. Notices have accordingly been served upon the responsible persons. NELSON SQUARE. In June also, the Board, on the motion of the Rev. W. Jeliie, resolved to water the roadway of Nelson Square, Blackfriars Road, temporarily, as a matter of emergency, the condition of the same being considered dangerous to the public health and a nuisance; and, on receipt of a memorial from inhabitants of the Square, it consented to such watering being continued pending a report from the Paving and General Purposes Committee, to whom the matter was referred. Furthermore, Mr. W. Carter having suggested that Nelson Square should be dealt with as regarded the paving in the same manner as was intended in the case of Burrow's Mews, it was resolved to refer the whole matter to that Committee with instructions to carry out the suggestion. The Committee have accordingly instructed the Surveyor to prepare an estimate of the cost and plan of apportionment preparatory to the service of notices upon the owners and occupiers. ENCROACHMENT, EWER STREET. The attention of the Board having been called to the erection by Messrs. Arnold Goodwin &: Son, of a fence enclosing a small piece of land on the west side of Ewer Street, nearly opposite the Public Baths, the Board, believing the land to be public property, called upon Messrs. Goodwin to remove the fence and restore the land. They, however, declined to do so and the Board has resolved to take the necessary legal proceedings to compel them. The proceedings will take the form of an injunction to restrain them from occupying the land. 23 POND YARD. The Paving and General Purposes Committee have had' before them on several occasions a proposal by Mr. A. Waterman, on behalf of Mr. N. Fortescue, a contractor and wharfinger, for the stopping up and discontinuance of the right of way through Pond Yard, Bankside, and an offer on his part to pay the Board £100 if the Board would apply to the Court of Quarter Sessions for the necessary order for so doing. In reply, the Committee instructed the Surveyor to inform Mr. Waterman that, in the event of his client undertaking to make the suggested application they would recommend the Board to give its consent thereto, subject to the payment of the sum of 100 as proposed. Mr. Waterman consented to the amended terms, and thereupon the Committee, believing the place to be a nuisance and the right of way of very little use, recommended the Board to accede to the proposal and give Mr. Waterman its assistance in support of the application. The matter came before the Board on the 26th June, and the recommendation of the Committee was unanimously adopted. Subsequently, however, a memorial was received from: owners of property in the locality objecting to the proposal, and expressing their intention to oppose any application to the Justices for stopping up the right of way; the matter was referred back to the Committee for further consideration, and on the 20th July, they reported as follows:— "REPORT OF THE PAVING AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE. "We have carefully considered the memorial respecting the proposed termination of the right of way through Pond Yard. "The earliest record of the Board respecting Pond, Yard is dated 1856, and is as follows:— " 'Pond Yard is private property, used only by foot passengers, the tenants of the adjoining property claiming and using the carriageway.' "It is in close proximity and runs parallel to Emerson Street,, its average distance being 31 yards from that street. "The portion to be closed extends from Skin Market Place to Bankside and over this distance are distributed three irregular and disconnected pieces of foot paving which the Board have kept in repair. One of these, about 20 feet long by 3 feet 6 ins. wide, is situated on the west side of the carriage-way, and the other two, which are 40 feet and 60 feet long respectively, and vary in width from 4 feet to 2 feet 6 inches wide, are on the east side thereof. 24 "In the year 1890, the attention of the Board was called to Pond Yard in consequence of certain obstructions therein, and the matter was referred to the Committee for enquiry. The Board's records show that it was always thought unadvisable to take any definite action in regard thereto, and, on the 2nd December in that year, the Committee reported that they had carefully considered the question of the right of way and were of opinion that the matter had better stand over until application was made to the Board for building on the adjacent property. Such report was unanimously adopted by the Board and nothing further occurred until the recent proposal on behalf of Mr. Fortescue. "We entirely fail to see that terminating this right of way can be injurious to the adjoining property, or cause any depreciation of rates. On the contrary we are decidedly of opinion that advantage would accrue from the cessation of the nuisance resulting from the existence of such a narrow and isolated thoroughfare and the evils which unfortunately seem inseparable from such places. "We further consider that it is entirely valueless to the inhabitants of Bankside from a commercial point of view, being a right of way for foot passengers only, and for these, Emerson Street is so close and so preferable in every way that they can suffer little or no inconvenience from its being closed, nor, considering the proximity of the above street, could we recommend that any public money should be spent on its widening. "We also most emphatically state that we consider it would be entirely in the interests of good order and morality that the right of way should be terminated, whether it were to exist in its present condition or be transformed into a narrow passage about 200ft. long by 3ft. or 4ft. wide, and walled up on either side. "With reference to the £100 to be received. As the Board are not the freeholders of public thoroughfares, much less of rights of way over private property belonging to individuals, but only custodians thereof for the purposes of maintenance, lighting and cleansing, no power to sell this right of way is vested in the Board, and, therefore, the Board cannot accept money for what does not belong to them, nor has any question or idea of sale ever been entertained by us. "further, with reference to the £100. When Mr. Fortescue approached us asking us on behalf of the Board to define the position and limits of the right of way, we having regard to the abominations of the place, suggested that he should make a proposal for closing it. In reply to this, Mr. Fortescue offered £100 if the Board would approve of his application to the 25 Justices for closing it, and we recommended the Board to accept the sum named on the grounds that as the Ratepayers had expended some amount of money in paving and lighting the Yard, and as some of the Officials' time would be occupied on the matter, the Ratepayers were entitled to a return of their expenditure under these heads. "As the Board were not applying for powers to close the way there was no ground on which it could serve notices on the adjoining owners; this the applicant must necessarily do, neither will the Board be affected in any way by the opposition, whether successful or otherwise. "We therefore, after careful reconsideration of the whole subject in the light of the information available and of facts as they exist, and also of the memorial which has been presented, most unhesitatingly recommend the Board to adhere to its resolution of the 26th ulto. on the subject." On the 24th July, on the matter again coming before the Board, the Board declined, by a large majority, to adopt the recommendation of the Committee, and passed a resolution directing the Committee to have the obstructions in the carriageway removed. Attention having been called to the fact of the resolution of the 26th June being still in existence, a special meeting was convened for the 31st July for the purpose of rescinding the same, when nine members voted for and six against the rescission. A majority of two-thirds of the members present not having been obtained, the motion was lost, and thus the matter stands. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, and the Capital and Counties Electric Supply Company, Limited, have respectively given notice of their intention to apply to the Board of Trade for a provisional order under the Electric Lighting Acts to authorise them to supply electricity for public and private purposes within the St. Saviour's district. FINANCES. In consequence of appeal to Quarter Sessions, the rateable value of the Parish of St. Saviour, shown in the Valuation Lists which came into force on the 6th April, 1891, was in 1894, reduced from £224,255 to £220,775, the relative proportion of the sums levied and leviable on the Parishes of Christchurch and St. Saviour being thereby altered, and it became necessary to issue a precept to the 26 Overseers of Christchurch in order to rectify the same. A supplementary precept was accordingly issued, calling upon them to contribute the following sums:— In respect of the year 1891-92 Sewer Rate £ General Purposes Rate 47 £51 In respect of the year 1892-93 Sewer Rate 6 General Purposes Rate 56 62 In respect of the year 1893-94 Sewer Rate 7 General Purposes Rate 47 54 In respect of the year 1894-95 Sewer Rate 7 General Purposes Rate 54 61 £228 The sums so raised have been paid over to St. Saviour's Overseers. In order to meet the estimated expenditure for local purposes during the financial year ending on the 25th March, 1896, and the precepts of the School Board for London for the same period, the following demands by precept have also been made upon the Overseers, viz:— General Purposes Account. St. Saviour £10,422 Christchurch 5,686 £16,108 Sewers Account. St. Saviour £1,731 Christchurch 944 £2,675 Education Account St. Saviour £10,690 3 11 Christchurch 5,830 5 6 £16,520 9 5 The attention of the Board having been called by its Finance Committee to the enormous increase in the demands of the 27 School Board for London, it was, at the meeting of the Board held on the 7th instant, resolved to write to the School Board protesting against the same, and the following letter has been addressed to it accordingly:— "Board of Works for the St. Saviour's District, Emerson Street, Bankside, Southwark, S.E. 9th August, 1895. "Dear Sir, "I am in receipt of a precept from the School Board for London requiring payment of the sum of £9,042 18s. 1d. for defraying the expenses of the School Board in this district during the ensuing half year. "The attention of this Board has been called by its Finance Committee to the constantly increasing demands of the School Board, and to the fact that the precept referred to will necessitate an increased rate of about 1½d. in the pound. "This Board desires to protest in the strongest terms against the enormous increase, the hurden upon the ratepayers being most serious and oppressive, and to suggest to the School Board the necessity of its taking steps to reduce the expenditure in the future. "The Finance Committee (who have carefully considered the matter) are of opinion that greater economy might be exercised by the School Board in several particulars, e.g., in the salaries paid to the head teachers, and by reducing the number of subjects, not absolutely necessary for the purposes of elementary education or contemplated when the Act was passed, which are taught in the schools. "My Committee are of opinion that unless something be done to check and limit the expenditure a reaction will ensue which will be detrimental to the cause of popular education in the metropolis. "I have to request that you will be good enough to submit this letter to the School Board at the earliest opportunity and that you will apprise me of any decision which it may come to in the matter. "Yours faithfully, W. H. ATKINS, Clerk. G. H. Croad, Esq., B.A., Clerk, School Board for London. Copies of the letter were also forwarded to the Committee of Council on Education and the Member for Southwark (Mr. Causton), also to the several Vestries and District Board of Works of the metropolis, asking them to address a similar letter to the School Board or take such other action as they might be advised, with the object of bringing about a reduction in the expenditure. 28 The progressive increase in the demands of the School Board for London is shown in the following STATEMENT of Sums levied in the St. Saviour's District by the School Board for London since its establishment in the year 1870, and of the charges of the ReturningOfficer for the Expenses of the triennial Elections.

Lastly there remains to be recorded the death, in January last, of Mr. John Rawle, which sad event occurred on the 10th of that month. The Board, on the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Henry Ridley, ordered that a letter should be addressed to Mr. Rawle, Junr., expressing the high esteem in 29 which Mr. John Rawle had been held, its regret at the loss of his valuable services, and its sincere condolence with the family of the deceased. In February the death occurred of Mr. Thomas Back, who had been a member of the Board since the year 1888, and in his case also a resolution of condolence was, on the motion of the Rev. W. Jellie, passed and forwarded to the widow and family of the deceased. W. H. ATKINS. Board Room, Emerson Street, Bankside, S.E., August, 1895. 30 31 APPENDIX ATTENDANC ???MEMBERS.

For the year ending Lady day, 1895. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Twelfth Annual Report on the various matters connected with the departments under my control for the year ending Lady-day last. The system which we now adopt of carrying out the whole of our Scavenging, Dusting, Paving, Drainage, and other works by men directly employed by the Board, entails a considerable increase of work and responsibility upon myself and the staff under me, but having direct control over the workmen, enables us to more efficiently perform the duties of each department than under the old contract system. PAVING DEPARTMENT. The policy of abolishing the Macadam roads in the district, is still being steadily pursued, a few only now are left, and these it is to be hoped will soon be replaced by Asphalte or Hardwood paving, the beneficial effects of the adoption of a clean and impervious material for paving is already to be seen in Christchurch, where so many Macadam roads existed, it was formerly almost impossible to keep the roads even moderately clean, whilst they can now, with a minimum amount of work, be kept in proper condition. The following are the principal Carriageway and Footway Paving works executed during the year:— WHITECROSS STREET. The carriageway of this thoroughfare has been paved with a thickness of 1½ inches of Compressed Rock Asphalte, on a foundation 6 inches thick of Portland Cement Concrete, whilst the footways have been paved with York Stone. This street is much used, Red Cross Hall being situate here as also a number of small dwelling-houses, the sanitary condition of the 33 fare is a great improvement on its former state. The area of carriageway paved was about 703 superficial yards, and the footway 1,569 feet, superficial. The original paving was granite pitching. CHARLOTTE STREET. The carriageway of this thoroughfare, which connects Blackfrairs Road with Gravel Lane, has been laid with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a Portland Cement foundation, it was originally intended to pave this street with Jarrah wood paving blocks, but eventually Asphalte was decided upon. The area paved was 1,997 yards, superficial, the street was previously paved with granite pitching. GEORGE STREET. This thoroughfare extends from Blackfrairs Road to Bear Lane, and had a Macadam roadway, this has been removed, the gradients of the Street altered and improved, and the carriageway paved with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a Portland Cement Concrete foundation, the area paved was about 1,447 superficial yards. The footways on the North and South sides of the street were also put in thorough repair, the curb redressed and refixed and the York flagging taken up, resquared, relaid and new supplied where necessary. HATFIELD STREET. This thorougfare which extends from the South side of Stamford Street to Broadwall was originally paved with Macadam, this has now been removed and the street paved with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a foundation of Portland Cement Concrete. The footways were also relaid and repaired where necessary; the area of the carriageway paved was about 1,169 yards superficial. BOUNDARY ROW. This Macadam street which runs from Blackfriars Road westward to Marlboro' Street has now been paved with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a Concrete foundation; the York footways have also been resquared and relaid and the curb refixed. Area of carriageway about 467 yards superficial. GREY STREET (portion of). That part of the above street within the St. Saviour's District has been paved with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a Concrete foundation; the footways have also been repaired. Area of carriageway paved about 29 yards superficial. D I 34 MARLBOROUGH STREET. This Macadam street which runs from Great Charlotte Street in a southerly direction to its junction with Boundary Row, has now been paved with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a Concrete foundation; the curb has also been refixed and the York paving resquared and relaid. Area of carriageway paved about 772 yards superficial. QUEEN STREET (portion of). That portion of the above street within the St. Saviour's District has been paved with Compressed Rock Asphalte on a Cement Concrete foundation; the footways have also been relaid. Area of carriageway paved about 89 yards superficial. TOOLEY STREET. That portion of the above street which lies between St. Olave's boundary and the west side of London Bridge has been repaved with redressed Granite Pitching on a new foundation of 6 inches of Lias Lime Concrete ; the footways on either side were also paved with new York paving, and in consequence of the rough usage to which the footway is subjected at this spot, paving of extra thickness was laid. Area of carriageway paved about 293 yards superficial, and of footway about 1,102 feet superficial. BANKEND. Important alterations in the lines of frontage have been made here. By an arrangement with the South Eastern Railway Co., certain portions of their property have been thrown into the public way in exchange for land which has been given up, the result has been to widen the entrance to Clink Street and Bankend The whole of the old Granite Pitching has been removed and and replaced by redressed Granite, which was laid on a new foundation of Lias Lime Concrete 8 inches in thickness. The footways were also put in thorough order, new curb and York paving being substituted for the old where necessary. Area of carriageway paved about 795 yards superficial. SURREY ROW. This thoroughfare, the carriageway of which was Macadam, has been paved with redressed Granite Pitching throughout its whole length from Gravel Lane to Blackfriars Road; the pitching was laid on a new Lime Concrete foundation 6 inches in thickness. The footway has been paved with new 2½ inch York paving; a large quantity of new and redressed Curb has also been laid. Area of carriageway paved about 1,149 superficial yards. 35 Statement showing the weight of Refuse disposed of in each month during the year:— Market. Dust. Slop. 1894 Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Tons. Dwts.

The work in this department has much increased, the number of new connections to the public sewers, which have been laid by the Board's workmen, being considerably above that of the previous year. The recent legal decisions as to the meaning of the words sewer and drain, and the liability now thrown upon Vestries and District Boards to maintain and be responsible for drains which were laid by private owners, and which were never at the time they were constructed intended to be called public sewers, has already cost this Board a considerable sum of money, many connections having been put in at the expense of the ratepayers instead of the owners of the property. BROADWALL BOUNDARY SEWER. The arrangements which have been for so long settling for abolishing, in conjunction with the Lambeth Vestry, the old Broadwall Boundary Sewer are practically completed, and I hope shortly to get this Board's share of the work done. Nearly every house is now connected to the new low-level sewer in Broadwall. 44 SURREY ROW BOUNDARY SEWER. We have in conjunction with the Vestry of St. George the Martyr abolished and filled up the old high-level boundary sewer which formerly ran in the rear of the houses on the south side of Surrey Row, and which used to discharge westward into Blackfriars Road sewer and eastward into Gravel Lane. The new deep 15-in. and 12-in. pipe sewer in Surrey Row takes all the drainage of the premises on either side. BURROW S MEWS. The old and defective brick sewer which existed has now been replaced by a new 9-in. pipe sewer, which discharges into the Board's sewer in John Street West. Manholes have been built and new gullies constructed, and all pipes have been disconnected from the old sewer which has been filled up and abolished. The length of the new pipe sewer is 285 feet. GREEN DRAGON COURT. An old brick sewer which received the drainage of several houses which were built directly over it has been abolished and a new pipe sewer under the public way substituted. The new sewer discharges into the low-level sewer in Bedale Street. CONCRETE FLUSHING TANKS.

We have also a brick flushing tank in St. Margaret's Court, and this is used periodically. In addition to these tanks we have our river Penstocks and Hydrants. 45 The following is a list of works executed in this District for which Licences have been obtained:— Pulling down buildings 6 Alterations and repairs to ditto 17 Rebuilding 3 Constructing Crossings 4 New buildings 9 Raking Shores 1 Licences 4 44 PRIVATE DRAINAGE CONNECTIONS.

GEO. ROPER NORRISH, August, 1895. Surveyor. 46 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report for the year ending December, 31st, 1894. During the year under consideration the number of births in the St. Saviour sub-district amounted to 368, of which 197 were males and 171 females. In the Christchurch sub-district the total number was 402, 206 being males and 196 females. In the combined districts the grand total thus became 770, of which 403 were males and 367 females. During the same period the number of deaths registered in the St. Saviour sub-district was 192, in the Christchurch subdistrict 186, while 197 deaths occurred outside the district of persons belonging thereto, making a total of 575 in all. From this number 24 must be deducted, being the number of deaths occurring within the district of persons not belonging to it, leaving 551 as the corrected total. The death-rate, therefore, for the combined districts, having an estimated joint population of 24,609, is 22.43 per 1,000, or a corrected death-rate of 23.48 per 1,000. This, however, hardly presents a just view of the deathrate, as in 38 cases the person whose death was recorded came from a common lodging-house, and probably spent but a few days in the district before being sent to the Infirmary. If these cases were deducted the death-rate would be only 20.82 per 1,000 or a corrected death-rate of 21.78 per 1,000. Tabulating these deaths with regard to age it will be found that 114 died under the age of one year, 124 between the ages of one and five years, 23 between the ages of five and 15 years, 25 between the ages of 15 and 25 years, 18 between the ages of 25 and 65 years, and 77 of 65 years upwards. 47 The following classification represents the deaths in the district:— 1.—ZYMOTIC. In St. Saviour's. a. Measles.—16 males and 11 females died from this disease, 7 being under one year of age, and 19 between one and five years. In Christchurch.—11 males and 5 females, 5 being under one year, and 9 between one and five years. In outlying districts, 1 death under one year belonged to Christchurch. b. Scarlet Fever. —2 males and 2 females, belonging to St. Saviour, died in outlying institutions. c. Pertussis.—4 females died in St. Saviour, 2 males and 2 females in Christchurch, and 1 female, belonging to Christchurch, in outlying institutions. d. Diphtheria.—1 male and 1 female in St. Saviour succumbed to this disease, 2 males and 1 female in Christchurch, while in outlying institutions, 4 male and 6 female deaths were attributed to St. Saviour, and 2 male and 2 female to Christchurch. e. Typhoid.—1 male belonging to St. Saviour died in an outlying institution. f. Erysipelas.—1 death occurred in Christchurch Workhouse, and 2 belonging to Christchurch, outside the district. g. Membranour Croup.—1 death occurred in the Christchurch district. h. Puerperal Fever.—1 death occurred in St. Saviour. i. Syphilis.—1 death in St. Saviour, 1 in an outlying institution, belonging to St. Saviour, and 2 in Christchurch were attributed to this disease. k. Diarrhœa.—1 death occurred in Christchurch and 2 belonging to St. Saviour took place in out-lying institution. I. Anthrax.—1 death belonging to Christchurch occurred in an outlying institution. 48 2.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES a. Rheumatism.—1 death occurred in St. Saviour, and 1 in Christchurch. b. Cancer.—1 male and 4 females died in St. Saviour, and 1 male and 7 females in Christchurch, while 6 persons died in outlying institutions, of whom 1 belonged to St. Saviour and 5 to Christchurch. c. Tabes Mesenterica.—1 male and 2 females in St. Saviour, and 1 male and 2 females in Christchurch owed their death to this disease. d. Phthisis.—The deaths from Phthisis were divided as follows:—St. Saviour, 12 males and 7 females; Christchurch, 13 males and 14 females; outlying St. Saviour, 9 males; outlying Christchurch, 20 males and 5 females. e. Purpura.—1 case belonging to Christchurch succumbed in an outlying institution. 3. DEVELOPMENTAL. a. Old Age.—4 deaths in St. Saviour, 2 in Christchurch, and 6 in outlying institutions were due simply to decay of nature. b. Premature Birth.—5 deaths from this cause were recorded in Christchurch, 3 in St. Saviour, and 1 in an outlying institution belonging to St. Saviour. 4. LOCAL DISEASES. a. Nervous System.—8 males and 9 females in St. Saviour, 6 males and 6 females in Christchurch, and in outlying institutions belonging to St. Saviour 3 males and 3 females, and to Christchurch 14 males and 4 females died from these diseases. b. Circulatory System.—The following deaths were recorded:—In St. Saviour, 3 males and 7 females; in Christchurch, 6 males and 5 females; in outlying institutions, 16 males and 3 females. c. Respiratory System.—26 males and 31 females in St. Saviour, 20 males and 20 females in Christchurch, and in outlying institutions 4 males 49 and 5 females belonging to St. Saviour, and 17" males and 4 females belonging to Christchurch died from diseases of the Respiratory System. d. Digestive System.—In St. Saviour 5 deaths, in Christchurch 8 deaths, and in outlying institutions 9 deaths were recorded. e. Urinary System.—These were divided as follows:— In St. Saviour, 3 males and 3 females; in outlying institutions belonging to St. Saviour, 4 males and 2 females; in outlying institutions belonging to Christchurch, 4 males and 1 female. f. Diseases of Bones.—1 case in St. Saviour and 1 in an outlying institution belonging to St. Saviour ended fatally. 5. VIOLENCE. In St. Saviour, 10 deaths; in Christchurch, 9 deaths;, and in outlying institutions 16 deaths were due to violence. The remaining deaths were due to causes which cannot be tabulated owing to the ill-defined nature of the certificates. In combination with the above table of deaths, the following tabulated statement of infectious diseases notified within this district, with number of cases removed to hospital will prove instructive.

This has been chiefly due to the careful carrying out of the provisions of the Public Health Act of 1891. It is a matter of congratulation that so many insanitary dwellings have been closed, but, on the other hand, it has unfortunately entailed a great deal of inconvenience, to use no stronger term, on those who have been displaced from these houses; and unless steps are taken to supply some dwellings for the working classes in the district, the work of depopulation must go on. When we look at the large amount of ground lying vacant, some of it for years, it seems a pity that no means can be devised to erect suitable and healthy dwellings thereon. This matter has frequently engaged the attention of your Sanitary Committee, but the very high, not to say prohibitive, prices asked for ground suitable for the purpose are such as to make it absolutely impossible to construct dwellings which would be within the means of the artisan or unskilled labourer. INQUESTS. In St. Saviour district inquests were held on the bodies of 16 persons, 7 of whom did not belong to the parish. The following verdicts were returned:— Found drowned 6 Convulsions 3 Suicide, Drowning 1 „ Hanging 1 Apoplexy 1 Electric Shock 1 Accidentally Suffocated in bed 1 Heart Disease 1 Haemorrhage into Lung 1 In Christchurch district inquests were held on 14 bodies, 7 of which did not belong to the district. The following verdicts were returned:— Drowned 4 Suicide by Drowning 1 Heart Disease 3 Accidentally Suffocated in bed 2 Pneumonia 1 Electric Shock 1 Apoplexy 1 Tuberculosis 1 E 2 52 Inquests were also held in other districts on the bodies of 20 persons, 9 of whom belonged to Christchurch and 11 to St. Saviour, with the following verdicts:— Run over 4 Drowned 3 Fracture of Skull 2 „ Spine 1 Poison 1 Suicide by Poison 1 „ „ Wounds 1 Haemoptysis I Meningitis 1 Apoplexy 1 Scalds 1 Burns 1 Convulsions 1 Pneumonia 1 The sanitary work executed during the year will be shown in the subjoined list.

Gentlemen, During the year ending Midsummer last, I have received from your Inspectors and analysed 86 samples of food and drink. This small number is due to the fact that during the December quarter no samples were taken—owing no doubt to the resignation of one of the Inspectors. These consisted of:— Brandy 4 samples. Butter 1 „ Coffee 12 „ Cocoa 2 „ Coffee and Chicory 1 „ Gin 7 „ Milk 4 „ Rum 1 „ Soda Water 1 „ Whiskey 16 „ 86 Brandy.—All four samples were genuine and of the strength 24°, 24°, 15° and 14° u.p. Butter. — The only sample received was genuine. Coffee.—Ten samples were genuine. One contained GO per cent. of chicory and one a trace only of chicory—no doubt an accidental admixture in grinding the beans. 55 Cocoa.— Two samples were received and both were genuine and of good quality. Coffee and Chicory.— One sample was received. It consisted of equal parts of the two ingredients and therefore was correctly described. Gin.—Seven samples were received. Two were genuine and above the legal limit, being 30f° and 34£° u.p. respectively. Five samples were more or less watered, being 41°, 40°, 38°, 36½° and 35½° u.p. The last two were so triflingly below the the limit that they could hardly be considered to be wilfully adulterated. It has become a common practice by publicans to exhibit a notice in the bar to the effect that "all spirits sold here are diluted." Many of the Metropolitan Magistrates hold that the exhibition of this notice protects the publican, and therefore several prosecutions have failed, On this account, I understand hat no proceedings are now taken by your inspectors where such a notice is exhibited in the bar of the public house at which ???diluted spirits are sold. Milk.—Forty-one samples in all were analysed. Of these, thirty-two were genuine—some being of excellent quality and only seven of poor quality. The following Milks were more or less adulterated:— Containing added water— 1 sample 18 percent. 1 „ 10 „ 1 „ 8 „ 1 „ 6 „ 1 „ 5 „ 1 „ 4 „ One sample was watered to the extent of 5 per cent. and leficient in fat, 40 per cent. One sample was sold as separated milk, and was found to be what it was described. 56 One sample was sold as part skimmed milk and contained just half the usual proportion of cream—hence it was correctly described. Thus out of 41 samples, 6 only were actually adulterated (the one containing 4 per cent. being possibly genuine though very poor milk). Rum.—One sample only was analysed, it was genuine and of strength 24° u.p. Soda Water.—One sample was received. It proved to be ordinary spring water aerated, and contained no bicarbonate of Soda at all. Such aerated water should not be sold as "Soda Water," as when the latter article is asked for the Soda Water of the Pharmacopoeia is meant, containing a definite proportion of bicarbonate of soda and of the nature of a medicinal preparation. As an ordinary non-medicinal beverage the simple aerated water is often to be preferred, but it should be sold as such. Whiskey.— Thirteen samples out of 16 were above the legal strength:— 3 samples 16° under proof 1 „ 17° „ 1 „ 20¾° „ 1 „ 22° „ 1 „ 22¾° „ 1 „ 23° „ 1 23¼° „ 2 „ 23½° 1 „ 24° 1 „ 25° Three samples were below the legal limit, being 25½°, 27½° and 33½° under proof. Of these the first was so triflingly watered that it could scarcely be considered as wilfully adulterated. The adulterated samples were therefore— 1 Coffee 3 Gins (omitting the two slightly-watered given) 6 Milks 1 Soda Water 2 Whiskies 13 57 This, on a total of 86, equals 15.1 per cent. of adulterated samples. Of the Milks, 6 out of 41 were decidedly adulterated, giving a percentage of 14.6. I am, gentlemen, Faithfully yours, R. BODMER, F.I.C. Analytical Laboratory, 16, Southwark Street.
