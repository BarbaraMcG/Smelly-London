Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1953. This is my first report to you, as I took over my duties on the 1st January, 1953 from Dr. Stewart on his promotion to the appointment of Deputy County Medical Officer of Health, after his six years' meritorious service with this large and important Metropolitan Borough. The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough has again been low, with the exception of the outbreak of measles (858 notified cases) which nevertheless did not reach the proportions of the previous two years either in extent or severity. Unhappily there was a slight increase in the death rate over the preceding year (12.63 of. 11.62). This was in large measure due to the disastrous fog which enveloped the whole Metropolis in mid-December, 1952, with resulting increase in deaths from bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in the aged population, during the months of January and February. In this connection it should be noted that the Public Health Committee installed in the Borough in June, 1953 a recording apparatus for measuring the content of the atmospheric pollution, and to which detailed reference is made in the body of this report. It is pleasing to report that the death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis fell to an all time record of 0.19 (of. 0.83 of 10 years ago). There is, however, little change in the number of notified cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, which fact is probably explained by the increased vigilance and acumen of the Chest Consultants whereby pulmonary cases are now diagnosed which previously might have been missed. My predecessor has pointed out the difficulty experienced in obtaining "adequate repairs to a certain class of property." In appropriate cases the Council continues to do the work in default, in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Housing Act. Unfortunately experience would indicate that the number of properties which can be dealt with in this manner is limited owing to the cost of repairs as compared with computed valuation of the property concerned. Indeed certain of the Underground Rooms which have been closed might well have been made available for the badly needed housing accommodation in the Borough, except for the fact that it was not an economic proposition for the owners to undertake the somewhat extensive works necessary. Particular reference must be made to the ever increasing time of your officers which is being given to the care and attention of the old people in the Borough. The importance of this work cannot, in my opinion, be overestimated. Plans for its extension were made during the year, and it is confidently anticipated that they will be put into operation during 1954. I have included in this report an extract from a report by the organiser to the Old People's Welfare Committee, which works in close co-operation with your Public Health Department, and indicates the success of the manifold activities of that body. In conclusion may I express my gratitude for the help and co-operation I have received from the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. 4 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (at 31st December, 1953).— Mr. F. H. Barrett Mrs. I. L.

Bacteriological examinations.—The number of examinations made in connection with infectious disease was 234 (333) including 18 (15) examinations of sputum for tuberculosis. Routine examinations were also made of the water from the Council's swimming baths. Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1953.—These regulations, which supersede the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1927 and the Infectious Diseases (London) Regulations, 1927, came into operation on 1st April, 1953. In their general substance the new regulations are similar to the old but have been framed to accord with the present shape and working of the health services, especially concerning the prevention of food poisoning. Under the old regulations, the provisions concerning action to be taken by local authorities and medical officers of health against the risk of food poisoning applied to "enteric fever and dysentery." They now apply to "typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever or other salmonella infections, dysentery, and staphylococcal infection likely to cause food poisoning." Under the new regulations action can be taken, not only as regards a person suffering from the disease, but also a person shown to be a carrier of the disease. A person in either class may now be prohibited not only from continuing to work in an occupation connected with food or drink, but also from entering such an occupation. Further, a medical officer of health duly authorised by his authority, is permitted to take the prescribed action in a particular case without, as was hitherto required, previously reporting it to his authority—if in his judgment such action is called for as a matter of immediate urgency to prevent the spread of infection. In such cases a full report is required to be made at the earliest opportunity. The necessary authorisation to enable me to issue any notices on behalf of the Council under Parts II and III of the Fourth Schedule to the new regulations was contained in the Resolution of the Council of the 30th April, 1953. Visiting.—Puerperal pyrexia, ophthalmia neonatorum and infective enteritis cases are visited by the London County Council's Health Visitors and tuberculosis by the Nurses at the Chest Clinic. Cases of other infectious diseases and associated enquiries are made by the Council's Visitors except smallpox case enquiries which are made by the male Sanitary Inspectors. The following table gives details of the visits made by the Council's officers.

MORTUARY.—The number of bodies received at the mortuary was 395 (398) and 339 (326) post mortem examinations were made there. The improvements to the reception and viewing facilities were completed in June at a cost of £820. The erection of a small waiting room remote from the viewing and post mortem rooms has provided increased comfort to members of the public who have to visit the mortuary; and the curtaining off of a space for viewing purposes has ensured relatives of the privacy so necessary at those times. These improvements have made it possible for the officers concerned to carry out this service with the minimum of distress to the visiting public and I am pleased to be able to report that the new arrangements have proved eminently satisfactory.

FUMIGATION SERVICE and MEDICINAL BATHS.—The decline in the number of bed bug infestations has continued probably due in part to the greater efficacy of modern methods of control. While the number of cockroach infestations remains high, the increase has been arrested, and favourable results are being obtained from new methods and materials. Only one (1) notice was served under section 123 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. DisinJestation:— Rooms treated for vermin 1,428 (1,538) Articles disinfested 3,089 (2,200) Disinfection:— Rooms disinfected after infectious disease 317 (226) library books disinfected 422 (605) Articles of clothing, etc., disinfected 4,714 (1,100) Scabies:— Number of adults treated 121 (105) Number of children treated 24 (8) Number of treatments given 227 (185) Vermin:— Heads Bodies Number of adults treated 71 (92) 95 (138) Number of children treated 28 (51) 1 (12) ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION.—Reference was made by Dr. Stewart in his introductory letter to his Annual Report for 1952 to "one of the worst fogs on record" which occurred in the last month of that year. Subsequently the Public Health Committee obtained the approval of the Council for the installation in the borough of a recording apparatus for measuring the rainfall, insoluble and soluble deposits and the sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere which, with the consent of the London County Council, has been installed on the roof of the Welfare Centre, 283a, Harrow Road. Observations commenced on 1st June, 1953 and the following results have been recorded:— June July August September October November December Rainfall in mms 52 97 47 38 65 34 15 Insoluble deposits in tons per square mile 7.88 8.66 6.28 8.38 9.43 9.75 10.17 Soluble deposits in tons per square mile 6.61 4.97 3.79 6.24 10.71 9.53 8.79 SO3 in mgs. per day per 100 square cms 0.88 0.70 1.05 0.76 2 75 3.66 4.47 10 The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research—Fuel Research, by means of the data thus available obtains added knowledge of the nature and amount of atmospheric pollution which, it is hoped, will eventually lead to effective action to reduce pollution of the atmosphere. This can only be achieved by continuous measurement by scientific standardised methods, and this Council, in concert with other Metropolitan Borough Councils, by the installation of standardised deposit gauges in their areas are making a valuable contribution to these investigations.

SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS ACTS.—No licences to act as slaughtermen were applied for. One licence, granted in 1951, is still in force. RAG FLOCK ACT.—Five (5) premises where filling material was being used were on the register at the end of the year. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock is manufactured or stored. Eleven (12) samples were taken. All were satisfactory except one of cotton felt where the trash content was 10.4% against the statutory limitation of 7.5%. The matter was taken up with the suppliers and after consulting the Public Health Committee the firm concerned were warned but no further action was considered necessary. CANAL BOATS.—During 1953 Paddington Basin was visited on 38 (40) occasions and 22 (26) inspections of canal boats were made. It was not found necessary to serve any notices. One (1) child of school age was found to be living aboard the boats inspected. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACTS.—At the end of the year the Register contained the names of 113 (115) persons entitled to sell the poisons scheduled in Part II of the Poisons List. SMOKE NUISANCE.—Two (6) complaints regarding smoke nuisance were received during the year. Both complaints were remedied by the firms concerned without statutory action by the Department. RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST (RESTRICTIONS) ACTS.—One (12) certificates of disrepair was applied for. This was granted. No (1) clearance certificates were applied for. 13 DRAINAGE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.—During the year 260 (274) plans were submitted for drainage work in existing buildings. Legal proceedings are reported under the appropriate section. COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—There is only one common lodging house in the Borough—a Cecil House—which provides sixty-six beds for women. BAKEHOUSES.—There are now 5 (8) "underground" and 18 (18) "level" bakehouses in the Borough. During the year 147 (195) inspections were made. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and has been satisfactory. One (1) water supply certificate was issued under Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. PET ANIMALS ACT.—Seven (7) licences were applied for and granted during the year. Routine inspections were made in order to ensure that the conditions attaching to the licences were being maintained. RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. The figures relate to the fifteen months ended 31st March, 1954, at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries as it is proposed that the statistical year should in future coincide with the financial year. Dwelling Houses All other Property Total Total number of properties in district 23,581 4,683 28,264 Number of properties inspected as a result of— (a) Notifications 817 228 1,045 (b) Otherwise 87 30 117 Number of properties found to be infested by rats— (a) Major infestation — 2 2 (b) Minor infestation 240 92 332 Number of properties found to be seriously infested by mice 218 62 280 Number of infested properties treated by rodent operatives 458 156 614 It was not found necessary to serve any notices. Eight "block control" schemes were carried out. The sewers in the Borough received two treatments, in January and June. A further 100 trays were fixed in the sewers to facilitate baiting, leaving 50 trays still to be fixed to complete this work. SHOPS ACTS.—The Shops Acts Inspectors made 1,477 (1,351) visits. No statutory action was necessary, all contraventions found being dealt with informally. FOOD SUPERVISION.— Unsound food.—Approximately 11¾ (11) tons of diseased or unsound food were surrendered for destruction. Diseased meat is incinerated, meat and other food fit for animal consumption is added to the pig swill collected, while other condemned food is disposed of with household refuse. The Public Health Committee were consulted regarding the case of a nail found in a biscuit. A report was obtained on the factory where the biscuits were manufactured from the local authority. No action was considered necessary except to warn the firm concerned. Bacteriological examinations.—The number of samples of milk submitted to see if they complied with the tests prescribed by the Milk Regulations was 120 (133) ; all of which were found to be satisfactory. Samples of ice cream examined for bacterial content as prescribed in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations gave the following results: Grade 1 5 (9) Grade 3 4 (7) Grade 2 4 (20) Grade 4 7 (3) Food Poisoning.—During July an outbreak of food poisoning occurred in two schools in the Borough, and 97 cases were reported. The agent causing the outbreak, staphylococcus aureus, was isolated from a sample of dried milk used in the making of cream for the school dinners. Following enquiries made during this outbreak a further consignment of ten barrels of dried milk sent to manufacturers in the Borough in August was sampled. Some of these samples were found to be infected with staphylococcus aureus coagulose positive. One unopened barrel was returned 14 to the wholesalers under Ministry of Food supervision and 827 lbs. of chocolate couverture made from the infected milk was held to be unfit for human consumption and destroyed. The other five barrels had been used to make ice cream. A sample of this ice cream was negative, due to the heat treatment of the mix during the process of manufacture. Also during July an outbreak of food poisoning occurred in a hospital in the Borough involving 25 cases. The agent was salmonella typhimurium, but it was not possible to establish the source of the infection. The following table gives a summary of the corrected cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning notified during the year:— Number of corrected cases 107 (38) Outbreaks due to identified agents.— Total outbreaks 3 (—) Total cases 31 (—) Outbreaks due to— Chemical poisons — (—) Salmonella organisms 1 (—) Staphylococci 2 (—) Cl. botulinum — (—) Other bacteria — (—) Outbreaks of undiscovered cause— Total outbreaks — (1) Total cases —(4) Single cases— Agents identified 6 (3) Unknown cause 70 (31) Sampling.—The following table gives details of the 600 (551) samples submitted to the Public Analyst during the year:— Number Examined Number Adulterated Number Examined Number Adulterated Formal Informal Fo¬r mal Informal Formal Informal Formal Informal Ale 3 Evaporated milk — 4 — — Almond paste — 1 — — Faggots — — 1 — — Almonds, ground — 3 — — Fishcakes — 1 — — Almonds, salted — 1 — — Fish, canned — 3 — — Aspirin tablets — 3 — — Fish paste — 8 — — Bacon — 2 — — Fish, potted — 1 — — Beef extract — 2 — — Fish sauce — 1 — — Bicarbonate of soda — 2 — — Flavouring essence — 4 — — Blancmange powder — 1 — — Flour — 3 — — Boracic acid — 2 — — Foam crystals — 1 — — Bouillon — 1 — French dressing — 1 — — Brawn — 1 — — Fruit, bottled — 4 — — Bread — 16 — — Fruit, canned — 11 — — Butter — 2 — — Fruit, dried — 9 — — Cakes — 1 — — Fruit, glace — 2 — — Calomine lotion — 2 — — Fruit juice — 1 — — Camphorated oil — 1 — — Fruit pie — 1 — — Cheese — 8 — — Gelatine — 1 — — Cinnamon essence — 1 — — Glucose — 1 — — Cockles, bottled — 1 — — Guava curd — 1 — — Coconut, dessicated — 2 — — Halibut liver oil — 1 — — Codeine tablets — 1 — — Halva — 1 — — Coffee — 1 — — Ham — 3 — — Coffee essence — 3 — — Ham, canned — 1 — — Colouring — 1 — — Ham, potted — 1 — — Cooking fat — 2 — — Haslet — 1 — — Cordial — 5 — — Herrings in aspic — 1 — — Cough mixture — 13 — — Honey — i — — Cottage pie, canned — 1 — — Hydrogen peroxide — 2 — — Cream, bottled — 1 — — Ice-cream — 19 — — Cream, canned — 6 — — Ice lollies — 8 — — Cream of tartar — 1 — — Indigestion mixture — 1 — — Cucumber, bottled — 1 — — Iodine — 5 — — Curry powder — 1 — — Jam — 9 — — Dessert powder — 1 — — Jellied veal — 2 — — Dripping — 2 — — Jelly — 1 — — 15 Number Examined Number Adulterated Number Examined Number Adulterated Formal Informal Formal Informal Formal Informal Formal Informal Kidneys, canned — 1 — — Saccharine tablets 1 — — Laxative — 4 — — Sago — 1 — — Lemon curd — 1 — — Sal volatile — 1 — — Lemonade crystals — 1 — — Salt, garlic — 1 — — Liniment — 2 — — Sauce — 1 — — Liquid paraffin — 2 — — Sausage rolls — 1 — — Lotion — 1 — — Sausages — 17 — — Luncheon meat, canned — 2 — — Seasoning — 1 — — Lysol — 1 — — Sedative — 1 — — Macaroni — 1 — — Semolina — 1 — — Margarine — 2 — — Soup,canned — 4 — — Marmalade — 4 — — Soup, powder — 1 — — Marrons glace — 1 — — Spaghetti, canned — 1 — — Marzipan — 1 — — Spice — 4 — — Mayonnaise — 1 — — Stedman's powder — 1 — — Meat paste — 3 — — Stewed beef, canned — 2 — — Meat pudding, canned — 2 — — Stout — 7 — — Milk 45 171 — 1 Suet — 5 — — Mincemeat — 5 — — Sugar — 4 — — Mineral waters — 7 — — Sulphur ointment — 1 — — Mint sauce — 3 — — Sulphur tablets — 2 — 1 Mushrooms, pickled — 1 — — Sunny spread — 1 — — Mustard, prepared — 1 — — Sweets — 3 — — Nutmeg, ground — 1 — — Tapioca — 1 — — Olive oil — 1 — — Tea — 4 — — Peanut butter — 3 — — Throat tablets — 2 — — Peanuts, salted — 1 — — Tomato juice — 4 — — Pectin — 1 — — Tomato paste — 1 — — Peel — 2 — — Tonic — 1 — — Pepper — 3 — — Travel tablets — 1 — — Peppermints — 1 — — Vegetables, canned — 6 — — Phospherine — 1 — — Vitacream — 1 — — Pickles — 1 — — Vinegar — 4 — — Potatoes, canned — 2 — — Walnuts, pickled — 1 — — Pressed beef — 1 — — Welsh rarebit 2 — — Pudding, canned — 2 — — White precipitate ointment — 2 — — Quinine 1 6 1 1 Yeast — 1 — — Ravioli, canned — 1 — — Youghourt — 1 — — Rice — 2 — — Zinc ointment — 1 — — The sulphur tablets were slightly deficient in flowers of sulphur which in the Analyst's opinion might have been caused by insufficient mixing during manufacture. The adulterated informal milk sample had approximately 10 per cent. f added water. A formal sample taken subsequently was however genuine. Samples are being taken regularly to ensure that the milk from this farm is consistently genuine. The ammoniated quinine samples were deficient in ammonia. This was found to be due to insufficient corking. The batch of bottles concerned were withdrawn by the manufacturers. Licences.—Licences to sell designated milk in force at the end of the year are given below:— nation Dealers' Principal Licences Dealers' Supplementary Licences "Pasteurised" 78 (77) 20 (19) " Sterilised " 117 (113) 22 (22) " Tuberculin tested " 60 (58) 20 (19) Registrtions.—The following registrations were in force at the end of the year under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, or Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Distributors of milk 118 (117) Dairies — (—) Ice cream premises 195 (193) Food premises (sausages etc.) 75 (75) 16 Inspections.—During the year the two Food Inspectors paid 636 (652) visits to restaurants and cafes, and 5,312 (5,209) visits to other " food " premises. Food premises.—Following are details of the food premises in the Borough at the end of the year:— Food Shops Bakers 25 (27) Provision stores 22 (127) Cake shops 20 (16) Horsemeat shops Butchers 60 (59) (human consumption) 2 (2) Confectioners 107 (107) Domestic stores 17 (14) Chemists 51 (51) Corn chandlers 2 (2) Fishmongers 24 (24) Greengrocers 93 (91) Fried fish shops 12 (19) Public Houses 105 (105) Grocers 41 (36) Cider Houses 2 (2) General shops 43 (44) Off Licences 57 (57) Cafes, restaurants, etc. 143 (143) Food Factories:— There are 10 (11) food factories in the Borough including 2 (3) ice-cream factories.

General.—There are 134 current cases on the records of the Department, of which 63 were brought to our notice in 1953. No action was necessary in 29 of these new cases. The Council's Visitors made 555 calls to investigate new cases and to keep in touch with old ones. In connection with the new cases, the following services were, or had already been, obtained:— Home Help Service 12 District Nursing Service 1 W.V.S. Meals Service 2 Cases were also referred to the Bodies mentioned below:— National Assistance Board 2 Hospital Bed Service 6 L.C.C. Blind Welfare Dept. 1 L.C.C. Institutions 8 Where necessary bedding was disinfected, and disrepair referred to the Sanitary Inspector. Relatives were informed where it was thought that they could help. National Assistance Acts.—It was not found necessary to apply to the Courts for a compulsory removal order in any case referred to the Department. Holiday Home.—During the year 632 (583) guests were accommodated. It is worthy of note that the Council have come to an arrangement with the Bexhill authorities whereby the latter will carry out minor repairs by direct labour up to a cost not exceeding £10 and will also inspect any work done by a contractor. This arrangement will not only save the time and expense of officers of this authority travelling to and from Bexhill but will ensure prompter action and closer supervision. The charge for the work by direct labour has been agreed on the basis of actual cost plus 20 per cent., and, for the supervision of contractor's work, 5 per cent. on the cost of work executed. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE.—The following extract from a report by the Organiser to the Committee shows the scope and extent of the help given. The Committee is now firmly established and its services are increasingly sought by statutory bodies, doctors and the general public. A register of old people is being maintained and to date has 1,500 names. Visiting.—The value of friendly visiting cannot be too strongly stressed, and eighteen ladies have volunteered for this service and each has adopted one old person to visit. The visiting of friendless patients in the Chronic Ward 17 of Paddington Hospital continues and is greatly appreciated both by the patients and the staff. The general public too are becoming more "old people conscious" and practical gifts such as mattresses, clothing, wheelchairs, commodes, books, etc., have arrived at the office. These are all most acceptable and are put to immediate use. Coronation.—During this Coronation Year many functions were arranged for old folk. The Coronation route tour, organised by the Committee, was a great success—four coaches being filled. The two Coronation seats allocated to the Committee were won by two old ladies who witnessed the procession with great delight. Alexandra Rose Day.—A depot was organised and as a result the sum of £25 has been received from the Alexandra Rose Day funds. Harvest Gift Celebrations.—The Head Mistress of Droop Street Infant School asked us to help with the distribution of her pupils' gifts to the old people. Forty-five old folk were invited to attend and each received a parcel of groceries and fruit. In addition, sixty parcels were delivered to the bedridden and patients in the Chronic Ward in Paddington Hospital. Homes.—Thirty old people have been helped to enter private or the London County Council Homes. Christmas Period.—Two parties were taken to pantomimes on ice and one to the circus. The Rotary Club again gave a most successful party at the Porchester Theatre for 250 old folk. Thanks to the wheelchairs and a car service provided by the Rotarians many crippled folk were able to attend the party. Food Parcels.—Shortly before Christmas His Worship the Mayor asked the Committee to distribute 1,000 food parcels he had received from America. Seven hundred old people were invited to attend at the Town Hall on December 22nd. A further one hundred parcels were delivered to the housebound and the balance was distributed on January 5th. Frozen Christmas Dinners.—Through the generosity of His Worship the Mayor, the Rotary Club and two anonymous donors it was again possible for the Committee to deliver fifty frozen dinners on Christmas Eve. Chiropody.—This service is a real blessing to old folk, and there is an ever increasing demand for appointments. In December the service was increased to two sessions a week, and in addition the Chiropodist now devotes one session a month to visiting patients in their homes. Holidays.—During the year thirty-five old people were sent for recuperative and private holidays at various seaside resorts. Mention should be made of the invaluable help given by the National Assistance Board and particularly the Salvation Army. One of the difficulties with Old People's Welfare is that the giving of advice is not always the end of the story. Any sort of work may have to be done for them as they are often incapable of doing it themselves and the need is usually immediate. HEALTH EDUCATION. The CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN in the Borough has continued to be based on the personal approach to those concerned, and very good results have been obtained by the co-operation of the food handlers. This personal approach is of course not possible with the food consumers who have to be contacted through the medium of posters and pamphlets. Details of the food premises in the Borough and the inspections made will be found under the " Food" section. Voluntary SMALLPOX VACCINATION and DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION has been maintained by the personal approach to the mothers by the London County Council's Health Visitors. The Borough Council co-operate in the display of posters. Particulars of the MASS X-RAY UNIT's services were circulated to local medical practitioners, and the bigger firms in the Borough are encouraged by an appointments system to arrange for their staffs to be examined. Posters and pamphlets are used to tell the public of the Unit's visits. VENEREAL DISEASE notices showing the facilities for treatment are exhibited in the public lavatories, and are also available in leaflet form from the Public Health Department. Special posters are exhibited when requested by the London County Council. The CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR HEALTH EDUCATION provide excellent pamphlets on many diseases at practically cost price for issue to the public. A typical example is the pamphlet on poliomyelitis. This is a particularly valuable one, because it puts in simple language the precautions which the public should take if there is an epidemic in the district. 18 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. This Act came into operation on the 23rd March, 1953 and regulations made thereunder came into operation on the 1st October, 1953. Briefly the regulations require fireguards to be fitted to gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters which are so designed that they are suitable for use in residential premises and are of such a type that, without a guard, there is a likelihood of injury by burning. The standards of construction and fitting for guards and the tests to be employed in ascertaining whether guards comply with those standards are set out in the schedule to the regulations. Heating appliances, other than imported appliances, manufactured before the date of the coming into operation of the regulations and not fitted with the requisite guard, may be sold or let until the end of September, 1954. Appliances for sale for scrap are also exempted. The necessary resolution authorising the Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspectors to inspect and test appliances was passed by the Council on the 25th June, 1953. HOUSING. Houses unfit for human habitation. No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 233 (216) No. of upper parts of premises dealt with by closing orders 2 (2) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted 2 (4) Nineteen (46) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations, eighteen (16) being rehoused by the Paddington Borough Council, and one (3) secured accommodation privately. Closing orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on twenty-one (6) basements and the upper parts of two (2) mews premises. Twenty-two (8) other basements were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. Legal proceedings were taken against an owner for permitting the use for human habitation of basement rooms in contravention of the terms of the closing orders in force. The magistrate imposed a fine of £5 in respect of each room and ordered the owner to pay two guineas costs. Compulsory Repairs. Seven (22) notices under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936 were served during the year. In no case was the notice complied with, although work was in progress at five (14) of the premises. In addition, work was being carried out in default at one premises and at the other nothing had been done. Of the seventeen (32) notices served prior to 1953 which remained outstanding twelve (30) were complied with by the owners, default action was taken by the Council in three (2) other cases, and two notices are still outstanding. At one other premises the owner executed the required works without formal action being taken. Entries in Rent Books. Section 4 of the Housing Act, 1936 requires that the rent books in houses occupied, or of a type suitable for occupation, by persons of the working classes shall contain:— (1) the name and address of the medical officer of health for the district, and (2) the name and address of the landlord or other person who is directly responsible for keeping the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. Two reports were received as to rent books not containing the required particulars. Cautionary letters were sent to the owners. Housing Act, 1936—Overcrowding. (a) (1) No. of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 327 (395) (2) No. of families dwelling therein 338(411) (3) No. of persons dwelling therein 1,369 (units) (1,600) (b) No. of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 87 (63) (1) No. of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 155 (216) (2) No. of persons concerned in such cases 611 (units) (722½) The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1953 (327) shows a decrease of 68 on the figure for 1952 (395). Some 82 of these were basement dwellings. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 11 (29) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 39 (52) were rehoused by the London County Council, 1 was rehoused by the Weiwyn and Hatfield Development Corporation, 70 (108) secured accommodation privately, and 34 (27) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. 19 The practice of sending warning letters to owners and landlords against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding of premises has been abated. Rehousing Enquiries. Some 900 communications were received during the year from the Borough Director of Housing, the County Divisional Medical Officer, the County Director of Housing and Valuer, and from other authorities, requesting information on the housing conditions of persons applying for rehousing on grounds of overcrowding, insanitary conditions, and ill-health. Such information enables the enquirer to assess the degree of priority to be given to the applicants concerned. In each case a visit was made by the Sanitary Inspector and a report furnished. Housing Accommodation: Preferential Treatment.— Six (12) families recommended for preferential consideration in the allocation of accommodation on medical grounds were rehoused by the Borough Council and six (17) by the London County Council. This is the first complete year in which arrangements whereby certificates of medical practitioners submitted in support of housing applications have been passed to me for the purpose of awarding "points" in accordance with the medical reports submitted. During the year 521 cases have been dealt with. This arrangement has also been instrumental in bringing to my notice sanitary defects which might otherwise have escaped detection and in respect of which no complaint had been received. Necessary action has been taken in such cases. New Accommodation. During the year 146 flats at Hallfield, 12 at Leamington House, 40 at Gilbert Sheldon House, and 10 at Philip Court were completed, and selected applicants rehoused therein. The following is a list of Council owned new accommodation:— Pre-War No. of flats.
