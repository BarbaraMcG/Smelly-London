HY. EMBLEM, B. DUCKHAM, GEO. WEDLAKE, J. MILLER, JAMES J. MUSTO, Auditors. VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Cown, SURVEYOR'S DEPARTMENT. REPORT & ACCOUNTS OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25 th MARCH, 1881, REPORT. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in again submitting to you a statement of the works carried out in my department. It has been necessary to replace the portion of the paving on the north side of Commercial Road, between a point short of the "George Public House" and the western boundary, part of the road repaired by the Yestry. The New Road has, by the ordinary wear, required repaving. The portion of the Commercial Road above referred to was paved by the Tramway Company and represented the compensation to the St. George's Yestry, which they were entitled to under the Tramway Act, and which this Vestry had the benefit of when they arranged to keep this part of the road in repair for the St. George's Vestry they, taking in exchange, an equal area at the western end of the road. This paving, which was 4-in. by 7-in. Rowley rag stone, was laid in 187 . The New Road was laid in 1852. The work has been carried out under contract by Mr. Rutty in a satisfactory manner. The old stone arising from these works has been laid in Steel's Lane, Cadiz Street, Friendly Place, now Ely Terrace, and the crossings of the streets lying between the New Road and Philpot Street, Lady Lakes Grove and Assembly Passage. The quantities laid were as follows:— Yards super. New 4-in. by 7-in. Kincardineshire pitching 3328 Old pitching redressed and relaid 3998 The cost of these works was £2,749 16s. 0d. CARRIAGEWAY PAVING. 6o The paving laid by the Vestry in the Mile End and Commercial Roads has not yet required any repairs, except where openings have been made. These works, executed in the year 1873, will therefore pay a good interest upon the outlay as compared with the cost of macadamising them. A contract is now in course of execution for paving the roadway of Stepney Iligh Street and the footway of Stepney Green and Commercial Road. I would strongly advise that a certain portion of the footways of the main thoroughfares should be replaced with new stone every year. By this means large outlays in one year will become unnecessary, and the present ratepayers will be bearing their proper proportion of the maintenance of the roads of the Hamlet. It must be remembered that money cannot be readily obtained for paving roads which are already paved, or for which money has once been borrowed. Unless a proper proportion of the footways are repaved every year it must necessarily follow that occasionally large sums have to be expended for paving works; the money raised by loan, the largest portion of the interest of which has to be paid by the ratepayers who live in the Hamlet at that time. The necessity of paving some of the most important streets in the Hamlet has been recently under your consideration, and I cannot too strongly urge upon you the advisability of paving Stepney Green and Devonshire Street at the earliest opportunity you think financial arrangements will permit. In the present days when steam rolling has become quite a necessity in any civilized district, the advisability of paving the channels is a question of great importance, and this matter has been very fully considered by your Highway Committee, who have arranged the various streets into three classes, preference being given to those of the largest traffic. The material laid in the channels of Bancroft Road a year ago does not show the slightest sign of wear—indeed there is practically no wear in a channel—and it is the cheapest and most regularly formed material for the purpose with which 1 am acquainted. It is the annealed slag from the iron furnaces in the Cleveland districts, and is a hard silicate of lime. A few hundred pounds per annum spent in paving channels would soon repay the outlay, and would improve the appearance and sanitary condition of the roads. 61 ASPHALTE. The footways laid with this material have been kept in repair by the Val de Travers and Societie Francjais des Asphalte Companies under their contract. The last length which gave way in the Mile End Road was replaced with York paving. SCAVENGING ROADS. It will be seen from the following tabular statement that a considerale saving has been effected in the drivers and fillers for slop carts. This is owing to the more favourable winter season of the present year. This has also led to a saving in the cost of horses for this purpose. The Vestry now having the full number of horses for which their premises are constructed, the cost per day per horse is therefore reduced to 6s. 6d. as compared with 6s. n£d. for the year ending March, 1880. The Vestry's horses worked 8756 days for one-horse and cost ^*2853 16s. 3d.—of this sum ^*433 4s. od. represented depreciation and interest on capital, and £2420 12s. 3d. keep of horses and establishment charges. THE REMOVAL OF DUST. The cost of removing dust from the Hamlet has increased nearly ^160 upon the cost of last year. This is caused by the increase in the quantity of dust to be collected and the small amount received for sale of dust as compared with last year, and I anticipate that the current year will shew a still greater difference. This is owing to the variation in the market price of dust and ashes. DISPOSAL OF STREET REFUSE. The Vestry having been deprived of their shoot at Wick Lane which last year contributed so materially to reduce this item of expenditure, they, however, entered into an arrangement with the Great Eastern Railway Company, which has been very beneficial, and it will be seen that the cost during the past year does not amount to as much as it did in 1879, when the Vestry had to pay a large sum for the use of a shoot.

MUSTO, j 1 Hamlet of Mile End Town, ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1880-81, by MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. london: PENNY & HULL, Steam Printers, 53, Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1881. 1 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, fOR THE YEAR 1880-81. Gentlemen, I beg to present the Twenty-fifth Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of the Hamlet, for the year ending March, 1881. BIRTHS. The births registered during the 52 weeks were 4117, compared with 4298 and 4242 in the two previous years. They were most numerous during the fourth, and least during the first quarter of the year. The natural increase of population or excess of births over deaths was 1841, showing a birth-rate of 37.42; the rate for the whole metropolis being somewhat lower, viz.: 36.2. The relative number of males and females born and the births during each quarter are shown in Table I. DEATHS. The total deaths, 2276, show a decrease of 250, compared with those registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality per xooo population living in the Hamlet was 20.69, compared with 22.96 for the previous year, and 22.2 for the whole metropolis. 4 Of the 2276 deaths, 387 occurred in the north, 567 in the east, 293 in the west, 528 in the centre, and 251 in the south wards; the remaining 250 occurred in the Workhouse. (See Table V.) Of the 4117 children born in the Hamlet, 649 died during the first year of life, being 15.58 percent. of the registered births, and nearly 29 percent. of the total deaths. The number of deaths of children under 5 years of age was 1089; this represents about 47 percent. of the entire mortality. The deaths were registered of 280 persons over 70 years of age; the greatest age attained being 97. Reference to Table IV will show the mortality at other ages. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. From the eight principal zymotic diseases, 368 deaths occurred, compared with 413 for the previous year; the death-rate being 3.34 as is shown in Table III. Whilst the above figures represent all the deaths which actually occurrcd in the Hamlet from these diseases, they do not include the deaths from small-pox and fever which occurred to patients who had been removed to the various hospitals from this Hamlet—of these deaths I have no record. Reference to the Sanitary Inspector's Report will give some idea of the measures taken to prevent the spread of this class of diseases. Thus the number of houses disinfected was 136 and the number of articles of bedding and clothing disinfected was 720. SMALL POX. The deaths from small-pox in London for the last four years have been as follow:— 1877 2544 deaths. 1878 1416,, 1879 458 „ 1880 475 ,, During the first three months of the year 1880, the number of cases of small-pox was inconsiderable, but steadily increased during the months of April, May, June and July. During the next three months the disease rapidly declined until, in October, the number of cases only slightly exceeded those during the first three months of the year. In November, the disease again increased and quickly spreading, had, by the end of the year, assumed the proportions of an epidemic ; which, at the time I write, is still raging, not only in Mile End but the whole metropolis. I have caused every means at my disposal to be used to limit the epidemic in this Hamlet; every case was enquired into by competent persons ; the occupiers of the infected houses provided with printed instructions as to isolation and other sanitary precautions; all cases of non-vaccinated children coming to my knowledge were at 5 once reported to Mr. Matthews, the Vaccination Officer; the adults in infected houses urged, in a great many instances successfully, to avail themselves of the protection afforded by re-vaccination ; and the Board and other school officials informed of those houses in which infectious disease existed in the vicinity of the several schools. From the result of the enquiries I found that a very large proportion of the cases in the early stages of this epidemic originated in houses occupied by customhouse officials, dock labourers, and persons engaged in cleansing and making up imported articles, such as feathers, etc. It would appear from this that the epidemic may have been sustained or even originated through these channels. This is a subject which merits further consideration and investigation, although it would of course be attended by great difficulties. Until January, 1881, the cases were for the most part sent to hospital at the expense of the Vestry, but latterly the Guardians have undertaken the removal of all patients who are unable to pay the fees for the private hospital. In March, 1881, all the small-pox hospitals were full, and much difficulty was experienced in getting the patients removed. Sometimes a case had to be kept at home in a house occupied by several families for many days until a vacancy occurred in one of the hospitals. In many instances where this was the case, the disease spread not only to other occupants of the infected house but to several houses in the same streets. This should surely teach us the value of small-pox hospitals. When a case is treated at home the house becomes a centre of infection, for it is impossible to efficiently isolate patients in small crowded houses ; and when we consider that washing, mangling, tailoring and many similar businesses are frequently carried on in the same house, sometimes even in the same room which a small-pox patient is occupying, perhaps for several days before the case is reported to the Medical Officer, it becomes apparent how very serious the danger of extension must be. It may be urged that a small-pox hospital is also a centre of infection ; that it is so to a certain extent may be correct—that it ought not to be I assert without hesitation; and should these hospitals ever be closed the consequences must be most serious, unless, indeed, the public could be taught to understand that, rigid sanitation, aided by efficient vaccination and re-vaccination, are an absolute protection from, and prevention against, the disease; and even then the un-vaccinated population (viz.: newly-born infants), must always be very considerable. In March, the Guardians came to our assistance by opening the infectious wards of the Workhouse Infirmary for the reception of these cases. Thirty-two cases were treated there, and of these two died. Considering the difficulties experienced by the authorities in providing nurses and attendants at so short a notice, the sanitary and other arrangements were carried out in a most satisfactory manner under the able superintendence of the Medical Officer in charge, Dr. Atkins, Jun., to whom I was indebted for daily reports at this period. When the last patient was discharged the wards were disinfected and cleansed. Not a single case in private dwelling-houses in the immediate neighbourhood of the Infirmary was reported to me, thus showing what can be done to prevent the spread of the disease in the vicinity of small-pox hospitals when the proper sanitary measures are adopted. During the twelve months ending March 31st, 1881, sixty-four patients were removed to hospital from this Hamlet, and 13 deaths occurred 6 from this disease in Mile End, including 2 in the Infirmary and 11 in private dwelling-houses.

The mortality from these diseases shows a marked decrease compared with the mortality occasioned by them during the previous year; thus 65 persons died of measles, compared with 97 for the previous year, and scarlet fever caused 94 deaths only, compared with 134 for the previous year. WHOOPING COUGH AND DIARRHCEA. The deaths from whooping cough and diarrhoea were slightly in excess of those which occurred in the previous year, but on the whole the mortality statistics must certainly be regarded with satisfaction, and may fairly be attributed to a great extent to efficient sanitary work. Diseases of the organs of respiration caused 420 deaths, and of these 155 occurred during the last quarter of the year, during the very inclement waather which we experienced at that period. ARTIZANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS ACT, 1868. I have reported under the provisions of this Act once during the year, viz., six houses in Regent's Place, Maplin Street. I considered these houses to be in a condition dangerous to health and unfit for human habitation, and recommended the usual proceedings to be taken under the Act, and the necessary work was completed under the advice and supervision of your Surveyor. NEW BUILDINGS, DWELLINGS, &c. The following dwelling houses and public buildings have been erected in the Hamlet during the year ending March, 1881. For this return I am indebted to Mr. Charles A. Lcgg, the District Surveyor to the Metropolitan Board. New Dwelling Houses 70 Chapel 1 School Board Building 1 Total 72 Previous Year. New Dwelling Houses 80 WATER SUPPLY. Samples of the water delivered in Mile End by the East London Company have been frequently analysed by Drs. Tidy and Frankland, and have been found of good quality. During the year I received many notices from the Company of the removal of the supples to private houses for the non-payment of rates due to the Company. The want of a proper water supply constitutes a nuisance dangerous to health, and in every case 1 recommended that notice be served to re-instate the supply. 9 In continuation of my remarks upon the water supply, I may observe with reference to the views and recommendations of Colonel Bolton, in a recent monthly report, I have repeatedly called attention in my reports to the danger and injury to health arising from uncovered and dilapidated water-butts and cisterns ; however, they are happily becoming obsolete in this district through the extension of the constant water suppply sytem. I do not, however, consider the present flushingbox arrangement under the constant supply system as sufficiently perfect to ensure safety from contamination of the water by sewer gases, although the apparatus, valves, &c., may appear practically to secure immunity from water contamination ; they are not sufficiently so, they often get out of order, the box may get full of gas which may be absorbed directly into the supply pipe, and in fact the water in the mains—an improvement would be to have a separate cistern outside the closet in addition to that inside, and no connexion with the house supply. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES (ANIMALS) ACT. Cases of foot and mouth disease occurred in several cowsheds in this Hamlet, but having received early information from the Metropolitan Board of Works, and visited the premises, I cautioned the owners to use every precaution that none of the milk from the infected animals should be in any way used for human consumption in accordance with section 8 of the above Act. I believe my instructions were followed in every case, and the disease soon disappeared. I may here add that the milk supplied to Mile End appears to be of good quality. I have certainly failed to trace any case of infectious disease to this source, or of adulteration in any of the samples submitted to me for analysis. In conclusion, I shall not attempt to unduly extend my report by extracts from those of Government officials, but simply congratulate the Yestry and Public of the Hamlet upon the continued maintenance of the prestige of Mile End Old Town for the low death-rate it has so long enjoyed. I beg to tender my thanks to the Vestry, Sanitary Committee, and Officers for their support and assistance in carrying out the responsible and arduous duties I have been called upon to perform during the successive and variedly continuous small pox epidemics which have existed for the past 10 or 12 years.
