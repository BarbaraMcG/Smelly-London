Mr. Mayor, and Gentlemen,— I have the honour to place before you my fifth and last Annual Report on the Health of Battersea. In this, as in my previous Reports, I have endeavoured not only to deal with the facts belonging to the year under report, but also to compare these facts with those recorded in previous years, so that it may be possible to follow the development and progress of the Council's public health work, and also the results of that work. Those results afford legitimate grounds for satisfaction. A remarkable reduction has been effected in the death-rate, the prevalence of diphtheria and enteric fever has been very greatly lessened, and there has been a gratifying fall in the infantile mortality. I am glad to take this opportunity of thanking the Health Committee for their support during my term of office, which I have greatly valued. To the Staff of the Health Department my thanks are due for their help and loyal co-operation, always most willingly given, during the time I have been associated with them in the work of the Department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. F. McCLEARY, Medical Officer of Health. February 15th, 1906. CONTENTS. Page Births, Marriages and Deaths.

Births, Marriages and Deaths. Population. The population of Battersea at the middle of 1905, as estimated by the Registrar-General, was 177,532. This estimate is based on the assumption that the rate of increase of the population during the last intercensal period was maintained during the subsequent years. It is probably somewhat too high, for there are reasons for thinking that the population of Battersea has not increased during the last four years as it did between the years 1891-1901. But the error, if error there be, must be slight, and as there are obvious advantages in adopting the official estimate of the Registrar-General, it has been adopted in this report, and forms the basis of the various mortality and other rates given in the report. Births. The births registered were 4,843 in number, of which .2,425 were males and 2,418 females, the proportion of male to female births being 1,003 to 1,000. The number of births was 264 below the decennial average, and 432 less than the number in 1884, when the population was only 121,299. The births in the sub-districts were as follows*:- Males. Females. Total. The Borough 2,425 2,418 4,843 East Battersea 1,183 1,095 2,278 North-West Battersea 790 832 1,622 South-West Battersea 452 491 943 * East Battersea consists of that portion of the Borough lying Hast of Bridge Road and Latchmere Road, and North of Lavender Hill. North-West Battersea consists of that portion of the Borough lying West of Bridge Road and Latchmere Road, and North of the Windsor Line of the London & South Western Railway. South-West Battersea consists of that portion of the Borough lying South of Lavender Hill and South of the Windsor Line of the London & South Western Railway, and West of Latchmere Road 12 The birth-rate, i.e., the number of births per 1,000 of the population at all ages, was 27.3. This is the lowest birth-rate ever recorded for Battersea, and is no less than 2.9 below the mean birth-rate for the previous ten years. The Battersea birth-rate, which during the ten years 1875-1884 was usually over 40 per 1,000, and in the year 1884 was as high as 43.4 per 1,000, has declined with remarkable rapidity in the last twenty years. The London birth-rate and the birth-rate for England and Wales have also declined considerably, but the decline has been much greater in Battersea, as is shown by the following figures:— Birth-rate per 1,000 Population. Years. England and Wales. London. Battersea. 1876-80 35.4 35.5 40.6 1881-85 33.5 34.2 40.4 1886-90 31.4 32.2 37.0 1891-95 30.5 30.8 32.8 1896-1900 29.3 29.7 31.3 1901-05 28.1 28.1 28.2 The next table shows the birth-rate in the Borough and in each of the sub-districts during the ten years 1893-1904 and in the year 1905. 13 Birth-rate per 1,000 Population.

And it is noteworthy that the decline has been as great in South-West Battersea as in the two districts with a relatively high birthrate, indicating that the decline in our birth-rate is progressive. This is a most important consideration. The significance of the decline in the British birth-rate lies not so much in the fact that we have already reached a low birth-rate, but that there is every reason to believe that in a comparatively short time we 14 shall have descended to a much lower birth-rate. It is not so much the facts recorded, as the tendencies revealed by those facts that constitute the real problem of the decline in our natality. It will be seen from the last table that the birth-rate varies widely in the three registration sub-districts that make up the Borough of Battersea. The variations in the birth-rate are associated, in inverse order, with variations in the standard of comfort, the rate rising as the standard of comfort is lowered. The North-Western sub-district is distinctly the poorest part of Battersea, and it has the highest birth-rate. In East Battersea, although there is much poverty, the standard of comfort is on the whole higher than in North-West Battersea, and the birthrate is lower. South-West Battersea is chiefly occupied by a middle-class population, the working-class element being comparatively small, and it is here that we have the lowest birth-rate recorded in the Borough. It would seem that the influences, whatever they may be, making for a low birth-rate operate with greater force as the standard of comfort of the population rises; and an examination of the variations in the birth-rate in the metropolitan boroughs provides additional support for this hypothesis. With the information at present available, the standard of comfort of a district is perhaps most readily estimated by the proportion of domestic indoor servants to families or separate occupiers ; and in the Census Returns this information is given for each of the metropolitan boroughs. In the next table it will be seen that in the boroughs where the percentage proportion of domestic indoor servants is high the birth-rate is low, and vice-versa. It is evident, however, that there is a source of error in these comparisons if the birth-rate be calculated on the total population. Domestic indoor servants are almost invariably unmarried, and they constitute a non-productive element of the population. Hence, any district having a large proportion of domestic indoor servants may be expected to have a comparatively low birth-rate, if the rate be calculated on the whole population. This source of fallacy can be avoided if we can state 15 the proportion of legitimate births per 1,000 married women living at the ages when they are physiologically capable of bearing children, that is between the ages of 15 and 45, and the proportion of illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried women at the same ages. I have made this calculation for 23 of the metropolitan boroughs and the results are set out in the next table. The figures refer only to the last Census year and the table includes only 23 of the 29 London sanitary districts. The figures for the other districts are either not available, owing to the overlapping of registration areas and sanitary districts, or are rendered untrustworthy by the presence of large lying-in hospitals. The districts are arranged according to the proportion of domestic indoor servants to families or separate occupiers. Census Year, 1901. Metropolitan Borough.

This is no doubt due, to some extent, to the fact that certain districts contain workhouses which are resorted to as lying-in hospitals by women from other districts. The high illegitimate birth-rate in some of the boroughs can be partly explained in this way. The variations in the fertility of the various boroughs are associated with variations in the marriage-rate, and in the proportion of wives under twenty-five years of age to the total population of married women. As we pass from the wealthier to the poorer boroughs, the marriage-rate rises, and so does the proportion of young wives. The percentage of wives under twenty-five to total wives, varies from 9.3 in Hampstead to 17.4 in Stepney. This has an important effect on the birth-rate, for the fertility of wives under twenty-five is much higher than in the later age-periods. These differences are set out in the following table, in which the marriage-rate is calculated not on the total population but on the unmarried persons at marriageable ages. 17 Metropolitan Borough. Proportion per cent of Domestic Indoor Servants to Families or Separate Occupiers. Proportion per cent. of Wives under 25 to Total Wives.

Although in the two preceding tables the metropolitan boroughs have been taken as separate units of population, it would be more correct to regard each borough as a congeries of districts, which, amongst themselves, present differences in natality, greater probably than those which exist amongst the individual boroughs. And it is probable that a careful investigation of these smaller areas, areas occupied by persons of like 18 social condition, and small enough to admit of detailed study, would yield results of greater value than those obtained from the comparison of larger and more heterogeneous areas such as the metropolitan boroughs. As a step in this direction, I have calculated the birth-rates in five of the 126 census enumeration districts which make up the Borough of Battersea. The selected districts were as follows:—District 29 in East Battersea, comprising the group of streets round Belfour Street; districts 9 and to in North-West Battersea, comprising Orville Road and its vicinity; and districts 31 and 35 in South-West Battersea, which include the area at the southern end of Bolingbroke Grove. The three former districts are amongst the poorest, and the two latter amongst the wealthiest portions of the Borough. The percentage proportion of domestic servants to separate occupiers in these districts at the last census was 5, 7.84, 5.35, 71.37, and 84.07 respectively. This percentage, however, must not be taken as a precise indicator of differences in social condition; district 9 is poorer than district 10, although its percentage of domestic servants is slightly higher. The differences in the birth-rates in the year 1905 between the group comprising the three poorer districts, and that made up of the two wealthier districts, are shown in the following table:— Enumeration Districts. Population Census, 1901. Births, 1905. Legitimate. Illegitimate. Birth-rate per 1,000 Population Legitimate Births per 1,000 Married Women aged 15—45. Nos. 9, 10, 29 5,191 179 3 35.06 270.4 No. 31, 35 2,786 25 Nil 8.97 102.0 It will be noted that the rates have been calculated on the census population. This, however, does not vitiate the results, for from my knowledge of these areas I am able to affirm that the number of the inhabitants has not changed materially since 1901. 19 A still more remarkable contrast is seen when the poorest and wealthiest of these five enumeration districts are compared. District 9 in North-West Battersea, which includes Orville Road, is the poorest and most degraded part of the Borough, while on the other hand district 35 in South-West Battersea is the wealthiest. The following table shows how striking is the difference between the birth-rates in the two districts:— Enumeration District. Population Census, 1901. No. of Births. Legitimate. Illegitimate Birth-rate per 1,000 Population. Legitimate Births per 1,000 Married Women aged 15—45. No. 9 1,588 62 2 40.30 302.4 No. 35 1,487 11 Nil 7.39 93.2 Another area which may be profitably studied in this connection is the Latchmere Estate, which consists of 316 workmen's dwellings, erected by the Borough Council in 1903-4. Particulars as to the population of the estate were obtained by a census which was taken in the first week of January, 1906. Most of the tenements are let at rentals of 7s. 6d., 10s. and 10s. 6d. per week, there being also a few houses at a weekly rental of 11s. 6d. The estate is occupied by a working-class population, and most of the workers are engaged in skilled occupations. In the character and intelligence of its inhabitants, the Latchmere Estate compares favourably with any other district in Battersea. The birthrate on the estate in 1905 is given in the following table :— 20 Population, 1905. Births, 1905. Legitimate. Illegitimate. Birth-rate per 1,000 Population. Legitimate Births per 1,000 Married Women aged 15—45. 1,475 39 Nil 26.44 172.5 The birth-rate in this community of skilled workmen is well below the rate of the whole borough, and is much lower than the rates in the three poorer enumeration districts which have been considered. The birth-rate calculated on the number of married women at child-bearing ages, is, however, still more significant. On referring to the table on page 15 it will be seen that in only one of the metropolitan boroughs was a lower rate recorded. The figures on which the three preceding tables are based are small, and too much weight must not be attached to them. If the tables covered a series of years, instead of one year only, the results would be of greater value. Still, it is unlikely that increased data would alter to any considerable extent the results already obtained, and I have no doubt that the rates represent real differences in the fertility of the various districts. Marriages. The marriages registered during the year numbered 1,412, or nineteen more than the decennial average, and fifty-three less than the number in 1904. The marriage-rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 population was 15.9, or .5 below the decennial average. The variations in the marriage-rate since 1895, in Battersea and London, are set out in the next table :— 21 Year. Battersea. London. No. of Marriages. Marriage-rate. Marriage-rate. 1895 1,241 15.2 17.2 1896 1,334 16.1 18.0 1897 1.357 16.2 18.5 1898 1,441 17.2 18.8 1899 1,429 17.0 18.6 1900 1,451 17.2 18.0 1901 1,407 16.6 17.6 1902 1.372 16.0 17.8 1903 1,442 16.6 17.4 1904 1,465 16.7 17.0 Average 1895-1904 1,393 16.4 17.8 1905 1,412 15.9 Deaths. During the year 2,542 deaths were registered. This number includes 399 deaths of non-residents occurring in public institutions in the district. Deducting these and adding 418 deaths of Battersea residents registered in public institutions outside the district, a net total of 2,561 deaths (males 1,297, females 1,264) is obtained. This gives a death-rate of 14.4, which is equal to the rate in the previous year. In only one year has a lower death-rate been recorded in Battersea. This was in 1903, when the death-rate was 14.2. 1,159 deaths belong to East Battersea, 873 to North-West Battersea, and 529 to South-West Battersea. 22 The number of deaths of males and females registered in each quarter of the year is set out as follows — Males. Females. Total.

The deaths of Battersea residents occurring in public institutions numbered 777. 359 occurred within, and 418 without the Borough. 422 deaths occurred in Workhouses or Workhouse Infirmaries, as against 415 in 1904, and 348 in 1903. The table on page 24 gives a list of the institutions in which the deaths occurred.

The deaths of infants under one year numbered 633, and formed 24 7 per cen. of the total deaths. The "infantile mortality," i.e., the number of deaths under one year per 1,000 births registered, was 131, being 26 below the decennial average. This is the lowest infantile mortality ever recorded in Battersea, and it would have been still lower had it not been for a severe epidemic of measles in the second quarter of the year. The infantile mortality in the County of London was 129. The mortality in the Borough and in each of the subdistricts is given in the following table:— TABLE Year. The Borough. East Battersea. North-West Battersea. South-West Battersea. Deaths under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births. Deaths under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births. Deaths under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births.

This is partly due to the fact that the epidemic of measles to which reference has already been made, was particularly fatal in North-West Battersea. The chief causes of infant deaths are set out as follows:— Cause of Death. No. of Deaths. Rate per 1,000 Births, 1905. Rate per 1,000 Births, 1904. Rate per 1,000 Births, 1903.

The mortality from the latter cause shows a distinct increase since 1901, when it was 19.9 per 1,000 births. Since the end of 1904, the local registrars have supplied the Council with weekly returns, giving the home addresses of all infants born in the Borough, and many of these homes are visited by Mrs. Young, who gives practical instruction to the mothers in the feeding and rearing of infants. 909 homes were visited by Mrs. Young during the year. In England, however, births need not be registered until forty-two days from the date of birth, and many infants have died before the homes can be visited by the officers of the Sanitary Authority; but in London, this difficulty has been met to a large extent by 28 the action of the London County Council, who now supply to the Sanitary Authorities, weekly lists of births attended by midwives during the preceding week. This information, which the County Council are able to obtain as the local supervising authority under the Midwives Act, is of very great value, and will no doubt contribute materially to the resources of the Sanitary Authorities in their struggle for the reduction of infantile mortality. The premises where deaths of infants under one year have occurred are visited by Miss Dawson, who makes a written report on each case to the Medical Officer of Health, and takes steps to remedy any insanitary conditions discovered on the premises. Seven deaths were recorded as due to suffocation in bed or "over-lying." The following table gives the number of deaths from this cause, occurring on each day of the week in each year since 1896. The day refers to the morning on which the death was discovered, and it will be seen that by far the greater number of deaths were discovered on Sunday morning. This suggests that the over-lying takes place when the parents are under the influence of alcohol, and there are other facts which support this view. These deaths should be taken into account, therefore, in estimating the mortality due to alcohol. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902. 1903 1904. 1905 Total Sunday 6 4 3 4 4 5 3 — 3 2 34 Monday 4 3 3 1 3 3 2 — — 1 19 Tuesday 4 4 2 1 1 1 1 — 1 2 17 Wednesday 1 5 4 4 1 1 — — — — 16 Thursday 1 1 2 2 4 3 1 — 1 1 16 Friday 4 1 4 1 2 2 1 — — — 15 Saturday — 3 — 3 2 2 1 1— 1 13 Total 20 21 18 17 15 17 9 1 5 7 130 29 This year the Local Government Board require a table on infantile mortality in addition to the four tables hitherto required in the annual reports of Medical Officers of Health. The new table contains statistics as to the causes of infantile deaths at various periods under one year, in the whole sanitary district and in its sub-divisions. This table will be found on pages 169-172 of the report. Senile Mortality. Five hundred and thirty-seven deaths of Battersea residents occurred at ages of sixty-five and upwards. The age distribution of these deaths in the sub-districts is given below:— District. 65 and under 75. 75 and under 85. 85 and upwards. Total over 65.

The 537 deaths over sixty-five in 1905 were equivalent to 21 per cent, of the deaths at all ages. The Vital Statistics of the Latchmere Estate. At the instance of the Health Committee and with the consent of the Housing Committee, a census of the Latchmere Estate was taken in the first week of January, 1906, by the Officers of the Health Department. The estate consists of 316 workmen's dwellings, which were erected by the Borough Council in 1903-4, and are occupied by a working-class population, nearly all the workers being engaged in skilled occupations. The population living on the estate was found to number 1,475 persons, whose age and sex distribution was as follows:— MALES. 0- 5- 10- 15- 25- 35- 45- 55- Total.

This gives a birth-rate of 26.44 per 1,000 persons, and a legitimate birth-rate of 172.5 per 1,000 married women at child-bearing ages, viz., from fifteen to forty-five years. The number of deaths on the estate was 15, and the causes of death were as follows:— Measles 3 deaths Phthisis 3 ,, Bronchitis, and Pneumonia 3 ,, Premature birth 2 ,, Hemiplegia 1 ,, Mastoid disease 1 ,, Diphtheria 1 ,, Gastro-enteritis 1 ,, The death-rate per 1,000 population was 10.16. Three deaths occurred of infants under one year, the infantile mortality being 77 per 1,000 births registered. It should be remembered that the numbers recorded above are small, and that a few deaths more or less would have made a considerable difference in the death-rates. When the figures for a series of years are available the results will be much more trustworthy. Battersea Borough Council. Chart indicating the prevalence of notifiable infectious disease during each week of the year 1905. Infectious and other Diseases. 35 Infectious and other Diseases. Causes of Death. The causes of death are tabulated in Table IV. of the Local Government Board series, see page 168, and are set out in greater detail in Table VI. Zymotic Mortality. The table below shows the deaths from the chief zymotic diseases for the ten years 1895-1904, and the year 1905 respectively. The total number of deaths from these diseases was 375, a number which is considerably less than the decennial average, and compares favourably with the totals recorded in most of the years included in the table. The mortality would have been one of the lowest in the table had it not been for the exceptionally high number of deaths from measles. No death from small-pox occurred in 1905: this and the great and progressive reduction in the mortality from diphtheria and enteric fever are the most satisfactory facts recorded in the table.

It will be seen from this table that in 1905 there was a great reduction in the death-rate from diphtheria as compared with the death-rate for the preceding ten years. There was a considerable reduction also in the case of enteric fever, diarrhœa, and whooping cough, while small-pox did not give rise to a single death. On the other hand, there was an increased mortality from measles, erysipelas, scarlet fever and puerperal fever. The death-rate from the seven principal zymotic diseases—viz., small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, enteric fever, measles, whooping cough and diarrhœa was 1.93, the death-rate from these diseases in the County of London being 1.68. 38 Notifiable Infectious Disease. Compulsory notification of certain infectious diseases came into force in Battersea in the year 1889 by the adoption of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. The diseases made notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act are:—Small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria and membranous croup, cholera, erysipelas, typhus, typhoid, continued, relapsing and puerperal fevers. By an order of the Local Government Board, 19th September, 1900, bubonic plague was also made notifiable. The number of cases notified during the year was 1,186: In East Battersea, 598 cases were notified; in North-West Battersea, 352; in South-West Battersea, 236. The number of cases notified and the proportion per 1,000 population are set out as follows:— Total number of cases notified. Notifications per 1,000 of the population. The Borough 1,186 6.6 East Battersea 598 3.3 North-West Battersea 352 1.9 South-West Battersea 236 1.3 No cases of small-pox, typhus fever, continued fever, relapsing fever, cholera, or plague were notified.

No case of Small-pox occurred during 1905 in Battersea, although 74 cases, 10 of which were fatal, occurred in the County of London. On 14 occasions I was asked by medical practitioners to see patients suspected to be suffering from small-pox, but on each occasion the patient was found to be suffering from chicken-pox, or from some other disease which was not small-pox. 43 The following table gives the number of small-pox cases and deaths in Battersea and in the county of London since 1891:- Year.

The number of cases per 1,000 population in the County of London was 4.15 and the death-rate 0.12. The following gives the age distribution of the cases notified, and of the fatal cases:— Age Periods-Years. Total.

In 1904, 86.6 per cent., and in 1903, 83.9 per cent. of the cases notified were removed to hospital. In the sub-districts the percentage of cases removed 45 to total cases was as follows:—East Battersea, 967; North-West Battersea, 96.3; South-West Battersea, 82.8. The percentage of cases removed to hospital, 93.8, is considerably higher than the number recorded in any previous year. In East and North-West Battersea nearly all the patients notified were isolated in hospital. In no case was compulsion employed, or even threatened, to effect removal. During the year 1905, scarlet fever was usually prevalent in Battersea and in the County of London generally. The number of cases notified began to increase in August, reached a maximum in the latter part of October and then began slowly to decline. The case-rate, i.e., the number of cases notified per 1,000 population, was 4.51, a figure which although higher than those of the two preceding years, is well below the case-rate in 1902, and is much less than the rate in the years before 1898. In 144 cases there was a definite history of exposure to infection from a previous case, in 55 other cases there were good reasons for suspecting school infection, 23 were "return" cases and 17 cases were infected outside Battersea. In the remaining cases no information as to the source of infection could be obtained. One case in the first-mentioned group was that of a father who was infected while visiting his child who was dangerously ill at the hospital. Of the school cases 16 occurred in a large boarding school in the district, while in the remaining cases the patients were children attending elementary schools. One of the latter cases, a boy who had had a mild unrecognised attack of scarlet fever, was discovered by his teacher while in class pulling large pieces of skin from his hands. He and his brother were at once taken home, and when I visited the house shortly afterwards I found both boys to be in the desquamating stage of scarlet fever. Owing to the prevalence of scarlet fever one class-room in the Infants' Department of Mantua Street School, two classrooms in the Girls' Department of Latchmere School, and the 46 whole of the Infants' Department of Battersea Park Road School were closed, by arrangement with the Education Department of the London County Council, for periods of two weeks, one week, and two weeks respectively, and the class-rooms, lavatories, &c., were disinfected by the Borough Council. Several class-rooms, &c., were also disinfected in St. Joseph's School. Twenty-four cases of scarlet fever occurred at periods varying from one to thirty-one days after the return to the same house of a patient discharged from hospital after an attack of scarlet fever. In 23 of these cases no other source of infection could be discovered, and it is probable that, in some of them at all events, the infection was derived from the discharged patient. Since the year 1903 it has been the practice of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to furnish the London Medical Officers of Health with returns giving the dates on which it is proposed to discharge from hospital recovered cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria, and it is now one of Miss Dawson's duties to visit the homes to which recovered patients are to return, and to advise the mothers to take certain precautions; for instance, not to allow the child to sleep with other children soon after his return. She also ascertains to what school it is proposed to send the patient, and a letter is then addressed to the Head Teacher requesting that the child be excluded from school for a fortnight after his return home. This procedure appears to have had a beneficial effect. The importance of preventing the occurrence of return cases is appreciated by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, who in 1901 appointed Dr. Cameron to investigate and report upon the question. In 1905 Dr. Cameron's report was printed and circulated to the London Sanitary Authorities. As a result of the report the Board have already modified the arrangements made for discharging patients from hospital, and it is to be hoped that these cases may become much fewer in the future. In Battersea the figures relating to return cases in 1905 compare favourably with those in previous years, showing, one may hope, 47 that progress is already being made to reduce the occurrence of these important cases. The number of suspected return cases in 1904 was sixteen, or 4 26 per cent. of the total cases notified; in 1905 the return cases were 23, or only 2 87 per cent. of the total cases. In 48 of the cases notified as suffering from scarlet fever, the diagnosis was found to be erroneous and the patients were sent back from hospital. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. The case-rate, death-rate and case-mortality from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup since 1891 are set out in the following table:— Year. Cases. Case-rate per 1,000 population. Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000 population.

In the County of London the case-rate was 1.38, the death-rate 0.12, and the case-mortality 8.41 per cent. 48 The number of cases removed to hospital was 142, or 83.7 per cent, of the total number of cases notified. In 1904 the percentage of cases removed to hospital was 77.8, and in 1903 81.9. The percentage of cases removed in the sub-districts was as follows:—East Battersea, 91.9; North-West Battersea, 98.1; South-West Battersea, 69.5. Eight deaths occurred in hospital, and 3 at home, the case-mortality at hospital and at home being 5.5 and 14.2 respectively. The following table gives the age distribution of the cases notified, and of the fatal cases :— Age Periods—Years.

In 31 houses the drainage was defective, and in 58, insanitary conditions other than drainage defects were found. In 12 cases a history of direct personal infection was obtained. In addition to these, 3 cases imported the disease from other districts, 2 were cases of post-scarlatinal diphtheria which developed in a fever hospital when the patients were recovering from attacks of scarlet fever, and one case was possibly a "return" case. Twenty-four cases notified as suffering from diphtheria and removed to hospital were found not to be so suffering, and were returned home. The table on page 47 shows a great reduction in the caserate, death-rate, and case-mortality from diphtheria. This reduction is one of the most satisfactory features of the Battersea statistics. One hundred and sixty-five bacteriological examinations were made, 50 of which gave a positive and 115 a negative result. 49 Enteric Fever. I he case-rate, death-rate and case-mortality from Enteric Fever since 1891 are set out in the following table :— Year. Cases. Case-rate per 1,000 population Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000 population.

The death-rate and case-rate in the sub-districts are set out below:— Case-rate per 1,000 population. Death-rate per 1,000 population. East Battersea 0.16 0.04 North-West Battersea 0.18 0.04 South-West Battersea 0.11 0.01 In the County of London the case-rate was 0.33, and the death-rate 0.05. 50 Nineteen cases, or 70.3 per cent. of the total were removed to hospital, compared with 8o.3 per cent, in 1904, and 69.4 per cent. in 1903. In 2 instances the infection was found to have been derived from a previous case of the disease in the Borough, and in 4 other cases the patient was infected outside Battersea. One of these patients was infected in Lincoln during the epidemic in that city. In 5 other cases there were reasons for suspecting shell-fish as carrying the infection. The number of houses invaded by the disease was 25. In 4 houses the drainage was found to be defective, and in 10 houses defects other than drainage defects were found to exist. Facilities for bacteriological diagnosis are supplied gratis by the Council to all medical practitioners in Battersea. Each practitioner is supplied with an outfit containing appliances for taking a specimen of blood for examination by the Widal test. The practitioner is apprised of the result of the examination by telegram, and the outfit is returned re-filled. Thirty-one doubtful cases were examined, with a positive result in 7, and a negative result in 24 cases. Puerperal Fever. The number of cases notified was 16, that number being 10 above the decennial average. Eight cases were notified in 1904 and 7 cases in 1903. The case-rate was .09, or .04 above the mean case-rate for the preceding ten years, which was .05. Nine cases were fatal. The death-rate was .05, or .03 above the decennial average, .02. The death-rate for London was .05. Nine cases occurred in East Battersea, 4 in North-West Battersea, and 3 in South-West Battersea. The Midwives Act, 1902, contains some important provisions which should tend materially to lower the prevalence of puerperal fever. In London the Act is administered by the London County Council, who are the local supervising authority, but the important work of disinfection devolves upon the Sanitary Authorities. One of the tenements in the Reception Shelter in Sheepcote Lane is used for personal disinfection after puerperal fever, and during the year three midwives who had 51 been in attendance on cases of puerperal fever attended the shelter and had disinfectant baths; while their instruments, instrument-bags, personal clothing, &c., were disinfected at the Disinfecting Station. This disinfection can be enforced under Rule 5 of the Rules framed by the Central Midwives Board. Three nurses who had been nursing puerperal fever cases were also disinfected at the shelter during the year. Erysipelas. One hundred and seventy-six cases were notified, 24 of which were fatal. The case-rate was .99, or .14 below the decennial average; and the death-rate .13, or .06 above the decennial average. Fifty-six cases were removed to hospital, the majority going to Union infirmaries, and the remainder to general hospitals. Measles. The deaths from this disease numbered 124, or 19 above the decennial average. Fifty-three deaths occurred in East Battersea, 67 in North-West Battersea, and 4 in South-West Battersea. The death-rate was .70, as compared with .61, the mean death-rate for the preceding ten years, and .36 the death-rate in the County of London. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:—East Battersea, .71; North-West Battersea, 1.35; South-West Battersea, .07. Thirty-one deaths were of infants under one year, 87 of children aged from one to five years, and 6 deaths occurred among children aged from five to ten years. The deaths in each of the four quarters of the year were as follows:— First quarter 11 Second ,, 87 Third ,, 11 Fourth ,, 15 Measles began to be prevalent in Battersea at the end of the first quarter of the year. The disease travelled eastward through Roehampton, Putney and Wandsworth, and crossed Battersea from west to east. The severity of the disease 52 varied considerably in different districts. In North-West Battersea there were many deaths, and the death-rate was as high as 1.35; in East Battersea, on the other hand, the disease was considerably milder in type. On 20th January, 1903, the London County Council made an Order which had the effect of applying to Measles practically all the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to the prevention of infectious disease, except notification. This order came in force on 1st April, 1903. No provision for notification is made in the County Council's order, but many cases are reported to the Medical Officer of Health by the Head Teachers in the elementary schools. The total number of cases reported in this way in 1905 was 900, the number reported from each school being as follows:— Name of School. No. Cases Basnett Road 74 Battersea Park Road 54 Bolingbroke Road 14 Christ Church 4 Ethelburga Street 18 Gideon Road 4 Holden Street 5 Honeywell Road 10 The Latchmere 63 Lavender Hill 89 Mantua Street 74 New Road 4 Plough Road 50 Raywood Street 86 St. Andrew's Street 7 St. John's 11 St. Mark's 30 St. Mary's (Green Lane) 36 The Sacred Heart 8 Shillington Street 15 Sleaford Street 50 Surrey Lane 14 Tennyson Street 61 Winstanley Road 48 Wix Lane 71 Total 900 53 Owing to the prevalence of measles, the Infants' Department of St. Mark's School, and class-rooms in the Infants' Department of Mantua Street School and Wix's Lane School were closed and disinfected. The Infants' Department of Christ Church and Basnett Road Schools, and the Battersea Park Tabernacle Sunday School, were also disinfected. All the cases reported are visited by the inspectors; most of this work is done by Miss Dawson, who endeavours to secure such measures of isolation as are possible, and disinfection is carried out after each case. The total number of premises disinfected after measles was 1,237. The followingleaflet is handed to the person responsible for the care of the patient:— BATTERSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL. Measles. An important alteration in the law relating to Measles has lately been made, the main provisions of which are set out below. Any person offending against these provisions becomes liable to a heavy penalty. 1. A person in charge of a patient suffering from Measles must not place the patient in any public conveyance, or expose the patient in any street, public place, shop or inn. 2. It is illegal to give, lend, sell, transmit, remove or expose without previous disinfection, any bedding, clothing, or other articles which have been exposed to infection from Measles. A person must not knowingly cast, or cause or permit to be cast into any ashpit any rubbish infected by Measles without previous disinfection. 4. A person must not knowingly let a house or part of a house in which any person has been suffering from Measles until the premises and all articles therein liable to retain infection have been disinfected. 54 5. A person ceasing to occupy a house or part of a house in which any person has within six weeks previously been suffering from Measles must have the premises and all articles therein liable to retain infection disinfected and notice of the disease must be given to the owner or master of the house. The above provisions also apply to the following diseases:— Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas. Measles is a very serious and fatal disease. It causes many more deaths than Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. Bronchitis and Inflammation of the Lungs are common complications of Measles, and cause many deaths. It is a great mistake to treat Measles as a disease of little consequence. When a case of Measles has occurred in a house, a careful look-out should be kept on the other children, so that, on the first appearance of illness they may be kept at home and properly treated. When a patient is suffering from Measles, no neighbour's child, or neighbour accompanied by a child, should be admitted into the house, and the provisions set out above must be strictly observed. By order, G. F. McCLEARY, Medical Officer of Health. Whooping Cough. Whooping Cough caused 49 deaths during the year, or 29 less than the decennial average. The deaths were equivalent to a death-rate of .28 per 1,000, or .18 lower than the mean death-rate for the preceding ten years, which was .46. The death-rate in the County of London was .32. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows:— East Battersea, .27; North-West Battersea, .42; South-West Battersea, .15. Seventeen deaths were of infants under one year, and 30 55 of children from one to five. The deaths in each quarter of the year were as follows:— First quarter 10 Second ,, 16 Third ,, 14 Fourth ,, 9 Diarrhœa. Diarrhoea was the cause of 128 deaths, including 55 registered as due to epidemic or zymotic enteritis. The death-rate was .72 per 1,000, or .14 below the decennial average .86. The death-rate in the County of London was .72. The number of deaths and the death-rate in the subdistricts are set out below:— [### ]No. of Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000.

The deaths in each quarter of the year were as follows:— First quarter 3 Second ,, — Third ,, 116 Fourth ,, 9 In the early part of July the following leaflet was delivered to every house in the borough:— BATTERSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL. How to Prevent Diarrhœa. Diarrhoea is caused by eating food which has been contaminated by germs. The germs are carried by dust and dirt, and the way to prevent Diarrhoea is to keep your house and everything in it scrupulously clean. Do not allow dirt and dust to accumulate in the yard. Put the dust in the dust-bin, and see that the dust-bin is kept covered. Burn all animal and vegetable refuse. 56 Boil all your milk as soon as it comes into the house. This will kill any germs that may be in the milk. Then keep it covered so as to prevent other germs from getting in. Do not eat tainted meat. Keep your cistern clean, and boil your drinking water. Thousands of hand-fed babies die from Diarrhœa every summer, but breast-fed babies are seldom attacked. It is, therefore, particularly important that babies should be fed from the mother's breast during the hot weather. By Order of the Health Committee, G. F. McCLEARY, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

Disinfection was carried out in 38 per cent. of the fatal cases occurring in private houses. 58 Sixty-six specimens of sputum from doubtful cases of consumption were submitted to bacteriological examination, the result being positive in 18, and negative in 48 cases. Cancer. The following table gives the deaths and the death-rate from Cancer since 1893. The table appears to show an increased mortality from Cancer during the decennium, but the increase may possibly be due, to some extent, to improved diagnosis and certification. Year. Deaths.

On May 11th, 1905, an inquest was held on the body of a lad aged fourteen, late of Hope Street. A post-mortem examination was made by Dr. Freyberger, who came to the conclusion that the deceased had died of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. Through the kindness of Dr. Freyberger, I was able to attend the autopsy and remove portions of the meninges, brain, and spinal cord, for bacteriological examination. The specimens; were examined by the Clinical Research Association for the diplococcus intracellularis, and also for the tubercle bacillus, but neither organism could be found. The clinical history of the case was as follows:— The deceased, though not robust, was apparently in good health 60 until May 7th, when he sprained his right ankle. Except for this injury, however, he complained of nothing until the evening of the following day, May 8th, when he was taken ill with headache and other symptoms of fever. On the morning of May 9th, he had a fit and became unconscious, in which condition he remained until his death at 1.45 the same day. His head was retracted, and the symptoms generally pointed to cerebro-spinal meningitis. No source of infection could be traced. An undoubted case of the disease had occurred at Richmond some six weeks before, but careful enquiry could trace no connection between the two cases. In view of the negative results of the bacteriological examinations, the evidence that this case was really one of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, or "spotted fever" cannot be regarded as conclusive; but every precaution was taken to prevent a possible spread of the disease. The premises were disinfected throughout, and the contacts kept under observation. A memorandum by the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, describing the clinical features of the disease, was circulated to all the medical practitioners in the borough. Nine suspected cases of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis were reported to me by medical practitioners, but in every case the patient was found to be suffering from some other disease. Alcoholism. Six deaths were returned as due to acute and chronic alcoholism, 5 of the cases being males, and 1 a female. Twentyfour deaths (males 13, females 11) were due to cirrhosis of the liver, a disease which, in practically every case, is caused by alcohol. This gives a total of 30 cases in which alcohol was the cause of death, as against 31 in 1904, but there is no doubt that this number greatly understates the real mortality from alcoholism. Deaths really due to this cause are usually certified under less invidious headings such as apoplexy, Bright's disease, heart disease, &c. 61 The mortality from alcohol cannot, therefore, be even approximately estimated from the death returns. The deaths from over-lying must be considered in this connection. There are reasons for thinking that much of the mortality of infants suffocated while in bed with their parents may be attributed to drunkenness on the part of the parents. Alcoholism is probably a greater danger to the public health than anything which is usually included under the term "insanitary conditions," and it is gratifying to note that the Sanitary Authorities are now making a direct attack on this most potent enemy of our national well-being. During the year 1905, many Sanitary Authorities published placards calling attention to the dangers of alcohol. Battersea was one of the first to take this step, and the placard published was in the following terms:— BATTERSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL. Physical Deterioration and Alcoholism. The Report of the Committee on Physical Deterioration, presented to Parliament by command of His Majesty, states that: The abuse of alcoholic stimulants is a most potent and deadly agent of physical deterioration. Alcoholic persons are specially liable to Tuberculosis and all inflammatory disorders; Evidence was placed before the Committee shewing that in Abstinence is to be sought the source of muscular vigour and dexterity ; The lunacy figures shew a large and increasing number of admissions of both sexes which are due to drink. The following facts recognised by the Medical profession and placarded all over France by order of the Government, are published in order to carry out the recommendation of the Committee to bring home to the community the fatal effects of alcohol on physical efficiency:— (1) Alcoholism is a chronic poisoning, resulting from the habitual use of alcohol (whether as spirits, wine or beer), which may never go as far as drunkenness. 62 (2) It is a mistake to say that those doing hard work require stimulants. As a fact no one requires alcohol as either food or tonic. (3) Alcohol is really a narcotic, dulling the nerves like laudanum or opium, but it is more dangerous than either in that often its first effect is to weaken a man's selfcontrol while his passions are excited: hence the number of crimes which occur under its influence. (4) Spirits, as usually taken, rapidly produce alcoholism, but milder alcoholic drinks as beer, and even cider, drunk repeatedly every day, produce after a time alcoholic poisoning with equal certainty. (5) The habit of drinking leads to the ruin of families, the neglect of social duties, disgust of work, misery, theft and crime. It leads also to the hospital, for alcohol produces the most various and the most fatal diseases, including Paralysis, Insanity, diseases of the Stomach and Liver, and Dropsy. It also paves the way to Consumption, and frequenters of public houses furnish a large proportion of the victims of this disease. It complicates and aggravates all acute diseases; Typhoid Fever, Pneumonia and Erysipelas are rapidly fatal in the subject of alcoholism. (6) In short, alcoholism is the most terrible enemy to personal health, to family happiness, and to national prosperity. Bacteriological Examination. By arrangement with the Clinical Research Association, medical practitioners practising in the Borough have been afforded facilities for the bacteriological examination of specimens from suspected cases of diphtheria, enteric fever, and phthisis. The cost of the examinations is borne by the Council. Practitioners may also, by arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health, submit to the Association specimens from patients suspected to be suffering from diseases other than the three mentioned above. 63 The following table gives particulars as to the examinations made during the year 1905. Suspected disease. Positive Results. Negative Results. Total.

This is the greatest number of houses inspected in this way in any one year in Battersea. The following figures show the number of houses inspected in each year since 1899:— 1899 3,400 1900 3,009 1901 3,116 1902 1,740 1903 2,670 1904 3,020 1905 4,503 The falling-off in the house-to-house inspection in the year 1902 was due to the small-pox outbreak, which provided plenty of work for the sanitary staff in other directions. The total number of houses in Battersea at the present time is about 24,500, and if the rate of house-to-house inspection that obtained in 1905 were maintained in subsequent years, it would be possible to inspect every house in the borough once in every five and a half years. It is not the practice in Battersea, however, to visit each street one after another, irrespective of sanitary conditions, until every street in the borough has been inspected. It is necessary to inspect some streets every year, many require inspection at least once in two years, while others may be left for a longer interval. It may be said, however, that no house in the borough should be left unvisited for a longer period than five years, and if this standard be adopted, and if at the same time the more frequent inspection of streets demanding special attention be continued, it is obvious that house-to-house inspection must be carried on with even greater vigour than in 1905. Mrs. Young and Miss Dawson made a considerable number of house-to-house inspections, and Inspector Baxter in addition to his work in his own district carried out a special inspection of certain selected streets in No. 2 district. 70 Houses Let in Lodgings. The number of houses on the register is 121. No new houses were added in 1905, it being thought inexpedient to add to the register before the revised bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings came into operation, and these bye-laws were not confirmed by the Local Government Board until 22nd December. These bye-laws have been the subject of much discussion and negotiation, which it may be useful briefly to recapitulate. The administration of the law relating to houses let in lodgings was considered by the Health Committee at some length in 1902, and it was decided that before such houses could be dealt with effectively it would be necessary to make several important amendments in the bye-laws in force at that time. Accordingly in March, 1903, the Council adopted a revised set of bye-laws and submitted them to the Local Government Board for confirmation. The revised bye-laws differed from those then in force in several respects, the most important points of difference being as follows:— 1. The exemption clause was omitted. This alteration met with considerable opposition, but there was no lack of precedent for it, for the bye-laws of no less than five Metropolitan Boroughs contain no exemption clause whatever. These Boroughs are Bermondsey, Deptford, Kensington, Marylebone, Stepney. 2. The term "Landlord" was defined to mean the owner of the lodging-house, and a new term "master" was used to denote the person "by whom or on whose behalf the lodginghouse is let in lodgings or for occupation by members of more than one family, or who for the time being receives or is entitled to receive the profits arising from the said letting." This term "master" was derived from section 141 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, where it is used in a similar sense; but at the suggestion of the Local Government Board it was afterwards altered to " keeper." 3. The standard of cubic air space per adult was raised 71 from 300 to 400 cubic feet in rooms occupied exclusively as sleeping-rooms, and from 400 to 500 cubic feet in rooms not used exclusively for that purpose; the standard for a child under 10 years being in each case one half that for an adult. In July, 1903, a letter was received from the Local Government Board in which no objection was raised to the proposed amendments, except the omission of the exemption clause. The Board suggested that the administrative difficulties which had induced the Council to omit this clause might be met by an amendment of the clause rather than by its omission. The Council in reply proposed a clause which would have had the effect of exempting all houses except those that the Council had decided to place upon the register. An exemption clause to this effect formed part of the bye-laws then in force in the following Boroughs:— Bethnal Green, Chelsea, Hampstead, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, St. Pancras and Shoreditch; and this clause would have given the Council the freedom of registration which was desired. The Board, however, replied that this was a clause to which they had had to take exception in recent years in several cases, and that they were not prepared to assent to it, and they suggested that the matter might be discussed at a conference between their officials and the Council's officers. After this conference, which was held on 1st December, 1903, the Board suggested a clause exempting all houses except those "where the keeper resides on the premises and where in addition to such keeper and his family there are not more than two persons lodging in such house." The Council accepted this alteration and submitted the amended bye-laws to the Board for confirmation on 14th January, 1904. On 3rd February, 1904, two important decisions were given in the High Court which made it necessary again to revise the bye-laws. In these cases, Stiles v. Galinski, and Nokes and Nokes v. the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of Islington, it was held that bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings were bad if they did not provide that a notice should be served on the landlord before he could be held responsible 72 for any failure to comply with the provisions of the bye-laws. By this decision both the existing and the revised bye-laws became useless, for although it had always been the practice in Battersea to serve a notice on the landlord to carry out the necessary cleansing, &c., there was no provision to this effect in our bye-laws, nor, so far as I am aware, in any bye-laws in force at that time. In May, 1904, the Local Government Board forwarded to the Council a revised set of model bye-laws, in which the difficulty raised by the High Court decisions was met by the introduction of a new clause providing that no proceedings should be taken against the landlord (or keeper) for an offence against any of the bye-laws unless and until the Council had served on him a notice requiring him to comply with the bye-laws within a reasonable time. The Council again revised the bye-laws by the introduction of this new clause, and the consequential additions to other clauses, and submitted the bye-laws thus revised to the Board. In October, 1904, the Health Committee received a Deputation from the Battersea Municipal Alliance, who expressed strong objections to three points in the revised bye-laws, namely: the definition of the term "landlord," the absence of a rental exemption limit, and the raising of the standard of cubic air space. The Alliance subsequently embodied their objections in a memorandum addressed to the Local Government Board, and a copy of this memorandum was forwarded to the Council by the Board, who subsequently forwarded a similar memorandum which they had received from the Incorporated Association for the Protection of Property Owners. In view of the strong objections to the new bye-laws the Board held a Local Inquiry on 14th July, 1905, and to meet the objections brought forward at the Inquiry it was proposed on behalf of the Council to amend the exemption clause so as to provide for the exemption of a lodging-house, where, in addition to the keeper and his family, there are not more than three (instead of two as formerly proposed) persons lodging in the house, and to lower the standards of cubic air space from 400 and 500 cubic feet to 350 and 450 respectively; these being the standards adopted in the bye-laws already in force in the City 73 of London. The Board subsequently stated that they were prepared to assent to these alterations, and on 22nd December the bye-laws, as finally revised, received the confirmation of the Board. The bye-laws, as confirmed by the Local Government Board, are given below. 1. In these bye-laws, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words and expressions have the meanings hereinafter respectively assigned to them; that is to say:— "Council" means the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea. "Lodging-house" means a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. "Landlord," in relation to a lodging-house, means the person (whatever may be the nature or extent of his interest in the premises) who receives, or is entitled to receive the rack rent of a lodging-house. "Keeper," in relation to a lodging-house, means the person (whatever may be the nature or extent of his interest in the premises) by whom or on whose behalf the lodging-house is let in lodgings or for occupation by members of more than one family, or who for the time being receives or is entitled to receive the profits arising from the said letting. "Lodger," in relation to a lodging-house, means a person to whom any room or rooms in the lodging-house may have been let as a lodging or for his use and occupation. 2. A lodging-house shall be exempt from the operation of these bye-laws where the keeper resides on the premises, and where in addition to such keeper and his family there are not more than three persons lodging in such house. (a.) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family: 74 (b.) For the registration of houses so let or occupied: (c.) For the inspection of such houses: (d.) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses: (e.) For the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises: (f.) For the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease. 3. A lodger in a lodging-house and, subject to the provisions of these bye-laws the keeper of the lodging-house or, where there is no keeper and the landlord resides on the premises, the landlord of the lodging-house shall not knowingly cause or suffer a greater number of persons than will admit of the provision of three hundred and fifty cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age exceeding ten years, and of one hundred and seventy-five cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age not exceeding ten years to occupy, at any one time, as a sleeping apartment, a room which is used exclusively for that purpose, and which in the case of the lodger has been let to such lodger. 4. A lodger in a lodging-house and, subject to the provisions of these bye-laws the keeper of the lodging-house or, where there is no keeper and the landlord resides on the premises, the landlord of the lodging-house shall not knowingly cause or suffer a greater number of persons than will admit of the provision of four hundred and fifty cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age exceeding ten years, and of two hundred and twenty-five cubic feet of free air space for each person of an age not exceeding ten years to occupy, at any one time, as a sleeping apartment, a room which is not used exclusively for that purpose, and which in the case of the lodger has been let to that lodger. 5. The keeper, or where there is no keeper, the landlord, of a lodging-house, within a period of fourteen days after he shall have been required by a notice in writing, signed by the Town Clerk and duly served upon or delivered to such keeper or landlord as the case may be, to supply the information 75 necessary for the registration of the lodging-house by the Council, shall, himself, or by his agent duly authorised in that behalf, sign and furnish to the Council a true statement of the following particulars with respect to the lodging-house; that is to say— (a.) The total number of rooms in the house: (b.) The total number of rooms let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family: (c.) The manner of use of each room: (d.) The number, age, and sex of the occupants of each room used for sleeping: (e.) The Christian name and surname of the lessee of each room; and (/.) The amount of rent or charge per week payable by each lessee. 6. In any case where the landlord of a lodging-house resides in any part of the premises, the landlord, and in any case where the landlord of a lodging-house does not reside in any part of the premises, every keeper or lodger who is entitled to have or to exercise the control of the outer door of the premises shall, at all times when required by the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or any other officer specially appointed or authorised by the Council in that behalf, afford any such officer free access to the interior of the premises for the purpose of inspection. 7. Every lodger in a lodging-house shall, at all times when required by the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or any other officer specially appointed or authorised by the Council in that behalf, afford any such officer free access for the purpose of inspection to the interior of any room or rooms which may have been let to the lodger. 8. Where the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or any other officer specially appointed or authorised by the Council in that behalf, has, for the purpose of inspection, obtained access to the interior of a lodging-house or to the 76 interior of any room or rooms in a lodging-house, a person shall not wilfully obstruct any such officer in the inspection of any part of the premises, or, without reasonable excuse, neglect or refuse, when required by any such officer, to render him such assistance as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of his inspection. 9. In any case where a lodger in a lodging-house is entitled to the exclusive use of any court, courtyard, area, or other open space within the curtilage of the premises, the lodger, and in any case where two or more lodgers in a lodging-house are entitled to the use in common of any court, courtyard, area, or other open space within the curtilage of the premises, the keeper or where there is no keeper and the landlord resides on the premises the landlord shall, subject to the provisions of these bye-laws cause the court, courtyard, area, or other open space to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as is requisite for the purpose of keeping the same in a cleanly condition. 10. Subject to the provision of these bye-laws the landlord of a lodging-house shall cause every drain or means of drainage, with which any water-closet belonging to the lodging-house may communicate, to be maintained at all times in good order and efficient action. He shall also cause all such means of ventilation as are provided in or in connection therewith to be maintained at all times in good order. 11. Every lodger in a lodging-house shall cause all solid or liquid filth or refuse to be removed once at least in every day from every room which has been let to him, and shall once at least in every day cause every vessel, utensil, or other receptacle for such filth or refuse to be thoroughly cleansed. 12. In every case where a lodger in a lodging-house is entitled to the exclusive use of any staircase, landing, or passage in the lodging-house, the lodger shall cause every part of the staircase, landing, or passage to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as is requisite. 77 13 A lodger in a lodging-house shall not cause or suffer any animal to be kept in any room which has been let to the lodger or elsewhere upon the premises in such a manner as to render the condition of the room or premises filthy. 14. Subject to the provisions of these bye-laws the keeper, or where there is no keeper, and the landlord resides on the premises, the landlord of a lodging-house shall cause every common passage or staircase in the lodging-house to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as is requisite. 15. Subject to the provisions of these bye-laws the landlord of a lodging-house shall, at least once, and when required by the Council, at a specified date in every year, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed. He shall, at the same time, when it is necessary for thorough cleansing, cause the walls of every area, the surface of every ceiling, and the interior surface of every wall of every room, staircase, and passage in the lodging-house, and of every water closet belonging to the premises to< be thoroughly lime-washed. Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to lime-washing shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such ceiling or wall is painted, or where the material of or with which that surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where the said surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 16. Subject to the provisions of these bye-laws the landlord of a lodging-house shall provide adequate means of ventilation in or in connection with every common passage or staircase in the lodging-house, and shall cause the said means of ventilation to be maintained at all times in good order. 17. Subject to the provisions of these bye-laws the landlord of a lodging-house shall cause all such means of 78 ventilation as are provided in or in connection with any room in the lodging-house to be maintained at all times in good order. 18. In every case where, in pursuance of any statutory provision in that behalf, an order of a justice has been obtained for the removal from a lodging-house to a hospital of a person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disease and is without proper lodging or accommodation, the keeper, or where there is no keeper and the landlord resides on the premises, the landlord of the lodging-house, and the lodger to whom any room whereof the person aforesaid may be an occupant has been let shall, on being informed of the order, forthwith take all such steps as are requisite on the part of the keeper or landlord and of the lodger respectively, to secure the safe and prompt removal of the said person in compliance with the order, and shall, in and about the removal adopt all such precautions as, in accordance with any instructions which such keeper or landlord and such lodger, respectively, may receive from the Medical Officer of Health of the Council, are most suitable for the circumstances of the case. 19. Where a duty imposed upon or a prohibition applied to the keeper or landlord of a lodging-house as the case may be is by any bye-law expressly imposed or applied subject to the provisions of these bye-laws, proceedings shall not be taken against the keeper or landlord as the case may be for an offence against the bye-law unless and until the keeper or landlord, as the case may be, after service upon him of a notice in writing by the Council requiring him within such reasonable time as is specified in the notice to comply with the bye-law has failed to comply with the bye-law within the time so specified. Penalties. 20. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Council. 79 Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made, or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence, may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law. Repeal of Bye-Laws. 21. From and after the date of the confirmation of these bye-laws any bye-laws with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family in force in the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea shall be repealed. Hygienic Street Paving. In April, 1904, the Health Committee addressed a communication to the Highways Committee, asking that Committee to take into consideration the question of paving the carriage ways of certain side streets, particularly those in which diarrhoea had been prevalent in previous summers, with an impervious paving such as asphalt. The Highways Committee decided to give this form of paving a trial, and during that year the carriageways of the following fourteen streets were paved with tarred-slag macadam. This material gives a smooth impervious surface, and is much less expensive than asphalt. Austin Road Balfern Street Balham Park Road Britannia Place Elspeth Road Estcourt Road Gonsalva Road Kennard Street Latchmere Street Montholme Road Motley Street Mysore Road Northcote Road Parkside Street In 1905 further progress was made with the paving of street carriageways with impervious paving, and during the year the following twenty-one streets were paved with tarred-slag macadam. The total area paved was 33,134 square yards in extent. 80 Areas in Yards. Andoe Road 400 Barnard Road 1,320 Benham Street 947 Bridge Road West 4,832 Candahar Road 1,385 Doddington Grove 1,900 Falcon Grove 1,611 Granfield Street 1,378 Howie Street 960 Ingrave Street 4,568 Kerrison Road 1,116 Linda Street 1,207 Octavia Street 1,366 Southolm Street 1,134 Stockdale Road 2,259 Stoekwood Street 592 Theatre Street (part of) 450 Tritton Street 498 Usk Road 1,572 Wayland Road 1,119 Wix Lane 2,520 Total area of streets paved 33,134 All the above streets were paved in the early part of the year, for on 26th July, the Council decided to suspend any further use of this paving material for a period of twelve months, in order that its utility might be more severely tested. It is to be regretted that the development of this important work should have been postponed, for although differences of opinion existed as to the value of tarred-slag macadam as a paving in main streets there were none as to its value in side streets. The importance of impervious carriageway paving in urban sanitation cannot be too strongly emphasised, and it is to be hoped that the Council will see their way to make a much more extended use of this form of paving in the future. The advantages of impervious paving have already been discussed in previous annual reports, in connection with the prevention of infantile mortality. Sewer Ventilation. During the year, seventeen ventilating shafts were erected, eight of which were erected by the London County Council. Six of these ventilate the County Council's sewer in Battersea 81 Park Road, and two the sewer in York Road. The remaining nine were erected by the Borough Council to ventilate their sewers situated as follows:— Canterbury Place High Street Lavender Road Meyrick Road Patience Road Stockdale Road Shelgate Road Usk Road Wavford Street Most of these shafts were erected in consequence of complaints having been received of nuisance arising from sewer ventilators on the surface of the roadway. Usually the erection of the shaft abated the nuisance, but where this was not the case the surface ventilator was closed. Paving of Back-yards and Forecourts. The following table shows the number of back-yards and forecourts wholly or partly paved during 1905. Ward. Back-yards. Forecourts. Wholly paved. Partly paved. Wholly paved. Partly paved.

It should be said that no attempt was made to enforce the paving of any yard or forecourt which was being really cultivated as a garden. The yards and forecourts which were paved were merely pieces of waste land, usually in a dirty and untidy condition. The importance of the paving of the ground round dwelling-houses has been dealt with in previous annual reports in connection with the prevention of infantile mortality. It is one of those common-sense measures the value of which can be readily appreciated without any special knowledge. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected during the year was 3,308. In most cases the disinfectant used was formic aldehyde, either volatised in an Alformant lamp or applied in solution as "formalin" by means of a spray. In verminous rooms sulphur dioxide was used. In the case of every disease but measles, the process of disinfection included the removal of all bedding, clothing, and fabrics generally from the infected rooms, and the disinfection of these articles by steam in the Equifex machines at the Council's Disinfecting Station. Infected articles which would be destroyed by steam, such as boots, furs, &c., were disinfected by formic aldehyde in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. The following table shows the number of premises and rooms disinfected during each month of 1905. 83 Month. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria Enteric Fever. Erysipelas. Puerperal Fever. Phthisis. Measles.

The following articles were removed and destroyed at the request of the owners:— 85 Beds 34 Blankets 26 Bolsters 35 Carpets 21 Cushions 44 Mattresses 40 Palliasses 81 Pillows 53 Quilts 12 Sheets 24 Articles of wearing apparel 559 Total 929 Although the total number of articles disinfected was as high as 64,052, in no case was any well-founded complaint made of damage during disinfection, and no claim for compensation was made to the Council. This is valuable testimony to the care with which the work of disinfection was carried out by the Council's officers. During the past year the Council decided to increase the usefulness of the Disinfecting Station by erecting a small laundry on the disinfected or "clean" side of the building. Many dirty articles are removed for disinfection and when the laundry is provided, these articles will be washed and returned home cleansed as well as disinfected. Application has been made to the Local Government Board for a loan for the laundry, which, it is to be hoped, will be in working order before the end of the present year. The total weight of the articles removed and disinfected at the Disinfecting Station during the year 1905 was 151 tons 3cwt. 2qrs. The disinfection of this weight of articles at the charges made by the contractor formerly employed by the Council, viz., 15s. per cwt., would have cost the Council £2,267 12s. 6d. The actual cost is set out in detail below:– 86  £ s. d. Wages 676 0 0 Hire of Council's horses 200 15 0 Fuel 37 2 6 Water and electric light 2 17 0 Rates and taxes 64 3 5 Insurance 2 11 0 Stores and tradesmen's accounts 39 19 4 Interest on loan 93 4 1 Repairs 3 16 6 New steeping tank 12 10 0 Depreciation— Buildings (at 3 per cent.) 77 16 5 Machinery (at 10 per cent.) 63 12 0 Vans (at 10 per cent.) 12 18 0 Van shed (at 3 per cent.) 3 15 0 Total £1,091 0 3 By carrying out the work of disinfection without the intervention of a contractor this Council in the year 1905 saved the ratepayers £1,176 12s. 3d. Such a result is highly satisfactory and reflects credit upon Mr. Woodhouse, the Disinfection Superintendent. The amount saved in this way in each year since the opening of the Disinfecting Station in March, 1902, is stated below:— £ s. d. 1902 980 16 10 1903 540 0 5 1904 252 18 9 1905 1,176 12 3 Total £2,950 8 3 The result of the Council's action in carrying out the work of disinfection without the intervention of a contractor has been to effect a saving of £2,950 8s. 3d., a sum which is not 87 much below the cost of the station and the machines, which was £3,230. In addition to the work set out in the above tables, bedding belonging to the Council was on 262 occasions lent to homes from which bedding had been removed for disinfection. After use the Council's beds are collected, disinfected and returned to the store-room on the "clean" side of the station. The lending, collecting and disinfecting of this bedding throws a good deal of work on the staff which does not appear in the preceding tables. Temporary Shelter or House Accommodation. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (section 60, subsection 4) imposes an obligation upon Sanitary Authorities to provide accommodation for persons who have been compelled to leave their dwellings on account of disinfection being carried on therein. The Reception Shelter, which was ready for occupation in December, 1904, was occupied in 1905 by 33 persons whose homes were being disinfected after infectious disease. In the case of two families, food was supplied. One of the tenements of which the Shelter is composed was used for the personal disinfection of three midwives and three nurses who had been in attendance on cases of puerperal fever. In addition to these uses the Shelter might well be used to carry out the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, to which reference is made below. Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. In March, 1905, a circular letter was received from the London County Council enclosing a report by Dr. Wanklyn on the administration of the Cleansing of Persons Act in the Metropolitan Boroughs. The County Council suggested that the Borough Councils generally might avail themselves more fully of the provisions of the Act. On the instruction of the Health Committee I submitted the following report on the County Council's letter:— 88 I beg to submit a report on the letter of the London County Council, dated 27th March, 1905, On the Cleansing of persons Act, 1897. The County Council suggest that the Borough Councils might avail themselves more fully of the provisions of the Act. The object of the Act is therein stated to be "to permit Local Authorities to provide Cleansing and Disinfection for Persons infested with Vermin," and for this purpose the Act provides that "any Local Authority shall have the power, when in their discretion they shall see fit, to permit any person who shall apply to the said "Authority, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, to have the "use, free of charge, of the apparatus (if any) which the Authority "possess for cleansing the person and his clothing from vermin. "The use of such apparatus shall not be considered to be parochial "relief or charitable allowance to the person using the same, or to "the parent of such person, and no such person or parent shall by "reason thereof be deprived of any right or privilege, or be subject "to any disqualification or disability. Local Authorities may expend "any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants that "may be required for the carrying out of this Act, and any expenses "for these purposes may be defrayed out of any rate or fund "applicable by the Authority for general sanitary purposes, or for "the relief of the poor." The Act is not in any sense compulsory; a Local Authority is not under a statutory obligation to administer the Act nor, should the Authority decide to administer the Act, is there any power to compel any person to avail himself of its provisions. From Dr. Wanklyn's report, a copy of which is enclosed in the County Council's letter, it appears that comparatively few Sanitary Authorities in London have made any considerable use of the provisions of the Act. In some districts, however, much good work is being carried out. In Marylebone the Sanitary Authority began to administer the Act in March, 1898, and from that time to November, 1904, the number of persons cleansed was 32,500. In March 1905, the number of persons cleansed was no less than 916. In St. Pancras the Sanitary Authority made special provision for cleansing in May, 1904, and during the six months ending October, 1904, about 1,400 persons were cleansed, of whom 600 were women and children. In Hackney, where the Borough Council established a cleansing station in March, 1902, the number of persons cleansed is about 50 per annum. These are the only districts in London where a special cleansing station has been provided. In Westminster and Holborn cleansing is carried out in the Casual Wards, and in the following districts in the 89 Reception Shelter: Camberwell, Chelsea, Fulham, Greenwich, Hampstead, Islington, Lewisham. Poplar, Shoreditch, Southwark, Stoke Newington, Stepney and Wandsworth. In the following districts the administration of the Act has been left to the Boards of Guardians: Battersea, Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Deptford, Finsbury, Hammersmith, Lambeth, City of London, Kensington, Paddington and Woolwich. Dr. Wanklyn finds that no persons have been cleansed under the Act in Battersea, Bermondsey, Bethnal Green, Deptford, Hammersmith, Lambeth, Paddington and Woolwich. In the City of London the number of persons cleansed was about 20, in Kensington about 5, and in Finsbury 1 or 2. From the foregoing some idea may be formed as to the provisions of the Act and of the extent to which those provisions have been carried into effect in London. It now remains to consider whether it is advisable for the Council to administer the Act in this Borough. Since the last meeting of your Committee, I have visited the cleansing stations at Marylebone and St. Pancras and have enquired into the practical working of the Act, and I have no doubt that it affords a Sanitary Authority a means for doing valuable work. The Act is an important step in the right direction. The movement for sanitary reform has hitherto been directed to the attainment of civic cleanliness, that is to say, to the provision of better water supplies, improved systems of drainage and refuse removal, &c. At the present time, however, the reform movement is being extended to include questions of personal hygiene, and as the foundation of personal hygiene is personal cleanliness, an Act which has for its object the promotion of personal cleanliness should be welcomed by Sanitary Authorities. This Act affords the means whereby persons who, perhaps for no fault of their own, have become infested with vermin, may be cleansed without any stigma of pauperism, and to the great advantage of the community. I am informed that the Marylebone Cleansing Station has enabled men to secure work which was refused them while they were in a verminous condition. In St. Pancras a large number of school children have been cleansed, and in this way a cleansing station may be of great service. Battersea at the present time is in a position to carry out the provisions of the Act at small cost. The tenement of the Shelter opening into Sheepcote Lane could be used for the purpose. It would be advisable to paint on the door the words "Personal Cleansing 90 Station," and to connect the door with an electric bell ringing in the Disinfecting Station. I am informed by the Surveyor that the cost of this would be £5 4s., if the connections were made with lead covered wire, and £5 14s. if overhead phosphor wires carried on insulators were used. The present disinfecting staff could deal with the work at first, but if very many persons applied for disinfection, it would be necessary to engage an extra man. For cleansing women it would be necessary to employ a woman attendant, but at first it would be advisable to employ a temporary attendant per hour. It would be necessary to allow for the cost of towel washing, soap, and printing notices, &c. At first it is not likely that a very large number of persons would apply for cleansing, and the expenditure in the first year would probably be not more than about £50. If the Council decide to administer the Act it would be advisable to call attention to the fact that provision for cleansing and disinfection had been made, by exhibiting printed notices in common lodging houses, relief stations, dispensaries and other public places. The Health Committee, after considering the report, deferred any further action until the early part of 1906, so that the necessary expenses involved in carrying out the provisions of the Act might be included in the annual estimates. Midwives' Act, 1902. This important Act is administered in London by the London County Council, who are the local supervising authority, but duties of considerable importance, relating to the disinfection of midwives who> have been attending patients suffering from puerperal fever or other infectious diseases, devolve upon the Borough Councils, who are the local Sanitary Authorities. Rule 5 of the rules framed by the Central Midwives' Board provides as follows 5. Whenever a midwife has been in attendance upon a patient suffering from puerperal fever, or from any other illness supposed to be infectious, she must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances to the satisfaction of the local Sanitary Authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. Unless otherwise directed by the local supervising 91 authority, all washable clothing should be boiled, and other clothing should be sent to be stoved (by the local Sanitary Authority), and then exposed freely to the open air for several days. One of the three tenements in the Shelter is used for the disinfection of midwives and monthly nurses, who have been in attendance on patients suffering from puerperal fever, or other infectious disease. The infected person has a disinfectant bath, while her clothing, bag, instruments, &c., are disinfected at the Disinfecting Station, which is only a few yards distant from the Shelter. Mortuary. The number of bodies removed to the Mortuary in Sheepcote Lane was 253. Two hundred and thirty-six were inquest cases, and 16 bodies removed for sanitary reasons from crowded homes. The following table gives the number of bodies removed to the Mortuary in each year since 1892:— Year. Number of bodies received in the Mortuary. Number of bodies upon which postmortem examinations were held. Number of bodies upon which Coroner's inquests were held. 1892 193 163 187 1893 243 200 237 1894 224 197 208 1895 259 210 232 1896 293 242 278 1897 289 246 273 1898 294 238 267 1899 274 221 260 1900 291 234 273 1901 321 271 304 1902 239 198 224 1903 223 207 213 1904 221 l6l 204 1905 253 176 236 92 The largest number of bodies received during any one day of the year was on the 20th November, when six bodies were admitted. Inquests were held in 236 cases, and verdicts were returned as follows:— Natural Causes ... 129 Open Verdict— Found dead 4 Found drowned 8 - 12 Accidental— Falls, &c. 34 Suffocation in bed with parents 7 Suffocation otherwise 6 Burns and scalds 7 Poisoning 3 Run over in streets and on railway 6 Drowning 4 Other injuries, &c. 7 - 74 Suicide— Cut throat 6 Drowning 2 Poisoning 7 On railway 1 Shooting 2 Severed artery 1 — 19 Homicide— Suffocation ... 2 Total ... 236 Ambulances. The Council has for some years provided a wheeled handambulance at each of the chalets in Battersea Park Road, Queen's Road (2), York Road and Lavender Hill, and one is stationed at the corner of Nightingale Lane and Bolingbroke 93 Grove, there being six ambulances in all. The ambulances are freely accessible to the public, and each is provided with splints and surgical dressings. The ambulances are not infrequently used, particularly by the police, to convey injured persons to hospital, and they are undoubtedly of considerable service to the district. Block Dwellings. The following is a list of the artizans' dwellings of the "block" type in Battersea with the number of tenements in each:— Name of Buildings. Situation. Owner No. of tenements. Battersea Bridge Buildings Bridge Road London County Council 69 Durham Buildings York Road ” 108 Victoria Dwellings Battersea Park Road Victoria Dwellings Asso., Ltd. 189 Lombard Dwellings Lombard Road Exors. of Francis Ravenscroft 36 Shaftesbury Chambers Ashbury Road Artizans, &c., Dwellings Co. 22 During the last eighteen months, as a result of a personal inspection by the Medical Officer of Health, extensive structural improvements have been carried out in the Victoria Dwellings in Battersea Park Road. The chief features of these alterations are as follows:— 775 feet of drainage has been re-constructed, and 15 access chambers provided. 79 water closets with 20 soil pipes and ventilation pipes have been provided in place of old and defective apparatus. 189 new glazed stoneware sinks have been provided, each sink being fixed with a 2-inch 94 galvanized iron trap connected to a 2-inch pipe discharging into a gully in the open air. Two large drying yards, one 873 square yards, the other 213 square yards in area have been paved, and 64 square yards of forecourt have also been paved. The covers of 20 drinking water cisterns have been repaired. 139 rooms have been cleansed, the staircases have been cleansed, repaired, and more freely ventilated, and 7 cases of over-crowding have been dealt with. Six large and 189 small dust receptacles have been provided in place of 16 dust shoots which have been cleansed, lime-whited, filled up and the openings sealed with brickwork or concrete. It should be said that these alterations, involving the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, were readily carried out by the Victoria Dwellings Association, who appeared to be anxious to do whatever was necessary to improve the sanitary condition of the dwellings. One of the most important of the improvements effected was the abolition of the dust shoots. Dust collection, at its best, is not one of the most satisfactory features of London sanitation ; but of all the defective systems now in use the most unsatisfactory is that of casting the refuse down a dark and evil-smelling shaft, which forms part of the dwelling, into a still more repellent hole below. Yet this system is far from uncommon. Each tenement in the Victoria Dwellings is now provided with a small dust receptacle, the contents of which are emptied every day into a larger receptacle in the courtyard, and the contents of the latter receptacle are removed by the Council three times a week. 95 Van Dwellings. There were 65 dwellings of this description in Battersea in 1905, situated as follows. The corresponding figures in 1904 was 78. Situation of Vans. No. of Vans. No. of Occupants. Males. Females.

Twenty-two vans were found to be overcrowded, and various structural defects in the vans or in the yards in which they stand were remedied. In the new bye-laws relating to tents and vans, which were confirmed by the Local Government Board in 1904, powers were given to the Council to secure the better paving of the yards, which are now all paved with impervious material. Common Lodging Mouses. The following is a list of the common lodging houses in Battersea:— 96 Premises. Authorised number of Lodgers. Whether Males or Females.

Smoke Nuisance. Emission of black smoke was reported on 45 occasions. Thirty-nine reports were made by the Council's inspectors, and 6 by the Coal Smoke Abatement Society. Forty-two intimations and 12 statutory notices were served, and 4 summonses were taken out. As a result of the proceedings arising out of these summonses, penalties amounting with costs to £5 8s. were imposed. Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. The following is a list of certificates for exemption from inhabited house duty granted by the Medical Officer of Health in each year since 1890:— 97 Year. No. of Certificates Granted. Year. No. of Certificates Granted. 1890 243 1898 82 1891 113 1899 68 1892 165 1900 93 1893 201 1901 32 1894 91 1902 28 1895 91 1903 97 1896 120 1904 232 1897 27 1905 61 The number of tenements inspected by the Medical Officer of Health during 1905 was 67, 36 of which were erected by the Council in Town Hall Road and Theatre Street. Of the remaining 31 cases, the certificate was refused in 6 instances, and in the remainder it was granted after structural alterations had been carried out to improve the sanitary condition of the dwellings. Stables. There are 576 stables in Battersea, which afford accommodation for over 3,000 horses. The stables are kept under systematic supervision by the district sanitary inspectors and efforts are made to secure a frequent removal of the manure. The ordinary nuisance sections of the Public Health Act were found to be inadequate to deal effectively with the serious form of nuisance arising from the accumulation of manure in stables, and in the spring of last year the Health Committee recommended the Council to exercise the fuller powers conferred upon Sanitary Authorities by section 36, sub-section 2 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The sub-section is in these terms:— Notice may be given by a Sanitary Authority (by public announcement in the district or otherwise) requiring the periodical removal of manure or other refuse matter from stables, cowhouses, or other premises; and where any such notice has been given, if any person to whom the manure or other refuse matter belongs fails to comply with the notice, he shall be liable without 98 further notice to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings for each day during which such non-compliance continues. Accordingly on 7th June, 1905, the Council on the recommendation of the Health Committee passed the following resolution:— That the Council do hereby order and direct that all manure or other refuse matter shall be removed daily from stables, cowhouses and similar premises in the Borough and that notice of this requirement be published throughout the Borough and be served on such persons as the Health Committee may from time to time direct. In order to make the Council's resolution widely known, the following placard was published throughout the Borough:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF BATTERSEA. Removal of Manure. The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, being the Sanitary Authority for the district, hereby give notice that they require that all manure or other similar refuse matter shall be removed daily from stables, cowhouses, and similar premises in the Borough. Any person to whom such manure or refuse belongs who fails to comply with this requirement will be liable under section 36 (2) of the Public Plealth (London) Act, 1891, without further notice, to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings, for each day during which such non-compliance continues. By Order of the Council, W. Marcus Wilkins, Town Clerk. Town Hall, Battersea. 7th June, 1905. 99 It was not intended, however, that a daily removal of manure should be required from all the stables in the borough irrespective of the number of horses kept. It was thought desirable at first to send the notice mentioned in the Council's resolution only in those cases where more than 20 horses were stabled in one place. In such cases the following notice was sent:— PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. Removal of Manure. The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, being the Sanitary Authority for the district, hereby give notice that they require the daily removal of manure from the stable occupied by you, and situate at in the said Borough. If you fail to comply with this notice, you will be liable under section 36 (2) of the above-mentioned Act, without further notice, to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings for each day during which such non-compliance continues. G. F. McCleary, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. The result of this procedure has been beneficial. A more frequent removal of manure has been secured, but it cannot be said that the nuisance has been wholly abated. In large stables even a daily removal is insufficient, and the occupiers of the smaller stables complain that in summer they find it impracticable to secure a daily removal. There is no doubt that this is a real difficulty, and it is not too much to say that the only effective way to get rid of the nuisance arising from the deposit of horse manure in large towns is to get rid of the horse, and fortunately there are signs that this much-needed sanitary reform is being somewhat rapidly effected. As an indication of the progress which is being made in this direction, it may be noted that a large stable in Battersea, which a few months ago accommodated some hundreds of horses is now being cleansed and reconstructed as a garage for motor omnibuses. The electrification of the tramways in Nine Elms Lane, Battersea Park Road, York Road and Falcon Road, which is now 100 proceeding will, when completed, materially lessen the nuisance and serious danger to health arising from the deposit of vast amounts of filth, in the form of animal excreta, in our streets. Water Supply. At the beginning of the year 1904, the Water Supply of Battersea was derived from the Lambeth and the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Companies, the latter supplying the whole of the Borough except the southern part of the South-Western sub-district. In June, 1904, the property of these Companies was transferred to the Metropolitan Water Board, who are now responsible for the Water Supply of Battersea, except the houses on the Latchmere Estate, which are supplied with water from the wells sunk by the Council in the vicinity. During the year monthly samples from the rising mains were taken in the areas formerly supplied by the two Water Companies, and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. The houses, from the mains of which the samples were taken are given in the following table:— Date taken. Metropolitan Water Board. Lambeth District. Southwark and Vauxhall District. Jan. 24 111 St. James' Road 33 Britannia Place Feb. 21 67 Honeywell Road 1 Broughton Street Mar. 29 19 Darley Road 80 Latchmere Road Apr. 19 9 Ballingdon Road 20 Mantua Street May 24 115 St. James' Road 10 Taybridge Road June 22 42 Chatham Road 71 Latchmere Road July 26 11 Ballingdon Road 12 Knowsley Road Aug. 28 36 Broomwood Road 31 Latchmere Street Sept. 18 19 Chatto Road 53 Winstanley Road Oct. 26 10 Bellevue Road 95 Latchmere Road Nov. 28 12 Dents Road 105 Latchmere Road Dec. 14 17 Chatto Road Manley's Yard, 94 Falcon Road 101 According to the reports of the Public Analyst, the above samples consisted of waters which he regarded as being of "fair," "tolerably fair," or, in the case of the two samples taken in February, "very fair" quality. The Council's dwellings on the Latchmere Estate are supplied with water from deep wells sunk near the Latchmere Baths. The water from these wells was analysed on nine occasions during the year, and found to be of a high degree of purity. Slaughter-houses. Under the London Government Act, 1899, the duty of inspecting slaughter-houses, cow-houses and milk-shops was transferred from the London County Council to the Borough Councils. The slaughter-houses are frequently inspected by the Food Inspector. They are generally kept in a clean condition, and very little slaughtering is done therein, most of the meat being imported from outside Battersea. The following is a list of the premises licensed as slaughter-houses:— 205 St. John's Hill. 345 Battersea Park Road. 351 York Road. 235 Battersea Park Road. 49 York Road. 96 Falcon Road. The number of slaughter-houses in Battersea is now 6, as against 9 in 1901. An application for the renewal of the licence formerly granted in respect to the slaughter-house at 163 St. John's Hill was successfully opposed by the Council at the licensing meeting of the London County Council. Cow-houses. A list of the cow-houses in the Borough is given below:— 14 Belle Vue Road. 122 Usk Road. 17 Wiseton Road. The total number of cows kept in these cowsheds is ten. The premises are kept in a clean condition, and after they had been visited by a sub-committee of the Health Committee, it was decided not to oppose the renewal of any of the licences. 102 Milk Shops. In 1905 the milk-shops were kept under systematic supervision by Inspector Benjamin. The number of milk-shops on the register at the end of 1904 was 246; during 1905, 48 new milk-shops were added, and the use of 40 discontinued, the total number at the end of 1905 being 254. In 154 instances milk was sold in general shops; in 76, in shops where only dairy produce was sold; in 14, in confectioners' shops, and in 9 cases milk was found to be sold from a dwelling"-house and in one case from a coffee shop. Only 16 milk sellers in Battersea obtain milk direct from the farmer; 136 are supplied by wholesale dealers, 91 by other retail purveyors of milk in Battersea, and 11 from retail dealers outside Battersea. In 108 instances less than one gallon of milk is sold daily, in 57 shops between one and ten gallons are sold daily per shop, and in 89 shops the daily quantity of milk sold per shop is over ten gallons. Forty-three intimations were served for offences under the Public Health Act discovered in milk-shops, and 16 special letters were sent out, calling upon defaulting purveyors of milk to comply with the Milk Regulations of the London County Council. Particulars as to the prevalence of milk adulteration in Battersea are given in the section of this report dealing with the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Legal proceedings were taken in respect to 69 adulterated samples, and the results of the prosecutions are set out on pages 138-151. One milk-seller was prosecuted, under the Milk Regulations, for storing milk in a stable, and was fined £I and costs. Unsound Food. Two seizures of unsound food, one of unsound fish, the other of unsound strawberries, were made during the year. Legal proceedings were taken in both cases, and the defendants convicted and fined. In cases where the retail vendor has unknowingly purchased articles of food unfit for human consumption, and has made no attempt to sell the articles, it is the practice, when the latter are brought to the Health Office, to grant a 103 certificate, which enables the retailer to claim the return of the money paid for the articles to the wholesale dealer. The food is destroyed at the Council's destructor. During the year certificates were granted in respect to the following articles of food, all of which were first covered with disinfectant and then taken to the destructor and destroyed. Food.

These premises were closely supervised during the year. There are 67 premises in Battersea where fish is sold. In 47 of these places fried fish only is sold, in 16, wet and dried fish only is sold, and 4 shops sell wet, dried and fried fish. 104 Forty notices were served to remedy insanitary conditions discovered in fish shops. In 3 shops a water-closet was found within the place where the fish was stored. Ice Cream. During the year ice-cream was sold on 110 premises in Battersea, the number in 1904 being 116. These premises were supervised by Inspector Benjamin. Various offences against the Public Health Act were discovered, and in eight instances there was failure to comply with the provisions relating to ice-cream in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. In two cases it was necessary to take legal proceedings against ice-cream vendors who persisted in making ice-cream in a living room. In one of the cases the ice-cream was being made while a patient suffering from a mild and unrecognised form of scarlet fever was in the same room. Both defendants were convicted. Butchers' Shops. There are 95 butchers' shops in Battersea, all of which are under the supervision of Inspector Chuter. On 59 of these premises sausage-making or meat-chopping is carried on, the work being done by hand in 44 cases, and by machinery in 15 cases. Eighty-eight of the shops are provided with ice-safes. The trade refuse is removed as follows:— Winter. Summer. Once a week 10 4 Twice a week 75 57 Three times a week 6 29 Four times a week — 1 Daily 4 4 The premises generally are kept in a cleanly and, on the whole, satisfactory condition. 105 Sale of Food and Drug's Acts. The following table shows the number of samples taken under the above Acts during 1905, and the number found to be genuine, adulterated, or inferior. Description of Article. Total No. of Samples taken. Genuine. Adulterated. Inferior. Arrowroot 3 3 ... ... Brandy 2 2 ... ... Bread & Butter 6 3 3 ... Butter 126 105 10 11 Camphorated Oil 5 5 ... ... Coffee 16 13 3 ...

Totals 700 593 90 17 The adulterated samples formed 12.86 per cent. of the whole number of samples taken. This is a lower percentage of adulterated samples than that obtained in 1904 or in 1903, but it is higher than the corresponding figure in any of the five preceding years, notwithstanding the increased number of samples taken. This is shown below:— 106 Year. No. of Samples taken. No. of Adulterated Samples. Percentage of Adulterated Samples. 1898 357 44 12.32 1899 506 56 11.06 1900 514 46 8.92 1901 474 35 7.38 1902 500 52 10.40 1903 500 67 13.40 1904 700 107 15.28 1905 700 90 12.86 The proportion of adulterated samples obtained is not, however, except within wide limits, necessarily a trustworthy indication of the extent to which adulteration is prevalent. Much depends on the methods employed in taking the samples. It is generally found that where a special inspector is appointed for this work a higher proportion of adulterated samples is obtained than is the case where the samples are procured by inspectors who are chiefly occupied with other duties. The whole of the samples in 1904 and 1905 were taken by Mr. Chuter, the Food Inspector, and those in 1903 by Inspectors Chuter and Herrin, who, although at that time district sanitary inspectors, were specially selected for food and drugs work, and devoted much time and care to that work. In previous years the samples were taken by all the district inspectors in rotation. 514 samples of milk were taken, 452 being taken on weekdays and 62 on Sundays. Of the 452 week-day samples, 58, or 12.83 per cent., were adulterated, while out of the 62 samples taken on Sundays no less than 16, or 25.8 per cent. were adulterated. That is to say the percentage of adulterated samples was twice as high on Sundays as on week-days. This 107 is similar to the results obtained in other districts, and it emphasises the importance of frequent Sunday sampling. On reference to the table of prosecutions on page 138, it will be seen that proceedings were taken in 9 cases of milk adulteration with chemical preservatives, the preservative employed being in 8 samples boracic acid, and in one sample formaldehyde. Four of the former cases deserve special mention. In these cases a firm of milk-sellers was summoned for selling milk to which boracic acid had been added in quantities varying from 1.3977 to 1.717 grains per pint. Evidence on behalf of the Council was given by Professor Kenwood, who stated that these quantities were, especially under certain conditions, dangerous to health, and further, that if milk were produced in a cleanly manner there was no need to add chemical preservatives of any kind, even in the hottest weather. The defendants were fined £2 and £10 10s. costs in respect of the first sample and ordered to pay the costs of the summonses in respect of the three remaining samples. These cases are worthy of mention, for, so far as I am aware, there is no other case on record of a conviction having been obtained for the addition of so small a quantity of boracic acid to milk. It is evident that the existing law may be successfully invoked in cases where boracic acid has been added to milk, even in so small a proportion as 1.3977 grains per pint. Unfortunately, however, magistrates cannot always be relied upon to take so serious a view of the presence of boracic acid in milk, and it is much to be hoped that there will be no further delay in giving legislative effect to the following recommendation of the Departmental Committee on Food Preservatives:— "That the use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in milk offered for sale in the United Kingdom be constituted an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts." 108 It cannot be said that the number of samples taken in Battersea, viz., 700 yearly, is at all adequate to the needs of the district. There are registered in the Borough no less than 254 milk-sellers, and a large amount of milk is sold in the Borough by vendors who live in, and are registered in, other districts. Each of these traders should be sampled at least twice a year, and some of them much more frequently. Considerably more than 700 samples of milk should be taken yearly, and the total number of samples taken should be at least 1,000. From the beginning of the present year the Public Analyst has arranged to supply the Medical Officer of Health with returns, showing the percentage proportion of fat and of non-fatty solids in every sample of milk submitted to him for analysis, whether the sample be found to be adulterated or genuine. This information will be of the greatest value in the administration of the Food and Drugs Acts, as, amongst other advantages, it will indicate the traders whose milk calls for more frequent analysis. Town Hall Mousing Estate. The Council's Housing Estate at the rear of the Town Hall, was opened by the Mayor (Councillor W. J. West, J.P.) on March 11th, and the dwellings were all occupied shortly after that date. There are 18 houses on the estate, 14 of which contain two three-room tenements each, and the remaining 4 two two-room tenements each. The total number of dwellings is 36, and the number of rooms 100. The height of each living room and of each bedroom is 8 feet 9 inches. In the threeroom tenements the air space varies in the living rooms from 1,234 to 1,350 cubic feet, and in the bedrooms from 1,027 to 1,377 cubic feet; in the two-room tenements the air space varies in the living rooms from 1,283 to 1,535 cubic feet, and in the bedrooms from 918 to 984 cubic feet. Each tenement is selfcontained, having its own front door opening on the street, is wired for electric light, and is provided with a ventilated larder, a dresser, blinds, and the Cornes combined kitchen-range, copper and bath. There are picture rails in all the rooms, each 109 room has a hanging wardrobe, and hat and coat rails are provided in the passages. The upper tenements are provided with teak stair cases, giving access to the back gardens. The buildings were erected by the Council's Works Department, under the supervision of the Borough Surveyor, and, with the exception of the Council's dwellings on the Latchmere Estate, which they closely resemble, they are in design, construction and equipment, the best workmen's dwellings I have yet seen. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. 113 Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. The following part of this report is made pursuant to section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, which provides as follows:—"The Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall in his Annual Report to them report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his Annual Report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State." The report, however, is not limited to an account of the administration of the above Act in workshops and workplaces; it contains in addition a statement of the work done by the Council in carrying out their duties in relation to factories under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Workshops. The workshops in Battersea are supervised by the two Workshop Inspectors, Miss Dawson and Mr. Benjamin. Workshops in which women only are employed are inspected by Miss Dawson. Mr. Benjamin has charge of the men's workshops, while those in which both sexes are employed are supervised by both Inspectors. Pursuant to section 131 of the Factory Act, a register of workshops is kept, and it has been found that the card register, which has now been in use nearly four years, has many advantages over the ordinary book register. Each workshop has a special dossier, in which are filed all the reports, plans, letters, and other papers relating to that particular workshop. At the beginning of the year 1905, there were 493 workshops on the register. During the year the occupation of 70 of these premises as workshops was discontinued, while 138 new workshops were registered, so that at the end of the year the number on the register was 561, in which were employed 2,477 persons: 1,039 males and 1,438 females. 114 The following is a list of the workshops on the register at the end of 1905:— WORKSHOPS.

This section is important, as it provides the procedure by which most workshops become known to the factory inspectors, who, upon receiving the notice, enter the workshop in the Home Office register and send an abstract of the Act to the occupier.

Bakehouses. There are 86 workshop bakehouses and 6 factory bakehouses in Battersea. The former are supervised by the Council's Inspectors, the latter mainly by the Factory Inspectors. The factory bakehouses are all above ground, while of the workshop bakehouses, 54 are above ground and 32 underground, according to the definition given in the Factory Act. When the Factory Act of 1901 was passed, there were 49 underground bakehouses in Battersea; 16 of these have been closed, and the remaining 33 greatly improved and certified as suitable by the Sanitary Authority. One of the underground bakehouses was left unoccupied during 1905, making the total number of underground bakehouses in use at the end of the year 32. In 9 of the 16 cases in which the use of the bakehouse was discontinued the occupier removed to a newly-built bakehouse in or near the same premises.

In many of the premises above ground, improvements were made on the lines of the alterations carried out in the underground bakehouses. The following is a tabulated statement of the work carried out in connection with workshop inspection during the year, so far as it admits of tabulation:— Workshop inspections and re-inspections 4,412 Workrooms measured 208 Workshops notified to H.M. Inspector 54 Cards distributed showing number of persons legally employed in workrooms 117 Written intimations issued 196 Statutory notices served 52 119 Defects discovered in Workshops and remedied:— Workrooms in a dirty condition 139 ,, overcrowded 2 ,, badly ventilated 6 ,, with defective walls or ceilings 14 ,, with defective floors 8 Workshops with defective yard paving 13 ,, with defective drains 7 ,, with blocked drains 12 ,, without proper dustbins 8 ,, with defective w.c. apparatus 30 ,, with sanitary conveniences insufficient in number or absent 6 ,, with sanitary conveniences opening into workrooms 3 ,, with sanitary conveniences without proper doors or fastenings 5 ,, with sanitary conveniences in dirty condition 16 Coal bins provided in bakehouses 4 Accumulations of refuse removed 22 Other defects remedied 18 The following notices of defects were received from H.M. Inspectors of Factories. In each case a notice was served on the person responsible, and the defects remedied. Premises. Trade. Nature of Complaint. London and Provincial Steam Laundry, Battersea Park Road Laundry Sanitary convenience insufficiently ventilated, and not properly divided off from mess-room. Insufficient number of sanitary conveniences for females employed. 80 Falcon Road Tailor No w.c. accommodation. 120 Workplaces. Although the term "workplace" occurs in both the Factory Act and the Public Health (London) Act, in neither Act is it defined; but in the case of Bennett v. Harding, under section 38 of the latter Act, it was held that the term "workplace" includes any "place where work is done permanently and where people assemble together to do work permanently of some kind or other." In this case a stable and stable-yard where men were employed as cab-cleaners and horse-keepers, was held to be a workplace. The Home Secretary has been advised that kitchens of restaurants, &c., are workplaces. The restaurant and coffee-house kitchens in Battersea were first brought under systematic sanitary supervision in 1902, when a thorough inspection was made by Inspector Benjamin. In that year the kitchens were 83 in number. The total number on the register at the end of 1904 was 92, and during 1905 2 new kitchens were opened and the use of 7 discontinued, making a total at the end of 1905 of 87. At the beginning of 1905 7 of these kitchens were underground, but during the year 1 underground kitchen was closed and the work done in a kitchen on the ground level in the same building. At the present time there are, therefore, 6 underground kitchens in Battersea. The sanitary condition of the kitchens has been much improved since they have been brought under systematic supervision, but, as mentioned in previous annual reports, there is much need of bye-laws to regulate the structural condition of the premises, the way in which they are kept, and the way in which the food is stored and prepared. A list of the kitchens is given on the following page. 121 Restaurant and Coffee-House Kitchens. Premises.

The Factory Act of 1901 provides that in certain trades to be specified by the Home Secretary, the employers shall twice a year send to the Sanitary Authority lists of the outworkers employed by them. The trades so far specified by the Home Secretary are as follows:— The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto; The making, ornamenting and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets; Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work; The making of electro-plate; The making of files; Fur-pulling; The making of iron and steel cables and chains; The making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels; 123 The making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gear buckles, mullin bits, hooks, and attachments of all kinds; The making of locks, latches and keys. The making of covers for, and the covering, finishing, altering or repairing of, umbrellas, sunshades, parasols, and articles of a similar character, and any work incidental thereto; The making of paper bags and of paper boxes; Brush making, and The making of stuffed toys. The last four trades were added by an Order of the Home Secretary, dated 15th August, 1905. The names and addresses of 469 out-workers were received during the year. Lists were sent in by employers and by the Medical Officers of Health of the following Metropolitan Boroughs:— Borough. No. of Lists. Borough. No. of Lists. Camberwell 1 Paddington 1 Chelsea 2 St. Marylebone 1 City of London 9 Southwark 2 Finsbury 10 Wandsworth 10 Hackney 1 Westminster 6 Kensington 6 Sixty-four out-workers whose names were sent in by employers were found to live outside Battersea, and their names and addresses were sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the respective districts. 124 The premises occupied by the out-workers are registered and regularly inspected, and any insanitary condition found remedied. The premises generally are in a very fair condition, and comparatively few notices are required. The following table shows the number of such places which have been registered, together with the trades and the number of persons employed. No children were found to be employed on these premises and only one young person. Trade Number on Register. Persons Employed. Premises Rooms Males. Females.

The Factory Act contains a special sanitary code for factories, which is administered by the Factory Inspectors; but for the most part this code supplements, not displaces, the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, which are administered by the Sanitary Authorities. The definition of the word "house" in the latter Act includes a factory, and where there is no express statutory provision to the contrary, the sections of that Act apply to factories as to dwelling houses. Moreover, section 38 of the Public Health Act lays upon the Sanitary Authorities the duty of securing for the workers "sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences " in all factories. 126 The following is a list of the factories in Battersea:— Trade.

The Infants Milk Depot is situated at 28 York Road, and from this central depot where the preparation and bottling of the milk takes place, the milk is conveyed to two additional distributing depots, one at the Health Office in the Municipal Buildings, and the other at the Public Library in Lurline Gardens. There are thus three places in the Borough where the milk may be obtained. The total number of children fed from the dep6t during the year 1905 was 709. Of these, 681 were resident in Battersea, and the remaining 28 in the neighbouring Boroughs of Wandsworth, Lambeth and Chelsea. Of the 709 children fed during 1905, 207 were already on the books of the depot at the beginning of the year, so that the number of children who began to be fed during the year was 502. The ages of the children when admitted to the dep6t were as follows:— Under 1 week. Over 1 week and under 1 month. Over 1 month and under 3 months. Over 3 months and under 6 months. Over 6 months and under 9 months. Over 9 months and under 12 months. Over 12 months. 41 96 282 177 68 21 24 The length of time during which these children were fed from the depôt up to December 31st, 1905, is given below. It should be said, however, that a considerable number of the children were still taking the milk at the beginning of 1906, and as some of these began late in 1905, the following table understates the usual periods during which children continue to be fed from the depôt. 156 Under 1 week. Over 1 week and under 1 month. Over 1 month and under 3 months. Over 3 months and under 6 months. Over 6 months and under 9 months. Over 9 months and under 12 months. Over 12 months. 45 108 153 184 99 78 42 364 children came to the depot with recommendations from medical practitioners, and 346 were more or less seriously ill when they began to be fed on the milk. The total number of deaths was 75, and the death-rate 105.7 per 1,000. Fourteen deaths occurred amongst children who had taken the milk for less than one week, the children being already most seriously ill when they began to be fed from the depot. The dep6t children must not be regarded as a normal infant population. They form a population of hand-fed babies, nearly 50 per cent. of whom are brought to the dep6t on account of ill-health. It is sometimes made a reproach against milk depots that they discourage breast-feeding, and it is important that a milk depot should be so conducted as to avoid the danger that the milk may be used as a substitute for mother's milk by mothers who are well able to suckle their babies, but who, for some reason or other, refuse to do so. Under the present arrangements no child is admitted to the Battersea depot unless the mother can satisfy the Medical Officer of Health, by the production of a written recommendation of a medical practitioner, or otherwise, that it is impossible or inadvisable for her to suckle her infant. If she is able to feed the baby at the breast partially, but not wholly, she is encouraged to do so, and special arrangements are made for the supply of a proper quantity of the milk in such cases. 157 Each applicant for the milk must fill in the followingform:— BATTERSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department. Application for Infants' Milk. Name of Child Address Date of Birth Recommended by Dr. Signature of Applicant Date of Application Signature of Medical Officer of Health Date When a child is first entered at the depôt the following card of instructions is handed to the mother, and the instructions are at the same time carefully explained to her. 158 BATTERSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL. Infants' Milk Depot, 28 York Road. 1. The Infants' Milk supplied by the Battersea Borough Council is intended for those infants whose mothers are not able to suckle them. The milk will not be supplied to any mother who is able to suckle her baby, but who refuses to do so. Mothers should make every effort to suckle their babies for at least nine months from birth. No artificial food can be anything but a poor substitute for mother's milk. If a mother cannot feed her baby wholly at the breast she should give the baby as much of her own milk as possible and supplement with cow's milk; special arrangements will be made for a supply of the Infants' Milk in such cases. 2. The charges for a full supply of the milk are as follows For children under six months old, is. 6d. per week, or 3d. per day. For children from six to twelve months old, 2s. per week, or 4d. per day. For children over twelve months old, 2s. 6d. per week, or 5d. per day. For children living outside Battersea an extra charge of gd. per week will be made. All payments must be made in advance. 3. The Depot is open from 12 to 6 p.m. on weekdays, and is closed on Sundays. 4. The milk will be supplied in bottles in a basket, each basket containing a supply of milk for twenty-four hours, and each bottle containing sufficient milk for one meal and for no more than one meal. Infants under 2 months receive nine bottles per day ; older children receive fewer bottles, as they should be fed less frequently. 5. If children are sent for the milk, they must be warned not to tamper with the stoppers of the bottles, and on no account to open the bottles. 6. Keep the milk in a cool place. 7. It is most important that the baby should be fed regularly. The milk should be given at the following intervals. 159 For a baby under 2 months old: Give the milk every two hours in the day and every four hours at night. For a baby between 2 and 3 months old: Give the milk every two and a half hours in the day and once at night. For a baby between 3 and 6 months old: Give the milk every three hours in the day and once at night. When the baby is 6 months old the interval between each meal should be gradually lengthened, and the baby may sleep seven or eight hours at night without a meal. 8. On no account should the bottle be opened until the baby is ready to be fed. When feeding time arrives place the bottle unopened in a basin of hot water for about five minutes. Then open the bottle and put on the teat. The baby should be fed from the Depot bottle. No other feeding bottle may be used. 9. When all the milk in one bottle is not used, the remainder may be given to the other children, but it must not be warmed up again for the baby. Take a fresh bottle for the baby's next meal. 10. No other food should be given unless ordered by a doctor. 11. Immediately after use the bottle should be well rinsed in clean water, and the teat should be turned inside out, held under the tap and cleansed, and should then be kept in clean water until it is used for the next meal. 12. Breakages will be charged for at the rate of 1d. per bottle, and damage to baskets must be made good. All bottles, baskets, and rubber rings not returned to the Depot will be charged full value. 13. It is important that the child should be brought once a week to be weighed. A room at the Latchmere Baths is open for this purpose on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 5 p.m. (entrance in Latchmere Road). 14. The presence of Infectious Disease in a house must be notified at once to the Medical Officer of Health. 15. The milk is supplied on the condition that it will be used in accordance with the directions given above. Should the milk be deliberately misused the supply will be stopped. 160 The homes of the children are visited within a day or two after the child has begun to take the milk, by Mrs. Young, one of the Lady Sanitary Inspectors, who endeavours to secure a proper use of the milk. Difficulties are not infrequently met with in this work. Some mothers deliberately pour the milk from the depot bottles into the deadly bottle with the long rubber tube, from which they then feed the baby, and one mother was found to make a daily practice of pouring the contents of all the nine bottles into a jug, and then feeding the baby from a longtube bottle. Her excuse was that she had always been accustomed to store her milk in a jug, and that she did not see why at her time of life she should make any change in her methods of housekeeping. In cases where the milk has been found to have been deliberately misused the supply has been stopped. During the summer of 1905 improvements were effected in the arrangements for weighing the babies. By the kindness of the Baths Committee, a comfortable room at the Latchmere Baths has been set aside for this purpose from 3 to 5 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. The babies are weighed under the personal supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, who effects such modifications in the milk as appear necessary to suit individual cases. A record of each child is kept, and on the following page is a reproduction of a specimen page of the case register. 161 Name Address Date of birth of admission of first visit.
