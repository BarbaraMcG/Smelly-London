To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith, in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1910. The mortality statistics for the year arc again of a very satisfactory character. The Birth Rate of 21.41 per 1,000 is slightly below that of the County of London, which figure was 23.9 per 1,000. The recorded Death Rate of 11.45 per 1,000 of the estimated population, compares favourably with 12.7 per 1,000, the Death Rate for the County of London, and with 13.4 per 1,000, the figure, for the 7 7 large towns. The Death Rate for Greenwich corrected for difference of age and sex constitution in the population, equals 11-8 per 1,000. Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to their corrected Death Rate, which is the fairest method of comparison, shows that Greenwich has the lowest Death Rate but 6 amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs. The 6 Boroughs having a better Death Rate than Greenwich being Hampstead, Lewisham, Wandsworth, Woolwich, Stoke Newington and Fulham. Full particulars of all the Boroughs in this respect, are to be found in the table on page 18. 10 The Infantile Mortality Rate, for the Borough, measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered, was 108, an increase of 6 compared with last year; the figure for London as a whole was 103, and the Borough average during the last five years, 1905-1909, inclusive, 113. The Zymotic Death Rate of 1.38 per 1,000 is .24 per 1,000 above the County average, viz., 1.31 per 1,000, and is 0.39 per 1,000 above the corresponding figure for last year. This increase in the Zymotic Death Rate is practically all accounted for by the larger number of deaths from Whooping Cough in Greenwich during this year. The average Death Rate from this Disease throughout the County of London being -28 per 1,000, whereas the death rate from this disease in Greenwich was .50 per 1,000. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows:— Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhœa Death Rate. Consumption Death Rate.

In conclusion I have again to tender my best thanks to each and all Members of the Council, and the Public Health Committee in particular, for their continued kindness and support, and also to the Members of the Staff for the manner in which their duties have been performed. I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, ERNEST G. ANNIS. 12 VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1910. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the •middle of the year is 1 12,935. This estimate is an increase of 1,921 upon the corresponding figure of last year. The natural increase of the population during the year, or the excess of the number of births over the number of deaths is 1,121, which therefore allows #00 as the balance of immigrants over emigrants. As the annual report for this year has to do with the last year of the intercensal period, it is quite possible that these estimates of population may have to be altered in some of their details, but it is thought that the total for the whole Borough will not be considerably altered. The distribution of the population throughout the Borough is as follows:— Census, 1901. Estimated Population at middle of year 1910. East Greenwich 4:5,8 59 51,721 West Greenwich 23,456 27,659 St. Nicholas 7,321 8,633 Charlton 1 8,065 21,293 Kidbrooke 3,069 3,629 Total 95,770 112,935 MARRIAGES. The Superintendent-Registrar of the Greenwich Union has kindly furnished me with the particulars relating to the number of marriages solemnized in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent-Registrar for the Woolwich Union has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, 13 with the exception, in these latter particulars, that none of the marriages performed in the Woolwich Registrar's Office and in Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are included. The following table shews these particulars, giving the number of Marriages in Greenwich and St. Nicholas, etc., for each year since 1893. Year. In Churches of England in Greenwich. In Churches of England in Charlton am Kidbrooke. In St. Nicholas Parish Church.

The total number of births in the Borough during the year has been 2,45 7, but of these 55 occurred in Greenwich Union Infirmary, the address of the mother being in 55 cases in Deptford, and 1 in the Miller Hospital belonging to Deptford; deducting these and adding 9 14 which were transferred from the City of London Hospital, Lambeth and Poplar, it will be seen that the number of strictly Greenwich births for 1910 is 2,410, of which 1,218 were males and 1,192 females. This corrected figure gives a birth rate of 21-41 per 1,000 of the population, being the lowest on record, and 4-19 below the average for the last nine years, 1901 to 1909, the period since the formation of the Metropolitan Borough. Amongst the total number of births registered in the Borough there were 89 in which the name of the father was not registered and therefore not given in the return; accordingly these births may be presumed to be of an illegitimate character. 70 of such births were registered in the East Greenwich district, which includes the Infirmary of the Greenwich Union. In 32 cases the mother was ordinarily a resident in the Borough of Deptford, and accordingly this number of births have been transferred to that Borough. The remaining 5 7 were similarly allocated to the districts in this Borough in which the mother ordinarily resided, making 26 of such births belonging to East Greenwich, 17 to West Greenwich, 9 to St. Nicholas, and 5 to Charlton. The birth rate for the County of London equals 23.6 per 1,000 of the population, and was the lowest rate recorded. It varied from 13.3 in the City of London, 14.0 in Hampstead, 15.2 in the City of Westminster, 17.5 in Kensington, and 18.0 in Stoke Newington, up to 29.7 in Poplar, 29.9 in Finsbury, 316 in Bermondsey, 31.7 in Shoreditch, and 32.1 in Bethnal Green. 15 Under the provisions of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, intimations have been received from medical men, parents, and others, with respect to 2,029 births, from which it will be seen that we have 219 intimations to be credited to births which were registered during the latter part of 1909, or will be registered during the early part of 1911, as the time allowed by law for registration purposes extends up to six weeks, whereas that under the Notification of Births Act is to be within 36 hours. Copies of the notifications received are transmitted to the County Council as required by the Act, and from time to time the various District Registrars within the district consult our records shewing the actual notifications received. In one or two cases slight irregularities have been detected, particularly in connection with the address given to us where the birth has actually occurred and the address as furnished to the Registrar for the purposes of registering the birth. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during 1910 was 1,289, of which 628 were males, and 661 females. The crude death rate for the Borough of 11.45 per 1,000, compares favourably with 12.7, the death rate for the County of London, and 13.4 the death rate for the 77 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude death rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 8.6 in Hampstead, 9.6 in Lewisham, 10.2 in Wandsworth, 10.5 in Fulham and Woolwich, and 11-0 in Stoke Newington; while the highest rates were 15.2 in Poplar, 15.3 in Bethnal Green, 15.5 in the City of London, 15.9 in Southwark, 16.7 in Shoreditch, 17.6 in Finsbury, and 17.7 in Bermondsey. 16 Locally, the death rate varied from 4-70 in Kidbrooke,. 9-09 in Charlton, 11-19 in East Greenwich, and 13-71 in West Greenwich, to 14-46 in St. Nicholas. The. following table shows the variation in, and average of, the death rates in each of the five Districts of the Borough in the five years 190.5 to 1909, compared with the figures for 1910: — District. 1900. lSWXi. 1907. 1008. 1909.

This certainly shows a very satisfactory decrease during the 10 years of the Council's existence. Speaking generally it will be seen that this decline is fairly proportionate throughout the whole of the Borough with the exception of St. Nicholas, Deptford, which, however, shews a marked improvement in this respect. In 1901 the death rate stood at 2 3 per 1,000, whereas for the last year, as will be seen above, it is at the comparatively satisfactory figure of 14-46 per 1,000. It may be, however, that these figures will not appear in such a satisfactory light when the results of the recent census are known. 17 DEATHS IN INSTITUTIONS.

The Infantile Mortality, measured by the deaths of children under one year of age to the number of births registered, was 108 per 1,000 births, there having been a total of 261 such deaths during the year, as compared with 251, 310, and 259, the figures for the three preceding years. The number for the County of London was 103 per 1,000 births. The lowest rates of Infantile Mortality amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs were 60 per 1,000 births in Hampstead, 64 in Stoke Newington, 66 in the City of London, 80 in Lewisham, and 84 in the City of Westminster; whilst the highest were 122 in Deptford, 123 in Finsbury and Bethnal Green, 126 in Bermondsey, and 146 in Shoreditch. Locally, the variations were from 63 per 1,000 births in Kidbrooke, 80 in Charlton, 108 in East Greenwich, 121 in West Greenwich, and 123 in St. Nicholas; the following table compares, at a glance, these figures for the years since the formation of the Borough:— District.

Infective Diseases. Epidemic. There were 173 deaths due to this class of diseases, equalling a death rate of 1.54 per 1,000; the rate last year was 1.14, and was l-47 and I-65 in 1908 and 1907 respectively. The Zymotic Death Rate for the County of London equals 1.14 per 1,000, wherein it varied from 0.46 in Hampstead, 0.47 in the City of Westminster, 0.48 in the City of London, 0.58 in Stoke Ncwington, 0.61 in Wandsworth and Woolwich, up to 1.90 in Shoreditch, 1.92 in Finsbury, 2.02 in Southwark, and 2.44 in Bermondsey. The increase in our Zymotic Death Rate appears to be chiefly due to a serious outbreak of measles, which occasioned a total of 47 deaths, and especially to the large number of fatalities from whooping cough; there having been a total of 5 6 such deaths during the year, and in the case of the latter disease being 30 above the average number of deaths for the last five years. Locally the Zymotic Death Rate varied from 0-83 in Kidbrooke (0-00 in 1909), 0 33 in Charlton (1-01 in 1909), 1-46 in East Greenwich (1-03 in 1909), 1-67 in West Greenwich (0-74 in 1909), up to 2-80 in St. St. Nicholas (2 01 in 1909). Small-Pox. There were no deaths from this disease in 1910, this being the eighth year since a death occurred from this cause in the Borough. Measles. Forty-seven deaths were ascribed as due to this disease, two only of the patients being over five years of age; compared with 3 8 which occurred in 1909, 23 16, 55, and 29 deaths were recorded in the three preceding years. Twenty-seven of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 13 in West Greenwich, 5 in St. Nicholas, and 1 each in Charlton and Kidbrooke. The quarterly incidence was 14 in the first, and 29, 3 and 1 respectively in the succeeding quarters. Scarlet Fever. This disease occasioned 3 deaths, all being under 5 years of age; there was 1 in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, and 1 in St. Nicholas. Eight such deaths occurred in 1909 and 6 in 1908. Diphtheria. There were 10 deaths from this disease during 1909. This gives a death rate for Diphtheria of 0-09, comparing with 0-06, the rate for 1909. Seven deaths occurred in 1909, which were attributed to this cause, and 18, 20 and 30 in the three preceding years. Four of the patients were under five years of age, 2 of them dying in the Brook Hospital, and 0 of the patients were over five years of age, and of these 5 died in the Brook Hospital. There was a further number of 17 deaths from Diphtheria in patients not ordinarily resident in this Borough, but under treatment at tbe Brook Hospital. Thirteen tubes of Diphtheria Anti-toxin, containing a total of 52,000 units of serum, for the treatment of patients suffering from this disease, have been supplied by this Council during the year. Whooping Cough. This disease was given as the cause of 56 deaths in 1910, as against 20, 31 and 26 in the three preceding years. These deaths equal a rate of 0-50 per 1,000. There were 2 patients over five years of age. Twenty-four of the deaths occurred in East 24 Greenwich, 19 in West Greenwich, 11 in St. Nicholas, 1 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. As stated above, this disease was present throughout the whole of the Borough during the early part of the year, particularly the first quarter of the year, in a very malignant form. The average number of deaths during the last five years being 26, whereas this year that number was more than doubled. This is one of the serious infective diseases which up to the present the Sanitary Authority does little or nothing to prevent or control, and I certainly think that the time is not far distant when public) opinion will call for some action in reference to this disease on similar lines to those already adopted in connection with other diseases of this class. Typhoid Fever. There were three deaths ascribed as due to this disease; there were 3 in 1909, 9 in 1908, and 5 each in 1907, 1906 and 1905. One of the deaths was in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, and 1 in Charlton. One was treated in the Brook Hospital. Diarrhœa and Zymotic Enteritis. Thirty-five deaths were stated to be due to this cause, equalling a rate of 0.31 per 1,000. Last year there were 34 deaths, and 49, 33 and 66 respectively in the three preceding years. The deaths were distributed as follows:—Seventeen in East Greenwich, 7 in West Greenwich, 7 in St. Nicholas, and 4 in Charlton. Two patients were over five years of age. Influenza. Influenza is found to have been the responsible cause in 18 deaths in 1910; 24 was the average of the previous three years. Of the 18, 11 were over sixty-five years of age. 24A This Diagram gives in comparative form the Deaths from those Diseases which have caused the principal amount of Mortality during 1910. DEATHS FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES, 1910. 25 Sporadic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of disease during the year. Venereal. Syphilis. Six deaths were given as due to Syphilis, as against 5 in 1909, and 4 in 1908. Of these 6 deaths, 3 were children under five years of age. Two occurred in East Greenwich, 3 in West Greenwich, and 1 in Charlton. One of the deceased persons was in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, and 1 in the Miller Hospital. There were no deaths from Gonorrhoea during the year. Septic. Erysipelas. Three deaths occurred from this cause in 1910, 1 in 1909, 5 in 1908, and 3 in 190 7. Puerperal Fever. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Pyæemia and Septicæmia. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Infective Endocarditis. Four deaths were ascribed to this cause, 1 in East Greenwich, 2 in West Greenwich, and 1 in St. Nicholas. The numbers were 2 in 1909, and 3 in 1908. There were 2 deaths from the other diseases of the septic class. Malarial. Rheumatic Fever. This disease was the cause of 4 deaths in 1910, as compared with 4 in 1909, 6 in 1908, and 6 in 1907. Rheumatism of the Heart was the cause of 2 deaths. There were no deaths from Malarial Fever. Tuberculosis. This class includes the causes of 136 deaths during the year under review, with a rate of 1.21; these figures compare with 146, 171, and 143, the totals of the previous three years, and respective rates of 1.32, 1.54, and 1.34. 26 Tuberculosis of Lungs (Consumption) is, as usual, credited with the major portion of these deaths, there being 108 attributed to this cause, or a rate of 0.96 per 1,000, comparing with 1.14 per 1,000, the phthisis death rate for the whole of London. Amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs this death rate ranged from 0.55 in Lewisham, 0.59 in Hampstead, 0.77 in Kensington, 0.84 in Paddington, 0.86 in Wandsworth, up to 1.70 in Finsbury and the City of London, 1.74 in Southwark, 1.76 in Bermondsey, and 1.98 in Holborn. Locally, the deaths were nil in Kidbrooke, 10 in St. Nicholas, giving a death rate of 0.91; 19 in Charlton, giving a death rate of 1.17; 25 in West Greenwich, giving a death rate of 0.91; and 54 in East Greenwich, giving a death rate of 1.05 per 1,000. The remaining forms of Tuberculosis were responsible for 28 deaths, 11 being in East Greenwich, 5 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, 9 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Of these other forms of Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of the Brain or its Membranes was credited with 13, 9 being under five years of age; Tubercle affecting the Intestines, 7 deaths (3 being under five years of age); General Tuberculosis, 3 deaths (0 under and 3 over five); and other forms 5. The voluntary notification of cases of Consumption continues in force in the Borough, and is, as the figures show, still appreciated by medical men in the district; 177 such notifications have been received and dealt with during the year, the numbers in preceding years having been 199, 107, 107, 112, 109. Seventy-six of these notifications were in East Greenwich, 29 in West Greenwich. 60 in St. Nicholas, and 12 in Charlton. 27 Parasitic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of disease. Dietic Diseases. There were 3 deaths from this class of disease, giving a rate of 0.03, all being chronic alcoholism. Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from this cause were 101 in number, which gives a rate of 0.90 per 1,000. Of these 80 were attributed to Cancer, 13 to Diabetes, 3 to Gout, 3 to Anaemia, and 2 to OsteoArthritis. The deaths from Cancer were distributed as follows: 37 occurred in East Greenwich, 23 in West Greenwich, 5 in St. Nicholas, 14 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Developmental Diseases. There were 230 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 2.04 per 1,000. These may roughly be divided into those from causes which would appear to be unavoidable, viz.:—Atelectasis 4, Congenital defects 5, and those from causes more or less preventible, viz.:—Premature birth 49, Injury at birth 3, Debility at birth 11, Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus 27, Rickets 5, want of Breast Milk 1, and Dentition 8. The remaining and largest portion of these deaths from developmental diseases, 117 in number, were from Old Age; in 1909 there were 147 deaths from this cause, and 134 in the previous year. Local Diseases. Nervous System. One hundred and fourteen deaths were attributed to the various nervous diseases, which gives a rate of 1.01 per 1,000; last year the rate was 1.30 per 1,000. Convulsions were responsible for 15, all being under five years of age; 28 8 were from Meningitis, 48 from Apoplexy, 2 from Softening of the Brain, 9 from Hemiplegia or Brain Paralysis, 6 from General Paralysis of the Insane, 2 from other forms of Insanity, 7 from Cerebral Tumour, 7 from Epilepsy, 2 from Locomotor Ataxy, 5 from Paraplegia, and 3 from the other diseases of this system. Organs of Special Sense. There was 1 death from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 0.01 per 1,000. Circulatory System. The death rate from diseases of this system was 1.19 per 1,000, there being a total of 134 such deaths. Valvular diseases of the heart were responsible for 121; 5 from Embolism, 2 from Angina Pectoris, and 1 each from Aneurism and Senile Gangrene, and from the remaining diseases of this system, 4. Respiratory System. Two hundred and nineteen deaths were due to diseases of the respiratory organs, as compared with 237 in the preceding year. The death rate under this heading equals 1.94 per 1,000. Forty-three were from Acute and 47 from Chronic Bronchitis; 120 from the various forms of Pneumonia, 59 being under five years of age; 4 were from Asthma, 4 from Pleurisy, and 1 from the other diseases of the Respiratory System. Digestive System. There were 59 deaths from diseases of this system, equal to a rate of 0.52 per 1,000, Enteritis was responsible for 18, 16 being under five years of age; 6 were due to Ulcer of Stomach and Duodenum, 7 to Appendicitis, 9 to obstruction and other diseases of the Intestine, 9 to Cirrhosis and 2 to other diseases of the Liver, 6 to Peritonitis, and 2 to the other diseases of the digestive system. Lymphatic System. There were 2 deaths from diseases affecting this system, equal to a rate of 0.02 per 1,000. 29 Urinary System. Forty-one deaths, equal to a rate of 0.36 per 1,000, occurred from diseases affecting this system. Twenty-nine were from Bright's Disease, 1 from Acute Nephritis, 8 from diseases of the Bladder and Prostate, and 3 from other and ill-defined diseases of the urinary system. Reproductive System. Diseases of the generative organs were the cause of 4 deaths. There were 4 deaths attributed to diseases of Parturition. Bones and Joints. There were 4 deaths from diseases of bones and joints. Integumentary System. There were no diseases of this class. External Causes. There were 37 deaths given as due to causes grouped under this heading; 31 were the result of accident or negligence, and the remaining 6 were from Suicide. Suffocation, by being overlaid in bed, was the cause of death of 3 children under five years of age; 2 cases were from drowning, while accidents on railways, in vehicular traffic and in building operations and falls, etc., were responsible for 32 deaths. The Suicides were by hanging in 2 cases, 2 by poison, and 1 each by cut or stab, and, by precipitation from elevated places. No death has been left so insufficiently described as to need classification under the ill-defined causes heading, and this is a most satisfactory feature. MORTUARY.

During the year 622 cases have been notified under the above Act, as compared with 879, 887, and 1,134 respectively, in the preceding years, 1909, 1908, and 1907. Small-pox. No case of this disease was notified during the year in persons residing in this Borough. Intimations respecting 8 Small-pox contacts were received from the Southampton Port Sanitary Authority, all of whom were visited and watched during the necessary incubation period. Two from the Tees Port Sanitary Authority; one of these became ill, went into the Seamen's Hospital for treatment, and was there certified to be suffering from Small-pox. This diagnosis, however, was not verified, it being found to be a case of chicken pox. The warning and advice given in my last Annual Report with respect to obtaining protection against an attack of Small-pox by means of efficient vaccination or revaccination need not be repeated in extenso, it being sufficient to say that, in my opinion, the necessity for this warning is greater now than it was twelve months ago, and in this respect a word to the wise will doubtless be sufficient. 31 Vaccination Return for the period July to December, 1909. Return made on or before the 8th of August, 1910, by Mr. A. E.

One hundred and sixty cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, as compared with 155, 221, 253, and 397, respectively, in the four previous years. The distribution of these cases was as follows:— 99 in East Greenwich, 39 in West Greenwich, 10 in St. Nicholas, 6 in Charlton, and 6 in Kidbrooke. Of this total number 142 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. Amongst which number the Hospital Authorities reported that in five cases they considered the diagnosis incorrect—four of the cases being thought to be Tonsilitis and one case of Vincent's Angina. There were 10 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 6.3 per cent. Nine hundred and eighty-four specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 850 were reported to give negative or doubtful results, and 134 were positive in character, being dealt with accordingly. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1910 has been as follows:— 1st Quarter.— East Greenwich, 16 cases; West Greenwich, 15; St. Nicholas, 6; Kidbrooke, 1; a total of 38 cases. 2nd Quarter.— East Greenwich, 18 cases; West Greenwich, 5; St. Nicholas, 3; Kidbrooke, 1; a total of 27 cases. 3rd Quarter.— East Greenwich, 43 cases; West Greenwich, 12; St. Nicholas, 1; Charlton, 2; Kidbrooke, 3; a total of 61 cases. 35 4th Quarter.— East Greenwich, 22 cases; West Greenwich, 7; Charlton, 4; Kidbrooke, 1; a total of 34 cases. All persons of school age who are known to have been in contact with a case, and, where suspicion arises, adults as well, are examined with a view to stopping the spread of infection. In this way one frequently finds the person who has apparently been the original cause of the outbreak, their illness having been in many cases, and continuing to be of such a mild character, in fact the only symptom being a cold and sore throat as it is thought, whereas on careful examination one finds the specific organism present. Further enquiries shew that this cold and sore throat was in evidence before the first case was notified in the house, hence one may be legitimately excused if one considers that this case might have been of an infectious character almost from its commencement, and that on more suitable soil being infected the disease manifested itself in a more virulent form. Cases in point might be frequently given, but the two following will suffice:— On making enquiries with respect to the origin of the infection in a notified case—child W.—11, F. Road—no source of infection could be found in the house or other members of the same family. The information was obtained that this child had been a constant companion of a neighbouring child—D., at 17, F. Road—and that this companion had been suffering from what was presumed to be a cold and sore throat for some weeks. On visiting this house it was found that some of the children were still complaining of having sore throat, but were attending school. One child, however, who was obviously too ill to attend school was examined, and was found to be definitely suffering from Diphtheria, this being the companion referred to above; on further examining the other children 36 who at this date were attending school, it was found that two of them also gave positive bacteriological results. In another case, a child—C. G., 26, B. Place—was notified as suffering from Diphtheria and removed to the Hospital, the premises being disinfected, all the other children on examination gave negative bacteriological results, but on enquiry it was found that the father, D. G., had been suffering for a month previously from some throat affection—he had, however, been under medical treatment for what was supposed to be severe quinsy, although as he had suffered from quinsy frequently before he himself noticed that this affection was much different to his previous illnesses. On my communicating with the medical attendant he informed me that he thought this case had been one of severe quinsy, and that the patient had shewn some little evidence of paralysis. Afterwards, on my examining the father, almost a pure culture of Diphtheria Bacilli was obtained, accordingly he was then notified as suffering from Diphtheria and removed to the Hospital for treatment. The Diphtheria Bacilli persisted in his throat in spite of treatment for a period of nine weeks before a negative result was obtained. Undoubtedly this was the first case in this household, but the diagnosis having been overlooked other cases arose which led in this way to the finding of the original case. Amongst the children excluded from school on account of throat affection or suspected Diphtheria, or because they were actual contacts with Diphtheria cases, who were examined by me, 48 were definitely found to be harbouring the Diphtheria Bacillus, and 12 of these gave a positive reaction on a subsequent examination. Of these 48 cases, 22 were definitely notified by a medical practitioner in the district as suffering from Diphtheria, the remaining 26 cases, however, rapidly cleared up under ZYMOTIC DISEASES NOTIFIED. Shewing the Number of Cases of these Diseases notified during each week throughout the year 1910. ZYMOTIC DISEASES NOTIFIED. Shewing the Number of Cases of these Diseases notified during each week throughout the year 1910. 37 simple home treatment, and then gave a negative bacteriological result. As stated above, some of these 48 cases were undoubtedly the origin of some of the cases of Diphtheria definitely previously notified, although, because these cases were much milder in character, therefore not found out until after the development of the much more serious case. Erysipelas. Eighty-six cases were notified during the year, 23 being in East Greenwich, 32 in West Greenwich, 25 in St. Nicholas, 5 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Thirteen of these patients were removed to Public Institutions in the District. Scarlet Fever. One hundred and seventy cases were notified during the year, as compared with 390, 423, and 660 cases, respectively, in the three preceding years; 68 cases were in East Greenwich, 57 in West Greenwich, 17 in St. Nicholas, 22 in Charlton, and 6 in Kidbrooke; 146 of these cases were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 3 deaths from this disease during the year as against 8 last year. Seventeen of the cases removed to the Hospital as suffering from Scarlet Fever were returned as wrongly diagnosed, and 8 stated to be Rotheln, 3 from Erythema, 1 each Bronchitis, Measles, Tonsilitis, Erythema and Appendicitis, Erythema and Pertussis, no alternative disease, however, being stated in the remaining case, while 4 patients on discharge were still suffering, 3 from Chronic Rhinorrhœa, and 1 from Otorrhœa, and parents were duly notified of this. The following Table gives particulars of the four cases which would seem to be "return cases." There were ten such cases in 1909, eight in 1908, and five in 1907. 38 Table shewing Return Cases of Scarlet Fever during Year 1910. No. of Case. Date of Removal of Primary Case.

There were 19 cases of Typhoid Fever notified during the year, 7 being in East Greenwich, 8 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, and 2 in Charlton. The ages of the patients were: 1 between one and five years, 5 between five and fifteen years, 7 between fifteen and twenty-five years, and 6 between twentyfive and sixty-five years. Of the total number of cases, 17 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. Twentyeight such cases occurred in 1909, and 34 in 1908; the average number for the years 1901 to 1909 inclusive, being 42. Of the total number removed to the Hospital for treatment 1 case, however, was returned, as in the opinion of the Medical Superintendent not suffering from Typhoid Fever, the disease from which the patient was considered to be suffering not being stated. There were 3 fatalities from this disease during the year, 1 belonging to East Greenwich, 1 to West Greenwich, and 1 to Charlton. Twenty-three specimens were forwarded for bacteriological examination from cases suspected to be Typhoid Fever in character, and of this number 16 gave a negative result, and 7 were positive in character. During this year an interesting investigation has been conducted by one of the Medical Inspectors of the Local Government Board into the question as to the number of typhoid carrier cases in London. In connection with this investigation arrangements were made for the bacteriological examination of specimens of the dejecta at monthly intervals for a period of six months after their discharge from the Hospital as recovered from an attack of Typhoid Fever, and under the scheme investigations have been carried out with 13 patients; one of these 40 patients, however, shortly after discharge from the Hospital removed to Cardiff, whilst another of the patients after the third examination also left the district for a neighbouring Borough; one patient refused to provide further samples after the first two examinations. Of the total number of examinations of these patients only one was found to give at any time positive results, and this was a patient who had been somewhat abruptly discharged from the Fever Hospital for the purpose of having an operation performed at Guy's Hospital, and after her convalescence from that operation she was discharged from that hospital. Just previous to her discharge, however, it was thought advisable, just as a matter of curiosity, to examine her dejecta, when to the surprise of the authorities it was found that there were large numbers of typhoid organisms present; the patient, however, had been in the interval discharged, and this information was forwarded to me by post. The address given by the patient was, however, found to be incorrect, and some little time elapsed before we were able to satisfactorily trace her. She was then, however, kept under observation for four months, for the first three of which positive results were obtained, the fourth examination, however, proved negative, and after this she removed from this district to a neighbouring Borough. 41 Fish and Enteric Fever.

Five deaths from this disease were notified during the year, 3 in West Greenwich, 1 in St. Nicholas, and 1 in Charlton. There were 8 cases in 1909, and 2 in 1908; 4 of these patients were removed to the Hospital. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Particular enquiries were made respecting the source of infection in each case, but in no way did there appear to be any common origin. Measles. Nine hundred and sixty-nine cases of Measles were notified during the year, as compared with 795 during the previous year, and 497, 1,245 and 482 in the years 1908, 1907 and 1906, respectively. Each case was visited, and the usual measures of disinfecting generally carried out. It will be seen that the incidence of this outbreak was particularly felt during the second quarter of the year, during which period some threefourths of the total cases were heard of. No particular district of the Borough appears to have been specially exempt. The ages and incidence of the disease will also be seen to be as follows:— Of the total number, 32 were children under one year of age, amongst which cases there occurred seven fatalities, equal to a case mortality of 22 per cent. There were 454 cases between one and five years of age, amongst whom there were 38 deaths, giving a case mortality of 8.3 per cent. Between the ages of five to fifteen years there were 479, with only 2 deaths at this age period, giving a case mortality of 0.4 per cent. There were 4 cases at ages twenty-five to sixtyfive, with no deaths. The case mortality of the whole district works out at 4.9 per cent. From a consideration of the above figures it will be seen how fatal a disease Measles is, as it affects children under the age of five years, for if the same proportion 43 of deaths had occurred at ages under five years as did actually occur at all ages over five years there would have been a total of only 4 deaths, as compared with -17 which did actually occur. Therefore any steps which can be taken to defer the age at which a child becomes subject to this infection is a distinct gain, and although the number of actual cases at the higher ages will thereby be materially increased, yet the total number of deaths ascribed to this disease will apparently be very considerably decreased. One of the chief steps which might be taken in this respect, in my opinion, is by not admitting to school any child under the age of five years, as undoubtedly by this means we should guard these children from the fatal infection obtained by reason of their school attendance. Of course this would not obviate their being brought into contact with the infection if it were brought home bymeans of another child sickening for the disease, but the result of my observations tends to show that by far the larger number of fresh centres of infection are brought about by means of school attendance and aggregating together of susceptible material in a classroom in close proximity to any focus of infection. This reasoning appears to be almost accepted by the London County Council Education Authorities, for we find that from time to time they give directions that in certain classes all children under the age of five years are to be excluded from attendance for a certain period. This is done undoubtedly with the very good object of preventing these young children coming into the focus of infection at the time when there is a grave suspicion of the infection being present, but it seems to me that this is only a sort of trifling with the matter, and that it would 44 be far better not to have these children in school at all, and hence not run the constant risk of having them brought into the presence of the infection in school. Doubtless some enthusiastic educationalists may say that non-attendance at school under five years of age would affect the child's education, but I think that no child's scholastic education should be allowed to commence at an age less than five years, and, in my judgment, it seems almost a crime to allow children at the advanced age of three years to seriously attend school, when, in my opinion, they most certainly should be under the mother's immediate care and supervision. It may further be advanced that many mothers would not devote much supervision or care to their young children in this way, but I would say more shame to the mothers for so neglecting their young children, and that anything that could be done to hinder such parental neglect, and on the other hand foster a better mothering and homely care for these young children should be attempted. 45 Table shewing number of Measles Cases reported during the year 1910. 1ST QUARTER.

The patient was between the age of one and five years, and died in the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, to which place he had been taken for treatment. Isolation Shelter. This shelter was not used during the year. Contacts. Intimation was received from the Medical Officers of Health to the various Port Sanitary Authorities on 16 occasions during the year in this connection. On 8 occasions with respect to persons coming to an address in this district from a vessel where cases of cholera had developed, and on 8 occasions from vessels which had had a Small-pox case on board. Each of these persons was kept under observation. Glanders. Under the Glanders Order, notification has been made to this authority during the year with respect to 5 differ outbreaks of Glanders. Enquiries have been made in each case, and no human Glanders has appeared to result therefrom. Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia. No notification of any case of these diseases in man has been received during the year. Consumption. During the year there were 177 cases of Consumption voluntarily notified, 76 being in East Greenwich, 29 in West Greenwich, GO in St. Nicholas, and 12 in Charlton. Of this number 44 cases were under treatment in an Institution. The ages of the patients were, 4 under one year of age, 6 between one and five years, 30 between five and fifteen years, 28 between fifteen and twenty-five years, 100 between twenty-five and sixty-five years, and 9 over sixty-five years. 47 Sixty-nine specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be consumptive; 50 were reported to be negative, and 19 positive. Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 66 cases, including 74 rooms and 136 articles of bedding, etc.; disinfectant has also been supplied to patients to disinfect sputum, etc. In my opinion there is a very great need for some Institution in the district on the lines of the Tuberculosis or Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensaries how springing up in various parts of London and the Provinces, whereby means are provided for definitely not only treating persons actually suffering from Tuberculosis but searching out cases, particularly those in the early stage, getting them placed under appropriate treatment before the disease has developed too far. Communications have been received from the Society for the motion of Tuberculosis Dispensaries, which communication has been forwarded to the Governors of the Miller Hospital, as in my opinion it would be far preferable to utilise the services of an existing Institution in this way rather than build and develop an Institution solely for this purpose, which would undoubtedly in a measure become a competitor with existing Institutions. The governing body of the Miller Hospital are very kindly taking this matter into their careful and serious consideration, and I have hopes that some definite means may be speedily adopted for the achievement of this object. The following table shows the number and character of the notifications received under the recent Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations: — 48 1st Notification. 1st Quarter. 2nd Notification. 3rd Notification.

GREENWICH HEALTH SOCIETY. This Society continues to make slow but satisfactory progress in the Borough. Changes in the management have now been carried out, the late Secretary feeling compelled to resign the post on account of ill health, and a new Secretary having been found in the person of Mrs. Cooper Key, of the Royal Naval College, under whose able direction it is thought that this Society will grow and continue to do its good work. There is still a great need, however, for suitable visitors, and I think 49 many ladies of ease and leisure in the Borough could do far worse with their spare time than by offering themselves as visitors to this Society, and thus utilise some of their spare time in endeavourifig to better the position and encourage their sisters of the poorer classes whose lines are not cast in such pleasant places, who are much hampered by want of knowledge, and who as a rule much appreciate the kindly visit and sympathy of a suitable visitor.

The Table on pages 7 3 to 79 summarizes, as far as possible, the Sanitary Work of the Department; from this it will be seen that a total of 15,569 houses and premises have been inspected or reinspected during the year ; 1,497 intimation notices have been served, and 434 statutory notices. With the exception of prosecutions in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, it was only found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings in four cases, one being in connection with nuisance from the emission of black smoke, one being for sanitary defects; one for defective drains, and one for carrying offensive refuse during prohibited hours. There were altogether throughout the year 322 complaints entered in the Public Complaint Register of the Department; these were in each case carefully investigated, and any necessary action immediately taken, thus there are none of these matters left outstanding or unattended to. Bakehouses. One hundred and ninety-five inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 38 nuisances found therein have been abated as the result. Factories and Workshops. One hundred and fifty inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 238 workshop premises on the Register at the beginning of the year, 30 have been added during the year, and 6 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 262. This total number includes 21 laundries, 36 dressmakers, 8 fuel and firewood works, 5 cycle works, 7 milliners, and 53 various others, including workplaces, such as 4 blacksmiths, 13 barge builders, 4 builders' yards, etc. Information has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories with respect to 4 new workshops, and also 3 instances where protected persons were employed on premises no abstract being displayed. One complaint has been received from H.M. Inspector and also 8 intimations respecting alleged new workshops; of these 8 however, only 4 were really new premises, the other 4 relating to premises which had already been notified by us to H.M. Inspector. The inspections have revealed the presence of defects or insanitary conditions requiring the service of many verbal, and in addition, 40 written notices, 30 of these being in respect of workshops, including workshop laundries, and 16 in respect of work-places. The notices had reference to want of cleanliness generally in 62 cases, want of ventilation in 2 cases, unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation 12 cases, and other nuisances 23 cases, also for Breach of Special Sanitary Requirements for Bakehouses in 10 cases. These defects have all been attended to. Outworkers' Registers. Seventy-three lists of Outworkers, containing 27 7 names and addresses, have been received during the year from Medical Officers of Health for other Districts; 26 lists, containing 200 names, have been received from employers within the District; 29 lists, containing 70 names, have been forwarded to other Districts, thus giving a total of 40 7 names and addresses of outworkers within the Borough. Two hundred and ninety-seven visits of inspection have been made to these premises, and insanitary conditions, mainly want of cleanliness have been revealed in 25 instances; 25 written notices were served with respect to these matters. 54 FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES and HOMEWORK. 1.—INSPECTION.

Inspectors 1 Other Underground Bakehouses (s. 101) :— In use during 1909 18 Certificates granted in 1910 In use at the end of 1910 17 Unoccupied „ 1910 1 Slaughter Houses. The slaughter houses in the Borough have been inspected on 54 occasions by the Inspectors. 58 Cowhouses. The four cowhouses in the Borough have been visited on 13 occasions, and the required cleansing has been duly enforced on 12 occasions. Horse Slaughterer. The one horse-slaughtering house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector on 19 occasions, and cleansing of the premises was required on 3 of these visits. During the year these premises have been entirely rebuilt and remodelled, in accordance with the recent requirements of the London County Council, so that now the whole of the operations carried out in these premises are carried out within enclosed chambers, the offensive smell and fumes from which are conducted by means of flues over a coke furnace and into a shaft before emission to the outer atmosphere. Personally I am somewhat dubious as to the advantages likely to be derived from this very considerable outlay, because from our experience of the old premises really bona fide complaints of objectionable smells arising therefrom were very seldom found to exist, but at any rate these premises now comply with the requirements of the London County Council By-laws, and undoubtedly the previous premises did not. It however remains to be seen what effect these considerable alterations have upon the emanations from these premises into the surrounding neighbourhood. Other Scheduled Offensive Trades. The 63 other premises where these offensive trades are carried on notably within the precincts of the Foreign Animals' Wharf, Deptford, have been frequently visited, and the requirements of this Authority have always immediately received attention. During the year communications were received from the London County Council, drawing the attention of this 59 Council to the fact that certain premises occupied by various firms employed in the Gut-scraping business and in Tripe boiling, were not built in accordance with the London County Council By-laws. Inspection was madeof these premises and it was found that they did not comply with the letter of the By-laws in many respects. Permission was obtained to inspect premises in another Borough which were admitted by the London County Council to be in accordance with their by-laws, and as a result of such inspection, and a comparison of the conditions found in the two sets of premises, I came to theconclusion that the conditions existing in the Foreign Cattle Market were infinitely preferable to those found in the other premises referred to. Representations were accordingly made to the London County Council to this effect, and under the circumstances this Council declined to take proceedings against the various firms for not having their premises in compliance with the by-laws. At an interview between Sir Shirley Murphy, the Medical Officer to the London County Council, and myself, I strongly insisted upon the need for differentiation between these various premises, and on the grounds that these premises were considerably removed from dwelling-houses that the whole of the material dealt with on the premises was dealt with in quite a fresh state, always within 24 hours of its production, and that there was a large amount of air-space and fresh air permeating this neighbourhood by reason of its proximity to the river, and the large open spaces in the Cattle Market premises themselves. On these grounds arrangements were made that action against any or all of these various firms should at any rate be delayed until after this forthcoming summer, so that observations may be kept upon the premises during the warmer weather of the summer months. (50 Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. At the commencement of the year, there were 2 0G premises on the Register of Dairies and Milkshops; 11 new applications have been received during the year and added to the Register, and 35 names have been taken off, thus leaving a total of 182 premises now registered. During the year 261 visits of inspection have been paid to these premises; notices were served upon the occupiers in 22 cases, 9 of which were for dirty premises generally, in 1 case for dirty milk vessels and utensils, and in 12 instances for general insanitary conditions. Under the powers conferred by the London County Council (General) Powers Act. 1908, Section 5, with respect to the registration of premises unsuitable for the sale of milk, such registration has been refused on the grounds of the unsuitability of the premises in 6 cases. Ice Cream Premises. There were 118 premises known at the commencement of the year where the manufacture of this commodity was carried on, 15 have been added during the year and 7 taken off. leaving a total of 120 premises. These premises were inspected on 134 occasions, and improvements, either by way of cleansing of the premises in 11 cases, or the remedying of sanitary defects in 3 cases, and 5 suitable ash receptacles required. The London County Council included in the General Powers Bill of this year clauses calculated to cure the defect in the law, which was set out fully in the Annual Report for last year, whereby the same provisions were to have effect with reference to a stand as appertain to a cart or barrow. The London County Council also inserted another clause providing for a certain amount of supervision and control of such matters by that body, and when these clauses came before the House of Commons Committee, because there was a considerable amount of opposition to the control clause, the London County 61 Council thought fit to withdraw the whole of the clauses rather than give way on the question of their supervision and control. This attitude on the part of such a body as the London County Council is certainly to be deplored. Sanitary Authorities and the Public Health will accordingly have to wait for some future Bill before the anomalous position is put right. Food Preparation. Places where food is prepared have been visited on 156 occasions, improvements being required in 42 instances, as detailed below: — Class of Premises. Number on Lists.

Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. Thirty-two applications were received during the year for certificates under these Acts. No certificates were granted. 62 Housing of the Working Classes. Premises have been found to be overcrowded in 34 cases, which have -all been abated, and in 3 cases the illegal use of underground rooms has been discontinued. Four hundred and fifty-seven houses have been generally repaired; 342 premises have been cleansed, limewashed, and repaired ; 29 have been improved as regards their ventilation; 202 premises have had the walls and ceilings cleansed throughout, and 256 premises have been partially cleansed; leaky house roofs and gutters have been repaired in 406 cases; nuisances from dampness have been abated in 123 cases; dampness of walls have been remedied in 9 7 cases; direct connection between the internal sanitary fittings of houses and the drain have been disconnected, trapped, and amended in 23 7 cases; similarly 107 stack pipes have been disconnected, trapped and amended; 2 houses have been abolished as unfit for habitation; and other nuisances principally of dilapidations and want of underfloor ventilation have also been attended to in 13 cases. No definite proceedings have been taken either under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of the Houses of Working Classes Acts, for the closing of any properties, but in many instances our requirements under notices to abate the nuisance arising on such properties have been of such an extensive character that the owners have themselves voluntarily closed eleven houses rather than spend the money required to put them into such a condition as to comply with the notices served upon them. The Greenwich Hospital Estates Department have been carrying out considerable improvements to their property in different parts of the Borough. A portion of the site of the " Ship " Hotel having been cleared, and upon this 16 houses have been erected of a commodious type, including bath room, lavatory basin, and drying closet, which conveniences are not usually included in working- 63 class dwellings. These dwellings are let at an inclusive rental of 12s. per week. Other similar dwellings have been also erected by them in the Old Woolwich Road, bath rooms have been, and are being, provided in many of the older properties on the estate, with the idea of bringing the property up to date, and supplying a very necessary want. Notices of dilapidation have been served on other lessees on this estate, and in this way a good deal of work has been done by this body as landlords to improve their property and at the same time provide working-class dwelling accommodation. The Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, has been under consideration, but the question of definitely selecting areas for its operation was adjourned until this current year. Houses Let in Lodgings. Out of a number of such premises which have been reported to the Committee, it has been decided during 1910 to register 2 7, which together with the 68 on the register at the end of 1909, gives a total of 95 premises on the Register of Houses let in Lodgings at the end of the year. The difficulty connected with the By-laws for regulating these premises having at last been settled between the Local Government Board and this Council, a new series have been drawn up, adopted, and approved by the Local Government Board, and towards the latter part of the year a lady Sanitary Inspector was appointed, one of whose duties being to specially take in hand the question of registration of this class of property, and up to the present time a good deal of work has been done in this connection. 64 House Drainage. Two hundred and seventy-four house drainage systems have been reconstructed; 242 such systems have also been opened, cleansed and amended; 45 new systems and 242 surface drains have been constructed; 81 systems have been tested by smoke and 371 by water, of which number 215 were found to be defective; 73 new soil pipes and 423 traps have been fixed, together with 5 6 intercepting chambers, and 10 other chambers. One cesspool has been abolished; 53 areas, 142 yards, and 25 mews and stables .have been thoroughly drained. Twenty-five water closets and 1 urinal have been erected; a pan, trap and water supply have been furnished throughout in 160 cases, and other fittings in 297 cases, whilst the water supply has been renewed in 137 instances. The water supply for lavatory purposes has been disconnected from the drinking water system in 24 instances. Public-house urinals have been cleansed and repaired in 68 instances, whilst a water supply has been laid on or repaired at 1 such convenience, and 1 new urinal was provided. Combined Drainage. London is still without any satisfactory solution to this difficult question, and the problems that frequently arise are the occasion of increasing expenditure on behalf of the Council, which ought morally to be defrayed by the property owners themselves. I notice that there is an increasing tendency among sanitary authorities outside London to promote Bills dealing with this question, either by combination or otherwise, and it is sincerely to be hoped that at no distant date London sanitary authorities will adopt similar measures. Complaints were again occasionally received respecting the offensive emanations from the London County Council main sewer, but as the summer generally was not characterised by any great heat, these complaints were not 65 very numerous. In the early part of the year there were somewhat extensive floodings in the low-lying part of the Borough from the over-charging of the London County Council main sewer; this particularly affected premises in Anchor and Hope Lane and on the river side of Woolwich Road. Rats. The Local Government Board having issued an order with respect to the destruction of rats wherever they were found to exist in large numbers, the following letter was sent to all owners and occupiers of river-side premises, and other premises where it was thought likely there might be a number of these rodents, and in every, case the responsible persons adopted measures to materially reduce the number of rats about their premises. Dear Sir, I beg to inform you that the Local Government Board, acting under their powers relating to the prevention of epidemic diseases, have issued an order requiring the Local Authority in this district, under certain conditions, to see that measures are adopted for the destruction of rats in the district. The Public Health Committee of this Council, therefore, having had this matter under their consideration authorised me to communicate with you, desiring: — First.—That should you notice any unusual and apparently inexplicable mortality amongst the rats on, or in the neighbourhood of, your premises, to immediately communicate with me upon this point. Secondly.—To request you to take what measures you may think best for ensuring the destruction of all rats in or about your premises. If you think that this Department can be of service to you in the way of advising or assisting in this matter, 60 I shall be most happy to hear from you, and beg to assure you of our hearty co-operation. Thanking you in anticipation of your kind attention to and compliance with, this request, I am, Yours faithfully, Refuse Removal. New ash receptacles have been provided in 347 cases, and 6 complaints on this subject have been forwarded to the Surveyor for his attention. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangements entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, still continues to work very satisfactorily. Police Court proceedings were taken during the year against a Bermondsey firm for carrying offensive material through the Borough during prohibited hours, the Magistrate inflicting a fine of 25s. and costs. Public Sanitary Conveniences. The Public Sanitary Conveniences, Urinals, Fountains and Horse Troughs situated within the Borough are the same as last year, with the exception of the Horse Trough, Woolwich Road, which had to be removed when the tramway system along that thoroughfare was electrified. The question of provision of further accommodation in the way of public sanitary conveniences has been before the Committee on many occasions. The subject having been reported upon both by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and myself, various sites were pointed out where these conveniences might be erected, but during the year nothing definite was done in this matter. During this current year, however, an above-ground urinal of the Chalet type is being erected near the junction of Blackheath Hill and Lewisham Road, on the site of the old underground convenience which existed for many years at this spot. 67 Water Supply. The water supplied throughout the whole of the District by the Metropolitan Water Board still maintains its high standard of purity. During the year 84 water supply certificates have been granted under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; these certificates stating that the new houses to which they refer are supplied with a proper water supply in accordance with the. Act. Defective water fittings have been renewed in 104 cases; 23 water supplies have been reinstated where the supply had been cut off; 5 8 water supplies have been altered so as to draw direct from the main; the cleansing, repairing, and covering of cisterns has been required in 35 cases. Smoke Nuisances. Two hundred and sixty-seven observation? have been taken for smoke nuisances during the year but on only 15 occasions was it found necessary to issue Statutory Notices for the abatement of any nuisance which was found. One prosecution has been taken during the year on this account, the Magistrate granting a prohibition order, and 21s. costs. Food and Drugs Act. Four hundred samples have been purchased under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which 381 were certified to be genuine and 19 adulterated, the adulterations thus being equivalent to about 5 per cent of the samples taken. Of the total number of samples purchased, 12 7 were butter, of which 3 were adulterated; 189 were milk, of which 13 were certified to be adulterated; the remaining adulterated samples were 1 of separated milk, 1 skimmed milk, and 1 coffee. 68 Proceedings were taken in 17 of these cases, in two other cases proceedings were not taken because of certain technical difficulties with respect to the service of the summons upon the proper person. These proceedings resulted in fines and costs being imposed in 8 cases, in 2 cases warranties were established to the satisfaction of the Court. The remaining 2 summonses were not served, as the defendant had gone away and left no proper address, and 5 cases were dismissed. Defendants in each of these latter cases producing expert evidence to rebut the presumption raised under the Board of Agriculture's milk regulations, that the milk, although in each case below the standard therein specified, yet was delivered as it was produced by the cow. The evidence tendered in this way was of a very general character, however, showing that at this 'season of the year, and particularly in this neighbourhood on the boundaries of Kent and Sussex, cows were not giving milk up to the standard set out in. these regulations. These cases seem to show how difficult the position of the small milk retailer is, because if farmers are thus allowed to supply milk below the standard, and yet can get off when proceedings are taken against them, how can the retailer be able to supply milk up to the standard, and he seldom is able to produce a warranty from the wholesale firm, they, generally speaking, being very loth to take this responsibility. A point has arisen during the year as to whether or no it is necessary under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Regulations, for a person who sells only separated milk to be registered under these regulations. As far as can be seen no such requirement is necessary, and, accordingly, premises may be used for this purpose which are entirely unsuitable; fortunately the number of enquiries and inspections that were made of the premises 69 concerned was sufficiently discouraging to the person, and he did not continue his operations in this Borough. In any future legislation on the subject of milk and milk products it would be advisable that attention should be drawn to this matter. One of the warranties which was proved in one of the cases was of a somewhat peculiar character, having apparently been drawn up specially to provide for any possible prosecution under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, but to have no validity for any other purpose, being somewhat as follows:— "The Purchaser hereby agrees to buy and the Vendor agrees to sell from March, 1910, to April, 1911, but without accepting any responsibility after delivery, the whole of the supply of milk required in the Purchaser's business. The milk to be pure and unskimmed as from the cow, and free from preservatives." Of the total number of samples, 27 were taken in course of, and at the place of delivery, by an Officer of this Council direct, of which number 7 were certified to be adulterated; 20 were bought by an Officer of the Council direct, 1 of which was adulterated; the remaining 353 samples were taken by agents employed by the Officers of this Council, and a small number of samples not included in the above were taken in an informal manner. 70 The following Statement showing the number of samples of all kinds of Food and Drugs, and the number of samples of Milk and Butter examined in 1909, by the Public Analyst of each Local Authority under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in London, is interesting:— Borough.
