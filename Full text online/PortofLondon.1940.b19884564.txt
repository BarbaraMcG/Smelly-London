Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Circular No.2288 of the Ministry of Health dated 5th February, 1941 requests that the Report for the current year be prepared on the lines indicated in Circular No.1937 dated 11th January, 1940, namely that "having regard to the desirability of reducing the number of records to be kept and of avoiding as far as possible the disclosure of information relating to the movement of ships, the Minister desires that the requirements set out in Memo.204/S.A. shall be modified during the period of emergency: the letterpress of the report should consist of short notes on any points of special interest." During the year 564 vessels were boarded and inspected by your Medical Officers and 8,173 by your Inspectors. Infectious Disease was reported as having occurred during the voyage on 122 vessels, the total number of cases being 230, of which 90 were landed in the Port. Sixty-one cases, particulars of which are given in Appendix II, were either admitted to your Hospital at Denton or disposed of in other Infectious Diseases Hospitals. It was decided, for various reasons, temporarily to close the Port Isolation Hospital at Denton. The last patient was discharged on the 24.9.40. and from the 26.10.40. the Hospital has been placed on a care and maintenance basis. Arrangements were made for the reception of cases of infectious disease in Hospitals in the vicinity of the River. Denton Hospital can be re-opened at short notice should the occasion arise. Disinfection of cases, their clothing, bedding and effects continue to be carried out at Denton Hospital. No case of human plague occurred during the year on any vessel bound for London. Of the 2,076 rats examined bacteriologically, 921 were from ships and 1,155 were from shore premises. No rats were reported to be infected with Plague. One hundred and seventeen vessels were fumigated for rat destruction under the supervision of your Inspectors; 66 by sulphur dioxide resulting in the destruction of 2,239 rats and 392 mice; 51 by hydrogen cyanide accounting for 758 rats and 101 mice. One vessel was deratised by Trapping only, the number of rats so destroyed being 26. 5. In addition 5,115 rats were trapped in ships and 4,157 on shore premises in the Port. The Parrots (prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, continued in operation and the work thereunder is reported on page 9. The arrangements whereby the registration of Water Barges was made conditional upon the report of your Officers as to their fitness for the carriage of drinking water, continued to work smoothly. During the year 4,463 tons of foodstuff were condemned as unfit for human consumption and were either destroyed or disposed of for animal feeding or industrial purposes under suitable guarantee. Particular attention has been paid to the salvage of damaged foodstuffs and their reconditioning where possible, to render them fit, either for human consumption or for animal consumption or for industrial purposes. Your Medical Officer is pleased to report that many hundreds of tons of foodstuffs have been saved and he wishes to take this opportunity of thanking the Officers of the various Government Departments, of the Port of London Authority and of private firms for the valuable collaboration that made this possible. He also wishes to thank the Officers of His Majesty's Customs, port of London Authority, the Pilots and the members of the Staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants for their invaluable collaboration and help in every aspect of the work of the Port of London Health Authority throughout the year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant M.T.MORGAN. 6. I.-AMOUNT OF SHIPPING ENTERING THE PORT DURING THE YEAR 1940 Table A.
