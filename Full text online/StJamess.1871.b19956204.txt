ALFRED ELFORD, General Report of Marks executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1871-72. . ' 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1872. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, It becomes my duty once more, having the honour still to act as your Surveyor, to present a short summary of the principal matters that have been executed during the twelve months ending the 25th March, 1872. As the Vestry pays considerable attention to all the matters connected with the execution of Works under its control, and the Works and Improvements Committee especially enter into the minutest details both as to the necessity for, and cost of, all Works done with their sanction, or by their order—it follows that the Vestry is almost as conversant with the particulars of matters done under their authority, as the Officer under whose immediate superintendence the matters are carried out. A very short report or summary will therefore answer the purpose required by the Act of Parliament, to collect together the principal items that require to be recorded. A detailed report of all the works done would fill a volume, and answer no useful purpose whatever, though they are, in themselves, of the utmost importance, such as openings made in the roads by the Public Companies, &c. 14 I am happy to be able to state, generally, that nothing has occurred, during the twelve months in question, in the shape of accident; I do not merely mean to life and limb, but no unforeseen circumstances have involved the Vestry in litigation or dispute, or have caused their conduct or acts to be in any way unkindly criticised or blamed; but, on the whole, it appears to me that the Vestry have cause for congratulation, that the patient attention given by them and the various committees has been rewarded by the Parish, (both as to Drainage and Paving) being, if not exactly a model, certainly second to none in the Metropolis, and I most unhesitatingly assert, that this is in the face of great difficulties, as the street traffic is about the worst to contend against, and to maintain the roads for, in London, or, I believe, the world, and the local sewerage is likewise both incessant and abundant. Small as the Parish is, there are, at, least, fourteen miles of roads and sewers to be seen to. The quantity of gully-drains I have never calculated (there are about 330 gullies), but from the extremely complicated nature of everything underground in the Parish, there would be very nearly, if not quite, as much more, to say nothing of the apparently meaningless way in which numbers of them are constructed, apparently with no other view than to be as inefficient as possible, at present, and to baffle future generations. But the actual outlay that would be required to rectify the present defects, following 15 them through all their ramifications, would be so large as to become almost impracticable. The best efforts of the Officers however have been given to all the matters in question. The main features of the Paving Works have consisted in the alteration of the Paving in Sackville Street and Duke Street, where the previous Pitched Paving has been removed, and McAdam substituted. Apart from the question of cost, which is an open one, the actual result is evidently and admittedly a success. The Pitched paving stones have been since then re-used in various places (as the accompanying lists will shew) with considerable advantage to the Parish, although the original programme for the year's Paving Works had to be departed from. But little can be said that will throw any additional light on the Works that have been done, as they are all fully described, either by the Vestry or the Works and Improvements Committee, both before, after, and during their execution; so that there are, at least, a considerable number of Vestrymen who can at any time, themselves, as is shown at every Vestry Meeting, explain the minutest details of the various matters with which they have been called upon to deal. The Vestry, and London generally, has, however, a cause of great congratulation in the introduction of the Wood Paving, now being laid in Gracechurch Street, and which will be found to result in a complete success, as it consists more in principle of 16 construction than in mere material. Great ability and foresight have been shown in perfecting the scheme, and I shall be very much mistaken if it does not prove to be a solution of the difficulties of maintaining many important thoroughfares. The only drawback that first struck practical men was the difficulty that would result in connection with openings. I find that those difficulties would not be nearly so great as were anticipated. And I think it would not be out of place to suggest that some limit should be put upon the openings themselves, as I am personally convinced many of them are to answer a very trivial end. As the Vestry have decided to study carefully the different kinds of new Paving now being tested in London, it would be almost indelicate to attempt to bias any judgment in the matter; but, speaking as an individual, I am sure that a close study of the method of making and maintaining the Pavement in question, will go far to enlighten those who do it, on this most difficult subject. We know the durability of Wood, and when it is laid in the skilful manner as is now being done, it amounts almost to a guarantee of perfection. I hope that before another year has passed, there will be some specimens in St. James's. Having so recently specially reported on Asphalte, and the Vestry having carefully considered that subject, it need not be re-opened here. The largest matter in Sewers Works has been 17 the re-construction of the Sewer in Little Windmill Street, which has been entirely rebuilt in a sound, substantial, and lasting manner. It appears, naturally, to have been a pity that this was not done at first, or when the Sewer was originally built, but it must not be forgotten, that even in such matters as constructing Sewers, there are, so to speak, epochs of "fashion," and there was, for a short time, a prevalent fashion for small, slightly-constructed Sewers, of which the Little Windmill Street Sewer was one, but will not be the only one that will be a trouble and expense. The soil in which it was constructed did not admit of experiments the result of which could be doubtful. Although the cost is large, there is some satisfaction in the work being completed without accident or litigation, which, considering the very fragile nature of some of the buildings, the great depth of the Sewer, and its contiguity to the buildings, combined with the quantity of water to be contended against, rendered the carrying out such a work no easy or ordinary matter. Great credit is due to Messrs. Thirst, the Contractors, for the workmanlike manner in which all was done. Had there been any defects in the work they would have probably appeared before now The list also shews a considerable amount expended in repairing, or in other words, "maintaining" the local Sewers. Some of them are very old and dilapidated. The mere fact of age would not be of b 18 much importance, if they had ever been properly constructed; but, unfortunately, the nature of drainage works generally admits of a considerable amount of indifferent work being introduced, unless great care is exercised, and although many men always did and always will conscientiously do what is right, there are, perhaps, more who will not, and Sewers and Drains being out of sight, admit of a great amount of "scamping" work; and, speaking from experience, some of the local Sewers in St. James's, are specimens, I hope unique, of the extent to which "scamping" can be carried. If it is not bad workmanship and materials that has caused many of them to require constant attention, it is a most extraordinary case of error of judgment. The mistaken idea of putting 12-inch pipes in the wrong places, is another cause of constant anxiety and expense. Glazed pipes, when properly laid, are most efficient; but very few know how they should be done, or are acquainted with the great cost attending a system of pipe Sewerage, and consequently the pipes have been recklessly laid, under the idea of economy, and are a continual source of outlay and trouble. Nothing can be a more clear example of the want of thought than to select mews and stable yards, where dung and straw accumulate, to put pipes, which are, of course, inaccessible, without any kind of provision to intercept the said materials from completely choking them. Of course, the success, 19 in many instances, is complete, as we find the pipes most completely filled, as if it had been done on purpose, or by some intelligent agency. How it is they keep clear as long as they do, is a mystery; but, somehow or other, they do, and as the expense of replacing them would be simply enormous, I suppose the best must be made of a bad job, till they will be gradually changed to something better. Another source of responsibility which occasionally occurs, is having to remedy the mistakes of predecessors. It happens, as it appears to me, more frequently than it should, that in constructing or reconstructing Sewers, House and Gully Drains get forgotten to be connected. The annexed list shews the sum of about £39 expended in twelve months, in this manner, and there has been more expended since. The time that elapses between the drain being cut off, and the discovery, is accounted for by the excavation that is made for a Sewer, which will allow of accumulations being deposited for years, but at last all available spaces being filled, and the ground saturated, the fact of no outlet becomes patent, and after much trouble and investigation, it is discovered that there is no outlet at all. The burden of putting this straight rests with the local authorities, as it should have been done at the time the original work was done, and at the expense of the then authorities. literally nothing has been done in the matter of Public "Halting Places," but the subject has been 20 so ventilated and discussed, that being naturally unpleasant, I have no doubt that the Vestry are as tired of hearing the old questions, as I am. Still I trust that in time the matter will meet with the attention that it deserves, as however unpopular the subject, it deals with an actual necessity, and I am surprised sometimes at the apparent apathy of the medical profession on the point. The other few matters in the list do not involve any special notice; although the Vestry are perhaps hardly aware that very often much more skill and attention is required to spend a small, than a large amount of money, in fact this is the rule in building matters; and if any difficulty can be overcome without spending any money at all, it is a kind of complete success, but as such an event cannot appear in any chronicle whatever, it naturally follows that a great deal of care, ability, and attention, though not thrown away in fact, are at least lost sight of, and it is the constant care of those officers of the Vestry connected with the execution of the public works to see that the same are as economically as well as efficiently executed. Thanking the Vestry again for the continued confidence of another twelve months, and trusting to continue to deserve the same. I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir, my Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, ALBERT P. HOWELL. 21 GENERAL WORKS, &c., EXECUTED BY The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March, 1871, to 25th March, 1872.

MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. T0 THE VESTRY of The Parish of St. James's, Westminster. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the tables of mortality, with an account of the sanitary work done in the Parish, under my direction, during the year 1871. I shall, as usual, make some remarks on these documents, and refer generally to the present sanitary condition, and compare it with the condition of the Parish in past years. The General Mortality of the Parish in 1871. By reference to the Table of the Causes of Death in the Parish for the four quarters of the year 1871, it will be seen that the total death rate given in these tables is seven hundred and twenty-one. Although all the persons enumerated have died in this Parish, the whole of them cannot be regarded as having been affected by causes of death originating in Saint James's, Westminster. The reason of this is that a certain number of paupers who have been liable to 30 the Parish of St. Anne, Soho, have been sent to the Workhouse of Saint James, Westminster, and have died there. The number of persons brought from Saint Anne's, Soho, is forty-one. Of these, twenty-three were persons above fifty years of age; sixteen were above one year and under fifty; whilst only two were infants under one year of age. Deaths in Saint James's, Westminster - 721 ,, from Saint Anne's, Soho, in Workhouse 41 Real Deaths in Saint James's, 680 This is very gratifying, as it thus enables me to state that the death rate of 1871, was less than in any year since 1858. 1856 682 1864 832 1857 712 1865 704 1858 669 1866 769 1859 764 1867 707 1860 723 1868 684 1861 758 1869 719 1862 727 1870 824 1863 757 1871 680 It will be seen from this table that there died in the Parish of Saint James, in sixteen years, 11,711 persons, or, on an average, seven hundred and thirty persons every year. It thus appears that the death rate of the year 1871 was fifty below the average of the last sixteen years. 31 The distribution of deaths in the four quarters of the year, and in the three districts of the Parish, will be seen for the last three years in the following: Table of Deaths in Districts and Quarters. 1869.

A comparison of these tables is interesting, as showing that the principal differences in the death rates of the three years have been in the second quarter. Whilst in the second quarter, 1869, 207 persons died; in 1870, in the same quarter, 241 persons died; and in 1871 there were 174 deaths. The difference in the death rates is principally due to the prevalence of diseases of the chest, and these are, more than any other class of disease, dependent on cold. When the temperature of the quarter is below the average, the diseases of the chest are above the average. When the temperature is above the average, then the death rate of these diseases diminishes. I have before pointed out the vast influence which temperature exercises over the death rate of our population. There is no better way of meeting this condition than by warm clothing. Unhappily the practice of the poor in the overcrowded dwellings of Saint James's, is to protect themselves from cold by excluding the fresh air, and thus by protecting themselves from one enemy, they invite another even more deadly than the one they have excluded. I now invite your attention to a series of tables by which one may discover the fluctuation of our death rates according to age. 33 Ages of Death in Quarters. 1869. Under 1 Year. Above 1 and under 5.

The only group of ages in which there was an excess of death is in the lives above the age of forty. Death in the Workhouse. In estimating the death rate of the different districts of the Parish, it becomes important to separate the deaths in the Workhouse and others for two reasons: first, that it contains residents 35 from other Parishes than Saint James's, Westminster; and, second, that it is situate in one district of the Parish, and receives inmates from all three. It is probable, though I have no data to prove it, that the deaths in the Workhouse are greater from Berwick Street than from the two other districts of the Parish. In calculating the death rate of the districts I have always distributed the deaths in the Workhouse over the three districts equally. The following table gives the deaths in the Workhouse for the last ten years : 1862 135 1863 159 1864 178 1865 129 1866 132 1867 136 1868 145 1869 142 1870 143 1871 80 The following are the deaths of persons, brought from St. Anne's Parish, in 1869 41 1870 38 1871 41 The population of a Workhouse is subject to great fluctuations at all times dependent on the prosperity, health, and other circumstances of a district. The 36 statistics of the mortality of our Workhouses have also been greatly interfered with by changes in local administration and the erection of common hospitals and infirmaries for the various parishes of London. At any rate, the inference we may draw from the above table is, that there has been a gradual diminution of deaths in the Workhouse since 1864, and that there was less death amongst the Saint James's paupers in 1871, than any year during the last ten years. The curious part is the equality of the number of deaths of paupers for Saint Anne's, Soho, during the three years of which they have been inmates of Saint James's Workhouse. Zymotic Diseases in 1871. I have always regarded the prevalance or absence of these diseases as one of the great tests of the salubrity of a situation or a season. At the same time, a district in a town is not always capable of defending itself from the attack of these insidious complaints, on account of the carelessness or dirtiness of their neighbours. It has been one of the great faults of our sanitary arrangement and legislation for London, that the metropolis has not been regarded as a whole, and that, through the ignorance or carelessness of one district or local board, the whole of the others may be put in peril. At the same time, defective as are our laws, displaying alike ignorance of the nature of Zymotic diseases, and the means of preventing them, much good may be 37 done by the intelligent application of a few known principles, by local bodies anxious to preserve the health and lives of their constituents. I now present you with a table of deaths from the various forms of Zymotic disease in this Parish for the last seventeen years. Table of Zymotic Disease for 17 Years. Name of Disease. 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 Small Pox 3 5 .. • • 4 4 1 1 21 .. 2 1 3 2 .. 3 18 Measles 7 5 13 10 38 8 17 9 24 29 17 19 17 11 14 13 6 Scarlet Fever and Dipth. 27 16 13 29 31 16 32 66 31 13 20 30 9 31 39 75 14 Whpg.

Thus the death of 1871 is less by ten than the average. Diarrhœa. The deaths from this disease demand our first attention, because they were larger in 1871 than in any year during the whole of the seventeen years. In 1866, when Cholera prevailed, there were but nineteen cases of death from Diarrhoea, whilst in 1870 and in 1871 there were respectively twenty-six and twenty-eight cases. One might pass over this circumstance as only one of many instances in which Zymotic diseases prevail more one year than another, depending on weather or other general causes. There is, however, this kind of relationship between Diarrhoea and Cholera, that where the former is most prevalent, there the latter is most liable to occur. That renders it very necessary that a watchful eye should be kept on the occurrence of Diarrhœa. Although no cases of Cholera have yet been announced as occurring in the British Islands, it should not be forgotten that, for the fifth time, it is travelling towards our shores ; and that at any moment a case of Asiatic Cholera may occur in our sea-ports. Small Pox. Although the mortality from this disease was less for 1871 than for either Hooping Cough or Diarrhœa, 39 and the mortality was absolutely less in the Parish in 1871 than in 1863, it nevertheless demands attention, as Small Pox is a disease which is actually under the control of human agency, and which ought not to be allowed to exist in civilized communities. The epidemic of this disease, which commenced in London in the Summer of 1870 and reached its height in the Autumn of 1871, and is only now slowly declining (July, 1872), is one of the most alarming that has visited Great Britain daring the present century, in fact since the introduction of vaccination. The deaths from Small Pox in London during the year 1871 amounted to 7,850. Besides these, there died in various towns of Great Britain 5,326 persons, making altogether 13,174 deaths. In Saint James's, Westminster, eighteen persons died in the Parish. This does not, however, include all the mortality that arose from cases of Small Pox amongst the inhabitants of Saint James's, Westminster, as many were removed to the hospitals and died there. The whole death of persons who had lived in the Parish being thirty-three, fifteen having died in hospitals. Thus it will be seen whilst the deaths from Small Pox in London was one in 414 of the population; it was only one in 1,000 in the Parish of Saint James, Westminster. This may certainly be regarded a very favourable result, for although St. James's, Westminster, is the richest Parish in London, it should not be forgotten, whilst condemning the prevalence of Zymotic disease, that 40 the Berwick Street district of the Parish is the most thickly populated in London. The following table gives an analysis of the causes of Small Pox and their results in 1871: Number of cases 230 Reported as vaccinated 210 Unvaccinated 15 Doubtful 5 Re-vaccinated 3 Total Deaths 33 Deaths of unvaccinated 8 Deaths of vaccinated 25 These figures show, most incontestably, the benefit of vaccination; for whilst more than half of those who were unvaccinated, died, only one in eight of those who were vaccinated, died. I would here remark, that it is very difficult, frequently, to ascertain whether a person has been vaccinated, after Small Pox has broken out, and the reports of patients and friends are not always wholly to be relied on. Although we should be careful in drawing conclusions from the result of a small number of cases, I would refer you to the report of the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, just issued, with regard to the cases of Small Pox treated in their several hospitals during the Small Pox epidemic of 1870-1-2. This report, which contains a series of tables embracing a most complete analysis of all the cases 41 of Small Pox occurring in the District Hospitals, affords a most triumphant confirmation of the value of vaccination as a means of preventing death from Small Pox. Table No. 3 shows at decennial groups of ages the decreasing rate of mortality according to the number of vaccination marks, whether good or bad, as exemplified in 5,539 cases treated in the Hampstead Hospital and the Stockwell Small Pox Hospital. The importance of this Table is obvious, for it will be seen that the percentage of deaths which, in the whole of the unvaccinated cases was 55.9, decreased from 15.2 in cases with one mark, to 5.5 in cases with five or more marks. Table 4 shows the comparative results in unvaccinated cases, in cases which have been badly, and in cases which have been well vaccinated, distinguishing those under from those above 15 years of age, as taken from 3,085 cases treated in the Homerton Fever and the Stockwell Small Pox Hospitals. This Table shows that the mortality, which in unvaccinated cases was no less than 47.5 per cent., and in badly vaccinated cases 25 per cent., varied in well vaccinated cases from 5.3 in those showing one good mark, to 1.1 in those showing four or more good marks; and that of the total of 420 well vaccinated cases under 15 years of age, the death-rate was only 0.47 per cent., giving a comparative immunity from fatal results. Next, as to the additional cost imposed upon the ratepayers in consequence of non-vaccination and the imperfect manner in which vaccination is often performed. The average duration of treatment of a well vaccinated case is about 21 days. Up to the 30th of March last, 14,400 eases were treated, of which 9,700 died, and 11,700 remained under treatment until complete recovery. If all these had been properly vaccinated, the duration of their stay in hospital should have been about 245,400 days, but the actual number of days charged to the Parishes and Unions for these 11,700 cases (allowance having been made for the 2,700 deaths) has been 378,700, or 133,300 days more than 42 would probably have been the case had all been well vaccinated; which, as the average cost per Patient for maintenance has been 1s. 4¾d. per day, represents an extra charge of upwards of £9,300 for maintenance alone, exclusive of the proportionate additional expenditure incurred for the salaries and maintenance of Officers, and the other establishment charges of the hospitals. Again, as the average rate of mortality in well vaccinated cases is only about four per cent. the deaths would probably have been under 600 instead of 2,700, and thus 2,100 lives might have been saved. The necessity of re-vaccination when the protective power of the primary vaccination has to a great extent passed away, cannot be too strongly urged. No greater argument to prove the efficacy of this precaution can be adduced than the fact that out of upwards of 14,800 cases received into the hospitals, only four well authenticated cases were treated in which re-vaccination had been properly performed, and these were light attacks. Further conclusive evidence is afforded by the fact that all the Nurses and Servants of the hospitals, to the number at one time of upwards of 300, who are hourly brought into the most intimate contact with the disease, who constantly breathe its atmosphere, and than whom none can be more exposed to its contagion, have, with but few exceptions, enjoyed complete immunity from its attacks. I am glad to be able to quote the above passages as to the economy attendant upon the prevention in the community of a dangerous disease like Small Pox. I would also add that whatever is true of Small Pox is true of all other catching diseases, and that the greatest extravagance of which a Government or a Public body can be guilty is to be economical in sanitary measures. I am not yet in a position to give the whole 43 history of the epidemic in our Parish, as cases are still occurring (July, 1872). We had 63 cases in 1870 and three deaths; in the present year 67 cases and nine deaths. The very favourable returns which I have laid before you, compared with the rest of London, may I think be mainly attributable to the activity you have displayed in carrying out the recommendations I made early in the year, (the 1.6th of February.) "The great means of arresting Small Pox are these 1 Vaccination: 2. Isolation: 3. Disinfection." " With regard to the first, Vaccination, I would urge upon you, whether assisted by surrounding Parishes or not, the adoption of a system of house to house visitation, so that all unvaccinated children or persons should be at once vaccinated. I also think it desirable that all persons who have been vaccinated seven years should be re-vaccinated." "With regard to Isolation, I urge upon you, at any expense, to provide the means of removing cases of Small Pox to properly constructed hospitals. You cannot compel all people to go to these refuges, but you should have them ready so that there can be no reasonable excuse for delay." "With regard to disinfecting, I have now urged upon you for the last two months the necessity of providing a disinfecting apparatus, that should at once be efficient and capacious enough to disinfect the clothing and bedding of infected families. At 44 the present moment we have no less than nine cases where infected clothing remains as centres of infection, without onr being able to employ the disinfecting apparatus, for want of sufficient accommodation. The matter is very serious, not only involving the lives and health of the inhabitants, but the business interests of the population with regard to the reputation for salubrity of commercial establishments in the Parish." These recommendations were, I believe, thoroughly carried out. Under the direction of the Board of Guardians unvaccinated children were looked up, and a thorough system of vaccinating new-born children, carried out. The practice of re-vaccination has been also extensively had recourse to. It will be seen that out of 230 people attacked, 130 were taken to the various hospitals receiving those attacked by Small Pox. As I have several times stated in my reports, it would be the means of stopping a large number of cases of Small Pox if isolation could be adopted at an earlier period in the history of the attack. Unfortunately in a large number of cases of Small Pox, the earliest indication given of the existence of the disease was the registration of the death in the Registrar General's Report. It frequently happened, on enquiry, that not only was the body buried, but that several of the members of the family had taken the disease. One of the most frequent causes of the refusal to make known the presence of contagious disease in 45 a household, is the fact that heads of the household are engaged in making clothes for others, which, if it were known, would ruin their business. I need not say how dangerous such a practice is, and must be a frequent source of the conveyance of the disease from houses of business to their customers. In March, 1872, a capacious and complete disinfecting apparatus having been erected in the Stone Yard, all the clothes, bed furniture, &c., of infected families were speedily. disinfected, and from that time a decline in the disease may be said to have commenced. From the time of the erecting of the disinfecting apparatus to the end of the year, 399 beds, 334 mattresses, 753 pillows, 1,630 sets of bed clothes, 1,356 sets of wearing apparel, and 1,597 miscellaneous articles were disinfected. During the year, 294 rooms were disinfected. The following hand-bill was also extensively circulated. ST, JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. SMALL POX. 1.— As this highly contagious and fatal disease now prevails in this Parish, the Inhabitants should be made aware of the danger to which they are exposed, and the best means of preventing the attack of the disease, and of stopping it where it has already broken out. II.—In the first place, it cannot be too widely known that VACCINATION is one of the best means of preventing the the attack of Small Pox. 46 III.—All persons should be re-vaccinated after 12 years of age. 1V.—When Small Pox prevails in a family or neighbourhood every person should be immediately re-vaccinated under the direction of a legally qualified medical practitioner. V.—It is required by law that every child be vaccinated within three months after its birth, and any parent or persons having charge of infants, and not having them vaccinated, are liable to prosecution and fines for the offence. VI.—When it has been ascertained that an individual has got Small Pox, everything should be done to separate the person attacked from those around. Where it is deemed desirable to remove persons thus affected to a Small Pox Hospital, information can be obtained, and the means of conveying patients ascertained, by applying to the Sanitary Inspector at the Yestry Hall, Piccadilly.* VII.—Where the persons are found to be labouring under the disease, a Medical Man should be sent for immediately. VIII.—The following directions should in all cases be carried into effect:— The room should he cleared of all needless woollen or other draperies which might possibly serve to harbour the poison. A basin, charged with chloride or carbolate of lime, or some other convenient disinfectant, should be kept constantly on the bed for the patient to spit in. A large vessel, containing water impregnated with chlorides, or with Condy's fluid, should always stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body-linen immediately on its removal from the person of the patient. Pocket handkerchiefs should not be used, and small pieces of rag employed instead for wiping the mouth and nose. Each piece, after being once used, should be immediately burnt. As of necessity, the hands of nurses become frequently soiled by the secretions, a good supply of towels and two basins—one, * For attention to, and the removal of persons in the receipt of Poor Law Belief, application should be made to the Believing Officer at the Union Workhouse, 22, Marshall Street, Golden Square. 47 taining Condy's fluid or chlorides, and another plain soap and water, should be always at hand for the immediate removal of the taint. All glasses, cups, or other vessels, used by or about the patient, should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received on their very issue from the body into vessels charged with disinfectants, and immediately conveyed away. No person should be allowed to enter the room except those who are attending upon the sick. Persons attending upon the sick should be scrupulous in cleaning their hands and disinfecting their clothes before they go out of the sickroom, or communicate with those who have not got the disease. IX.—When persons have had the Small Pox, whether they get well or die, the room in which they have been ill should be disinfected. The floor should be washed with chloride of lime and water, or carbolic acid and water. The paper should be removed by moistening with carbolic acid and water, or with Condy's fluid and water.. The room should then be fumigated by burning sulphur in an iron dish, the fireplace, crevices in windows and doors being closed by putting paper over them. The room should be exposed to the sulphur vapour for five or six hours. Or, the room may be fumigated in the same way with chlorine vapour, which is procured by pouring oil of vitriol on common salt and oxide of manganese. X.—After the room has been fumigated, it should be limewhited, and the doors and windows kept open for a week or a fortnight. By Order of the Vestry, EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. March, 1871. Medical Officer of Health. As a conclusion from the observation of the facts of the epidemic of Small Pox, I would draw your attention once more to the necessity of wider legislation for its suppression. It is impossible, with our present municipal machinery, in London, at 48 any rate, to exercise all that power which is necessary for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases. This is seen especially in Small Pox. If one parish takes precautions, and is surrounded with parishes which do not take precautions, much of the good it would do, is lost. Thus, if one parish takes the precaution to vaccinate every child, and one of the other parishes do not do the same, it is impossible to prevent the children of families from the unvaccinated districts carrying a liability to take this disease into districts where they are vaccinated. So it is with disinfection. If the parish sends disinfectants to houses where there is infectious disease, and an adjoining parish use no disinfectants, then the disease spreads from the infected to the disinfected district. The present epidemic of Small Pox is still spreading in the provinces, and may go on for a year or two longer. Should our legislators ever get to feel that disease and death are worth preventing, they may stop Small Pox by two great measures : 1. Compulsory Vaccination, carried out by officers appointed by the Crown, and quite independent of all local authorities. 2. Public declaration of the existence of Small Pox to the sanitary authorities. Heavy penalties to be attached to the neglect of this declaration, or the neglect of the sanitary authorities to take steps for the isolation and disinfection of diseased persons. 49 This last law should be applied to all infectious diseases. Such a measure, if properly carried out, would probably lead to the saving of 100,000 lives annually, and a sum of money equal to £10,000,000 sterling. Sixteen Years of Sanitary Work. At the end of sixteen years it may not be amiss to glance at the results of the sanitary work done in the parish. We have, fortunately, the means of doing this by comparison of the death rates before and after the introduction of the Metropolitan Management Act, by which the Medical Officer of Health and his duties, were constituted. In the ten years previous to 1856, the average death rate of the parish was 790. The average death rate of the parish for the past 16 years has been 700; hence it would appear that upon an average there has been sixty less deaths every year since your sanitary operations commenced. This makes nine hundred and sixty lives. If you recollect that when, by sanitary measures, you save one life, you protect twenty others from sickness, debility, and incapacity to work, you will be enabled to estimate the enormous saving to the community of this great work. I am afraid to place before you the money value that this saving of life and health has secured—it is so enormous. Yet every one must feel that human work is carried on by human life, and that the result of work is D 50 wealth. The value of human life is therefore a calculable quantity. The charges for funerals, for illnesses, for work not done, for poor's rates, all the results of disease and death, can be easily estimated. J calculate, at the very lowest, that the sum thus saved, not only to the Parish of St. James, Westminster, but to the community at large, could not be set down at a sum less than £50,000. That this saving has not been effected without a considerable amount of work, will be seen by the following table, which gives an account of some of the sanitary work done in the last 16 years.

In a report published by the Vestry in 1855, a Committee reported that the great attack of Cholera in 1854 had been entirely due to the water of a well in Broad Street. Several of the wells were found to deliver water obviously contaminated by sewage, and I pointed out the danger of using such water. I strongly advised that all these wells should be closed, and was joined in this recommendation by every Medical Officer of Health in London. The agitation thus begun has, I believe, terminated in the closure of nearly every surfacewell pump in London. In 1857 I was requested to draw up a special report, in preparation for Cholera, which was made to the Vestry on the 15th of October. The recommendations there made were more or less immediately carried out; so that when the outbreak of Cholera occurred in 1866, we were more or less prepared to meet the event, and suffered less than any other parish in London. During this year I also drew up two handbills, one containing directions for the preservation of health, and the other directions for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. These were the commencement of a series of handbills which I have drawn up at your request, and which I believe have not only done a great deal of good in St James's, Westminster, but in many other parts of the country. Some of these, as the papers on Vaccination and Scarlet Fever, have been reprinted and circulated by thousands in various towns of England. In 1858 my attention was more particularly called to the overcrowded and unhealthy condition of those Cellars and Kitchens which had been let for the occupation of poor families during that year and the two preceding ones. Sixty-two kitchens were condemned as being occupied contrary to the 103rd Section of the Metropolis Management Act. Since that time it has required constant attention to prevent these kitchens from being repopulated. The getting rid of the unhealthy population of the kitchens has, undoubtedly, been a cause of the diminished population of the Parish, and its increased salubrity. In 1859 my attention was directed to the state of the Stables, Cow Houses, and Slaughter Houses in the Parish. I pointed out that a large number of these were situated in the midst of thickly-crowded populations, and could but act, through the decomposing animal matter by which they are accompanied, injuriously on the health of the inhabitants of the houses near by. In 1860 "An Act for Preventing the Adulteration of Articles of Food or Drink," was passed. I was appointed Analyst under this Act, but without a proper laboratory for carrying out the provisions of the Act. I have, nevertheless, made extensive analyses of articles of food, such as milk, bread, 58 coffee, tea, pickles, condiments, and other things, and I believe that much good has been done by the knowledge of the fact that I was ready to undertake the analysis of any article of food that was found to be unfit for eating, or improperly adulterated. In 1861 the most especial business of the year was the Inspection of the Bakehouses of the Parish. Whilst several were found to have special defects, which were speedily corrected by the proprietors, the great majority of the bakehouses were found to be well-ventilated, clean, and free from objections on the score of the health of the persons employed. In 1862 there were evident indications of the appearance of an epidemic of Small Pox, and I was most anxious to secure a complete vaccination of the whole Parish, and the matter having been considered by your Sanitary Committee, the Sanitary Inspector was appointed to make a house to house visitation. His services were continued till 1865, when other arrangements were made for attaining this object. During his period of service, several thousand persons were examined from house to house, and I personally examined several hundreds of children in the parish schools. In 1863 the Small Pox appeared amongst us. Twenty-one persons died of the disease. The epidemic was not so severe as the one of 1871, and there were always fewer cases prevailing at a given time. In 1863 the Cow Houses, which had become a great nuisance in the Parish, were put under 54 supervision by the aid of a clause in the Amended Metropolitan Act of 1862. The Slaughter Houses were also put under surveillance through the same Act, and the Magistrates refused to license houses for slaughtering under ground. In 1864, the Sanitary Inspector was chiefly employed in carrying out a house to house visitation, for the purpose of discovering persons who were unvaccinated. Upwards of one thousand families were visited, and upwards of one hundred and forty children were found unvaccinated. During this year the largest mortality occurred of any year during the sixteen of which I have been Medical Officer of Health. I undertook to invesigate the causes, and showed in my Report that the death was due to the extreme cold of that year. I also brought before you this year the necessity of a more accurate registration of deaths, and a petition was presented to the Home Secretary on the subject. In 1865, the very evident increase of Diarrhoea and the existence of Cholera on the Continent of Europe, led to the adoption of immediate steps for meeting any outbreak of this disease in the Metropolis. A thorough inspection of the parish was made, and the various surface wells were closed. It was in this year also that I made extensive enquiries into the condition of persons in the various work-rooms where tailors and milliners were employed. This led to a large improvement in the condition of these work-rooms, as everywhere the 55 proprietors were glad to receive instructions with regard to any improvement for the benefit of their workpeople. In 1866, as had been anticipated, the Cholera came. First, an unusual amount of Diarrhoea, then true cases of Cholera. The epidemic spent its strength in the East of London; but in Saint James's, Westminster, we had eight deaths. No time was lost in taking steps to meet the disease, should it appear, and four medical men were appointed to take charge of any persons suffering from Diarrhoea and Cholera. Upwards of 1,300 cases, chiefly Diarrhoea, were attended by these gentlemen. In this year was passed the Sanitary Act, under which much greater powers were given to the local authorities to deal with nuisances injurious to health. In this Act power was given to the Vestries of London to register and supervise common Lodging Houses, and regulations were drawn up by your Officers, and having been approved by the Home Secretary, have been, to a greater or less extent, acted on ever since. It was during 1867 that the Sanitary Inspector measured the cubic space contained in the dwelling rooms of the Berwick Street District, and it was found that the district was so largely over-populated, that at least 7,000 persons must have been removed in order to give the cubic space required by the Lodging-house regulations. In 1867 an Act was passed entitled the "Workshop 56 Regulation Act," and in 1868 it was introduced into St. James's, Westminster. An abstract of this Act was prepared and signed by the Vestry Clerk, and 6,000 copies circulated throughout the parish. This immediately led to extensive improvements in the condition of workrooms, and in no case have I found it necessary to order prosecution for the infringement of its requirements. In 1869 there was a decided tendency to the development of Zymotic disease, as shown by 119 deaths as against 88 of the two previous years. This led to the publication and circulation of handbills on Scarlet Fever and Typhoid Fever. I became also convinced that at any time another epidemic of Small Pox might cover the land. At your suggestion I drew up the handbill entitled "Facts and Reasons in favour of Vaccination and the Vaccination Laws." This handbill has been reprinted in many towns in England, and although it has not prevented the spread of Small Pox amongst us this year, I still hope it may have induced an attention to the subject of Vaccination, and thus have spared not a few lives during the epidemic. I also drew up, at your request, a handbill " On the Legal means of preventing Infectious and Catching Diseases." In this bill attention was called to the penalties incurred for exposing persons suffering from infectious disease, in public conveyances. The year 1870 was chiefly remarkable for the 57 prevalence of Zymotic Disease. Seventy-nine persons died of Scarlet Fever, and twenty-six of Diarrhoea. Nearly all these cases were individually dealt with, and means taken to prevent their further spread. Amongst the poor, disinfectants were distributed and personal aid was given wherever infectious diseases prevailed. The record of 1871 is in the present report. I have thus endeavoured to sketch what has been done for the last sixteen years, in the hope that it may encourage you to proceed in a course which has so amply repaid the cost it has demanded. Much remains to be done in the parish, and with the doing that, the same rewards will follow. The money saved must, with all, be regarded as a sufficient justification of your sanitary work; but when we consider the suffering prevented, the agony saved, and the life now happy which must have been lost, we must feel that the power of preventing death and disease is one of the most blessed gifts put into the hands of man by a beneficient Providence, to exercise for the benefit of his fellow creatures. I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. APPENDIX CONTAINING PAGE 1. Table of Causes of Death 60 2.
