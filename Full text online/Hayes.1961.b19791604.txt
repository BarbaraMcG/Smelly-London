To the Chairman and Members of the Council. Mr. Chairman, Councillor Mrs. Johnson and Gentlemen, 1961 was a census year and it will be seen that the provisional population figures agree reasonably well with the Registrar General's estimate. The census figures show an increase of 3. 5% over those for 1951. The Registrar General's estimate of population shows a small decrease from the previous year. The birth rate and death rate have both increased, but the infant death rates are all lower. The perinatal mortality rate has decreased from 37.9 to 24,4 and the stillbirth rate is the lowest to date, a trend which I hope will continue. At the end of April the mass radiography unit paid a visit to the district. All the public sessions were held without prior appointments and the unit was stationed at 5 points in the district. In addition certain firms in the district were visited and the numbers attending each station are given below:- Belmore Parade, Uxbridge Road 1,286 Poplar Parade, Yeading Lane 472 Manor Parade, High Street, Harlington 499 Kingshill Avenue 431 East Avenue 1,559 At various firms 2,455 Total 6,702 The total, about 10% of the population, seems small but the organisers of the visit appear to have been satisfied. The preliminary census report shows a reduction in the number of families per dwelling, which indicates an easing of the cramped living conditions in the district generally. However a routine question unconnected with the work of the Urban District 3 led to the discovery of previously unsuspected statutory overcrowding in the district. The first cases investigated had arisen from the natural growth of the families but later there were cases of subletting. Action is being taken to keep the situation under control and the Housing Committee is co-operating with the Public Health Committee in the matter of alternative accommodation for families which have outgrown their houses. As a corollary, steps will also be taken in 1S62 on the standards for houses let in multiple occupation. The hazards of radiation are still a topic of wide interest and certain members of the department have attended both theoretical and practical courses in radiation protection. The scope of these has been realistic and therefore useful to those who attended. Reference to other items of interest which occurred during the year will be found under the appropriate headings in the text of the report, together with details of statistics and so on. I should like to conclude by thanking the staff of the Public Health Department for their work and recording my appreciation of those members of the Council and especially of the Public Health Committee who have given me their interest and support during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Councillor Mrs, Johnson and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (census 1961) 67,912 Population (mid-year 1961), Registrar General's estimate of civilian population 67,930 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1961 30,369 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1961 £1, 291,651 Product of penny rate £5,355 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births; M F Total Legitimate 625 549 1174 Illegitimate 23 18 41 1215 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 17.9 Comparability Fact is 0.96 giving a corrected birth rate of 17.2 Birth rate for England and Wales 17.4 Illegitimate Live births expressed as a percentage of total live births 3.4 Still births: M F Total Legitimate 8 9 17 Illegitimate - - - 17 Rate per 1,000 live and still births 13.8 Total Live and Still Births: M F Total 656 576 1232 Infant Mortality (deaths under 1 year): M F Total Legitimate 13 5 18 Illegitimate 1 1 2 20 5 England & Wales Total Infant deaths per 1,000 live births 16.5 21.4 Legitimate Infant deaths per 1.000 legitimate live births 15.3 Illegitimate Infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 48.8 Neo-Natal Deaths & Mortality Rate: M F Total Neo-natal deaths (under 4 weeks) Legitimate 11 5 16 Illegitimate 1 1 2 18 Neo-natal Mortality rate (deaths under 4 weeks per 1,000 total live births) 14.8 M F Total Early Neo natal deaths (under 1 week) Legitimate 7 4 11 Illegitimate 1 1 2 13 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rates (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) 10.7 Perinatal Mortality Rate (stillbirths and deaths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and stillbirths) 24.4 Maternal Mortality (including abortion): Number of deaths 1 Rate per 1,000 total live and still births 0.08 Deaths: M F Total 316 224 540 Death rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 7.9 Comparability Factor is 1.60 giving a corrected death rate of 12.7 Death rate for England and Wales 12.0 6 BIRTH AND DEATH BATES, ETC.

HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA INCLUDING CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Infectious Diseases. Following the extremely small number of cases of measles in 1960, a correspondingly large epidemic started in January. 1961 and 1,804 cases had been notified by the end of the demic. Fortunately there were no deaths and only a small proportion of cases developed complications which required hospital treatment. Dysentery was reported from a day nursery school in January and Shigella Sonnei was isolated from 17 children and 3 staff. They were all treated successfully by their family doctors and there has been no further trouble. There is a certain amount of "winter vomiting" (so-called), a virus infection which has a rapid onset and short duration. Unfortunately it is not notifiable so that it is not possible to assess the extent of occurrence. The death of a baby from haemolytlc streptococcal infection started off a bacteriological hunt in a local maternity unit which lasted most of the year. It was found eventually that one of the staff was an intermittent carrier of the germ and necessary action was taken. Immunisation and Vaccination. It has become apparent during the last few years that the increase in foreign travel is having an effect on the spread of Smallpox to countries which have virtually forgotton its existence. At least once a year an incident occurs in which someone suspected of having Smallpox enters one of the United Kingdom ports and there ensues a great deal of fuss and trouble while contacts are traced, supervised and hastily vaccinated. Much of this could be avoided if a sufficiently large proportion of the population was vaccinated in infancy (when the effects are minimal) and re-vaccinated at intervals (when the effects are again minimal) especially if travel abroad is contemplated. At Christmas 1961 a traveller suffering from unsuspected Smallpox Passed through London Airport. This traveller was followed at short intervals by other unsuspected cases, and I hope I may be forgiven for anticipating my report for 1962 and commenting on the state of panic which then arose both locally and 10 ally. People whom I and my colleagues had been warning in vain of just such a situation demanded immediate vaccination for their children and themselves and family doctors had to arrange special vaccination sessions in the midst of coping with an influenza epidemic. I cannot be too strong in urging those working in and around the Airport to see that they and their families are adequately protected against anallpox. On pages 13 and 14 will be found figures supplied by the Area Medical Officer showing details of immunisation and vaccination procedures carried out in the district during 1961. It seems very likely that oral polio vaccine will be available in 1962 and it remains to be seen whether this method of protection proves more or less popular than injections. Protection against tetanus has proved very popular and many older children were immunised against this disease for the first time. Maternity and Child Welfare Services etc. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council and there are numerous sessions for ante-natal and post-natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services in clinic buildings, church halls, schools and the mobile clinic. Medical Examination of Council Employees. The total number of examinations carried out during 1961 was 189. Of these 51 were for Superannuation purposes alone, 40 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, 53 for Sick Pay and Superannuation and 45 for various special purposes. Water Supply. Water is supplied to the district by the Rickmansworth and Oxbridge Valley Water Company and the South West Suburban District Water Company. The supply is adequate and samples taken during the year have reached a satisfactory standard. The water in this district is hard and does not have a plumbo-solvent action, its natural fluoride content is low. There are no dwellings supplied by standpipes. but there are approximately 130 caravans in the district and these draw their water from standpipes on the various sites. Samples from these pipes have been satisfactory. 11 One house in the district is still supplied by a well. Samples from this have been variable and the occupants have been advised to boil all drinking water. There still appears to be no prospect of connecting a mains supply to this house in the immediate future. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment. There are now seven establishments registered under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. six of these are for chiropody and one for physiotherapy and all are of a satisfactory standard. 12 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION, 1961 Born in Years NUMBER OF CHILDREN IMMUNISED Diphtheria only Whooping Cough only Tetanus only Combined Diphtheria/ Whooping Cough Combined Diphtheria/ Tetanus Combined Diphtheria/ Whooping Cough/ Tetanus First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster First Booster 1960 - 1961 4 - 1 - 5 1 63 - 21 19 1081 73 1957 - 1959 6 65 4 - 42 1 1 12 32 96 96 214 1952 - 1956 15 245 3 - 88 8 30 33 46 210 28 192 1947 - 1951 11 320 3 - 39 8 8 10 19 41 18 87 TOTAL 36 630 11 - 174 18 102 55 118 366 1223 566 13 VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox Vaccination Poliomyelitis Vaccination Primary Be- Vaccination Primary Be-Vaccination 1957 1.030 327 2,295 - 1958 659 141 10. 278 3, 299 1959 865 177 8,050 11,403 1960 737 241 4,915 6.165 1961 959 245 4,504 5,795 14 TUBERCULOSIS New Cases and Mortality during the year, 1961 New Cases Mortality Age Periods Respiratory NonRespiratory Respiratory NonRespiratory M F M F M F M F Under 5 years - - - - - - - - 5-14 4 2 - - - - - - 15 - 24 2 3 - 1 - - - - 25-44 5 1 - 1 - - - - 45 - 64 14 3 - - 1 - - - 65 & over 1 - - - - 1 - - Age unknown - - - - - 3 - - TOTALS 26 9 - 2 1 4 - - 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 New Cases 51 49 45 43 35 37 Deaths 5 8 6 5 7 5 B.C.G.

Last year's difficulties arising from shortage of manual staff were resolved in the early part of the year and such essential services as rodent control, drain clearing, insect control etc. were resumed forthwith. there is a different story to tell however about inspectorial staff. A vacancy existed throughout the year until the 14th December and in consequence the standard of inspection of the District touched its lowest level for many years. It is perhaps unfortunate that with our kind of work a staff shortage representing 20% of normal manpower cannot be dealt with by reducing all our services by a similar amount. Some of our work must carry on as usual, smallpox contacts must be visited, out breaks of food poisoning and infectious diseases must be investi gated, complaints must receive attention and so on Furthermore if four inspectors are covering the ground normally done by five they spend more time travelling and more time getting background knowledge about unfamiliar jobs and therefore have less time available for actual inspectorial work. This means of course that some aspects of our work have to receive a much bigger cut than 20%. In actual practice some of our duties had to go completely by the board whilst others were carried out on a greatly reduced scale. One innovation was possible during the year. With the help of a newly acquired slide and filmstrip projector talks on food hygiene, clean air, hygiene in the home, etc. were given by the Public Health Inspectors to local organisations, groups of school leavers and food handlers. When circumstances permit, this work will be expanded. There is a vital need for more education on health matters and the Public Health Inspectors are willing and able to give it. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following headings: - I. Sanitary Administration, viz:- inspection of the district, summary of complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent con 18 trol, destruction of vermin and insect pests, disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses. II. Air Pollution, viz: smoke control areas, height of chitc neys, new furnaces, the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958, grit and dust, byelaws re new heating and cooking appliances, pollution from road vehicles, pollution from railway, measurement of atmospheric pollution, publicity, co-ordinating committee. III. Pood, viz:- milk supply, ice cream, inspection of meat and other foods, food hygiene, hawkers of food, sampling of food and drugs, food poisoning, complaints about food, inspection of food premises. IV. Housing, viz:- inspection, repair, demolition, closure, overcrowding, certificates of disrepair, improvement grants, moveable dwellings, new houses. V. Factories, Shops, Offices, etc. viz:- inspection of factories, outworkers premises, shops, offices and workplaces. VI. Miscellaneous duties, viz: - Noise Abatement, Petroleum (Regulation) Acts, 1928-36, Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951, Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, Pet Animals Act, 1951, Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956, Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 (Dealers in Old Metal), swimming pools, official searches.

Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, Scrap Metal Dealers etc. 20 Owing to staff difficulties the number of inspections by the Public Health Inspectors is more than 2,000 less than last year, which was itself the lowest since 1950, Comparing last year's figures with 1959, when the staffing position was reason ably satisfactory, the following striking differences are noted. a reduction In inspections under the Shops Act from 813 to 179, in the inspection of ice cream dealers' premises and vehicles from 259 to 142, in food shops, cafes, canteens etc. from 2,753 to 1,566, the inspection of schools from 48 to 7. and in the in spection of offices etc. from 159 to 102. Complaints. Whilst the total number of complaints received varied little from last year there were some appreciable differences on some specific matters, e.g. only 6 complaints about defective dustbins were received as compared with 103 in the previous year, complaints about vermin or insects increased to 77 as compared with 41, and complaints about rats and mice to 288 from 210. Summary of Complaints Choked and defective drains 254 Insanitary or dilapidated condition of houses or premises 93 Offensive accumulations or deposits 20 Defective dustbins 6 Vermin or insects 77 Gypsies 4 Rat and mouse infestations 288 Unsound Pood 22 Nuisances from animals 1 Overcrowding 4 Dust, smoke and noise nuisances 43 Other nuisances 42 Total 854 21 Notices Served.

Legal Proceedings. Food and Drugs Act, 1955, (i) Proceedings under the Milk and Dairies General Regulations 1959, were taken against a national dairy company for failing to ensure that a milk bottle was in a thorough state of clean liness and for selling a bottle of milk containing a piece of glass. The company pleaded guilty in both cases and was fined £10 with 8 guineas costs in the first case, and £25 with 6 guineas costs in the second case. (li) Proceedings under Section 2 for selling a mouldy meat pasty and a fairy cake containing fine hair fibres were taken against a firm of multiple bakers. The firm was found guilty and fines of £10 and £2 respectively were imposed together with 8 guineas costs to the Council. (iii) Proceedings under Section 2 were taken against a national dairy company for selling a bottle of chocolate milk drink containing a large thick felted pad of mould hyphae. A Plea of guilty was entered and a fine of £10 together with 10 guineas costs imposed. Public health Act, 1936. (iv) Proceedings were taken against a local resident for 22 wilfully obstructing one of the Public Health Inspectors in the execution of his duty by refusing him entry to his house to ascertain whether a notice to cleanse had been complied with. The case was found proved and a fine of £3 with 1 guinea costs imposed, The defendant was also requested to allow the Public Health Inspector to inspect the premises within the following seven days. This summons was the culmination of efforts spread over many years to improve conditions in this particular house. I am glad to report that soon afterwards satisfactory cleansing was carried out. Petroleum Consolidation Act, 1928, S Petroleum Mixtures Order, 1929. (v) As a result of the refusal by the occupier of a car rePair yard to permit an inspection of his premises to ascertain whether petroleum mixtures were being stored in contravention of the Act, an application was made to the Magistrates for a search warrant under Section 18. At the hearing the person concerned gave an undertaking to the Magistrates not to store petroleum mixtures until he had obtained a licence and meanwhile not to refuse admission to the Inspector at reasonable intervals. In view of this undertaking the application for a warrant was not pressed. Offensive Trades. There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on. In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage and Sewerage. The table below includes all premises in the district which are not on main drainage. It will be seen that there are now only nine premises within a reasonable distance of a sewer which still retain cesspools or pail closets. In four of these cases the owners have agreed to connect to the sewer and work is ex pected to start in the near future. In two other cases the premises concerned are likely to be affected by a road widening scheme and heavy expenditure on improvements at this stage 23 would be unwise In spite of little time having been available for this work during the past twelve months the figures in the table show a reduction of six cesspools and one pail closet as compared with last year The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging was taken up again after having been in abeyance last year owing to labour difficulties. Cesspool drainage Pail Closets A. Premises within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 7 2 B. Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension 2 2 C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available 14 8 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon 1 1 Totals 24 13 Pour small private sewage disposal plants are in use. A 50% grant is available for the conversion of pail closets to water closets and for the abolition of cesspools. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Keeping of AniBals. Byelaws under section 81 of the Public Health Act to con trol the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure etc. Rodent Control. Labour difficulties reported last year were satisfactorily 24 resolved at the beginning of the year and it was possible to give the usual free service to householders and the chargeable service to business premises. A considerable number of factories in the district now use the services of private operators but in these cases it is the Public Health Inspector's job, when making his routine inspections to make sure that treatment is being satisfactorily carried out and effective control exercised, No evidence was found to suggest that any surface infestation was caused by the migration of rats from sewers, and in view of the negative results which have been obtained in the past it was not considered worthwhile to carry out any treatment of the sewers during the year. The statistical report on rodent control is set out in Appendix II. Destruction of Vermin and Insect Pests. During the year the following treatments were carried out. - Ants 14 Bugs 7 Crickets 1 Cockroaches 1 Wasps 17 Disinfection, In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases. All library books however, which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library. Facilities for the steam disinfection of bedding are available when required at St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, but it has not been necessary to use these facilities during the year. Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses, etc. The routine inspection of these sites for rodent infestation, pollution, general nuisances and mosquitoes was carried . out on a reduced scale and remedial action taken where necessary. 25 PART II - AIR POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas. The ten year programme to bring the whole of the Urban District under Smoke Control continued according to schedule and by the end of the year the following progress had been made: - No. of Smoke Control Orders Acres No. of Dwellings Involved Other Buildings Involved Local Authority Private In operation 16 3,452 2,023 6,218 493 Confirmed but not yet in operation 2 220 45 1,889 134 Submitted for confirmation 1 128 _ 620 38 Preparatory work in progress 1 156 - 821 58 20 3 956 2,068 9,548 723 26 These areas account for 77% of the area of the district and 57% of the dwellings in the district. The detailed survey which takes place before a Smoke Control Order is submitted for confirmation has come under fire fron some authorities who regard it as an irksome and unnecess ary duty inflicted upon them to satisfy ministerial demands for statistical information. I have never attached much importance to this side of the detailed survey but, on the other hand, repurd its value from a public relations point of view as very great indeed. This visit by the smoke control assistant provides an excellent opportunity for giving information, removing doubt, and discovering possible objectors. Our continued immu nity from objections may be partly due to discovering them at this early stage and taking steps to convince them that their objections are ill-founded. (h) Height of Chimneys. Under Section 10 of the Clean Air Act 1956 plans of new industrial buildings deposited for byelaw approval must be rejected if the height of any chimney shown on the plan i6 26 sufficient to prevent smoke, grit, dust or gases from becoming prejudicial to health or a nuisance. This is the only provision in the Clean Air Act for reducing the harmful effects of gases, e.g. sulphur dioxide, emitted from chimneys. As the Section only applies where plans have to be sub mitted in accordance with building byelaws it follows that buildings which are exempt from byelaw control, e.g. new schools con structed by the County Council, are also exempt from the pro visions of this Section. The attitude of the County Council to smoke control is not particularly enlightened and in my opinion this exemption is not justified. Cases have occurred where upon rejection of plans because of the inadequate height of a chimney shown thereon, revised plans showing no reference to a chimney have been submitted. On completion of the building, however, a steel chimney of inadequate height has been provided. As chimneys of this type are not subject to building byelaws and therefore, not to Section 10 either, the local authority is unable to take any action. The Section makes no provision for requiring a higher chim ney when a furnace with innocuous flue gases, e.g. agas furnace, served by a low chimney is replaced by a different type of furnace, e.g. an oil fired furnace, with much more heavily polluted flue gases. There is a need, therefore, not only to close existing loopholes in the Section but also to widen its scope. Both objects could be achieved by relating the Section to the installation of new furnaces, notification of which to the local auth ority is already obligatory under Section 3 of the Act, rather than to the submission of plans for byelaw approval. Plans submitted for byelaw approval are passed to me by the Engineer and Surveyor for a decision on this particular point. It is usual for consultations to take place with builders or architects before plans are submitted, thus ensuring that an agreed chimney height is incorporated in the plans at the time of submission. During the year five plans were examined for this purpose and in every instance the proposals were satisfactory. 27 (c) New Furnaces. Nine notifications under Section 3 of the Clean Air Ast were received regarding the installation of new furnaces. It is interesting to note that all eicept the smallest of them were oil fired. One application for prior approval was received but the applicant was not prepared to meet the Council's requirements and the application was therefore not granted. (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. These regulations lay down the maximum period for which dark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. One contravention was observed and dealt with by a warning letter. The firm concerned undertook to install a smoke warning device. (e) Grit and Dust. No complaints were received during the year and on the whole the position is considered to be reasonably satisfactory. In one or two specific cases it is doubtful whether the require ments of Section 5 of the Act are being fully met. The Section requires the emission of dust and grit to be minimised, i.e. reduced to a practicable minimum but if the emission expressed in terms of grains per cubic meter of flue gases was small, even although with better firing methods the figure could be even further reduced, it would probably be difficult to establish a contravention of the section. (f) New Building Byelaws re Heating and Cooking Appliances. A new building byelaw, made under Section 24 of the Clean Air Act, has been in force in this district from the 1st Septem ber, 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating and cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, oil or solid smokeless fuel. (g) Pollution from Road Vehicles. Although the Council have no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases 28 which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co operative attitude is met with. (h) Pollution from Railway. The main line of the Western Region of British Railways runs through the industrial part of the district. Substantial progress has been made in the replacement of steam locomotives by diesels. (i) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution. Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. When these measuring stations were first set up it was anticipated that the level of pollution at the William Byrd School would be much less than at the other two stations, both in built up areas. This however has not proved to be the case. In an attempt to find a satisfactory explanation for these circumstances the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have been consulted. At their suggestion additional temporary measuring stations were set up at points intended to reflect the relative influence of the airport and Bath Road traffic. I Hve not yet had a report from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on their interpretation of the results but I understand that they incline to the view that Bath Road traffic is a much more important factor than had been realised, perhaps even more important than the airport, The average monthly figures for both smoke and sulphur dioxide show an improvement at every station compared with the previous year thus continuing the trend which was reported last year. 29 Monthly Averages for Sulphur Dioxide 1961 SULPHUR (parts per 100 million) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School, Lanshury Drive January 5. 2 5.7 4.9 February 3.5 4.2 3.9 March 4.0 4.4 3.6 April 3.1 3.8 3.9 May 2.3 2.7 2.2 June 1.4 2.2 2.0 July 1.0 2.0 2.0 August 1.0 2.0 2.0 September 2.0 3.0 2.0 October 2.0 3.0 2.0 November 6.0 4.0 8.0 December 4.0 4.7 9.0 Monthly Averages for Smoke 1961 SMOKE (Mg. per 100 Cubic Metres) William Byrd School, Bath Road Coldharbour Lane Grange Park School Lansbury Drive January 9,0 13.0 9.0 February 6.0 7.0 6.0 March 9.0 10.0 6.0 April 5.0 7.0 3.0 May 3.0 3.8 3.0 June 3.0 3.0 3.0 July 2.0 3.0 2.0 August 2.0 2.0 2.0 September 5.0 5.0 5.0 October 5.0 5.0 5.0 November 11.0 5.0 11.0 December 15.0 11.0 18.0 30 (j) Air Pollution and Fog. I am indebted to the Meteorological Office at London Air port for some extremely interesting figures on the incidence of fog. Readings are taken at intervals of three hours throughout the year and the density of fog: as indicated by the degree of visibility, recorded. If fog lasts for a whole day then of course it will be recorded on eight occasions, although not necessarily at the same density each time. During 1958 fog of varying density up to a visibility of 1,080 yards was recorded on 189 occasions; in 1959 the figure was 183: in 1960 76 and in 1961 - 135. A detailed study of the figures reveals a most interesting comparison between the number of occasions on which dense fog was recorded in relation to the number of occasions on which fog of any density was recorded. Taking visibility of less than 104 yards as being a dense fog we find that in 1958 the ratio between dense fogs and lighter fogs was 1:2.2; in 1959 1:1.8; in 1960 1:3.0; in 1961 1:4.2; showing a definite reduction in the tendency for light fogs to become dense. If we come further down the scale and compare very dense fogs, i.e. where visibility is less than 44 yards, the trend is even more marked. In 1958 the ratio between very dense fogs and other fogs was 1:5.5; in 1959 - 1:5.8; in 1960 - 1:11.7 and in 1961 1:15.0. These figures give substance to one of the main arguments in favour of smoke control, i.e. that a smoke free atmosphere will prevent light mists and light fogs from developing into dense impenetrable fogs. Once it can be established that this is in fact happening then any question of the cost of smoke control being a burden would be completely ruled out. Apart from benefit to health and savings on the cost of domestic clean sing the annual savings achieved by eliminating dense fogs would be far in excess of the cost of the contributions which the Council make towards the adaptation of fireplaces. Incidentally the Ministry of Aviation and the operating companies at London Airport must be amongst the main beneficiaries in this respect and one wonders whether, as these savings have been achieved by the efforts of local authorities in close proximity to the airport, we could not expect that some of these savings could be ploughed back to reduce the noise nuisance which the same people inflict on residents of the district. 31 (k) Publicity. More than 10,000 leaflets were distributed In proposed and actual Smoke Control Areas, These leaflets are supplied free of charge by the Ministry, the Coal Utilisation Council, Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, the North Thames Gas Board and the Southern Electricity Board. (1) South Vest Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee. The Committee met three times during the year. Interesting discussions took place on many aspects of smoke control, but it cannot be claimed that the original aims of the Committee are being attained. This aspect of the Committee's activities was discussed at the June meeting and it was decided that the Committee should continue in existence for at least a further twelve months on the same lines as hitherto. 32 PART III - FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are:- Milk Distributors 22 Dairies 4 An Order made under Section 37 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is compulsory, is in force, Owing to staff shortages it was not possible to take any samples of milk for bacteriological examination. Thirty nine samples were taken by the officers of the County Council and all were found to be satisfactory. Two licences were issued by the County Council in respect of the use of the special designation "Pasteurised" for milk processed within the district. Twenty samples of raw milk were taken in the district by officers of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli; all gave negative results. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream, Fifteen premises are registered for the manufacture of ice cream but only two of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further lie premises are registered for the sale of ice cream; inthe majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. The methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are used by both manufacturers in the district. 33 Thirty nine samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing for bacteriological examination. The use of the special standard devised by the Public Health Laboratory; Ealing has been continued and is. for convenience, set out below. Grade Count Faecal Coli I Below 500 Nil II 500 - 10,000 Nil III 10,000 - 100,000 Nil IV over 100,000 or present The grading of samples taken was as follows:- Grade I 15 or 38. 5% Grade II 15 or 38. 5% Grade III Nil Grade IV 9 or 23.0% These results are not quite as good as in 1960. The proportion of samples falling in Grades I and II was 77.0% compared with 81.25% in the previous year and 70% the year before, but on the very high standard by which these samples are graded this can be regarded as satisfactory. In sampling, attention has been concentrated on manufacturers whose products have been found to be of Inconsistent bacteriological quality. In fact five of the Grade IV samples were provided by one manufacturer and three by another All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. Ihe Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. By Orders (B.I. Nos. 2154 and 2155 - 1960) made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under the Slaughter bouse Reports (Appointed Day) Order, 1959, the Construction Regulations contained in the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958, and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations; 1958, came into force on the 1st January. As a result of these Orders there are now no licensed slaughterhouses in the district. A large proportion of the meat 34 sold in the district comes from the London wholesale markets and there does not appear to be any demand from the trade for slaughtering facilities in this district. Two slaughtermen's licences were issued The following foods were condemned during the year Meat (tinned) 2,348% lbs. Meat (raw) 1,530 lbs. Meat (cooked) 86% lbs. Offal 218% lbs. Fish (tinned) 47 lbs. Fish (raw) 686 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 119,822% lbs, Vegetables (tinned) 167% lbs. Tomatoes (tinned) 210% lbs. Miscellaneous Frozen Foods 1,425 pkts. Milk (tinned) 38% lbs. Miscellaneous (tinned) Foods 92% lbs. Miscellaneous (other) Foods 295^ lbs, Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried, under supervision, on the Council's refuse tip. Food Hygiene. 1 have on many occasions expressed the opinion that the education of food handlers is now the most important aspect of food hygiene. This is most effectively done at the place of work of the food handler, in the kitchen, at the butcher's bench, or the shop counter. For reasons which have already been stated, the number of visits by the Public Health Inspectors to food premises fell to the lowest level since 1950 and it was considered that the limited resources available could be used to thq best advantage by talking and lecturing to food handlers in groups rather than as individuals, using coloured film strips and slides in illustration. This kind of work should, of course, be complementary to the regular routine inspection of food pre mises and discussions about food hygiene on the spot. No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. have been granted. 35 Ryelaws made under Section 15 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1938, have been In force in the district since July, 1950. Hawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and, since the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, came into force, has extended toallclasses of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and havetocomply with the Pood Hygiene Regulations. Mobile shops from which groceries, meat., fish, ice cream, refreshments, etc. are sold, are all fitted with wash basins, and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nailbrushes. Number of hawkers registered 60 Number of hawkers' storage premises registered 9 Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) The routine sampling of miscellaneous foods for bac teriological examination was discontinued in 1960 and it was not possible to resume this work during the period under review. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water etc. is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory, for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following table and supplementary information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control officer:- 36  Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 106 7 1 Milk (various) 40 - Butter and Margarine 24 _ Cream 14 - Drugs 1 - Pish and fish products 9 - Pruit (fresh and canned) 34 2 Ice Cream 12 - Meat and meat products 29 1 Sausages 4 - Spirits 4 - Sweets 8 - Vinegar 7 - Miscellaneous 17 1 Total 309 11 "The seven new milk samples shown as unsatisfactory in this list were procured from a pasteurising dairy in Hayes following information (which later was found to be inaccurate) that one of the farmers supplying the dairy had a leaky milk cooler. In fact no added water was found in the milk, although seven of the samples (which were taken one from each churn) were slightly below the presumptive standard for milk solids-not fat. The total quantity of milk sent by the farmer on each of the days, when bulked, was up to the presumptive standard. * "Sulphur dioxide was detected in a sample of pork brawn but was absent from a follow up sample procured at a later date," "A sample of biscuits labelled "Bourbon with Real Chocolate filling" was challenged on the ground that the filling was not real chocolate but a mixture of cocoa butter with other fats and sucrose, cocoa butter being only 5% of the filling material. The manufacturer amended the description to 'Genuine Chocolate Cream Pilling" and was cautioned in respect of the offence committed. * "A seller of Giant Prune plums was warned by the inspector concerned for displaying a label on the plums which described them as Pershore plums. Similar action was taken in respect of 37 the description "Seedless" applied to oranges in which there were some seeds but many fewer than in a normal orange. Merchandise Marks Act, 1887- 1953. Most of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts is to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders (which relate to the indication of the country of origin of certain goods) are properly observed." "Visits of inspection were made to 260 premises in Hayes and Harlington. 1,074 stacks and displays being examined. Only minor infringements, in respect of which the inspector concerned issued a verbal warning, were detected." "Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller (or with a registered trade mark); and also to bear on the label its common or usual name together with a list of the ingredients of which it is composed. The Order also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals are disclosed. Ninety-two premises were visited and 442 articles were examined, no infringements being detected." "Safe Milk. Twenty samples of raw milk were procured and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. Thirty nine samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured and tested for proper processing and twenty-four inspections of the two pasteurising plants in the area were carried out to ensure that the plant and premises were kept in satisfactory condition and that the pasteurising process was properly carried out. Twenty-four samples of "washed" milk bottles were procured for bacteriological examination as a check on the general efficiency of the bottle washing apparatus used by the dairies." Food Poisoning, Three outbreaks of food poisoning involving in all three persons occurred during the year. The causative organism in two cases was Salmonella Typhi Murium and in the other Staphylococcus Pyogenes. 38 Complaints about Food. Twenty-two complaints were received, compared with eleven last year, and forty the year before, about food alleged to be contaminated, unsound or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded; proceedings were taken in three instances.

This programme was completed according to schedule During the year it was agreed that a further 48 unfit houses should be dealt with during the four years 1962 to 1965.

(a) Number of Clearance Areas declared 1 (b) Number of unfit dwellings included in Clearance Areas - (c) Number of unfit dwellings in Clearance Areas demolished - 41 Overcrowding. At the beginning of the year there were 14 known cases of overcrowding. During the year ten new cases were discovered but four of them were abated before the end of the year. In addition seven of the cases brought forward from the previous year were also abated so that the number of known cases at the end of the year was thirteen, i.e. one less than at the beginning. For the first time coloured immigrants were found to be involved in overcrowding and whilst the figures in the previous paragraph show an extremely satisfactory position it is quite clear that this new trend will need watching very carefully. It will only be possible to maintain the present satisfactory position by acting quickly and resolutely whenever overcrowding is found. The average number of occupants for each inhabited house in the district fell to 3.33, the lowest figure since 1938. Certificates of Disrepair. The following action was taken under the Rent Act, 1957, in connection with Certificates of Disrepair: Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 10 Landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 11 Undertakings given by Landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 6 Undertakings by Landlords not accepted Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 4 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) 4 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair refused (Form R.C.3) 1 Certificates of Disrepair cancelled (Form R.C. 2) 2 Applications by Landlord or tenant for Certificate as to the remedying of Defects which Landlord has undertaken to remedy (Form 0) 9 Certificates issued as to the Remedying of Defects specified in a Landlord's Undertaking to remedy Defects (Form P) 6 42 Improvement Grants. Only eight applications for Standard Grants were received and one of these was withdrawn before it had been considered by the Committee. Six applications for Discretionary grants were received and the maximum grant approved in each case. Moveable Dwellings. To avoid involving both the Public Health Committee and Town Planning Committee in this matter and as planning consent is an essential preliminary to a site licence, the enforcement of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, has been entrusted to the Town Planning Committee. Consultation between the Engineer and Surveyor's Department and the Public Health Department takes place on applications for Site Licences. New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and Private Developers:- Council: Houses 51 Old Persons' Dwellings - Flats 54 Maisonettes - Private Development: Dwellings 120 Housing Association: Dwellings - 43 PART V - FACTORIES, SHOPS, OFFICES, ETC, Factories. There are one hundred and sixty two factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including. Aircraft, bread and confectionery, building materials, canned fruit, car accessories, caravans, carbon products, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, cold stores, electrical condensors and transformers, electronic devices, fibre glass articles, furniture, lubricating oil, meat products, optical lenses, plastics, precision tools, radar, gramophone records, rubber products, tarmacadam, steel wool and wood black floors. Pull details of the inspections carried out and notices served are set out in Appendix I to this report, Outworkers. Part VII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons carrying out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. There are 143 outworkers in the district and 100 inspections were made: in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops. All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to 666 premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 180 visits. As a result one informal notice was served but it was not considered necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises, is held in the Public Health Department. Offices, Workplaces, etc. The Offices Act, 1960, due to come into operation on the 1st January, 1962, can be regarded as a dead letter. No 44 lations have yet been made under the Act and without them the Act has no purpose. Moreover, it is understood that the Government has no intention of making Regulations but will, in due course, bring forward a more comprehensive Bill to implement the main recommendations of the Gower Committee on Health, Welfare and Safety in Non-Industrial Employment. It will be remembered (at least, by people who have reached middle age) that the Gower report was published in 1949 and has since been lying forlorn and neglected in its Whitehall pigeon hole. In the meantime the best possible use is being made of the meagre powers already available for securing reasonable conditions in Offices. These are contained in Section 46 of the Public Health Act, 1936, which requires workplaces (the definition of which includes offices) to be provided with satisfactory sanitary accommodation and Section 92 which requires workplaces to be kept clean, properly ventilated and not overcrowded. 45 PART VI - MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide. During the year 107 licences were issued in respect of:- 178,935 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures, 39,455 gallons of cellulose solutions. 896 lbs. of calcium carbide. All licences now incorporate the Model Licensing Conditions suggested by the Home Office in 1957 and the latest recommendations of the Home Office for electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps have been adopted. This work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified officer in the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. During the year 406 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and thirteen minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district the Act does not apply to any of them as the type of filling generally used is outside the scope of the Act, All premises used for upholstery and similar trades are visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and the type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas, electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted. Such appliances are sold at 43 shops in the district and all were visited by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are 46 sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Pour premises are licensed under the Act and 6 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the Licence. Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act, relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and in this district, which is still partly rural, serve a useful purpose. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the local authority, has been adopted by the Council, Registered premises of which there are five, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. Swimming Pools. There is no public swimming pool in the district. A practice pool at a local secondary school is equipped with automatic dosing equipment and continuous filtration. A swimming pool is one of the amenities at an hotel in the district. Continuous filtration and automatic chlorination is carried out. Samples of water from both these pools were taken regularly and only one sample out of fifteen at the school and two out of fifteen at the hotel, were unsatisfactory. These results show that the arrangements for purification of the water were working satisfactorily. Official Searches. During the year 1362 applications for information from persons proposing to acquire premises in the district were dealt with. Each one required answers to questions about sanitary notices or orders (outstanding or contemplated), Smoke Control Orders, Certificates of Disrepair and Slum Clearance. 47 Appendix I Part A.
