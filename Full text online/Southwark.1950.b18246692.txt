The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1950. Reviewing the year briefly as a whole, it will be observed that whilst the population has continued to increase since before the end of the war, the increase in 1950 was much smaller than previously. Further, both birth and death rates are declining. The incidence of the common infectious diseases was low, except for an increase of dysentery and food poisoning, which gives me no little concern, particularly as the causes of these conditions are known and are preventable by "cleanliness" used in its widest meaning. The remedy, I think, is that of education, not only of the food handlers, but also of the public generally. The most pressing need, not only of this Borough, but of the majority of towns in the country, is for more and more housing accommodation. I know of no more important factor which would contribute to the general happiness and wellbeing—and therefore good health, both mental and physical—than that of adequate housing accommodation for every family. The intolerable conditions under which many of our citizens are living and which I come across daily lead not only to much distress and misery but to many broken marriages and in some cases to serious mental breakdowns. I am informed by several of our local medical practitioners that over a third of the patients who attend their surgeries regularly are suffering from serious anxiety neurosis directly due to bad housing conditions. Whether this is an under or an over estimate I cannot say, but I can speak of the deplorable conditions I find, and I know as a medical man that these conditions lead to great mental distress and unrest, and that people being under tension of this nature are neither physically well, nor can they give of their best. In making these remarks, I fully realise that in no way can any reflection be cast on the Council's efforts to produce houses, which are very restricted by higher authority, but I feel that we b2 ii and others should keep on pressing home these serious facts upon those in higher authority as I am convinced that they are too far removed to comprehend fully the distress and difficulties with which we are faced every day. The second problem to which I wish to refer is that of the " Old People." Since the introduction of the National Health Act the plight of many old people has been very acutely and forcibly brought to our notice. The Borough Council has done all it is allowed to do under the law to bring assistance to these people and to encourage the interested voluntary bodies in their welfare work. After two years' experience of dealing almost daily with some problem relating to an old man or woman, one is forced to think that the Ministry of Health are quite satisfied that the situation is covered by the provisions of the Health and Assistance Acts, together with the assistance rendered by voluntary agencies. In spite of all the provisions made, I am certain that this line of thought, based on curative medicine and hospital beds, is a wrong one. To deal with the old people adequately, one must work and think on preventive lines. Many of the conditions which render old people helpless and bedridden when neglected are preventable. Many hospital beds, and the time of district nurses, are being used by old people suffering from conditions which could have been prevented if adequate preventive services had been available. These services can best be provided by the local authorities responsible for environmental health; that is those authorities closest to the problem and who are in daily contact and know the conditions and needs of their citizens. Other comments which I have wished to make on the activities of this Department will be found under the appropriate sections of the report. I would, however, particularly like to point out the large amount of very successful work undertaken during the year by your Sanitary Inspectors, and also to the report on " Smoke Abatement " on pages 13-16. In expressing once again my appreciation of the loyal cooperation received from the Members of the Council, the Public Health Department staff, and the Chief Officers and staffs of other Departments, I must add a personal note on the sad deaths during the year of Alderman A. J. Gillian, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and of Mr. T. Jenkins of the Rodent Control section; also on the retirement of Mr. H. Hattersley, Sanitary Inspector for more than half of his forty years' service. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, W. STOTT, Medical Officer of Health. iii GOLDEN JUBILEE 1900 — 1950 Southwark celebrated its Golden Jubilee as a metropolitan borough in 1950; it was created a borough in 1900 following the Local Government Act of 1899. One of the earliest functions of its first Public Health Committee was to provide a bacteriological service at Guy's Hospital to assist medical practitioners in dealing with suspected infectious diseases. Soon afterwards, the first Public Analyst was appointed for the examination of food samples. There have been many important changes in Public Health during the ensuing 50 years, including the creation of the Ministry of Health, and the establishment of the Maternity and Child Welfare, School Medical, Tuberculosis, and Health Insurance Services, and the introduction of the new Public Health and consolidated Housing Acts. Between 1936 and 1939 the Council had replanned and reconstructed the Treatment and Bathing Centre and built the new Health Services Department—which at that time was probably one of the most up to date and best equipped buildings of its kind—with a complete scheme of health services second to none. These services were severely curtailed by the outbreak of war, and with the introduction of the new National Health and National Assistance Acts, which robbed the Council of its personal health services, many plans for their further development were shattered. It is interesting to note the strides made in the prevention of infectious diseases during this last 50 years. In 1901 Southwards notifications of Smallpox, Scarlet Fever, and Diphtheria alone exceeded the total of all infectious diseases notified in 1950. There were 161 deaths from Measles, 14 from Smallpox, 54 from Scarlet Fever, 98 from Whooping Cough, and 53 from Diphtheria. In 1950, however, the total deaths from all infectious diseases was 65, only 9 of which were due to diseases other than Tuberculosis. iv PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at December 31st, 1950).

The current population estimate includes members of H.M. Forces stationed in the area. There was a decline in both birth and death rates, and also in still births and infant death rates; the two latter were the lowest recorded for many years past.

A particularly pleasing feature was that in 1950 there was not a single confirmed case of diphtheria in this Borough. There were more whooping cough cases than for the past two years, although the figures for this disease in 1949 were exceptionally low, but fortunately there was only one death. Measles shewed a decrease for the second year in succession in conformity with the normal cycle, and there were no deaths from this cause. Both pneumonia and scarlet fever cases were well below the average. Scabies has now decreased to only about 5 per cent. of the number of cases in 1946, even despite the cessation of examination and treatment of contacts. Fourteen cases of poliomyelitis occurred, one of which was fatal ; these figures were the same as for the year 1949. Other deaths of infectious disease cases included one each from dysentery, gastro-enteritis and encephalitis, and four from meningococcal infections. During 1950, the Public Health (Acute Poliomyelitis Acute Encephalitis and Meningococcal Infection) Regulations, 1949, came into operation, by which revised nomenclatures and extended notifiable conditions were applied to meningococcal infections, poliomyelitis and acute encephalitis. ANTHRAX Two cases of Anthrax were notified during the year and were traceable to the handling of goat skins imported from various provinces in India, and from which the blood-stained hair had not been completely removed. The facts were reported to the Ministry, and the Council asked for the regulations governing the importation of these skins to be reviewed in the light of geographical and political changes which have, in recent years, affected the Far East, parts of which are specifically defined in the regulations. C2 6 DYSENTERY There was a marked increase in Dysentery during the year, not only in this district, but throughout the country as a whole. The entire question of the control of this disease and the method by which it is spread is receiving very urgent attention by all medical officers and those interested in preventive medicine. Whereas some few years ago Sonne Dysentery was a disease more or less confined to closed institutions, for some unknown reason it now seems to be escaping from these compact communities, and is, in fact, becoming endemic throughout the population of the whole country.

Notifications, deaths and removals of pulmonary cases remained almost unchanged, although non-pulmonary notifications were twice the number registered in the previous year.

The Centre has undertaken a very considerable quantity of chargeable trade disinfection work during the year, and there have also been increases in the amount of departmental laundry, destruction of verminous goods, and disinfection of common lodging houses. The Superintendent of the Treatment and Bathing Centre investigates all cases of infectious diseases where disinfection or special enquiries are involved. This often necessitates several visits, whilst several instances of persons arriving in this Borough by air from smallpox infected areas or vessels also entailed much time in visiting and the supervision of contacts. A considerable amount of work is concerned with enquiries into cases for burial under the National Assistance Act, and the disinfection, storage, and sale, disposal, or destruction of the effects of these persons. Demonstrations of the work of this Centre are always in frequent demand, and during 1950 14 such sessions were arranged for approximately 127 students. Analysis of work carried out during the year.

Nevertheless their activities have continued with full vigour, and during 1950 nearly 600 more inspections and visits were made by Sanitary Inspectors than in the preceding year.

COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are four women's and two men's common lodging houses in the Borough, which are fully occupied nightly. Thirty inspections of these premises were made by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year, 21 of men's lodging houses and 9 of women's. SMOKE ABATEMENT Mr. G. Stubbs, the Council's Smoke Abatement Officer, reported that the results obtained from the recording instruments, which were in operation from February, proved that the extent of atmospheric pollution in Southwark is a serious matter, and in fact is far worse than had been realised. This applies particularly to the Bankside area, where pollution is so bad that it can be classed as one of the black spots in the kingdom. Comparing these figures with other places as published in the "Atmospheric Pollution Bulletin" of the Fuel Research Station, D2 The figures of the deposited matter as recorded on the sites in Walworth Road and at Bankside are as follows:— 1950 Walworth Road Bankside February 32.9 117.4 tons per sq. mile March 22.7 43.2 „ „ „ „ April 28.9 122.7 May 19.7 41.5 ,, ,, ,, ,, June 17.2 67.1 ,, ,, ,, ,, July 18.8 78.8 ,, ,, ,, ,, August 45.1 65.8 ,, ,, ,, ,, September 16.6 235.0 ,, ,, ,, ,, October 18.8 146.5 ,, ,, ,, ,, November 76.4 138.1 „ „ „ „ December 23.9 146.4 „ ,, „ ,, 14 whilst the records of the Walworth Road site are in keeping with the deposits recorded in other parts of London, the deposits in the vicinity of Bankside are in excess of those of nearly all the industrial centres in the country. Careful investigations indicated that the main source of pollution in the Bankside area was due to ash emitted from the chimneys of the electricity station. The deposited matter in this area can readily be seen as it accumulates in the gutters and in the alleyways. There are 18 chimneys at the station, 14 of which serve solid fuel furnaces. Only two are fitted with grit arresters, and if all the solid fuel furnace chimneys were so fitted it would considerably reduce the emission of grit. The Council's Inspector served an intimation notice under Section 150 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Representations were made to the British Electricity Authority, who stated that in view of the cost, the structural alterations involved, the age of the plant, and the limited life of the existing station, the expense of fitting grit arresters would not be justified. They explained that on completion of the new electricity station now in course of erection the existing station would be dismantled. There is, however, no fixed date for this, as it is dependent on many factors, and in any event it would not take place for some years. The B.E.A. stated they would try to obtain better, though more expensive coal for the station, and to do all they reasonably could to minimise the grit emission. There have been interviews and correspondence with the chief officials of the B.E.A., and the matter is still receiving attention. It has been interesting to observe the influence of rainfall on deposits at Bankside and Walworth Road. Heavy rainfall resulted almost consistently in heavier deposit readings. (See graph page 15.) During the year 19 complaints were received regarding smoke emissions in the Borough, and 83 observations were made by the Inspector. VI 16 OFFENSIVE TRADES There are seven premises engaged in offensive trades in the Borough as follows:— Fellmongers, 5—Tripe Boiler, 1—Soap Boiler, 1. During 1950, 11 inspections were made. DUSTBINS (Proposed amendments to Public Health Act) In connection with the issue of intimation notices during the year to the owners of premises regarding the absence of suitable refuse accommodation, objections were made by the owners on the grounds that it was not the landlord's obligation to supply dustbins, which, it was claimed, were an occupier's utensil. This opinion, in fact, seems to be the general trend of cases decided by the courts. After consideration it was decided to serve upon the owners or agents of the premises a notice under Section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. There is a strong body of opinion in favour of local authorities providing dustbins, and charging the cost to rates, but this is likely to present very great difficulties in a Borough such as this, which consists of many old tenement properties. Meanwhile the L.C.C. have drafted amendments to the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, with a view to inclusion in the forthcoming General Powers Bill, by which they are applying to be relieved of the obligation to hear complaints from aggrieved owners or tenants served with statutory notices to provide dustbins, so that such procedure in London will be on the same lines as in the provinces, namely, through the Summary Courts. This Bill would also provide for expenses recoverable in respect of any premises to be secured by a charge on the premises on the lines of Section 291 of the Public Health Act. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 The above Act, which came into operation in March, re-enacts with certain modifications the Rats & Mice Destruction Act of 1919, and gives the local authority both wider powers and responsibilities to secure freedom from rodent infestation. The new Act replaces the obligation under the 1919 Act for occupiers of land to prevent infestation by rats and mice, by an obligation to notify the local authority of such infestation; it also enables the authority to serve notices, specifying action for the destruction of rats or mice or the prevention of infestation, on both the owner and the occupier. A new clause authorises the local authority to enter infested blocks or groups of buildings, without first serving individual notice on owners or occupiers, to carry out necessary operations. 17 Part II of the new Act imposes upon persons carrying on business in the manufacture, storage, transport, sale, etc., of food and food containers an obligation to give notice to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of any infestation by rats, mice, insects and other pests likely to cause damage to food, and the Minister is empowered to direct these persons to take specific steps to prevent or mitigate such damage to food. This is an amendment of parts of the Infestation Order of 1943, made under the Defence Regulations. Parts of this latter Order are also now replaced so that it is no longer necessary for manufacturers of rat poisons, insecticides, etc., to be licensed by the Government, although regulations may be made to secure approved methods and substances by contractors.

WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, two complaints were received regarding the taste of water. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and samples analysed, but in each instance they were found to be satisfactory. Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 95 Certificates have been issued in respect of the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water at 265 new dwellings as follows:— Pattison House 50 flats Thompson House 24 ,, Bramwell House 52 ,, Dent House 20 „ Manchester Buildings 25 ,, Penrose House 24 „ Knight House 25 ,, Betsham House 25 ,, Staunton House 20 ,, Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 98 During the year 60 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board. FACTORIES Two hundred and ninety-nine inspections of Factories were made during the year, and 49 notices were served.

MINERAL OIL IN FOOD ORDER (AMENDMENT) The above Order came into operation on August 1st, 1950, and provides that the prohibition in the principal order relating to mineral oil in food shall not apply in relation to dried fruits containing not more than one part by weight of mineral oil per 100 parts by weight of dried fruit. It also makes provision regarding articles of food containing mineral oil by reason of the inclusion therein of dried fruit containing mineral oil. This Amendment Order is necessary as large stocks of dried fruit intended for distribution before Christmas were treated with mineral oil in the countries of origin as a deterrent to infestation, to prevent crystallization, and to facilitate separation of the berries in manufacturing processes. Exporting countries have been requested to stop the use of mineral oil for the treatment of dried fruit for consignment to the United Kingdom, but some time must elapse before the instruction is fully effective. The treatment of existing stocks with solvents to eliminate the oil would be impracticable on the scale required. 25 FOOD STANDARDS (PRESERVES) (AMENDMENT) ORDER, 1950 The above Order raised the minimum fruit content of certain jams by amounts varying from 2 to 15 per cent. ICED LOLLIES In consequence of representations made by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee regarding the danger of injury to children from eating iced lollies which have been in direct contact with solid carbon-dioxide, the Ministry of Food intimated that it would be a mistake to give undue prominence to the dangers in question, but asked the trade to draw attention to the importance of keeping dry ice in a separate container, which is the usual practice, or otherwise adequately protecting it from coming into contact with ice or ice cream. The sale of iced lollies or cream contaminated by carbon-dioxide would appear to be an offence, and it might well be that effective action by a local authority may have more useful results than would be obtained from general publicity. ICE CREAM HEAT TREATMENT REGULATIONS Following intimations made by the Council to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee that local authorities should have effective powers to enforce bacterial cleanliness of ice cream products, representations were accordingly made to the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Food. The Ministry of Health, however, informed the Standing Joint Committee that the coliform test could not be regarded as indicating dangerous contamination, and pointed out that the Public Health Laboratory Service had agreed that the test could not be accepted as satisfactory for the examination of ice cream. Accordingly, it was suggested that the Standing Joint Committee should ask the Ministry of Health what steps they suggested should be taken in the case of manufacturers of ice cream whose products consistently fell below Grade 2. ICE CREAM There are 149 ice cream dealers and 26 manufacturers in this Borough, an increase of 28 dealers and 2 manufacturers from last year. Most of the dealers sold only pre-packed ice cream, obtained from the large manufacturers ; a number of local manufacturers possess modern equipment with indicating and recording apparatus. 26 During the year, 102 samples of ice cream were taken with the following results, which show an improvement on those of last year :— 34 samples, Grade I. 22 samples, Grade II. 15 samples, Grade III. 24 samples, Grade IV. 7 samples were not examined by the methylene blue test. Periodical visits were made to all premises and advice given where necessary. A code of standards was sent to each maker and dealer in the Borough, and copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III and IV samples, special attention was drawn to the need for stricter care in the hygiene or manufacture, handling and distribution; special investigations were made at the premises and, where necessary, sampling at various stages of the processes carried out in an effort to detect some fault which may have been causing the unsatisfactory gradings. Improvements were always apparent in subsequent results, although unfortunately there were a few instances—certainly a very small number—where manufacturers did not maintain the improvement once close supervision was relaxed. In one sample only was it found that the minimum fat content was below the 2.5 per cent. suggested by the Ministry of Food; in most samples the fat content was well above the minimum. Inspections were carried out before the registration of any new premises to ensure that they were satisfactory and the requirements of the Heat Treatment Regulations fully understood and complied with. The majority of ice cream makers in this Borough are small one-man businesses, and it should be recorded, with gratification, that the whole of the trade generally has co-operated to the utmost extent to secure the highest standard of hygiene and purity in their products. DESIGNATED MILK During the year the following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. 79 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 109 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 55 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. 27 Supplementary Licences. 15 Supplementary Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 14 Supplementary Licences for Sterilised Milk. 14 Supplementary Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Fifty-three samples of Designated Milks were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Two of these did not satisfy the prescribed tests, and the local authority for the area in which the milk was bottled was informed. Forty-four samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council informed of the results. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 171 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 26. Four hundred and nine inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1923 and 1947 Thirteen samples of condensed milk were purchased under the above regulations for analysis. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the said regulations. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough, which is not in use. Four inspections of the premises were made during the year to ensure that no slaughtering was in operation. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 360 Catering Establishments in the Borough, and during the year 748 inspections were made. Close co-operation has been maintained with the local Food Office in connection with the proposed new food premises and traders, to ensure that premises comply with our requirements before the issue of food licences. BAKEHOUSES There are 38 Bakehouses in Southwark, of which 14 are underground. During the year 127 inspections of these premises were carried out. 28 PHARMACY & POISONS ACT, 1933 During the year 119 visits were paid to the various premises listed by the Council for the sale of Part II Poisons under the above Act. There are 72 names of persons on the Council's list of Sellers of Part II Poisons. PROTECTION OF FOOD During the year the Public Health Committee considered and approved the revised draft byelaws in regard to the protection of food under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Additional suggestions were made relating to the location of lavatories in premises concerned with food handling, the use of cracked or chipped crockery, and the observation of personal cleanliness of persons handling food in the open air. The scope of the byelaws, however, is governed by the byelaw making powers given by Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, and after further consideration it was felt that the only suggestion admissible was that persons offering food for sale in the open air should be subject to the same requirements as regards cleanliness as those engaged in handling, wrapping, or delivery of food. This suggestion was accordingly passed to the Standing Joint Committee. Particular attention has been paid to the question of hygiene in all catering premises and premises where food is prepared. Special Sanitary Inspectors have been detailed for this purpose and careful records compiled of all such premises and the conditions found upon inspection. WRAPPING OF SWEETS BY OUTWORKERS During the year the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee drew the attention of constituent councils, and also referred the Ministry of Food, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Labour and National Service, to the practice of firms supplying outworkers with sweets, etc., which were taken home to be wrapped, and subsequently returned to the firm for sale. It was considered that whilst this practice is not general, it is, nevertheless, wholly undesirable, and that having regard to the difficulties arising in the supervision of outworkers, it should be prohibited. No outworkers in Southwark were employed in this manner. 29 LABELLING OF FOOD ORDER, 1950 This Order came into operation on November 1st, and substantially re-enacts in consolidated form the Labelling of Food Order, 1946, and amending Orders, and introduces certain new provisions. MOLASSES During the year a sample of molasses taken from a vegetarian food shop in the Borough was found to contain lead and other metallic contaminants in poisonous quantities. The contamination varied from 5 to 50 parts per million and some samples contained large quantities of arsenic. These goods were imported in bulk and tinned in 1 lb. and 2 lb. containers by the shopkeeper, who immediately agreed to withdraw the remaining stock. Enquiries revealed that small quantities of molasses which had undergone some refining process were allowed to be imported from Australia, Africa, etc., already packed, and although there was no guarantee that they were free from metallic contamination, they were intended for human consumption. Imports of crude molasses in bulk unpacked form, however, are quite unfit for, and never intended to be used for human consumption; they are imported for industrial purposes only, and the only conclusion was that there had been some illicit diversion of this material on to the market for human consumption.

Work in connection with the Housing Act has been carried out during the year by one inspector only, the appointment to replace the second Housing Act inspector (who retired early in the year) not having been made. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work has been completed and was in progress during the year. HOUSING ACT, 1936 Insanitary houses capable of repair at reasonable expense (Section 9) Although it was not considered practicable to serve formal notices under Section 9 of the Act, the system of issuing "informal" notioes on the person having control of the house has been continued. Four hundred and forty-one notices were issued requesting voluntary action by the owner, and 205 houses have been rendered fit for habitation. A total of 456 inspections and 2,537 re-inspections were made during the year. The work involved was comprehensive and the amount expended considerable. For instance, in the case of Victoria House and Louise House, two blocks of tenement flats in Blendon Row, the cost of repairs exceeded £2,600, whilst for houses in Pollock Road it approached the sum of £8,000. These repairs, which were required to make the premises fit for habitation, included amongst other items extensive plaster work, complete redecoration, roof renewals and thorough overhauls, window repairs and replacements throughout, provision of food cupboards, and the necessary installation of a sink and water supply where necessary. Insanitary houses incapable of repair at reasonable expenses (Section 11) The following premises were represented during the year and Demolition Orders made or undertakings not to re-let accepted accordingly. 34 5, Gaza St. 1 and 2, Namur Terr. 12, 13, 14, Comus Pl.

Nine certificates were issued during the year under the above Acts. Clearance Areas (Section 25). During the year 186 visits were made in connection with clearance areas. There has been no official representation, but the worst areas have been previously mapped and listed as proposed clearance areas. Overcrowding (Section 59). There has been no legal action in regard to overcrowding during the year. This matter is dealt with more fully in the Rehousing section.

The increase in the number of cases dealt with by the Public Health Department emphasises this shortage, which is causing applicants to seek the assistance of the Department for recommendations on grounds of ill-health, insanitary or overcrowding conditions. 1947 1948 1949 1950 Cases investigated on medical, overcrowding and sanitary grounds 933 1,450 1,669 2,156 No. of visits involved 1,263 1,814 2,298 2,587 Medical. Applicants for rehousing seeking priority recommendations on medical grounds have been more numerous than ever, and a most careful scrutiny of these cases has been essential in order that recommendations are made only for the most urgent cases, having regard to the nature of the illness, the condition of the property and the amenities available. Advanced rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis cases, crippling congenital deformities, etc., housed in top floor dwellings, are recommended for ground floor accommodation. Respiratory tuberculosis patients who cannot be given separate bedrooms are usually recommended for rehousing in outer London where the air is less polluted; recommendations are also made for non-pulmonary cases where home conditions are bad, and the numerous cases of recurrent bronchitis or associated respiratory conditions where patients live in very damp dwellings. From consultations with local doctors, it appears that a very substantial proportion of their patients are suffering from some nervous condition attributable to housing conditions. Neurotic tendencies are evident in numerous cases seeking medical priority for rehousing but again only the most extreme cases can be recommended. The following table shows that the necessity for these drastic standards has resulted in fewer recommendations being made despite the increased cases dealt with. This remedial rather than preventive approach, though quite unavoidable, can only add to the cumulative difficulties of rehousing, and is also likely to create a grave sociological problem. 37 Recommendations. 1947 1948 1949 1950 Cases recommended to L.C.C. on grounds of Tuberculosis 101 136 51 47 Cases recommended to L.C.C. on other medical grounds 48 69 101 40 Cases recommended to Southwark Borough Council on medical grounds 24 92 107 100 Total cases recommended 173 297 259 187 Rehoused. 1947 1948 1949 1950 Cases rehoused by L.C.C. on grounds of Tuberculosis 33 49 43 32 Cases rehoused by L.C.C. on other medical grounds 16 28 48 34 Cases rehoused by Southwark Borough Council on grounds of Tuberculosis 19 4 — 2 Cases rehoused by Southwark Borough Council on other medical grounds 6 22 24 31 Cases rehoused by other authorities on grounds of Tuberculosis — — — 1 Total cases rehoused 74 103 115 100 Overcrowding In overcrowding, also, there has been an increase in the new cases reported but a decrease in those abated. Overcrowding is sometimes created in order to gain priority rehousing, but the most careful investigations are made to ensure that such cases are not recommended. Whilst wilful overcrowding renders the offender liable to prosecution, it is not considered practicable to make any prosecutions in view of the extreme shortage of accommodation. Overcrowding is therefore regarded not so much from the legal aspect as from the social circumstances which cause it. Increases in the ages of children constitutes legitimate overcrowding and recommendation is accordingly made. Cases where a member of a family marries and brings his or her partner to live with the parents is strictly illegal but recommendations are usually given as young married couples have little opportunity of avoiding this course. Careful enquiries are made in instances of overcrowding where parents permit married children with their families to come from the provinces to live with them, or where a married couple take up residence in a dwelling and later bring their children to live with them ; where it is evident that these conditions are unavoidable or there is domestic hardship, recommendations are submitted. Similar assistance is given to newly married couples living with one or the other's parents-in-law, where domestic friction is established and where the families are living separately in overcrowded conditions. 38 During the year a check was made on all overcrowded cases on the register, and as a result it was found that 593 premises, 712 families and 3,145 persons were no longer overcrowded. This was largely due to bombing and evacuations during the war, and has accordingly brought the overcrowding percentage in the Borough down from 6.69 to 3.39. The percentage of new cases reported during 1950 was 1.32. These figures relate to persons, not families, living in overcrowded conditions, expressed as a percentage of the estimated population.

Whilst the National Assistance Act, 1948, encourages this help by enabling local authorities to contribute to the needs of voluntary organisations providing mobile meal services, social and recreational clubs, etc., experience has shown an urgent need for services of a more personal nature, particularly frequent and regular informal home visiting. This provides a valuable link for lonely aged folk who are unable or disinclined to join in communal activities, and who otherwise may become serious cases through lack of social contact or timely observation. Many old people are still apt to regard a visit by an official either as "interference" or as an "investigation" which makes it difficult to establish an atmosphere of friendly co-operation and confidence even with the most careful approach. It was therefore thought that informal home visiting would be best dealt with by voluntary workers, and any case needing assistance from an official source referred to the appropriate quarter. 41 The essence of the matter is the need for local authorities to encourage to the fullest extent voluntary efforts to meet the requirements, both material and psychological, of old people living in their own homes, to enable them to continue to do so with whatever assistance may be necessary. With this in view, preparatory arrangements were made during the year to form an Old People's Welfare Committee from representatives of all voluntary and welfare associations in the Borough. One hundred and twenty-seven cases have been referred to the Public Health Department during the year. Satisfactory results in many instances have been achieved through close co-operation between the Department and general practitioners, hospitals, district nurses, the L.C.C. Home Help service, National Assistance Board, etc., but there is still a very pressing need for an extension of the home help scheme, including suitable male personnel; the provision of laundry services; sub-hospital facilities at institutions for the long-stay bed cases which are beyond medical aid; private cubicles with space for a few articles of personal furniture in institutions; and some provision parallel with the former District Medical Officers, for emergency medical aid for the numerous old people who for one reason or another are still not registered with a local doctor. National Assistance Act Compulsory Removals. It was not necessary to take any action under Section 47 during the year, although in a number of cases the Department assisted in arranging voluntary admissions to Institutions. Burial of the Dead. During the year, the Council arranged for 18 burials under Section 50 of the above Act, at a total cost of £145 7s. 0d.
