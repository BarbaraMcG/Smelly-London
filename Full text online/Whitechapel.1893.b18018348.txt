Sanitary Department: No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E. January 17 th, 1894. Gentlemen. Having completed ten years as your Medical Officer of Health, I propose that the present Report shall contain, in addition to the customary Tables which I have hitherto submitted, a series of Tables dealing with the years from 1884, down to the present time. These Tables appear in the second part of the Appendix. I do not propose to discuss these Tables in detail; they have been added so that a continuous record should be ready for reference concerning the most important events connected with the Sanitary history of the Whitechapel District. It is only necessary to explain, that the year 1889 was responsible for the occupation of many houses erected upon sites which had been for some years vacant, hence the sudden increase in the number of deaths after that year. It is interesting to compare the share taken by each disease in making up the Mortality Tables during the ten years. Thus, in the two first years, 27 deaths were registered from Smallpox within the Whitechapel District, then followed for seven years, an entire absence of death from that disease: last year 5 deaths from Small-pox were registered. Most of the other Zymotic diseases have their years of virulency, and those of mildness. Influenza re-appeared after an absence of many years, and during the last three years became responsible for nearly 150 deaths. Diphtheria seems to have come with the intention of remaining. Hitherto it has baffled the most skilled scientist to discover the secrets of its etiology. The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, has recently given evidence that the subjecfl is one receiving the best attention of that Board's Officers. Almost the first work which devolved upon me ten years since, was to review our position, should Cholera arrive in this country. Scarcely a year has passed since then, without the subjedt being 2 discussed very seriously by your Board. During the whole of this period, the disease has been rife in the East, and it has occasionally come very close to our shores. Year by year, however, knowledge has taught many new things which wisdom has utilised, and thus, with total demolition of insanitary areas, and improvements in houses in crowded localities, combined with the sharp look-out which has been maintained by our Port Authorities, the enemy has only landed very rarely, and has had no chance to do much mischief when it did so. It is hoped that increased efforts will be made amongst the strong-holds of Cholera, so that the disease may cease to be the dreadful scourge it has proved in the past. Our only effectual safety lies in the disease ceasing to exist in Egypt. The last volume of the Census Returns has just been issued. I have examined these Returns, and have extracted those Tables which referred to the Whitechapel District. I have prefaced this Report with them, so that they might be readily available for future reference. As. these figures are open to inspection by any requiring special information, I shall only revert to the altered condition since the last Census from one point of view, viz:—the influence of Foreign immigration, upon the Whitechapel District. Included in the City of London, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Stepney, St. George-in-the-East, Mile End Old Town and Poplar, 39,307 foreigners of all nationalities were present on the Census night, and of these, Whitechapel possessed 17,961. Taking, however, only Russians and Russian Poles, the Whitechapel District possesses 13,538, of these country people as compared with 10,213 distributed amongst all the other East End Parishes, including the City of London. That we have received very many during the past ten years is shown by the following figures:— FOREIGNERS RESIDING WITHIN THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT:— Census, 1881. Census, 1891. Russian Poles 4458 Russian Poles 7171 Russians 835 RussiaDs 6367 Dutch 1850 Dutch 1434 Germans 1805 Germans 1651 Austrians 203 Ausirians 710 Other Nations 509 Other Nations 628 It has been still further demonstrated, that this immigration of foreigners into the Whitechapel District, continued during the 3 whole of last year. During 1893, I received through arrangements with the Port of London Medical Officer of Health, imformation that 3886 immigrants were received into the District, under the protection of the Committee of the Jewish Shelter in Leman Street. Investigation proved that over 1926 of these persons settled in Whitechapel, the remainder either went abroad or migrated to neighbouring Districts. Calculated as usual, therefore, it is probable that the population for 1893 has been under estimated. At the Census of 1891, the Whitechapel Districft possessed over 67 per cent, of those Russians and Russian Poles, who were then resident within the Metropolis, and it will be seen from the above statement that the percentage is still increasing. With these few general remarks, I proceed to deal as usual with those facts which influenced the Sanitary condition of the Whitechapel District during the year 1893. Marriages during the year within the District amounted to 550. The total number of births which were registered in the four Subregistration Districts during the 52 weeks amounted to 3098. Of such number, 126 occurred in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, which is in the Mile End New Town Sub-registration District. In 18 of these cases the children were born of women not belonging to the District, and of the remainder, the mothers had previously resided in the Sub-registration Districts as follows -66 in the Subregistration District of Spitalfields; 19 in that of Mile End New Town; 15 in that of Whitechapel Church; and 8 in that of Goodman's Fields. Correctly disposed, therefore, in the same order as the deaths are arranged, the births may be distributed as follows:— Spitalfields. Mile End New Town. Whitechapel Church Goodman's Fields. Total. 907 908 841 424 3080 The District birth-rate therefore equalled 40.9 per 1000. The 1892 District births corrected for a year of 52 weeks, equalled 3051. The total deaths which were registered during the year amounted to 2688. Table B* may be consulted for the numbers registered in each Sub-registration District. *Page iv. 4 From the total number of deaths must be deduced those deaths numbering 1010, of persons not belonging to the District, although they were resident in the District at the date of death. It will be seen from the Appendix Tables, that nearly all such deaths took place in the London Hospital. The Whitechapel District must next be credited with the deaths of those Residents who died in Public Institutions, and elsewhere, outside the DistriifL Such deaths, to the number of 208, are also set out in detail in Table D.* It follows, therefore, that the correct total District deaths amounted to 1886. In 1892, the District deaths corrected for a year of 52 weeks, numbered 1843. The estimated population for the District at the middle of the year 1893, was 75,168. The death-rate for 1893, was 25.0 per 1000. The natural increase of births over deaths was 1194, or a decrease of 39 as compared with the preceding year. Table F* of the Appendix, shows the ages at death of the Residents who died during the year. The percentage of Deaths for each Age period was as follows:— 27.2% of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 15.5 „ „ between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.o ,, ,, ,, 5 snd 20. 14.4 „ ,, „ 20 and 40. 20.7 ,. „ „ 40 and 60. 15.2 „ „ „ 60 and 80. 2.7 ,, „ over the age of 80. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths, including Whitechapel, it is to be noted that the infant deaths were as follows:— The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London equalled 22.7 per cent, of the total deaths, and 16 4 per cent, of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District, those infants who died under the age of one year, equalled 27.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.5 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were, for London, equal to 38.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 26.3 per cent, of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel * Page 71. 5 District, they were equal to 42.7 per cent, of the total deaths, and 26.0 per cent, of the registered births. Table I* indicates the percentage of deaths to total deaths from each class of disease, both for the Metropolis as a whole, including Whitechapel, and also for the Whitechapel District. Generally speaking, observations in former years will again apply to a comparison between these columns. I would, however, particularly call attention to the fact that the District Zymotic record is 14.53 compared with 17.95 for the entire Metropolis. Now, a few words in passing, upon the behaviour of Zymotic diseases in the District during the year. Small-pox has shown a disposition during the past three years to become epidemic, and was responsible for three deaths during last year. Altogether I received 114 notifications for Small-pox; of these 103 referred to persons residing within the District, These cases were removed to the hospitals from places as follows:— From a Philanthropic Shelter 1. From a Registered Common Lodging-house 1. From Infirmaries and Workhouses 36. From General Hospitals 25. From the Well Street Home 1. From the Tower of London 1. From Private Houses 38. A more minute investigation shows that in many of the cases the disease was contracted elsewhere, than at the address given on the notification form, and this matter is now being investigated by the Local Government Board. The inquiry must produce useful information, and as it refers to the whole of the Metropolis, I do not propose now to further discuss this part of the subjecft. I shall, however, probably revert to the matter in a future report. Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, have removed many of our people during the year. The cases of Scarlet Fever which were notified amounted to 776, and of Diphtheria to 192. A complete record of these and other chief Zymotic diseases, appears upon Table O* of the Appendix. At various times during the year, I was informed by the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, that the beds at *Page 30. 6 the various hospitals under the care of the Managers were occupied, and that cases could only be admitted as vacancies occurred. From correspondence with the Clerk, and from other sources, I became aware that the officials at Norfolk House decided which cases should have priority in removal. It thus frequently happened that cases which I deemed to require immediate attention, were passed over for other less urgent cases. This is a matter for the consideration of the Managers, should a block ever again take place. I would suggest that the Medical Officer should be allowed to know in what order the cases ought to be removed from his District, if any departure has to be made from the plan of removing cases in the order in which the notifications arrive at the Office of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board. I sincerely hope that never again will so grievous a dead lock occur. I have no doubt that many will be surprised to learn that our copies of the telegrams and letters, which were sent by the Inspectors to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, asking for the removal of cases, show that the application was repeated, in three instances, 21 times ; in one case, 18 times; in three cases, 15, 16, and 17 times, respectively; and for a less number of applications the following list will prove the loss of time to the Inspectors, and the anxiety to the friends of the patients from the delay which so frequently took place in the removal of the cases:— In 5 cases, 13 applications were made. 2 ,, 12 ,, ,, 4 11 1* ,, ,, 6 ,, 9 ,, ,, 5 ,, 8 ,, 9 ,, 7 ,, ,, 8 ,, 6 „ „ 5 ,, 5 ,, ,, 14 ,, 4 ,, ,, 12 ,, 3 ,, ,, 8 ,, 2 ,, ,, As a result, many parents declined at last to have their children removed at all, and I am not certain that the disease would have attacked more persons in this District, had all cases been treated at home. If good is expected to be the outcome of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board system of removal, such can only be expected when removal is promptly effected. 7 The new disinfecting apparatus, whereby articles are submitted to the action of super-heated steam at high pressure, has been at work since. May, 1893. The whole of the working arrangements were revised, and the duties of the men who were engaged for the purpose, were assigned by the Committee. So far I have reason to be satisfied with the present plan of dealing with infected articles. It is advisable to state that the additions to the Destructor were completed, and the new cells were being worked before the year terminated. It has been unfortunately necessary for several successive years to allude to the preparations which the Board deemed it imperative to make in carrying out the Cholera orders of the Local Government Board. I have little to report upon this matter, because our preparations were mainly renewals of those of last year. It was, however, provided that a large open space in the possession of the Board, should be efficiently drained, so as to be ready upon emergency for the erection thereon of temporary hospitals. The previous policy was again adopted, whereby no public notices were issued, but such notices could have been circulated in a few hours had it been necessary to do so.

Public Mortuary and Coroner's Court. These institutions were opened on the 23rd of March, 1892. During the remainder of that year, 100 admissions were entered into the Mortuary, and throughout the year 1893 a total of 152 bodies were received. The chief details I have hereunder set out:— Total Admissions. No. of Inquests. 1892. 1893. 1892. 1893.

The in the difficulty was enhanced by the fact that whereas Whitechapel all other Metropolitan Water Companies are District. compelled to send water up to a height of 60 feet above the pavement level, the Company to which I refer are by enactment bound to afford a supply up to only 40 feet. The effect of this arrangement has been to limit the water supply to many tenants residing in the upper flats of Model Dwellings. I was compelled, in one instance, to exert some pressure upon the owners of a block of buildings, where the tenants had suffered from the short supply of water: the Owners issued a summons against the Company, and in the result, the summons was dismissed Subsequently, a meeting was convened at which all the Owners of Model Dwellings which were supplied by the Company, were represented. As the outcome of that meeting, memorials were forwarded to the London County Council by the Owners of the Model Dwellings, as well as by some of the Vestries and Boards, who are interested in the matter. The question is of such vital importance to the health of the inhabitants, that I hope some means may be found to avert a repetition of last year's experience. So far as the general quality of the District water supply is concerned, the official returns leave little to be desired. I have generally included in my Report some particulars concerning Registered Common Lodging-houses, and 1 again do so. It has been decided by the Home Secretary that so soon as arrangements can be made, he will transfer the jurisdiction of this class of Lodging-house from the police to the Local Authorities, so far as the Sanitary overlooking of them will be concerned. The police will still retain the right of entry for other purposes. I can only express a hope that the new plan will be as successful as the old plan has been. I have also appended a list of so-called philanthropic shelters within the District. These are in reality Common Lodging-houses b 2 10 not registered. I trust the time will soon arrive when all places set apart for the lodging of the very poor will be benefitted by the official inspections, to which the registered houses have long been subjected. So far as overcrowding went, I was able in two of these shelters to effect a considerable reduction in the number of beds provided. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES, 1893. Name of Street.

The death-rate among the 13,336 persons resident in Model Dwellings was 19-0 per 1000, and the Zymotic death-rate amounted to 4-1 per 1000. 71-6 per cent, of the deaths took place at the various Metropolitan Hospitals and Public Institutions, but only 4 per cent, were compelled to find a final resting place during life in Union Infirmaries. On the other hand the London Hospital and other kindred Institutions afforded asylums to over 22 per cent, of those who had previously lived in Model Dwellings within the District. MODEL DWELLINGS.

It may, perhaps, shortly be necessary to take advantage of it on account of the difficulty with what is known as the" Bell Lane Scheme." This area was represented to the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1877, and was visited at various times by several committees from that Board. Although under Cross's Act it was required that a high death-rate should be present, the abnormal conditions were so apparent, that I have little doubt but Bell Lane would have been scheduled by the Metropolitan Board of Works had that body not ceased to exist. The attention of the London County Council was directed to the Bell Lane area very soon after the Council was formed, and certainly no plea of ignorance can be set up by the Council or its officers as to the condition of the area. Committees have visited the neighbourhood and discussed the question ; the Housing of the Working Classes Committee have received a deputation from the Whitechapel Board; the medical staff and the valuers and surveyors have so frequently inspected the houses that these gentlemen are personally well-known in that part of the district. Still no action has been taken under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. It has even reached me that the Council propose by a plan—other than an improvement scheme—to remove as few of the houses in Middlesex Street and Sandys Row as will enable those streets to be widened equally with the southern end of Middlesex Street, so as to produce a good thoroughfare into the City. Whilst I am writing the matter is before your Board. It has been resolved that a memorial shall be presented to the London County Council, praying the Council to proceed with the Bell Lane area under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. What the result of the memorial may be I cannot predict—but should it share the fate of the Board's former efforts in relation to the Bell Lane area it then remains for the Board—if it pleases to do so—to appeal to the Home Secretary, with whom rests the important question as to who shall bear the cost of the improvement. Lists of these places have, as usual, been included in this 15 Slaughter Houses, Cow Houses and Milk Shops. Report. The last-named list is very liable to constant alteration, and I shall feel obliged to those who can afford necessary information which will enable me to correct it from time to time. A copy of such information shall be forwarded to the London County Council, with whom rests the duty of licensing all slaughter-houses, cow-houses and milk shops. Bye-Laws. In the Appendix will be found reprints of the new bye-laws made by the London County Council, and also by the Whitechapel District Board of Works, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. They have all been confirmed by the Local Government Board. The Sale of Food & Drugs Act, 1875, and The Sale of Food & Drugs Amendment Act, 1879. Mr. R. S. Wrack, the Inspeftor appointed under these Adts, has compiled a list of articles submitted by him to the Public Analyst during the year 1893. They amounted to 124 samples. I have summarised the results as follows:— I have summarised the results as follows:— Nature of Article. Result of Analysis. Remarks.

Mem.:—Where the quality of the article is defective, but is not much adulterated, a caution is administered to the offender by the Clerk. In other cases where the adulteration is proved to be excessive, and no extenuating circumstances are present, the offender is summoned before a magistrate. I am sometimes questioned upon the number of prosecutions which take place under the various Acts of Parliament concerned in the sanitary work of the Board. It may prove interesting to 16 some if I include here a list of summonses which were issuec during the year 1893 Date. Offence. Result.

Fined Although it is necessary now and again to thus deal with offenders, my experience harmonises with that in the history of the Board, that it is generally possible by judicious action to obtain even better results from friendly consultation than would be the case were prosecutions more frequent. And now, gentlemen, I have to invite your perusal of Table P* wherein is set out the summary of your Inspectors' work during the year. I have incorporated in this Report a letter which I have received from those officers. Year after year I have felt it to be my pleasant duty to commend their regular consistent work, which, in the aggregate, amounts to the huge total detailed in the Table. I can only repeat my former commendations, and thank them for the genial and ready way in which they accept and execute all my wishes. The results of those labours are thus before 3'ou, and, in conclusion, I would merely ask that you will not blame for defects discovered, but rather that you will be content to award to them praise for much good work done during the year, and to feel assured that very much more has been mapped out to be gone through during the year, 1894. * Page 32. 17 Personally, I owe much to the assistance of my friends the Clerks and the Surveyor, who have, at all times, been ready to afford advice and help. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. 19 APPENDIX. AREA AND POPULATION OF THE DISTRICT OR DIVISION TO WHICH THIS RETURN RELATES.

Sir, The accompanying Tabulated Statement sets out the amount of work carried out by us during the past year. The total sum of work is considerably larger than that for the previous year. To give details of all the work would take up too much space, but although the work has been a great strain upon us, we have cheerfully endeavoured to carry out the duties imposed upon us to the best of our ability, and we trust to your entire satisfaction. It will be seen from the said Statement that Drainage Works have been carried out in a very large number of premises, including "The Sailors' Home," "The Foundation School," "St. Mary's Schools, Church Passage, Spitalfields," "The Central Bank,'' and " The Whitechapel Church." Notwithstanding the large increase in the general work of the District we have been able to devote some attention to overlooking the workshops under the Order issued by the Home Secretary. Very great care and attention was paid during the year to the question of unwholesome food, and it will be seen that large quantities of various articles were seized and destroyed. In the main the Vendors were cautioned, but several summonses were issued resulting in fines and costs amounting to £8 11s. Last year we reported that 1153 cases of Infectious Disease had occurred, but this year we are sorry to have to report an increase of 230 cases, making the total for the year 1383 cases. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. The insufficient Hospital accommodation during the Summer months, largely increased the work in this particular branch. We are, Sir Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, THOS. P. WRACK, Sanitary GEORGE HARVEY, Inspectors. ALFRED COOK, 30th December, 1893. 38 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Bye.-laws made by the London County Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Bye-laws under Section 16 (2). For prescribing the times for the removal or carriage by road or water of any faecal, or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, and providing that the carriage or vessel used therefore shall be properly constructed and covered so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid, and as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Faecal and offensive matter. 1. Every person who shall remove or carry by road or water in or through London any faecal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid shall be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through London, shall not remove or carry such matter or liquid in or through London except between the hours of 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the forenoon during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, and except between the hours of 6 o'clock in the forenoon and 12 o'clock at noon during the months of November, December, January, and February.

Every person who shall propose to close or till up any cesspool or privy, shall before commencing any works for such purpose, give to the Sanitary Authority for the district not less than forty-eight hours notice in writing, exclusive of Sunday, Good Friday, Christmas Day, or any bank holiday, specifying the hour at which he will commence the closing and filling up of such cesspool or privy, and during the progress of any such work shall afford any officer of the Sanitary Authority free access to the premises for the purpose of inspecfting the same. As to the removal and disposal of refuse, and as to the duties of the occupier of any premises in connection with house refuse so as to facilitate the removal of it by the scavengers of the Sanitary Authority. 4. The occupier of any premises who shall remove or cause to be removed any refuse produced upon his premises shall not, in the process of removal, deposit such refuse, or cause or allow such refuse to be deposited upon any footway, pavement, or carriageway. Removal and disposal of refuse. Provided that this bye-law shall not be deemed to prohibit the occupier of any premises from depositing upon the kerbstone or upon the outer edge of the footpath immediately in front of his house, between such hours of the day as the Sanitarv Authority shall fix and notify by public announcement in their district, a proper receptacle containing house refuse, other than night soil or filth, to be removed by the Sanitary Authority in accordance with any bye-law in that behalf. 5. Every person who shall convey any house, trade or street refuse across or along any footway, pavement or carriageway shall use a suitable receptacle, cart, carriage, or other means of conveyance properly constructed so as to prevent the escape of the contents thereof, and in the case of offensive refuse so covered as to prevent any nuisance therefrom, and shall adopt such other precautions as may be necessary to prevent any such refuse from being slopped or spilled, or from falling in the process of removal upon such footway, pavement or carriageway. If in the process of such removal any such refuse be slopped, or spilled, or fall upon such footway, pavement or carriageway, such person shall forthwith remove such refuse from the place whereon the same may have been slopped or spilled, or may have fallen, and shall immediately thereafter thoroughly sweep or otherwise thoroughly cleanse such place. Daily removal of house refuse 6. Where a Sanitary Authority arrange for the daily removal of house refuse in their district or in any part thereof, the occupier of any premises in such district or part thereof on which any house refuse may from time to time accumulate shall, at such hour of the day as the Sanitary Authority shall fix and notify by public announcement in their district, deposit on the kerbstone or on the outer edge of the footpath immediately in front of the house or in a conveniently accessible position on the premises, as the Sanitary 40 Weekly removal of house refuse.

The Sanitary Authority shall cause to be removed not less frequently than once in every week the house refuse produced on all premises within their district. 8. Where, for the purposes of subsequent removal, any cargo, load, or collection of offensive refuse has been temporarily brought to or deposited in any place within a sanitary district, the owner (whether a Sanitary Authority or any other person) or consignee of such cargo, load, or collection of refuse, or any person who may have undertaken to deliver the same, or who is in charge of the same, shall not without a reasonable excuse permit or allow or cause such refuse to remain in such place for a longer period than twenty-four hours. Provided (a) that this bye-law shall not apply in cases where the place of temporary deposit is distant at least one hundred yards from any street, and is distant at least three hundred yards from any building or premises used wholly or partly for human habitation, or as a school, or as a place of public worship or of public resort or public assembly, or from any building or premises in or on which any person may be employed in any manufacture, trade, or business, or from any public park or other open space dedicated or used for the purposes of recreation, or from any reservoir or stream used for the purposes of domestic water supply; (b) that this bye-law shall not prohibit the deposit, within the prescribed distances, of road slop unmixed with stable manure for any period not exceeding one week, which may be necessary for the separation of water therefrom. 9.

Provided always that this bye law shall not be deemed to require or permit any Sanitary Authority or person to dispose of or destroy by fire any night-soil, swine's-dung or cow-dung. 10. A Sanitary Authority or any person on their behalf who shall remove any offensive refuse from any street or premises within their district shall not deposit such refuse, otherwise than in the course of removal, at a less distance than three hundred yards from any two of more buildings used wholly or partly for human habitation or from any building used as a school, or as a place of public resort or public assembly, or in which any person may be employed in any manufacture, trade or business, or from any public park or other open space dedicated or used for the 41 purpose of recreation, or from any reservoir or stream used for the purposes of domestic water supply. Provided always that this bye-law shall not be deemed to prohibit such deposit of such refuse for a period of twenty-four hours, when such refuse is deposited for the purpose of being destroyed by fire, in accordance with any bye-law in that behalf. 11 For the purposes of the foregoing bye-laws the expression "offensive refuse" means any refuse, whether "house refuse,'' "trade refuse," or "street refuse," in such a condition as to be or to be liable to become offensive. Penalties Penalties. 12. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided nevertheless that the Court before whom any complaint may be made, or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence, may, if the Court think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law.

With respect to waterclosets, earthclosets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. 1. Every person who shall hereafter construct a watercloset or earthcloset in connection with a building, shall construct such watercloset or earthcloset in such a position that, in the case of a watercloset, one of its sides at the least shall be an external wall, and in the case of an earthcloset two of its sides at the least shall be external walls, which external wall or walls shall abut immediately upon the street, or upon a yard or garden or open space of not less than one hundred square feet of superficial area, measured horizontally at a point below the level of the floor of such closet. He shall not construct any such watercloset so that it is approached directly from any room used for the purpose of human habitation, or used for the manufacture, preparation, or storage of food for man, or used as a factory, workshop, or workplace, nor shall he construct any earthcloset so that it can be entered otherwise than from the external air. He shall construct such watercloset so that on any side on which it would abut on a room intended for human habitation, or used for the manufacture, preparation, or storage of food for man, or used as a factory, workshop, or workplace, it shall be enclosed by a solid wall or partition of brick or other materials, extending the entire height from the floor to the ceiling.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891. BYE-LAWS Made by the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District, being the Sanitary Authority for the said District, for the Prevention of Nuisances. Interpretation of Terms. 1. Throughout these bye-laws the expression "the Sanitary Authority" means the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District. For the Prevention of Nuisances arising from any Snow, Ice, Salt, Dust, Ashes, Rubbish, Offal, Carrion, Fish, or Filth, or other Matter or Thing in any Street. 2. The occupier of any premises fronting, adjoining or abutting on any street not repairable by the inhabitants at large shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the cessation of any fall of snow, remove or cause to be removed from the footways and pavements adjoining such premises and forming part of such street all snow fallen or accumulated on such footways and pavements in such a manner and with such precautions as will prevent any undue accumulation in any channel or carriageway or upon any paved crossing. The person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control ot the premises, or if there is no such person, then any person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of any part of the premises, and in the case of any premises the whole of which is let in tenements or to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the tenants or lodgers, either on his own account or as the agent of another person, shall for the purposes of this bye-law be deemed to be the occupier. 3. Every person who shall remove any snow from any premises on to any carriageway shall deposit the same in such a manner and with such precautions as to prevent any accumulation thereof in any channel or upon any paved crossing. If in the process of such removal any snow be deposited upon any footway or pavement in any street, he shall forthwith remove such snow from such footway or pavement. 4. Every person who shall throw any salt upon any snow on the footway of any street shall do so in such quantity and in such manner as effectually to dissolve the whole of such snow, and he 6o shall forthwith effectually remove from the footway the whole of the deposit resulting from the mixture of salt with the snow. He shall not place any part of such deposit on the carrriageway of such street elsewhere than in proximity to any channel at the side of such carriageway, and he shall not remove any part of the same into any such channel unless it is sufficiently liquid to flow along such channel. No person shall throw any salt upon any snow on the carriageway of any street, unless it shall be practicable forthwith effectually to remove the whole of the deposit resulting from the mixture of the salt with the snow. Every person who shall throw any salt upon any snow on any such carriageway shall forthwith effectually remove the whole of the deposit, but he shall not place any part thereof on the footway of such street or on any paved crossing, or on the carriageway in such a manner as to interfere with the carriage traffic, nor shall he place any part thereof in the channel at the side of the carriageway, unless it is sufficiently liquid to flow along such channel. 5. A person shall not throw, cast, or lay, or cause to be thrown, cast, or laid, any dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or other like matter or thing in or upon any part of a street. Provided always that this bye-law shall not apply to any act which is for the time being an offence within the meaning of any public general statute, or of any bye-law made by the London County Council and in force in the place where such aCt is done. Provided also that it shall not be an offence against this byelaw to lay any ashes or other suitable material in any street in time of frost to prevent accidents. 6. Every person who shall lay or cause to be laid in any street any litter or other matter in case of sickness to prevent noise, shall lay the same so that it may be evenly distributed over the surface of the part of the street intended to be covered, and shall, when the occasion ceases, within forty-eight hours thereafter remove or cause to be removed from such street the litter or other matter so laid in such street. For Preventing Nuisances arising from any Offensive Matter running out of any Manufactory, Brewery, Slaughter-House, Knacker's Yard, Butcher's or Fishmonger's Shop, or Dunghill, into any Uncovered Place, whether or not surrounded by a Wall or fence. 7. The occupier of a manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or of any premises comprising a dunghill, shall not cause or suffer any offensive matter to run out of such manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence, so as to be likely to become a nuisance. 61 For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. 8. The occupier of any premises shall not keep nor allow to be kept any animal on such premises in such a place or in such a manner as to pollute, or to be likely to pollute, any water supplied for use or used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, or any water used or likely to be used in any dairy. 9. Every occupier of a building or premises wherein or whereon any horse or other beast of draught or burden, or any cattle may be kept, shall deposit or cause to be deposited in a suitable receptacle all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or noxious matter other than urine and other liquid filth which may, from time to time, be produced in the keeping of any such animal in such building or upon such premises. He shall likewise provide in connection with such a building or premises a sufficient drain, constructed in such a manner, and of such materials, and maintained at all times in such a condition, as effectually to carry away all urine and liquid filth or refuse therefrom. Except where the Sanitary Authority by notice duly given under the statutory provision in that behalf shall have otherwise required, he shall, once at least in every week, remove or cause to be removed from such building or premises all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or noxious matter produced in or upon such building or premises, and deposited in a receptacle as hereinbefore required. Provided that this requirement shall not apply to the occupier of any stable or cowhouse from which the Sanitary Authority remove or contract for the removal of manure and other refuse matter. Where for the purpose of preventing the keeping of any horse or other beast of draught or burden or any cattle on any premises so as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, it is necessary that the floor of the building in which such animal is kept should be impervious to liquid matter, no person shall keep any animal in such building unless or until the floor thereof shall have been paved with a hard and impervious pavement evenly and closely laid and so sloped as to effectually carry off all liquid matter therefrom to a properly trapped inlet to the drain hereinbefore required to be provided. As to the paving of yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling-houses. 10. The owner of every dwelling-house in connection with which there is any yard or open space shall, where it is necessary for the prevention or remedy of insanitary conditions that all or part of such yard or open space shall be paved, forthwith cause 62 the same to be properly paved with a hard, durable, and impervious pavement, evenly and closely laid upon a sufficient bed of good concrete, and so sloped to a properly constructed channel as effectually to carry off all rain or waste water therefrom; and he shall cause such pavement to be kept in proper repair. Penalties. 11. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law.

The owner of any premises on which a tank, cistern, or other receptacle not provided by the occupier of such premises is used for storing of water used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall cause every such tank, cistern, or other receptacle which is erected outside a building, or which, being erected inside a building, is not placed in a suitable chamber or otherwise constructed or placed so as to prevent the pollution of the water therein, to be provided with a proper cover. 4. The occupier of any premises on which a tank, cistern, or other receptacle is used for storing of water used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall empty and cleanse the same, or cause the same to be emptied and cleansed, once at least in every six months, and at such other times as may be necessary to keep the same in a cleanly state and free from pollution.
