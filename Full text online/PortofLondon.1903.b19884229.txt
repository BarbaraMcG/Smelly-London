PLON 9 REPORT, For the Year ended 31st December, 1903, OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE POET OF LONDON. BY HERBERT WILLIAMS, M.D., M.D. (State Medicine), Lond University, M.R.C.S.Eng., L.R.C.P.Lond., D.P.H.Camb., medical officer of health, port of london, fellow of the sanitary institute, fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health, fellow of the royal geographical society. LONDON: Printed by Charles Skipper & Bast, 49, Great Tower Street, E.C. 1904. RITCHIE, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 14:th day of April, 1904. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health to the 31st December last; which was read. Resolved, That the consideration thereof be adjourned, and it is Ordered that the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. We whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation as the Port of London Sanitary Authority by the Local Government Board, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Herbert Williams, the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London for the year ended the 31st December, 1903, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work done in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. The Report gives, amongst other matters, much interesting information respecting Plague and the destruction of rats on board ships coming into the Port, and on the premises of the various Dock Companies, and also with regard to Cholera, Small-pox and Enteric Fever, the Inspection of Canal Boats, and Food Inspection. The Report also deals at considerable length with the question of Alien Immigration, and the Report of the Royal Commission appointed to investigate the same. 2 In accordance with the instructions of your Honourable Court, on our recommendation, a communication was addressed to the Board of Trade, urging that steps should be taken at the earliest possible date to carry into effect the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and at the same time expressing the opinion that the medical examination of alien immigrants and the duty of regulating the accommodation upon immigrant vessels should be entrusted to the Port Sanitary Authority. It is satisfactory to note that, notwithstanding the difficulties attending the medical inspection of vessels at Sheerness, the Report of the Medical Officer shows that the proportion of Foreign vessels visited has been larger than in previous years, and that the inspection is now carried out by Dr. Legge with a degree of efficiency not attained under any previous arrangement. An important decision has recently been given in the Court of Appeal arising out of proceedings taken by order of your Committee against the owner of the steam tug " Richmond," for smoke nuisance, which will have an important bearing upon the work of the Port of London Sanitary Authority in their efforts to abate this evil. The Judgment of the High Court is set out in the Medical Officer's Report. In accordance with the Order of your Honourable Court, an Account of Receipts and Expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary Authority for the year ended the 31st December last is appended. All which we submit to the judgment of your Honourable Court. Dated this twelfth day of April, 1904. James Lake. Horace S. Dove. Geo. Taylor. Robt. Gresley Hall. J. Cloudsley. Rob. B. Warrick. N.

PORT OF LONDON SANITARY OFFICES, GREENWICH, S.E. April, 1904. TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report on the work of your Officers, and the general conditions affecting the public health in the Port of London, for the year ending 31st December, 1903. The general increase in the work done, to which I called attention in my last Annual Report, has been maintained throughout the past year, and the record appears to be one of steady progression. Thus, as shown on a reference to Table I., the total number of visits of inspection made by your Sanitary Inspectors, for the year 1903, was 35,485, an advance on the preceding year of nearly 2,000 inspections, and upwards of 3,000 above the average for the preceding five years. I last year drew attention to the important question of sailing barges and other vessels engaged in navigation entirely within the limits of the Ports of London, Rochester, Faversham and Colchester. I have this year classed all such vessels under the heading "Inland Navigation," from which it will be seen that a considerable amount of attention is given to this class of vessels. I have also shown separately the figures referring to inspections of premises other than vessels, which form an important and increasing part of the duties of your Inspectors. Of the total of 35,485 visits of inspection, 14,552 were to vessels lying in various parts of the River. 20,831 Inspections were made in the docks and in the Gravesend District, while 102 vessels were inspected in that portion of the River Medway which is within the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority. Of the total number, 3,133, or 9 per cent., required cleansing, this cleansing being of the general kind, which is carried out on verbal representations being made by your Inspectors. Of the total number of vessels inspected, 15,989 were from Foreign ports, 5,338 arrived coastwise, and 13,294 vessels came within the description of " Inland Navigation," while 864 inspections were made of premises on shore. Of the nationality of vessels inspected, 29,444 were British, equal to 82'97 percent. of the total, Swedish and Norwegian totalled 1,743, or 4.91 per cent. and German 1,063, or 2.99 per cent. The number o0f seamen found by your Inspectors on their visits suffering from sickness of a non-infectious character, and referred to the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, amounted to 40. The work done by the Steam Launches is also shown. The "David Burnett" being used in visiting 4,265, the "Clotho" 4,120, and the "Denton" 3,447 vessels during the year. In illustration of the large area traversed by the Port of London, a list is given in Appendix J of the Cities, Boroughs, Urban and Rural Districts abutting upon the Port. TABLE I.

The total number of vessels medically inspected at Gravesend during the year was 2,552. This number is higher than any total for the preceding five years, and considerably above the mean for that period (Table II.). This means, of course, that increased vigilance has been necessary on the part of your Medical Officers in dealing with the possible introduction of cases of Plague, as well as other infectious diseases, into the country. The results of this inspection are set out by me under the various headings in relation to Infectious Diseases. I have much pleasure in recording the courtesy and co-operation of the Officers of H.M. Customs in carrying out this important duty, and especially would I mention the Inspector of the Waterguard, J. C. Elliott, Esq., I.S.O. I would like to take the opportunity here of pointing out that the Return of Medical Inspections at Sheerness of vessels arriving in the Medway (Table III.) shows that a larger proportion of foreign arrivals are visited than was at one time the case, and it is probable that the medical inspection there on behalf of the Port Sanitary Authority is now carried out with a degree of efficiency not attained under any previous arrangement, a circumstance which reflects great credit on Dr. E. V. Legge, the Boarding Medical Officer stationed there. The following Memoranda Avere, with the approval of your Worshipful Committee, sent to the Brethren of the Trinity House for distribution to Pilots and other persons concerned:— INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF PILOTS ENTERING THE PORT OF LONDON. Gravesend District. The Upper limit of the Boarding Station at Gravesend is situated at the Customs House, and vessels should on no account proceed up River beyond that point until visited by the Officers of H.M. Customs, with the Port Medical Officer, and all requirements of these Officers complied with. A Medical Officer of the Port Sanitary Authority is always on duty at Gravesend, and accompanies the Officers of H.M. Customs to every vessel coming "from foreign." Every endeavour is made that these vessels shall be visited in the lower part of Gravesend Reach. I therefore suggest for the guidance of Pilots that every vessel "from foreign" shall slow down in the Lower Hope. That the Master be reminded to report on arrival to the Customs Officer every case of illness existing, or that has existed, on board during the voyage from the first port of 11 departure, including the stay of vessel in such port of departure. The Medical Officer of this Authority will then relieve the Master of the responsibility of deciding whether the case is of an infectious nature. Vessels from Infected Ports must bring to at the Boarding Station, and no person allowed to land pending the visit of the Medical Officer of Health, who, at his discretion, will have every person on board mastered for inspection. This applies, without exception, to Asiatic crews and passengers on such vessels, and all persons on such vessels not carrying a Surgeon. The Master should be instructed to have a list containing the names and addresses of all persons leaving such ship in the Port of London ; this must be handed to the visiting Medical Officer on board the vessel. Should there be a case of infectious disease on board, the vessel must anchor opposite the Hospital of the Port Sanitary Authority at Denton. Vessels are cleared in the order of their arrival as far as practicable,, and much inconvenience is often caused by vessels astern passing those ahead in the hope of being cleared first. Such action should be discountenanced. If Pilots will be good enough to see that the above instructions are observed, and, in the case of infected or suspected vessels, have the crew and passengers (if any) mustered on the deck of the vessel, much valuable time will be saved, and the vessel enabled to proceed without appreciable delay. Sheerness District. A Medical Officer is stationed at Sheerness for the purpose of visiting, with H.M. Coastguard, all vessels coming "from foreign" As the Medical Officer requires at least ten minutes' notice so as to get to the Boarding Station in time to accompany the Officers of H.M. Coastguard, the Pilots should be instructed to hoist the National Ensign by day and at night a White Light on Port bow on entering the Port of London, which is represented by a line drawn from Havengore Creek in Essex to Warden Point in the Isle of Sheppey. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Table IV. shows (a) the total number of cases of Infectious Disease reported during the year, and (b) the total number treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital, for each of the five years ending the 31st December, 1902, with the mean annual number for that period, and the total number of cases for the year ending 31st December, 1903. 12 TABLE IV.

There has been no diminution in the distribution of Plague throughout the world during 1903, it has instead become more generally diffused. During the year Plague has existed in:— Europe Marseilles. Asia Japan, China, India, Philippine Islands, Malay Peninsula, Arabia and the Persian Gulf, Africa Egypt, Algiers and South Africa. North America Mexico and San Francisco. South America Brazil, Argentine Republic, Peru and Chili. Australasia Australia and New Caledonia. Hawaiian Islands. Mauritius. This wide distribution has necessarily caused a considerable increase in the number of vessels requiring medical inspection on arrival at Gravesend. A small outbreak of Plague occurred in September at Marseilles, at a paper factory. About fifteen persons appear to have been attacked, of whom at least six died. The outbreak was quickly stamped out, and no extension into other localities seems to have occurred. Six cases in all were reported by vessels on arrival ; of these, three were admitted to the Port Sanitary Hospital, but neither of these proved to be really Plague. On Saturday, the 10th January, the s.s. "Oroya," of Liverpool, arrived at Gravesend. After leaving Port Said, a native fireman complained to the surgeon of a pain in his left groin. On examination he was found to have a tender and painful bubo in that situation, accompanied by fever. On arrival at Naples no person was allowed to land, and the vessel sailed for Marseilles in strict quarantine. At Marseilles several passengers were landed in the ship's boats, but were placed under supervision in quarantine. On arrival at Gravesend it was deemed advisable as a precautionary measure to take the man to the Port Sanitary Hospital for observation and bacteriological examination. Some fluid from the bubo was submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported that the results were entirely negative as regards pestis. 14 It is interesting here to contrast the treatment of the vessel by the Italian and French Governments, with that adopted in English ports, since it is generally accepted that the English method gives ample security from danger to the public health. The s.s. "Omrah" arrived on the 28th March from Sydney. On the 13th March a lascar complained of painful swellings under the armpits, with buboes in each groin. The patient was feverish. The surgeon regarded the case as suspicious, and at once isolated the patient in a special hospital which was erected. The patient was landed at Suez, where all effects were disinfected by the medical authorities. I received information from the British Consul at Suez that the case was found, on bacteriological examination not to be Plague. All being well on arrival, the vessel was allowed to proceed to dock in the usual way. On April 28th, at 11 a.m., the s.s. "Orizaba," of Liverpool, 93,688, from Sydney, arrived at Gravesend. A patient suffering from symptoms suspiciously like those of Plague had been landed at Suez on the 13th April, and measures of disinfection were carried out by the Sanitary Authorities there. On arriving at Naples the vessel was again disinfected, and the vessel proceeded to London via Plymouth. On arrival at Gravesend the vessel was boarded by the Medical Officer on duty, and in view of the suspected case of Plague landed at Suez, a thorough examination was made of persons on board, including one patient who was ill suffering from Pneumonia. All on board were found free from symptoms of Plague, and were allowed to land after furnishing their names and addresses. The remaining cases present no points of special interest. Suspected Plague in London. On the evening of the 24th December last, information was received from the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, that two Chinese natives had died there from a form of Septic or Broncho-Pneumonia. These men had been admitted from a Chinese lodging-house in Stepney. The medical men in attendance were suspicious, having regard to the rapidly fatal character of the cases, and from the fact that they had occurred in two persons from the same house, and closely followed one another, that the cases might on further investigation prove to be Plague. Before the men died, one was understood to say he came from the s.s. "Dundas," and the other from the s.s. " Hasleden." Neither of the men could speak English. 15 Enquiry showed that no vessels of these or any similar names had been in the Port of London for at least three months. Information of the cases was forwarded the same evening from the Office to the Medical Officer of Health for Stepney, and to the Local Government Board. A post-mortem examination was held next morning (the 25th), which was attended on behalf of the Port Sanitary Authority. Specimens of material were obtained and forwarded at once by special messenger to the Local Government Board for bacterioscopic examination. The following day (26th) additional specimens were obtained and forwarded for further investigation. The bacterioscopic examination failed to establish a diagnosis of Plague, but that death in each case was due to acute Broncho-Pneumonia following Influenza. The cases were of considerable clinical interest, and the prompt action taken by your Officers on receipt of the information was fully justified. The International Sanitary Conference was held in Paris from October to December last on the subject of Plague, Yellow Fever and Cholera. No official account of the proceedings has yet been obtainable, but from accounts appearing in the Press it appears that two important questions discussed were: (1) the reduction of the period for detention of infected vessels from twelve to seven days, and (2) the recognition of the fact that rats played an important part in the diffusion of Plague, and that certain measures should be taken for the destruction of these rodents. The destruction of rats on board ships and ashore on the premises of the various Dock Companies has continued. The work is carried on by professional ratcatchers, who are paid by the Dock Companies and Shipowners, and over whom your Officers have no control. In certain of the docks, the dead rats have to be produced to some responsible person, who keeps the record, but this is not done everywhere. Although the number of rats destroyed during the year is considerable, it is doubtful if this represents even the natural increase of births over deaths. 16 A large amount of money is expended annually by the Dock Companies in the destruction of rats, but I am sure they do not get complete value for the money spent, and I feel confident if the same amount were expended by this Authority the number destroyed would be considerably increased, as it would then be possible to directly control the work of the professional ratcatcher. The French Government has decreed that all vessels coming from or touching at a plague infected port must be fumigated, with a view to the killing of all rats on board, before any cargo is allowed to be landed in a French port, and the cost of this has to be borne by the shipowners. This rigorous procedure is in strong contrast" with the practice in the Port of London, where shipowners are only invited to co-operate with this Authority in preventing, as far as possible, rats from going on shore, and to capture as many rats as possible during the stay of the vessel in the Port. It should be clearly understood that all rats captured are destroyed, and are not allowed to leave the jurisdiction of this Authority.

There has been a severe outbreak of this disease in Mexico—at Linares, Monterey and Vera Cruz, where two British ships became infected. Other outbreaks have occurred in Brazil, Panama, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Only three cases are reported during the year from the West Coast of Africa. No cases have been reported on any vessel arriving in the Port of London. CHOLERA. There has been no outbreak of Cholera in Europe during the past year. The disease has, however, existed in Syria and Palestine. It is possible that the extension of the disease to Europe has been prevented by adverse climatic conditions. It must, however, be recognised that with Cholera lying dormant in the Eastern Levant, a danger threatens Europe, and therefore during the ensuingsummer months every precaution will be necessary in the direction of medical inspection of vessels on arrival in this country. The following is a brief summary of the cases reported during 1903 :— The s.s. "Royal" arrived on the 30th January, and reported five cases of Cholera during the voyage, between Alexandria and Malta. On arrival at Malta the forecastle and all living rooms were disinfected, and all infected beds, bedding and clothing destroyed by burning. After leaving Malta all on board enjoyed good health. A medical man was shipped there and brought to London. On arrival at G-ravesend all were found well on inspection; their names and addresses were taken and notified in the usual manner. The vessel laid at Gravesend for 24 hours, and then proceeded to dock, all being well. She was kept under observation during her stay in London, and no further sickness occurred. After discharging her cargo in London the vessel sailed for Barry, the Medical Officer of Health there being notified of the departure from London. All the facts were reported to the Local Government Board, in accordance with the Regulations relating to Cholera. 19 The s.s. "Wakasa Maru" arrived at Gravesend on the 16th December. The vessel left Yokohama on the 17th October last on a voyage to London, calling at several ports. Four cases of Cholera occurred between Yokohama and Singapore, and the vessel therefore came within the provisions of the Regulations of the Local Government Board relating to Cholera, Yellow Fever and Plague as a vessel infected with Cholera. It appears, however, that adequate measures of disinfection had been adopted on the arrival of the vessel at Singapore, and that no further cases of Cholera, or of any disease or sickness resembling Cholera, had occurred from the time the vessel left Singapore until her arrival at Gravesend. A detailed examination was made by your Medical Officer, who boarded the vessel at Gravesend, with the result that all persons on board were found in good health. The vessel was therefore allowed to proceed to dock, and arrangements were made for a daily visit to the vessel for the purposes of inspection, and medical examination of all persons on board. This was carried out during the whole time that the vessel remained in the Port, a certificate of the medical examination being furnished to your Medical Officer daily. The vessel sailed from the Port of London for Middlesbrough on the 22nd December, and the circumstances were duly reported to the Medical Officer of Health of the latter Port for his information and guidance. HEALTH CERTIFICATES. There has been a considerable increase in the number of applications for Certificates of Health in respect of vessels that have come from " infected " ports. These vessels frequently bring cargo for transhipment to other countries, and in order that these goods may be landed at foreign ports, the owners have been asked to produce a Certificate, signed by your Medical Officer, that there has been no case of infectious disease on the vessel during the voyage to London. Several foreign countries also require that vessels coming from London, which have previously arrived from an "infected" port, should be disinfected by the Port Sanitary Authority, and produce a Certificate to that effect. This has been done in a large number of instances. A fee is charged both for the Health Certificate and for the Disinfection Certificate, the amount thus collected being duly credited to the Port Sanitary Account in the Chamber. 20 BERI-BERI. The recent Norwegian Commission inquiring into this somewhat mysterious disease has defined it as the Oriental name for an inflammation of the nerves, due to toxin poisoning by tainted vegetable or animal food-stuffs. The inquiries of the Royal Commission on Arsenical Poisoning, into the relation between Beri-beri and poisoning by arsenic, found the evidence insufficient to establish any connection, although in some instances traces of arsenic were found in preserved fish and food supplied to vessels making long voyages. It is probable that true Beri-beri is quite distinct from the symptoms produced by arsenical poisoning. During the course of the inquiry, the Commissioners were supplied through your Medical Officer with information of cases of Beri-beri on vessels arriving in the Port of London, with, when possible, samples of the food-stuffs used, or in use, by the persons affected. At the termination of the inquiry, the following letter was sent by the Secretary to the Royal Commission to the Town Clerk:— Royal Commission on Arsenical Poisoning, "8, Delahay Street, Westminster, S.W. "25th June, 1903. " Sir, " I am directed by Lord Kelvin to inform you that, as the Commission are now terminating their inquiry, it will no longer be necessary to " ask that information and samples in the case of ships arriving at the " Port of London with cases of Beri-beri on board should in future be " sent to them. " I am to add at the same time that the Commission have greatly " appreciated the assistance which has been given them in their inquiry " by the Port Medical Officer of Health and his Staff, and I am directed " to express their thanks to the Port of London Sanitary Authority for " the various data and material which have kindly been supplied to " them during the past year. "I am, Sir, " Your obedient Servant, " The Town Clerk, " (Signed) G. J. BUCHANAN. " (Port of London Sanitary Authority,) " Guildhall, E.C." 21 SMALL-POX. There has been no epidemic of this disease in London during 1903. The total number of cases reported on vessels was thirteen. Eleven of these were admitted to the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton. On 13th January a notification was received that there was a case of Smallpox on board the s.s. "Lady Martin," which was on the point of sailing for Dublin, The vessel was visited by your Medical Officer, who confirmed the diagnosis, and the vessel was stopped at Gravesend on the way down. The patient was landed with his effects, and the crew's effects and quarters were thoroughly disinfected. Vaccination was offered to every person on board, but only accepted in the case of three persons. The vaccination was carried out by your Medical Officer. As the vessel was to call at several ports along the coast on her way to Dublin, the facts were notified at once to the various Medical Officers of Health at the ports to be touched at by the vessel on her way to Dublin. The s.s. " Beatrice " arrived at Gravesend on the 12th March, having left Bombay on the 6th February. A case of suspected Small-pox was landed at Port Said on the 22nd February, and on arrival at Gravesend three cases were reported, and in the course of medical inspection one of the stewards was found suffering from a very mild attack of the complaint. All these men were removed to the Hospital, where one man has since died. The s.s. "Caledonia," of Greenock, arrived at Gravesend from Bombay on the 27th March, and landed a case of Small-pox at the Hospital. The patient, a native, was taken ill on the 21st March. The vessel and effects were thoroughly disinfected by your Officers. The remainder of the cases will be found in Appendix A. ENTERIC FEVER. In all, 88 cases of this disease have been reported during the year, whilst 55 cases have been treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton. The remarkable incident of the conveyance of this disease from the field of military operations in South Africa to a training ship in the Port of London, and generally to the country, is of such interest that I relate the circumstances here at length. On April 5th I received a notification that two cases of Enteric Fever had occurred on the training ship "Cornwall," and on April 9th a further two cases were notified. 22 The vessel is situated off Purfleet, and about five miles below the main sewage outfall of the London County Council at Crossness. It would appear from the stage of the illness, that these four boys were infected at, or about, the same time. No cases had occurred in the village of Purfleet. Enquiries were made on the vessel with a view to discovering the cause of the outbreak of this disease. It was found that the sanitary arrangements were somewhat imperfect, and that the water supply was obtained from the shore by means of a hose which was defective. Consequently, the water supplied to the vessel was probably slightly polluted with river water. On board, the water was filtered through charcoal and stored in tanks. Condensed milk was used on board, there were no shellfish layings in the vicinity of the vessel, and no history of the boys who were attacked having obtained or eaten any shellfish. Up to this point there appeared no cause for the outbreak. On my recommendation, new closets were at once supplied, a new hose obtained, and the use of the charcoal filters was discontinued. Your Medical Officer of Health being away on leave, Mr. G. C. Hancock, who was at the time Acting Medical Officer of Health for the Port, visited the vessel and obtained samples of the drinking water, one from the standpipe on the shore, and one from the water as stored on board. The chemical examination showed that the waters were good, so far as organic impurities were concerned, but both samples contained much common salt, and were also very hard. Bacterioscopic examination revealed, that the water taken from the standpipe on shore contained no bacillus coli or coli-like microbes, although it contained a larger number of bacteria generally. The water taken from the tank on board was distinctly polluted with comparatively numerous bacillus coli and coli-like microbes. During this time it was ascertained by Inspector Rolfe, who was conducting a personal sanitary inspection of the vessel, that there were some blankets on board which were reported to have come from South Africa. On enquiring into this it was ascertained that about 400 blankets were, on the 7th February, purchased from A. and B. These were Government blankets which had been returned from South Africa. It was also discovered that 28 of the blankets were distributed to the boys on the vessel on the 15th March, and an additional 29 were sent to the ship's hospital on shore. It was necessary that the blankets should be examined, with a view to ascertaining their precise 23 condition. As a precautionary measure, all the Government blankets on board were removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital for disinfection, and a bale of 25 blankets was sent to Dr. Klein. The inspection of the blankets at the Port Sanitary Disinfecting Station, and Dr. Klein's report on his examination of the same, revealed a very serious and dangerous condition of affairs. One hundred blankets were examined, and 98 of these were found to be soiled, in many cases with what appeared to be fecal matter, blood, and urine. In addition, lumps of dirt of various kinds and sizes were adherent to the blankets. Moreover, from their condition, it was obvious that the blankets had never been submitted to any process of cleansing or disinfection, and this surmise was fully confirmed by Dr. Klein's subsequent report. Dr. Klein's report with reference to blankets is as follows:— "St. Bartholomew's Hospital, " May 18th, 1903. " The Medical Officer of Health. " Blankets were delivered here on May 13th. Of these blankets fully "75 per cent. showed some kind of patches of dirt and large and " small discoloured stains. " A bacterioscopic analysis was made of some of the dirt, as also of " some of the stains, with the following result:— " (a.) Some of the dirt was paint. " (b.) Some of it was dried farinaceous material, probably arrowroot. " (c.) Some of it was distinctly fæcal matter, since in culture it " yielded abundance of bacillus coli and bacillus enteritidis " sporogenes. " (d.) Some of the stains looked like old stains of urine. Chemical " test for chlorides and for ammonia fully confirmed the " surmise. Bacterioscopic analysis of such stain, with the view " of discovering the presence of the bacillus typhosus (knowing " that the urine of typhoid patients in the later stages contains " this microbe, sometimes in great numbers), yielded highly " important results, viz., the cultures contained great abundance " of colonies, which in aspect and constitution corresponded to " the colonies of bacillus typhosus. " Agglutination test was made, subjecting an emulsion of some of the " above suspected colonies to the influence of blood serum of a " typhoid immunised rabbit. One part of this blood serum " added to forty parts of the emulsion of the suspected bacilli " caused striking and complete agglutination in ten to twenty " minutes. " I have made all necessary sub-cultures in order to definitely decide " the nature of the above colonies, but from the strikingly charac'' teristic aspect of the colonies, and from the decided nature of " the agglutination, I think it extremely probable that we are " dealing with the real bacillus typhosus. "E. KLEIN." 24 "St. Bartholomew's Hospital and College, " May 19th, 1903. "In continuation of yesterday's report I have to state that all further "tests made with the bacillus, which was considered yesterday as highly "probable to be bacillus typhosus, proved the microbe to be the true bacillus "typhosus. I do not remember whether I mentioned it, but I do so now, "viz., that two to three drops of the fluid emulsion of the stain on the "blanket that we examined yielded innumerable colonies of the bacillus " typhosus. "E. KLEIN." A letter, mentioning all the facts relating to the purchase of the blankets, and containing Dr. Klein's report, in full, on the bacterioscopic examination of the blankets, was sent to the Secretary of State for War. It was urged that the issue of blankets returned from South Africa should cease immediately, and that any blankets already issued should be recovered with a view to the disinfection of the same. The Under-Secretary of State for War stated that steps would be taken to prevent any further issue of the blankets, and he would ascertain as far as possible where those already issued had been sent. The blankets on the training ship "Cornwall" were purchased from Messrs. A. and B., who had obtained them from Messrs. C. and D. As it was extremely probable that these firms had large quantities of these blankets in store, and their premises being within the jurisdiction of the City of London, the facts were communicated to the Medical Officer of Health for the City, and as a result of the information supplied by your Medical Officer, large numbers of the blankets were traced to various parts of the kingdom, and were disinfected by the local authorities concerned. Enquiries were made on the other training ships lying in the River Thames, and it was ascertained that no blankets from South Africa had been purchased on their behalf. Further enquiries discovered bales of returned army blankets lying in the Docks. These were found to be in a more or less filthy condition, and were disinfected under the supervision of an officer of this Authority. The total number of cases of Enteric Fever which occurred on the training ship "Cornwall" was 15, extending over a period of 51 days. It will thus be seen that, although the bacterioscopic examination of the water supply indicated evidence of slight sewage contamination, yet had the infection been introduced by this source, it is more than probable that out of the 230 boys on board the vessel, a larger number than 15 would have been 25 infected, and they, moreover, would probably have been taken ill within a short period of one another. The patients ailed as follows:— Xo. of Case. 1 to 4. 30th March, 1903. 4 cases. 5 5th April, „ 1 case. 6 and 7. 9th ,, „ 2 cases. 8 21st „ „ 1 case. 9 and 10. 29th „ „ 2 cases. 11. 30th May „ 1 case. 12. 1st June „ 1 case. 13. 4th „ „ 1 case (fell in river 31/5/03). 14. 13th ,, „ 1 case. 15. 27th „ „ 1 case. The blankets were issued on March 15th, and it will be noted that four boys ailed 16 days later ; and that cases occurred at intervals until June 27th. The blankets were removed from the vessel on May 13th, and it is reasonable to infer that the cases, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, were infected about the same time. Some of these boys were engaged in the collection of the blankets, and possibly infected thereby. It must be borne in mind that at that time the blankets were not known to be capable of conveying infection, or the boys would not have been so employed. From a careful examination of the facts, I think there is little or no doubt that the infection of Enteric Fever was conveyed to the boys on the training ship by means of these blankets from South Africa, and an interesting addition to our knowledge of the epidemiology of this disease is supplied, fortunately without loss of life, so far as the boys on the training ship " Cornwall " were concerned. In connection with this subject it may be of interest to quote from my Report presented to the Port Sanitary Committee for the period ending 21st September, 1901:— "A case of Enteric Fever has recently been reported upon by the "Medical Officer of Health for Southwark, the patient being the son "of a soldier who died in South Africa from Enteric Fever. This "soldier's kit was sent home to his family, and the patient on unpacking "it found the linen soiled and apparently just as it had been taken "from his father's body. He wore some of the articles, and in a little "more than a week began to feel ill, and was discovered to be suffering "from Enteric Fever. Whether the assumption in this case be correct "or not, it is very important that articles of clothing sent home from "persons who have died in South Africa should be disinfected before "being despatched, and as many transports arrive in the Port of London. 26 "instructions have been given to your Inspectors to make careful "enquiries in every case as to the presence of deceased persons' effects "on board. "Your Worshipful Committee, at my suggestion, sent a communica"tion to the War Office Authorities pointing out this possible danger, "and urging that no effects from deceased persons should be allowed "to leave South Africa until they had been thoroughly disinfected." Had the representation of your Worshipful Committee received the careful consideration of the War Office Authorities, it is probable that this outbreak of Enteric Fever, and a great menace to the health of the country, would not have occurred. In all, seven of the boys from the training ship "Cornwall" were treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital. This was done at the request of the ship's authorities, and the expense of maintenance and treatment were borne by them. The Relation of Outbreaks of Enteric Fever to the Consumption of Shellfish Polluted with Sewage. This question has formed the subject of important discussions during the past year, with the result that in all probability legislation will, in the near future, be extended with a view to the protection of the public health from the danger arising out of the deposit or storage of edible shellfish in sewagepolluted waters. A prominent part in the investigation of the question has been taken by your Worshipful Committee, for the Port of London Sanitary Authority has within its jurisdiction a number of important shellfish layings and fisheries. These may be enumerated as follows:— On the Essex shore— Leigh Creek Cockles. Hadleigh Ray Oysters, Mussels, Periwinkles. River Roach Oysters. Maplin Sands Cockles. On the Kent shore— The Swale Oysters. Blythe Sands Cockles. At the beginning of the year I received from the Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth, through the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, information that several cases of Enteric Fever which had occurred within his district were, in his opinion, traceable to the consumption of cockles from Leigh in Essex. 27 In consequence of this information your Medical Officer visited Leigh-onSea on the 3rd January last, and in company with the Medical Officer of Health for that place made an investigation upon the spot. Leigh-on-Sea is situated on the shore of the Thames Estuary about 1½ miles to the westward of Southend-on-Sea, the western boundary of the Borough of Southend and the eastern boundary of the Urban District of Leigh being contiguous. Leigh has a population of nearly 4,000 persons (which is, of course, largely augmented during the summer season). During 1902, 43 cases of Enteric Fever occurred. The sewage of Leigh is filtered through coke breeze filter beds, the resultant effluent being discharged into Leigh Creek, about half-a-mile westward of Leigh Railway Station. Cockles are gathered from the Maplin and Blythe Sands, brought by boat to Leigh, where the practice is to place them in the Creek for a variable period in order to "purge themselves of the sand." Assuming the original gathering ground to be free from sewage pollution, storage of the cockles in Leigh Creek points to an obvious result, namely, while purging themselves of the sand of the gathering ground, they fill themselves with the sewage polluted mud and water of the Creek. Your Medical Officer collected samples of the cockles direct from the Creek, also samples of the mud and water. These were examined by Dr. Klein. His report is interesting and instructive; it was as follows:— St. Bartholomew's Hospital and College, January 7th, 1903. "1. One sample of water, labelled 'Water taken from Leigh Creek, low "tide, 11.30 a.m., 3rd December, 1902.' "2. One sample of mud and cockles from Leigh Creek, low tide, taken by "Medical Officer of Health, 3rd January, 1903. "These samples will be nominated :— "Water from Leigh Creek, "Mud from Leigh Creek, and "Cockles, No. 10, respectively. "A. Water.—This water contained at least ¼ million microbes per 1 cc. The "water contained abundance of bacillus coli communis and spores of bacillus "enteritidis sporogenes, of the latter at least 10 spores per 1 cc., of the former at "least 100 per 1 cc. "From this it follows that this water is practically dilute sewage. "B. Mud.—1 gramme of mud was distributed in 10 cc. of sterile water; after "allowing the mineral matter to settle, of the slightly turbid fluid, cc., ¼ cc., "and 1 cc. were used for demonstrating the presence of bacillus coli communis and 28 "the spores of the bacillus enteritidis sporogenes, and the result was practically the same as stated of the water, viz., abundance of bacillus coli communis and of "spores of bacillus enteritidis in 1/10 cc. "C. Cockles, No. 10.—Twelve of the cockles were used, only the exterior being "employed. The result was this :—All cockles contained the bacillus coli communis "and the spores of bacillus enteritidis. In one (possibly two) cockle, we isolated, "besides, a microbe, which, so far as was possible in the two days, answers to the "tests of typhoid bacillus, but, of course, this time is not sufficient to make a definite "statement on the subject. I may, however, add that typhoid blood agglutinates "the emulsion of the bacillus in question as 1 in 100, better, of course, as 1 in 50. "E. KLEIN." Subsequently Dr. Klein reported that the typhoid bacillus, or, at any rate, a bacillus corresponding to it and answering all tests of the bacilli typhosus, was discovered in these cockles. These investigations were contemporary with others carried out on behalf of the Public Health Department of the City and the Fishmongers' Company. The results which have been published in every case pointed to the same danger, and while immediate steps were taken to prohibit the sale in London of shellfish from this source, your Committee proceeded to personally inspect the various sewage outfalls in the Thames Estuary within your jurisdiction. The first inspection of this kind took place on the 25th February, and comprised the oyster layings in Stangate Creek, the sewage outfalls of Sheerness at West Minster, the Naval Hospital, School of Gunnery, and Garrison Point Fort, also an outfall from the Royal Dockyard at Rats Bay. Your Committee observed the pollution in the immediate neighbourhood of some of these outfalls, and witnessed the collection of shellfish from the foreshore within a quarter of a mile of the outfall of a sewer. The importance of the subject at once became manifest. On the 10th March your Committee proceeded to the Barrow Deeps and witnessed the operation of discharging sludge from the vessels of the London County Council. On the 29th April your Committee proceeded to Leigh-on-Sea and received a deputation of Cocklers and Fishermen. Subsequently an inspection was made of the cockle layings and the preparation of the cockles for market, previously described. As a result of these investigations, it was recommended to and approved by the Court of Common Council that the Corporation as the Port Sanitary Authority should offer to give evidence before the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal. 29 This was done, your Medical Officer giving evidence before the Commission in July at considerable length. The evidence was directed to exhibit certain defects in existing legislation and control in the matter of the cultivation and sale of edible shellfish. For instance, your Medical Officer pointed out that the Sections of the Public Health Act relating to unsound food could not be made applicable to shellfish inasmuch as action could only be taken on the results of a bacterioscopic examination. That the Port Sanitary Authority should be granted powers to enter upon and inspect shellfish grounds, and if polluted, to prohibit further laying of shellfish there. That the discharge of sewage into the waters of the Estuary in proximity to shellfish grounds is dangerous to the public health, and that crude sewage should be so treated that this danger would be minimised or abolished altogether. That the Corporation as the Port Sanitary Authority was the proper body to exercise the powers required, it possessed the requisite machinery, and from its constitution was entitled to the confidence of the shellfish trade. At the present time the only powers possessed by the Port Sanitary Authority were under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891-99, the Nuisance Clauses and those relating to unsound food. On the question as to the extent of pollution caused by London sewage, your Medical Officer expressed his opinion that on the practical question of danger to the public health the outfall at Barking was in no way comparable with the local pollution in the vicinity *of Southend ; that, in fact, sewage acts prejudicially in proportion to the vicinit+y of the outfall to the shellfish beds. That the proper treatment of sewage would tend to greatly minimise the danger, and that if a sewage effluent were produced chemically pure and bacteriologically freer from organisms generally than crude sewage, the danger would be diminished proportionately. On the subject of the constitution of dangerous pollution, although this might be defined as the extent to which it was shown bacteriologically that pollution existed, yet the actual extent of pollution taking place by personal observation must also at the same time be considered. That, eliminating local pollution, it was probable that no material danger would accrue to shellfish at Southend from the effluent at Barking. That the Corporation would be the best Authority to control the pollution of the Estuary of the Thames, and that it would fulfil all the requirements considered necessary in the case of a Rivers Board. 30 Except as to the constitution of the proposed Authority for the control of shell fisheries, the recommendations of the Royal Commission embodied in their Report followed closely the suggestions put forward in evidence by your Medical Officer, as the following extracts will show :— The law on the subject may be summed up thus : "generally speaking, "the statute law does not prohibit the discharge of filthy liquids into tidal "waters," but the Local Government Board may make an Order extending the provisions of the Rivers Pollution Act, 1876, to tidal water, or the Sea Fisheries Committee may make bye-laws for " prohibiting or regu"lating the deposit or discharge of any substance detrimental to sea-fish or "sea-fishing," subject to the approval of the Board of Trade. The Commission are satisfied that injuries to health and to fisheries may be caused by the discharge of unpurified sewage in tidal waters, and that some alteration of the law is required. They also have no doubt that shellfish which have become contaminated by sewage may convey Enteric Fever and other illness to human beings if eaten either raw or in an imperfectly cooked condition, and that there can be no doubt that the evil is sufficiently grave to demand a remedy. The remedies suggested may be divided into three general classes:— (1) Purification of the sewage before its discharge into tidal waters. In the interim Report dated July, 1901, the Commission pointed out that effluents from sewage farms, as well as effluents from artificial purifying processes, must be regarded as potentially dangerous, inasmuch as they may still contain disease organisms, and that in such cases, either the sewage outfall must be removed or the layings closed. (2) Seizure and destruction of unwholesome shellfish exposed for sale. They think that the provisions of the Public Health Act are practically useless for preventing the sale of contaminated shellfish. In paragraph 38, the opinion is expressed that no general enactment as to treatment of sewage, or as to seizure of unwholesome food, would meet the necessities of the case. The remedy must be sought in connection with the waters, foreshores, pits, ponds and layings themselves. (3) The setting up of a competent Authority to deal with all tidal waters, with power to control foreshores, and to close dangerous beds, pits, ponds and layings, and in certain circumstances to require treatment of sewage. 31 They are strongly of opinion that the only way in which this evil can be effectively dealt with is by placing tidal waters in the jurisdiction of some competent authority, and conferring upon that authority power to prevent the taking of shellfish for human consumption from any position where liable to risk of dangerous contamination, and to enforce restrictions as regards pollution, and as regards waters, foreshores, beds, pits, ponds and layings in which shellfish are fattened or stored. The case of each river and estuary is a problem by itself. They also accept the view that at present the results of bacteriological examinations must be interpreted in the light of topographical observations. The question which I have submitted for the consideration of your Worshipful Committee is, as to who should be the controlling authority for the shellfish layings situated in the Thames and Thames Estuary. The Commission state that the case of each river and estuary is a problem by itself, and in connection with this I would point out that the Port of London Sanitary Committee have been interesting themselves in this question since the year 1897, when this question first came into prominence, and was the subject of investigation and report by Dr. Bulstrode, an Inspector of the Local G-overnment Board. The Chairman of the Committee and Medical Officer gave evidence in 1899 before the Committee of the House of Loris considering the Oyster Bill brought out in that year, and urging that the controlling body should be the Port of London Sanitary Authority. The Authority possesses the necessary Staff, with Launches. It is a body sufficiently large to be impartial, and not to be influenced by personal or local conditions. It is not the Authority for the disposal of London sewage, and it has since the year 1872 (on the constitution of this Authority) carried out its work at its own expense. In order to deal satisfactorily with the subject, it would be necessary for the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority to be considerably extended, and in connection with this, I would point out that in 1872 the limits of the Port of London extended as far Eastward as a line drawn from the North Foreland in Kent to the Naze in Essex. This would include all estuaries in which the most famous oyster layings of the United Kingdom are situated. TYPHUS FEVER. One case of this comparatively rare disease was reported during the year as follows:— The s.s. "Hibernian," of Glasgow, from Buenos Ayres, arrived at Gravesend on the 29th May via Dunkirk. One of the crew who had been ashore in 32 Dunkirk, where the vessel lay from the 24th to the 28th May, left the vessel in London on the 30th and proceeded to his home at Govan, where he arrived on the 31st May. He was taken ill the same day, and was seen by the Medical Officer of Health for Govan. On the 10th June he was found to be suffering from Typhus Fever and removed to hospital. On receipt of this information I had the crew's quarters of the vessel thoroughly fumigated and disinfected. After this had been done, the quarters were painted out with two coats of paint. No further cases of illness have been reported. TRAINING SHIPS. With the exception of the epidemic of Enteric Fever on the "Cornwall," referred to in my notes under the heading of Infectious Disease, the year has been a healthy one so far as these ships are concerned. For years past there has been an epidemic of Diphtheria on the Training Ship "Warspite." It is interesting, therefore, to observe from the subjoined Table that during 1903 there has been, with the exception of one solitary case, an entire absence of this disease from the vessel. This fact, in my opinion, in itself amply justifies and confirms the action of your Committee in urging the removal of the vessel from its old berth at Woolwich to the lower reaches of the River. The following cases of Infectious Disease were reported during the year:— TABLE VI. Name of Vessel. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Scarlet Fever. Erysipelas. Total.

Totals 2 21 2 1 26 33 ALIEN IMMIGRATION. The Report of the Royal Commission appointed to investigate the import of Alien Immigration has been issued during the year. Your Medical Officer gave evidence before the Commission on the following points:— "(1) The methods employed in respect of Aliens on arrival in the Port of "London. "Under this heading it was shown that the majority of Alien Immigrants "arrived in London from four ports, namely, those of Rotterdam, Bremen, "Hamburg and Libau. "The vessels from Libau sail under the Danish flag, and on these vessels "the accommodation provided for emigrants was grossly deficient as regards "ventilation, lighting and cleanliness, and there was no provision for separating "the sexes, and lavatories, water-closets, &c., were used in common. "Four steamers sail each week from Hamburg, three from Rotterdam and "one from Libau. "That the Alien Immigrant was subjected, on arrival, to a modified medical "examination by one of the Medical Officers appointed by the Corporation of "the City of London, and stationed at Gravesend, who visits the vessel and "ascertains whether any sickness is, or has been, on board. If any sickness is "reported, the Medical Officer proceeds on board and examines the patients, "and if a case of infectious disease is discovered, the vessel is moored, and the "patient detained and landed at Denton Hospital. The remaining passengers "are examined, and if there is no risk of their spreading disease, are allowed "to land on giving their names and addresses of destination. "Under certain circumstances special medical examination takes place, as, "for instance, if vessels arrive from ports at which the exotic diseases of "Plague, Yellow Fever or Cholera are known or suspected to exist, they are "boarded and the passengers medically examined. "The Medical Officer does not at the present time inspect or deal with "passengers on the sole ground that they are in a dirty condition in respect "of their persons or clothing. "(2) The condition of Aliens on arrival. That it was important to consider the personal condition of the Alien "Immigrants on their arrival, of (a) health, (b) cleanliness, (c) means of "subsistence. 34 "The general health of Alien Immigrants was shown to be fairly good, and "the number of cases of infectious disease introduced by them were not "numerous. "It would be incorrect to say that much infectious disease had come into "the country by these people. "In many cases the condition of the passengers, on arrival, with regard to "cleanliness, was very deficient; they were more or less dirty and generally "verminous both in their bodies and clothing. "The Commissioners recommended:— "(1) That the immigration of certain classes of Aliens into this "country be subjected to State control and regulation to the extent "hereinafter mentioned. "(2) That a Department of Immigration be established, either in con"nection with the Board of Trade and Local Government Board or of "an independent character. "(3) That improved methods be employed to secure correct statistical "returns relating to Alien Immigration. That for this purpose the Act "of William IV., cap. 11, be repealed, and power given by statute to the "Board of Trade to make provision by regulations for obtaining from "shipowners returns of the numbers and nationalities of all Aliens "entering or departing from the United Kingdom, and such farther "information as may be thought desirable, These regulations to apply "to all or any specified ports, and to be subject to such conditions or "modifications as may appear expedient. "(4) That legislative power be obtained for the purpose of carrying "out the following suggestions:— "(a) The Immigration Department to have the power of making "and enforcing orders and regulations which may be made applicable "to immigration generally, or to vessels arriving at or from certain "ports, or to certain classes of immigrants. "(b) That a sufficient staff of officers be appointed by the Immi"gration Department to carry into effect the provisions of this Act, "and the orders and regulations made under it. "(c) Power shall be conferred upon such officers to make such "inquiry as may be possible from the immigrants upon their arrival "as to their character and condition, and if such officer shall have "reason to think that any immigrant comes within any of the classes "mentioned as ' undesirables,' viz., criminals, idiots, lunatics, prosti"tutes, persons of notoriously bad character, or likely to become a "charge upon the public funds, he shall report the case, with such "particulars as he can give, to the Immigration Department. 35 "(g) Such orders and regulations to include provision for medical "examination of Alien Immigrants at the port of arrival. In cases "where an immigrant is found to be suffering from infectious or "loathsome disease, or mental incapacity, the Medical Officer to have "power to debar such immigrant from landing, and the shipowner to "be compelled to re-convey the emigrant to the port of embarkation. "(h) Immigrants on arrival to give the information demanded "from them, refusal, or the giving of false information, to be an "offence under the Act, with penalty and discretionary power of "repatriation at expense of Shipping Company. "It seems not improbable that the publication of this Report, and the "prospect of restrictive legislation, may cause those who intend to emigrate to "anticipate the proposed restrictions, and thus lead to an immediate and "immoderate increase of immigration. "We are impressed with the necessity of avoiding, as far as possible, such a "result of our labours ; and we would venture to submit the immediate adop"tion of such of our recommendations as can be introduced without recourse to "Parliament. At the same time we clearly recognise that the complete "enforcement of the system we propose is only possible by legislation." It will be noticed that among the recommendations are two Avhich are intimately connected with the work of this Authority. The first recommends that such Orders and Regulations should include provision for medical examination of Alien Immigrants at the port of arrival. When the epidemic of Cholera broke out at Hamburg in 1892, cases of Cholera were detected on board ships arriving in London amongst immigrants who had come from Hamburg. In accordance with the Local Government Board Order all such vessels were carefully inspected, and this system of inspection was continued until the summer of 1895. All Jewish immigrants coming into the Port of London were kept under control by the Officers of the Port Sanitary Authority. They were first inspected at Gravesend; a notice was served on the master of the vessel requiring him to keep them on board until they were liberated by an Officer of this Authority. By an arrangement made with the Committee of the Jewish Shelter, a responsible official of that Committee visited the ship on arrival, and personally conducted these immigrants to the Jewish Shelter. Thence they were conducted to various addresses in London; the date of departure from the shelter, together with the names and addresses of those leaving it, 36 were forwarded to your Medical Officer each day. Thus it was found practicable to keep these immigrants under observation on their arrival in London. Your Officers have therefore had much experience in dealing with such immigrants, the machinery exists, and can be put in action immediately if required. I therefore recommend that, should an Alien Immigration Bill be introduced into Parliament, steps be taken to ensure that this Authority should be responsible for the medical examination of immigrants, and for this purpose, that powers to enter vessels on arrival at Gravesend,and also to detain vessels for such reasonable time as may be required for the medical examination, should be obtained. The Immigration Officer of the Board of Trade, who enquires into the immigrant's social and financial position, can at the same time carry out his duties. Statutory powers should be obtained for regulating the accommodation upon, and condition of, various immigrant passenger ships. Notwithstanding the fact that the present statutory powers are very insufficient for dealing with this question, yet your Committee have made strong representations to the Consuls-General of Denmark and Russia, with the result that many of these vessels have undergone structural alterations in the way of lighting, ventilation, and improved bunks ; but the fact remains that these vessels were never constructed for the purpose of carrying immigrants, and although, as the result of your Committee's representations, considerable improvement has been made, these vessels are still kept under close observation with a view to the improvement being maintained. The obligations under the Merchant Shipping Act only apply to vessels under the British Flag. Foreign vessels trading to ports in this country should conform to the requirements of this Act, and not be treated preferentially, to the prejudice of British Shipping. CONDITION OF THE WATER IN THE RIVER AND DOCKS. The condition of the water of the River and of the Docks has remained satisfactory throughout the year. Low temperatures and abundant rainfall have no doubt been largely responsible for this. On this subject I cannot do better than quote from the Report of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal relative to the biological composition of the water of the river as investigated for the purposes of their Inquiry:— "As a result of these investigations, we find that, as judged by the "bacillus coli test, the River Thames at Mucking, about 20 miles below "the Barking and Crossness Outfall Works, is at times as pure as the "River Thames in the region of Sunbury and Hampton, above the intakes "of some of the London waterworks companies. 37 "As regards change in the biological composition of the water in the "River Thames from Barking and Crossness downwards towards the "open waters of the estuary, all that need be said is, that whereas at "Barking and Crossness the number of bacillus coli per c.c. of water varied usually from 100 to 1,000, no appreciable improvement was "noticeable at Purfleet (about 5 miles below Crossness), but slight "improvement at Grays (about ten miles below Crossness), and that it is "not until Mucking (20 miles below Crossness) is reached that the "quality of the water is so far improved as to vie with the water in the "Upper Thames at Sun bury and Hampton. At Mucking the number of "bacillus coli per c.c. varies usually from 1 to 10, and about five miles "lower down (at the Chapman Light) it is so far improved that about "one-half of the samples contained only one-tenth of this amount. "It will be seen that, notwithstanding the daily discharge in dry "weather into the Thames at Barking and Crossness of 230,000,000 "gallons of treated sewage, each cubic centimetre of which contains "about 100,000 bacillus coli, and the daily discharge of 7,000 tons of "sludge into the Barrow Deep, each gramme of which may contain over "a million bacillus coli, one-half of the samples of water at Chapman "Light (about 25 miles below Crossness) and in Barrow Deep were not "found to contain one bacillus coli per cubic centimetre." FOOD INSPECTION. Table VII. is a summary of the quantities of unsound food destroyed or otherwise disposed of in order to prevent the sale or use of the same for the food of man. No large seizures of unsound meat have been made. This, of course, means that cargoes of frozen meat have on the whole arrived and been landed in good condition. The quantity of frozen meat imported during the year was reduced as from Australia, but largely increased imports were received from New Zealand and the Argentine Republic. According to returns issued by the Meat Trade, the import of frozen mutton and lamb into the United Kingdom from all sources during 1903 showed an increase of 960,380 carcasses over the aggregate of the previous year. "This marks the greatest expansion which has taken place in any one year since the trade commenced." The increased import of frozen mutton and lamb into the Port of London during 1903 amounted to 936,448 carcasses, or 97.5 per cent. of the total increase of trade. 38 TABLE VII. Original packages.

Victoria Dock 315,000 carcasses. „ (Extension) 180,000 „ West India Dock 90,000 „ South West India Dock 13,000 ,, London Central Markets:— Poplar Riverside Store 200,000 „ On the 24th April last an Inquiry was opened at the Old Council Chamber, Guildhall, by an Inspector of the Local Government Board, for the purpose of receiving evidence on the question of the proposed extension of the jurisdiction of the Corporation as the Port of London Sanitary Authority in the matter of unsound food, by the inclusion of wharves forming part of, or abutting on, the Port. As is now well known, this Inquiry was the outcome of a movement on the part of the Dock Companies in order to ensure, as they alleged, uniformity of inspection of unsound food in the Port of London. It was alleged by the Dock Company that the inspection of food in the docks was, very properly, minute and strict, but, that at the riverside wharves within the districts of the various Metropolitan District Councils, articles of food were not subjected to so close an inspection, and that as a result they had suffered loss of trade by the removal of some of their business from the docks to riverside wharves. A list of the wharves abutting on the River within the jurisdiction of the Authority at which food stuffs can be landed is appended. (Appendix E.) It was pointed out to the Inspector, on behalf of the Corporation, that there was no desire on their part to extend their present jurisdiction, but that if this were done, it would, of course, be undertaken and carried out in an efficient manner. The Inquiry was attended by representatives of all the Metropolitan District Councils possessed of foreshore in the Port of London, most of whom gave evidence. The result of the Inquiry was, that it was not shown to be desirable at the present time to make any alteration in the existing limits of jurisdiction. The provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to unsound food, have been found inadequate in many respects by your Officers. When this Act was drafted, it was not contemplated that seizures would be made on a large and wholesale scale. 1 note the Public Health Acts are likely to be amended, and I recommend that the Committee should bring to the notice of the Local Government Board these defects, with a view to the Public Health Act being amended as may be considered necessary. 41 TABLE IX.

In Table IX. is shown the total number of nuisances reported and dealt with during the year, with an analysis of the same. From this Table it will be seen that the total number of nuisances of all kinds reported during the year was 1,045. Of this number 266 were smoke nuisances, 629 had reference to dilapidations or structural defects, 75 were in respect of insanitary barges, 54 were accumulations of offensive matter, and 29 were infringements of the Bye-laws of the Port Sanitary Authority relating to Offensive Cargoes. In addition there were complaints of certain foul and offensive lighters, public conveniences, and miscellaneous nuisances. Smoke Nuisances. Close attention has been given to this class of nuisance, and, as stated, 266 complaints have been dealt with during the year. Legal proceedings were taken in five cases,which are detailed in Appendix H. Convictions were obtained in four cases, the defendant in one case, namely, that of the steam tug " Richmond," gave notice of appeal, and the fifth case was adjourned pending the result of the appeal. The case of the "Richmond" is important, and raised the whole question of the power of the Port Sanitary Authority to take action against the owners of steam vessels, under Section 24 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The case was heard by the Lord Mayor, sitting at the Mansion House Justice Room, on 24th September. The owners of the tug being summoned for that on the 24tb August, 1903, between Custom House and Southwark Bridge, on the North side of the River Thames in the said City and within the Port of London, upon a certain vessel, to wit, the s.s. " Richmond," of London, 95,485, the following nuisance existed, namely, a chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, and that the defendant being the Owner of the said vessel had made default in complying with the requisitions of a Notice, dated 25th day of April, 1903, served upon him under Section 24 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requiring him to abate the nuisance and to execute such works and to do such things as might be necessary for that purpose, contrary to the Statute. It was contended by the defendant— (1) That Section 24 of the said Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was inapplicable to a steam tug such as the "Richmond," while plying to and fro on the River Thames. 43 (2) That the "Richmond," on the said 24th August, was not a vessel lying within the district of the said Port Sanitary Authority within the meaning of Article III. of an Order of the Local Government Board dated 25th March, 1892, and made under Section 112 of the said Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (3) That if, by reason of such Order of the Local Government Board, the said Section 24 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was applicable to a vessel used as the said steam tug was being used on the said 24th August, 1903, then the proceedings under such section should have been taken against the master of the said vessel, and not against the Appellant. (4) That proceedings in respect to smoke from vessels plying on the River Thames can only be taken under the provisions of Section 23 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The case was adjourned until the 9th October last, when the Lord Mayor convicted the defendant and fined him One Pound and One Guinea costs. From this conviction he appealed, the Lord Mayor stating a case for the decision of the High Court. The Appellant further contended that the funnel of a steam tug was not a chimney within the meaning of Section 24 ; and further, that he required the Magistrate to specify the works to be executed to prevent any recurrence of the nuisance, which the Lord Mayor was of opinion he was not bound so to specify. Judgment in the appeal was given while this Report was in the press, and is appended.* *The Lord Chief Justice, in giving judgment,said that the Magistrate's decision was right,though the point had admitted of argument. On first reading the section one might think that it was intended to apply to chimneys on land. But when one looked at the object of the legislation and at certain expressions in Section 24 of the Act, he thought that any such construction would be too narrow. So far as the first part of the section was concerned, it was essentially a " black smoke " section. Section 23 (3) dealt specifically with steam engines and furnaces on steamers, and provided that they should be constructed so as to consume the smoke. These sections showed that there were special provisions with regard to the construction of furnaces and engines on steamers, and the non-negligent user of them. But it was to be observed that there was a corresponding provision in regard to furnaces on land, namely, Section 23 (1), and there was a corresponding provision in regard to non-negligent user. Section 24 was a " nuisance " section, and it was not without importance that it immediately followed Section 23. If the words could be fairly applied to a chimney on board a steamship, there was no reason why they should not be so applied ; for unless the words " any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house) " showed that a steamship could not be included, the object of the legislation would be avoided by not so applying them. There might be cases where the black smoke would come from a chimney which would, in ordinary language, be called a funnel. But he did not think that any argument could be based on the fact that the word " chimney " was used, for " funnel " was only the technical name for a particular kind of chimney. He did not see why the emission of black smoke from the funnels of vessels on the Thames should not be prevented as well as from chimneys on land. Section 24 was not sufficient to enable the Court to hold that the funnel of a steamship was not a chimney. As to the other point, the order was not bad because it did not specify any works to be executed (although the defendant asked that they should be specified), for there were no works that could be executed. Mr. Justice Kennedy, in agreeing, said that the question was whether Section 24 (b) included the funnel of a tug. Usually" chimney " was a word applicable to the passage through which smoke passed from a fire in a building, and technically it was not a proper term to describe those passages on a steamboat which were used to convey the smoke from the furnaces to the outer air. But he saw nothing to prevent " chimney " being used in what he might call its natural sense, namely, a passage by which smoke from a fire was carried away upwards. Otherwise there would be no " black smoke " section with regard to a description of thing that might send out smoke in quantities enough to create a nuisance. Mr. Justice Channell delivered judgment to the same effect. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. 44 Nuisances (General). The total number of dilapidations and structural defects reported was 629, this number involving structural alterations and repairs on 541 vessels, &c., while the total number of structural alterations and repairs known to have been carried out was 510, or 81.08 per cent. of the total number ordered. In the case of insanitary barges, 75 nuisances were reported. In 57 cases Statutory Notice was given, and only nine recurrences were reported. Police Court proceedings were taken in five cases of smoke nuisances, and in one case of infringement of the Bye-laws of the Port Sanitary Authority relating to Offensive Cargoes (see Appendix H). It will be seen that these nuisances necessitated the issue and service of 959 written intimations, and Statutory Notices. It should be noted with regard to " written intimations," that the primary warning only is referred to. Table IX., which is now presented for the first time, forms an interesting and improved abstract of the work of the Authority in the abatement of nuisances. Barges with Offensive Cargoes. The question of the welfare of persons employed on barges engaged in carrying offensive cargoes has received, during the past year, considerable attention at the hands of your Officers. In my last Annual Report I referred to this subject, and recommended strongly that barges should be brought within the scope of operation of the Canal Boats Act. If this were done they would have to comply with the requirements of the Canal Boats Acts and the Regulations made thereunder, the most important of which would be compulsory registration and the provision of a double water-tight bulkhead in those barges carrying offensive cargoes, e.g., house refuse, stable manure, and road sweepings. The construction of these barges usually is as follows : Each barge consists of a fore-cabin, hold, and an after-cabin. The fore-cabin is generally used for stores, and is only occasionally used. The after-cabin, which is approached by a companion ladder, is occupied by the master and crew, which usually consists of one person besides himself. It is frequently the practice of the master during the summer months to be accompanied by his wife and children, and then it is assumed that the other member of the crew sleeps in the forecabin. These cabins are separated from the hold by a single bulkhead, which only extends as far as the inner skin of the vessel at the side and to the floor of the cabin, so that it is possible for offensive liquids, gases, &c., to pass from the hold through the space between the two skins of the vessel and under the cabin floor into the cabin, and it is usually found that the space under the cabin floor contains a variable quantity of more or less filthy and offensive liquid. It has frequently been observed when carrying house refuse, especially in the summer time, the stench in the cabin is unbearable, whilst maggots and 45 insects crawl from the cargo into the cabin and into the bunks there.The bulkhead is also frequently defective, and occasionally also a doorway exists, more or less ill-fitting, which allows offensive liquid and gases,to pass into the cabin from the hold. It is thus clear that in the majority of vessels carrying these offensive cargoes there exists conditions constituting a serious nuisance, not only injurious to health, but even dangerous to life. The following deaths from suffocation, on barges carrying offensive cargoes, have come under the notice of your Officers during the last four years:— On the 30th January, 1900, the ketch "Susie," of Littlehampton, 75,233, lying off Silvertown, laden with a cargo of "saccharine scum," was boarded by one of your Inspectors, who, on opening the companion, found the dead bodies of the Master of the vessel and his wife. At a coroner's inquest, held at Woolwich on the 2nd February, 1900, it was proved that the couple had been suffocated in their sleep by the fumes from the cargo entering the cabin. On the 29th July, 1900, two men were found dead in the after-cabin of the barge " Webster," of Rochester, 47,949, lying at Wakeley's Wharf, Southwark, laden with dung and vegetable refuse. At the coroner's inquest, held at Southwark on the 1st August, the jury found that the men came by their deaths in the cabin of the barge by "accidental suffocation due to impure air," and made the following rider: "That, in the opmion of the jury, barges "conveying manure and other impure cargoes should be specially constructed." On the 27th September, 1901, the Master of the barge "Herbert Tomkins," off Blackfriars, was found dead in the after-cabin, having been, as the evidence at the subsequent inquest clearly showed, suffocated by the carbonic acid gas evolved from the cargo, which consisted of refuse from streets, stables, vegetable markets and breweries. The cabin of the barge was inspected by your Medical Officer. The air was so impure that a match would not burn in any situation lower than three feet from the cabin floor. On the 1st July, 1903, in the West India Dock, the insensible body of the Master of the barge " William Hordle," of Rochester, was found in the forecabin of the barge. Assistance being obtained, he was with difficulty, owing to the foul condition of the air in the cabin, taken out, and on medical assistance being obtained, the man was found to be dead. At the subsequent inquest, the verdict was given as one of death from natural causes. The opinion of your Inspector, together with the evidence of the men who went into the cabin, and who were nearly overcome by the foul gases, shows 46 that if the Master was not actually suffocated, yet the air in the cabin was in such a condition that it was impossible for anyone to have lived in it for even a short time. On the 8th July, 1903, the Master of the barge " Alert," lying in the Millwall Dock, laden with manure, was found dead in the fore-cabin of the barge, under precisely similar conditions as obtained in the case of the "William Hordle." The verdict of the coroner's jury was also one of death from natural causes. These facts were reported to the Board of Trade, and they were asked to co-operate with your Worshipful Committee in this important matter, whilst in the meantime action was taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Your Committee have during the past year served upon various owners of this class of barge 57 Statutory Notices requiring not only the abatement of the nuisances, but the prevention of the recurrence thereof. The legal position has been tested in the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction, and a conviction has been obtained in each of the cases taken there. The alterations ordered are reported to have been carried out on a total of 112 barges during a period of about three years, and, except in two cases where the work had been carried out in an imperfect and unsatisfactory manner, the nuisance has been abated and has not recurred. When a Statutory Notice under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, has been served by order of your Worshipful Committee, proceedings can only be taken should the nuisance not be abated within the prescribed period allowed, or, when abated, it has been allowed to recur. This constitutes the offence, and legal proceedings must be taken within a period of six months following the time specified in the Statutory Notice for the abatement or prevention of recurrence of the nuisance. A barge so offending may not be seen for six months by your Inspectors ; may have been laid up ; may not have been engaged in carrying cargoes of an offensive nature ; or, when seen, the nuisance may have been abated by clearing out the space under the cabin floor. It should be borne in mind that the nuisance and danger to health exist chiefly during the time the cargo is carried. These barges trade to various places in the Thames Estuary, and get "under weigh" as soon as possible after being loaded, and unless anchored, it is not practically possible for your Officers to get on board and inspect the conditions on board. Thus much of the work of your Officers is rendered inoperative, and the serving of repeated Notices only, without summoning the offenders, leads to no 47 practical result in improving the conditions under which the crews on barges carrying offensive cargoes have to live. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, seems to me to provide a remedy for this difficulty. Section 5 (b) states that if the nuisance, although abated since the service of the Notice, is, in the opinion of the Sanitary Authority, likely to recur on the same premises, the Sanitary Authority shall make a complaint, and the Petty Sessional Court hearing the complaint may make on such person a summary order. It will, I think, be admitted that barges carrying offensive cargoes in which the crew's quarters are not absolutely cut off from the hold so as to effectually prevent the discharge of filthy liquids or effluvium or gases, the nuisance is not only likely, but certain to recur whenever such offensive cargoes are carried. I therefore recommend that the opinion of Mr. Solicitor be taken on this point, and that, if he approves, legal proceedings should be taken in future against the owners of the barges carrying offensive cargoes in those cases where they do not carry out the necessary works to prevent a recurrence of the nuisance within a reasonable time. There is a similar class of vessel engaged in the carrying of dangerous and explosive cargoes from the Port of London, which, I think, might fairly be brought within the scope of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. I quote extracts from the Reports of H.M. Inspector of Explosives. In his report of an explosion on a ketch which sailed from the Thames for the port of Kingston-on-Hull, and in which latter port the explosion occurred, resulting m the loss of the ketch and considerable damage to surrounding property, from which it will be seen that the hold was not effectually cut off from the crew's quarters:— "From the commencement of the voyage the leakage from the barrels "appears to have been considerable, and petroleum vapour was passing in "considerable quantities into all parts of the vessel, so much was this the "case that the crew were unable at any time to sleep below decks, and "were obliged to make use of the boat for the purpose. It is also a significant fact that the ship's cat was found suffocated in the forecastle "on the second day of the voyage." In another case in which the explosion at sea resulted in loss of life, the same Inspector reports: "That the vapour had penetrated into the forecastle to "such an extent as to prevent its use." The two deaths which occurred in the West India and Millwall Docks were brought to the notice of your Worshipful Committee in my monthly Reports, and on the recommendation of your Medical Officer the facts were reported to the Board of Trade, and they were asked to co-operate with this Authority in dealing with this question. 48 At the request of the Board of Trade, your Medical Officer had a conference with the Principal Officer of the Board of Trade in December last on this subject, and explained that the position of the Port Sanitary Authority was that of dealing with a nuisance on the barges, arising from filthy liquid and foul gases passing from the holds of the barges into the crew space ; that the Port Sanitary Authority required the nuisance abated and its recurrence prevented by the carrying out of the alterations suggested by this Authority. Your Medical Officer explained that on re-inspection of barges on which such alterations had been carried out efficiently, no nuisance had been found to exist. The Principal Officer explained that the three Surveyors working under him had each advised a different method of preventing a nuisance on the barges, and, as far as 1 was able to judge the different methods, all seemed likely to prove satisfactory. I pointed out that I did not think it would be advisable for the Board of Trade to lay down details, as if the work was carried out in an imperfect manner the nuisance would recur, and the barge owners would shelter themselves behind the Board of Trade specifications, although the Port Sanitary Committee would not accept that as a legal defence, but would be compelled to take legal proceedings for non-compliance with the terms of the Statutory Notice, inasmuch as the nuisance had recurred. I ascertained from the Principal Officer that the suggested requirements would only apply to barges carrying offensive cargoes and coming up for registration or re-registration, which latter would only become necessary owing to damage, which would alter the conditions under which the barge was originally registered. It will therefore be seen that if anything is to be done with regard to improving the sanitary conditions under which the crews of these barges have to spend their lives, that your Committee must persevere in the action which it has already taken under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and that it must be left to the owners of the barges to take whatever steps they may consider advisable in the way of structural alterations to prevent a recurrence of the nuisance. Subsequent to my interview with the Principal Officer, the Board of Trade issued instructions to their Officers, of which the following is a copy:— "Board of Trade M. 17721/1903 Continued (Marine Department). "The Surveyors, "London District, "are informed that the Board of Trade have had under consideration "the desirability of affording additional protection from effluvium in the "case of the crew spaces of barges carrying offensive cargoes. 49 "The majority of the barges referred to are registered under the "Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and the Board of Trade have decided "that the following requirements shall be made as to the construction of "the crew space whenever such a vessel is inspected by a Surveyor, either "upon registry or re-registry, or upon a complaint being made. "The bulkhead between the crew space and cargo space should be a "single water-tight bulkhead of two thicknesses of wood, tongued and "grooved, with a layer of felt and coal tar between, and with angle strips "of lead on both sides of the bulkhead all round its boundary, to prevent "loss of tightness due to working. "Any case in which it appears that the crew space is not sufficiently "protected from the danger of effluvium arising from an offensive cargo, "and that additional measures should be taken to prevent such danger, "should be reported to the Board of Trade for instruction. "The Surveyors are informed that the Port of London Sanitary "Authority will co-operate with the Board of Trade in requiring the "crew spaces of the barges referred to to be protected in the manner "described. " WALTER J. HOWELL. "5th January, 1904." In forwarding a copy of the instructions to your Worshipful Committee, it was hoped that the Port of London Sanitary Authority would be so good as to co-operate with the Officers of the Board of Trade in giving effect thereto. With regard to the instructions referred to, I have to make the following remarks:— That I am of the opinion that if the bulkheads of the barges as described are constructed in an efficient manner, the nuisance should not only be abated, but the recurrence of the same prevented. It should, however, I think, be definitely expressed that this bulkhead must be water-tight, and must extend from the level of the deck to the skin, that is, the outer planking of the vessel at the sides and bottom, so as to effectually and permanently cut off the hold from the cabin, so as not to allow any liquid or effluvium from the cargo to enter the cabin space. I also note that the requirements will only apply whenever a barge carrying or about to carry an offensive cargo is inspected for registration or re-registration. As the barges are already registered and would only come up for re-registration owing to damage which would alter the conditions under which the barge was originally registered (and I note the instructions to Surveyors puts the alternative ' or on a complaint being made,') 50 these shortcomings have been pointed out to the Board of Trade, and the Board were requested to inform this Authority whether they would cause the bulkheads as described to be placed in each barge carrying or about to carry an offensive cargo, on complaint from this Authority, and if so, this Authority would be pleased to co-operate with the Board not only by complaining, but also by directing the service of Statutory Notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requiring not only the abatement of the nuisance, but the prevention of the recurrence thereof." The Board has replied, stating that "any case in which a complaint is made " by the Port Sanitary Authority will receive the Board's careful " consideration." MERCANTILE MARINE. The result of this Inquiry is most disappointing. It is admitted that the main cause of the diminution in the numbers of British seamen is the superior attractiveness of shore employment, with its greater comforts, and an increase in the numbers may be looked for rather in the improvement of their conditions. The result of the Inquiry may be summed up as consisting in the provision of a certificated cook on every foreign-going vessel of and above 1,000 tons and also the inspection by the Board of Trade of the provisions of any vessel whose probable voyage exceeds 21 days. The conditions under which sailors have to live on board vessels is one that has been brought to the notice of your Committee on many occasions. It is true that the instructions issued by the Board of Trade to their surveyors are good as far as they go, but they do not go far enough, and many of the improvements appear to have been made in comparatively recent years. These instructions do not appear to be applicable to older vessels, and, indeed, it is the experience of your Inspectors that vessels which have been recently built, even when going on their first voyage, do not always comply with the conditions required by the Board of Trade. Each seaman is entitled to receive 72 cubic feet of space, whereas the minimum requirements were he living on shore under similar conditions would be at least 400 cubic feet. 51 It is quite the exception for a vessel to have a separate mess-room in which the crew can take their meals, so that seamen have to sleep, to take their meals, and to spend their spare time in the small space allotted to them. This space is in the majority of instances insufficiently lighted, the ventilation is bad, the ventilator, if provided, being placed in many instances immediately over a bunk, it is then generally stopped up by the occupant of the bunk, or else in other instances the ventilators are in the way on deck or are liable to be carried away at sea; they are then removed and carefully covered over with canvas, which is tied on and painted. I am treating such instances as forecastles devoid of ventilation. It is no excuse for a shipowner to say it is useless to fit ventilators as they would be carried away by the first sea coming on board. Obviously, if from this cause the forecastle cannot be efficiently ventilated, the crew must be accommodated in some other part of the ship where ventilators can be fitted without risk of being carried away. The Board of Trade requirements as to lighting state:— "Every space appropriated as crew space should be properly lighted. "To ensure that such will be the case under the ordinary conditions of a "vessel's employment, it will generally be necessary to have so much "provision for light when the ship is new and the paint clean, that if "one-third of it be closed it will be possible to read the print of an "ordinary newspaper in any part of the space." From my experience I should say that it is quite the exception to find any forecastle in which these requirements are complied with. I regard light as a most necessary means of preserving health; it is one of the most efficient purifiers; a dark forecastle is invariably a dirty forecastle, whilst a forecastle which is not properly ventilated is generally a damp forecastle, for moisture condenses on the exposed iron parts of the roof and drips into the bunks or on the floor. The conditions under which seamen have to live on board ships are such as would not be tolerated for an instant on shore, and I am bringing to the notice of the shipowners every instance where I think improvement is required and can be obtained. The remarks made with regard to seamen should also apply to the quarters inhabited by apprentices, although, as a rule, they are provided with a separate deck-house, and are a little better off. 52 A few examples of the minimum space per head in cubic feet for comparison with that allowed to seamen will be interesting:— Cubic feet, per head. Seamen's quarters 72 Common lodging-houses, sleeping rooms 300 Rooms occupied by night only 300 Registered lodging-houses, rooms occupied by day and night 400 Non-textile work-rooms, during work-time 400 Army barracks 600 Cows in cow-sheds 800 To improve the condition of seamen's accommodation on board vessels the following requirements are necessary:— 1. An increase in the available cubic space. 2. An increase in the available floor space. 3. More efficient ventilation. 4. Sufficient light, natural and artificial. 5. Thorough insulation of bare iron. 6. A separate room for meals and recreation. 7. A wash-house. The instructions issued by the Board of Trade to their Surveyors with reference to masters and crew spaces, would, if strictly carried out, materially improve the conditions under which many seamen have to live. I would, however, take this opportunity of pointing out one or two weak places. It appears that any barge employed on a river can be either registered or re-registered in the United Kingdom, without any inspection of the crew spaces on behalf of the Board of Trade, thus evading the provisions of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Further, that any vessel of whatever class or kind may, provided the owner is willing to forego any allowance from the registered tonnage on account of crew spaces, be registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, provided the Surveyor gives a certificate that he has inspected the crew spaces, notwithstanding the result of such inspection might not be satisfactory. 53 The expression of pious opinions by a Departmental Committee of the Board of Trade will not improve the conditions of life on board ships, the Board of Trade do not possess the necessary staff to supervise these conditions, and there is no doubt that all questions relating to health on ships should be dealt with by the various Sanitary Authorities acting under the Local Government Board, whilst those appertaining to safety of the ship should be left in the hands of the Board of Trade. POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. In Appendix H is given particulars of the cases in which Police Court proceedings have been taken. These will be seen to number nine, and to include offences against the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Acts, the Canal Boats Acts, and Byedaws of the Port Sanitary Authority relating to Offensive Cargoes. In only one case did the Authority fail to obtain a conviction, this being a prosecution under the Canal Boats Acts. Full particulars will be found in the special report on the working of these Acts. SANITARY WORKS AND ALTERATIONS. In Appendix F is shown a list of Sanitary Works and Alterations in connection with buildings, premises and vessels in the Docks, &c., which have been completed during the year, while in Appendix G will be found a list of those works which were in hand at the end of the year. Owing to the increase in building and drainage construction within the Docks, this class of work has for some time past formed an important part of the duties of your Inspectors. The number of inspections of this kind carried out during the year will be found in Table A under " Shore Premises." WATER BARGES. The Water Barges in the Port have been kept under regular supervision, and, as shown in Table I., the number at work at the present time is 23. One was condemned, and one new barge put into commission. 54 HOSPITAL. TABLE X. Number of Cases admitted, Cost of Maintenance, &c. Remaining in Hospital on 31st December, 1902—1. Admitted. Discharged. Died. Bubonic Plague 0 0 0 Suspected ditto 3 3 0 Small-pox 11 11 1 Scarlet Fever 5 5 0 Enteric Fever 55 43 8 Continued Fever 13 13 0 Erysipelas 1 1 0 Measles 7 7 0 Diphtheria 4 4 0 Chicken-pox 3 3 0 Tonsillitis 1 1 0 Totals 103 91 9 Remaining in Hospital on 1st January, 1904 4 Total number of days' treatment during the year 2,155 Average number o£ days' treatment for each case 20.72 The average daily cost of maintenance per head was 1s. 10.6d. As is shown in Table X., 103 cases of Infectious Disease were admitted to the Port Sanitary Hospital during the year. Amongst these cases were but 9 deaths, 8 deaths being due to Enteric Fever, this representing 14.54 per cent. of the total number of cases of this disease admitted to hospital. The remaining death was that of a Small-pox patient, this being the only fatal case out of the 11 admitted. There remained in hospital on the 31st December, 1903, 4 patients. The total number of days treatment during the year was 2,115, the average number of days treatment for each patient was 24.72, while the average daily cost per head for maintenance amounted to 1s. 10.6d., which is a reduction of the average for the preceding year. The disinfecting apparatus has been in regular use, the total number of disinfections during the year being 102. (Appendix C.) 55 During the year the Thames Conservancy called the attention of your Worshipful Committee to the discharge into the River of slop water from the Hospital at Denton. All fascal excrement from patients at the Hospital is burned. That from the household is buried in the garden, so that only laundry water and slop water was allowed to pass into the Thames. With a view to doing all that was required, your Committee sanctioned the construction of two bacteria beds. These were constructed by the City Surveyor after consulting with Mr. Dibden. The question of dealing with this waste water is not an easy one. It must either be discharged on to the land, pass through some form of filter bed, or discharge direct into the River. The land, on which the hospital is erected, being below the level of highwater mark, is, during the Winter, generally in a waterlogged condition. This has been especially the case during the past wet season. It is obvious, therefore, that this method of disposal could not be approved. The action of a filter bed consists in the breaking up of any organic matter which may be contained in the fluids, and the conversion thereof into harmless soluble nitrates. This is done through the agency of certain forms of bacteria. In dealing with infectious diseases, the use of a certain quantity of disinfectants is unavoidable, and it will be easily understood that the liquid going into the bacteria beds contains a certain proportion of disinfectant, which, if it does not destroy some of the bacteria, yet it is antagonistic to their growth and development, and, as a consequence, the beds are no longer working with the same degree of satisfaction. It will probably be necessary during the coming year to renew the coke breeze as the beds show signs of failing in their action. New Block. The number of patients treated in the Hospital has been more than in any previous year. The new Block answers its purpose admirably, and has relieved your Medical Officer there of much anxiety in isolating the different forms of infectious disease. 56 LAUNCHES. The Launches have done satisfactory work during the year, as will be seen from Table L, and the amount expended on repairs, &c., has not been above the average. "David Burnett."—This is the largest launch at present in the service of your Worshipful Committee, and was built and purchased by the Corporation in 1893 and has, therefore, been running continuously for ten years. A recent survey has shown that considerable repairs are required, also that the boiler should be lifted and carefully examined. This launch is used almost entirely for inspection in the lower part of the River, and for the removal of infectious disease to the hospital. "Clotho."—This is the second largest launch, and was built and purchased by the Corporation in 1885 ; the launch has, therefore, been in continuous work for 19 years, and has proved a cheap boat in regard to working expenses. On survey, the launch was found to require extensive renewal amounting to partial reconstruction of the hull, together with other repairs. "Denton.''—This is the smallest launch, and was built and purchased in 1896. This launch is in fair condition, but certain repairs, due principally to wear and tear, are required to put same in good condition. Detailed specifications, with estimates for all repairs to the launches, are being prepared, and will be laid before your Worshipful Committee in due course. CANAL BOATS ACTS AND REGULATIONS. In accordance with the requirements of Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I have to report upon the execution of the Canal Boats Acts, 1887 and 1884, and the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken during the year ending the 31st December, 1903, to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations in the District within the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London. (1.) The present arrangements for the inspection of canal boats are the same as those which have been in force during the past. 57 There are no Inspectors appointed solely for the work of inspecting canal boats, but the Port Sanitary Inspectors, of which there are seven, have each a district of the Port allotted to them, as follows :— Inspector Romeril 182/. per annum. Central District. West India Dock. South West India Dock. Poplar Dock. Millwall Dock. Inspector Garland 182/. per annum. Western District. London Dock. St. Katharine's Dock. Regent's Dock. Surrey Commercial Dock. Inspector Wetjen 156/. per annum. Eastern District. East India Dock. Royal Albert Dock. Royal Victoria Dock. Inspector Lambe 123/. per annum. Gravesend District. Tilbury Dock. N. Shore—from Purfleet down. S. Shore—from Erith down. RIVER. Inspector Hopkins 156/. per annum Upper District. Teddington to Limehouse. Inspector Burr 156/. per annum. Middle District. Limehouse to Erith. Inspector Rolfe 117/. per annum. Lower District. Erith to seaward limits of Port of London (including part of River Medway). These Inspectors visit Canal Boats where they are found in the course of their daily work, and the results are set out in the Table appended. 58 (2.) The appended Table shows that the number of boats inspected during the year 1903 was 1,139, the first time since the formation of this Authority that the number has exceeded 1,000. Of this number, 989, or 86.8 per cent., were found to be conforming with the Acts and Regulations. Except in regard to the cases hereinafter mentioned, no general complaint has to be made with regard to the condition of the boats and their occupants. (3.) On the remaining 150 boats were found 196 infringements of the Acts and Regulations. 126 written cautions were given; and of these, 119 are known to have been effective in remedying the defects complained of. (4) Legal proceedings were recommended by your Medical Officer in three cases, and on the advice of Mr. Solicitor summonses were issued in two, the cases being as follows:— Canal Boat "Violet," Registered Berkhampstead 322. This boat was inspected on the 13th March last, when it was found that the boat wat not lettered, marked or numbered as required by Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1877, and by the Canal Boats Regulations of the Local Government Board, 2, 7. An intimation was forwarded to the owner on the 16th March, calling his attention to the infringement of the Act and Regulations, and requiring that the lettering, marking and numbering of the boat should be carried out within seven days. Of this no notice appears to have been taken, and as the boat was again seen on the 28th April, and was still in the same state, a further intimation was sent to the owner on the 1st May, followed by a letter of inquiry on the 25th May. No reply was made to either of these communications. The boat was again inspected on the 20th June, and it was found nothing whatever had been done in the matter of complaint, and that the boat was still found to be not lettered, marked or numbered. On the 29th July, the owner of the canal boat "Violet" appeared at the Thames Police Court in answer to a summons issued by instruction of your Committee, for unlawfully using the said canal boat as a dwelling, and not having the same lettered, marked and numbered, in contravention of the Canal Boats Act. The case was supported by the Assistant Solicitor, and the defendant pleaded guilty, being fined 1/. and 23s. costs. Canal Boat " Prince Albert." This is a case of an unregistered vessel, which was being unlawfully used as a canal boat as defined by the Act and Regulations. The Canal Boat Act, 1877, Section 14, states that the expression "canal boat" means any vessel, however propelled, which is used for the conveyance of goods along a canal 59 as defined, and which is not a ship duly registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and the Acts amending the same. The definition "canal " includes any river, inland navigation, lake or water within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb or flow of the tide. The vessel is of the kind propelled by oars or towed, and is employed in the conveyance of goods between the mills and docks, is not registered under the Merchant Shipping Act, and at the time of inspection on the 16th June was in charge of one man. In answer to the questions put to him by your Inspector, it would appear that this man had been in charge of the vessel for 18 months past, and did nothing else. That the cabin was supplied with bedding and fitted with a stove, the cupboards contained food. There were cooking utensils about, and a receptacle for drinking water ; in fact the whole arrangements indicated that the cabin was in regular occupation as a dwelling, and was not used as an occasional shelter only. The vessel was again inspected on the 17th, and found in the same place and in the same occupation. It will thus be seen that according to the definition of the Canal Boats Act this barge is a canal boat, used as a dwelling and unregistered. The owners of this vessel were summoned to appear at the Thames Police Court on the 29th July. After hearing evidence, the Magistrate remarked that the Canal Boats Acts were never intended to apply to such craft as the one under consideration. It was intended to apply to canal boats for the protection of women and children, and that in this instance a man working in such a craft could very well take care of himself, and it was expected that he should take some risk. He thereupon dismissed the summons with costs against this Authority. (5.) The remaining case was that of the canal boat "Mary Ann," of Towcester, No. 140. This boat was referred to in my last Annual Report, but at the time, although legal proceedings were authorised, it was impossible to subsequently trace the boat. Since then it appears that the Master, who was also the owner of the boat, has died, and the boat was met with in this Port again on 26th and 27th October, when the cabin was found to be occupied by an adult daughter, who formerly travelled with her father, and whose occupation of the cabin was then the ground of complaint, and with her on the boat were a younger sister and two adult brothers, all apparently occupying the one cabin. 60 There was considerable doubt as to who was the legal Master or owner of the boat. A statement made to the Inspector was that the boat had been left to the elder daughter, who was working it with the assistance of her grown-up brothers, but there was no evidence of this, and the boat had not been re-registered in the name of either party. It was therefore considered that in all probability a conviction would not follow proceedings. In the meantime the boat had left the Port, and her whereabouts again became unknown. The boat appears to visit this Port about twice a year. (6) and (7.) No cases of infectious disease have been met with on any canal boats during the year, and it has not been necessary to detain any boat for cleansing or disinfection. (8.) The total number of boats registered by this Authority since 1887 is 414. Of these, 136 registrations have been cancelled. The actual number remaining on the Register to the 31st December, 1903, being 278. (9.) No new boats have been registered during the year, but eight have been re-registered—three for structural alterations, and five for other reasons.
