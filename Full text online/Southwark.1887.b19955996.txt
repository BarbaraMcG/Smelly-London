The Deaths from Zymotic Diseases were 135 above that of last year, and 48??? the average of the last ten years. But then it must be taken into consideration wo have had an epidemic of Measles, causing 75 deaths, an excess of 11 over the??? number during the last 10 years, and also of Scarlatina which caused 60. The number of deaths from Scarlatina was in 1879—80, when the deaths wero 80. At that timo wo had no Asylums to which we could send infectious cases. During the year 120 cases of Scarlet Fever, 1 of Smallpox, and 2 from Fever were sent to the Asylum by my orders, 48 of Scarlet Fovor, and 6 of??? Fever by the Relieving Officers. In the Annual Report of the Ambulance Committee it is stated that in the of October no less than 1365 patients wero admitted.

Twenty-six Pounds have been received from the coroner for the uso of the Court and Twenty-eight Pounds Sixteen Shillings have been paid to the Undertaker ???e removal of Bodies upon the Coroner's order. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have been regularly inspected. I have also ???ted the Bake-houses ; were all clean. The Water has been reported of good quality. The mean temperature for end of the nine months has been below the average, in the case of October, there has been no corresponding month as cold during the ???ty years, and only three colder for April. The rainfall has been much below the average. I remain, Yours obediently, THOS. H. WATERWORTH, M.D. 16 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. TABLE No. 8. 1887-8.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit my Eighteenth Annual Report your consideration. A part of the eastern side of the carriageway of Old Kent ???ad, between milestone and Thomas Street has been taken up, ???ssed and relaid. About one third new 4 by 7 Guernsey Granite ???bes were supplied in the area repaved to replace the cubes ???t were unfit to be relaid. The new cubes were laid opposite ???mondsey New Road, where there is the largest amount of traffic. A similar plan should be adopted with reference to both sides the carriageway, Old Kent Road, from Boundary, Great Dover ???eet, to Surrey Square. The remaining portion of the road from ???rrey Square to Boundary, next to Camberwell Parish, will, with ???e repairs by the Vestry's workmen, last for some years to come ???thout requiring to be relaid. 26 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. The new Street through the Mint from Blackman Stree Great Dover Street has at last been opened by the Metropol??? Board of Works. The plans, &c., of the same were approved the Vestry, and adopted by the Metropolitan Board in 1875. The ??? delay in carrying out this improvement was partly due to the S??? Eastern Railway Co's scheme for proposed new lines and wideni??? the Metropolitan Board and the Railway Company having requ??? in nearly every case the same property. The proposed new was intended to follow nearly the line of the new Street; hap??? however, the Railway Company have abandoned their sch??? for the time, otherwise their new line would have very consider??? spoilt the improvement. The City and Southwark Subway Company's Works are??? progress; the brickwork to the Station, Blackman Street, 200 in length being partly completed; and one of the iron tun??? having progressed as far as Newington Causeway, the other tunne??? far as Trinity Street, in both cases from Old Swan Pier, Lon??? Bridge. A subsidence has occurred in the Carriageway and Foot??? Blackman Street, over the Station, and also a collapse of Footway Carriageway, Newington Causeway, in both instances, in my opin??? caused by the Subway Company's Works. A Shaft 25 feet diameter has been sunk in Marshalsea R??? which will form an entrance to the Station, Blackman Street, and Iron Tunnels are an average depth of 65 feet below the surface??? the Roads, and 10 feet 2 inches diameter in the clear each. I beg respectfully again to urge on the Vestry the adoption of average meter system as to gas lighting, which I feel confident wo??? result in a large saving to the ratepayers.

The whole of the Brick and Pipe Sewers have been flushed a. cleansed. The necessity for the construction of Flushing Chambers at the ■ imits of the Pipe Sewers that cannotv be flushed by means of I :k sewers still continues; the Flushing Chamber constructed at the 'g imit of Pipe Sewer Elliott's Row works well, with great advantage •1 ,ewer in that street, as well as in St. George's Road. I beg again to draw the attention of the Vestry to the benefit that I aid arise to this Parish by the main sewers under the control of the [htropolitan Board being more thoroughly flushed by utilizing the | ter from the River Thames; this could be done by connecting the nmits of main brick sewers on Southern side of Thames by means of rich pipes with the same when an unlimited supply of water would rays be available at high water. The undermentioned Works have also been executed, viz:— wers opened, cleansed and repaired 59 :w Sewer constructed and lengthened i )use Drains connected into Sewer 37 iw Gullies Constructed 3 ushing Chamber constructed i ! ouse Drains cleared by Flushers 45 I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, A.
