To THE WORSHIPFUL, THE PORT OF LONDON HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Circular 60/46 of the Ministry of Health dated 20th March, 1946, directs as follows "I am directed by the Minister of Health to say that he has had under consideration the scope of the Annual Reports to be made by Medical Officers of Health of Port Health and Riparian Authorities for the year 1945. The Minister desires that the Report for that year should be prepared on the lines of memo.204/S.A., so far as the information is available, and the advice as to omissions given in Circular 1937 of 11th January, 1940, should be regarded as no longer applicable. It is appreciated, however, that the available records may not be sufficient to give full particulars under all heads for 1945; where this is the case, the Authority should take such steps to re-institute the normal records for 1946 and future years". One hundred and fifty-two cases of communicable diseases (including malaria) were reported as having occurred on vessels during the voyage of which 74 were landed in the Port. Sixty-eight cases, of which particulars are given in Appendix II (b), were admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospitals. Although Denton Hospital was de-requisitioned by the Admiralty in October the arrangements for the reception of communicable diseases by Hospitals in the vicinity of the River, was continued throughout the year. The Disinfector, however, was still at the disposal of the Authority and continued to be used for the disinfection of cases arriving at Gravesend, their clothing, bedding and effects No cases of human plague occurred during the year on a vessel bound for London. Of the 1,030 rats examined bacteriologically, 791 were from vessels and 239 from shore premises. No rat was reported be infected with Plague. Two hundred and fifteen vessels were fumigated for rodent destruction and the issue of International Certificates, under the supervision of your Inspectors. Five were fumigated sulphur dioxide resulting in the destruction of 265 rats and 2l0 by hydrogen cyanide accounting for 6,896 rats and 991 mice. A total of 10,752 rats were destroyed during the coup of the year, 7,522 in ships and 3,210 on shore premises in the Port. In addition 1,973 mice were destroyed, 874 in ships and 1,099 on shore premises. - 5 - The Rodent Control scheme carried out by this Authority in the docks and premises of the Port of London Authority, on behalf of that Authority, and in the premises of the tenants of the Authority on behalf of the occupiers, continued to work satisfactorily throughout the year. The work carried out under the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, still in operation, is reported on page 9. Water Barges for the supply of drinking water to vessels, though few in number, were still required to be inspected as to their fitness for the carriage of drinking water and their registration was made conditional on the Report of your officers. The policy of salving damaged foodstuffs and the reconditioning where possible to render them fit either for human or for animal consumption or for industrial purposes, remained an urgent necessity and was continued throughout the year. Details of the uses to which the foodstuffs have been put are given on page 10. An outstanding example of the valuable co-operation between the Officers of the Ministry of Food, the Port of London Authority, certain of the Riparian Authorities and your Officers in maintaining a highly efficient service of food salvage, is clearly illustrated by the joint action taken in the disposal of a large consignment of dates and which is reported in some detail on page 10. The total amount of foodstuffs seized and condemned for human consumption and either reconditioned or disposed of for animal consumption or for industrial purposes under guarantee or destroyed was 720 tons as compared with 1,238 tons during the previous year. Your Medical Officer would like to take this opportunity of thaniking the Officers of His Majesty's Customs, Port of London Authority, the Pilots and the members of the staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants for their collaboration and assistance in every aspect of the work of the Port Health Authority throughout the year. A number of your outdoor staff of Inspectors and launch crews returned from the fighting services during the later part of the year and have taken up their duties in the Docks and on the River. I have pleasure in reporting that all members of your staff have carried out their duties both willingly and efficiently. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, M. T. MORGAN. - 6 - TABLE C. CASES OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES FROM VESSELS.

There also arose the question of acquiring another barge to take the place of the "ELLA VICARS" which was considered as beyond repair owing to war damage. A suitable craft - a wooden sailing barge, the "UPLEES" was offered for sale by Messrs. Thomas P. Wood of Gravesend and its ultimate purchase was accelerated by the fact that on the 6th September the "ELLA VICARS" was again so severely damaged by a steamship while lying at the moorings that she had to be beached and became a total wreck. The new mooring barge the "UPLEES" was towed up from Gravesend by your m.l. "ALFRED ROBERTSON" on the 3rd November and moored at the new site off the South Metropolitan Gas Co., at East Greenwich. PARROTS (PROHIBITION OF IMPORT) REGULATIONS, 1950. Twenty-one parrots etc. came under the notice of your Officers during the year. Thirteen Notices were issued in respect of 19 parrots etc.- Number exported in respect of Notices served 8 Number destroyed (Notice served to export) 9 Number admitted under Ministry of Health permit 2 Bodies of birds sent for investigation to the Ministry of Health Nil Number transhipped on through Bills Nil 19 - 10 - DANGEROUS DRUGS. During the year 13 certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued by your Medical Officer under the Dangerous Drugs (No.3) Regulations, 1923, amending the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936. PART X - CANAL BOATS. On the 11th January, 1946, the Port Medical Officer made a report on the steps taken to carry into effect the provisions of Part X of the Public Health Act, 1936, relating to Canal Boats within the district of the Port of London Health Authority, during the year ended 31st December, 1945. During the year 33 inspections of Canal Boats were made of which 31 were found to conform to the Acts and Regulations. Written cautions were given in respect of the two vessels found not to conform. No new boats were registered during the year under review, the actual number of Canal Boats on the Register on the 31st December, 1945, being 216. FOOD INSPECTION. The inspection of foodstuffs under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937, and the Public Health (Preservatives, etc. in Food) Regulations, 1925-1927, resulted in the seizure and destruction of 721 tons of foodstuffs, a decreasf of some 517 tons as compared with last year. The following is a summary showing the method of disposal of the foodstuffs seized METHOD OF DISPOSAL. WEIGHT APPROXIMATE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL. TONS CWTS. QRS, LBS.

In January a consignment of some 6,000 tons of dates arrived in London and was distributed, for storage, in the Surrey Commercial Dock (15,547 cases) and at wharves in the City of London and the Boroughs of Southwark, Bermondsey, Stepney and Poplar. - 11 - The Ministry of Food, Dried Fruits Section, explained that the dates were an old crop (some eighteen months old) and although their sale for retail was out of the question they were of the opinion that the dates were not totally unfit for human consumption. Samples of the dates were drawn and examined and following a conference between the Ministry of Food and representatives of the local authorities concerned it was agreed that the dates, aftor sorting, could be disposed of as follows, without any danger to the public health:- (a) For pickle and sauce manufacture or for other facturing purposes involving boiling. (b) For the bakery and confectionery trade provided that the Health Authorities of the receiving areas could be notified prior to the dispatch of the goods and permission obtained from them to enter the area. This arrangement, together with the obtaining of guarantees from each individual purchaser was obviously going to entail a considerable amount of clerical work and in order to avoid duplication it was decided, with the consent of the local authorities concerned, that this work should be undertaken by your Authority. Details of a scheme for controlling the distribution of the dates was worked out in conjunction with the Ministry of Food, who supplied lists of the names and addresses of intending purchasers. The number of these individual purchasers was no less than 1,636 whose premises were situated in 6S8 different local authorities areas. Seventy-six of these local authorities declired to receive the dates into their areas, the main objection being chat they did not have sufficient staff to carry out the necessary supervision. Nevertheless some 4,200 tons of dates were disposed. of in this manner and it is gratifying to note that not one single complaint has reached either this office or the Ministry of Food from any source, of any ill effects resulting from the use of these dates for manufacturing purposes. The full extent of the amount of clerical work involved is evident from the following summary of the numbers of individual postal packets sent out - To Medical Officers of Health 1,444 To Merchants 1,283 To Ministry of Food 67 Total - 2,794 This resulted in an expenditure of £29.10s.7½d. in postage, which amount will be reimbursed the Authority by the Ministry of Food. - 12 - FOOD INSPECTION ctd. There is little doubt that a review of the whole policy of the inspection of foodstuffs and the conservation of as much food as possible that is fit for human or animal consumption, if necessary after reconditioning or processing in some form or another, is long overdue as also is a change in the Regulations (Imported Pood Regulations and the Preservatives in Pood Regulations) which cover not only the type of foodstuffs but also the system of inspection and the rejection of foods which do not conform with the requirements of the Regulations. Before the war the policy of the Government can be stated briefly as a policy of admitting from abroad only the fines quality of food, free from all taint or disease, and this no doubt was a sound policy since food was plentiful, reasonably cheap and the Government on behalf of the consumer could afford to pick and choose. Present day conditions are very different and with a world shortage it is vitally important to conserve every particle of food that is fit for human or animal consumption. Furthermore and in consequence, we can no longer afford to require only the highest quality but must take whatever is available. Much of the foodstuff coming into this country at the present moment is incapable of inspection. This applies particularly to meat since it is impossible to identify what part of the carcase it comes from; indeed, many hundreds of tons of meat are being imported in the form of 'scrap' meat which is categorically prohibited by the present Regulations. The Regulations do not apply in principle to foodstuffs in charge of the Crown but the fact remains that the object of the Regulations - the control of the healthiness of foodstuffs, i.e. their fitness for human or animal consumption, is not being observed. True there is a control to the extent that all animals are inspected ante and post mortem in the country of origin and certificated in a manner approved by the United Kingdom Government, but the final right of inspection, and if necessary of rejection in the port of arrival in the United Kingdom, which the Government has always maintained, cannot be observed for the reasons stated above. A great deal of effort has been expended, not only by the Port Health Staff but also by the agents of the Ministry of Food between whom there has been, and is, a close and constant collator! tion towards the conservation of foodstuffs and the avoidance of waste. This has resulted in the saving of many hundreds of tons good food. It is, of course, a policy which involves a considerable lowering of pre-War standards but it is, nevertheless, a souni policy and there is little doubt that the former standards were in fact extremely wasteful and resulted in an inexcusable loss of good nutriment. One feature of the present regime which mitigates agains efficiency is a lack of recognised standards and concerted action between the various ports of entry. A Port Medical Officer in one port may reject foodstuffs which would not be rejected in another port. Furthermore, Medical Officers of Health may refuse to accep foodstuffs into their areas which require reconditioning under their supervision. What is needed is a conference convened by the Ministry of Food at which the parties concerned can discuss the numerous problems that arise in the control of imported foodstuffs and agree upon a policy for all to follow in the future. - 13 - APPENDIX 1.
