AC 4372 WOO 57 metropolitan BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1957 BY T. STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OP WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1957 by T. Standring, M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H., M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,P.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health. PREFACE To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. MR. MAYOR, IADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in submitting the Fifty-Seventh Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Woolwich, the Report being on the lines requested by the Minister of Health. The Registrar General's estimate of the mid-year population for the Borough is 146,200, being a decrease of 1,300 on the previous year and a decrease of 5,600 on the comparable figure for 1952. This steady drop in the population during the last five years is partly due to less overcrowding and partly, especially in the last two years, to a reduction in the number of military personnel stationed in the Borough. The general health of the Borough remains good. There were no maternal deaths in 1957. There was an increase of 16 in the number of infant deaths. This increase is almost wholly accounted for by premature births and conditions associated therewith. Premature birth is the biggest single cause of infantile death, and when this cause has been fully resolved a further substantial reduction in the Infantile Mortality Rate can be expected. Concerning illness from infectious diseases, the incidence of poliomyelitis was on a small scale, and no deaths have been recorded in the Borough during the last two years.An increasing number of parents are now taking advantage of the increased supply of vaccine, and have agreed to their children being inoculated. Dysentery in young children in its mild sonne form continues to have a transient but upsetting effect on family life. Asian flu was prevalent in the area during the Autumn months. It spread from school to school and in a short time resulted in many temporary absences. Woolwich also had its share of measles cases which was also prevalent in London. Deaths from malignant diseases totalled 313, of which 80 deaths were from cancer of the lung and bronchus. It is now generally accepted by the medical profession that there is a strong association between the increased death rate from cancer of the lung and bronchus, and smoking and pollution of the air. Most of the time of the District Public Health Inspectors has again been concerned with the inspection of dwellings, and the remedying of defects. With the advent of the Rent Act, 1957, the - 2 - Health Department received more than 300 applications from tenants for the issue of Certificates of Disrepair, which, if granted, have the effect of preventing an immediate increase of rent by the landlord. Despite the intricate procedure to be observed, and the large number of applications received in a very short period, all applications for Certificates were dealt with promptly. Immediately on the introduction of the Rent Act the Council determined to give all possible help and information to the parties concerned, and arranged for special sessions to be held at the Information Bureau at the Town Hall for this purpose. The effects of the Council's slum clearance policy are now very noticeable, more particularly in the St. Mary's Area of Woolwich, which has been transformed following the demolition of many old buildings and the erection and occupation of nearly 300 new dwellings by the end of the year. Since redevelopment commenced in 1952, 1,330 persons have been taken from slum properties in this area. The last completed bouse on the Coldharbour Estate was occupied during the year, an event which was celebrated by the visit of Her Majesty the Queen Mother during the month of May. In addition the Council also declared the first part of its Ann Street Clearance Scheme, comprising 100 unfit properties, and a further 60 properties on adjoining land which will also be acquired in order to obtain a cleared site of convenient shape and size. The London County Council are also making progress in the development of the large new Abbey Estate on the Abbey Wood Marshes. Daring the year much time has been devoted by the Council and its Officers to the preliminary work connected with the declaration of the first Smoke Control Areas in the Borough. Immediately on the passing of the Clean Air Act, the Council resolved to implement fully its provisions, particularly those relating to smoke control areas and industrial premises. In November the Borough's first smoke control areas were declared, the Orders relating to areas at Abbey Wood, Middle Park and a portion of the St. Mary's Redevelopment Area. It is the Council's aim to make the whole of the Borough of Woolwich smokeless at the earliest opportunity, and whilst realising the effort and expense involved, the Council are determined to see that this is achieved, if possible within the next 12 to 15 years. There can be no doubt as to the ultimate beneficial results of this work to a Borough such as Woolwich. The co-operation of the householder is of vital importance, and a great deal of time has been devoted to visiting and discussions with residents in the proposed smoke control areas. The problems involved include conversion of domestic appliances and the correct use of smokeless fuels. There are 715 dwellinghouses in the Abbey Wood Smoke Control Area requiring conversion, and 1,614 in the Middle Park Area. - 3 - Over 1,000 visits were made during the year to these houses, and it is considered that the time was well spent. A feature of the Health Education activities of the Council recently has been the emphasis placed on the benefits of clean air. Besides arranging and presenting 118 programmes on health subjects to local organisations in their own meeting places, including the showing of films and the giving of talks, the Council's health education unit was also responsible for arranging an exhibit at the Woolwich Trade Pair, at which a short film made by members of the staff dealing with the declaration by the Council of its smoke control areas aroused interesto A mobile hut was erected in the Abbey Wood Smoke Control Area to act as an enquiry and demonstration centre, at which residents in the future Smoke Control Area can seek advice on problems regarding the conversion of domestic appliances and the burning of smokeless fuel. The hut is manned by the Council's technical Officers and three approved appliances burning smokeless fuels are under fire. It is the intention to move the hut to other parts of the Borough on the declaration of future Smoke Control Areas. The improvement of the conditions at the many local food premises, and of the practices of the food handlers, continued during the year. The Council is fortunate in being able to retain an adequate number of Food InspectorsÂ® Suggestions made by the Department for improving the conditions at these food premises were acted upon. Nevertheless, although the standard in the Borough is generally satisfactory, and in some notable cases exceptionally good, there are a number of food shops where the standard of food hygiene needs still further improvement. During the year the Council continued to take an active interest in the welfare of the elderly, and extended this work in two directions. Firstly, the year was important for the re-establishment of the Mobile Meals Service to cater for those housebound people who are in need of a hot meal. This service is being operated jointly by the Women's Voluntary Service and the Council of Social Service, receiving financial assistance from the Borough Council. Secondly, the Council established a laundry scheme to assist aged persons for whom no other arrangements for the laundering of soiled linen were possible. The regular home visitation scheme continued and there is evidence that the large number of visits made by the Council's woman Inspector to the homes of the elderly achieved worthwhile results and were much appreciated. With regard to the possibility of the re-transfer of the personal health services from the County Council to the Metropolitan Borough Councils, it will be recalled that agreement was reached some two - 4 - years ago between the County Council and the Borough Councils on the restoration of these services, hut subject to ministerial approval. This approval was not forthcoming during the year. In the meantime, the Government had decided to establish a Royal Commission to enquire into the status, functions and areas of local authorities in the Greater London Area, and in these circumstances any action on the transfer of these services has had to be postponed until after the Royal Commission's report. During 1957, Mr. T.H. Prescott who had been Chief Administrative Assistant with the Health Department since 1947 retired after having had 44 years' service with the Council, having joined the Health Department in 1915. Mr. Prescott left with the good wishes of everyone. He was succeeded by Mr. A. Healey, who has been Senior Clerk for the past eight years. In conclusion, I welcome this opportunity of acknowledging the help and co-operation I have received from the Members of the Council and from other Chief Officers. I should also like to thank the staff of my Department for their continued good work and valuable support during the year, I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. STANDRING.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS During 1957, it was found necessary in two cases to institute legal proceedings in order to obtain compliance with notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Both cases were adjourned sine die as the necessary work was put in hand. WATER SUPPLY Domestic water is supplied to the Borough entirely by the Metropolitan Water Board, and samples of the water are regularly subjected to chemical and bacteriological examination by the Board at its laboratories. The condition of the water supply throughout the year was satisfactory both in quality and quantity. No complaints were received in connection with the Borough's water supply. In addition to the water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, local industry obtains additional supplies from wells in the Borough. Of the eleven wells known to exist, seven are still in use. The water from these wells is used for fire-fighting as well - 16 - as industrial purposes. The Council's baths at Woolwich and Plumstead each draw water from a well. Samples of water from the wells in use are submitted for bacteriological examination and the results show the water to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE A total of 256 drainage defects were found during the year, and the necessary work of repair or reconstruction was supervised by the Public Health Inspectors. Officers of the Department supervised 39 smoke tests on suspected defective private and combined drains. Nineteen of these tests produced positive results, the remainder were proved to be sound. A further four tests which also produced positive results were in respect of disused drains which were exposed and permanently sealed off. Of the 28 combined drains inspected during the year, four were found to be defective. In the case of the defective combined drains, notices were served under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, on the owners concerned and the work of repair and reconstruction was carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department,, The cost of the work necessary was shared between the responsible owners. REGISTRATION OF HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS PREMISES All persons carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber in the Borough must be registered and also have their premises registered. The Council have made Byelaws to secure the cleanliness of these shops and of the instruments and equipment used therein,, Applications for registration were received during the year in respect of 43 Ladies' hairdressers premises, 44 Gentlemen's and 13 combined Ladies' and Gentlemen's premises. Regular inspections are made by the Public Health Inspectors. PROVISION OF DUSTBINS During the year, 33 notices were served on the owners of premises in the Borough under the provisions of Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, requesting the supply of a dustbin. No appeals were made against the notices served by the Council. - 17 - PET SHOPS There are ten pet shops in the Borough, and these are licensed annually by the Council and are visited periodically by the Public Health Inspectors, to ensure that the requirements of the Pet Animals Act, 1951, and the conditions subject to which licences are issued are being complied with. Sixty-eight inspections of pet shops were made during the year. SHOPS ACT, 1950 The provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to suitability of ventilation, washing facilities and sanitary accommodation, and the maintenance of suitable temperature in shops is the responsibility of the Borough Council. Altogether 738 visits of inspection were made by the Public Health Inspectors for this purpose during the year. REGISTRATION OF PREMISES SELLING PART II POISONS Names are entered in the Council's list of persons entitled to sell Part II poisons (other than registered Pharmacists) in respect of 155 premises in the Borough. LICENSING OF COMMON LODGING HOUSES The one remaining licensed common lodging house in the Borough, at 102, Woolwich High Street, was relicensed for the ensuing year. The premises have accommodation for 22 men., RODENT CONTROL There were 956 complaints of rats and 363 of mice received during 1957, and in addition to the investigation of these complaints the systematic inspection under the "block control" system was continued. A total of 17,110 premises were inspected and of these 13,795 were under the "block control" system. The number of properties found to be infested by rats or mice was 1,494. which included 124 business or industrial premises. Where the cause of the infestation appears to be due to defective drains or other defects in the building, the owner is requested to effect the necessary repairs, In this connection the Department carried out 39 smoke tests on suspected defective drains at rat infested premises, and these tests produced evidence of 18 defective drains. - 18 - A total of 40 "block control" schemes was carried, out during the year, As in previous years the Council continued its practice of arranging free treatment in respect of infestations in private dwellings, A charge is made for treatment carried out by the Council at business and industrial premises. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer's Department two sewer treatments were undertaken during 1957. At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food an extended period of baiting and recording of poison "takes" was adopted, prebaiting being carried out on the first day, again on the fourth day and poison bait laid on the eighth day. (The previous method had involved prebaiting on the first and second days and poison baiting on the third day). The bait used was sausage rusk and zinc phosphide with paranitophenol in the poison,, Doubling up on complete "takes" was carried out and when recording poison "takes" each gang carried poison bait to put down where there had been complete "takes" of poison. The number of prebait "takes" recorded in the April treatment showed a ten per cent. increase over the last treatment under the old method of baiting described above. It was anticipated that there would be a marked decrease in "takes" in the October treatment;, but the result showed only a three per cent reduction in prebait and poison "takes" Thus it would appear that no matter what method is adopted the number of rats remaining will build up during the six months interval. During both treatments the weather was fine with no heavy rainfall to interfere with the free movement of rats in the sewers, MOSQPITOS AND OTHER PESTS During 19579 a number of complaints were received from various parts of the Borough of infestations of cockroaches, moths, crickets, and silver fish. Advice was given in each case, and, where necessary, treatment carried out. Five infestations of cockroaches, one infestation of mosquitos seven infestations of clover-mites and one infestation of ants were dealt with by the Department,and three wasps nests were destroyed during the year. Small charges were made for this work. Forty-two houses and their contents were treated for infestations of woodworm, the majority of these houses being in the ownership of the Council, Charges totalling Â£163.12.3d. were made upon the responsible persons for the treatment referred to above, - 19 - FACTORIES ACT, 1937 TABLE No, 10.

Local industry also employs 76 outworkers who reside outside the Borough. Periodical inspections of the outworkers' homes are made by the Council's Public Health Inspectors, Altogether 272 such visits were made in 1957 to ensure that the home working conditions were satisfactory, CLEAN AIR (A) Smoke Control Areas - The part of the Clean Air Act, 1956, relating to the setting up of Smoke Control Areas was brought into force on the 30th December, 1956, and immediately the Council decided to make full use of these new provisions, Three Smoke Control Areas were proposed9 details of which are as followss- (i) Abbey Wood. This area comprises a total of 157 acres, including 74 acres of open land. It is bounded on the south by Bostall Hill and Old Park Road, on the west by Basildon Road, on the north by McLeod Road, and on the east by Knee Hill, and comprises 1,154 dwellings, including 432 Council dwellings, together with 13 commercial premises and three others. It was originally proposed that this Staoke Control Order should become operative in September, 1958, but having regard to possible difficulties in connection, with the prefabricated bungalows in the Area, the operative date of the Order was deferred until 1st October, 1959, -21 - by which time these dwellings should be cleared. The conversion of appliances in domestic premises to burn smokeless fuel will be required at some 715 dwellings in this Area, involving the total replacement of some 970 appliances. The total expenditure is estimated at about Â£13,000, of which the Council's contribution will be three-tenths, and the Government's contribution four-tenths. (ii) St. Mary'so This Smoke Control Area comprises a total of 26 acres, in two parts of 21 acres and 5 acres. The first portion is bounded to the north by Woolwich Church Street and Chapel Hill, to the south by the railway line, and to the east by St. Mary's Churchyardo All properties in this portion are new Council dwellings, with approved appliances.Since 1955 a clause in the tenancy agreement for each house has required the use of smokeless fuel only in these properties. The smaller area comprises Council properties, on land on both sides of Rectory Place, and the flats formerly in the ownership of the Church Commissioners, flanking on Kingsman Street, in which there are 56 dwellings requiring some adaptation. The operative date of this Order will be October, 1958. It is proposed that further Orders will be made in this area as redevelopment proceeds. The estimated' cost of adaptations in this Area is about Â£350. (iii) Middle Park, This Smoke Control Area embraces a total of 263 acres, including 57 acres of open land, and comprises the Council's Middle Park Housing Estate of 1,518 houses, with an additional 96 private dwellings, 15 commereial premises and three others. The new property being erected by the Council at the junction of Court Road and Middle Park Avenue is also included. The operative date is the 1st October, 1959. The total cost is estimated at about Â£82,000. Following detailed inspections of all premises in the above mentioned Areas, estimates of numbers and costs of appliance replacements and other work required at premises in the Areas were prepared, and the Council's Smoke Control Orders submitted to the Minister at the end of the year for confirmation, The Council have been represented at several meetings with neighbouring authorities to discuss smoke control proposals and problems. At these meetings matters of mutual interest and the possibility of joint action were discussed. -22- (B) Publicity, The Minister of Housing and Local Government, in his explanatory memorandum on Smoke Control Areas, asks that the maximum publicity be given to the Council's action in setting up such areas so as to obtain the willing co-operation of the publico Accordingly, every owner and occupier in the Smoke Control Areas was informed by letter of the Council's intention, and a booklet containing a guide to the provisions of the Act and other useful explanatory material was prepared and published by the Council, and distributed to every householder and owner of property in each Area. To facilitate the successful operation of the Smoke Control Areas, the co-operation of fuel producers and merchants, appliance manufacturers, builders' merchants, ironmongers and others, in addition to that of the householders, is regarded as essential. A meeting was held with fuel traders, trade associations and representatives of the Ministry of Power. These consultations proved extremely useful in reviewing the difficulties likely to arise, particularly in the supply of some of the authorised fuels. A meeting with builders, builders' merchants, ironmongers and appliance manufacturers also served a useful purpose, giving an opportunity for the exchange of views on the installation of "approved appliances". In collaboration with the Coal Utilisation Council, a lecture was arranged at the Woolwich Polytechnic on the "Correct Methods of Fixing Solid Fuel Appliances", at which many local builders attended. Since Abbey Wood is the first Area which has a large number of conversions to be carried out in respect of private property, a public meeting was arranged in the Area to publicise the Council's policy and settle any points raised by residents. Representatives of the Council and a specialist in fuels were present on the platform, and following a statement on the Council's policy by the Chairman of the Health Committee, questions were answered. There was a capacity audience of over 350. Coinciding with the public meeting, a prefabricated demonstration hut was opened on land adjacent to the Abbey Wood Smoke Control Area. In the hut are displayed samples of all the "authorised" fuels, together with various approved appliances, some of which are under fire, and accessories, The purpose of the hut is to demonstrate to the inhabitants of the Smoke Control Area types of fires and fuels available and their proper method of operation. The demonstration hut is open for periods during each week and attendances have been good. Numerous questions have been asked of the Public Health -23 - Inspectors on duty. It is intended that this hut shall be moved in future years to other Smoke Control Areas as they are made by the Council. The Health Department took part in the Woolwich Trade Fair organised by the Chamber of Commerce and held in the Town Hall at the end of September for one week. A stand was built which displayed all the "authorised" fuels, together with selection of approved appliances, and a large map or the Borough showing the location of the proposed Smoke Control Areas. A three minute sound film made by the Council's staff was shown continuously by means of rear projection. Whilst the Pair was essentially a commercial enterprise, a large number of people expressed interest in the Smoke Control activities of the Council, and numerous questions were asked. The Health Department's waiting room was also used to display a more comprehensive selection of approved appliances, fuels and accessories. In the construction of the Department's stand at the Trade Fair and the demonstration hut at present at Abbey Wood, considerable assistance was given by the Coal Utilisation Council and other interested organisations, (c) Smoke Nuisances. It is anticipated that the remaining provisions of the Clean Air Act, I956, will come into force during 1958. These provisions will deal with the emission of "dark smoke" and the emission of smoke, grit and dust from industrial chimneys. Preparations are being made to implement this legislation, including visits to local factories and discussions with the managements, The smoke nuisance provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, continued to be administered, and 22 complaints of smoke nuisance were received during the year. They were immediately investigated by the Council's Smoke Inspector, and a number of visits were made to factories and advice given on smoke prevention methods. In addition, throughout the year routine observations were carried out on factory chimneys in the Borough. MEASUREMENT AND RECORDING OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Monthly measurements of deposits of sulphur trioxide and solid matter are taken at five measuring stations situated within the Borough which are maintained by the Council. In addition, the Council have set up three smoke measuring stations where daily readings are obtained,, It will be seen from the following table that, in general, the pollution by sulphur trioxide is less in the summer months than in the winter, thus emphasising the part played by domestic chimneys in pollution of the atmosphere. - 24 - TABLE No. 11.

Nearly 3,000 such visits were made by the Council's woman Inspector during 1957. whereas in some parts of the Borougn a lone person can often rely on the help of neighbours and other friends living nearby, yet in other areas he or she may be less fortunate and have no friends in close contact,and in such cases, the home visitation service has a vital part to play. Where hospital admission is needed the Health Department can often assist in the arrangements. During the year a number of persons were found to be living in poor conditions and unable to look after themselves, and were not receiving adequate attention from others. All these persons were persuaded either to enter a suitable Home, or failing this to have further domestic assistance, or nursing care. It was not necessary to use the Council's powers of compulsory removal during the year, Mobile Meals Service. In mid-1957 it was learnt that the Women's Voluntary Service wass prepared to put at the disposal of the Borough a new 10 cwt. van fully equipped with hot-lock containers, together with the supply of petrol by the W.V.S., and in view of this offer the Old People's Welfare Committee recommended the Council that a mobile meals service should operate in the Borough on four days a week. The Council were satisfied on the need and agreed to support, The service commenced on the 11th September with an official Opening Ceremony, the Mayor receiving the van from the W.V.S, Regional Administrator. Along with the Mayoress, he then accompanied the delivery of the first meal,, Meals are supplied by the Plumstead caterer who at the present time supplies meals to the Eltham Lunch Club,The scheme is administered jointly by the W.V.S and the Woolwich Council of Social Service. Extreme care is taken to ensure that only those persons needing the service are entered on the list of recipients. On the receipt of each application, a personal visit is made to assess the degree of priority,, When the service commenced, 24 meals a day were being served on the Tuesday and Thursday route, which is the longer and takes in Eltham and part of upper Plumstead and Woolwich, and 28 meals a dav on the Wednesday - 26 - and Friday route (Plumstead and Abbey Wood area). Within a month of the commencement of the service over 100 applications had been received. There were 16 regular helpers and 11 drivers giving their services voluntarily. The financing of the Mobile Meals Scheme is similar to the financial arrangements for the Lunch Clubs, the old person paying l0d. per meal, the County Council contributing a similar amount per meal, and the Borough Council making a financial contribution to cover the remaining expenses, apart from the cost of petrol. The Old People's Welfare Committee report that the recipients consider that the meals are extremely good and are received hot. Delivery of the meals was speeded up once the drivers became more familiar with the routes. However, it is not practical to deliver more than about 36 meals a day because of the time factor. Lunch Clubs The Plumstead and Eltham Lunch Clubs operated fully during 1957 on five days per week. The number of persons having meals varied little from the previous year. Meals for the Plumstead Lunch Club are transported daily from the Plumstead Baths, and those for the Eltham Lunch Club are delivered to the Progress Hall from a Plumstead caterer. A contribution of over Â£1,000 was made by the Borough Council to this service during the year. Holidays. The Holiday Scheme in the Borough is operated by the Woolwich Council of Social Service. Applications were received from 140 elderly persons living in the Borough to have a holiday in 1957, and although there were 100 places available, due to unavoidable cancellations, no one who had not had a holiday in the last two years was refused. Owing to the increased grant made available for this work in the year it was possible for 16 more persons to have a holida; than in 1956. Forty-five persons went to Westgate for a week's holiday in May and 40 in September, all travelling by coach. In addition, 50 infirm persons were helped with a holiday at a special holiday hone. Altogether there were 17 cancellations, including 8 through illness. Personal interviews were necessary in respect of all the applicants. About 90 per cent, of those having a holiday were in receipt of National Assistance. The Old People's Welfare Committee report that the arrangements worked very satisfactorily, and that more than 50 letters of appreciation were received during the year. - 27 - Laundering for Aged and Incontinent The washing of soiled linen may be carried out under the Council's powers contained in Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, which relates to the cleansing, disinfection or destruction of filthy, unwholesome or verminous articles. In relation thereto laundering facilities have been provided for a small number of elderly patients where other arrangements were not reasonably possible. Altogether, 1,123 articles were laundered during the year by the Council's staff at the Disinfecting Station, at which there are facilities for laundry work to be carried out on a small scale. The number of articles laundered were as follows:- Night attire 128? sheets 553; drawsheets 386; blankets 16? pillowcases 44; towels 79; miscellaneous 117. ELITHAM CREMATORIUM The new Crematorium situated on land adjoining Eltham Cemetery is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich and North West Kent Joint Crematorium Committee, comprising the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dartford and Erith, and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup, and Crayford. Cremations from other areas are also accepted. Originally two cremators were installed, but owing to the increased use being made of the Crematorium, arrangements were made during the year for a third cremator to be installed. Prom the 15th August, 1956, when the Crematorium was opened, to the 7th December, 1957, a total of 2,317 cremations have taken place, the receptions from each district being as followss:- Woolwich 643? Greenwich 142? Bexley 422; Dartford 142; Chislehurst and Sidcup 247? Erith 140; Crayford 74; and other"areas 501. The number of cremations during 1957 was 1,931. BURIALS AND CREMATIONS Arrangements were made by the Health Department during the year for the burial of five persons and the cremation of another,who had died or been found dead in the Borough, in cases where it appeared that no other suitable funeral arrangements were being made. Pour of the six persons were elderly and in respect of whom a Government death grant was not available. The fifth was an unknown child found in a public place. The person cremated had made a specific request to this effect. The Council's expenses in this work during the year amounted to Â£60, of which Â£29 was recovered from the estates of the deceased persons. MORTUARY FACILITIES The Council's Mortuary in Sunbury Street is old and is expected -28- to be demolished in the near future as part of the redevelopment scheme for the St. Mary's Area. Following the concentration of Coroner's cases, the Borough Council made arrangements with the Boroughs of Deptford and Lewisham for the provision of mortuary accommodation for persons dying in the Borough. STREET CLEANSING There are 153 miles of roads to be cleansed, of which 15 per cento are swept at least once daily, 20 per cento three to five times weekly, 55 per cent. twice weekly and 10 per cent. once weekly. There are 86 street sweepers employed on the work, and, in addition,a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the roads in the shopping areas adjacent to Powis Street, Plumstead High Street and Eitham High Street. Approximately 9,500 street gulleys are cleansed periodically by mechanical gulley cleansing machines. HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review, 469148 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 51,651 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and Army Barracks. Some 1,800 tons of scrap metal, 300 tons of waste paper and 150 tons of textiles were salvaged and 3,000 yards of clinker sold during the year, producing an income of Â£11,753. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES One additional convenience was opened during the year making a total of 19 conveniences for men and a similar number for women within the Borough. Hours of opening and closing vary with local requirements - in the town centre the conveniences are open from 5o30 a.m. Generally, however, this service is available between the hours of 6030 a.m. and 11 p.m. In all the conveniences the waterciosets are available without charge. FREE WASHING FACILITIES-PUBLIC CONVENIENCES For the past six years the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the publico However, some members of the public still prefer the paid washing facilities which -29- includes the supply of a linen towel. The above information on Street Cleansing, House and Trade Refuse,and Public Conveniences has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. THEATRES AND CINEMAS The routine inspection of the sanitary accommodation at all the cinemas in the Borough was continued during the year. The standard of cleanliness remained good, and it was not found necessary to serve any notices requiring defects or public health nuisances to be remedied. RAG FLOCK There are three premises in the Borough, registered under the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act and one factory licensed under the Act for the manufacture of rag flock. During the year ten samples of filling materials were obtained for analysis. Six .f the samples were .f rag flock, one was or woollen mixture felt and one of cotton felt, and one curled hair and fibre mixture. In each case the sample was satisfactoryo One sample of mill puff (unused raw cotton) failed the test. BOATING AND PADDLING POOLS AND SWIMMING BATHS Routine sampling for bacteriological examination and testing for pH reaction and chlorine content of these waters is carried out by the Health Department. In all, 50 samples of water were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for bacteriological examination, and 52 water tests for chlorine content and pH reaction were carried out. The average result of examinations and tests was as follows:- Probable No. of Bacillus Coli per 100 ml. Average pH value Average Free Chlorine Average Temperature[ Swimming Baths 0 7.63 74Â°9 Paddling and Boating Pools 26 7.87 0.ll - - 30 - PUBLIC BATHS AMD WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes swimming baths, slipper baths, Turkish Baths, Public Laundry and the use of the premises for social and sporting activities during the winter. The demand for the improved Public Laundry service at Plumstead Baths continued to grow, and in the year under review 18,295 people attended, against 12,924 for the previous year; an increase of 5,371. Following the successful conversion of the Woolwich Baths plant to Oil fuel, the Plumstead Baths plant has now also been converted with equal success. The highlight of this year has been the large increases in attendances which have been recorded, and in particular for swimming. In 1950/51, 495,792 attendances were recorded, whereas in 1956/57, the total attendances had risen to 717,139 - an increase of approximately 45 per cento in only six years. This remarkable increase is due mainly to two factors, (l) the televising of swimming events which has increased the interest in this sport, and (2) the greater importance which Education Authorities are placing on the need for children to be able to swim3 A3 evidence of this, 84,600 children attended at the Baths in organised classes in l948/49,and in 1956/57 this figure had jumped to l62,220o The total attendances during the year ended 31st March,1957 were as follows Public Swimming Swimming Tuition School Swimming Slipper Baths Turkish Baths Public Laundry - 332.631 12.166 162.220 139.409 9 9.901 Machine Washing Swimming Clubs Schoolchildren ~ Hand Washing 12.132 6.163 33.134 Cricket School Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed 5.004 Persons 4.379 717,139 - 31 - HEALTH EDUCATION FILM PROGRAMMES AND INFORMAL TALKS A full programme was maintained by the Council's Health Education Unit during the year. One hundred and eighteen sessions of sound films or infoimal talks, or a combination of both, were held throughout the spring, autumn and winter months. Of these, 87 were presented to local organisations in their own meeting places. Nine sessions consisted of informal talks and at five of these films also were shown. Audiences attending totalled nearly 4,700. The subjects of the infomal talks included the "Work of the Health Department"; "Infectious Disease"; "Clean Food"; and "Home Safety". Individual audiences varied considerably in size and the sessions held at old people's clubs continued to attract the greatest numbers. Attendances ranged from 20 to nearly 300 at each session. Once again second visits or even a series of visits were popular, many organisations expressing surprise at the diversity and scope of the work of the Health Department. Several letters of appreciation were received. Programmes take the form of 20 - 30 minutes showing of films devoted to health subjects, followed by items of general interest to complete the hour. The particular type of audience is considered in the choosing of films and every effort is made to present programmes that are pleasantly "interesting as well as educational. Of the 87 shows given to local organisations in their own meeting places, 31 were given to religious organisations,12 to old people's associations and 25 to political bodies. Nineteen programmes were presented to other various types of organisation. 56 sessions were in the afternoon and 31 in the evening. During the Woolwich Trades Fair the opportunity was taken to convert the Health Department Waiting Room into a small cinema with seating accommodation for 25 persons. Two programmes were shown alternately, each stressing the need for and methods of using smokeless fuel in concurrence with the Council's active policy regarding the Clean Air Act. A light-hearted film on accidents in the home was included in each programme and other films of interest were added to give an hour's showing. Programmes were shown continuously throughout the week of the Fair from 2 p.m. to 9PÂ°mÂ°Â» -.32 - in conjunction with the Council's Stand on Clean Air, elsewhere in the fair. Over 600 persons attended, the 31 film shows given during the week. Leaflets and Literature. Leaflets on a variety of subjects are distributed to the publico It is the practice to hand out at Health Education sessions material referring to the subject matter of the films when information may be usefully expanded in this manner,, Other health education material is distributed widely through the Council's libraries and other public buildings,, Wide publicity was given to the coming into force of the Clean Air Act. This is dealt with on page 23 of this Report. HOUSING REPAIRS At the end of 1957s there were estimated to be 41,942 dwellings in the Borougho The number inspected for housing defects under the Public Health or Housing Acts was 4,444 and 1,197 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. A total of 743 houses were rendered fit by informal action by the Public Health Inspectors. This informal action included the service of intimation notices. In 428 instances it was necessary to serve statutory notices in order to ensure the carrying out of the requisite work. House-to-house inspections under the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations, 1925 were continued, the total number of inspections in 1957 being 418. OVERCROWDING During the year 12 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions, and reports were made to the London County Council and to the Borough Council's Housing Department in respect of these persons. A further 70 families were visited after complaints of overcrowding or at the request of the London County Council or the Borough Council Housing Departments, Reports were sent to the Housing Departments setting out details o; the applicantsÂ® present accommodation. - 33 - Upon application being made by either landlord or occupier, the Council are under an obligation to give in writing a statement of the permitted number of persons in respect of any dwelling house, and measurements of dwellings for this purpose were taken on 161 occasions. CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR During the first half of 1957 three applications were received from tenants for the issue of Certificates of Disrepair, under the provisions of the Housing (Repairs and Rents).Act, 1954. In all three cases Certificates were issued to the applicants# Two applications were received from owners for the revocation of Certificates of Disrepair, and on the Health Committee being subsequently satisfied that in each case all the work listed on the Certificate had been satisfactorily carried out, both applications were granted. From the 6th July, 1957 the provisions of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) Act, 1954 relating to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair were repealed, and the Rent Act, 1957 came into operation. The two main effects of the new Act were to free from Rent Control houses and flats above certain levels of rateable value, and to allow limited increases in the rents of houses still under rent control. In connection with applications for Certificates of Disrepair, the new Rent Act changed the procedure. Where fonnerly a local authority could issue a Certificate of Disrepair to an applicant once they were satisfied the condition of the premises warranted such action. it is now necessary in the first instance for the local authority to serve notice on the landlord of their intention to issue a Certificate. A Certificate can only be issued by the local authority if at the end of three weeks from the date of their notice, a landlord has failed to serve notice on the tenant that he undertakes to remedy the defects specified on the Council's notice. Where an undertaking is given by a landlord the Council, with certain exceptions, cannot then issue a Certificate of Disrepair to the applicant. If, however, a landlord has failed at the end of six months from the date of his undertaking to remedy the defects, the tenants' rent can be adjusted so as to have the same effect as if a Certificate of Disrepair had in fact been issued. Details of applications received during the year from tenants for Certificates of Disrepair and from landlords for cancellation of Certificates are as follows:- - 54 - No. of applications for Certificates received or being dealt with 314 No. of Certificate 111 NO. of applications for Certificates reiused 1 NO. of undertakings to remedy defects, received from landlords 122 No. of applications from landlords for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair 5 NoÂ® of Certificates of Disrepair cancelled, 2 INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES Apart from the Council's action with regard to the declaration of clearance areas in the Borough, 16 individual unfit houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation, and not capable of being made fit at reasonable expense. The Council made one Demolition Order and 15 Closing Orders in respect of the undermentioned propertiess- Demolition Order - 93 Woodrow Closing Orders - 52 Woodhill 34 Southend Crescent 31 Bramblebury Road 115 Villas Road 101 Ann Street 16 Mabyn Road 2 King's Highway 41 Villas Road 43 Villas Road 40 Woodrow 61 Brookhill Road 18 Merchland Road 11, 12 and 13 Whitworth Placeo A further six individual unfit houses had been represented to the Council at the end of the year for demolition or closure. - 35 - In addition, the Council made Closing Orders in respect of unfit rooms at a further eight houses, as follows:- 223 Maxey Road (Basement rooms) 1 Waverley Road (Ground floor back addition, back addition extra room and first floor front, back and back addition rooms) 84 Plumstead Common Road (Front and back east and west rooms on the lower ground floor, front and back west rooms and watercloset on the ground floor) 210 Maxey Road (Lower ground floor front room and passage, but allowing storage). 1 Fennell Street (Basement front and back rooms) 228 Plumstead High Street (First floor front and back rooms and ground floor scullery) 27 Tewson Road (Basement front and back rooms and basement scullery) 10 Woolwich Common (Basement front and back rooms). During the year the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of 1 Maxey Road and 127 Abbey Wood Road on the satisfactory completion of work to make these houses again fit. I also represented to the Council that the dwelling houses 36 Coupland Terrace and 161 Griffin Road were unfit for habitation, but capable of being made fit at reasonable expense, Notices under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1957 were served to secure the repair of these premises,, SLUM CLEARANCE CLEARANCE AREAS The Council's slum clearance programme was earried a stage further during 1957 Details of the work carried out during this period are as follows:- Samuel Street (No., 1) Areas (53 houses) the following dwelling houses;- This area comprises 71-83 (odd) Samuel Street 87â119 (odd) Samuel Street 129-141 (odd) Samuel Street 71-113 (odd) Frances Street - 36 - The Clearance Order was made by the Council in May, 1956 and was confirmed by the Minister on the 25th January, 1957.

There are 100 dwelling houses in the above-mentioned four areas. In addition, there are approximately 60 properties on adjoining land which are not considered representable but which it is necessary for the Council to acquire in order to obtain a cleared site of convenient shape and dimensions for the satisfactory redevelopment of these clearance areas. These added lands include, in addition to dwellinghouses, a number of retail shops, a warehouse, coal yard, Doctor's surgery and a public house. The Council propose to redevelop this area at a density of about 100 persons per acre. This development will constitute the first stage of the Glyndon Area Scheme. Confirmation of these Orders was awaited at the end of the year. London County Council Clearance Areas.

At the end of the year the first stage of the Government's Building Scheme for army accommodation in Woolwich was commenced - 38 - with the demolition of a number of centre squares of the R.A. Barracks, which will be replaced by ten three-storey barrack blocks. The total cost of this redevelopment scheme is likely to be about Â£1,600,00O. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Owners wishing to modernize and provide additional facilities by way of improvement and conversion of their houses may apply to the Council for a grant towards the cost of the works If the Council are satisfied that the work when completed will comply with the 12 point standard of fitness specified by the Housing Act, 1949, as amended, the Council may make such a grant to assist the owner. The dwelling must after improvement or conversions:- l. be in a good 3tate of repair and substantially free from damp; 2. have each room properly lighted and ventilated; 3. have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on inside the dwelling; 4. be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes. 5. have an internal or otherwise readily accessible watercloset; 6. have a fixed bath (or shower) preferably in a separate room? 7. be provided with a sink or sinks and with suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; 8. have a proper drainage system; 9. be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available)? 10. be provided with adequate facilities for heating? 11. have satisfactory facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food? 12. have proper provision for the storage of fuel (where required). The dwelling must provide satisfactory accommodation for more than 15 years. Normally the Council make a maximum grant of half of the cost of the approved work. The local authority is empowered to fix the maximum rents which may be charged for such dwellings. All applications for improvement grants which are submitted to the Borough Treasurer are referred to the Health Department to determine whether the proposed work will satisfy the above standards. - 39 - The majority of applications received during the year were in respect of the provision of bathrooms, internal waterclosets, and hot water systemsÂ® Visits are also made and preliminary advice given to owners concerning proposed improvement and conversion schemes. The number of visits in connection with improvement grants during the year totalled 172, being twice as many as during the previous year. HOUSING PROGRESS The number of dwellings built in the Borough of Woolwich during the year 1957 may be summarised as follows:- By the Borough Council 271 By the London County Council 55 By private enterprise 58 384 In addition, at the end of the year there were a further 417 dwellings under construction by the Borough Council. In the St. Mary's Area, under the Comprehensive Development Scheme, 459 families, comprising 1,331 persons, had been rehoused from the area by the end of 1957, and 295 new dwellings erected and occupied since building first commenced in 1952. Redevelopment continues and detailed plans have been approved, and the schemes likely to commence in the near future include multi-storey blocks of flats. Progress has been made in the Glyndon Area, a tentative layout has been prepared, and the first rehousings from this Area have taken place. The year under review saw the completion of the Coldharbour Estate which was celebrated by a visit from Her Majesty the Queen Mother in May, when she graciously performed a ceremony in connection therewith. The Housing Committee has also approved schemes in other parts of the Borough, which will allow for the clearance and redevelopment of Temporary Dwelling sites, and a start was made in 1957 in the Abbey Wood Area, and as a result the building operations on the Bostall Estate were continued. Some other smaller sites in the Borough were also built upon. - 40 - INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED AND OFFERED FOR SALE A total of 2,342 inspections of food premises was carried out during the year. Details of the registered food premises at the end of 1957, together with numbers of inspections carried out during the year, are as follows:- TABLE No. 12 Description No. in Borough on 31.12.1957 No. of Inspections. Dairies 1 9 Distributors of Milk 130 222 Ice-cream Premises 319 637 Premises where meat is potted, pickled, pressed and preserved 101 83 Premises where Sausages are manufactured 86 98 Premises where fish is cured or prepared for frying 39 38 Wholesale dealer in Margarine 1 1 Restaurants, cafes and snack bars 185 412 Industrial and School Meals Service canteens 99 192 Markets 1 Daily Bakehouses 12 15 Itinerant vendors â 14 Non-registered premises â 288 Greengrocery and fish shops â 126 Public Houses 146 207 - 41 - FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS - ISSUE OF CERTIFICATES OF EXEMPTION During the year the Council issued Exemption Certificates in respect of 15 kiosks exempting them from the necessity of providing a piped water supply and wash-hand basin. The goods sold at these premises were predominantly pre-packed, and because of the special circumstances, including the restricted accommodation, and the situation of the premises, the Council considered that it would be unreasonable to insist on a piped water supply. PUBLIC HOUSES There are 146 licensed premises in the Borough, of which 30 serve main meals. During the year 207 inspections were carried out, special regard being had to the requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations. In 19 cases washing facilities were found to be inadequate and in each case the Brewers agreed to instal additional facilities in order to comply with the requirements of the Regulations MILK SUPPLY Within the Borough at the end of the year there was one dairy and 132 registered distributors of milk. The Council also approved registration of a further 29 distributors of milk who sell milk within the Borough from premises outside. A total of 230 dealers' licences and 76 supplementary licences were issued under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949 authorising the use of the special designations "Pasteurised", "Tuberculin Tested" and "Sterilised". Samples of milk were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. The percentage of fat content was:- Fat Content No. of Samples 4.5 per cent. and over 5 4.0 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 19 3.5 per cent. and under 4.0 per cento 142 3.0 per cento and under 3.5 per cent. 109 Below 3 per cent. 0 - 42 - During 1957, 195 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised" milk were subjected to the Methylene Blue test at the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, to assess the keeping quality of the milk. All the samples were reported satisfactory. A further 195 samples of "Pasteurised" or "Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised" milk were submitted for the Phosphatase test to determine the adequacy of pasteurisation. All the samples were reported to be satisfactory. Twenty-five samples of "Sterilised" or "Tuberculin Tested Sterilised" milk were submitted to the Park Hospital for Turbidity test and satisfactory results were reported in each case. The tests referred to above are those prescribed in the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949. The practice of taking samples of milk in the course of delivery to schools, hospitals and institutions in the Borough was continued during the year Of the 19 samples taken, seven were submitted for the Phosphatase test, and 12 for the Methylene Blue test, all of which were satisfactory. Routine visits to the premises of milk distributors were carried out during the year, and in no case was it found necessary to serve notice to secure the remedying of defects. ICE-CREAM There were 319 registered ice-cream premises in the Borough at the end of the year, of which four were used for the manufacture of ice-cream and six for the storage of ice-cream. Pre-packed ice-cream only is sold from the majority of these premises. Routine inspections of all registered shops are made, and during the year three defects were found and subsequently remedied following the service of informal notices. The premises of each new applicant for registration are inspected in order to ensure that they are satisfactory and that the requirements of the Heat Treatment Regulations are fully understood. During the year twelve samples of ice-cream were submitted - 43 - to the Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue Test. The results of the tests indicated that eleven of the samples were in Grade I and one in Grade II. UNSOUND FOOD - COMPLAINTS Some 50 complaints of alleged unsound food were brought to the direct notice of the Health Department during the year by members of the public who had purchased the food from local shops. All the complaints were fully investigated and a great deal of time was spent by the Food Inspectors to ensure that all justified complaints were carefully looked into, and to see that any defects at the food premises or bad practices by food handlers were rectified. Legal proceedings were taken by the Council during the year in respect of the following offences: Glass in Milk (two complaints) - the firm was fined Â£5 in each case, with Â£5.5.0d. costs; Cheese contaminated by tobacco - firm fined Â£2 and Â£2.2.0d. costs. The Manager of the same shop was fined Â£2.2.0d. for permitting refuse to accumulate in a food room, the Council's Food Inspector having reported that he saw cigarette ends and other sweepings on the floor of the food preparation room. Among other serious offences dealt with during the year was that of metal in a mincemeat pie which was found whilst the complainant was eating the pie. The manufacturers explained that a metal tray was discovered by them in the Pie Department and one of the reinforcing rims had broken away from the main rim and had been soldered by a member of the staff. This rim had then broken off. A further complaint concerned wire in a bread roll. It appeared that the wire had its origin in a wire brush, but no such bush had been discovered by the bakers. With regard to a complaint of a safety pin in cake. the complainant had found an open safety pin sticking out of the cake which she was about to eat. Fortunately no one suffered injury. The bakers explained that they had no idea where the pin could have come from and that protective clothing worn by the workers in the bakehouse was specially made without pockets. When some canvas sacking was found in bread crust, this canvas was said by the bakers to be part of one of the dough proving bags used in the bakery. Warning letters were sent to the manufacturers in all the above cases, and also in respect of complaints of wood in a jar of cherry jam, wood in breads, and glass in lemon curd. Other complaints investigated included mould on a bread roll, oil or other stains in bread (five cases), foreign matter in bread (three cases), pin in bread, unfit pies (-three cases), maggots in -44- confectionery, sausage rolls, cake mixture and tomatoes, dirty milk bottles (two cases), unfit chocolates, semolina, pears, sauce and liver, The following foods, which had been the subject of complaint were found to be not unfits meat pie (the allegedly contaminated part was found to be fat); eggs, meat, cheese and lemonade, which proved satisfactory on laboratory test. UNSOUND FOOD: EXAMINATION OF FOOD SUSPECTED OF BEING UNSOUND The routine examination of food suspected of being unsound was continued throughout the year. Here the co-operation of the food traders is, of course, very important, and numerous requests are received from traders for an inspection of suspected foodstuffs. If found to be unfit the food is voluntarily surrendered and Condemnation Certificates issued. Altogether, 31,795 articles of food, weighing approximately 65 tons were condemned as unfit during the year, the majority of these articles, weighing approximately 53 tons, being from the large Abattoir in the Borough. LICENSING OF SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND SLAUGHTERMEN There are two licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough, one being the Garland Road Abattoir through which large numbers of animals pass each year. The other in Herbert Road is not being used at the present time. Seven slaughtermen's licences were issued by the Council during the year to men working at the Garland Road Abattoir. MEAT INSPECTION During 1957, 479 cows were slaughtered, 435 of which were for export to Italy, About 1,500 New Zealand lamb carcases were reconditioned at a cold 3tore in the Borough; the carcases had been damaged as a result of a collision in the Panama Canal, Only a small number of the carcases so damaged were found unfit for human food, Whilst fewer calves were inspected in 1957, over 11,000 more pigs and nearly 7,000 more sheep and lambs were inspected than in the previous year. - 45 - Details of the carcases inspected at the Garland Road Abattoir during 1957 are as follows:- TABLE No.13 Carcases & Offal Inspected and Condemned in Whole or in Part, 1957 Cattle exÂ¬- cluding Cows.

Of these, 22 informal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements giving a percentage of 2.2 compared with 4.0 in 1956, and 5.0 in 1955. One private sample was examined during the year. - 46 - The following table gives details of the adulterated samples:- TABLE No. 14 Sample Article Formal or Infoimal (F or I) Adulteration or Irregularity. 438 Romany Soup I Contained potato powder 25 per cent.; not disclosed on the label. 579 Marzipan I Sample at least 10 per cento deficient in ground almonds. 508) 635) 637) 638) Plain Flour I All samples deficient in creta praeparata. 486 Popcorns I Included flavouring; not disclosed on the label. 590 Desiccated Coconut I Contained sulphur dioxide, an added preservative, 641 Coconut and Biscuit Fragments I Contained small fragments of broken glass, 642 Marshmallow Biscuit I Contained broken glass, 339 Canned Beef Sausages, I Ingredients included artificial casings, the presence of which was not disclosed on the label, 295 Canned Prunes in Syrup I Tin excessive, 276 Banana Flavouring I Contained benzoic acid (an added preservative) which is not permitted in colouring or flavouring matters. 383 Orange Colouring I -ditto- 9 Cherry bark Throat Pastilles I No Cherry bark round in sample. 177 Canned Pork Luncheon Meat I Contained 55 per cent. meats, being 20 per cent. less than the usual amount round in similar products. -47- 28 Canned Stewed Steak I Contained a large piece of inedible connective tissue. 686 Celery Soup Mixture I Contained Cornflour 15 per cent., the presence of which was not disclosed on the label. 508 Uncooked Flaky Pastry I Slightly mouldy. 504 Influenza Mixture I Contained chloroform not disclosed on the label. 755 Canned Sterilised Cream I Excessive lactose and mineral matter indicating this was not genuine cream. 519 Orange Colouring I Contained benzoic acid (an added preservative) which is not permitted in colouring matters.

Infectious diseases notified to the Department are visited by the Public Health Inspectors at the earliest opportunity and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable Where the patient is nursed at home, Public Health Inspectors visit to see that home isolation is carried out satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding and other articles belonging to the patient are removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the rooms sealed and fumigated. FOOD POISONING One outbreak of food poisoning occurred in the Borough during 1957. This took place during the first week of July when the temperature was very high, and involved over 100 persons - members of families who had consumed ham and other cooked meats sold from a local shop. Six patients received hospital treatment. Extensive investigations were carried out by the Council's Food Inspectors, full enquiries being made of each household and pathological reports obtained. The source of infection was traced to a food handler, who although quite well, was harbouring harmful bacteria in the nasopharynx. This handler was immediately transferred to other work away from open food until shown to be clear. DIPHTHERIA Two youths and two young women were removed to hospital for observation during the year as possible cases of diphtheria, but no confirmed cases were reported. Two of the patients were found to be suffering from tonsillitis, a third from chicken pox and a fourth from glandular fever. SONNE DYSENTERY Whereas in the previous year there were 524 notified cases,in 1957 only one serious outbreak occurred and the total notified cases - 49 - for the whole year dropped to 100. The outbreak occurred early in the year at a local institution and involved 26 patients and lasted about three weeks. A full investigation was carried out by officers of the Health Department.

Six of the confirmed cases were found to be of the paralytic type and three non-paralytic. Altogether, 31 Woolwich cases were removed to hospital during the year as possible cases of poliomyelitis. After correction of diagnosis, it was found that three had pneumonia, three tonsillitis, three ?Influenza, two osteomyelitis and one each had ?rheumatism, arthritis and pyrexia of undetermined origin. Dr.F.R. Waldron, the County Council Divisional Medical Officer of Health for Division 6 (comprising the Boroughs of Woolwich,Greenwich, - 50 - and Deptford) has informed me that nearly 16,000 children in the Division who were born during the years 1947â1954 were registered for inoculation against poliomyelitis during the year 1956. In 1957 there have been 6,943 registrations of children born in 1955 and 1956, and of those children born between 1947 and 1954 whose parents had not taken advantage of the previous offer of inoculation. Inoculations have continued as far as supplies of vaccine would allow, and all children registered in 1956 had been offered inoculation by the end of the year 1957Â° MEASLES Measles accounted for by far the greatest number of notifications of infectious diseases (totalling 1,384), Nearly half of the cases of measles related to children under five years, and almost all the remainder to children between 5 and 10 years. Fifty-two patients were admitted to hospital. TUBERCULOSIS Medical Practitioners are required to notify to the local Medical Officer of Health all new cases of tuberculosis coming to their knowledge. The staff of the Health Department have duties regarding the prevention of the spread of infection. During the year 145 new cases were officially notified to the Health Department, the lowest annual number of new cases on record. Full investigation and treatment is undertaken by the local Chest Physician and her staff. The local Chest Clinics are situated at Maxey Road, Plumstead. and at Carnecke Gardens, Eltham. Reports on patients found to be living in unsatisfactory conditions are made to the Borough Council and to the County Council Housing Departments, recommending priority rehousing where necessary.

The signatures on these certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a doctor practising within the area. During the year, 541 certificates were authenticated by me. Of these, 511 related to protection against smallpox, 17 to cholera, and 13 to typhoid fever. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION During 1957 the Department disinfected 190 rooms on account of infectious diseases, and of these 32 rooms had been occupied by tuberculous persons. A total of 1,466 inspections for verminous conditions were made and 150 rooms were disinfested for vermin. - 53 - Requests were again received from residents in the Borough wishing to dispose of unwanted bedding and furniture. Generally, this bedding and furniture was in a dirty and often in a verminous condition, and bad formerly been used by persons removed to hospitals or institutions, or deceased. In thirty-two instances such articles were removed to and destroyed at the Plumstead Destructor, the number of articles destroyed totalling 270. Of this total, 31 were mattresses, 20 bedsteads, 34 sets of bedding, 104 items of furniture and 81 other sundry items, Three residents requested Certificates of Disinfection to accompany new clothing sent to friends and relatives abroad. The clothing concerned was disinfected by the Department and certificates were issued in each case. A local laundry, which washes, cleanses, and sterilizes rag wipers, requested the issue of Certificates of Hygiene to accompany three consignments of wipers. The certificates were granted in each case, small charges being made. LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Park Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service on behalf of the Medical Research Council. Specimens sent to this laboratory include samples of milk and ice-cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the Abattoir and samples of swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the laboratory on behalf of the Council during 19578:- Type of Specimen No. examined Food (various) 6 Ice-cream (methylene blue test) 12 Milk (methylene blue, phosphatase and turbidity tests) 239 Water (swimming baths, children's paddling and boating pools) 44 Processed Bovine Blood plasma 3 Organs from animal carcases 5 Beer glass (for Tuberculosis culture) 1 Eye swab 1 The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the hospital from local clinics, is undertaken -54- by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee at the Brook Hospital and at St. Nicholas Hospital. General practitioners referred 17 sputum specimens for examination, and the hospital carried out 73 other sputum examinations during the year. 12 nasal and throat swabs were referred to the hospital by general practitioners for examination. It is an advantage to all concerned to have a service of this nature conveniently available within the Borough.
