In the Annual Report for last year the proceedings taken by the Board for the amendment of this Act during its progress through Parliament were described, and it was stated that the Board had submitted to the Local Government Board for their sanction draft bye-laws proposed to be made under the provisions of the Act upon the following matters, viz.:— 1.—For securing the cleanliness and freedom from pollution of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles used for storing of water used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man. 2.—With respect to the keeping of water closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. 3.—For the prevention of nuisances arising from any snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or other matter or thing in any street. 4.—For preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knackers' yard, butchers' or fishmongers' shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence. 12 5.—For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises so as to bo a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. 6.—As to the paving of yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling-houses. 7.—With respect to tents, vans, sheds, and similar structures used for human habitation. The Local Government Board, having considered draft bye-laws on the same subjects submitted by the other Sanitary Authorities in London, have just issued revised model bye-laws upon the subjects numbered 1 to 6 which they recommend for adoption. These are now under the consideration of this Board. The Local Government Board have not yet come to a decision with regard to the proposed bye-laws with respect to tents and vans. During the year under report the Board have considered draft bye-laws prepared by the London County Council under sections 16 and 39 of the same Act. The suggestions of the Board thereon were forwarded to the Council and several of them were adopted. Some of the suggestions, however, which were considered by the Board to be important were not adopted, and the Board have therefore requested the Local Government Board to consider them with the view of making the suggested amendments before sanctioning the bye-laws. The Board have also submitted to the Local Government Board for their sanction, as required by the Act, draft byelaws with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and are awaiting the decision of such Board thereon. This Board have for many years had in operation a system of house to house inspection in their District, have recorded the results of the inspections, and taken the necessary steps for remedying the sanitary defects discovered. They have therefore practically met the object of these bye-laws, and until the passing of the Act made it compulsory the 13 Board refrained from making any bye-laws on the subject, as they did not approve of the application of a more stringent law to a house simply because lodgers are received into it. As was anticipated, the Act has cast great additional work and expense upon Sanitary Authorities. For instance the expenditure by the Board for disinfecting purposes during the past year was £823 17s 9d., against £272 10s. for the previous year. Factory and Workshop Acts. Under the provisions of these Acts an order issued by the Home Secretary came into force in November last requiring the occupier of every factory and workshop engaged in the following businesses, viz.:— The manufacture of articles of wearing apparel; The manufacture of electro-plate; Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work; The manufacture of files; to keep lists containing particulars of persons employed outside the factory or workshop. The object of the order is that frequent inspections should be made of the places (usually the outworkers' dwellings) in which outworkers in the trades in question carry on their work so that prompt measures may be taken to deal with any sanitary defects there. The Board have given instructions for the lists to be examined by their officers, and notice given to the Sanitary Authorities of other Districts of persons residing in such Districts who do work for factories, &c., in this District. They have also addressed a communication to all the Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolis asking them to furnish the Board in the same way Avith the names and addresses of persons residing in this District who do work for factories, &c., situate iu other Sanitary Districts. Most of the Sanitary Authorities written to have promised to do so, and thus co-operate in carrying the order into effect. 14 Cholera. During the past year the Board have given much attention to the question of the measures of a precautionary character which should be adopted in view of the possible introduction of cholera into London. In September last a notice drawn up by the Medical Officers of Health containing advice as to steps to be taken for the prevention of cholera, and for dealing with cases should any occur, was printed, and a copy thereof left at every house in the District. The Board have since communicated with all the medical practitioners in the District with the view of arrangements being made for immediate medical attendance and medicine being given free to the poorer inhabitants of the District who may suffer from diarrhoea or cholera. They are also making arrangements for the erection of temporary hospitals for the sick and for providing places of shelter for the residents of houses where cases of the disease may occur, and the patients cannot be removed. Further particulars on this subject will be found in the annual report of the Medical Officers of Health. Proposed Fever Hospital at Tooting. The Metropolitan Asylums Board decided in January last to purchase, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, the Tooting Lodge Estate facing Tooting Common for the purpose of erecting thereon a fever hospital. Only a year ago the Board contributed £1,676, and residents in the locality subscribed £1,800, towards the cost of purchasing a piece of land covered with a fine grove of trees which adjoined this Common to add it to the Common. Having regard to the enormous number of persons who now resort to Tooting Common for recreative purposes the Board felt that the site chosen was a most unsuitable one, and they therefore opposed the scheme. There was also very strong opposition from the residents in the locality. A public inquiry into the proposal was held by the Local Government Board at the Tooting Vestry Hall on the 15 7th and 8th of March, when evidence against the scheme was given by the Board and others. The Local Government Board finally decided not to sanction the proposal. Footpath at Wandsworth Common and Widening East Hill. In the last annual report reference was made to an application by the Authorities of Magdalen College, Oxford, to stop up the footpath between Magdalen Road and Wandsworth Common. The matter then fell through owing to the refusal of the Wandsworth Vestry to assent to the proposal. The application was renewed this year, and after negotiations an agreement was entered into between the College and this Board, the former agreeing to widen the road in front of the College property at the corner of East Hill, Wandsworth Common, to 55 feet at East Hill and to 40 feet facing Wandsworth Common, upon the expiration of the existing leases at Michaelmas, 1894; also to preserve the trees now standing along the side of the proposed extension of Lyford Road, and to build the houses there with their fronts to the Common. The Board undertook to set back the walls, &c., at East Hill and Wandsworth Common and make up the road and footpath there; and further, not to require the College to form a footpath on the side of Lyford Road next the Common, and not to prevent free access from the houses there to the Common. The Wandsworth Vestry thereupon consented to the stopping up of the footpath, and the formal order therefor has since been made at Quarter Sessions. The arrangement made with the College will complete a great improvement at East Hill which the Board commenced last year by arranging a give-and-take line with the owner of the Bramblebury estate, by which the portion of East Hill in front of that estate was made of an uniform width of 55 feet. Stopping up Streets at Clapham. An application having been received from the solicitors to the Rector of Clapham for stopping up 16 the streets and passages on the Glebe Estate, Bromell's Road, the Board in forwarding notice thereof to the Vestry of Clapham suggested that as the closing of the streets would cause the removal of a great many houses in the occupation of working people, provision for housing the persons displaced should bo made before the streets, &c., were allowed to be stopped up. The matter is still under the consideration of the Clapham Vestry. The plan of the roads proposed to be formed on the estate has been approved by the London County Council. The scheme would no doubt effect a considerable improvement, the streets and passages on the site being very narrow and inconvenient, the houses old, and the locality over-crowded. Land given up in front of Houses to be added to the public way. The Board have several times had under consideration the inconvenience and unfairness arising from the operation of the existing law with regard to the general line of buildings. The London County Council have power, in giving their consent to the erection of a building in advance of the general line, to make conditions as to land being given up in front for the purpose of widening the public way. Having, however, given their consent to buildings upon these terms a general line is formed by such buildings. Consequently the owner of the adjoining land may, without the consent of the Council build up to such line, and there is no power to insist upon the land in front of his buildings being given up. During the past year a case occurred in this District in which the adjoining owner proceeded to build immediately the new general line next his property was formed, and declined to give up the strip of land corresponding to that which had been given up by his neighbour except by sale upon his terms. The Board called the attention of the London County Council to the matter, and a clause has now been drafted in 17 sultation between the Council and the Board, for insertion in one of the Council's Bills, to deal with land belonging to adjoining owners under such circumstances. South Western Police Court. The efforts which this Board made, extending over many years, to secure the establishment of a new Police Court in the locality of Clapham Junction at length resulted in the erection at Lavender Hill of a suitable building for the purpose, which was opened during the past year. The arrangements for the conduct of business, however, are still inadequate, as there is only one regular Magistrate assigned to the Court. The Board therefore took the opportunity of the appointment of a Departmental Committee to enquire into the proper number and limits of the Police Court districts of the Metropolis and the arrangements for the service of such courts by the Magistrates to present a memorial to the Home Secretary on the subject. The following extracts from the memorial explain the grievances of which the Board complain, viz.:— That in carrying out the duties of your Memorialists it is very frequently necessary for several of their officers to be in attendance at the South Western Police Court, and your Memorialists are informed that groat inconvenience and delay in the transaction of business arises in consequence of there being only one Magistrate permanently attached to such Court, such Magistrate being assisted by Magistrates from other Courts, on days which vary according to the arrangements which the Magistrates may find it necessary to make for the transaction of business generally. That the business of your Memorialists at the Police Court is of a special character, and, in a great degree, consists of matters which do not come before Magistrates sitting at courts in Central London, and in consequence the Magistrates who occasionally attend from the more central courts are sometimes reluctant to deal with the cases in which proceedings are being taken by your Memorialists. Many of these cases are of great importance, and occupy considerable time in the hearing of evidence and the arguments of counsel, and when, as frequently happens, the hearing of such cases has to be adjourned, great difficulty is experienced in fixing upon days for the adjournment, as it is uncertain when the Magistrate who has begun the case will again be in attendance. Further, when summonses have been heard and determined by a Magistrate, the orders which are made by him in the matter, and which have to be served upon the defendants before they take effect, sometimes remain at the court for a long time to be signed, as this must be done by the Magistrate who heard the case. B 18 That many of the cases of your Memorialists are proceedings taken under the Sanitary Acts, and your Memorialists submit that great danger to the public health arises from delay in prosecuting and effectually dealing with offenders in such matters. Your Memorialists desire to express their opinion that every possible facility is given at the Police Court for the conduct of business, but that it is quite impossible with the present arrangements, to secure the prompt and satisfactory administration of justice. The Departmental Committee came to the conclusion that it is impossible without injustice to accused persons and the public to work any court with less than a permanent staff of two magistrates, and they recommended that two additional magistrates should be appointed at once, as in their opinion the evil was a pressing one. It is understood that the two additional magistrates will be assigned—one to the South Western Court and the other to the North London Court. They have not yet, however, been appointed, and the Board are pressing the Home Secretary to carry out the recommendation of the Departmental Committee. Electric Lighting. All the Electric Lighting Orders relating to this District which had been granted up to the Session of 1892 have been successively revoked by the Board of Trade, no practical steps having been taken to carry them into effect. In the Session of 1892 an order promoted by the County of London Electric Lighting Company, Limited, was introduced into Parliament authorising the Company to supply electricity throughout the District. Tho Board settled with the promoters the list of streets in which distributing mains were to be laid within a limited period, and other details, and the order became law on the 28th June, 1892. The Company have not yet, however, commenced operations in the District, and the Board are now in communication with the Board of Trade on the subject. 19 Bills in Parliament. The following Bills, which have been introduced in. the present Session, have been considered by the Board, viz.:— Crystal Palace District Gas. City and South London Railway (Extension of Time). Local Authorities (Voting and Qualification). Local Government (England and Wales). London County Council (General Powers). London Equalisation of Kates. London Improvements. London Markets. London Open Spaces. London Owners Improvement Rate. London Streets (Removal of Gates, Bars, &c.) Public Health (London). Registration of Electors (Amendment). Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), &c., Amendment. Sanitary Registration. Vestrymen's Qualification. The Board decided not to oppose the extension from 1S95 to 1898 of the time allowed to the City and South London Railway Company by their Act of 1890 for the completion of their proposed line to Clapham. The Board presented a petition to Parliament against the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, as they were of opinion that the provisions of the Bill would place in the hands of the Council powers of a highly inquisitorial nature which would lead to disputes with the Bating Authorities. The Board also objected to the clause in the Bill which would authorise the Council to maintain public bands or to make contributions by way of subsidy to provide music in any place in the County, the Board being of opinion that the powers already possessed by the Council with regard to the provision of bands are ample for all reasonable purposes. The London Equalisation of Bates Bill has only just been introduced into the House of Commons by the B 2 20 President of the Local Government Board, and it is now under the consideration of this Board. The following report on the Bill was made to the General Purposes Committee by the Clerk, viz.:— Clause 1 (') of this Bill provides that the London County Council shall in every year form a fund, to be called the Equalisation Fund, equal to a rate of 6d. in the £ on the rateable value of London. Clause 1 (2) provides that the London County Council shall determine half-yearly the contribution from each parish to one-half of the Equalisation Fund and the grant due from that one-half of the Fund to each parish. Clause 1 (3) provides that the contribution among the parishes is to be determined in proportion to their rateable value. Clause 1 (4) provides that the grant due shall be determined by apportioning the amount of half the Equalisation Fund among the sanitary districts in proportion to their population, and where a sanitary district comprises two or more parishes by dividing that grant among those parishes in proportion to their population; with this exception, that where the aggregate of the contributions from the parishes in the district is less than the grant apportioned to the district the difference shall be paid out of the Equalisation Fund to the sanitary authority of the district, and no payment towards any equalisation charge shall be required from any parish in the district. Clause 1 (5) provides that, subject as aforesaid, where the contribution from a parish is less than the grant due, the difference shall be paid out of the Equalisation Fund to the sanitary authority of the district forming or comprising the parish, but if it exceeds the grant duo to the parish the Council shall levy on the parish a contribution (called the Equalisation charge) as a separate item of the County Rate. Clause 1 (6) provides that the sums paid to a sanitary authority shall be applied in defraying expenses incurred under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and so far as not required for that purpose those incurred in respect of lighting, and so far as not required for that purpose those incurred in respect of streets. Where the district of the sanitary authority (as in the case of this Board) comprises two or more parishes, the sum paid is to be apportioned among the parishes in proportion to their population, the amount so apportioned being credited to the parish in reduction of the rates required from such parish. Clause 3 authorizes the Local Government Board to prescribe the forms of contribution orders, &c. Clause 3 provides that the Act shall come into operation on the 30th September next, and that the amount of half the Equalisation Fund for the half-year begun on that day shall be equal to 3d. in the £. 21 The rateable value of London according to the Valuation List now in force is £33,542,457, and the rateable value of this district £1,092,730. The population of London according to the preliminary Report of the Census of 1891 was 4,211,056, and the population of this district 156,931. The effect of the Bill in this district for one year, upon the basis of the foregoing figures, is shown in the following tabular statement:— PARISHES. Amount of Rate at 6d. on rateable value. Amount of grant based upon population. Difference. In favour. Against. £ £ £ £ Clapham 6951 8660 1709 .. Putney 4148 3522 .. 626 Streatham 8484 8513 29 . Tooting 711 1146 435 .. Wandsworth 7024 9258 2234 .. Total £27318 £31099 4407 Less 626 £626 £3781 The foregoing sum of £3,781 would bo paid to this Board by the County Council. The apportionment thereof in accordance with the provisions of Clause 1 (6) would be as follows, viz.: Parish of Clapham, £1,053; Putney, £428; Streatham, £1,035; Tooting, £139; Wandsworth, £1126. No rate for the purposes of the Act would bo mado in any of the parishes in this district. The Board petitioned against the provisions of the London Improvements Bill, which proposed to enable the County Council to make a new central street and streets in connection therewith from Holborn to the Strand, and to levy an improvement charge upon the adjoining property. The Board objected to the formation of the proposed street, as in their opinion the improvement to be effected thereby would not be at all commensurate with its immense cost. This was estimated at nearly four millions, which might in course of time be reduced by recoupment to two-and-a-half millions. The Board also objected to the manner in which the proposed improvement charge was to be 22 levied, and expressed the opinion that the scheme was impracticable, and that even if it could be carried out it would be costly, cumbrous, and inequitable. The London Owners' Improvement Rate Bill, introduced by the London County Council, was withdrawn, the Speaker having decided that it could not be proceeded with as a private Bill. It proposed to authorise the Council to levy a rate of not exceeding fourpence in the £ for the purpose of defraying one-half of the cost of improvements, the rate to be paid in the first instance by the occupier and deducted by him from his rent. The only provision in the London Streets (Removal of Gates, Bars, &c.) Bill affecting this District was that which authorised the Council to remove a bar across Beechcroft Road, Streatham. As soon as the Parliamentary plan was deposited, the Board placed themselves in communication with the owner of the gate (Miss Bell), who readily undertook to remove it, and no Parliamentary powers in the matter were therefore required. The object of the Sale of Pood, &c., Acts Amendment Bill was to extend the provisions of these Acts to the wholesale trader and manufacturer. The Board, however, whilst fully agreeing with this object, were of opinion that the provisions of the Bill would not only fail to meet it, but would create additional obstruction to the carrying out of the law. They therefore petitioned against the Bill, pointed out the amendments which they thought would improve the existing Acts, and suggested that a Select Committee of the House of Commons should be appointed to consider the matter. The Bill has not vet reached the second reading. 23 The Vestrymen's Qualification Bill proposes to abolish the ratal qualification for Members of Vestries, and the Board petitioned against it. The Board took no action with regard to the other Bills above mentioned. Priory Lane, Roehampton, and Richmond Park. Owing to a question put in the House of Commons by Sir Richard Temple on the 6th February, the First Commissioner of Works communicated with the Board with the view of the opening of Priory Lane, Roehampton, to vehicles as an approach to Richmond Park. It was ascertained that the owner of the lane was willing to allow it to be converted into a public road without compensation, and the Office of Works stated that whilst they could not ask Parliament to provide funds for a service outside the property of the Department they would maintain the road inside the park and the gate at Priory Lane. The Board were of opinion that the opening of this proposed new approach to Richmond Park would be a Metropolitan improvement, and that the first cost thereof should bo borne by the whole of London, but expressed their willingness to undertake the lighting, watering, cleansing, and maintenance of the lane if the London County Council would make it up and remove the two lodges which now stand on the lane. This, however, the Council declined to do, stating that it was doubtful whether the opening of Priory Lane for vehicular traffic would benefit any large portion of London, and that the Council hesitated to incur an expense of some £11,000 or £12,000 in forming an approach to a park which was not under their control. The proposal has therefore for the present fallen through. Government of London. The promised District Councils Bill, referred to in the last annual report, has not yet been introduced 24 into Parliament. In April last a Royal Commission, consisting of the Right Hon. Leonard II. Courtney, M.P., Sir Thos. Henry Earrer, Bart., L.C.C., Mr. R. D. Holt (Mayor of Liverpool), Mr. II. H. Crawford (Solicitor, Corporation of the City of London), and Mr. E. O. SMirn (Town Clerk, Birmingham), was appointed" to consider the proper conditions under which the amalgamation of the City and County of London can be effected, and to make specific and practical proposals for that purpose." The Commission has just held its first meeting. Resignations of Officers. During the past year Mr. Anthony Dobson, who had been Surveyor for the parish of Wandsworth 28 years, and Mr. James Barber, who had been Surveyor for Streatliam for nearly 35 years, resigned their appointments on account of advancing age. The Board in accepting the resignations expressed their high opinion of the services which had been rendered by these officers, and an allowance in conformity with the Superannuation Act was granted in each case. Mr. Dobson, who had been in failing health for some time, died within a few weeks after bis retirement. Mr. P. Dodd, formerly of Southend, was appointed Surveyor for Wandsworth in succession to Mr. Dobson, and Mr. II. J. Marten, formerly of Bradford, was appointed Surveyor for Streatham in succession to Mr. Barber. Mr. II. C. Wood, who had been Surveyor for Tooting since the Board decided in March, 1889, to have a separate staff of officers for that parish, resigned his appointment on account of ill-health at Christmas, 1892. The Board have now decided to amalgamate the Local Committees of Streatham and Tooting, and to have only one Surveyor for the two Parishes. 25 ORDERS OF APPORTIONMENT.

F 71 To the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District. Gentlemen, " We have the honour to present our Annual Report on the health, sanitary condition, and vital statistics of the Wandsworth District for the year 1892. We have adhered to the plan followed in former Reports as to the general arrangement. The Report shows that a very large amount of sanitary work has been performed during the year, and the field of action of the Sanitary Authority is widened almost annually by fresh legislation. During 1892 serious epidemics of scarlet fever and influenza existed, but excepting for these conditions, the general healthiness of the District has been well maintained. We have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, The Medical Officers of Health for the Wandsworth District. p 2 73 REPORT ON THE HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT, 1892. VITAL STATISTICS. The population estimated in the usual way to the middle of 1892 was 162,245, being an increase of 5,314 on the previous year. Population. The total number registered during the year was 4,256, of which 2,136 were males and 2,120 females. The number of births and the birth.rates in the several sub.districts, are compared in the following Table:— Births. TABLE I. BIRTHS. RATES. Sub.Districts. Males. Females. Total. Birth.rate.

This is the lowest rate recorded in any year. The mean rate for the past 10 years is 29.7. Reference to Table III. will show that the birth.rate has been undergoing a continuous fall, broken only by a slight rise in 1884 and in 1891. The birth.rate in registration London during 1892 was 30.9. The natural increase of the population, or the excess of births ever deaths, was 1,871, and the rate of natural increase was 11.53 per 1,000 living. The total deaths during the year was 2385, of which 1,147 were males and 1,238 females. Of these deaths, however, 211 were of inhabitants from other parts of London who died in the Workhouse, Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, Home for Incurables, St. Anne's Home, Home for the Dying, &c. Deaths. The following Table gives the distribution in the sub. districts :— TABLE II. DEATHS. Sub.Districts. Males. Females. Total. Death-rate.

The rate is nearly the same as in 1891. The following Table shows the rates for the last 10 years:— Birth-rates, Death-rates, and rates of Natural Increase in the entire district during the ten years 1882—91 inclusive. Years.

The deaths already enumerated do not include those of inhabitants of this district who have died in various hospitals and institutions outside its borders. Deaths in Outlying Institutions. 76 In the following Table the deaths properly belonging to the district occurring in outlying institutions have been arranged according to the character of the institution in which they occurred and the sub-districts to which they belong.

This figure is compared with that of the last 4 years in the following Table, which also gives the rates for the sub-districts:— Zymotic Diseases. TABLE VIII. 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 Clapham 1.9 1.4 1.5 2.19 2.41 Putney 1.0 .73 1.1 1.23 1.97 Streatham 1.7 .8 1.8 2.21 2.35 Tooting 2.4 1.7 2.43 2.46 Wandsworth 3.7 1.3 3.3 2.07 3.80 Whole District 2.1 1.1 2.1 2.06 2.76 The zymotic death.rate has therefore undergone a rise since the previous year. If to these we add the 63 deaths from zymotic diseases in outlying institutions (see Table IV.) the total becomes 513, and the death.rate 3.1. In the Table, however, are included 112 deaths from influenza, nearly double as many as in last year. Before 1890 no deaths were referred to this cause. If we omit these influenza deaths for the sake of comparison with former years the death-rate becomes 11, a very low figure which, considering the extensive prevalence of scarlet fever during the year, is very satisfactory. Taking now the deaths from each disease, Small-pox was not the cause of a single death, nor was any case notified during the year. There has been no death registered from this cause in the district since the 82 year 1885. During last summer, however, this disease showed evidence of spreading in London, a total of 29 deaths being recorded in the year. Scarlet Fever.—Twenty.nine deaths were due to scarlet fever—10 at their homes and 19 in the fever hospitals. In the preceding year there were 7 deaths from this cause. Like the rest of London this district suffered from a somewhat considerable prevalence of scarlet fever during the spring and autumn months. It is, of course, not possible to say whether the epidemic was more extensive than in previous epidemic years, because before 1890 there was no notification of infective diseases. The mean average of deaths for the last 7 years, however, is 15 when corrected for increase of population, but in 1888, when the disease was epidemic, there were 31 deaths caused by it. During last year there were 887 cases reported to us, so that the case mortality was 3.2 per cent. The Asylums Board were unable to accommodate all the patients who sought admission, and during 3 weeks—at the end of September and in October—cases could not be removed without a a delay of several days, and in a few instances as much as a week. This we found to have a serious effect, in instances where isolation could not be carried out in the houses of the patients, in causing other cases to occur. It is noticeable that year by year a larger proportion of the sufferers from infectious disease are removed to hospitals, a tendency which we welcome from the public health point of view; but it is evident that very largely increased accommodation will have to be provided by the Asylums Board, if this tendency persists, as it probably will. In this district 446 cases of scarlet fever were removed to hospital, a proportion of 50.3 per cent, of the total number of cases that occurred. Diphtheria.—The deaths from this cause were 57, of which 36 occurred at their homes and 21 in the hospitals. 83 The numbers in the years 1887.88.69.90 and '91 (including those in outlying institutions) were respectively 21, 66, 42, 20, and 30. There has been an increase therefore in the number on those of the last 3 years, but there are fewer deaths than in 1888. The rise in the number of deaths from this cause was common to the whole of London last year, there being 712 more than the corrected decennial average. This is associated, it must be remembered, with steady and great improvement in sanitary conditions generally, so that we are almost driven to the conclusion that the spread of it is principally due to direct infection. It is certainly the case that at present it is not popularly regarded as being in at all the same category, as regards infectiveness, with scarlet fever, and probably isolation is not insisted on sufficiently long in many instances. We are often requested to disinfect houses a few days after the case has been notified, but it by no means follows that infectiousness has ceased the moment the throat has apparently cleared up. The number of cases reported was 242, and the mortality was 23 5 per cent., so that nearly 1 died out of every 4 cases. The removals to hospital were 88, or 36.3 per cent, of the whole. The mortality of the hospital cases was 23.8, and of those that remained at home 23.3 per cent. If we assume, as is certainly the case, that the cases removed to hospital were more severe on the average, this result is interesting as showing that removal to hospital on the whole increases the chances of recovery. Membranous Croup.—There were 17 eases notified and 9 deaths. These were most probably diphtheria, and the mortality was extremely high. Enteric or Typhoid Fever.—The deaths numbered 12, as against 10 last year and 17 in the year before. The number of cases was 80, and the mortality 13.9 per cent. That the number of these deaths tends to diminish is very 84 satisfactory, as this disease we know to be associated with sanitary defects. There were also 2 deaths from continued fever. Puerperal Fever.—Seven deaths were ascribed to this cause, as compared with 6 in 1891. There were 13 cases reported, a mortality of over 50 per cent. Erysipelas.—The deaths were 16. The cases reported were 274. Measles.—The deaths were 78 from this illness, about the average number. For our opinions respecting tho responsibility of sanitary authorities as to whooping cough and measles, we refer to our report for 1891. Many, if not most of these deaths, are in our opinions preventible. Whooping Cough caused 89 deaths, also about the average number. Influenza.—No less than 112 deaths were ascribed to influenza, and they principally occurred in the early part of the year, but persisted to a less extent throughout the 12 months. These deaths were nearly all directly due to respiratory diseases certified as being secondary to influenza, and therefore included here. A larger proportion of the deaths that really were due to influenza is probably included under this heading than was the case during the 2 preceding years, because the deaths referred to respiratory diseases were less than in the 2 other epidemic years. The number of deaths from lung disease, viz., 453, exceeds by 70 the average number for the 3 years immediately preceding the commencement of influenza, corrected for increase of population, so that it is probable that, even in 1892, there have been more deaths really due to influenza than were ascribed to it. It will be seen by referring to the local reports for the sub-districts that influenza did not affect them all with equal severity. 85 Diarrhœa caused 82 deaths, as compared with 51 in 1891, but scarcely exceeded the average. Appended is a Table showing the number of each class of infectious disease notified in each sub-district:— TABLE IX. Clapham. Putney. Streatham, Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

This is a fall on the 2 preceding years, but is above the average. Tubercular diseases caused 256 deaths, of which 176 were due to consumption. The number was 30 below the corrected average however. Nervous diseases caused 302 deaths, or 33 below the corrected average, while circulatory diseases, causing 185 deaths exceeded the average by 9. 86 The deaths from cancer and other tumours numbered 101, nearly the same as in 1891, and exceeded the average by 9. Deaths from diseases of the digestive organs were less, but those from diseases of the urinary organs showed a somewhat marked rise numbering 79. The deaths under the heading of premature birth, congenital defects, and lowered vitality very slightly exceeded the average, and those from violence were excessive to the amount of 3. Inquests. The next Table gives particulars of the number of inquests held with the verdicts found. There were 137 such enquiries held during the year. In 71 the verdicts were deaths from natural causes, in 17 the causes of death were accidental, 12 were cases of suicide, 5 come under the head of homicide, and in 2 open verdicts were returned. 87 TABLE X.

In consequence of this considerable alarm was felt lest it should be imported into this country, and should become epidemic. These fears, however, proved to be groundless, for though a number of cases were so imported, no single case occurred except the imported ones. Cholera. 91 On August 25th a circular was issued by the Local Government Board to the Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities, in which it was pointed out that owing to the existing epidemic of scarlet fever the Metropolitan Asylums Board would not be able to provide accommodation in their hospitals for many cholera cases. The circular went on to say :— "The Board do not propose at the present moment to issuo regulations under the powers which are conferred upon thorn by Section 134 of the Public Health Act, 1875; and which are referred to in Section 82 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In the event, however, of its becoming necessary for the Board to issue such regulations, they would impose on tho Sanitary Authorities the duty of making arrangements for the prevention and treatment of cholera, and among those arrangements would be comprised the visitation of poorer houses for the purpose of detecting cholera and diarrhoea, and the supply of medical attendance and nursing, and of medicine and disinfectants. The arrangements to be made by Sanitary Authorities would further include the provision of such additional hospitals and places of refuge as might be necessary for the several parishes and districts, the hospitals being provided for the reception of those cholera patients who could not properly be treated in their own homes, and the places of refuge for the lodgement of those persons not actually sick whom it might be right to keep under observation or to accommodate while their homo was either under disinfection or was devoted to a sick person who could not properly be removed. "The Board desire that it should be clearly understood that, although the Managers (of the Asylums Board) may make a limited provision of hospital accommodation, it would devolve under the regulations upon each Sanitary Authority to provido such hospital accommodation as would, in the event of cholera becoming epidemic in their parish or district, be requisite for tho reception of cases where removal to hospital is required, the arrangements as regards the Managers affording to the Sanitary Authorities time and facility for supplying their own particular requirements as to hospital provision. 92 "It would not be proposed that the Managers should be charged with any duty of providing places of refuge, such as those above referred to, for persons not actually sick. This provision, which experience has shown to be of as much importance as the removal of the sick to hospital for preventing the spread of cholera, would be an undivided function of the Sauitary Authority. "It is to be observed that the amount expended by any local authority in the Metropolis in providing any building for use as a hospital or as a place of refuge under regulations issued by the Board will, to such extent as may bo determined by the Board, together with two-thirds of the salaries or remuneration of any officers or servants employed in any such building, be repaid to them from tho Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and will consequently be a charge on the whole Metropolis." Before arrangements could be made for all these purposes the danger came to an end for tho year, and the regulations were not issued by the Local Government Board. Since then, however, the matter has been receiving anxious attention by the Sanitary Committee in view of a possible outbreak this year, and probably arrangements in regard to all the points mentioned above will be made before there is any outbreak, should it unfortunately occur in 1893. Great changes were made in sanitary work by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which came into operation January 1st, 1892. Sanitary Proceedings. The provisions as to smoke consumption have now to be carried out by the Sanitary Authority. Though in some instances notices were served on occupiers of factories to prevent black smoke escaping from their chimneys, no case sufficiently aggravated to require legal proceedings being taken was discovered. Smoke Consumption. The cleanliness, conditions as to overcrowding and sanitary arrangements of workshops are now enforced Workshops. 93 by the Sanitary Authority. Accordingly many inspections of workshops have been made and workshops have been caused to be cleansed and additional sanitary conveniences have been caused to be provided. Under the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878.1891, the Home Secretary made an order dated October 31st, 1892, requiring the occupiers of certain factories and workshops to keep lists of out.workers, to be open to inspection by any officer of a sanitary authority, The factories and workshops referred to are those in which the following processes are carried on ;—The manufacture of articles of wearing apparel, the manufacture of electro.plate, cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work, and the manufacture of files. The Local Government Board thereupon issued a circular to Sanitary Authorities calling their attention to the order, and going on to say :— "The Secretary of State informs the Board that he is anxious that the Sanitary Authorities should give full publicity to tho order in their districts, and follow it up by active steps for the inspection of the workshops and houses in which the out.workers are employed, in order that full effect may be given to the object which Parliament had in view when passing the enactment under which the order is issued. "The Board trust that the Sanitary Authority will co.operate in this matter to the utmost of its power. They should at onco take measures to secure that tho order is made known to those whom it affects, and the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspector should be instructed from time to time to examine the lists, so that they may become aware of the places in which out-workers in the trades in question are employed. "It is especially desirable that frequent inspection should bo made of these places, so that prompt measures may be taken to deal with any sanitary evils existing in them." Accordingly copies of the order were served on all factories and workshops in this district, coming under it, 94 where out-workers were known to be employed. It is obvious, however, that if any good is to result an immense amount of work will bo entailed. In the first place it would be necessary to inspect the lists of outworkers at frequent intervals, as the employes are many of them not permanent hands, but change from time to time. Then the difficulty arises that out-workers do not by any means always live and work in the same sanitary district where they are employed, so that there would be many out-workers bringing their work home into this district, who are employed by the oocupants of workshops in other parts of London, where, only, the names and addresses can be seen. So that there is a necessity either for the co-operation of the Sanitary Authorities who would agree to forward to the Authorities concerned the names and addresses of out.workers, or that the Home Office should, by means of the Inspectors under the Factory and Workshops Acts, examine the lists and distribute the addresses to the proper Sanitary Authorities. An alteration of the law compelling the occupiers of the factories and workshops to send the lists to Sanitary Authorities would, also, be a great help. The matter was under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee at the close of the year. Much consideration was given by the Sanitary Committee in framing the bye.laws that have to be made by Sanitary Authorities under the Public Health Act, Sections 16, 29, 50, and 94. On the foundation of model bye.laws drawn up by the Local Government Board, bye.laws were made on the following subjects:— "(i.) For the prevention of nuisances arising from any snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or any matter or thing in any street. Bye-laws. 95 "(ii.) For tho preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or dung-hill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence. "(iii.) For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises so as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. "(iv.) As to the paving of yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling-houses. "(v.) With respect to the keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. "(vi.) For securing the cleanliness and freedom from polution of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles used for storing of water used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man. These bye-laws are still under the consideration of the Local Government Board by whom they have to be confirmed. Tho drafting of bye-laws under Section 94—for fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the registration, inspection, cleansing, &c., of such houses—was deferred pending the receipt of the model bye-laws promised by the Local Government Board. Table XIII. gives in the usual form the summary of sanitary operations in each sub-district. From it will be seen that an unusual amount of work of all kind has been carried out. This must be partly attributed to the notification of infectious diseases, any outbreak of which is followed by the careful inspection of premises and drains with the result of bringing to light many nuisances.

In view of the importance of the question of the water supply of London, the following statements and tables extracted from the annual report of Professor E. Frankland are interesting. The district is supplied by the Southwark and Yauxhall and the Lambeth Water Companies which draw their water from the Thames at Hampton and Molesey. As regards filtration, Professor Frankland says:—"The samples of water collected and examined by me were invariably clear and bright. Even when analysis showed the admission of flood water, the water actually supplied to consumers was always efficiently filtered, and, during the entire year, there was no such exceptional pollution as that which occurred sometimes in the previous twelve months." As to the chemical examination of the water, "The comparatively small proportion of organic material which the solid matter invariably contains is of great importance in connection with the use of the water for drinking purposes. For, although the actual amount of organic matter is often quite insignificant, yet it may be of the most objectionable character on account of its origin. Thus the water of the Thames receives, above the point where it is abstracted for the purpose of the metropolitan supply, various contributions of organic matter of animal origin, such as the drainage of manured lands, the eflluent from sewage works, and even raw sewage itself. This animal matter may, at any time, be accompanied by zymotic poisons dangerous to health, and although the chances of such matter reaching the water consumer are enormously reduced, both by the care which is exercised in excluding the flood waters from the reservoirs, and especially by the efficient filtration to which 98 the water is subjected before distribution; yet, in spite of these protective measures, there is no absolute guarantee that these noxious ingredients, which may at any time be present are wholly removed. From his observations on the numbers of microbe colonics developed in samples of the Thames water and the filtered product, he draws these among other conclusions:— That bacterially as well as chemically, filtration or percolation is immensely more efficient for the purification of water than mere flow for scores of miles in a river. "That it is possible, by careful filtration, so to arrest microbes and their spores, as to transform Thames water into a beverage which, bacterially, is but little inferior to that from deep wells in the chalk." The subjoined Table shows the average result of the 12 monthly analyses of water from the Thames at the intakes and as delivered by the two companies, and the last column gives the number of microbe colonies in each cubic centimetre of the raw water and the water as it leaves the filter beds:— 90 Averages of the Monthly Analyses of Water in 1892.

Population. The population in the middle of 1892, estimated in the usual way, is 44,711; it being assumed that the same rate of increase is going on as obtained in the 10 years between the last two censuses. Birth and Birth-rate The number of births registered during the year was 1,043, of which 523 were males, and 520 females. This is a less number than in 1891, and only twice in the last 10 years has a smaller number been registered. The birth-rate was 23.3 per thousand, a lower rate than in any of the last 10 years excepting 1890. The rate of natural increase, calculated from the excess of births over deaths, was 9.64 per thousand, again an unusually low figure. It is interesting that the birth-rate for registration London was the lowest recorded excepting, as in Clapham, that of the year 1890; and the rate of natural increase is also considerably below the average. Death and Death-rate The number of deaths registered was 611, of which 288 were of males, and 323 of females. This number is in excess of that registered in any year, and gives a rate of 13.66, practically the same as in 1891. Twenty of the deaths, however, were of non-parishioners, and occurred in the British Home for Incurables and the Home for the Dying in The Chase, leaving 591 as the number of deaths of Clapham inhabitants, and giving a corrected rate of 13.22 per thousand living. 103 Table I. gives a comparison of these rates with those of the last ten years:— TABLE I.

The following Table gives particulars of deaths that properly belong to this Sub-district, and which have occurred in various Institutions outside its borders, such as the hospitals and asylums. There were 106 of these deaths, of which 48 took place in the Union Infirmary, 41 in the general and special hospitals, and 17 in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Adding these 106 deaths to those above mentioned, we get a total of 697, giving the correct rate of 15.58. The corresponding rate of 1891 was 15.8. The rate for registration London in 1892 was 20.6:—- TABLE III. Deaths in Outlying District. DISEASES. Sex. Age. Institutions. Tota . Males. Females. Under 1. 1 to 60. 60 and upwards.

Totals 106 59 37 6 65 35 48 41 17 108 Ages at Death. From Table II. we see that the proportion of the deaths at different age groups to the total deaths was as follows:— Under 5 years 36.7 per cent. Prom 5 to 65 years 38.8 ,, Over 65 years 24.5 „ Infantile Death rate. The number of deaths of infants under 1 year was 143, and the rate per thousand births (that is per thousand of the population living at that age) was 137, compared with 149 and 128 in the 2 preceding years. The rate for London in 1892 was 154. Social Position. The proportion in the various social grades was as follows:— Nobility and Gentry 3.6 per cent. Professional Classes 9.5 ,, Middle and Trading Classes 24.0 ,, Industrial and Labouring Classes 62.9 ,, Zymotic Mortality.—The subjoined Table gives the number of deaths for the different Zymotic diseases for the last 10 years, with the Zymotic and general death-rates. The total deaths in this class was 108, 14 in excess of the corrected decennial average. This is more than accounted for, however, by the 27 deaths referred to Influenza, showing that the mortality from the other diseases of this class was below the average. The Zymotic death-rate was 2.41; the corrected decennial average being 2.23. Omitting the deaths referred to Influenza wo have a rate of 1.8, which can be more fairly used to compare with previous years when there was no Influenza. The deaths in Out-lying Institutions, however, should hero be taken into account (see Table III.), so that 26 deaths should be added giving a total of 184, and a deathrate of 2.99. 109 TABLE IV.

Small Pox.—Again it is satisfactory to report that not only no deaths occurred from this disease, but no case occurred. There were evidences of a tendency for Small Pox to become prevalent in London during the early summer, but though some sanitary districts experienced a considerable outbreak, any general diffusion was prevented by the vigorous measures adopted to restrain it. While, however, there exists an increasing part of the population unvaccinated, and while the protective influence of revaccination is so seldom taken advantage of there will 110 always be groat danger of the very expensive machinery kept up in London failing to prevent a serious epidomic of Small Pox. Influenza.—The deaths referred to this cause were 31 (including the four in Table III.) The disease was epidemic in January and February, and to a less extent in March. It must be remembered that none of these deaths were caused directly by Influenza, but were due to some complication, generally a lung disease. Whenever mention is made of a Zymotic disease in a certificate of the cause of death, whether as the primary or secondary cause, the death is put under that heading. The probability that Influenza was not so prevalent as in the two previous years is shown by the fall in the number of deaths from respiratory disease (see Table VI. below), which were 13 below the decennial average. Scarlet Fever.—During the year a somewhat widespread epidemic of Scarlet Fever was experienced, as usual reaching a maximum in the autumn mouths. It caused 15 deaths, all but two of which occurred in the fever hospitals. Altogether 320 cases were notified, so that the percentage of deaths was 4.7. Of these 180 were removed to hospital, and 140 were treated at home. The percentage of deaths in those removed was 7.2, and in those ' treated at home 1.4, a difference to be explained, probably, by the more severe cases having been removed, and especially that they were mostly from poorer and more insanitary parts of the parish, and were able to offer less resistance to the disease. Out of the 15 deaths 12 were of children under five years of age. During the height of the epidemic the accommodation at the disposal of the Asylums Board was all used, and patients could not be removed without in many cases a delay of upwards of a week, a condition of affairs which I think contributed to its further spread. 1ll Diphtheria caused 14 deaths, 5 in the hospitals, and 9 at home, as compared with 2 last year. In the preceding three years the deaths were 23, 3 and 6. The number of cases notified was 56, so that the case mortality was 25 per cent., showing what a fatal and dangerous disease this is. The number removed to hospital was 24, so that the case mortality there was 20.8, and in the 32 who were treated at home it was 28.1 per cent. This would seem to show that hospital treatment is of advantage in Diphtheria. Membranous Croup was responsible for 2 deaths, out of a total of 4 cases notified. These were probably cases of Diphtheria. As regards causation of these cases the drains in the houses where they occurred were carefully tested, and in 24 of these, serious defects, such as very possibly caused the attacks, were found and remedied. Enteric Fever.—To this cause were attributed 7 deaths, of which 1 occurred in hospital and 6 at home. The number of cases reported was 22. Last year the number of eases reported was 20, and the deaths were 4. There were also 3 cases of continued fever reported, with 1 death. Especial care was given to examining the drains in the houses where these cases occurred, and all the defects found were remedied. Puerperal Fever.—The number notified was 5, and there was one death. Besides disinfection in these cases, the midwives who were attending the patients were prevented from attending other women for 6 weeks. Erysipelas. —Three deaths were referred to this disease, and 79 cases notified, the majority of which were apparently of a trivial character. Measles caused 21 deaths, a number less than the 112 average one, but still high. All but 1 were of children under 5 years of age. It has not been possible to take any effective measures to prevent this loss of child life. Usually the first information that is received of the occurrence of measles is from the certificate of death, though occasionally the teachers in the Board Schools have brought cases to our knowledge, and enabled us to exclude other children in the infected houses from school. Whooping Cough.—The number of deaths was 26, a larger number than in any of the last three years. Absolutely no precautions are taken as a rule by parents of children suffering from whooping cough. They are taken without the least hesitation to dispensaries and the out-patient departments of hospitals by train and omnibus, and only surprise is expressed if you blame them for it. It is no wonder that practically all children suffer from it in the early years of life. All the 26 deaths were of children under 5 years of age. Diarrhoea caused 12 deaths, the same number as last year, and considerably below the decennial average. TABLE V.

In London there was a decrease in the number of deaths from, tubercular diseases. Diseases of the nervous system and respiratory diseases both show a marked fall, and the number referred to tumours is also slightly less. The deaths from circulatory diseases—62 in number—have increased by 8. The deaths from premature birth and low vitality have exceeded the average by 2, and those from violence by 11. 114 Inquests. There have been 40 inquests held during the year, the following being the verdicts:— Males. Females. 1. From Natural Causes 7 10 17 2. Accidental ., Suffocation in bed -with Mother 1 3 Falls 2 2 Scalds and Burns 1 3 Fractures 1 1 Run over by Train 1 15 3. Suicido Poisoning by Carbolic Acid 1 Poisioning by Pkosphrous 1 Drowning 1 4. Wilful Murder 3 3 5. Open Verdicts Found Dead 1 Found Drowned1 2 40 The 3 verdicts of wilful murder related to the bodies of 3 newly born children found in different parts of the parish. The number of deaths uncertified by a medical man, on which no inquests were held, was only 5, a lower number than any recorded. Vaccination.—The table on page 90 of the general report gives information as to the amount of vaccination carried out. From it it is seen that 100 children, by removal or other causes, escaped being vaccinated. Disinfection —By the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which came into force January 1st, 1892, increased cost for disinfection has been thrown on the Board who are responsible for all the cost of disinfection after 115 infectious disease. Four hundred and forty-six rooms in 351 houses were fumigated with sulphurous acid gas by this department, and 8 by the occupants as certified by the medical man in attendance. Two public cabs also were disinfected after being used to remove infected persons. Two hundred and ninety-two lots of bedding, clothing, &c., have been disinfected by superheated steam, and 6 lots of bedding have been burnt. Two hundred and sixty-five notices were served to strip paper and cleanse rooms after fumigation, and in some instances the work had to be done by servants of the Board. Sanitation.—A great increase of work has been thrown on the staff by the Public Health (London) Act, and in some of the new directions the work has not been completely overtaken. Underground rooms are now under the jurisdiction of the Board, when occupied separately from any room above ground. The number thus occupied is not great, though a great many are used for sleeping and living in, which escape regulation by reason of a single room above ground being used by the same people. It is obviously just as important that the basement rooms should be well ventilated and healthy, if used for sleeping in, when let along with one or more rooms above ground. I think that an amendment of the law to apply the statutory regulations to them also would be of great value. Another difficulty found in dealing with underground rooms is that at the time of inspection there may be no separate occupation of them, whereas in the following week the conditions of tenancy may have changed, as frequently happens, and the rooms become separately occupied. Workshops.—The sanitary condition of all workshops has now to be controlled by the officers of the Board, also overcrowding and the rendering harmless to the workers 116 of any noxious products of manufactures carried on in tliern. Accordingly a large number of workshops have been inspected; 10 were ordered to be cleansed, and in 5 there was insufficient water-closet accommodation, and more was caused to be provided. No case of overcrowding was found, and no case where means of ventilation were so bad as to necessitate interference, excepting that of a new laundry where the ventilation had to be improved. The following statistics show what a large amount of general sanitary work has been carried out:— During the year 4,215 houses and premises have been inspected, and the total number of nuisances dealt with amounted to 7,979, of these 7,425 were abated under notice, and 554 under promises. The Table on page 96 gives a statement of nuisances dealt with that can be conveniently classified. The number of unclassified nuisances was 1,214, viz.: — 608 water-closets disconnected from drinking water cisterns and a separate supply laid on, 201 soil-pipes ventilated, 95 soil-pipes renewed or repaired, 25 defective ventilating pipes repaired, 47 floors repaired, 15 walls repaired, 4 windows repaired, 16 cases of water in basements, 12 cases of stagnant water, 7 basement floors raised, 55 leaky sinks, 48 leaky water fittings, 7 cellar dwellings, 9 areas lowered below floor level, 11 dirty bakehouses, 2 privies abolished, 9 manure receptacles provided, 2 lots of foul bedding burnt, 2 smoke nuisances, 8 cases of rats, water running over footway, leaky gas fittings, carpet beating, organisms in water from company's main, store-room uaventilated. Animals kept so as to be a nuisance, viz.:—Dogs, 2 cases; goats, 2; rabbits, 6; pigeons, 2; fowls, 2; ducks, 2; donkeys, 2; cats, horse, and pig. 117 The drains of 233 houses and premises have been reconstructed in accordance with the Board's regulations for new drainage 291 man-holes have been constructed, and 455 new ventilating pipes fixed. One trunk of fish was destroyed, it having become unfit for food. Police Court Proceeding, Thirty-seven summonses were taken out at the Police Court to enforce the orders of the Board in connection with sanitary defects. Twenty-two summonses were withdrawn, the necessary work having been carried out, and in 15 cases magistrates orders were made and fines inflicted to the amount of £24 and costs. Housing of the Working Classes Acr,1890. In 50 instances premises were found to be in so bad a state that I certified them under Part II. of this Act, and notices were served to render them fit for habitation. They resulted as follows:— Nos. 1, 2, 4, North View, Upper Orchard \ Street Cleansed, 1, 2, 3, 9, West Place repaired, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, Smith's Cottages and damp 29, 19, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, South View stopped out. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, Upper Orchard Street 24, 22, 20, 18, 12, 10, G, 5, Lyles' Cottages, The necesLower Orchard Street sary works 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Clark's Cottages are in pro- 3, 8, 9. 12, 12a, Lower Orchard Street gress. Summonses were issued in all the foregoing cases, but were withdrawn as the property changed hands, and the new owner undertook to do what wa3 necessary. i 118 Nos. 204, 208, 210, 214 Lyham Road.—Thoroughly cleansed and repaired, and drainage renewed. No. 3, Bromell's Passage.—Closed by the Magistrate's order. The cow-houses and slaughter-houses were inspected in September. The bake-houses were inspected twice during the year. Lime-whiting was required in 3 instances in May, and in 8 instances in October. I have pleasure in again testifying to the excellence of the work done by the inspectors, who have all proved themselves careful and reliable. OLIVER FIELD, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Clapham. 119 PUTNEY & ROEHAMPTON. I estimate the population of Putney and Roehampton for the year 1892 at 18,22G. This estimate cannot be far from the correct population, as the census enumeration was taken so recently. Birth and Deaths. During the year 417 births were registered, of which 214 were males and 233 females. This is equal to a birth-rate of 24-5 per 1,000 per annum. Two hundred and forty-seven deaths from all causes were registered, which gives a death-rate of 13'5 per 1,000 per annum. This is a higher death-rate than we have had for the last seven years.

There were 34 more deaths registered during the year than during 1891. This increase appears to me to be very largely accounted for by the influenza epidemic which prevailed during the first three months of the year, and the results which followed it. Respiratory diseases are 121 responsible to the greatest extent for the increased mortality, and in many cases doubtless they were among the sequelae of the epidemic. The mortality of different ages may be represented as follows:— Under 1 year 29.5 per cent, of total mortality. 1 and under 5 years 117 „ „ „ 5 „ 15 1.2„ „ „ 15 ,, 25 „ 1.2 ,, ,, ,, 25 „ 65 „ 29.8 „ 65 and upwards 26.6 ,, „ „ In the whole of London the deaths of infants under 1 year was equal to 23.2 per cent, of the total mortality. It gives a more accurate idea, however, of the mortality among infants to express it in relation to the number of births during the year. In a district where the birth-rate is high, the same percentage of infantile deaths in relation to the general mortality, does not have the same significance at in a district with a much lower birth-rate. During the year it is found that in this sub-district for every 1,000 births there were 163 deaths of infants under a year. That is to say, one child died during the first year of life for every six born. This is below the average of the large towns of England, but above that of London where the average is 155. We appear to have in this sub-district a permanently high mortality among infants. Why that should be it is difficult to explain. A large proportion of these deaths is due to improper feeding and neglect. 122 TABLE III. STATISTICS OF MORTALITY. PUTNEY. Total Deaths from each Class of Disease. &c., in the Sub-District. Sex. Age.

Professional classes 13.3 „ Middle and trading classes 29.9 ,, Industrial and labouring classes 56.8 „ Tubercular Diseases were the cause of 23 deaths during the year, which is equivalent to 9.4 per cent. of the total mortality, or 1.2 per 1,000 per annum of the population living. Respiratory Diseases were the cause of 55 deaths. This number is considerably higher than the usual proportion of deaths from this cause. No doubt many of these cases were complications or sequelae of Influenza. The deaths from respiratory diseases were equal to 3 per 1,000 per annum of the population living. Nine deaths were registered as the result of Cancer. It is a noteworthy fact that the mortality attending this disease tends to rise year after year. Zymotic Diseases.—In Table IV. the number of deaths arising from Zymotic Diseases is tabulated, and a comparison made with those occuring during the previous nine years. Thirty-six deaths occurred from these diseases, which gives us a Zymotic death-rate of 19 per 1,000 per annum. 126 TABLE IV. Zymotic Mortality in Putney and Rochampton Sub-district.

A good many others were doubtless caused by it indirectly. This peculiar disorder has been epidemic with us for the last three years. Daring that time it has never been quite extinct, and the three annual epidemics of the last three years could more properly be called three annual exacerbations of the one epidemic. There has been no fortnight during the last three years, in which deaths have not occurred in London from this disease. In my experience, however, the type of the disease in 1892 was of a milder character than during the two former years. 127 No deaths have resulted from small pox, measles, scarlet fever or diphtheria. This is most satisfactory as these are the diseases with the exception of measles, which are most directly under sanitary control. Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea were as usual the two most fatal zymotic diseases among children. The first of these is communicated directly from one child to another and practically the sanitary authority is powerless to do much to prevent it. Diarrhœa was prevalent almost exclusively during the summer months. Most cases are due to want of sufficient care in the feeding of children. Fermentation of milk very rapidly occurs in hot weather with the development of toxic products. These set up intestinal irritation after being taken into the system. The best and most simple method of preventing this is by boiling the milk immediately after delivery. Enteric Fever. —There was one fatal case of this disease during the year. There is every reason to believe that the victim caught the infection outside the district. Notifications. Small Pox.—No cases occurred during the year. Scarlatina.—No deaths were registered from this cause. Fifty cases were notified and of these 28 were removed to hospital. Seven of these cases occurred among children under five years of age and 21 over that age. Diphtheria.—Seventeen cases were notified with no fatal results. In at least three of these cases, I was able to distinctly trace the cause to defective drains. These three cases occurred in one house aud were not the result of direct infection communicated from one to the other. They did not occur simultaneously, but the second was struck down after the first had recovered. It was found 128 there was free leakage of sewage gas into the larder where the food supplies were stored. It is a well known fact that milk especially has a great power of absorption of gas and no doubt in these cases it was one of the vehicles by which the poison was conveyed to the system. Since the drains have been properly relaid there has been no re-appearance of the disease. In eleven of the houses where diphtheria broke out sanitary defects were found in connection with the drainage. Typhoid Fever.—Twelve cases were notified, two case under five years of age and the rest over that age. Eight of these cases were removed to hospital. inquests. Sixteen inquests were held during the year and the verdicts are classified as follows:— I. Natural From Natural Causes 7—7 II. Accidental. Drowning 2 Run over by Train 1 Syncope 1—4 III. Homicidal Uterine injury. 1—1 IV. Suicidal Drowning 2 Shooting 1 Cut Throat 1— 4 16 Sanitary Proceedings during the Year. The summary of sanitary operations during the year given in Table XIII. in the introductory portion of our report, shows that a great amount of most useful work has been again carried out. Three thousand four hundred and thirth-nine houses and premises were inspected. This does not quite come up to the number inspected during the year 1891. On the other hand there has been a mnch greater number of new drains put down 129 and old drains re-laid. Two hundred and twenty-five of such drains were laid compared with 80 last year. This new drain inspection work is, I consider, one of the most important sanitary operations carried on by the Board. Each new drain now laid is thoroughly inspected and tested with the water test before being passed by the inspector. This work takes up a great deal of time. The importance and necessity of it, however, cannot be over estimated when one considers the way in which house drains were formerly laid down. Six hundred and nintyseven notices were served to remedy defects, but in only 74 cases, statutory notices were served. Sulphur fumigation and disinfection was carried out in 58 premises and in no cases did the disease recur after this was carried out. Factory and Workshop Acts, 1878 and 1891.—The order issued by the Secretary of State under these Acts makes it obligatory on the sanitary authority to ascertain all these out-workers employed in this district. The order did not come into practical operation during the year 1892. To carry it out efficiently a great amount of additional work will be thrown on the staff, periodical inspections will require to be made of the houses of these out-workers. Of course many of them will live in districts outside our sanitary area. Lists of such outworkers must therefore be sent to the sanitary authority of the districts where they reside. The value of this order will be very great especially as a means of preventing the spread of infectious disease. With tailors' work more especially, it is admitted that infectious disease is not infrequently communicated. By the compulsory notification of disease, assisted by this order, it will be possible to put an end to this source of danger in future 130 The sanitary condition of all workshops has now been placed under the sanitary authority instead of under the factory inspector under the old Acts. To carry out this section of the Act a regular inspection has been made of 81 workshops in this sub-district. In 22 cases it was found necessary to serve notices to abate nuisances. The Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.— under this statute twelve notices were served to make the premises fit for human habitation. These notices referred to certain houses in Isabella Place. The defects were general structural defects—improperly paved and dirty back yards in which sheds and other erections were placed obstructing the free entrance of light and air to the houses. The necessary works are now in progress. Under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, I was called upon to inspect certain premises situated in the Lower Richmond Road. These houses were built on the flat system, each flat accommodating a separate family and let separately. I found the sanitary arrangement and conveniences satisfactory and was therefore able to give a certificate of exemption from the Inhabited House Duty. The usual inspections of all bakehouses in the parish have been made. They have been found in a satisfactory condition with the exception of two cases, in which notices were served and the necessary works done. I have also personally inspected all cow sheds and slaughter houses and did not think it necessary to object to the renewal of their licenses. 131 In the month of October a special inspection was made to ascertain the sanitary condition of all the schools in the parish. As a result of this inspection a special report was made at the request of the Putney Committee. There was found to he insufficient school accomodation for the number of children attending the Charlwood Road National Schools. Serious defects were pointed out in connection with the sanitary arrangement of the school. The School Committee showed every desire to remedy the defects pointed out. After an interview between Mr. Lee, the Surveyor, and myself, the works were put in hand and have since been completed. Plans have been made for building an additional school beside Putney Lower Common which, when erected, will doubtless provide ample school accommodation. In conclusion I have to thank all those associated with myself in carrying out the sanitary work of this sub-district and also the members of the Putney Local Committee for the support and assistance I have at all times received from them.

The Census population of this parish in the year 1891 was 42,958, revealing the fact that the mean annual increase was 2,042, and upon this calculation is based the population for the year 1892, as 45,000. The following statistics which as usual are derived from the Registrar General's Returns and the local records of sickness and mortality are based upon this estimate of population. Birth and Birth Rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1,067, 558 of males and 509 of females. The birth-rate calculated from the total number of births and the foregoing estimate of population, was 23.7 per 1,000 persons living during the year; this rate is much below the decennial average. Natural Increase. The excess of births over deaths was 509 giving a rate of 11.3 per 1000 of the population. Deaths and Death Rate. During the year 1892, 558 deaths were registered in the parish of which 280 were of males and 278 of females, giving a death-rate of 12.4 per 1000. To arrive at the actual number of deaths of parishioners both within and without the district, the total number of deaths in St. Anne's Home [(the deceased 133 being parishioners of St. Pancras) for details refer to Table A,] must be excluded from the calculation, and the deaths in outlying institutions within the Metropolis, set out in Table II. must be included, representing a total of 572, and giving the correct death-rate as 12.7 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate, although apparently higher than that of previous years is accounted for by the hitherto different method of calculation from that already described. The statistics of former years give the death-rates of parishioners (excluding non-parishioners) within the parish, not accounting for those dying in the institutions without the parish. The death-rate for the year upon that method of calculation would be ll.5 per 1000 and will compare very favourably with other years, and with any district either urban or rural. Table I. gives the number of births and deaths, birthrates and death-rates, and rates of natural increase during the past ten years. TABLE I. Birth and Death Rates. YEARS. Births. Birth-rate.

Social Position. The subjoined table gives the proportion of deaths in the several social grades. Nobility and Gentry 47 = 8.4 per cent. Professional Classes 48 = 8.6 „ Middle and Trading Classes 151 = 27.0 „ Industrial and Labouring Classes 312 = 56.0 „ Total deaths 555 100.0 The proportion of deaths was high as compared with last year amongst the Nobility and Gentry, and also the Industrial and Labouring Classes, whilst a marked declination was prevalent amongst both the Professional Classes and the Middle and Trading Classes. Zymotic Diseases, their prevalence and fatality. There were 107 deaths in this class, including 35 from influenza. They yield a percentage of 19.1 upon the deaths from all causes. The seven principal diseases in this class give a deathrate of 1.1 per 1,000 of the population. The following table contrasts all the deaths resulting from the seven principal epidemic diseases with the death-rate therefrom, as well as the death-rates from all diseases during the past ten years. 141 TABLE IV.

There were 35 deaths due primarily to Influenza; the epidemic was at its height during the months of January and February, when 30 (or six-sevenths of the total deaths from the disease during the whole year) occurred. 142 Small pox. There has been no death from Small Pox, nor has there been one during the dccennium, and no case of the Disease has come to our knowledge since the year 1887. Outbreaks of the Disease have occurred, however, three times in the decade, viz., in 1883, in 1884, and again in 1887; in each of these out-breaks, two, three, and four persons living in crowded neighbourhoods were attacked. Hospital Isolation, Vaccination, and Disinfection of infected houses, happily in every instance, prevented the spread of the Disease. Since 1887, there has been complete immunity from Small Pox. This immunity is not, however, likely to continue. We are face to face with an epidemic of the Disease in the Metropolis, which may reach us at any moment. If, as is to be feared, there are many unvaccinated persons in our midst, and also a large proportion of only partially vaccinated, Small Pox will not be so readily arrested. The opposition to vaccination is very strong and general, and in a coming and going population, it is too often evaded altogether, the safeguard being thought worse than the Disease. Of one thing there can be no doubt, that unless Vaccination is compulsory, there will be little protection against the ravages of Small Pox in the future. Measles. Measles was very prevalent in the months of March, April, May and June, when 16 of the total number of deaths occurred. The proportion of deaths to existing cases, and an effectual control of the disease can only be obtained by the adoption of measles as a notifiable disease. Scarlet Fever. In common with the Metropolis, scarlet fever of an epidemic character prevailed during the year. It 143 was fairly equally distributed throughout the district, and of a very mild type, which will at once be perceived from the fact that of the 192 cases notified during the year from this disease," but three proved fatal, two of which were at the homes of the patients and one in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, being per cent. of the total deaths or 1.5 per cent. of the total number of the cases notified. Forty-nine per cent., nearly one-half, of the cases were removed to hospital. Diphtheria. Thirteen deaths occurred from diphtheria, seven at their homes and six in Asylums Board Hospital; although the number of deaths at home was below the decennial average, the total has rather increased compared with late years. Sixty-two cases were notified during the year, of which twenty-nine were removed to hospital. Typhoid Fever. Of the twenty-one cases notified from this disease, three proved fatal, all of which were at their own homes. The drains were all thoroughly examined in these cases, as well as those of diphtheria and scarlet fever, and any sanitary defects remedied. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough accounted for 18 deaths, 10 of which occurred during the months of January, February and March, the time of the year and the atmospheric conditions evidently assisted greatly in the fatal character of the disease, the patients being allowed by their parents to go out and about in most unsuitable weather, consequently contracting various respiratory and other complications. 144 Diarrhœa. Diarrhœa caused fifteen deaths, nine of which occurred during the months of August and September; allowing for increased population this does not exceed the decennial average: Cholera. Although great consternation has prevailed throughout the country as to the possibility of the introduction of Cholera from Hamburg and other infected ports, no cases have yet occurred, but all danger of an invasion is not over, the disease may recur in lately infected districts and very great care will be necessary to prevent infected persons and things from coming amongst us. It behoves us to keep this well in view and to use every means to promote good sanitary conditions. Healthy surroundings and healthy living are the great barriers against cholera and all other infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, great responsibility will rest upon the water companies in regard to filtration; experience shows that cholera follows the course of rivers and largely infects through the water supply. In the presence of an epidemic all water should be boiled as well as filtered. Special precautions have been taken in this sub-district, in regard to sanitation generally and the sanitary authority will, I think, be able to secure sites for temporary hospitals and refuges should occasion require. 145 TABLE V. The following table gives the tolal number of notified diseases, the number of cases removed to Hospital, and the number of deaths that took place, in both the Sub-district and the Hospital.

Many of the causes of death under these headings differ so little from their averages, that comment is unnecessary. The deaths from respiratory diseases, although above the average of past years, were less than last year, and contributed 111 deaths to the total mortality. Respiratory diseases were accountable for one-fifth of the total mortality as compared with one-fourth in the year 1891. There was a slight decrease of deaths from cancer, and a considerable decline in deaths from tubercular diseases compared with past years, although a little in excess of last year. 147 Ages at Death infant Mortality. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age, was 128; under five, 189; and under twenty.five, 229. They respectively formed 22.9, 33.8, and 11 per cent, of all deaths. There was an increase of 2 per cent, in the proportion of deaths of infants under one year, and a decrease of one per cent, of the deaths of children under five years of age. Senile Decay. There were 10 deaths from old age unassociated with disease. Of these, 25 were of males, and 15 of females; they yield a percentage of 7T on all deaths. The total number of deaths at 65 and upwards was 196. Of these, 132 were over 70; 41 were 80 and upwards; the ages of two were 90 and upwards. Below is a statement in tabular form of deaths at high ages, with the age at different periods, and the sex of the deceased. They formed 35.1 per cent, of all deaths. TABLE VII. Age. Males. Females.

The figures relating to the sickness and mortality of the parish poor, are given in Table XII. of the combined Report. In the zymotic class, there were 148 cases of Measles, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Influenza, and Erysipelas; one death arose from both whooping cough and erysipelas. In the other classes, as usual, respiratory diseases contributed a large proportion of the cases under treatment. The heading "Other Diseases," in the Table, includes diseases of the nervous and digestive systems, as well as other local and constitutional disorders, under which, came a very large proportion of the cases treated. The total mortality formed 23 per cent, of cases attended. inquests. Twenty four inquests were held, 12 upon the deaths of males and 12 upon females, with the following verdicts:— I.

A large amount of time and energy have been devoted by the Sanitary Committee and Medical Officers of Health, in the drafting and considerations of Bye.laws under the Public Health (London) Act, 1801, which imposes upon Local Sanitary Authorities, the London County Council, and the Local Government Board, the duty of making such Bye.laws. The Factory and Workshops Act has also imposed additional work on the Sanitary Authority. Particulars of the principal sanitary works of the year arc given in Table XIII. of the combined lteport. The number of house to house inspections was 3,533. Many of these separate inspections, required repeated visits to see if the works required had been duly and satisfactorily carried out, so that the number only partially represents the work of the Sanitary Inspectors, 658 first notices were served to remedv defects and abate nuisances, for which 50 second notices Avere required to be served. A great amount of work has been carried out on requisition without necessitating the service of notices, and does not therefore appear in the Table; 279 rooms in 217 houses were disinfected after infectious diseases. In all instances, the fumigation was carried out by the agency L 150 of sulphur, and in 6G cases super.heated steam in addition. There was no recurrence of the disease in any case, after this treatment. There were 217 syphon traps fixed to drains; 265 water closets were cleansed, repaired, or had water laid on, 2 ccsspools were abolished. 57 dustbins were provided. 3 pig nuisances removed. The Table gives other particulars, and will repay examination, when it will be clearly seen that sanitary a large amount of Sanitary work is being carried out. The bakehouses have been regularly inspected during the year, and the necessary cleansing and lime whiting duly carried out. I personally inspected the cow.sheds and slaughterhouses, and saw no objection to the renewal of the licenses. A very satisfactory state, as regards the public health and sanitary condition of Streatham, it is my pleasure to report. I have to thank the Sanitary Officers for their attention and assistance. They continue to carry out their onerous duties with discretion and ability. P. F. SUTTON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for Stnatham. 151 TOOTING. The estimated population for the year 1892 is 5,276 and upon this are based the following statistics. Births and Birth Rate During the year 164 births were registered, of which 81 were males and 63 females. The birth.rate is 31.0 per 1,000 of the population. Deaths,Death Rate Exclusive of out.lying institutions there and Rate of Natural were 131 deaths recorded in Tooting, 57 of males and 74 of females, giving a death.rate of 24.8 per 1000. The actual total of deaths of parishioners (including deaths of parishioners in out.lying institutions within the Metropolis and excluding those of nonparishioners dying within the district) numbers 155, representing a death.rate of 29.3 per 1,000 of the population. The rate of natural increase was 6.2 per 1,000. Twenty five deaths took place in out.lying institutions, 18 were of males and 7 of females. A tabular statement, giving the ages, causes of death, etc., is included in Table I. One death was attributable to zymotic disease. Of the twenty.five deaths, 10 occurred in the Wandsworth and Clapham Union Infirmary and lifteen in general and special hospitals. l 2 152 TABLE I. Deaths in Outlying Institutions.

During the year 1892 there was much epidemic disease present in this sub.district. Scarlet fever, Diphtheria, and Erysipelas, all of which prevailed extensively throughout the whole Metropolitan area, continued in unabated amount. Measles increased in prevalence and fatality, and Influenza recurred with much greater severity ; the latter disease, both directly as well as by its consequent affections of the breathing organs, contributing very largely to the death.roll. As might be anticipated, therefore, the mortality of the past year was higher than that of its predecessor Notwithstanding these adverse influences, the intensity of the first named disease, although extensively prevalent was very slight, and thus, in a measure, compensated for the severity of the others, so that the death.rate although higher than that of 1891 will be found, on examination of the statistics set forth in the following pages, to have still been greatly below the average. Vital, Statistics. Population. Estimated in accordance with the method of calculation adopted by the Registrar.General, which assumes a continuance of the same rate of increase since the period of the last Census as that which obtained during the ten preceding years, the mean population of this sub.district during the past year amounted to 49,032. l61 The comparatively short space of time that has elapsed since the last Census admits but little probability of that inaccuracy which, in a neighbourhood rapidly increasing by immigration, necessarily occurs after the expiration of several years. Births, Birth.rate, The total number of births registered during Rate of Natural Increase. the year was 1,535 = 760 of males. 775 of females. The number is 62 less than that of the year 1891 and 90 less than the corrected average. This is the first occasion on which fewer deaths have been recorded compared with the preceding decennial average. The birth.rate was 32.55 per 1,000 persons of all ages, and the rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, 17.34 per 1,000. Mortality. The total deaths registered were 838 = 105 of males 133 of females. The average annual number of deaths in the ten years 1882.91 allowing for increase of population was 825, the deaths in the past year therefore exceeded the corrected average by 13. Of the total deaths 131 occurred in the following public institutions, viz.In the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum 86; in the Hospital for Incurables 17; in the Prison 8; and 1 in the Royal Patriotic Asylum for Girls. All the deaths with their causes arc set forth in the following Table. They are arranged in accordance ,with the classification of the Registrar General; the number of each class of disease, is shewn, and the number of each disease of the zymotic class, together with the age at death at eight periods, and the sex and social position of the deceased:— 162 TABLE I.

Determined from the foregoing estimated population after correction made for those public institutions by which the death.register is unduly raised, the death.rate of the past year was 15.2l per 1,000 persons living, or 0.73 higher than that of 1891, but it was 2.39 per 1,000 less than the corrected decennial average. The correction for institutions referred to consists in eliminating from the calculation the population and mortality of the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, St. Peter's Hospital and the Hospital for Incurables the inmates of which are, with a fractional exception, derived from without the sub.district, undergo no natural increase, and are necessarily subject to a high mortality, the amount of which is such as to vitiate any calculation of the death.rate proper to this sub.district derived solely from the death. register. Inclusive of the deaths in hospitals and other institutions situated without the sub.district the rate would be 18.07, but this calculation is faulty from the circumstance that while the deaths of Wandsworth parishioners dying without the sub.district are included, the deaths of non. parisliioners dying within the sub.district are not excluded from the calculation, inasmuch as no present means exist of ascertaining the number of the latter deaths which probably equal the former.

Causation of Mortality On reference to Table I. the relative proportional amount of mortality which resulted from the several groups into which the diseases and other causes of death are classified, are seen to have been as follows : —187 deaths were due to the zymotic and 651 to the non.zymotic group, the latter including constitutional 141; local 106 ; developmental 80 ; and violence 18. Zymotic Diseases. The deaths referred to diseases of this class formed upwards of 22 per cent, of the total mortality, and exceeded the decennial average number by 02, as seen in the following Table, which exhibits the total number of deaths that resulted from these disease*, during the past and ten preceding years and the relative proportion which they bore to the deaths from all causes. The deaths from the seven principal epidemic diseases of' the class are shewn separately, and their increase or decrease in 1892 compared with their preceding decennial averages corrected for increase of population, M 2 168 TABLE IV.

In consequence of the great fatality that results from these diseases, especially amongst young children a more detailed examination of each member of the group may be advantageously made. Small.pox. No case of small.pox was notified during the year. In reference to this disease, the official return of public vaccination made by the vaccination officer to the 169 Local Government Board shews that of the 1,601 children whose births were registered during the year 1891, 1.315 were successfully vaccinated, 121 died unvaccinated; in 38 the operation was postponed on account of sickness; 7 were certified as insusceptible, and the remaining 107 or a little over 6 per cent had removed to places which cither could not be reached or could not be ascertained. Measles. This epidemic which prevailed very extensively in 1690, causing 17 deaths, and 10 in 1891, again became very prevalent during the first three quarters of the past year and resulted in 30 deaths, the corrected average annual number being 27. This great loss of infant life furnishes good reason for the adoption of the "notification " of this disease. Scarlet Fever. Although very extensively prevalent throughout the year this disease was attended with comparatively slight fatality. The total number of cases notified was 303, of which 113 were removed to hospital where 1 died; of the remainder treated at their homes 5 died. The total deaths at home and in hospital being a little under 3 per cent. Erysipelas. This disease increased in severity compared with that of the year previous ; 132 cases were notified and 10 deaths recorded, all in the sub-district. In 1S91 there were 90 cases and no death. Diphtheria. The fatality from this disease was unusually great; 105 cases were notified, 34 cases were removed to hospital where 7 ended fatally, and of those which remained at their homes 20 died, or twice the decennial average number. The total number represents the high death-rate of 25.6 per cent, of attacks. Membranous Croup Of this very fatal disease 12 cases were 170 notified—twice the number of the previous year—and 6 died Fever. Thirty-six cases of fever were notified; they consisted of Enteric 27, Continued 4, and Puerperal 5. Of Enteric-fever 10 were removed to Hospital and recovered ; 1 Continued and 2 Puerperal cases remained at home and ended fatally. Whooping cough. From this disease 28 deaths resulted, or one only more than the average. Not being a notifiable disease its number of cases cannot be ascertained, but its prevalence was extensive during the first seven months of the year to which its fatality was confined. Of the 28 deaths 22 occurred in the winter quarter. Like measles (with which disease it seems somewhat allied) no death from it resulted in the autumn quarter. Diarrhoea. To this disease, which is usually the most fatal of the zymotic class, 41 deaths were referred ; the number is 16 more than in the year preceding, and 7 above the decennial average. With three exceptions all these deaths occurred to infants under 5 years of age, and 35 of whom did not attain one year. This great loss of infant life is usually attributed to improper and irregular feeding in hot weather, and the circumstances that infantile diarrhoea prevails in the summer months and chiefly amongst hand-fed children lends much probability to that view. influenza. The epidemic of this disease, which in 1891 had greatly exceeded that of its predecessor, prevailed last year to a much greater extent, and was attended with much higher fatality. The deaths directly due to it amounted to 44, the highest number resulting from any single disease of the epidemic class, while a still greater fatality as represented by the excess in the deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs was most probably attributable to its agency. 171 Notification of Infectious Diseases. The number of infectious diseases notified during the year was 568, or 168 more than in 1891, and the resulting deaths 55, or 9.6 percent, of all cases notified, compared with 9.75 of the previous year. The numbers of the several diseases, the number of patients scut to Hospital and the number of deaths that occurred in Hospital as well as in the sub-district arc recorded in the following Table .— TABLE V.

With the exception of the second quarter, in which the temperature was 0.6° above the average of 50 years, the temperature of the other quarters was 1.7° below that average. The deaths in each of the first three quarters exceeded those in the fourth by considerably more than two-thirds in number:— TABLE VI. DISEASE. January. February. March. April. May. June. July.

The deaths resulting from these diseases constitute the great bulk of the mortaliy. They formed 651 of the 838 deaths registered. The most fatal of the group were diseases of the organs of respiration numbering 144, 88 being contributed by bronchitis and 56 by pneumonia and its allied affections. Next in order of fatality was the Constitutional class of diseases, which includes Gout and Rheumatism, Cancer and 173 other tumours, Consumption, Scrofula, and other tubercular diseases. It resulted in 141 deaths, Consumption alone causing 58 and Cancer 29 deaths. The latter disease appears to be on the increase. The next most fatal of the group were diseases of the Brain and Nervous system, which caused 123 deaths, or 39 less than the average number; but 86 occurred in the Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum, the inmates of which institution are, as previously stated, derived from without this sub-distribt to which therefore they do not properly belong. Diseases of the Heart and Circulation caused 57 deaths, the number being 13 in excess of the average. To diseases of the Urinary organs the unusually large number of 36 deaths were referred, being 13 above the average. The number of deaths due to diseases of the Digestiveorgans were 31, and 11 less than the average. In the Developmental class 63 deaths resulted from premature birth and congenital defects, and were 7 above the average, while the deaths due to old age, unassociated with disease, were 14 less than the average. The deaths from violence were 18, or half the average number. The deaths from the remaining diseases present no variation needing comment. 174 TABLE VII. COMPARATIVE TABLE OF NON-ZYMOTIC MORTALITY.

As might be anticipated from the general prevalence of epidemic diseases during the past year, the mortality that occurred from those diseases amongst the industrial classes is seen to have been relatively greater than the decennial average; the total mortality amongst them, however, was considerably less than such average, thus maintaining a continuance of the diminution which has for many years been steadily advancing among them, and thereby furnishing a trustworthy indication of sanitary progress in the direction where it was most needed.

The actual death-rate of infants calculated from the number of births registered and the number of deaths that occurred under one year of age, during the year was 14.5 per cent. the decennial average being 12.88. 176 The relative death-rate or the proportion of deaths borne by infants under one year to the total mortality was 26.7 per cent. the average being 23.5. Senile Mortality. The deaths at 70 years of age and upwards wore 129 in number or 11 more than in the year previous and formed 15.3 per cent. of all deaths, the decennial average being 12.5 per cent. The number sex and age of the deceased are tabulated below. The females, as usual, greatly out-number the males in the attainment of longevity, although the highest age attained in the year was that of a male of 97 years:— TABLE IX. Age. Males. Females.

The total number of separate cases that came under treatment was 806, and the deaths were 26, or 3.2 per cent. In the previous year the cases were 857 and the deaths 31, or 3.5 per cent. The cases of epidemic disease numbered 111, and the deaths therefrom 6. The amount of sickness and its fatality therefore were considerably under the average. 177 Inquests, violent Deaths. The number of inquests held during the year was 50, being 3 less than in 1891, thus corresponding with the fewer deaths from violence, and related to the cause of death of 27 males and 23 females. The following Table represents the verdicts returned and the numbers and sex of the deceased:— TABLE X. Males. Females. Total. Deaths from Natural Causes 16 13 29 Deaths from Violence, viz.: — Poisoning by Opium — 1 Suffocation by neglect at Birth —- 2 3 Accidental Suffocation in bed with Parents 2 4 Drowning 5 — From a Fall 2 2 Burns — 1 16 Suicidal Hanging 1 1 Homicidal Execution 1 1 27 23 50 Sanitation. A summary of the sanitary operations conducted during the year is contained in Table 13, on page 96 of the introductory report on the entire district. A great increase in the amount of sanitary work carried out in the sub-district during the past year will be found on reference to the Table. The numbers relating to the several items of procedure show an increase in most of the measures employed, and in some to a very large extent, especially those relating to the removal of nuisances generally. For the abatement of the latter 1,100 preliminary notices and 359 statutory notices were 178 served the number of the former being 273 more, and of the latter 294 more than in the previous year. As a result of the greater prevalence of infectious diseases the number of houses disinfected after such diseases, was increased by 54. Sulphur fumigation continues to be the agent employed for the purpose with undiminished success. In the 317 houses in which it was used, disease recurred in four instances only. When it is considered that upwards of two-thirds of all cases of the kind were treated at the patients' homes such result must be held to be extremely satisfactory. The number of complaints submitted to the local committee and disposed of was 1,267, being a slight increase over that of the previous year. All the cowhouses and slaughter houses were as usual examined and certified as being in a satisfactory state previous to a renewal of the licenses of their owners. The bakehouses also were examined twice in the year and found in a satisfactory condition. Great as was the amount of sanitary work accomplished during the year there is one item in the Table above referred to, viz.:-House to house inspection which shews a diminution that has progressively increased to the present time. I venture to express the hope that this measure of primary importance will not be curtailed in its operation, inasmuch as it forms by the disclosure of existing sanitary defects the first and necessary step for their abatement. It is idle to wait for such disclosure from the public generally who seldom make complaint except uder the pressure of a nuisance which has become intolerable or has already caused sickness or death. It is idle, indeed it is mischevious to let this measure of prevention be postponed to the 179 occurrence of evils which it is intended to prevent, and more importantly is capable of preventing. I am glad to again testify to the satisfactory manner in which the sanitary inspectors have performed their respective duties, and especially to that of Chief Inspector Crane whom I consider a most able and zealous officer. GEORGE EDWARD NICHOLAS, M.D. May 1893. Medical Offi er of Health for Wandsworth, 180 REPORT BY THE PUBLIC ANALYST for the year 1892. To the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District. Gentlemen, In accordance with the annual custom, I beg to submit a statement of the work done in my department, under under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, for the year 1892. The total number of samples submitted by the Inspector was 303, while 7 samples were sent in by various residents of the district under the provisions of the Act; thus making a total of 310 articles as follows:— Nature of Article. Number submitted. Milk 89 Butter 86 Coffee 41 Pepper 15 Mustard 9 Drugs 13 Arrowroot 6 Sugar 2 Condensed Milk 6 Jam 7 Tea 4 Flour 8 Olive Oil 1 Cocoa 3 Oatmeal 7 Lard 6 Vinegar 2 Tapioca 2 Ice Creams 2 Infants' Food 1 181 The total number of articles condemned was 80, thus showing that 9.68 per cent. of the whole were adulterated, as compared with 10 per cent. in the year 1891. The following tables show the nature and amounts of the impurities detected. TABLE I.—Dairy Products. Articles submitted. Amount of Impurity. Butter 100 per cent. Butter 90 „ Butter 75 „ Butter 70 „ Butter 70 „ Butter 50 „ Butter 40 „ Butter 40 „ Milk 46 „ Milk 20 „ Milk 17 „ Milk 16 „ Milk 14 „ Milk 12 „ Milk 12 „ Milk 1 „ Milk 8 „ Milk 8 ,, Milk 7 (& skimmed) Milk 7 per cent. Milk 4 „ Milk 3 „ Milk 3 „ Milk 3 „ Milk 2 „ The above table shows that the definite adulteration of dairy products amounted to nearly 14.3 per cent. of the whole number of such samples examined, as against 13 per cent. last year. N 182 Table II.—Groceries. Articles Submitted. Amount of Impurity. Pepper 50 per cent. of Rice. Coffee 75 per cent. of Chicory. Arrowroot 2 per cent. of Starch. The arrowroot case was evidently one of accidental contamination with ordinary washing starch and as it was not in my opinion a suitable case for prosecution, it was passed over. TABLE III. Nature of Article. Adulteration. Seidlitz Powder Deficient in the amount of both tartaric acid and of Roehelle salt. Few of the popular drugs are so badly supplied to the public as cheap Seidlitz powders (especially when purchased elsewhere than at properly qualified chemists and druggists) they being rarely of the full strength because they are made in enormous quantities, by cheap female labour, without weighing the ingredients; which latter are themselves not uncommonly contaminated with lead. At present we are helpless to suppress such frauds, being barred by the division clauses of the Act, as interpreted by a recent decision to the effect that it is not legal to purchase three powders and to take one of them to the Analyst untouched. It is manifest that, if the powder is divided at the time of purchase, the power of the Analyst to say what weight was in the papers when purchased is entirely done away with. This is one of the many anomalies in the present state of the law urgently calling for amendment. 183 The case of impure infants' food was a remarkable one. A sample of a leading and largely-advertised food was brought in by the instructions of a local medical man as having disagreed with an infant. It was found to contain ll.8 per cent. of sand, and a report was furnished to the applicant, but nothing more was heard of the case. As no manufacturer would wilfully sand such a food, I concluded that the impurity had probably been produced by a defective millstone, but it shows how cautious persons manufacturing such things should be as it was undoubtedly a serious matter. On the whole. I consider that (owing to the systematic way in which the provisions of the Act are carried out under your direction) the food supply of the district must be acknowledged to be in an exceedingly satisfactory condition, except perhaps in the case of dairy products; but I fear, until the penalties arc greatly increased, the temptation to water milk will remain too strong for erring human nature to resist. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN MUTER, Ph.D.; F.R.8.(Edin.); F.I.C., Public Analyst.
