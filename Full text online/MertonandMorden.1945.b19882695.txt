Merton and morden urban District ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1945 AND REPORT OF The Sanitary Inspector Merton and Morden Urban district ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1945 AND REPORT OF The Sanitary Inspector PREFACE. To the Chairman and Members of the Merton and Morden Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Report for the year 1945. The Registrar General has given the population for the year 1945 as 66,050 as compared with 62,760 last year. The total number of births you will see has dropped slightly from 1,157 to 1,053 this year. The comparative statistics for our population continues to be highly favourable. Our infant mortality is 34 per 1,000 live births. Our maternal mortality rate nil and our death rate 9.1 per 1,000 of the population. I am going to suggest that perusal of this Report is prefaced by examination of Table II on page 14. There in tabular form is a kaleidoscope picture of Merton and Morden from its infancy to its present maturity. The scene opens in the year 1913, the last year before our world embarked on the series of international conflicts from which even at this moment we are desperately hoping we have finally emerged. Our community in that year consisted of some 16,000 souls, and in that year 400 new births contributed to a natural increase of population, i.e., excess of births over deaths, of 13.9 per 1,000 compared with to-day a natural increase of only 6.8 per 1,000 of the population. In the next year, 1914, there were 420 births, a figure not to be again achieved until 1929â€” fifteen years later when the population had reached 27,000. In 1914, a population of 17,000 produced 420 babies whereas in 1930 35,000 population produced 452. Exactly double the population and still approximately the same number of babies!! Further there was a natural increase of 278 in 1914 and in 1930 it had fallen to 211. Two other facts of the greatest significance can be deduced from the Table, one that the relatively high birth rates we have experienced in the past few years were similarly experienced in the period 1920-23, and secondly that the Table is highly suggestive of a controlled birth rate, and that the fear sometimes expressed that there is a decline in racial fertility is without foundation. The Table shows that although the population slowly increased, the number of births fell and the birth rate slumped during these years when by the hideous demands of war the best of their procreative potential was being cruelly wasted in Flanders and elsewhere. With the ending of the fighting and 2 the return of the survivors to the community, the births and the birth rate take an upward curve, such a curve as we are experiencing now, but at no time does it reach pre 1914 figures and within ten years the effort is spent. What other detail can we discern in the picture? In view of the concentration of attention on the birth rate, there is perhaps some excuse for venturing some observations of a general character on this complicated question. That there is ample justification for anxiety over the population trend, in spite of the current improvement in the birth rate and the continued fall in the death rate, there is no doubt, that is of course if we accept the belief in the universal importance of the survival of the Western European races and the English and English speaking race for in many parts of the world, the reproduction rate has not fallen. The statistics for our district, although interesting to us, in addition to being too small to provide reliable hypotheses have been confused by recent immigration on a considerable scale of younger age groups of high child bearing capacity and propensity and naturally with the influx of the younger age groups diluting the population, a lower death rate, so that the increase of population in Merton and Morden, that is the excess of births over deaths, does not exactly follow the national pattern. It is this steady reduction in the natural increase of population that is giving rise to so much anxiety, and it is prophesied that it will not be long before it ceases to be an increase and becomes a decrease. While it is true that the downward trend of the birth rate was arrested in 1941 and started to rise, reaching 17.7 in 1944, the highest figure achieved since 1926, this is regarded by experts as an evanescent phenomenon and attributable to the high birth rates following the 1914-18 war which in turn are responsible for the present high marriage and birth rates. The present low death rates are attributable to the same factor, as the high birth rates of that period are held to be responsible for a high proportion of the population in the healthiest period of life, the middle years, and as the population ages the death rates will inevitably rise. In the face of such a statement which points unmistakably to population bankruptcy, the thoughts of the prudent will inevitably turn to economy and thrift as a means of salvation and they will carefully examine to see what economy is being effected and search and probe to see what further saving is possible. Public Health need have no fear of being asked to give an account of its stewardship. It has effected praiseworthy saving in infant life, it has reduced the child bearing risk; by reducing the stillbirth rate it has increased the number of survivals, and by reducing the maternal mortality it has raised the level of continuation of maternal function, both 3 fostering and reproductive. While public health may be entitled to feel complacent if such an enquiry were directed at it, no one knows better that further economy is still possible, and while the mechanism is more often than not social rather than purely medical, that does not seem to justify leaving it entirely in other hands. Apart from the reduction in the general wastage of life outlined above, there are special examples where there is a particular need for attention, e.g., the high infant mortality of illegitimacy and the loss through abortion. Abortion is a complete wastage of fertility. As a reduction of fertility itself is in some places suspected of being one cause of the decreasing birth rate some remedy must be found for this fruitless misdirection of reproduction, as a first step in any attempt to secure an increase in the births. A reduction of illegitimacy will only indirectly raise the legitimate birth rate in so far as the potential can be diverted by social measures into securer channels; more important and far reaching will be its effect on the quality of the population, but better provision for the care of the illegitimate infant wall attack the infant mortality rate at its most vulnerable point. Lest this public health prospectus encourages even the prudent to relaxation and complacency, it is a matter of regret that it is prophesied that even these measures when they are practically applied will not be sufficient to reverse the population trend without a very substantial and permanent change in the reproduction rate, and so seriously is it regarded in one Scandinavian country at least, that an active legislative policy has been adopted in an attempt to effect this correction. How far social legislation of this sort is capable of influencing population trends is a matter for speculation. Fortunately our part is much simpler, it is to secure the highest survival rate possible, with the highest possible quality of survivor. There are no very significant epidemicalogical events to record for the year. Measles with 760 cases assumed perhaps almost epidemic proportions, but as is later recorded, the disease generally was mild and there were no deaths. There were 114 cases of Scarlet Fever and 77 cases of Whooping Cough; both figures can be considered as average low annual figures. There were 139 new cases of T.B. added to the register and 45 deaths from this disease; those are also average annual figures. There are only 8 recorded cases of Dysentery but there is evidence that mild intestinal infections have been much more widespread than the number of notifications of such disturbances or Dysentery would suggest. It is fervently to be hoped that we shall speedily get back to pre-war standards of hygiene as 4 regards food handling, and indeed that we shall continue to strive to improve upon those standards; there is undoubtedly ample room for improvement. No report on the environmental conditions, as they affect the health of the public, would be complete without some reference to housing standards. Never in the history of local government was the question of housing so difficult and so serious in its effect on the public well being, but fortunately it is also true that the need for remedy was never so universally agreed and determined upon. In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks to the members of the Council and of the Public Health and Maternity and Child Welfare Committees for their support and encouragement, in the public health work of the district. To the members of the staff of the public health department I would like to pay tribute for their personal interest and devotion to the service. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, A. W. JOHNS. September, 1946. 5 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL of MERTON and MORDEN 1 845 NO. 3 COMMITTEE (SERVICES). Chairman : Mrs. H.

Vital Statistics for the year maintain the satisfactory standard of previous years, the figures comparing very favourably with those of the country as a whole. The birth rate was 15.5 per 1,000 population, with a total number of live births of 1,027. The death rate was 9 per 1,000 population comparing with the corresponding figure for England and Wales of 11.4. The infant mortality rate was 33.1 per 1,000 live births as compared with a figure of 46 for England and Wales. As mentioned in previous reports, the effect of what is probably a low population estimate is to raise these figures slightly, and while this gives an exaggerated picture of the birth rate, we can console ourselves with the reflection that the death rate is correspondingly raised. The total deaths from all causes was 602 and the total live births 1,027, giving, therefore, a natural increase of population of 425. 9 The appended table sets out the comparison for the past five years of the local infant mortality rate with that for England and Wales. It will be seen that the local rate is consistently very considerably below that for the whole country; in the last two years approximately half. England and Wales.

It is to be hoped that this will be the last year of conditions conducive to this result and that next year we shall see a return to normal figures. As it has been pointed out before, there is a relatively high mortality rate among these infants, 95 per 1,000 births as compared with 29 per 1,000 for legitimate births. This higher mortality rate can probably also be regarded as a reasonably accurate index of the relative care bestowed on the two categories. 10 SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS.

This figure is low compared with an estimate based on occupied dwellings such as is used for local computation of the ward population. The Registrar General has again provided an estimate of the population under five and between five and fifteen. This has been done primarily to secure uniformity in calculation of immunisation figures, as there is a tendency to wide variation from district to district in locally compiled estimates. The figures for the age group 0-4 inclusive is 4,720 and for the age group 5-14 inclusive is 9,480. BIRTHS. The registered live births totalled 1,027, a decrease of 124 on the previous year; and the birth rate has shown a corresponding fall from 18.3 to 15.5 per 1,000 of the population. Of the total live births 492 were males and 535 females. There were 63 illegitimate births; of these 29 were males and 34 females. There were 26 stillbirths; 13 male and 13 female. INSTITUTIONAL AND DOMICILIARY BIRTHS. The tendency of recent years towards increased Institutional confinements continued and in 1945 seventy-three per cent. of the births which occurred took place in hospitals or nursing homes, as follows:â€” St. Helier Hospital 341 Nelson Hospital 216 Kingston County Hospital 22 Other hospitals, institutions and nursing homes 194 773 13 TABLE II.

The number of registered deaths after adjustment by transferable deaths, is given below :â€” 602 total deaths, of which 322 were males and 280 females. The seasonal mortality is indicated by the deaths for each quarter of the year, which were:â€” First quarter 189 Second quarter 121 Third quarter 116 Fourth quarter 176 14 Inquests. Inquests were held on 26 deaths occurring in the district, 14 of which were in respect of residents. The verdicts returned were as follows:â€” (1) Natural Causes 4 (2) Suicide byâ€” Coal Gas Poisoning 5 Fall from Roof 1 Fall from Window 1 Strangulation by Hanging 1 â€” 8 (3) Accidental Deaths- Asphyxia from Smoke Fumes 1 Collisions with Motor Vehicles 4 Fall in Home 3 Fall from Trolley-bus 1 Knocked down by Pedal Cycle 1 Run over by Train 1 â€” 11 (4) Misadventureâ€” Death by Drowning 1 Death by Electrocution 1 Fall from Roof 1 â€” 3 26 The total number of inquests held were six more than in the year before. Road accidents were responsible for six of the total accidental deaths, compared with two for the previous year. CAUSES OF DEATH. Heart Disease, with 142 deaths, was the commonest cause of death and next in order of frequency once more comes Cancer with 116 deaths. In considering the question of heart disease being represented statistically as the commonest cause of death, and before coming to the conclusion that heart disease is a common disease, it should be remembered that it is given a high priority on the selection list of Causes of Death, where two or more conditions are recorded on the death certificate, and as heart failure in one form of nomenclature or another appears on the majority of death certificates it inevitably achieves the highest 15 aggregate. The appended tables shows an analysis of the numbers in the various age groups allocated to Heart Disease:â€” Age Group No. of Deaths Age Group No. of Deaths 90 and over 5 55-60 6 86-90 5 50-55 4 80-85 10 45-50 4 75-80 17 40-46 â€” 70-75 14 35-40 8 66-70 7 35 and under 6 60-65 13 It will be seen that 37 were 75 and over and of all the deaths attributed to heart disease 71, or 77 per cent., occurred in persons of 60 and over. Ten of the 37 deaths over 75 were 85 or over, and 5 of them 90 or over. It is a cruel trick of fate having lived to 90 years of age to be stricken down with heart disease. Surely senility would be a truer description of the cause of these deaths; and it would have the advantage of presenting a more accurate picture of the disease. In view of the importance of increasing our knowledge of Rheumatism, an acute form of which is regarded as the commonest cause of heart disease, this question assumes even greater importance lest it be argued that heart disease, being the commonest cause of death and acute Rheumatism being the commonest cause of heart disease, acute Rheumatism is the commonest disease. Another interesting point to be seen in this analysis is that only 21 or 23 per cent, of deaths from heart disease occurred under 60 and that the two biggest groupings are 13 between 60-65 and 17 between 75-80. While deductions must be made with the greatest hesitation from such small numbers as this and locally compiled, it would seem that further study on a larger scale might well be valuable. The other causes responsible for the greater proportion of deaths are in orderâ€”Cancer, Intercranial Vascular Lesions and Tuberculosis. Reference to the Table on page 17 shows that the death rate from Cancer remains, as last year, at the highest level for ten years at 1.7 per 1,000 population. There were actually 116 deaths in 1945 as against 107 in 1944, the increase in the population figure is responsible for the unaltered rate. There were 45 deaths from Tuberculosis in 1945 as against 37 last year, the rate per 1,000 population being 0.68 as against 0.58 for the previous year. 16 CANCER DEATH RATE.

There were 34 deaths of infants under one year of age, of whom 20 were male and 14 female. The infant mortality rate for the year is 33.1 per 1,000 live births as compared with 28.7 for the previous year. The rate for England and Wales as a whole is 46 per 1,000 live births. Of the 34 deaths recorded 29 were neo-natal. This is a high proportion and conversely 5 deaths other than neo-natal out of a total of 1,027 births is a very low figure. A high proportion of neo-natal deaths are attributable to injuries at birth and is regarded as an index of obstetrics rather than of infant welfare. Deaths of infants under one year of age which are not neo-natal are of course an important index of infant welfare. Further information with regard to deaths from Prematurity will be found in the section dealing with premature babies. 19 20 Infant Deathsâ€”With causes of death.

Since December, 1944, prematurity is required to be indicated on the birth notification card by recording the birth weight in all infants of 5|lbs. and under at birth. In 1945 in this area there were 27 of these notified births, of whom 19 were born in hospital and 8 in their own homes. Fuller details will be seen in the appended Table. The total number of premature babies notified during 1945 were as follows, born:â€” (a) At home 8 (b) In hospital 19 The number of those born at home:â€” (a) Who were nursed entirely at home 4 (b) Who died during the first 24 hours 2 (c) Who survived at the end of one month 2 The number of those born in hospital:â€” (a) Who died during the first 24 hours 5 (b) Who survived at the end of one month 14 In view of the high mortality among premature babies and in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Health in 1944, special arrangements were made for their care, particularly of those born at home. The arrangements consist of the provision of special equipment including a specially designed cradle. In addition a children's specialist has been appointed, who is available to any practitioner for purposes of consultation. It appeared obvious from the inception of these arrangements that the very special provision for these infants should necessitate special hospital provision and St. Helier County Hospital made this provision for its adjoining areas. Provision, which in addition to a babies' ward designed and equipped for this particular purpose, included transport arrangements from the home to the hospital by an ambulance equipped with an incubator cradle. The main lines of further progress in this particular field of preventive medicine would appear to be further extension of the St. Helier type of hospital provision and a more extended use of the facilities provided. It should not be overlooked that the normal habitat of the less than 40 week fcetus is in Uterus and no pains should be spared to keep him there until the appointed time. Transport too should be effected whenever at all possible, not with 21 Sex Age Cause of Death Male 4 minutes Broncho-Pneumonia. Congenital Morbus Cordis. Female 3 weeks Broncho-Pneumonia. Female 7 months Cerebral Spinal Meningitis. the baby in the incubator in the ambulance, but with the baby in utero in the ambulance. To effect this, which must surely be the optimum arrangement, premature labour must be generally recognised to be an indication for immediate hospitalisation when parturition is inevitable. This seems to a large extent to be a matter for educational propaganda. It will be seen from the tabulated statement given above that, of 8 notified births occurring at home, only 2 lived one month or a death rate of 75 per cent., whereas of those occurring in hospital 5 out of 19 did not live one month, a death rate of 26 per cent. Premature Deaths. Of the 29 neo-natal deaths recorded it is interesting to note that 14 were attributed to Prematurity. The following table shows the place of birth, the period of survival and, where available, the birth weight of the babies. In 5 cases where the birth weight is not available the infants were born in institutions outside the district. Of the 14 deaths recorded from Prematurity 13 occurred in hospital and one at home. Of this 13 four were born at home and admitted to hospital after birth. Place of Birth Period of Survival Birth Weight Place of Birth Period of Survival Birth Weight Domiciliary 1 day 3 lbs.

The Council makes an annual contribution to the funds of each and arrangements have been agreed for nursing assistance to be available for cases referred through the Council's Health Services. (1) The Merton Parish Nurse Fund employs one nurse for general nursing; no midwifery or maternity nursing is undertaken. The district served is approximately the ecclesiastical parish of St. Mary's. A total of 180 cases involving 1,440 visits were attended during the year and of these 15 cases were children under 5 years of age, to whom 66 visits were made. 22 (2) The St. Helier District Nursing Association employs one nurse for general nursing. No midwifery or maternity nursing is undertaken. Its activities cover the whole of the Merton and Morden portion of the St Helier Estate and in addition that part situated in the Carshalton Urban District lying to the North of Reigate Avenue. During the year 144 cases were dealt with by the St. Helier District Nursing Association, 10 of these were children under 5 years of age. The total number of visits made was 3,848, of which 57 were in respect of children under 5 years. (3) The Wimbledon District Nursing Association serves Wimbledon and the western part of this district. Two nurses are employed for general nursing in Merton and Morden. The Laboratory Facilities. The routine laboratory work for district is undertaken by the Nelson Hospital. The appended Table shows the pathological work undertaken during the year:â€” Examinations. No. performed.

Cases of infectious disease, where they are admitted to Isolation Hospital, are conveyed by ambulances of the Wandle Valley Joint Hospital Board. Non-Infectious Cases. The Council maintain one general purpose ambulance fully staffed and one ex-Army vehicle in reserve. The reciprocal arrangements previously of an informal nature were made the basis of a more formal arrangement between Sutton and Cheam, Carshalton, Mitcham and 28 figures relating to cases and visits in this district during the year are as follows:â€” Cases.

The service continues to cater for ambulance patients who are required to attend out-patient departments of hospitals for treatment. Work continues on a voluntary basis and the transport is provided by public spirited persons who put themselves and their vehicles at the disposal of the organisation. A charge of 3d. per mile is made to'cover partly the actual running cost. This cost is met by the Council for residents in the district. These arrangements are a most valuable extension of the ambulance facilities provided in the district. 24 CLINICS AND TREATMENT CENTRES. 1.â€”Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics (provided by the Council).

The County Council administers the Venereal Diseases Regulations and participates in the London and Home Counties scheme. Under this arrangement treatment is available at the principal London Hospitals and at the St. Helier County Hospital. The sessions are numerous and in some cases continuous, whilst many of these institutions provide in-patient as well as out-patient treatment. HOSPITALS. Smallpox. The Surrey County Isolation Hospital, Clandonâ€”accommodation 28 beds. This hospital is organised on a care and maintenance basis ready to be opened up at any time for the reception of cases of Small Pox. There were no such cases during the year. Infectious Disease. The Wandle Valley Hospital under a Joint Hospital Board serves this area together with three other neighbouring areas, Mitcbam, Beddington and Wallington and Coulsdon and Purley. The hospital has accommodation for 196 patients, including cubicle isolation for 38. During the year 129 patients from our district have been treated in the hospital. Reference to Table VI shows in detail the conditions for which admission was necessitated. The staffing problems referred to in the previous year's report have not eased in any way, and the standard of treatment and care maintained in the face of all these difficulties is a matter for congratulation to the hospital staff. 26 Table VI.

The district is well served by hospitals and the closest liaison and fullest co-operation is maintained with the hospitals serving the area. Those engaged in both services realise that something more than friendly neutrality between two sets of organisations working in the same field should be achieved and both by frequent personal contact and a belief that the best interest of the public is our obligation. The hospital contribution to public health even in our own particular field of preventive medicine is too rarely appreciated. One has only to recall the multiplicity of arrangements made with general and special hospitals by local authorities in the detection and treatment of such conditions as deformities, eye diseases, ear infections, the availability of children's specialists and in-patient accommodation for investigation of special conditions beyond the scope of the clinics, to realise that the local authority health service has had at its elbow a comprehensive ancilliary service which has supported and enhanced the work of the 27 authority's clinics. It is obviously in the best interests of both services and of the public that they shall work even closer together. 1. The Nelson Hospital for Wimbledon, Merton and district. The accommodation of this voluntary hospital, to whose funds the Council makes an annual grant, is 113 beds, 21 of which are maternity beds. The following information relating to the hospital's activities during the year under review is supplied by the courtesy of the Secretary:â€” (a) General Medical and Surgical Treatment. Total in-patients admitted 1,368 Number from Merton and Morden 537 Total number of new out-patients 7,619 Number from Merton and Morden 3,401 (b) Maternity Services.

The County and Public Assistance Hospitals. The hospital provision for the area has been greatly improved by the St. Helier Hospital which is in the Carshalton district. A considerable proportion of general and special cases from the southern parts of the area are dealt with by this hospital. In addition to 795 medical and surgical beds the hospital has a most up-to-date maternity wing of 67 beds. The maternity unit includes 25 single bed wards. There are in addition 30 ante-natal beds included in the general hospital accommodation, 4 of which are single bed wards. This makes a complement of 97 beds for maternity, of which 29 is in the form of cubicle accommodation. Reference has been made elsewhere in this report to the valuable work undertaken by the hospital in the provision for special treatment for premature births in the area. 28 Tuberculosis. The County Sanatorium, Milfordâ€”300 beds. The Surrey County Council is responsible for the AntiTuberculosis Scheme in the district. The County Sanatorium at Milford constitutes the main institutional provision, and 20 persons were admitted from Merton and Morden during 1945, whilst 77 other persons received treatment in other institutions. In Surrey, as in other counties, the Sanatoria accommodation is inadequate to meet the present demands made upon it. Every effort is being made by using other accommodation and by selection of cases to mitigate the shortage which is largely contributed to by shortage of nursing staff. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. Public Health Act, 1936, Section 203â€”Notification of Births. The births notified under Section 203 as adjusted by transferred notification were:â€” Live Births 1,013 Notified by Midwives 435 Still Births 23 Notified by doctors and parents Transferred from 27 other districts 574 1,036 1,036 The Work of the Centres. Reference to Table VIII, page 32, show that the attendances at the Welfare Centres were well up to the figures for the previous years and considerably higher than for last year, in fact, there were 3,577 infant and 3,286 child attendances more in 1945 than in 1944. A considerable increase was to be expected in view of the drop in 1944 owing to the flying bomb attacks in the summer of that year. The figures, however, compared with the immediate pre-war figures in 1938 and 1939 suggest that the peak reached in those pre-war years has been recovered. It is worthy of record that in 1944, 58 per cent, and in 1945 66 per cent, of the expectant mothers in the district received ante-natal care in our clinics. When one remembers that a proportion of our expectant mothers attend hospital 20 ante-natal clinics, The Nelson and St. Helier, apart from those under private supervision, it will be appreciated that there are not many women to-day in our area who do not receive medical supervision throughout their pregnancies. It will be seen by reference to Table VIII that the average attendance at three of our ante-natal clinics is over 20 per session. To achieve such an average means that attendances at some of these sessions are regularly very considerably in excess of 20 and it is these that must be considered to obtain a true picture; in fact, attendances have been frequently in excess of 40 per session although it appears that our responsibility for this work may soon cease, some scatter of this concentration is becoming urgent. It is greatly to the credit of our Ante-Natai Officer that this increasing volume, of perhaps the most important work in the whole field of piiblic health, has been accomplished at, a standard which justly entitles the authority to be proud of this service. It will be seen from the figures given on page 32 that at two of the infant welfare centres the average attendance during the year is over 50 and in one case over 60. It ought to be pointed out that at the Morden Clinic which shows an actual average attendance of 31.9 that one session originally set aside for Diphtheria Immunisation shows so few attendances that it practically does not count as a session and to get a proper picture of the attendance picture there, the average should be based on 100 sessions not on 150 as calculated in the report. This would give an average attendance of .47.8. As 1 have pointed out with regard to the ante-natal sessions, where an average number of attendances is 50, there will be many sessions greatly in excess of this number. This is important, as the reputation of the clinics depends on the reactions of the individuals attending and at a mother's first attendance, perhaps her only attendanceâ€”if the number is overwhelmingly large so that she is unable to secure an uninterrupted private audience with the Health Visitor for a reasonable length of time, she is deprived of a service which it is our function to provide. It is important, therefore, to keep constantly in mind that if the standard of service is to be maintained, staffing arrangements must keep pace with attendances. 30 TABLE VII.

A maternity clinic is held at the Nelson Hospital every Tuesday afternoon for the antenatal and post-natal examinations of women who have booked for admission, or who have been confined at the hospital. An arrangement exists whereby Merton and Morden women attending the hospital clinic may receive dental treatment under the Council's Scheme. An Ophthalmic Clinic is held every Friday and a Pediatric Clinic, which is held every Monday, was opened on 8th November. The Infant Clinic was closed on 26th July. The hospital is a voluntary organisation serving Wimbledon, Merton and Morden. The following information, kindly supplied by the Secretary, indicates the work of the hospital clinics during the year. 38 Infant Clinic. From Merton and Morden.

While T would once again emphasise the dangers of placing absolute reliance on figures as an index of accomplishment, the records for the year 1945 do nevertheless show a very large increase in visits in all categories over the previous year. The total visits made by the Health Visitors were 9,688 last year, compared with 7,919 for the previous year. It is of interest that there were over 100 more visits to expectant mothers, compared with the previous year. One of the reasons for this increase is the large number of cases making application to St. Helier County Hospital for admission and who are referred to this department for a Health Visitor's report on the home conditions to estimate the need for hospitalisation. While this has entailed a considerable amount of extra visiting for the staff, the opportunity presented in this way for our Health Visitors to make additional contacts with our expectant mothers was welcomed. It will also be noted that there were 128 visits made to foster children. As there were 9 foster children in the area for whose supervision we are responsible this means that each child was visited on an average 14 times during the year. This brief resume of the domicilary work of the Health Visitors for the first post-war year gives sufficient indication of the response that these highly trained personnel will make to the increased demands inevitably to be made on them in the future. 34 The number of visits made for various purposes was as shown below:â€” To expectant mothersâ€”first visits total visits 498 816 To children under 1 yearâ€”first, visits total visits 1,184 3,675 To children 1-5 yearsâ€”total visits 4,733 Visits re puerperal pyrexia, ophthalmia neonatorum and miscellaneous 336 Visits to foster children re child life protection 128 9,688 In addition to closely co-operating with our own Day Nurseries, the Health Visitors have attended at the routine medical inspections of nursery children in the schools, to afford assistance to the School Medical Officer and Head Mistresses of the schools with their more intimate knowledge of these children. Convalescent Home Treatment. Children requiring treatment are sent to Convalescent Homes through the agency of the Invalid Children's Aid Association, to whom the council makes a contribution towards the cost of the treatment. Orthopaedic Treatment. Children suffering from orthopaedic defects are referred to the Nelson Hospital under the general arrangement with that Hospital for the treatment of children attending the Welfare centres. Maternity Hospital Treatment. The arrangements with Queen Charlotte's Hospital, whereby complicated cases were admitted there, has fallen into disuse through the war and because facilities are now available for dealing with these locally. It will be seen in the section dealing with Hospitals that there are 21 beds in the Nelson Hospital and 67 beds in the St. Helier County Hospital. Since Chemotherapy has to a large extent supplanted surgery in the treatment of Puerperal Pyrexia, cases complicated by pyrexia are now provided for in the Wandle Valley Isolation Hospital. 35 The following table shows the use of the maternity accommodation in the district in the year under review:â€” Nelson Hospital 216 Kingston County Hospital 22 St. Helier County Hospital 341 Other Hospitals 194 773 Emergency Maternity Unit. There were no calls made on this unit during the year under review. Consultant Service. A specialist's opinion may be had in cases of obstructed labour, emergencies in pregnancy, or puerperal pyrexia. Home Help Scheme. The extension of the Home Help arrangements to make provision for cases outside the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme, such as aged and infirm and cases of illness, which would not be eligible under that scheme, did not bring the overwhelming demand anticipated at the inception. The Home Help staff during the year under review consisted of one full-time employee and seven employed part-time for as many hours as they were capable of giving. The work is arranged and supervised by an organiser who combines this work with duties under the Maternity and Child Welfare Dental Scheme as Dental Attendant and Clerk. In addition to the 35 maternity and child welfare cases, of whom 30 were lying-in eases, 16 cases were dealt with under the extended arrangements. Of this number 4 were in receipt of this assistance from the inception of the scheme to the end of the year. While it can be claimed that no request for such assistance when the need was urgent was left unaided, the re-arrangement of the disposition of the staff was, at times, a matter of considerable difficulty and emphasised the value and importance of the work of the Home Help Organiser. Although for the period covered by this report, recruiting of additional staff was quite impossible, since then, however, the position has been eased considerably. The number of Home Helps provided to residents of the district during the year were as follows :â€” Service Full Cost Partial Cost Free of Cost Total Ante and Post Natal 3 2 â€” 5 Maternity 13 14 3 30 Domestic 6 6 6 16 Total for year 21 22 8 61 36 Sterilised Maternity Outfits. Sterile outfits in sealed containers for use at confinements may be had from the welfare centres or from the Council's midwife. They are supplied at cost price and, in necessitous cases, at half price or free of cost according to means. During the year 30 outfits were supplied, 29 at cost price and one free of charge. Dental Scheme. During the year a very considerable increase in the use of the dental clinics was made, when 349 mothers and children made 954 attendances as against 232 persons and 702 attendances in the year before.

According to notices received by the Surrey County Council, there were sixteen midwives practising in the district, of whom five were salaried midwives appointed under the County Scheme and eight members of the staff of the Nelson Hospital. Voluntary Helpers. A gratifying feature of our welfare services in the district is the contribution made voluntarily by a loyal and devoted band of women inspired by the motive of service and it is one of the advantages in compiling this annual record of the activities of the public health department that it affords me an opportunity of expressing my thanks to them and to draw attention to the value of their work. Child Life Protection. It will be seen that there are 8 foster-mothers and 9 foster children under the supervision of our Health Visitors who act as Child Life Protection Visitors for the purposes of the Infant Life Protection powers provided for in the Public Health Act, 1936. 115 visits were paid to these homes during the year, which is an average of 14 visits per home per year. As has been mentioned before we find it impossible to recruit fostermothers even to serve for short periods in cases of emergency where a mother is suddenly removed to hospital and a home is required to be .found for the child or children. Information from the County Public Health Department is to the effect that there are no children boarded out in our district by the Surrey County Council under public assistance or other arrangements. Further assurances have been received that information would be passed to the department if any such children were boarded out in our area. The following are the main facts relating to child life protection work ditring the year:â€” Registered homes under supervision during the year 16 Registered homes under supervision at end of year 8 New homes registered during the year 7 Children on register at end of year 9 Children brought on to register during year 17 Children removed out of district during year 12 Visits paid to nurse children 115 Number of children who died during year â€” Number of cases where-legal proceedings taken â€” 39 SECTION C.â€”SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES. Water Supply. The district is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and by the Sutton District Water Company. Their respective distributive areas are approximately the parishes of Merton and Morden respectively. The supply of the Metropolitan Water Board is only sampled infrequently as a routine, otherwise samples are taken when circumstances indicate the necessity for local investigation. The Board supplies copies of their official minutes in which the results of their examinations are recorded. Routine examinations of the Sutton District Water Company's supply are undertaken by the Authorities in the supply area upon an agreed rota which provides for bacteriological and chemical samples each month. The Company in addition to the daily examinations undertaken by their own full-time Chemist arrange for Consulting Chemists to undertake monthly examinations. Copies of the reports of these Consulting Chemists are received by local Medical Officers of Health whilst the records of the Company's own analysis are available for inspection by the Medical Officers. The quality of the supply as shown by the sampling was satisfactory. There are three deep wells in the district, the supplies from which are used mainly for industrial purposes. Drawn from beneath the London clay, these well waters are of a high degree of organic purity. Drainage and Sewerage. The Surrey County Council's major scheme for the improvement of the Beverley and Pyl Brooks referred to in previous reports, was completed during the year 1939. This work, in conjunction with other improvements carried out down stream, has been effectual in relieving the surcharge of this waterway. No alterations were carried out during the year under review. Closet Accommodation. All premises have water closets drained to sewers except four which are drained to cesspools. In addition there are four chemical pail closets on Sports Grounds. Public Cleansing. The collection and disposal of house refuse throughout the district is presenting much difficulty because of the shortage of staff. 40 The salvage tonnage for the year under review was as follows:â€” Tons Tons Paper 199 Bottles and Glass 120 Metals 23 Rags 18 Pig Food 841 REPORT OF THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit an abbreviated Annual Report which summarises the work carried out by your Sanitary Inspectors during the year ended 31st December, 1945. Housing Conditions. In Merton and Morden houses occupied by, or suitable for the occupation of persons defined as " working classes " are, in my opinion generally of a high standard, but unfortunately in the older parts of the district, there are a substantial number of dwellings which, but for the outbreak of the late World War, would no doubt have been dealt with as Clearance Areas, or as individually unfit houses as provided for by the Housing Act, 1936. Owing to the cessation of maintenance repairs as a result of the war years, there has been a progressive deterioration, sometimes amounting to actual decay, of the poorer type of houses situated particularly in the north-eastern part of the district. The condition of the properties has been aggravated by damage by enemy action. Shortage of labour and of materials has made it impossible to proceed to any appreciable extent under the provisions of the Housing Act and so alleviate those insanitary conditions which are prevalent and common, not only to this Urban District but to the country as a whole. The provision of new houses must of course take first priority but one trusts that as this progresses there will soon be a sufficient supply of labour and materials available for maintaining existing houses in all respects fit for human habitation. It is hoped that the time is not far distant when it will not be possible to claim that lack of materials prevent the execution of repairs essential to the health and well-being of those who live under the present unsatisfactory conditions. Housing Inspections. The total number of houses inspected during the year for " sanitary defects" under the Public Health and Housing Acts was 457. Action taken in connection with defective dwelling houses is set out in the housing table on pages 48 and 49. Notices specifying the necessary work required to remedy sanitary defects were served upon owners of properties as follows:â€” Intimation notices 375 Statutory notices:â€” Public Health Act, 1936 42 Housing Act, 1936 9 41 Eradication of Bed Bug's. Thirty-four houses were found on inspection to be infested with bed bugs and are classified as follows in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry's Circular:â€” Council Houses Other Houses Total 5 29 34 Of the 34 houses infested 33 were treated by spraying with Vermicine," and one by fumigation with sulphur-dioxide together with the use of blow-lamps. In one case van-disinfestation of furniture was carried out. Drainage Work. At 15 houses the drainage systems were entirely reconstructed and at 64 houses extensive repairs to drains were carried out. Smoke and water tests were applied to the drains of houses in 75 instances, and obstructions were removed from drains at 119 houses. Food Supply. The total number of inspections made to premises where articles of food are prepared or exposed for sale was 1,142. At 17 premises improvements in sanitary conditions were elfected. Unsound Food. The undermentioned articles of food were found, upon inspection, to be unfit for human consumption; were surrendered and either destroyed or disposed of for animal feeding or salvage:â€” Description.

Practically the whole of the home killed meat is prepared in central abattoirs, but pig clubs established for the war period are allowed to slaughter on their premises if found suitable. Several of the pig clubs in the surrounding districts take advantage of this arrangement and use the registered slaughter-house attached to the Trafalgar Pig Club at 129 High Street, Merton.

There are no producers of milk registered within the Urban District. Practically all the milk supplied to the district is derived from the South Eastern Counties and arx-ives either by rail or road. 67 inspections were made to dairies and milk shops during 1945. Twenty-three samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination during the year and all were reported as satisfactory. Twenty-six licences were granted to dealers under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936, and were in force at 31st December, 1945. 43 Food and Drugs Act, 1938.

A number of inspections were made of the water courses in the district for the purpose of detecting pollutions and samples were obtained and sent for chemical analysis. Mosquitoes. A number of complaints were received from residents and paraffin spraying of ditches and stagnant ponds was carried out. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919â€”The Infestation Order, 1943. The Rats and Mice Destruction Act is administered by the Council, the Surrey County Council having delegated their powers to the Local Authority. A part-time rodent operator is employed and a free service is provided for householders. During the year under review 1,494 visits were made to premises where infestations were known or suspected and 108 premises were cleared. Shops Acts, 1912-1936.

(See Sanitary Inspector's Report, on pages 42-45). 49 SECTION Fâ€” INFECTIOUS ILLNESS. Notification. The following diseases are notifiable in the Urban District:â€” Cholera Acute Primary Pneumonia Cerebro-Spinal Fever Acute Influenzal Pneumonia Continued Fever Acute Poliomyelitis Diphtheria (including Acute Polio-Encephalitis membranous Croup) Puerperal Pyrexia Dysentery Relapsing Fever Enteric Fever (including Scarlet Fever paratyphoid fevers) Smallpox Erysipelas Trench Fever Encephalitis Lethargica Typhus Fever Food Poisoning Tuberculosis (all forms) Malaria Whooping Cough Ophthalmia Neonatorum Measles Plague Smallpox. There were no notifications of Smallpox in our district during the year. Service and other contacts arriving from abroad necessitated a considerable amount of supervision and in some cases some anxiety, as in many of the households to which these contacts returned there were one or more unvaccinated members of the family, often adolescents. We have been fortunate in Merton and Morden in not having had an infectious case of Smallpox for some years. Enteric Fever, There have been no cases of Typhoid occurring in the district during the year. There was one case however which was diagnosed as Paratyphoid after serum tests had been done in the St. Helier County Hospital. On admission to hospital he was regarded as a case of Dysentery. No organisms were isolated from the stool and the diagnosis was made only on the agglutination reactions. No evidence of any source of infection could be discovered. Dysentery. There were 8 cases of Dysentery notified during the year as against 27 in the previous year. There were no deaths among these cases. Reference to the summary of vital statistics gives 2 deaths of children under 2 from Diarrhoea compared with four for the previous year. Scarlet Fever. There were 114 cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year as compared with 231 for the year before. Scarlet Fever continues to be a mild disease and there were no deaths attributed to this condition during the year. 50 Diphtheria. Twelve civilian cases were finally diagnosed as Diphtheria during the year as compared with a new low record of 8 for the previous year. There was one death from this disease during the year. Measles. Measles seems almost to have changed from a biennial to an annual epidemic. There were 760 cases notified during the year. The number of cases has been almost up to epidemic scale each year for the past six years. In 1941 there were over 2,000 cases, in 1942â€”942, 1943â€”433, and in 1944 there were 252. In addition to losing its biennial character it seems also to have lost much of its severity and this year, out of 760 cases, there were no deaths. It has long been recognised that Measles took its toll mainly from the illnourished and that poverty has always played a significant part in the mortality and consequent morbidity. It is justifiable to assume that the better general standards of nutrition among these age groups, and the relatively high level of social and economic standards prevailing among this population, constitute an important contribution towards this result. Whooping Cough. According to the notifications received Whooping Cough was less prevalent than in the previous year, 77 cases being notified as against 183 in the previous year. There were no deaths from this disease. Anterior Poliomyelitis. Two cases of Infantile Paralysis were notified during the year, one of which received hospital treatment. There were no deaths, Cerebro-Spinal Fever. Three cases were notified during the year and received hospital treatment. In one ease the patient succumbed to the infection. Erysipelas. Fifteen notifications were received during the year and of this number 14 were treated at home and one received hospital treatment. Food Poisoning. No case of food poisoning was notified during the year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Twelve cases were notified, of which 9 were in hospital and 3 at home. In 11 cases recovery was complete and vision remained unimpaired. In one case the vision was lost. Pneumonia. There were 71 cases of Pneumonia, of which 5 were stated to be influenzal in origin. The number of cases notified in the previous year was 46. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were 4 notifications of Puerperal Pyrexia, giving a rate of 3.8 per thousand total births. Of the 51 4 cases 3 occurred in hospitals and one at home. Treatment of these cases is now undertaken by the Wandle Valley Hospital and during the year 2 of the cases were admitted for treatment.

It will be seen that 865 children under 5 years were immunised during the year. Of this number 806 were immunised in the Council's clinics. This figure is an improvement on last year's figure of 515, but none the less it is hoped that the 1946 figure will show a further improvement. There were 1,150 births in 1944 and therefore some 1,150 babies arrived at the age of 1 year some time or other during 1945 and should have been immunised. Until the number of immunisations approaches more nearly to the previous year's births it cannot be regarded as satisfactory. It has been the practice to immunise about the end of the first year and at all events as soon after the first birthday as possible. It will be seen in the table showing the age distribution of immunised children that there were only four children who were immunised in the under 1 year age group. Modern opinion on immunological practice is in favour of earlier immunisation and at the time of writing this report steps are being taken to secure earlier protection against Diphtheria. In another part of this report a death from Diphtheria is recorded of a child thirteen months of age. To have secured immunity this infant would have had to receive his first injection at something like ten months of age and his second not later than eleven months of age. While the mortality in this age group is relatively small, in view of the present trend of expert opinion that immunisation can be effectively carried out before one year old, we are now endeavouring to secure earlier immunisation. 56 TUBERCULOSIS. One hundred and thirty-nine new cases were added to the register of tuberculous persons, compared with 140 in 1944. These additions were:â€” Males Females Total Pulmonary 54 62 116 N on-Pulmonary 15 8 23 69 70 139 Of these 139, 103 were primary notifications, 31 were transferred from other districts and 5 came to notice in other ways. During the year 95 persons were removed from the register for the following reasons:â€” Recovered 4 Removed from the district 42 Death 49 After allowing for the additions and deductions, the number remaining on the register at the 31st December, 1945, was distributed as shown in the following table:â€” TABLE XIX.

The district provides a free service for the examination of sputum for tubercle bacilli. During the year 52 specimens were examined with a positive result in 2 instances. No action was taken under the Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925, which gives power to prohibit the handling of milk by infectious tuberculous persons, nor under Section 172 of the Public Health Act, 1936, which provides for the removal of an infectious person to hospital. Two Voluntary Care Committees share in the responsibility for maintaining the health of tuberculous persons in this district. The majority of the funds which are raised by these Committees are expended in providing nourishment for patients suffering from this infection. 58 TABLE XXI.

While grateful for this relief, in some other ways conditions had become even more difficult, particularly with regard to staff. The teacher or warden, that pivotal member of the staff on whcse presence the activities of the 2â€”5'ti so largely depends, disappeared from many nurseries and there has been no possibility of filling the gap. When many of us started to run day nurseries we regarded the teacher as something of a luxury rather than a necessity. I do not suppose any of us have any doubt on this point now. Without a teacher the value of a nursery sadly deteriorates and there is a risk of it becoming a mere parking place for children. In considering the question of the continuation of day nurseries there is no doubt that many were influenced by the inevitable deterioration of the standard in the nurseries by this loss of the teachers that has occurred through normal wastage and the inability to obtain fresh recruits. It is a powerful argument for the present need of provision of accommodation for children that so many supported the continuation of the nurseries in such circumstances. If so many of our day nurseries are compelled to continue without a teacher the nursery function needs reconsideration. If one is not prepared to advocate allowances sufficient to obviate the need of certain classes of mother, such as the widow, from working, one cannot deny that nurseries must be provided for these mothers but. without a trained educationist, some modification of the claims that there ,are overpowering advantages in the nursery environment will have to be made. In the past when comparisons have been made between the 60 nusery and the home, emphasis has sometimes been laid on the educational advantage to the child in the nursery. If the quality of this aspect of nursery life is reduced it is more than ever clear that it is our duty to recognise that the nursery is, in certain circumstances, an unavoidable substitute for the home and not a superior institution to which we should encourage mothers to send their children, as providing something especially beneficial which the normal child in a normal home is unlucky enough to miss.
