LTD. 129 High Street Tel 18 2 Urban District Council of Chislehurst and Sidcup HEALTH REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1945. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Health Report for the year 1945, this being the twenty-third one submitted by me as your Medical Officer of Health. The population of the District, as estimated by the Registrar-General at mid-year 1945 was 59,170, as compared with 57,370 last year. A decrease took place in the Birth Rate, this being 17.5 per thousand of population, as against 20 0 last year. The Death Rate also showed a decrease, viz., 101 per thousand of population, as compared with 10.7 last year. The Infantile Mortality Rate was equal to 32 per thousand registered births, as compared with 26 last year and 38 in 1943. This Rate is liable to fluctuations owing to the small numbers involved. During the year 949 Certificates of Notification were received, as against 1,370 last year. These notifications related chiefly to Scabies, Measles, and Scarlet Fever. In submitting this Report it is my desire to thank the Council and all its Officers for the help and assistance I have received. In particular I would like to place on record my appreciation of the loyal and efficient services rendered by all the members of the Public Health Department. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. N. CAVE, Medical Officer of Health. 3 Urban District Council of Chislehurst and Sidcup PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE. Chairman: W. BROWN, Esq., C.C.
