To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Wood Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the year 1950. So far as the general health of the community is concerned, the year may be said to have been uneventful. Infectious disease was rather more prevalent than in the previous year, but the diseases curring were mostly of a mild type, and apart from one death from whooping cough, there were no deaths reported from the commoner infections. For the third year in succession no cases of diphtheria were reported, and for the eleventh year in succession no death occurred from this disease. The Birth Rate fell again from 13.6 in 1949 to 12.8 in 1950, while the Death Rate at 11.9 was the same as for the previous year. The Infantile Mortality Rate was the same as for 1949, namely 25 per 1,000 live births, the lowest rate on record in Wood Green. I wish once again to say how grateful I am to the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their support throughout the year, and to express my appreciation of the excellent work of the staff of the Health Department. Your obedient servant, MALCOLM MANSON, Medical Officer of Health. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE AREA. Area (acres) 1,607.6 Population—Estimate supplied by the Registrar General 52,710 Number of inhabited houses (end of 1950) according to the Rate Books 13,757 Rateable Value, 1950 £539,505 Sum represented by a penny rate £2,225 3 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR. Live Births:— Total M. F. Legitmate Illegitimate 652 25 340 10 312 15 Birth Rate 12.8 per 1,000 Still Births 13 7 6 Rate per 1,000 births 18.8 Deaths 630 296 334 Death Rate 11.9 per 1,000. Deaths from Puerperal Causes — Rate per 1,000 Births Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age:— All Infants 17 Rate per 1,000 Live Births 25.0 Legitimate 16 Rate per 1,000 legitimate Live Births 24.5 Illegitimate 1 Rate per 1,000 illegitimate Live Births 40.0 Deaths from:— Cancer (all ages) 124 Measles (all ages) — Whooping Cough (all ages) 1 Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) 6 Number of Births notified 694 Number of Births Registered in the Borough 198 POPULATION. The mid-year estimate of the population supplied by the Registrar-General is 52,710, a decrease of 70 from that of the previous year. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered during the year was 677, which corresponds to a Birth Rate of 12.8 per 1,000 of population. This is a fall from the number of births in the previous year, which was 719, giving a Birth Rate of 13.6. The number of still-births was 13 and the Still-Birth Rate 18.8 per 1,000 births. In 1949, the Still-Birth Rate was 22. 4 DEATHS. The number of deaths credited to Wood Green after the necessary adjustments had been made for inward and outward transfers was 630. This is only one less than the total number of deaths in 1949, and gives the same Death Rate as that year, 11.9 per 1,000 of population. Of the total of 630 deaths, no fewer than 424 or 67 per cent, occurred at ages over 65. 126 deaths occurred at ages over 80 and 14 at ages over 90. The individual causes of death are given in Table III, in the Appendix to this report, and the principal causes of death for 1950 and the previous year are shown below:— Cause of death. 1950 1949 Heart Disease 210 198 Other Diseases of the Circulatory System 16 28 Intra-cranial Vascular Lesions 75 74 Cancer—all sites 124 121 Tuberculosis—all forms 12 19 Seven deaths occurred from the principal zymotic diseases. Of these one was from whooping cough and six from diarrhoea in children under two years. There were no deaths from enteric fever, smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria or measles. The Zymotic Death Rate was 0.13 per 1,000 of population. INQUESTS. Twenty-three inquests were held on deaths occurring in Wood Green, two of these without post-mortem examination. A further 135 post-mortem examinations were done without an inquest, 83 of these in the Prince of Wales's Hospital which by arrangement with the Wood Green Council has provided mortuary services since the Wood Green Mortuary was closed a few years ago. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of infants under 12 months was 17 and the Infant Mortality Rate, 25 per 1,000 live births. This Rate is the same as that for the previous year, which was the lowest on 5 record in Wood Green. It compares favourably with that for the country as a whole, which was 30 and that for a group of towns of comparable size which was 34. Of the 17 infantile deaths, 11 occurred within 24 hours of birth, and 13 during the first four weeks of life. This gives a Neo-natal Mortality Rate of 19. Of the 11 deaths occurring within 24 hours of birth, 6 were those of premature babies. Three of these were triplets who lived for 9, 10 and 11 hours respectively. The following table shows the causes of death at the various ages under one year. Cause of Death. Under 1 week. 1 to 2 weeks. 2 to 3 weeks. 3 to 4 weeks.

No deaths occurred during the year as a result of childbirth, so that the Maternal Mortality Rate was nil. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Table IV in the Appendix gives details of all the cases of infectious disease notified in 1950. The total of 1,010 is higher than that of the two previous years 1949 and 1948 which were respectively 911 and 762. 421 cases of measles and 376 of whooping cough accounted for more than three-quarters of all the cases. There were no deaths from measles and one from whooping cough. 99 6 cases of scarlet fever were notified, but these were all mild with no deaths. For the third year in succession no case of diphtheria occurred in Wood Green, and for the eleventh year in succession there was no death from this disease. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. During the year, 701 children were immunised for the first time, 548 of these against diphtheria alone, and 153 against diphtheria and whooping cough. Of the total of 701, 168 were immunised by private doctors, and 533 at local clinics and schools. During the same time 1,980 children received reinforcing injections, 14 of them from private doctors, and the remainder at schools or clinics. Immunisation against diphtheria has been carried out regularly in Wood Green since 1929 and the state of immunisation of the child population is fairly satisfactory. Our records show that 65 per cent, of the children under 5 have been immunised, and 92 per cent of the children from 5 to 14 years. Poliomyelitis. Four cases of anterior poliomyelitis were notified during the year, one child and three adults. Two of these were very mild, and complete recovery took place. Of the two others, one, a child, shows slight paralysis of both legs at the end of a year, and the other, an adult, extensive paralysis of both legs, and of the trunk muscles. Very gradual improvement is however still taking place ten months after the onset of illness. Tuberculosis. The number of new cases of tuberculosis coming to the knowledge of the Health Department during the year was 83, 76 pulmonary and 7 non-pulmonary. These included 20 transfers from other districts. The total number of new cases 83, is less by 12 than the number for the previous year. There were 12 deaths from tuberculosis, 8 male and 4 female. Of these one male and one female death were due to non-pulmonary tuberculosis, and all the others to the pulmonary form of the disease. There were 19 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis in 1949 but no deaths from the non-pulmonary form. The death rate from 7 culosis was 0.22 per 1,000 of population, which is an improvement on the rates for 1949 and 1948 which were respectively 0.36 and 0.49. From the information given in Table V it will be seen that as is usually the case, the heaviest incidence of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis was in the age group from fifteen to forty-five, and among females it was particularly high between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five. Food Poisoning. Sixteen cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. In most of the cases the evidence implicating any individual article of food was very indefinite, and bacteriological investigation failed to show any bacterial contamination of food. In nine cases only one member of a household was affected. In one case two members of a household were affected, and in one case no fewer than five members of a household of six were involved. In this last case sudden illness characterised by diarrhoea and vomiting occurred very shortly after a meal, in which all those affected had partaken of canteloupe melon, which had not been eaten by the only member of the household not affected. One of those affected, a visitor to the district, an elderly lady of 69 years, died within 12 hours, but it was known that she had suffered from a heart affection for some years and after a post-mortem examination, death was certified by the Coroner as due to coronary occlusion, accelerated by excessive vomiting' arising from poisoning of unknown origin. The most exhaustive investigation both chemical and bacteriological failed to reveal the actual cause of the poisoning, but none the less this was obviously an outbreak of food poisoning. SCABIES. Only three cases of scabies, one school child and two adults, requiring treatment during 1950 were sent to the Hornsey Cleansing Station. The arrangement with the Hornsey Borough Council for treatment of Wood Green cases was discontinued in November, owing to the shortage of nursing staff to undertake the work. The number dealt with in the previous year was seven. 8 BACTERIOLOGICAL WORK. The majority of all the bacteriological work required for the Borough was carried out at the Public Health Sub-LaboratoTy situated at the Coppetts Wood Isolation Hospital. The specimens examined during the year were as follows:— Positive. Negative. Total Diphtheria — 207 272 Haemolytic Streptococci 65 Vincent's Angina — Faeces 1 24 25 Sputum (for tubercle bacilli) 2 16 18 Pertussis — 3 3 In addition 73 Ice Cream samples were examined, and 24 milk samples. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The number of articles dealt with at the Disinfecting Station was as follows:— Articles disinfected 608 Articles destroyed 210 199 rooms were disinfected on account of infectious disease, and 70 disinfested on account of the presence of vermin. HOUSING. The Borough Surveyor has kindly supplied me with the following figures, showing the number of houses which have been erected or rebuilt during the year. Council Flats completed:— 38 in Vincent Square. 9 in Truro Road. Council Flats in course of construction at end of year. 40 at Bounds Green Court. 18 at "The Hollies." Bounds Green Road. 18 at Vincent Square. 9 Private Enterprise. 14 flats and 14 houses were built by private enterprise and 6 flats were in course of construction at the end of the year. In addition 13 war-destroyed houses were rebuilt during the year providing 15 units of accommodation. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year eighteen medical examinations were carried out on entrants to the Council's employ for acceptance into the Superannuation scheme. WORK OF THE SANITARY INSPECTORS. The following tables give a brief summary of the routine work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. It will be seen that a great part of the inspectors' time is devoted to inspection of dwelling houses, as a result of which a very large number of repairs has been carried out. Much of the house property in Wood Green is old, and suffers from neglect and damage of the war years, aggravated by a shortage of repair materials. Consequently the remedy of defects is at times a slow process, but in the majority of cases the work is done on the service of an informal notice, and only in a minority of cases is it necessary to serve statutory notice requiring the work to be done. Another matter to which the Inspectors have devoted a great deal of attention has been to improving the conditions under which food is prepared and served to the public. This has entailed very considerable demands on the owners or occupiers of food premises for improved equipment and better facilities for washing of utensils and also special provision of hot water and wash-basins for the personal use of food handlers. These requests for improvements have on the whole met with a ready response on the part of the owners or occupiers and frequent visiting of food premises by the sanitary inspectors has been accompanied in the past few years by a very marked improvement in the conditions generally under which food is handled. There is still room however for further improvement but there is evidence that not only the food handler but also the food buyer is becoming very conscious of the importance of a higher standard of cleanliness in these matters than has generally prevailed in the past. 10 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.
