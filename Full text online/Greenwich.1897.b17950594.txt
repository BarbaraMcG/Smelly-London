The above-mentioned notices were, in most cases, complied with, but proceedings were taken against the owners of twentyfive houses (twenty-four in Deptford and one in Greenwich), for neglecting to execute such works and do such things as were necessary for the purpose of abating the nuisances arising upon such premises. Upon the hearing of the summonses in relation to sixteen of these houses, the magistrate made orders, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prohibiting their use for human habitation, and such houses were accordingly closed; and, with regard to thirteen of such houses, the magistrate ordered the owner thereof to pay costs amounting to £8 17s. The proceedings in relation to two houses resulted in the magistrate making orders for the abatement of the nuisances, and the necessary works were carried out, in accordance with such orders. The owners of the remaining seven houses, in consequence of the proceedings taken against them, executed the required works to each of such houses, to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Inspector making the complaint, and the summonses were accordingly withdrawn. Proceedings were also taken against the occupier of a house, and the occupier of a room, in Deptford, and against the occupier of a room in Greenwich, for permitting such house in the one case, and the rooms in the two other, to be so overcrowded as to be injurious or dangerous to the health of the inmates, with the result that, in each case, the magistrate made an order for the abatement of the nuisance, and the nuisances were abated accordingly. 11 Proceedings were also taken against the owner of a house in Greenwich, for neglecting to provide an additional water-closet to and for that house, and he was fined £3, and 7s. costs, and subsequently complied with the Board's requirements in this respect. Proceedings were also taken against the owner of a house in Deptford, for neglecting to provide to and for such house, a sufficient ash-pit, and, upon the hearing of the complaint, it being proved that, since the issue of the summons, he had made the required provision, the magistrate fined him 10s and 2s. costs. Proceedings were also taken against a person for, in newly fixing an apparatus in connection with an existing water-closet to a house in Deptford, not executing such work in compliance with the requirements of the Bye-laws made by the London County Council, under section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which resulted in the apparatus being so amended as to comply with those Bye-laws. Proceedings were also taken against the occupiers of a factory in Deptford, for allowing a chimney at those works to send forth black smoke, in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, and they were fined 20s., and 2s. costs. Proceedings of a similar nature were also taken against the occupiers of a factory in Greenwich, and they were fined £4, and 2s. costs. During the year, 428 newly-erected houses in the district, viz.:—242 in Greenwich and 186 in Deptford, were inspected, for the purpose of ascertaining if they were provided with a proper and sufficient supply of water, and such being found to be the case, the Sanitary Authority granted a certificate to that effect, in respect of each of such houses. 12 During the same period, 1,131 rooms and the following articles were disinfected after cases of infectious disease, namely: 788 beds, 1,647 pillows, 205 bolsters, 131 palliasses, 266 mattresses, 705 sheets, 966 blankets, and 3,047 odd articles, making 7,755 articles in all. It was found necessary during the same period to destroy 12 beds, 25 palliasses, 5 pillows, 8 mattresses, 2 bolsters, 7 cushions, 1 blanket, 1 carpet, and 19 odd articles, making together 80 articles, which had become infected. During the same period a cab, which had carried a person suffering from an infectious disease, was disinfected; and ten class rooms and a corridor at one of the Board Schools in the district were similarly treated, in consequence of their having been an epidemic of measles amongst some of the children attending that School. During the year the premises in East Street, Greenwich, acquired by the Board for the purpose of providing shelter and accommodation for the temporary use of such inhabitants of the district as might be compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, were not once so used. These premises were during that period repaired, repainted and redecorated. During the year the Board registered eight houses in the Parish of Greenwich as Lodging Houses, under the Bye-laws made by the Board, under the provisions of section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. During the year two Underground Public Sanitary Conveniences and Lavatories, which had been constructed for the use of both sexes, namely, one at the northern end of South Street, Greenwich, and one at New Cross Gate, Deptford, were opened; 13 the Board, under the provisions of the 45th section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, letting each of such Conveniences, upon certain conditions, to Mr. George Jennings, of Lambeth Palace Road, London, S.E., for a term of three years. An old and defective Public Urinal at the southern end of Clifton Hill, Deptford, was removed and a new cast-iron circular one, fitted with glazed stoneware urinal basins and marble divisions, and with automatic flushing arrangement, provided in lieu thereof. During the year the land which had been added to the Saint Nicholas, Deptford, Recreation Ground, and which had been properly fenced in and provided with the necessary water closets and a urinal and shelter, was opened to the public. This Ground is fitted with gymnastic apparatus, provided by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, for the use of the children frequenting it. During the year the Board accepted a tender for the execution of the required works in connection with the improvement it had previously determined to effect by widening the footway at the junction of Greenwich Road and South Street, and on the western side of South Street, from Greenwich Road to the southern boundary wall of Queen Elizabeth's College, and these works were proceeded with. During the year the Board determined to carry out an improvement by opening up the northern end of Watson Street, Deptford, and carrying through that street as a public thoroughfare into Douglas Street, and entered into an arrangement with the owner of the property at the southern end of Watson Street for affecting a further improvement by widening a passage connecting Watson Street with Charles Street, and the necessary negotiations 14 for acquiring the two houses known as Nos. 50 and 50a Douglas Street, required for the purpose of carrying out the first mentioned improvement are now in progress. The Board also determined to acquire certain land in Greenwich Marshes for the purposes of the Parish of Greenwich, and the necessary steps are being taken for this purpose. During the year the Board erected, after obtaining permission from the owners of property to do so, four ventilating pipes from the sewers against four houses in the Parish of Greenwich. During the year the Board gave permission to the London County Council to erect two steel ventilating columns, namely, one on the footway on the western side of Church Street, Deptford, in the recess by the Saw Mills, and one on the footway on the eastern side of Erlanger Road, opposite the side entrance to No. 45, in that Road, for the purpose of ventilating the Council's sewers in those streets, upon condition that the open gratings in the roadways of those streets, adjoining where such steel columns would be erected, were effectually closed, and these works were carried out by the Council accordingly. The attention of the London County Council having been called to the nuisance arising from the emanation of sewer gas from the open sewer grating, in connection with the Council's main sewer, in the New Cross Road, by the "Marquis of Granby" P.H., and the Council being requested to do what was necessary for the purpose of abating such nuisance, a communication was received from the Council stating that having obtained permission to erect a ventilating pipe against the wall of No. 233, New Cross Road, they 15 would put the work in hand with the least possible delay, and such ventilating pipe was subsequently erected. During the year the Sanitary Inspectors collected, and the Public Analyst analysed 199 samples, consisting of the following articles, viz.:— Butter 88 Milk 65 Separated Milk 2 Skim Milk 1 Coffee 19 Mustard 10 Pepper 7 Lard 4 Arrowroot 2 Sugar 1 199 Proceedings were taken against the sellers of four samples of butter, one of which was certified to consist entirely of margarine, and the others to be admixed with 92, 77 and 25 per cent, of margarine respectively, and fines were inflicted amounting together to £7. A summons was also issued against the seller of a sample of butter, which was certified to consist entirely of margarine, but the police were unable to serve the summons, as the seller had left the premises where the Inspector made the purchase, and could not be found elsewhere. 16 During the year there were 24 Ordinary and Special Meetings of the Board, and the undermentioned Committees and SubCommittees held meetings as follows:— Finance Committee 24 St. Paul, Deptford, Committee 22 Greenwich Committee 22 St. Nicholas, Deptford, Committee 16 District Committee 4 Works and General Purposes Sub-Committee 33 Saint Paul, Deptford, Sanitary Sub-Committee 24 Greenwich Yard Sub-Committee 24 Greenwich Viewing Sub-Committee 3 Greenwich Quarterly Accounts Sub-Committee 4 Sub-Committee appointed to consider the application made by the Blackheath and Greenwich District Electric Light Company, Limited, for a Provisional Order to supply electricity in the Parish of Greenwich 3 Sub-Committee appointed to consider as to desirability of erecting a Dust Destructor for the Parish of Greenwich 3 Sub-Committee appointed to consider tenders for repairing and painting the street orderly barrows 1 Making a total of 207 meetings during the year. 17 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for GREENWICH. To the Greenwich District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my fifteenth Annual Report, for the 52 weeks ending January 1st, 1898. I have to report that 1,885 Births (938 Males and 947 Females) were registered in the Greenwich District, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 1. The number of Deaths was 1,422 (822 Males and 600 Females) equivalent to an annual rate of 23∙0 per 1,000 persons living (including the Greenwich Union and Infirmary, the Seamen's, Miller and Cottage Hospitals, the Royal Naval College, and Greenwich Hospital Schools, and the outlying Public Institutions), and 11∙9 excluding these Public Institutions, details of which appear in the tabulated form No 2. The number of Deaths from the principal Zymotic class was 144, equivalent to an annual rate of 2∙3 per 1,000 persons living, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 3. B 18 The Births were 1,885, being 463 in excess of the number of Deaths, equivalent to an annual rate of 30∙5 per 1,000 persons living, details of which appear in the tabulated form No. 4. Table No. 5 will show the comparative Death Rate per 1,000 (excluding Hospitals and Schools,) for the past 12 years. Table No. 6 will show the comparative Death Rate per 1,000 from Diseases of a Zymotic type for the last ten years. Table No. 7 will show the Population and Births and Deaths, in Registration Districts, during the 52 weeks of 1897. Table No. 8 will show the number of cases of Infectious Disease reported to me under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the 52 weeks ending 1897. Table No. 9 will show the number of cases of Infectious Disease and Deaths notified to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by the several Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the 52 weeks ending January 1st, 1897. Table No. 10 will show the number of Articles and Rooms disinfected from March 25th, 1897, to March 25th, 1898. Table No. 11 will show the number of articles destroyed during the same period. Table No. 12 will show the number of Houses inspected, with inquiries in connection with Infectious Diseases, from March 25th, 1897, to March 25th, 1898. Table No. 13 will show the work of inspection from March 25th, 1897, to March 25th, 1898. 19 Table No. 14 will show the Improvements effected during the same period. INFLUENZA. I regret to state that Influenza has been present during the greater part of the present year (1897). It would be impossible for me to estimate the number of cases that have occurred (as this disease is not one of those which has to be notified under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891), but from personal knowledge, and from information given to me by the different Medical Practitioners in the town, it would appear to have been most prevalent during the first, second, and third quarters of the year. In all there were twenty-two deaths from Influenza (as a first cause) registered during the year as compared with thirteen in 1896, and in addition a considerable increase in the number of deaths from diseases of the Respiratory and Circulatory organs (viz.: Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Heart failure), which proves there is an influence at work which has the power of making those diseases more fatal than at ordinary times. Reference to Table No. 1 will show the number of deaths from Influenza, and also from diseases of the Respiratory and Circulatory organs. It may be interesting to the Members of the Board to be reminded that the first outbreak of Epidemic Influenza (since 1847) occurred in the latter part of December, 1889, and has occurred from time to time ever since, and it would now appear to have become general. 20 The following account is copied from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary:— "The deaths referred to Influenza during 1897 numbered 617 against 727, 2,117, and 491 in the three preceding years. Although the deaths from Influenza in 1897 exceeded those in 1896 they were fewer than in any other year since 1890, the first year of the Epidemic in London, and were less than half the average annual number in the seven preceding years. The cause of Influenza is yet unknown to us, though the result of bacteriological investigation now being carried on may go far towards elucidating the question. The question as to the mode of spread of Influenza is one that has most important bearings on the cause of the disease. The most striking feature of this fever, and the feature in which it differs from other specific fevers, has ever been the fact that enormous numbers of people (spread over a vast extent of country) may be affected simultaneously. This has been noticed from the earliest records to the latest. Thus, in 1557, the whole population of Spain was attacked on the same day. In 1782, in St. Petersburg, 40,000 persons were seized in a single day. In 1847 it was said to have spread in one day over every part of London, and affected upwards of 500,000 persons. These facts seem to admit only of one explanation that (at least in the early period of an Epidemic) the cause of the disease is carried by the air, and that the primary mode of spread of the disease is through the atmosphere. 21 It is believed by a large majority of medical men that the disease is of an infectious character, and the best means of suppressing it is by isolation." The following figures show the number of deaths that have been registered from Influenza in the Greenwich District since 1890:— 1890 4 1894 11 1891 44 1895 51 1892 33 1896 13 1893 28 1897 22 CHOLERA. I am happy to state that during the year 1897 there was not a case of Cholera reported as having occurred in this district. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. I stated in my Annual Report of 1888-9, that it was customary to regard the absence or prevalence of disease of a Zymotic type as a test of the Sanitary condition of a district, and I was justified in congratulating the Board upon the satisfactory state of the Parish of Greenwich, as the Death Rate amounted to only 1∙6 per 1,000 from that class of disease. This year, the Death Rate amounts to 2∙3 per 1,000 as against 4∙0 of last year. Scarlet Fever. I am glad to state that there has been a considerable decrease in the number of Notifiable Diseases during the year in the Parish of Greenwich, and more particularly so with Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 22 Last year there were 394 cases of Scarlet Fever notified, and 21 deaths, and this year 178 cases and five deaths, three of which occurred in the outlying districts. The following may be of interest:— /###]1893 417 Notified Cases 12 Deaths 1894 270 „ „ 11 „ 1895 256 „ „ 6 „ 1896 394 „ „ 21 „ 1697 178 „ „ 5 „ Enteric or Typhoid Fever. Last year there were 37 cases of Enteric Fever reported, and 16 deaths. This year the number is 35, the fatal cases being eight. Erysipelas still shows a decrease, compared with that of last year. 1893—140 cases. 1894—96. 1895—65. 1896—61. 1897—56. Measles. This disease used to be looked upon as one of the most simple of the Zymotic class, but of late years the complications (principally of the Respiratory organs) arising therefrom have been so numerous as to suggest that it is more fatal than Scarlet Fever. In this district there were 10 deaths from Measles and its complications in 1897, against 57 last year. 1893—27. 1894—38. 1895—25. 1896—57. 1897—10. 23 In the opinion of many Medical Officers of Health, Measles should be reported under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the place of Erysipelas. At the present time, enquiry is being made by the Medical Officer to the London County Council as to the desirability of notification. I believe it to be simply a matter of expense. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. I am happy to state that the notifications received of Diphtheria cases have decreased considerably, in fact, they are lower than in any year since 1892, see Table A, page 26. The deaths from that disease are much smaller in proportion than formerly, the decrease being due, to the best of my belief, to its earlier recognition, and subsequent treatment by means of injection with anti-toxin. The following extract and table is taken from the RegistrarGeneral's Annual Summary for 1897:— "Diphtheria was the assigned cause of 2,261 deaths in the course of the year 1897. These deaths were equal to a rate of 0•51 per 1,000, against rates of 0•62, 0•54, and 0•60 per 1,000 in the three preceding years. "The London Death Rate from Diphtheria in 1897 exceeded the average rate in the ten years 1887-96, which had been 0•45 per 1,000. The deaths from Diphtheria and Croup together numbered 2,333, and were 64 below the average. The local mortality 24 from Diphtheria is very seriously disturbed by the existence of hospitals in certain of the areas. In Hampstead, for example, 176 deaths from Diphtheria were registered in 1897; most of these occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospital, to which the patients had been admitted from other districts, and, after distribution of Institution deaths, only 17 remained which were those of persons belonging to Hampstead sanitary area. Similarly in Fulham sanitary area 155 deaths from Diphtheria were registered, most of these being Hospital cases imported from outside districts, only 63 properly belonging to Fulham. Hackney, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, City of London, Holborn, St. Olave Southwark, Wandsworth, Greenwich and Lee, are also instances of sanitary areas whose registered Death Rates from Diphtheria are enormously increased by the presence of Hospitals. On the other hand, Kensington, Chelsea, St. Marylebone, St. Giles, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, Bethnal Green, St. George-in-the-East, St. George Southwark, Newington, Bermondsey, Battersea and Camberwell, may be mentioned as examples of the opposite kind, where the effect of distribution has been to more than double the Diphtheria Death Rates of those areas by the inclusion of deaths occurring in Hospitals outside their own boundaries. "Among London sanitary areas the lowest Death Rates from Diphtheria, after distribution of Institution deaths, were 0•13 in St. James, Westminster, 0•17 in St. Olave, Southwark, 0•19 in St. Giles, and 0•21 in Strand; the highest rates were 0•65 in Bethnal Green, 0•66 in Camberwell, 0•71 in Poplar, 0•73 in Clerkenwell and in Bermondsey, and 0•80 in Woolwich. "The following table shows the Death Rates from Diphtheria 25 in the London sanitary areas severally during each of the past ten years:— DEATHS from DIPHTHERIA, per 1,000 living, in each of the METROPOLITAN SANITARY AREAS during the Ten Years 1888-97, after distribution of Deaths in Public Institutions.

Notified cases of Diphtheria. Deaths from Diphtheria. 1890 53 1890 26 1891 48 1891 21 1892 43 1892 9 1893 170 1893 51 1894 139 1894 38 1895 215 1895 41 1896 400 1896 59 1897 128 1897 16 In both England and London the mortality from Diphtheria was less in the decade 1871-80, than in 1861-70, but in the decade 1881-90 it was greater than in the second, and in London, had increased to a higher ratio even than in the first decade. Comparing London to England, in the first decade the ratio of mortality was about 5 per cent. lower than that of England, in the second decade about equal, and in the third about 6 per cent. higher. It is strange that whilst formerly it was more prevalent in the rural districts it now appears to affect the urban most. 27 In the Greenwich District most of the cases were confined to young children of school age. Some years ago this disease used to be confined to the eastern part of the Parish, especially in the Marsh district, but this year it has visited every part. I believe that owing to the highly infectious character of this disease, it is largely spread in Schools. Sir Thome Thome (Medical Officer to the Local Government Board), in his Milroy Lectures on Diphtheria in 1891, showed that since 1871, whereas the annual Death Rates from all causes from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, and from Enteric Fever, have been steadily falling in England and Wales, in large towns and in London the annual Death Rates from Diphtheria have been rising slightly in England and Wales, more markedly in the large towns, and most markedly in London. Whilst the mortality of Diphtheria is still steadily rising, that of Enteric Fever is equally steadily falling pari passu with improved sanitation, and the mortality of Scarlet Fever is also falling pari passu with increased Hospital isolation; so that whereas the improvement of sanitation markedly decreases the mortality of Enteric Fever, it appears to have no effect on Diphtheria. To what cause may this increase of Diphtheria be due? Many have been suggested. 1. School influence. 2. Sewer ventilation and unsanitary conditions. 3. Alteration in classification (particularly with regard to Membranous Croup), now being classified with Diphtheria. 4. Connection with other throat affections. 28 School Influence. In 1870 the Elementary Education Act was passed for the establishment of School Boards and Elementary Schools. Now, whereas during the decade 1861-70, the number of deaths from Diphtheria decreased annually, during that of 1871-80 they increased annually. Sir Thome Thome has so fully and so carefully entered into this subject of "School Influence," that his conclusion that increased school attendance has had a material influence in increasing the spread of Diphtheria is irresistible. Although I am of opinion that "School Influence" has been a potent cause in the spread of Diphtheria, I cannot charge "School Influence" with being the sole cause of the great increase that has occurred since the year 1893. I would rather suggest that the great increase is primarily due to one of those peculiar waves that come over us in the form of an epidemic, the cause of which is unknown at the present time. I have no doubt but that in the course of time much useful knowledge on the means of spread will be discovered both by the chemist and the bacteriologist. Whilst such men as Sir William Jenner and Dr. Wilkes on the one side believe that the disease is in the main independent of sanitary conditions or hygienic circumstances, and whilst Sir George Johnson is diametrically opposed to their partickular views, it behoves us to look further afield for the cause. I am inclined to think that our main drainage is faulty. The main drainage system was laid in 1863, and the engineer (the late Sir Joseph Bazalgette) made a statement at 29 the time of its completion that it would last for 25 years, and at the end of that time (with the rapidly increasing population) it would be necessary to inquire closely whether it could not be capable of improvement. ANTI-TOXIC SERUM TREATMENT FOR DIPHTHERIA. It is gratifying to know that the mortality from Diphtheria is much lower since the use of the "Anti-toxic Serum." The deaths from that disease have considerably diminished since its introduction and subsequent application. A very exhaustive report on the subject has been published by the Medical Superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, the summary of which I append :— "The improved results in the Diphtheria cases treated during the year 1896, which are indicated by the foregoing statistics and clinical observations, are— (i.) A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first and second day of illness. (ii.) The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. (iii.) The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. (iv.) The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate Hospital. (v.) The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. 30 "We have had, in fact, somewhat better results to record for 1896 than we had for 1895; and, in view of the extended experience gained during the past year, together with the additional facts concerning the post scarlatinal cases for 1896, we feel that we are fully justified in the favourable opinion we expressed last year on the value of anti-toxin in the treatment of Diphtheria. "We would repeat what we stated last year as to the paramount importance of commencing the treatment early—if possible, not later than the second day of the disease. From this time onward the chance of a successful issue will diminish in proportion to the length of time which has elapsed before the treatment is commenced. This, though true of other methods, is of still greater moment in the case of treatment by anti-toxin. "We have already drawn attention to the trivial nature of the secondary effects that not infrequently arise as a direct result of the injection of anti-toxic serum, and we think that neither these effects nor the increased incidence of some of the usual complications are worthy of being considered practical deterrents when the beneficial results of the treatment are remembered. "We have only to add that we still hold to the opinion that in the anti-toxic serum we possess a remedy of distinctly—we would not say much—greater value in the treatment of Diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted." The Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board state in their Annual Report, 1897, that the same improvement has occurred in the Diphtheria cases treated by anti-toxin. Whooping Cough. Reference to Table No. 3 will show that 19 children died from this disease in the district, benig a 31 decrease of 28 under last year. Whooping Cough is a disease peculiar to young children, and it is difficult to suggest any particular Sanitary measures which, in the absence of isolation, would tend to lessen its spread. Diarrhœa. There were 82 deaths from this disease (including Infantile Diarrhoea), being an increase of 44 over last year, and higher than in any of the last ten years. This disease is particularly fatal amongst young children during the months of July, August, and September, and more especially during the period of Teething. It is accelerated by the administration of improper food. Had it not been for the large increase in the number of deaths from this disease the Zymotic Death Rate of Greenwich would have been 1 per 1,000. Small Pox. One case only of Small Pox was reported to me during 1897, and that occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital. In case of Small Pox occurring I notify every case to the Board of Guardians through their Vaccination Officer. The necessary Sanitary precautions are observed in every case by Inspection, Disinfection, Destruction of Bed, Bedding &c., and the serving of Notices to abate Nuisances. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the following diseases are scheduled :— Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Small Pox, Cholera, Erysipelas; and Puerperal, Typhus, Enteric, and Relapsing Fevers. 32 Under this Act it is compulsory for the Medical Attendant and the householder (in which the case occurs) to notify to the Medical Officer of Health of the District immediately upon the outbreak of any of the above diseases. Reference to Table No. 8 will show the number of cases reported during the year 1897. GENERAL REMARKS. Sewer Ventilators. During the past year I have received complaints from all parts of the Parish respecting the smell that arises from the Sewer Ventilators. I have forwarded these complaints to the Medical Officer of the London County Council. In order to abate the nuisance there should be more ventilators erected, and they should be carried up to a considerable height, instead of being at ground level. In one case this has been done, viz., in the Trafalgar Road, near Christ Church, with considerable benefit to that locality. The following houses have been either closed or demolished during the year, owing to their being unfit for human habitation : Iron Cottage, Black wall Lane Closed on receipt of notices rather than have house repaired. No. 68, Hoskin Street, East Greenwich (an old wooden house) Demolished. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, Skinners Row, Blackheath Road Closed by order of the Magistrate. Ye Olde House, Hyde Vale Closed and repaired afterwards. The Ferns, Hyde Vale, Conduit Vale House, Hyde Vale Closed and demolished by owner's consent. 33 Oak House, East Street. Under Section 60, Subsection 4, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891: "The Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation, with any necessary attendants, for the members of any family, in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority." The above house was purchased by the Hoard for the use of the Greenwich District (which includes the Parish of Deptford), and a caretaker was engaged to take charge. The house has been repaired, cleansed, limewashed, and purified during the year. It is only partly furnished. There have been no admissions coming from infected houses during 1897, either from Greenwich or Deptford. The number of deaths of infants under one year during 1897 was 293. Last year, 1896, there were 283. Ninety-five deaths of persons aged 80 and upwards were registered during the year, being a increase of 23 as compared with that of last year. During the year I visited the Slaughter-houses and Cow-sheds, and found them in a satisfactory condition. The Bakehouses were also inspected, and those that were in an unsanitary condition reported to the Board. I have much pleasure in stating that your Sanitary Inspectors (Messrs. Wilson and Fisher) have been of great assistance to me. They have discharged their onerous duties with zeal, intelligence and success. 34 The appointment of a Sanitary Inspector to carry out the duties in connection with the notification of Infectious Disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, has been of much service, and I have pleasure in stating that Mr. Bache has conducted the work to my entire satisfaction. In conclusion, I desire to thank the members of the Board for their uniform courtesy, and their willingness at all times to assist me by adopting any suggestions that I have made tending to improve the sanitary condition of the district. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, CHARLES HENRY HARTT, Medical Officer of Health. TABLE No. 1. 1897. BIRTHS. DEATHS. AGES AT TIME OF DEATH. CAUSES. M. F. Total. M. F.

The Birth Rate for London during the same period was 30.0, and for the thirty-three great towns 30.7. There were 3,418 births registered in the Parish of Saint Paul (1,747 males and 1,671 females), and 268 in St. Nicholas (122 males and 146 females). 50 DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in Saint Paul's Parish was 1,396, in Saint Nicholas Parish, 143, in the South Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital, 265, and in the outlying public institutions, 498, making a total of 2,302. Of the 265 deaths registered as occurring in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital, only 24 were parishioners of Deptford, therefore, if these deaths, 241, are deducted from the gross number occurring in my district, it makes the number of deaths of parishioners only—including those dying at outlying Public Institutions—2,061, equivalent to an annual Death Rate of 17.6 per 1,000 persons living. The Death Rate in the thirty-three great provincial towns during the year averaged 19.1 per 1,000 persons living. Whilst the Death Rate for the Metropolis was 18.2 per 1,000; that for Saint Paul's, including all parishioners whether dying in or out of the parish, 19'3, and for Saint Nicholas Parish, 25·0. Full details will be found in Tabular Forms Nos. 1 and 2, and Table No. 2 gives the Statistics of the births and deaths in the two parishes during the year, showing the number of Deaths which occurred at the South-Eastern Metropolian Asylum Board's Hospital, including non-parishioners, and at the outlying public institutions. Table No. 3 shows the Death Rate in the two parishes during the last 10 years. Table No. 4 shows the excess of births over deaths in the two parishes of Saint Paul and Saint Nicholas, Deptford. MORTALITY AT GROUPS OF AGES. The 2,302 deaths last year included 1,019 children under five years of age, The deaths of 638 children occurred under one year of age, and 381 deaths were registered between 1 and 5 years ; 51 106 between the ages of 5 and 10; 178 between the ages of 10 and 30 ; 693 of persons between 30 and 70; and 306 were of persons aged upwards of 70. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Infantile mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year of age to births registered was equal to 173 per 1,000, whilst in the Metropolis as a whole, it averaged 159 per 1,000, and in the thirty-three provincial towns it was 189 per 1,000. Out of a total of 2,302 deaths registered in the two parishes during the year, there were no less than 638 infants under one year of age. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The average Death Rate from the principal Zymotic diseases in the two parishes was 2.07, as against 2.58 per 1,000 in London generally, and 3.06 (or the thirty-two provincial towns. The number of deaths from all Zymotic diseases registered as occurring at the houses of the parishioners was 245, as against 379, 282 and 330 for the three previous years. Whilst in the Metropolitan Asylum Board's South-Eastern Hospital, 237 were registered, of these only 24 were parishioners of Deptford. The number of infectious diseases notified under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 1,416, as compared with 1,478 for the previous year. Of the Zymotic diseases Diphtheria and Enteric Fever showed an excess over the previous year, whilst Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Continued Fever, and Puerperal Fever showed a decrease in numbers. A full detailed account of the deaths from all the Zymotic diseases which occurred in the two parishes, as well as in the 52 Hospital, will be found in Tables Nos. 5 & 6, and a full account of the infectious diseases which have been notified during the year in Deptford, will be found in Table No. 7. Table No. 8 gives the analysis of the vital and mortal statistics of thirty-three of the largest English towns during the year 1897, showing among other particulars the statistics of the deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases, and Table No. 9 shows the analysis of the vital and mortal statistics of the sanitary districts of the Metropolis during the year 1897. Small Pox. Only one case was notified, a female, aged 38, residing in Junction Road, and employed in Trothy Road, Bermondsey. She was immediately removed to the Floating Hospital, where she afterwards died. Scarlet Fever. Of this disease 632 cases were notified in my district, as against 759 for the preceding year. Eight deaths were recorded in the district, and 69 in the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital; of these six were parishioners. In the previous year 15 were recorded in the district, and 73 in the hospital. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. There were 473 cases notified during the year, as against 431 and 636 for the two preceding years. Twenty-five deaths occurred in the two parishes, and 123 were registered in the South-Eastern Metropolitan Asylum Board's Hospital; of these 7 were parishioners. In the year 1896 there were 146 deaths in the Hospital, and 44 in the district. Fever. This term includes Typhoid or Enteric, Typhus, Simple or Continued, and ill-defined forms of Fever, to which 11 deaths were attributed in the district during the year ; 36 deaths were registered in the Hospital, of these 3 were parishioners; and 114 cases were notified under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. For the year 1896, 86 cases were reported, whilst 12 deaths were registered in the district, and 30 in the Hospital. 53 Puerperal Fever. During the year there were 10 cases of this disease notified, and 6 deaths were registered: whilst in the previous year 18 cases were reported, and 4 deaths were registered. Measles is not a notifiable disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, therefore it is impossible to ascertain the number of cases which occurred in the district, but the number of deaths registed in the two parishes was only 18, and in the Hospital, 5; whereas for the previous year they were 120 for the two parishes, and 11 in the Hospital. Whooping Cough caused 28 deaths, as against 78, 45 and 78 in the three preceding years. Diarrhœa was the assigned caused of 135 deaths, as against 90 and 67 for the two preceding years. Respiratory Diseases. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Pleurisy; 288 deaths were registered in the district, and 91 as occurring in outlying institutions, or a total of 379 ; for the two previous years they were 410 and 453 respectively. Phthisis or Pulmonary Consumption was the cause of 126 deaths in the district, and 28 in outlying institutions, or a total of 154, as against 161 and 177 for the two preceding years. GENERAL REMARKS. The sanitary work done in the district during the past year has been of a very satisfactory character. From the Return* furnished by the Sanitary Inspectors it will be seen that the number of complaints received was 520, whilst for the previous year it amounted to 903, clearly showing the good results of the work done during the past few years. The number of premises inspected was 3,722, that of re-inspections, calls, service of notices &c., 21,469. * The Return above referred to follows Table No. 11. 54 There were closed nine houses as unfit for habitation, on the Canal Bank, and notices to abate over-crowding were served in 42 cases. The Disinfector had 837 rooms to disinfect, full details will be found in Table No. 10. The temporary shelter or house accommodation which was provided according to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for members of any family who were compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, was not required for use during the year. The Inspectors, acting under instructions, made frequent examinations of articles of food submitted for sale, and in consequence of these inspections, a quantity of articles were voluntarily destroyed by the persons exposing them for sale. Constant supervision was exercised over the manufacture and storage of Ice Cream, with very satisfactory results. Bakehouses have received frequent and careful inspection. They are all well maintained, and in a cleanly condition, both as regards the limewashing of the walls, and the sweeping of the floors, &c. The cowsheds have been regularly inspected and all were found to be kept in a clean condition, and well ventilated. A case of Anthrax was reported on October 4th, as having occurred in a cow-house, and I inspected the premises with the late Mr. Ingersol, the Veterinary Surgeon to the Board of Trade, and prohibited the sale of milk until such time as the Veterinary Surgeon pronounced the remaining cows free from infection, and the premises had been thoroughly disinfected. A daily inspection was made until the 15th, when permission was given for the sale of milk to be resumed. The slaughter-houses were found in good condition. Smoke Nuisances. The different factories in the district have received constant attention, and notices were served to abate the nuisance in several cases. 55 Workshops, factories and laundries have received constant supervision, with the object of preventing overcrowding, and enforcing cleanliness, limewashing, ventilation and sanitary accommodation for the different sexes. Table No. 11 gives the Meteorological Statistics for London for the year 1897. The Sanitary Sub-Committee by their constant and regular attendance at the meetings continue to take the deepest interest in all matters concerning the health of the district, and I am greatly indebted to them for the support they always-accord me. I desire to express my entire satisfaction of the zeal and energy with which the Sanitary Inspectors have discharged their duties during the year. I have the honour to remain, gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY WILLIAM ROBERTS, Medical Officer of Health, Deptford. 2 56 Summary of Vital and Mortal Statistics for 1897.

ENGINEER AND SURVEYOR'S OFFICE, 141, Greenwich Road. 1898. To the Board of Works for the Greenwich. District. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my third Annual Report of works and matters connected with my department for the year ending 25th March, 1898. SEWERS. During the year the following applications with plans and sections of proposed sewers have been submitted to and approved by the Main Drainage Committee of the London County Council, viz. :— Greenwich. St. Paul, Deitford. Milton Road Whitcher Street Ashburnham Road Sanford Street During the year 420 feet of 9" pipe sewer was constructed in Ashburnham Road, and 3 manholes provided for control of same. The old brick barrel sewer in rear of the houses in Ashburnham Road and Grove was abolished, and 715 feet of 9" pipe sewer was laid in at an improved gradient, 8 manholes were constructed so that this length might be under proper control, and a ventilator erected at the summit end to allow the gas to pass away. The following works have been carried out by your flushing staff in reinstating sewers, which, in ordinary cases, should have been executed by the owners of the property concerned, but for recent decisions of the Courts in matters of sewers versus drains.

Hughes' Fields Prince Street In addition to the above, extensive works were carried out in the rear of Nos. 27 to 39, Windmill Lane, and Nos. 3 to 13, Dennett's Road, by the Jobbing Contractor, necessitating the presence of one of the flushing staff during the time the works were in progress. The flushing staff also prepared the ground to receive the New Urinal, Clifton Hill, by pulling down old Urinal and laying foundations and drains to new site. FLUSHING SEWERS. This district contains about 90 miles 1,135 feet of brick and pipe sewers. The brick sewers are cleansed by manual labour, the pipe sewers being cleansed by periodical flushing with water through inlets provided on the banks of the River Thames and Grand Surrey Canal. Where the above means cannot be adopted, water vans are used and dam boards provided, to obtain a sufficient head of water to remove the deposit on the sewer inverts. Where the deposit is of a heavy and glutinous character, dredging has to be resorted to; about 2 miles of pipe sewers have been dredged during the past year. The road gullies, about 3,829 in number, have been periodically emptied and flushed out with diluted carbolic disinfecting liquid, and during the dry summer weather these gullies are flushed about once in every nine days. 76 SEWER VENTILATION. During the past year shafts have been erected against various premises in the district, but in several instances, owing to the owners of the property affected by the open road vents refusing permission to erect vents in lieu thereof, recourse has been had to ventilating tubes erected on the highway. Special mention should be made of the abolition of the road vents opposite the " Marquis of Granby " P.H., New Cross Road, which were for years a source of complaint from the inhabitants and general public using this portion of the main road ; these vents were not closed until I had held many consultations with the legal advisers of the Trustees of the Simpson Estate, and the matter had been favourably reported upon by their Surveyor, after which I was able to furnish the London County Council's Engineer with the sanction to the erection of a 12" x 6" shaft at 333, New Cross Road, and the vents were, it is to be hoped, sealed for ever. The following vents have been so dealt with during the year, viz. :— Sewer Vents. Sewer Tubes on Highways. Dennett's Road Church Street, Deptford New Cross Road Erlanger Road 117, Greenwich Road Lower Road, 6" x 8" LOCAL SEWERS. I am negociating with other owners, and hope to obtain 77 their consent for the erection of vent-pipes over local sewers; meanwhile, the following sewers have been so treated : Greenwich. Deptford. Charlotte Street Woodpecker Road Claremont Street Armada Street Lower East Street Frenche's Fields Chester Street New Cross Road Pelton Road Kender Street Thornham Street North Road Pearson Street DRAINAGE. Notices and plans have been received for the building and drainage of various premises in the district, and have been submitted to and approved of by the Board. Every drain, where practicable, is now tested with smoke or water, in the presence of the Inspector. This work involves a large amount of labour, and absorbs a great deal of the time of your staff; especially so has this been the case during the past year, for, in addition to the ordinary building operations, two vast estates, one at Deptford Park, and one at Ivy Farm, Greenwich, were opened, and are being rapidly developed. Every endeavour is made to meet the convenience of builders and to facilitate the execution of the work. During the year 118 new connections have been made with the Board's sewers and those of the London County Council, entailing a cost to the applicants of about £550. 78 No less than 29 new gullies have been constructed in various parts of the district during the past twelve months, and their outlets connected with the sewers in the roads where the works were carried out. RIVER WALLS AND DOCKS. The following works were carried out on the River Wall during last autumn, on that portion extending from a point from the Seed Mills to the Wood Paving Company's premises and the long batter on the north side of Horseshoe point, in front of the Linoleum Works 310 feet westwards. A dwarf concrete wall, 2' 6" deep and 2' wide, runs along the above lengths at the foot of the stone rubble batters, for which 94 yards cube of concrete were used, 863 yards super of the rubble stone batter raised and relaid on clay backing, and 2,515 yards super grouted in with fine Portland cement concrete, at a cost, for materials, labour and plant, of £319 lis 6d. CONVENIENCES. The construction of the Underground Convenience situate at the junction of South Street and Greenwich Road was completed and opened in May, 1897. The cost of erection amounted to £2,099 18s. l1d. An Underground Convenience was also constructed at New Cross Gate, which was completed and opened in August, 1897. The cost of this construction was £2,274 16s. lOd. I may be allowed to state that these Conveniences have filled a long felt public want in these neighbourhoods., and have been the means of remedying to a great extent the evils complained of so bitterly by the residents in the immediate locality. 79 These Conveniences have been let to Mr. George Jennings, of Lambeth, who provides the necessary attendance and cleaning materials, the Board paying for gas and water supplied. I am not in a position to state whether these Conveniences are a financial success, but I learn that they are being more used than when first opened, both in the men's and women's departments, especially on Sundays and holidays. Clifton Hill. The old slate and iron Urinal has also been removed, and a new ornamental structure fitted up with glazed stoneware stalls, and marble divisions, with automatic flushing arrangements (the first of its kind, I believe, in London), at a cost of £217 15s. 7d., including the cost of alterations to drains, water service and paving. This erection is a great improvement from a sanitary point of view, and I am glad to say the public, apparently, appreciate the alteration, and I may state that the partitions and stalls have not in any way been defaced, as was the custom with the old slate Urinal. The Wall Urinals at King William Street, Park Row, and Vanbrugh Hill, have been fitted with automatic flushing tanks, new sparge pipes and distributors, and gullies fitted with an overflow outlet to prevent flooding by the accumulation of light refuse on the horizontal gully grate. This work cost the sum of £28 3s. RECREATION GROUND. The addition to St. Nicholas Recreation Ground was opened on the 1st November, 1897, by the Chairman of St. Nicholas Parish Committee, Mr. A. Golding, and among those present 80 were the Earl of Meath, Chairman and Hon. Treasurer of the Metropolitan Gardens Association, and Basil Holmes, Esq., the Secretary of that Association. This work cost the sum of £1,736 13s. 4d., but does not include the cost of providing and fixing the gymnastic apparatus, which was defrayed by the above Association GENERALLY. Board's Offices. In addition to the Clerical Work of this Department, surveys and plans for apportionment of the expenses of forming and paving works have been prepared for the following roads and streets:— Craigerne Road North Road Marlton Street Dollings Place Musgrove Road Copies of these plans were also supplied to your Clerk's and Road Surveyor's Departments for Contract and other purposes. Numerous plans and surveys have also been prepared for street improvements, new roads and sewers. In addition to the foregoing I append tabulated statements of various matters dealt with by the Department during the past year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST J.
