DAVIS (Assistant to Disinfector.) A. NEWMAN (Commenced duties 23rd January, 1961) (Rodent operative) 7 To the Chairman and Members of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Rightly or wrongly 1 have conceived the idea that a letter such as this should attempt to highlight some of the more important features of the local health—features which it must be admitted are often characteristic of national trends also. Towards the end of the year under review, that most dreaded of infectious diseases —Smallpox—was imported into this country, and continued to be a health hazard well on into 1962. The nearest case was in an adjoining local authority's area, and public alarm was indicated by the demand for vaccination which was a great embarrassment to many general practitioners who were already fully engaged in dealing with the ailments which are prevalent in the winter months. Although it would be impossible to keep the population of Chislehurst and Sidcup permanently immune to Smallpox, the outbreak did tend to underline the importance of infant vaccination which one hopes will in future be done in many more cases than has been the practice in recent years. A number of contacts of the disease came under surveillance and several suspected cases were seen, but fortunately no confirmed case occurred in the district. Infectious disease as a whole had a bad time during 1961, with the sole exception of measles, but this should only spur us on to the effort needed to eliminate once and for all two of the more alarming illnesses. I am referring to diphtheria and anterior poliomyelitis which although not affecting this district still cause death and invalidism which could be avoided nearly always by proper attention to the prophylactic measures now available. In the case of anterior poliomyelitis the vaccine can now be taken by mouth, and the procedure is so simple, safe and without inconvenience, that it is amazing that all persons under the age of 40 do not take advantage of this very straightforward procedure. Smoking is a subject upon which I have touched with some vehemence on a number of occasions, but no apology should be needed for stressing yet again the appalling risks of serious ill-health to which the heavy smoker particularly of cigarettes exposes him or herself so heedlessly. During the past year, 33 local residents lost their lives to lung cancer, and for the whole country the figure exceeded 25,000. In addition to this there was an enormous morbidity and mortality from bronchitis and other diseases where smoking at least is very much under suspicion as a contributory factor. If we now turn our attention to the vital statistics, the birth rate shows little variation from the previous year, but it is still 8 well below the national figure. The infant mortality rate approximates very closely to the figure for the country as a whole and there were no maternal deaths. When we come to deaths in general, we note a continuing laudable reluctance to die on the part of the local citizens, the death rate remaining below that for England and Wales once again. The year under consideration was one in which a census was taken, but at the moment the more detailed figures which will eventually be forthcoming have not yet been published. We have for many years had a satisfactory water supply and our food, although there is still room for improvement, is gradually being produced and handled more hygienically, but so far little has been done to improve the purity of the air we breathe. Clean Air is undoubtedly a matter very dear to the hearts of all those in the Public Health Service, and it is indeed good to know that the first survey to be undertaken with regard to smoke control areas is now under way, and is merely the precursor to other surveys to be conducted in the future years with the object of eventually making the whole area smoke controlled. During the year the Government made known its intentions with regard to the future of local government in the Greater Lqdon Area As far as the Public Health Committee is concerned,She decisions mean that in combination with three other local authorities this Council's Members would administer almost all the Health Services both personal and environmental. The exact alignment of the local authorities concerned had not been finally decided at the time of writing, but in view of the Government's declared policy, it is interesting to quote some words writen by my predecessor. Dr. K. E. Tapper, in a report to another authority in 1950 "The day must come when local incentive and local interest will require truly local government. With development of new estates, shops, houses, and transport, the boundaries of local authorities are no longer defined, and amalgamation of authorities is a natural sequence. Large enough to be financially sound and small enough so that the administrator, the elected representative and the electorate, are members of a team and can excercise their functions without reference to forms and form-filling." In compiling a report such as this, one is conscious of the great assistance rendered by other persons, and it does afford me great pleasure to thank Mr. Kermode. the Chief Public Health Inspector, for his very major part in the production of this effort. I should also like to thank him and the other members of the staff for their sustained efforts throughout the year. In his quiet but none the less highly efficient manner, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kelynack, ha9 been a most invaluable asset to both the Department and myself, and I am deeply grateful to him. The 9 meetings of the Public Health Committee have been very pleasant occasions for me and the interest shown by the Chairman and Members in matters affecting local health has been a source of great satisfaction for which I should like to thank them most sincerely. The fact that my thanks to the Members come last is a matter of tradition and is please to be interpreted as "last but not least". I am, Your obedient Servant, H. B. C.

The Registrar General's estimate of the total population of the Urban District, mid-year 1961, was 87,480 which is a reduction of 2,270 on the estimate for the previous year. This reduction is undoubtedly due to the figures obtained from the Census which was taken in the early part of 1961. The population figure gives a density of 9.8 persons to the acre. 14 The natural increase of population, measured by excess of births over deaths, was 492. The 1961 Census figures give a population of 86,907 persons, of which number 41,870 were males and 45,037 females. The intercensal increase (1951-1961) was 3,057 persons or 3.6% increase in population. BIRTHS. 1,286 live births appertaining to the Urban District were registered during 1961, of which 641 were males, and 645 females. There were 1,239 legitimate and 47 illegitimate births. The crude birth rate for the Urban District was 14.7 per 1,000 total population. The rate for England and Wales as a whole was 17.4. The illegitimate birth rate was 36.6 per 1,000 live and still births. There were 47 illegitimate live births, of which 22 were males and 25 females. 24 stillbirths were registered, giving a rate of 0.27 per 1.000 total population and 18.3 per 1,000 live and still births. 12 of the stillbirths were males anrl 12 females The rate for England and Wales was 18.7 per 1,000 total births. Details of the births in the area during the past ten years are given below:— NUMBER OF LIVE BIRTHS NUMBER OF STILLBIRTHS Year Legitimate Illegitimate Total Legitimate Illegitimate Total Total births 1952 1,237 45 1,282 33 — 33 1,315 1953 1,239 52 1,291 28 1 29 1,320 1954 1,276 41 1,317 28 2 30 1,347 1955 1,325 45 1,370 17 — 17 1,387 1956 1,200 44 1,244 30 — 30 1,274 1957 1,192 35 1,227 14 9 23 1,250 1958 1,288 54 1,342 25 2 27 1,369 1959 1,220 51 1,271 21 2 23 1,294 1960 1,276 51 1,327 30 1 31 1,358 1961 1,239 47 1,286 23 1 24 1,310 It will be seen from the above figures that vearlv the number of births has remained at a steady level throughout the ten year period. INFANT MORTALITY There were 28 deaths of infants under one year of age in the Urban District during 1961. as compared with 23 in the previous vear. The table which follows gives the Chislehurst and Sidcup mortality rate for legitimate and illegitimate infants, as well as for all infants, and also shows the comparison between the infant mortality rate in the Urban District and that of England and Wales during the past 10 years. 15 Year Legitimate Infants Rate per 1,000 live legitimate births Illegitimate Infants Rate per 1,000 live illegitimate births All Infants Rate per 1,000 live births Chislehurst & Sidcup England Sl Wales 1952 19.5 Nil 19.5 27.6 1953 23.4 38.5 24.0 26.8 1954 18.8 Nil 18.2 25.5 1955 24.2 44.4 24.8 24.9 1956 22.5 68.18 24.12 23.8 1957 16.8 Nil 16.3 23.0 1958 19.4 55.6 20.9 22.5 1959 19.67 19.6 19.7 22.0 1960 18.0 Nil 17.3 21.7 1961 21.8 21.3 21.8 21.4 Causes of Infant Deaths, 1961:— Causes of Death Under 1 week 1 and Under 2 weeks 2 and under 3 weeks 3 and under 4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 1 month and under 3 months 3 months and under 6 months 6 months and under 9 months 9 months and under 12 months Total deaths under 1 year Acute Bronchitis - - - - - 1 - - 1 2 Broncho-Pneumonia — 2 — — 2 1 2 — - 5 Congenital Heart Disease 2 — — - 2 1 — — - 3 Prematurity 7 - - - 7 - - - - 7 Other Causes 6 3 — - 9 - 1 - 1 11 TOTALS 15 5 — - 20 3 3 - 2 28 Analysis of the Causes of Infant Deaths, 1952-1961:— Under 1 week 1 week and under 2 weeks 2 weeks and under 3 weeks 3 weeks and under 4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 1 month and under 3 months 3 months and under 6 months 6 months and under 9 months 9 months and under 12 months Total under 1 year Atelectasis 22 1 23 — — - — 23 Cerebral Hæmorrhage 6 - - - - - - - - 6 Congenital Heart Disease 9 — — — 9 3 2 1 1 16 Gastro Enteritis — — — — — — — 2 2 4 Malformation 4 2 1 — 7 — — 1 — 8 Meningitis — — — — — — — 1 — 1 Prematurity 69 6 1 — 76 — — — — 76 Respiratory Diseases 9 6 2 — 17 21 8 5 8 59 Other Causes 37 6 1 3 47 6 8 4 10 75 TOTALS 156 21 5 3 185 30 18 14 21 268 16 MATERNAL MORTALITY There were no maternal deaths in the Urban District during 1961. The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales for the year was 0.33 per 1,000 (live and still births). Four maternal deaths have occurred in the area during the 10 year period 1952-1961. Two of these deaths occurred in 1952, one in 1955 and the other during 1960. DEATHS. 794 deaths appertaining to the Urban District were registered during the year, giving a death rate of 9.1 per 1,000 total population. The adjusted rate for use when comparing one area with another is 11.7. The rate for England and Wales as a whole was 12.0. Of the Chislehurst and Sidcup deaths registered, 401 were males and 393 females. The following statement shows the number of deaths and rates per 1,000 total population for the past ten years:— Number of deaths Death rate per 1,000 total population Year Males Females Total 1952 376 363 739 8.7 1953 382 350 732 8.6 1954 364 314 678 7.9 1955 399 348 747 8.6 1956 362 313 675 7.7 1957 365 368 733 8.3 1958 402 354 756 8.5 1959 389 373 762 8.6 1960 334 368 702 7.8 1961 401 393 794 9.1 The following is an analysis of the ages at death for the year 1961:— Male Female 28 were under one year of age 14 14 4 were one and under 5 years of age 4 — 1 was 5 and under 15 years of age 1 — 13 were 15 and under 25 years of age 8 5 19 were 25 and under 45 years of age 10 9 212 were 45 and under 65 years of age 126 86 183 were 65 and under 75 years of age 104 79 334 were 75 years of age and over 134 200 401 393 Full details of the causes of death will be found in Table II in the appendix to this report, but the following table, giving details of certain causes of death in the Urban District during the past ten years, may prove of interest:— 17  1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Cancer of the lung, Bronchus 21 38 36 44 31 34 41 42 34 33 Cancer (all sites) 127 154 149 157 127 151 156 179 140 154 Respiratory Diseases (non T.B.) 72 80 73 87 88 99 96 103 70 95 Tuberculosis 22 20 14 7 11 8 10 6 4 6 Heart and Circulatory diseases 377 325 320 353 329 348 356 367 372 415 Infectious Diseases 4 3 2 2 2 — 1 3 — 2 Road Traffic accidents 4 9 5 5 8 8 8 12 9 11 Other violent causes 10 7 9 10 11 13 13 16 17 20 MORBIDITY STATISTICS The following is a summary of the weekly details received from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance during 1961:— Four weeks ending Number of First Certificates of incapacity received. 24th January 1,253 21st February 1,730 21st March 919 18th April 692 16th May 707 13th June 604 11th July 557 8 th August 485 5th September 527 3rd October 641 31st October 945 28th November 970 26th December 937 The sickness rate followed the usual trend, namely, the highest incidence of illness occurred during the early and late part of the year with the lowest figures being recorded in August. STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS 76 members, or potential members of the staff were given a medical examination during 1961. UNEMPLOYMENT. The Manager of the Local Employment Exchange informs me that during 1961, unemployment locally has been very small, and with a few odd exceptions there has been work for all except the over 60's. 18 OPEN AIR RECREATIONAL AMENITIES.

This "garden city" development merges into the extensive woodlands of Chislehurst and St. Paul's Cray Common, and into the orchards and farm land of the Metropolitan Green Belt. Some woodland is protected by the National Trust and private open spaces, mainly used as sports ground by associations based in London, also occupy a signficant proportion of the area. In addition, the Council's allotments serve as a "lung" and there is provided for the specific enjoyment of residents and others, more than 500 acres of open space scattered throughout the district. On this land are football and cricket pitches, facilities for most organised games, playing spaces for children and others, together with some of the finest park land and gardens around London. Games Wardens continue to be employed in three parks in the season, and form a popular feature. There have not been any notable works of construction in parks during the year. SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. 22 SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. DISINFECTION In the mid 1930s when the common infections, such as diphtheria and scarlet fever were prevalent and of a severe type, medical opinion insisted on careful disinfection of rooms and bedding, following the removal of the sufferers to Isolation Hospitals. Thus in 1936, no fewer than 1,054 rooms and other articles were sprayed, and 1,474 articles were steam disinfected. 25 years later the respective totals were 43 and 290. The methods of disinfection however, have not changed. Rooms are still sprayed with a formalin solution and articles such as Public Library books are treated in a formalin chamber. Blankets, pillows and the like, are subject to steam under pressure at the Disinfecting Station at the Main Road, Sidcup Depot. It is no longer possible to subject the majority of mattresses to this process, as the modern springing will not stand such treatment. In case of such diseases as Smallpox, it would still be necessary to subject premises and articles to the most vigorous of treatment. Details of work carried out in 1961 are given below DISINFECTIONS. Premises visited 154 Rooms disinfected 7 Articles disinfected 326 Steam Sprayed Disinfected Destroyed Rooms 7 — — Mattresses — 2 5 Pillows — 278 4 Bedclothes, batches of — 8 — Clothing, batches of — 2 — Library books 36 — PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. Public Conveniences provided in the district fall into two groups. Those separate from Parks are cleaned and maintained by staff attached to the Public Health Department. They are:— Male and Female Sections: — Westwood Lane, Blackfen. St. Johns Road, Sidcup. Queens Head P.H., Chislehurst. Adj. Tigers Head P.H., Chislehurst. Cotmandene Crescent, St. Paul's Cray. Dorset Road, Mottingham. 23 A large group of conveniences are provided principally for the use of persons enjoying the parks, but in several cases they adjoin the highway and are available for passers by. A full list is given below:— Willersley Park, Blackfen. Penhill Park, Blackfen. The Glade, Lamorbey. Waring Park, Sidcup (2) King George's Field, Sidcup. Longlands Recreation Ground, Sidcup. Recreation Ground, St. Paul's Cray. West Chislehurst Sports Ground, Chislehurst. Recreation Ground, Mottingham. Mottingham Sports Ground. Sidcup Place. Sidcup. Conveniences in parks are also the responsibility of the Public Health Department but the men's sections are cleansed by the staff of the particular Park in which they are situated. The Department cleansing staff consists of four men and eight women. Of these one man and three women (one acting as a relief cleaner) are itinerant. They pay two visits each day to the 15 premises concerned, and more where necessary. The remaining staff act as attendants at the two conveniences where hot water facilities are available. The times during which these latter premises are manned have been altered. At Westwood Lane the total number of hours per day remains the same, whilst at Cotmandene Crescent, St. Paul's Cray, the number of hours was reduced and it was decided that this convenience should remain closed on Sunday. These revised arrangements have functioned satisfactorily. The contract for the new convenience in the car park at St. Johns Road, Sidcup, was let and the building is in course of erection. The old convenience on a nearby site will be demolished. When the new building, which has all modern facilities is completed, attendants will be employed. The Public Health Committee gave consideration to the provision of further conveniences in the district and investigated sites at Mottingham and in the vicinity of Sidcup Railway Station. It is regrettable to have to report that malicious damage suffered by the conveniences is virtually continuous. Most of this is of a minor nature, but in one or two instances, the public have been deprived of the facilities, until repairs could be effected. 105 instances of damage were dealt with at a cost of £234 to the ratepayers. The conveniences suffering the greatest amount of damage were those at Dorset Road Mottingham (15 occasions), Sidcup Place 24 (14), and Mottingham Recreation Ground (10). At the other end of the scale only one item was reported from Cotmandene Crescent, St. Paul's Cray. LABORATORY SERVICE. The marked lessening in the incidence of dysentoy, food poisoning and other intestinal .infections has reduced the number of specimens from patients and of suspected food stuffs, sent for bacterial examiation. Routine specimens are submitted to the Public Health Laboratory at Maidstone, except when cases involve patients in local hospitals, or contacts of such patients when it is preferable to have the examination carried out in the pathological laboratories attached to the hospitals concerned. In this connection I am particularly indebted to Dr. Herman, Consultant Pathologist at Queen Mary's Hospital, for the assistance rendered. The following table indicates the specimens examined:— Food Faeces Vomit No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive No. sent No. Positive Maidstone Public Health Laboratory - - 42 5 - - Queen Mary's Hospital — — 68 10 — — Hither Green Hospital — — 2 1 — — Totals - - 112 16 - - NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Removal of Persons living in Insanitary Conditions. Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, enables the local authority to arrange, in certain circumstances, for the compulsory removal of aged or infirm persons who are in need of care and attention, and unable to provide for themselves. Only two such cases came to notice in 1961. In one of these the welfare services of the County Council were able to assist. In the other case, it was necessary to obtain a Magistrate's Order before it was possible to persuade an elderly lady, living alone, to move to accommodation in an Old Persons' Home. 25 Burial of the Dead. The National Assistance Act, 1948, also places upon Local Authorities the duty of providing for the interment or cremation of bodies when no other arrangements are being made. There is now only a small percentage of the population not covered by "Death Grants" which enable funeral expenses to be met. A few applications for burial were received, usually in respect of persons living alone and with no known relations. Enquiries in these cases are often extensive, but in only one of those investigated in 1961. was it necessary to register the death and to proceed with the interment. NURSING HOMES. There was no change in the number of registered Nursing Homes during 1961. The Homes were inspected at frequent intervals during the year, but at no time were any contraventions found which called for action on the part of the local authority. In the main, the beds are occupied by aged sick or aged infirm patients. Details of the Homes on the register at 31st December, 1961, are as under:— Address Number of Beds. "Fallowlield," Ashfield Lane, Chislehurst 40 "Glenthorne," 24, Lower Camden, Chislehurst 12 "Hatherley," 12, Hatherley Road, Sidcup 9 "Redhill House,'' Redhill, Chislehurst 7 "The Retreat," Lower Camden, Chislehurst 4 PUBLIC MORTUARY. Work connected with the reception of bodies into the Mortuary after sudden death from street accidents or from hospitals, etc. accounts for a considerable and increasing proportion of the Disinfector's time. Bodies must be prepared, firstly for post mortem by a pathologist, and subsequently for the undertakers. Much of this work is of an urgent nature and priority has to be given to it. The Mortuary, which has refrigerated accommodation for six bodies, together with the Coroner's room, where formal inquests are held, is situated at the Council's depot at Beaverwood Road, Chislehurst. During the year, 215 bodies passed through the Mortuary (182 in 1960 and 138 in 1959). Of these 102 arrived from hospitals and 20 inquests took place. 26 HOSPITAL SERVICES. The following hospitals are within the area of the Sidcup Hospital Management Committee of the South-East Metropolitan Region, and I am indebted to the Secretary of the Committee for the information given below. Cray Valley Hospital. Provides a general hospital service with the following beds Maternity 10 Medical 10 Surgical 11 "Section 5" 1 Unclassified 3 Sidcup Cottage Hospital.

The Control of Infection Committee, on which I am represented, continued to function. Voluntary organisations 27 including the British Red Cross Society, the Women's Voluntary Service and the Friends of the Sidcup Hospitals continue to work for all local hospitals. The planning of Phase 1 of the new hospital building, which is for resident accommodation, is proceeding and is it hoped that building will commence during 1962. It is interesting to note that Dr. J. C. Brocklehurst has been appointed Consultant Geriatrician to the Sidcup, Orpington and Bromley Groups. A Geriatric Service has now been provided for the area, with the admission wards at Farnborough Hospital, the short-term active treatment unit at the Lennard Hospitals, Bromley, and long-stay beds at Orpington and Queen Mary's Hospitals. Grove Park Hospital. This hospital comes within the purview of the Lewisham Group Hospital Management Committee, and has only five blocks comprising 292 beds, which come within the Urban District boundaries. 213 of these are used for Tuberculous patients, whilst the other 79 are reserved for non-tuberculous thoracic cases. Venereal Diseases. Patients are referred to the various hospitals with specialist clinics for dealing with these diseases. None of these clinics is situate within the Urban District. COUNTY COUNCIL SERVICES. Ambulance Service. The main depot for the area is at 12 Hayes Lane, Bromley. At the present time there are 25 ambulances and 24 sitting case cars available for use at this depot and the majority of these vehicles are radio controlled. There is also a sub-depot at Main Road, Sidcup. Chiropody Service This is provided for Old Age Pensioners, Handicapped Persons and Expectant Mothers. The clinic is held at the Health Centre, Mickleham Road, St. Paul's Cray, and domiciliary visits are also arranged for housebound patients. Domestic Help Service. Applications for this service should be made to the District Organiser, 69 Sidcup Hill, Sidcup, Kent. (Footscray 5521/2.) 28 The following is a summary of the cases in which assistance was given during 1961:— Maternity (Expectant Mothers) 121 Tuberculosis 2 Aged 589 Others 228 940 Family Help Service Eighteen cases received assistance during the year.

SERVICES RENDERED BY VOLUNTARY AGENCIES. British Red Cross Society. The local (Chislehurst and Sidcup) Divisions under their Director, Mrs. P. Hibbs, and with Mrs. E. M. Watling as Divisional Secretary, has Headquarters at Hornbrook House, High Street, Chislehurst, and it is there that the Medical Loan Scheme and most of the other services are located. The Good Samaritan Club, for disabled men and women, meets on the second and fourth Friday in each month from 2.30-4.30 p.m. Handicraft classes for the disabled take place from 10 a.m.12 noon on Tuesday, and there is a Foot Clinic for old age pensioners on Thursday from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Additionally, there is a Handicraft Class for disabled at the Clinic, Mickleham Road, St. Paul's Cray, on Wednesday 10 a.m.12 noon. Escorts are arranged from Hospitals to Convalescent Homes, welfare visits are paid to hospital patients and "Ministry of Pension Widows" are visited in their own homes. Lectures in First Aid, Nursing and Mothercraft, are arranged for members of the Society. The St. John Ambulance Brigade. The 97th Sidcup Nursing Division functions within the Urban District under the Divisional Superintendent, Mrs. O. Barton, and the Divisional Secretary is Miss H. R. Haley. Personnel with First Aid qualifications, attend the local cinema and many other public gatherings, including meetings and outings of The Old Age Pensioners Association and Rest-A-While Club. First Aid is rendered in case of road accidents, by members stationed at the Road Hut on the Sidcup By-Pass, in the Longlands area, during the summer months. The Division helps in the wards at Queen Mary's Hospital and Sidcup Cottage Hospital, when required. It also assists the District 32 Nurse with some of the long term patients, and at the Cheshire Foundation Home in Bromley. Through the Division's Medical Comforts Fund, invalid chairs, rubber sheeting, etc., may be hired for a nominal fee. Applications for these may be made at the Drill Hall. Halfway Street, Sidcup, on Tuesday, at 8-10 p.m. and at other times, by telephoning Mrs. Bartholomew at FOOtscray 2106. Women's Voluntary Service. This report has been furnished by the Metropolitan Kent County Office. The W.V.S. Centre Organiser is a member of the Old People's Welfare Committee. Darby and Joan Club. The "Home from Home" Darby and Joan Club is still increasing its membership. They meet once a week at the Holy Redeemer Church Hall, Days Lane. General Welfare Work. The members attached to the Centre frequently escort old people to and from Hospital and also visit them in their homes. The Trolley Shop and assistance given in the Out-Patients' Department at Cray Valley Hospital means that a large rota of members has to be maintained. Meals on Wheels. We are still unable to find suitable premises for cooking and have therefore been unable to start this service. However, another effort is to be made this year. CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE. The following is a brief summary of the work carried out by the Committee:— About 800 members attend one or more of the twelve clubs for the elderly which are in operation throughout the district. "Redlac," Station Road, Sidcup. Due to the increased frailty of the residents and the difficulty of carrying coal and cleaning grates, it was decided to launch an appeal for funds for the installation of central heating. A contract for this work has been placed and the work commenced in March 1962. Boarding-Out of the Elderly. This scheme which originally started in the Urban District, is now working well throughout the whole of Metropolitan Kent. During the past year, 66 new cases have been found homes and 32 additional placings have been made. The total number of persons boarded out in Sidcup since the commencement of the scheme is 47, 24 of whom were from outside Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban 33 District. In addition, 23 Sidcup people have been placed in accommodation in other Boroughs and Urban Districts. Friendly Visiting. The panel of visitors has continued the good work of visiting lonely or home-bound elderly people. SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 36 SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1956. Under the above Act, Local Authorities have the duty of enforcing provisions concerning sanitary accommodation for employees, on agricultural holdings. During the year 34 visits were paid to the 28 premises which come within this category. It was not necessary to take action in any instance. CESSPOOLS. In 1954 the Council decided that sewers should be constructed to provide main drainage for premises on cesspools, where outfalls were reasonably available. During 1961, sewers were laid in the streets off Leesons Hill, St. Paul's Cray, and this resulted in the abolition of 59 cesspools. Elsewhere, the use of two other pools ceased. On the other hand, six new cesspools were constructed for premises too far distant from sewers to make connection possible. A small scheme, to be carried out in 1962, will provide sewerage for a few houses in the Bunkers Hill area of North Cray, and this very largely, will conclude this phase of the Council's plan. In 1954, there were 473 premises not connected to main drainage. By the end of 1961, this had been reduced to 227, and allowing for the fact that in some instances properties are drained in combination, the number of cesspools stood at 148. The position at that time was: Premises. Cesspools. Lamorbey and Blackfen 4 4 Sidcup and Footscray 6 4 North Cray 127 84 St. Paul's Cray 73 43 Chislehurst and Mottingham 17 13 Cesspool Emptying The reduction in the number of cesspools has been accompanied by a progressive decrease in the total work undertaken by the Council's gully emptying service. This is available to owners of premises with cesspool drainage, at a charge of 7/6d. per load for dwelling houses and 15/- per load for commercial premises. 37 A review of the operation of the service is being made to see if it can be used more economically.

The number of loads of effluent removed as between the two years given above, is affected by the change from a 600 gallon emptier to one dealing with 800 gallons during the year 1960. DISEASES OF ANIMALS (WASTE FOODS) ORDER, 1957. The work of licencing and controlling plants for boiling waste food has been delegated by the Kent County Council. It is principally designed to prevent disease in animals fed on swill. Plants at five premises are licensed and 49 visits were paid to ensure that operation was satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that new lengths of sewer have been completed, or adopted in private estate development as follow:— Foul Sewers of 6", 9", 12" and 15" diameters, totalling 2,063 yds. Surface Water Sewers of 7", 9", 12", 18" and 21" diameters totalling 1,020 yds. In addition, the Council repaired existing sewers, as follow :— Surface Water Sewers 9" diameter 69 yds. Schemes have been prepared for Foul Sewers 6" and 9" diameters 900 yds. Surface Water Sewers 9", 12" and 15" diameters, totalling 410 yds. Surface Water Sewers 24", 30", 33" and 36" diameters, totalling 740 yds. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948. Public Health Inspectors have made 220 visits of inspectior to factories with or without mechanical power, and building sites etc. which are controlled by these Acts. 28 nuisances or defect: were dealt with, some in conjunction with H.M. Inspector ol Factories. 38 The following tables give details of factories and the worli carried out thereat:— 1. Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health.

During the year, four licences to deal in Game were issued to local firms. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. Four visits were paid to various shops, etc. where oil, electric or gas heating apparatus is sold, to ensure that they complied with the safety requirements laid down. Since the Act has been in opera- 39 tion for nine years, it is not surprising that all heaters examined were found to be satisfactory. Regulations for drip feed and other oil heaters to be made under the Consumers Protection Act, 1961 are expected. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. Licences to sell pet animals were issued to proprietors of nine premises. Visits were paid to all these shops, and it was found that the sale of pets was on a small scale. No contraventions were detected. PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS, 1928 AND 1936. Mr. J. C. Kermode, Chief Public Health Inspector, is the Inspector appointed under the above Acts. Petroleum spirit and/or petroleum mixtures are stored at 60 premises, under licence. The total capacity is as follows :— Petroleum spirit in tanks 170,320 gallons. Petroleum mixture in tanks 8,980 gallons. Petroleum spirit in canned and approved stores 100 gallons. Petroleum mixture in canned and approved stores 4,343 gallons. 183,743 gallons. Carbide of calcium 100 lbs. A small quantity of petroleum is also kept without a licence, under the terms of the Petroleum Spirit (Motor Vehicles, etc.) Regulations, 1929. The total quantity of petroleum spirit stored in underground tanks at garages continues to increase, reflecting the ever growing consumption by motor vehicles. New installations are put in from time to time and when small tanks fall due for replacement, opportunity is usually taken to provide tanks of greater capacity. All this work is tested. PUBLIC CLEANSING, REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. I am indebted to the Cleansing, Salvage and Transport Officer for the following information. The volume of refuse is still increasing and this is in line with the general trend throughout the country, due in a large measure to the increased use of electricity and oil for heating. This trend demands changes in our transport requirements which means vehicles of larger capacity, with a high degree of packing in order to maintain schedules. Compression of refuse within the vehicle is now an important factor to avoid the uneconomic use of transport. 40 The number of premises cleared was in the region of 29,500 and as some of these buildings, particularly the large ones, use more than one bin, the number of journeys made by the collectors is substantial. It is estimated that 1,560,000 calls were made last year. In addition to dealing with special accumulations from trade premises, arrangements are in force for this service to be provided to individual householders. A charge is made, based on the actual cost of the job plus the usual oncosts. Whilst the volume of work involved is not great it does provide a useful outlet to people who have extra debris or refuse for disposal, and is appreciated. All night burning stoves are obviously used to a large extent and these bring added dangers from fire, owing to hot ashes being placed in the bin. The volume of refuse collected was in the region of 160,000 cubic yards. A further 12,000 cubic yards was received at the tip in the form of trade refuse, gully contents, street sweepings, trimmings from verges, etc. Kitchen waste amounted to 330 tons, and was cleared chiefly from individual containers in Mottingham and Lamorbey areas and a number of schools. About 3,000 containers are in use. Disposal of the refuse was carried out at St. Paul's Cray Hill Park, where low lying ground is being reclaimed. Further vehicles and trailers of improved design, fitted with diesel engines have been purchased. Salvage, including waste paper, has been maintained at a high level in spite of market difficulties. The demand for newspaper has improved; cardboard and mixed papers are in keen demand and so are textiles. Trade Refuse. As there appears to be some misunderstanding regarding the clearance of this material, it is perhaps desirable to make the position clear. The removal of Trade Refuse can only be undertaken by the department, providing payment is made in accordance with the scale of charges laid down by the Council in order to comply with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936. Charges for Removal of Trade Refuse:— Small quantities—6d. per bin or skep. Large quantities—Charge based on cost involved. Bulk container—£16 per annum for one collection per week. 41 The frequency of collection can be increased provided the extra cost is met by the trader concerned. Bulk Containers used in flats and other premises for storage of domestic refuse are emptied free of charge. The Bulk Storage Container System has many advantages where the volume of refuse to be dealt with is equal to 8 to 14 normal size bins. Storage is improved by this method and the containers are emptied hydraulically and without dissemination of dust. Bulk Container System. The Bulk container system was introduced to deal with refuse from flats, hospitals, hotels and other similar places in the district. Some of the main advantages are as follow:— 1. Improved storage. 1. The containers are emptied hydraulically, and the operation is dustless. 3. The containers cannot be interfered with by dogs or cats. 1. Wheie the volume of refuse is substantial it does away with the need for a large number of bins, which can look untidy and, take up a lot of room. Description of Containers. Containers of up to 1¼ cubic yards capacity are emptied on site into an SD Refuse Collection vehicle by an extremely simple method which does not involve any additional hydraulic gear or controls. Containers arc removed from chambers or other loading positions (where they stand on side sills) by a simple form of Jack Truck, by which they are lifted about 2" and transported to the rear of the vehicle adjacent to the lifting hooks. The safety catches are lifted and the container pushed against the lifting cradle when the catches are dropped over the container handle, after which no further action by the operator is necessary. The containers are lifted automatically from the truck by the forward tipping action of the body of the vehicle, and as the body lifts the container is tipped through a dustless sealed aperture in the rear door of the body. The refuse from each container has the full available depth of the body into which it can fall, this provides a substantial degree of consolidation of refuse in the body. When the body is again lowered, the container returns to the waiting Jack Truck and is automatically disconnected from the vehicle and can be immediately returned to the loading site. The total time for discharging each container into the vehicle is less than one minute from the arrival of the container on the truck to departure for repositioning on the loading site. 42 Bulk Loading Vehicle. This consists of a modified SD Fore and Aft Tipping Refuse Collector of 16/18 cubic yards capacity, which is fitted with a special rear door carrying the necessary hooks for container attachment and automatic safety locking gear. The upper part of the door carries an aperture through which the mouth of the container enters as the body lifts, this being dust proofed by the use of simple double doors and a ring of rubber flaps. This arrangement forms a fully effective dust screen and seals the entry of the container before refuse commences to fall. The upper portion of the door is hinged and spring loaded, which can be lifted without effort and locked in an open position to present a standard loading rave and a fall opening for use when discharging ordinary household bins at normal team loading rate from ground level. Discharge of the load is by rear tipping, the rear door opening automatically as in the standard Fore and Aft Tipping vehicle. Containers. The containers are of 1£ cubic yards capacity of 16 s.w.g. steel construction stiffened with angle and flat section bands, and carry the lifting bar for attachment to the vehicle. The whole being galvanised after welding. Dimensions, 4' 3" high X 3' diameter. Circular type, or alternatively with flat sides 2' 6" wide to suit narrow dust chambers, and are adapted to stand on concrete sills 24½" to 25" apart X 8½" to 9" high. These containers are now provided on caster wheels, this being a great advantage in many ways besides increasing their mobility. Prevention of Noise. A new type of bin is now on the market fitted with rubber lid and rubber base. This is an attempt to reduce noise and it is hoped these will find favour with the public. Plastic bins are also coming to the fore, unfortunately they are easily damaged, particularly by hot ashes. Labour. The shortage of labour and the continual movement of personnel has made it extremely difficult to maintain a weekly service; a heavy sickness toll has added to the difficulties of the department. In the past few years students have filled the gaps at certain periods, but this source did not produce the desired result this Christmas owing to more attractive employment being offered elsewhere. 43 Paper Bag System. This system which has many advantages over the metal sanitary bin system, is receiving substantial and continual publicity in the press, and whilst every one is interested in the hygienic storage and collection of refuse, it might be as well to mention one big factor to be taken into consideration and that is the extra cost the system would entail. The bags purchased in bulk cost between fourpence and fivepence each, and this must be added to the present cost of service. There is also the capital cost of the holders. There would however, be some saving in other directions but as yet there is no evidence to show its introduction would not entail an additional charge on the rates. Refuse Disposal. The disposal of all house and trade refuse is carried on at St. Paul's Cray Hill Park, where low-lying land is being reclaimed and when completed will be handed over as an agricultural unit. It is hoped to continue tipping at this site for a further two or three years and, to enable the department to achieve this object, further excavation work will be carried out on the site. The collection of waste paper will also make a valuable contribution towards extending the life of the tip. Whilst we are able to dispose of the refuse within the confines of the urban district, it avoids heavy transport costs; the time will however eventually arrive, when the question of going outside the district will become an urgent matter and, as the nearest site which might be considered suitable is as least 10 or 12 miles distant, the cost of disposal will be bound to increase. Waste Paper. In order to provide better and improved facilities for handling waste paper, a new baling shed has been erected at Beaverwood Road Depot and this will enable the department to deal more effectively with the volume of waste paper handled and allow for a progressive increase in output. In addition, a new Powell baling machine, together with elevators and screens, has been installed and this method will provide for better sorting and grading and quicker through-put of the waste paper, thereby allowing for a bigger tonnage to be handled at a reduced cost. The old shed has been converted into additional workshop accommodation which was sorely needed for the maintenance of all Council vehicles and plant. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. There are no premises in the district licensed under the Rag Flock Act. 44 RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939. There are now five stables from which horses are hired, for the purpose of riding. Animals, consisting of 29 horses and 76 ponies, were inspected by the Veterinary Surgeon appointed for the purpose. Five visits were made and the animals were reported to be in good health. The Inspectors paid a further 35 visits. It has not been necessary to require any substantial improvements to stables. RIVERS AND STREAMS. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that apart from the normal maintenance of streams and rivers for which he is responsible, only the normal patrolling has been found necessary. The Inspectoral staff also keep observation of rivers and streams principally to detect pollution, and 95 visits were made for this purpose. A watch is also kept for rodent infestation in the banks where rubbish is liable to accumulate and any infested lengths are treated. Rainfall and Flooding. The year was relatively dry. The total rainfall at 22.2 inches was 9.1 down on 1960, and in fact only equalled the fall for the last six months of that year. It was, however, some three inches above the fall for the dry year of 1959. Practically no rain fell in March, 1961, and only 9.54 in the first six months, compared with 14.22 in the second half of the year. On only three occasions did the fall exceed an inch in 24 hours. 1.3 inches on 4th May was of an intense nature and flooding occurred in North Sidcup, causing considerable inconvenience, particularly in Willersley Avenue. Conditions were aggravated by the overspill of sewage from a foul sewer, which has since been relieved by the construction of a new sewer. The 1.22 inches which fell on 12th June was prolonged, but not particularly intense. Considerable overspill of sewage took place in Station Road, Sidcup, but this was caused by an obstruction in the outfall manhole. 1.18 inches falling on 10th November did not result in flooding. Details of rainfall are as follow:— January 2.06 ins. February 1.84 ins. March 0.04 ins. April 2.10 ins. May 1.82 ins. June 1.68 ins. July 1.08 ins. August 2.14 ins. September 2.16 ins. October 3.26 ins. November 2.56 ins. December 2.98 ins. 23.72 ins. (1960—32.86 ins.) 45 RODENT CONTROL. There has been some increase in the rat population, resulting in a larger number of complaints being received (414 as compared with 324 in 1960), and more treatments of property being carried out (601 as against 566). It is thought that this increase is part of a natural process and not due to any deficiency in the methods of eradication employed. The poison warfarin, with an oatmeal base as recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is used both for surface and sewer infestations. It is regarded as being much less dangerous to animals and human beings, than materials previously laid. In this District, infestations are usually of a minor nature, only about 1 per cent, being classified as of greater proportions.

It is recognised that sewers, especially the older ones, often harbour rats, where they may feed and breed undisturbed. This may well serve as a "reservoir" for surface infestation. Hence an annual "test bait" is taken in about 10% of the sewer manholes, and this is followed by half yearly treatments of section of system, where evidence of rats was revealed. The degree of infestation in sewers as indicated by the "Takes" of bait recorded during treatments, shows a higher level than in the two previous years. Details are as follow:— Number of Manholes treated No. of manholes in which "Complete takes" "Partial takes" "No takes" Test bait 215 17 58 140 1st Maintenance Treatment (April) 205 16 78 111 2nd Maintenance Treatment (Oct.) 171 23 56 92 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.

The number of shops in the area remains very constant. The figure at the 31st December, 1961, shows an increase of five over that for 1960. This development has been confined to the High Street, Sidcup, area. The position throughout the district is as follows:— Lamorbey and Blackfen 262 Sidcup and Footscray 295 North Cray and St. Paul's Cray 113 Chislehurst and Mottingham 201 871 Under the Shops Act, premises have to comply with certain standards of lighting, heating, ventilation, sanitary and washing accommodation; facilities for staff to take meals and seats for female assistants. These requirements have been met in previous years and all plans of new premises, or alterations, are scrutinised to ensure that developers have made the necessary provisions. Other sections of the Act deal with the hours during which certain assistants may work and the hours during which sale of goods may or may not take place. Shops are permitted to remain open only for the sale of specified commodities, on the early closing day and on Sundays. During the year it was necessary to issue warnings to proprietors of a few small shops, who do not always observe these restrictions, especially on Sundays. There are no Closing Orders (in respect of the early closing day) operative in the district. Normally closing takes place as follows:— Wednesday—St. Paul's Cray L.C.C. Estate (except Leith Hill), Chislehurst, The Oval, Lamorbey. Thursday—Sidcup (other than above), North Cray, Mottingham. Some shops, however, close on days other than the above and provided they comply with certain conditions, this is permissible. The Council again decided to suspend the general closing hours for the period immediately preceding Christmas, but little advantage appears to have been taken of this concession. Visits and observations in connection with the Shops Act totalled 490, and the following infringements have been dealt with. 48 Offences remedied Notices and records 14 Sanitary Accommodation (defective and insufficient) 16 Washing facilities (defective and insufficient) 5 Temperature 2 Closing 5 Sunday trading 12 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. Recording of Atmospheric Pollution. The Council maintains apparatus for the measurement of atmospheric pollution at three stations within the district. Public Health Department, Manor House, Sidcup. The volumetric apparatus installed here, records the degree of pollution, from day to day, throughout the year. A pump draws a sample of air through a filter and the resulting deposit of tarry matter gives an indication of the amount of soot or smoke present. The air is also passed through a chemical solution which, when analysed, shows quantitively the concentration of the irritant gas sulphur dioxide, another product of combustion. Both these constituents of pollution are present to a much greater degree in winter, when domestic coal fires are lit and increase many-fold during persistent fog. The early part of 1961 was singularly free from fog and whilst it was more prevalent during the autumn, the only time when the atmosphere became heavily polluted was the period immediately preceding Christmas. County Primary Roman Catholic School, Lamorbey and Footscray County Primary School, Riverside Road, Sidcup. Sulphur dioxide candles are part of the equipment at these sites. Fresh candles are placed in position each month and the figures obtained, supplement the information given by the volumetric apparatus at the Manor House. The data for 1961 reveals figures consistently lower than in the previous year. The highest recording was obtained in Lamorbey for the month of November—2.76 milligrams of SO3 per day, collected by 100 sq. cms. PbO2 and the lowest at Riverside Road, which was 0.65 milligrams, in August. In conjunction with the candles at each of these sites, there are Deposit Gauges, also read monthly. These gauges detect the fallout of fine solid particles from the atmosphere. Their principle function is to record the pollution originating from several cement works, situated along the Thames Estuary. Recordings from these 49 gauges and, indeed, from other apparatus used in the district, form part of the survey carried out under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The results are co-ordinated by the Thames-side Joint Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution, which is constituted from those authorities principally affected by the deposit of cement flue dust. The Council's representatives on the Committee are Mr. F. Ambrose and Mr. A. V. Hatley. They have consistently pressed for vigorous action to abate the "cement dust nuisance" and the Committee is considering further the possibility of approaches being made to the Government at Ministerial level. According to the Deposit Gauges the total solids were consistently greater at Lamorbey than at Riverside Road. The highest readings were in December with 23.27 tons per square mile at the former, and in November with 16.85 tons at the latter. The minima were 8.18 tons at Riverside Road and 8.61 tons at Lamorbey, both in July. The average figure for all months at Riverside Road was 12.891 tons (14.583 in 1960) and at Lamorbey 12.367 tons (13.135 in 1960). This is a distinct improvement on the year, but regard should be paid to the effect of weather, particularly wind direction. It would be necessary to take figures over a period of several years to be certain that any apparent improvement was being maintained. The Council was also represented on the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies in the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee and on the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council by the Chairman and the Chief Public Health Inspector. Smoke Control Areas. The Chislehurst and Sidcup area is considered to be a "black area" under the Clean Air Act, and a start has been made in creating "Smoke Control Areas" which eventually will cover the whole district. The preliminary survey of the Mottingham South area was carried out and particulars submitted to the Ministry. At this stage, the Government decided to amend the procedure for establishing these areas and the necessity of obtaining preliminary sanction was abandoned. The carrying out of the detailed survey, which entails visiting each one of the 2,412 properties, interviewing the occupants, examining the existing appliances, and deciding what replacements are necesssary, is in progress. This work, which must be accomolished in addition to their many other duties, is placing a considerable burden on the Insnectors. A certain amount of visiting on Saturday mornings and during evenings has been found necessary. 50 Footscray County Primary School, Footscray. Monthly deposit in tons per square mile during 1961.

There are three swimming pools in the district, none of which are generally available to the public. In all cases water is mechanically filtered. Two baths are in the open air, one in the grounds of a factory and the other owned by a club. Two samples of water, taken by the Inspectors, from each of these baths, proved to be satisfactory. The third pool is covered and the water is heated as well as being filtered and chlorinated. Ten samples of water taken by the Authority owning it, were all quite satisfactory. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS AND INSECT PESTS. It was remarked earlier in this report that the modern outlook on infection and disinfection has undergone a radical change in the past quarter century. In like manner the pre-War Inspector was deeply involved in attempting to keep bed bugs and other vermin under control. In this, the materials at his disposal were very inferior, and the work, of necessity, caused considerable damage to properties concerned. Complete eradication with one treatment, was regarded as a rare triumph. In 1936, 91 premises and their contents were dealt with by the Department and many more were known to be infested with bed bugs. All that is past. Greatly improved cleanliness, a heightened sense of pride in the home and the efficacy of the modern residual insecticides have all but made this repulsive pest a rarity. Nevertheless, some 18 complaints were received, necessitating 27 visits. Many of these related to less harmful types of insects. One Council house was disinfested, together with nine other properties, although some of this work was of a precautionary nature. Complaints continue to be received concerning ant and wasp infestations and where possible advice is given. In connection with the latter insects, 42 enquiries were referred to an experienced person, who for many years has undertaken the destruction of wasps nests throughout the district. WATER SUPPLY. All dwelling houses in the district receive a piped supply from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. I am informed by the Director of Water Examination to the Board, that there has been no major change in the sources of supply to this area. They are well water from Bexley, 59 Darenth, Eynsford, Horton Kirby, North Orpington, Shortlands and Wilmington, together with River Thames derived filtered water. A summary of the results of bacteriological and chemical examination of these sources is set out in the following pages. The supply has been adequate during the year 1961. There have been no extensions of trunk mains, and a total length of 2,757 yards of supply main has been laid. The quality of the water has remained excellent and there have been no special cases of contamination. No instance of shortage of water in the district came to the notice of the Department during the year, although some lack of pressure in part of the Chislehurst area was reported. Two privately owned wells are in use supplying water for commercial purposes. From these, four samples were submitted for chemical analysis and four for bacteriological examination. All were reported to be satisfactory. Following a complaint, the Department also took one sample from a house supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. It proved satisfactory, both bacteriologically and chemically. 60 Average Results of the Bacteriological Examination of the water supplied to the Urban District of Chislehurst and Sidcup during 1961 Southern Group Bexley Well Darenth Well Eynsford No. 1 Eynsford No. 2 Source of Supply Shortlands No. 1 Shortlands No. 2 Shortlands No. 3 Wilmington No. 2 Horton Kirby No. 1 Horton Kirby No. 2 North Orpington Number of Samples — 248 226 154 163 211 151 176 74 108 223 196 Agar plate count per ml. 20-24 hours at 37°C. — 1.4 _ 0.2 _ 0.1 0.1 2.5 1.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 3 days at 22°C. — 147 38 74 4 28 26 26 3 7 9 49 Coliform count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml — 100 95.58 77.27 99.39 98.10 99.34 22.73 100 100 100 96.94 Count per 100 ml — — 0.1 0.9 — 0.2 — 9.6 — — — 0.1 Escherichia coli count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml — 100 99.12 92.21 100.0 99.05 100.0 46.59 100 100 100 100 Count per 100 ml — — — 0.3 — 0.2 — 3.9 — — — — Number of Samples 1,835 252 231 253 245 181 255 196 Agar plate count per ml. 20-24 hours at 37°C. 10.0 _ 0.1 — 0.1 0.3 — 0.1 3 days at 22°C — 64 718 4 63 6 2 2 Coliform count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml. 99.84 100 100 99.60 100 100 100 100 E. coli count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml 99.89 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 61 Average Results of the Chemical Examination of the water supplied to the Urban District of Chislehurst and Sidcup during 1961 Milligrammes per litre (unless otherwise stated).

The year has seen the completion of the original five years programme of slum clearance and the formulation of a further programme. The houses in the Clearance Area comprising 1-12 School Cottages, Church Road, Footscray, were purchased during the year. In addition to the two families rehoused in 1960, nine more were moved mainly to the newly constructed premises for elderly persons in Windsor Road, Footscray. Demolition of seven of the houses had been completed by the end of the year. Demolition of the 21 old houses in the Clearance Area comprising Nos. 3-18 Garden Place and 19-23 Garden Cottages, Footscray, also commenced during the year and 12 were razed to the ground before the end of December. 18 families comprising 64 persons were rehoused in Council Houses. Four houses—Nos. 13-16 Albert Road, Mottingham, were declared unfit and Demolition Orders were served on the owners. This last mentioned group of properties formed part of the new programme, in which 21 other houses are listed and which will be dealt with in the next few years. The Closing Order on No. 68 Corbylands Road, Sidcup, was determined after all works necessary to make it fit for occupation had been carried out. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS During the year, 86 applications were received for Improvement Grants, of which 58 were made. Details are as follow:— Discretionary Standard Grants Grants 1. Total applications received 66 20 2. Schemes approved 44 19 3. Amount involved in item 2 £24,679 7s. 6d. Not yet known 4. Grants made 43 15 5.

The vast majority of the Discretionary Grants were for the provision of bathrooms. In five cases additional accommodation was provided; in other cases cesspool drainage was changed to main drainage, dry rot was eliminated and rising dampness was cured. 66 The Standard Grants were expended as follow:— Hot water systems 23 Fixed baths 16 Internal W.C's 13 Wash hand basins 17 Food stores 13 RENT ACT, 1957.

MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. The operation of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960, has seen a radical change, not only in the number of sites in the district and the number of caravan homes on each, but more important a vast improvement has been secured in the amenities provided for the families concerned. When the Act came into force, 12 sites were known to exist in the district on which 50 families resided, comprising approximately 191 persons. Not all site owners applied for licences under the Act, but the following sites were in use at the end of 1961. Site Number of Vans Number of Families Appro*. No. or Occupants No. of Vans for which Licences issued Chalk Pit, Ruxley 25 24 100 25 Lower Hockenden Farm 1 1 2 1 Twysdens Meadow, Footscray 5 5 11 6 Sun Club, Hockenden 3 3 8 4 Greenwood, Birchwood 1 1 2 1 Cherry Tree Nursery, Foxbury 1 1 2 1 Conservative Club, Oxford Road 1 1 2 Application pending Shrubbery, Church Road, Footscray 1 1 2 Site likely to be demolished White House, Church Road, Footscray 2 1 2 Site likely to be demolished 68 Six licences have so far been issued and conditions attached to them not only govern the number of vans which may be stationed and the date by which they must be removed, but also set out in detail requirements with regard to water supply, sanitary accommodation, hard standings, etc. These conditions have been varied from site to site depending on the situation, duration of licence, and so on. Thus the requirements for the small site for one agricultural worker have been made simple and in keeping with their surroundings. A great transformation has been accomplished at the Chalk Pit, Ruxley, where the number of caravans has been reduced to 25, hard standings and roadways have been laid, each family has its own closet and electricity supply point and a cesspool has been constructed to take effluent. Another interesting experiment on a smaller scale, is taking shape at Twysdens Meadow, Footscray, where the owner of this site for six caravans is providing an ablution block complete with hot water, bath and laundry facilities. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered Common Lodging Houses in the area. SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. 70 SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. INSPECTIONS. The number of shops from which food is sold, increases, largely due to the tendency for certain trades to sell foodstuffs as a side line. These shops, together with bakehouses, cafes, canteens, public houses, etc. now bring the total of "food premises" to 494. The year has been noteworthy for an increase in the self service type of grocery store and the opening of a very large factory for the preparation of soft drinks in the district. All these businesses come within the purview of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960, and comply with its structural requirements. Plans for new buildings or extension to existing premises are scrutinised by the Department to ensure that standards are maintained. Visits by the Inspectoral staff to food premises is still a vital part of the Department's work. Food rooms must be maintained with a strict regard for hygiene and, even more important, food handlers must be kept alive to their responsibilities. The objective is to ensure that food is sold in good condition and even more important that it be entirly safe. This is a matter in which the training of personnel is more important than the provision of ideal equipment. For this purpose 3,182 visits have been paid, 48 written notices served, and 231 defects remedied. FOOD COMPLAINTS. Under the Food and Drugs Act, the sale of food not of the nature, substance or quality demanded is an offence. It is an offence which seems to grow more prevalent, if the number of complaints concerning food is to be used as a guide. The reasons for this increase are not hard to find. The very large factory type bakery, with its elaborate machinery, is more liable to give rise to a loaf! containing machine oil or a piece of machinery, than the small bakehouse, where mixing is by hand. The mass production of perishable cooked meat products which may have to pass through a number of hands before reaching the consumer, are more likely to produce items which may be out of condition, than those prepared on the vendors' premises. Again, 71 the self service system obviously tends to interfere with the proper rotation of stock. The large food producers, although prepared to provide machinery of the highest order to detect the presence of impurities, are in fact, unable to prevent offences arising from the human element. A great deal of the Inspectors' time is occupied in the detailed investigation of these foods complaints. Premises must be examined; assistants interviewed; the possibility of errors or misrepresentations on the part of complainants considered. Analysts' reports and manufacturers' comments obtained; the constituents of the article traced back to their sources and reports called for from the various Local Authorities concerned. Similarly, a considerable proportion of the Committee's deliberations is devoted to this subject. Forty-six investigations, along these lines, were conducted in 1961, compared with 33 in the previous year. The largest number referred to cereals, bread and flour confectionery, which were found to contain impurities, such as wire or stray insects. Perhaps more serious were those sold in a condition indicative of undue age, such as rotten eggs, infested cereal and mould on sausages, pies and confectionery. Complaints about dirty milk bottles appear to be on the decrease although the misuse to which these receptables are subject is a very convincing reason for the Dairy Companies to press forward with plans to utilise non-returnable containers. Other interesting investigations concerned tainted fruit squash traced to a spray used on the oranges concerned, and a wasp found in frozen raspberries, where the occurrence was drawn to the attention of the authorities in the exporting country. The following prosecutions were instituted :— Sale of rotten eggs—fined £20 plus £5 5s. costs. Mould in puff pastry—case adjourned sine die. Maggots in cake mix—fined £20. Mould in sponge cake—fined £10 plus £6 5s. costs. Bristles in loaf—fined £30 plus £10 10s. costs. Wire in loaf—fined £15 plus £7 7s. costs. Decaying matter in bottle of milk—fined £30 plus £5 5s. costs. Mould in meat pie—fined £10 plus £5 5s. costs. Mould in meat pie—fined £10 plus £5 5s. costs. Metal in meat pie—fined £25 plus £5 5s. costs. Mould on sausages—fined £20 plus £7 7s. costs. Mould on meat pie—fined £10 plus £6 15s. costs. 72 FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955.

The following were currently held on 31st December, 1961:— Pasteurised 23 Sterilised 28 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 22 No processing of milk takes place within the district. 77 The number of automatic milk vending machines continues to increase, there now being five. All but one of these are on the forecourt of milk distributor's premises. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. Twenty-one samples of designated milk were taken with the following results:— Number passing phosphatase test 18 Number failing phosphatase test — Number passing methylene blue test 17 Number giving unsatisfactory methylene blue result 1 Number passing the turbidity test (sterilised) 3 Number failing turbidity test (sterilised) — Twenty-one samples of milk were submitted for chemical examination, all of which proved satisfactory. ICE CREAM. Seventeen samples were taken during the year. Nine were placed in Grade I, five in Grade II and two in Grade III, and one in Grade IV. Investigations were made into the circumstances surrounding unsatisfactory samples and where necessary follow-up samples were purchased. No manufacture of ice cream takes place within the district. PIGGERIES. There are 14 piggeries in the district, indicating no change from the previous year. The number of pigs kept is approximately 2,020. One large piggery houses 1,000 animals and two others 750 and 270 respectively. Eighty-five visits have been paid to these sties. SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 80 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. General. In my report for I960, attention was drawn to the rather misleading effect on the total of notifications of infectious diseases received, produced by those relating to the childhood disease of measles. For example, the total number of notifications received in 1960 was 391, and of this number only 26 related to measles. The total figure for 1961 leapt to 2,016, but measles accounted for no fewer than 1,863 of these, leaving the very low figure of 153 notifications of other diseases. 1961 was a very satisfactory year from the infectious diseases point of view, no cases of poliomyelitis, typhoid fever, diphtheria or other serious diseases being reported. One case of Anthrax was reported during the year. Investigations showed that the patient was engaged in the leather dressing trade, and imported skins were undoubtedly the source of infection. The patient recovered satisfactorily after hospital treatment. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis and Vaccination. There was a complete absence of this disease in the Urban District in 1961. The County Medical Officer has kindly supplied the following details of the number of injections given in the various priority groups during the year:— Priority Group 2nd injections 3rd injections 4th injections 1957-1961 1,352 1,227 — 1946-1956 390 1,080 — 1943-1945 70 124 — 1933-1942 479 558 — 1921-1932 1,534 2,144 — Others 100 88 — School Children under 12 years of age- - — 6,162 Totals 3,925 5,221 6,162 Diphtheria and Diphtheria Immunisation. Once again I am pleased to report that no cases of this disease occurred in the area during the year. The following figures, which have been furnished by the County Medical Officer, give details of immunisation carried out in 1961:— 81  Diphtheria Immunisation (Singly or in combination) Year of Birth Primary Reinforcing 1961 490 — 1960 661 19 1959 120 140 1958 54 79 1957 48 75 1952/1956 150 919 1947/1951 35 212 Totals 1,558 1,444 Dysentery. Although the number of cases at 42 shows only a slight decrease on 1960, more than one half of these occurred in a single outbreak at a local institution. It was very successfully contained, following prompt action by all concerned. Most of the other cases were from another children's institution, and had been moved into this area from emergency accommodation in London. Food Poisoning. It is too early to state that the decrease in the incidence of food poisoning is due to the application of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, although doubtlessly, this legislation has played its part. The decrease in this area has been progressive for the past few years and compares very favourably with a similar trend throughout the country. The corrected number of notifications for the year is five and a further five sufferers were discovered during investigations. The most noteworthy of these "outbreaks" was one affecting four members of a family and was due to "Salmonella Virchow". In spite of investigations involving the examination of 11 specimens, no definite source was discovered. All cases were of a relatively mild nature. The following is a copy of the annual return rendered to the Ministry of Health:— 1. Name of Local Authority: Chislehurst & Sidcup Urban District Council. Year: 1961. 2.

The measles epidemic in the Spring resulted in the notification of 1,863 cases. Of these, 503 were received in February and 843 in March. Generally, the disease was of a mild nature, although 44 cases were removed to hospitals, mainly due to absence of facilities for nursing at their residences. The outbreak subsided very rapidly, there being five notifications in August and none by December. No deaths from this disease were recorded. Meningococcal Infections. No cases were notified during 1961. Pneumonia. Twenty-one cases were notified as against 15 in the previous year. 83 There were 41 deaths attributed to pneumonia, but this figure includes people who are normally resident in the Urban District and who died outside the area. Scarlet Fever. 27 cases were notified compared with 63 in 1960. This disease is now of a very mild nature, but 7 cases were removed to isolation hospital. No deaths from this disease were recorded. In the year 1936, there were 162 cases notified, of which 138 were sufficiently serious to be removed to hospital. Smallpox and Vaccination. Notification was received that three persons had travelled on a ship from a foreign port in which a case of Smallpox had been discovered. The usual procedure of placing these suspected contacts under surveillance for 16 days was put into effect after their arrival in this district. The staff of the Public Health Department are vaccinated against Smallpox from year to year, a precaution which was to prove valuable in the investigations during the early part of 1962, following the importation into this country in December, 1961, of cases of Smallpox from Pakistan. Persons travelling to certain countries abroad must furnish themselves with International Certificates of Vaccination. These must be stamped in the Department and 482 were dealt with in 1961. The County Medical Officer informs me that a total of 1,058 residents in the area received primary vaccination and 14 re-vaccination in 1961. Tuberculosis. The following table shows the position with regard to tuberculosis, with comparative figures for the past 10 years (as corrected by inward and outward transfers). In other parts of this report comparison was made to conditions in 1936. No sharper contrast could be found than those revealed by the statistics for tuberculosis. In that year 65 new cases were reported. In the post war period, 119 were recorded in 1948. Thereafter, a rapid decrease was seen and the figure for 1961 shows a further spectacular drop to 17. There were six deaths from tuberculosis during the year. 84 TUBERCULOSIS 1961 Year Population Notifications Number of Caaee on Register Pulm. Non-Pulm. Pulm. Non-Pulm.

I am indebted to the Liaison Officer of the above Committee for the following information:— "The work of the Committee has followed the usual pattern— assisting many families with fuel, hire purchase debts, fares to visit patients, clothing, footwear, etc., and for several families, holidays were provided. The closest liaison is maintained with all Statutory Bodies, and the W.V.S. are most helpful in every possible way. The Office at the United Services Club, 108, Main Road, Sidcup, continued to be open every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and regular home visits were also paid to many patients." Typhoid and Para-Typhoid Fever. No cases were notified in 1961. Whooping Cough. 48 cases were reported as compared with 231 in 1960, and only one case was removed to hospital. The disease continues to be mild in character. No deaths were recorded. I understand from the County Medical Officer that a total of 1,414 children resident in the Urban District were immunised against this disease during 1961. Other Infectious Diseases. In addition to those mentioned previously in this report, notifications were received as under:— Puerperal Pyrexia2 (hospital cases) Erysipelas 6 (1 removed to hospital) APPENDIX.
