AC 4349 PAD 62 Metropolitan Borough of Daddington REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1962 H. LESLIE OLDERSHAW, M.D. (London), B.S., D.P.H. CONTENTS Page Public Health Committee 5 Council's Representatives on other Committees 5 Staff 5 Summary of Statistics 7 Infectious and Other Diseases 12 Sanitary Circumstances 16 Food—Inspection and Supervision 23 Housing 31 Public Analyst's Report 36 Welfare Officer's Report 39 Index 45 Except where otherwise indicated, the figures in brackets throughout this Report are the figures for 1961, and are shown for comparison. 3 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1962. (1) Vital Statistics The main causes of death continue to be heart disease and carcinoma, with a particular emphasis in respect of the lung and bronchus. Unhappily the illegitimate live birth rate has reached a higher figure than ever before. In 1962 it was 25 per cent (cf. 21 per cent in 1961). (2) Infectious Disease The incidence of infectious disease in the Borough has again been minimal. There were 3 notifications of typhoid fever and 2 of poliomyelitis, one of which was paralytic. Special reference to Venereal disease is made in the body of the report. (3) Staff The Council decided to appoint a Chief Public Health Inspector to strengthen the administrative section of the department—a position which already obtains in most Metropolitan Boroughs. Accordingly Mr. E. W. Pike, previously Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector of Hammersmith, joined us in May, 1962. Already the inspectorate has benefitted from his knowledge and experience, particularly in respect of our intricate housing problems. I am pleased to record that during the year two of the Council's Student Public Health Inspectors qualified and are now on our staff. Three other Public Health Inspectors were also recruited, but unfortunately two Inspectors left for other appointments. At the end of the year the Public Health Inspectors were still three under establishment. (4) Housing Act, 1961 I would like to make particular reference to the Housing Act, 1961, which has occupied much of the time in the department and to which particular reference is made in the report. (5) Other Reports I include the reports of the Borough Analyst (Mr. Marshall) and the Borough Welfare Officer (Miss Harrison), and to both I would like to draw the special attention of the Council. 4 (6) Conclusion I would like to express my gratitude for the help and cooperation I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and in particular to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. LESLIE OLDERSHAW, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1963.

I am not able therefore to advise the Council of the number of new cases occurring in the Borough. I am only able to refer to the published figures of the number of new cases of Venereal Disease treated in hospital clinics throughout England and Wales. From 1954 until 1961 there had been an ever increasing number of cases of Venereal Disease, indeed the number of new cases of gonorrhoea treated in hospital clinics in 1961 was double that in 1954. However, it is pleasing to note that in 1962 the figures are rather lower than those for 1961. Studies of the national figures reveal, inter alia, 1. A serious increase in young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years. 2. Over half the males attending clinics are immigrants, the vast majority of whom contracted the infection in this country. 14 Tuberculosis.—The ward distribution of the cases of tuberculosis notified during 1962 is as follows:— Ward Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Total Males Females Males Females Queen's Park 7 3 1 — 11 Harrow Road North 12 2 2 3 19 Harrow Road South 9 12 3 2 26 Maida Vale North 6 10 — 1 17 Maida Vale South 2 4 — — 6 Town 3 1 — — 4 Readings 7 6 1 — 14 Church 6 — 1 7 Westbourne 12 5 1 3 21 Lancaster Gate West 9 3 — — 12 Lancaster Gate East 11 5 1 — 17 Hyde Park 8 1 — 1 10 Borough 92 52 9 11 164 There were 9 deaths from respiratory tuberculosis and NIL from other forms of tuberculosis during the year. International certificates.—During the year 3,359(2,201) certificates of inoculation or vaccination were submitted by persons travelling abroad for the authentication of the signature of the medical practitioner concerned. This authentication is required under the World Health Organisation agreement. Visiting.—The investigation of cases of food poisoning are made by the Food Inspectors; and the London County Council Health Visitors visit cases of puerperal pyrexia, ophthalmia neonatorum, infective enteritis and tuberculosis. The two Borough Council Visitors investigate all other cases of infectious disease (in addition to their work in connection with elderly people which is reported under "Care of the Aged") and during the year they made 535 (1,437) visits in the course of these investigations. Bacteriological examinations.—The number of examinations made in connection with infectious disease was 265 (743). Vaccination and immunisation.—The following figures relate to inoculations given at Paddington clinics by the staff of the London County Council and by local practitioners and have been supplied by the Divisional Medical Officer. diphtheria immunisation Primary courses Reinforcing injections By London County Council staff 1,536 865 By General Practitioners 143 49 15 whooping cough immunisation Primary courses Reinforcing injections By London County Council staff 1,397 252 By General Practitioners 138 39 poliomyelitis vaccination Primary courses Third injection Fourth injection Injection By London County Council staff 870 2,593 797 By General Practitioners 606 743 79 Oral Primary courses By London County Council staff 886 By General Practitioners 113 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL SERVICES.—The following Clinics and Day Nurseries in the Borough are provided by the London County Council.

Access to the Baths is via Kensal Road or, often more conveniently, from the Harrow Road by means of the footbridge over the Grand Union Canal opposite Second Avenue. In addition to the facilities for the treatment of scabies and delousing there is an American type steam disinfecting apparatus, and an Electrolux rotary washing machine for the incontinent laundry service. The staff of the medicinal baths and disinfecting service also deal with the laundry and home bathing, further details of which will be found under " Care of the Aged PROTECTIVE HELMETS.—During the year shops selling protective helmets were visited and samples of the stocks were inspected to ensure that the helmets had been certified by the British Standards Institute as required by the Motor Cycles (Protective Helmets) Regulations, 1957. No infringement of the Regulations was found. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS.—There are 98 (94) hairdressers and barbers establishments in the Borough registered under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. RAG FLOCK ACT.—Three (3) premises where filling material is used were on the register at the end of the year. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock is manufactured or stored. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACTS.—At the end of the year the register contained the names of 69 (88) persons entitled to sell the poisons scheduled in Part II of the Poisons List. DRAINAGE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.—During the year 233 (242) plans were deposited for drainage work in existing buildings. PET ANIMALS ACT.—Five (4) applications for licences for pet shops were made and granted. During the year one shop ceased business. BURIALS.—During the year 49 (38) burials and 4 (1) cremations were arranged under the National Assistance Act, 1948. MORTUARY.—Bodies from Paddington are now taken to the St. Pancras Borough Council mortuary when private arrangements are not made. During the year 284 (265) bodies were taken there and 283 (265) post mortem examinations were carried out. BAKEHOUSES.—At the end of the year there were 11 (11) level bakehouses in operation. COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—There are no Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. MASS X-RAY.—Dr. G. Z. Brett, the Physician-in-Charge of the Mass X-Ray Unit, has reported that during 1962, the number of people X-rayed in the Borough was 3,536. One active case of pulmonary tuberculosis and one case of tuberculosis under observation was found. 21 CONTRIBUTIONS TO ORGANISATIONS—Among the Organisations to which the Council make grants the following are closely associated with the work of the Public Health Department:— Organisation Grant £ s. d. Family Welfare Association 150 0 0 Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee 1,415 0 0 W.V.S. (for meals-on-wheels service) 480 0 0 Kensington and Paddington Family Service Unit 200 0 0 Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 25 4 0 Central Council for Health Education 16 0 0 Noise Abatement Society 5 5 0 British Standards Institute 10 10 0 HEALTH EDUCATION During the year the question of publicity directed towards education in health matters received regular attention. Each month posters on a number of subjects were displayed on the Council's notice boards and leaflets made available in the Council's offices visited by the general public. Among other matters receiving attention in this way were Food Hygiene; Accidents in the Home; Smoking and Lung Cancer ; and Venereal Diseases. At the request of the Ministry of Health, this latter subject received special attention. In addition to display on the notice boards mentioned above, posters were displayed in the public conveniences together with details of all the special clinics in London. With the co-operation of the local publicans stick-on notices were also provided for display in the conveniences at the public houses in the Borough. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The success or otherwise of the application of the Clean Act Act, which is completing its sixth year of operation, received much attention consequent upon the "smog" that descended upon the capital on the 3rd to 7th December. Paddington in common with other Boroughs with a predominance of residential buildings, gradually being absorbed in smoke control areas, has seen a steady fall in the amount of smoke emitted in the atmosphere but with only a slight reduction in sulphur dioxide concentration and this was reflected during the " smog Present research, however, seems to indicate that a combination of smoke, acid gases and droplets are the root of the problem, and the so-called "smogs" are only acute manifestations of air pollution. Bearing in mind the emphasis on the role played by smoke from domestic chimneys, the ever increasing application of Smoke Control Orders must have a cumulative effect, which will testify to the success of the Clean Air Act in the future. Smoke control areas.—The Council's revised programme envisages that the whole Borough will be a smokeless zone by 1968. The present position is as follows:— Hyde Park No. 1 Order. Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 31st October, 1959. 22 Lancaster Gate East Order. Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 1st November, 1960. Lancaster Gate West Order. Confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and in operation from the 1st August, 1962. This Order was delayed by the Minister's decision to hold a local Inquiry following the receipt of objections from two residents. Westbourne No. 1 Order. Order made but one objection made. Inquiry held by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and Order confirmed with an operation date of 1st November, 1963. Westbourne No. 2 Order. Preliminary survey is being carried out. During the year the Clean Air section has been strengthened by the appointment of a Technical Officer to assist in matters associated with the adaptation of domestic fire grates, and the Council's programme to make the whole of the Borough "smokeless" by 1968 should be attained provided that progress is not retarded by the Minister having to hold formal Inquiries to hear objectors before confirming Orders, by any other circumstances beyond the Department's control, and provided our staff position does not deteriorate numerically. Measurement of atmospheric pollution.—The results obtained from the recording apparatus at the Welfare Centre, 283a, Harrow Road, during 1962 are given below. Month Rainfall in mms. Insoluble deposits in tons per square mile Soluble deposits in tons per square mile S.O. in mgs. per day per 100 square cms.

The Clean Air Inspector is responsible for the routine inspection of all large sized boiler plants, and investigations and advice to operatives following complaints of smoke emissions. FOOD SUPERVISION Unsound food.—Approximately 6 (10) tons of diseased or unsound food was seized or surrendered for destruction. Diseased meat is incinerated, and other condemned food disposed of through the normal refuse channels. The following figures for 1962 are submitted:— No. of notifications under Sec. 3 (3) of intention to instal a furnace 10 (21) No. of applications under Sec. 3 (2) for prior approval of the proposals 1 (8) No. of applications under Sec. 3 (2) approved by the Council 1 (8) Registrations.—The following registrations were in force at the end of the year under the Milk and Dairies Regulations or the Food and Drugs Act. Distributors of milk 144(141) Dairies - (-) Ice-cream premises 211 (211) Food premises 54 (57) 24 Food shops.—Following are the details of the food shops in the Borough at the end of the year:— Bakers and cake shops 31 (34) Butchers 53 (56) Confectioners 129 (127) Chemists 39 (41) Fishmongers 14 (14) Fried fish shops 13 (13) Grocers 29 (42) General shops 23 (27) Provision stores 118 (114) Domestic stores 15 (19) Corn chandlers 3 (3) Greengrocers and fruiterers 72 (76) Public Houses 96 (99) Cider Houses 1 (1) Off licences 53 (55) Restaurants and cafes 131 (138) During the year 2,390 (2,451) visits were paid to food shops by the Food Inspectors. Canteens.—There are approximately 30 canteens of various sizes in the Borough. Wholesale food stores.—There are 18 (17) wholesale food stores in the Borough. Food factories.—There are 7 (9) food factories in the Borough including 1 (2) ice cream factory. Sampling.—During the year 500 (500) samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Prosecutions in respect of samples are reported under " Legal Proceedings." The report of the Public Analyst will be found as an appendix. Bacteriological examinations.—Twenty-four ice cream samples were graded as follows:— Grade 1 22 Grade 2 2 Grade 3 — Grade 4 — Twenty-four (58) samples of milk were examined and all conformed to the standards required by the Milk Regulations. Street Traders.—The Council have licenced 7 (7) coffee stalls, 21 (21) fruit and vegetable stalls and 2 (2) ice-cream stalls. Milk Licences.—The following Dealers' (Pre-packed Milk) Licences were in force at the end of the year:— Tuberculin Tested 105 (115) Pasteurised 130 (113) Sterilised 124 (127) 25 These licences are valid until the 31st December, 1965. Milk Vending Machines are now licensed under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, and seventeen machines were licensed, also until the 31st December, 1965. Food Poisoning.—The Food Inspectors made 156 (178) visits in connection with enquiries into cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning. SEWAGE.—The Minister of Health has requested that this Report should indicate whether the arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the district are reasonably adequate. I have consulted the Borough Engineer & Surveyor and he informs me that the County Council sewers crossing the Borough do become surcharged on occasions, and under these conditions are unable to accept the discharge from the Borough Council sewers. This problem, of course, also affects other Boroughs and the County Council are supplied with full details to assist them in dealing with the problem. The disposal of sewage is a matter for which the London County Council are responsible. The sewage from Paddington goes to the Northern Outfall Works at Beckton. At these works the sewage is treated and separated into effluent sufficiently pure to be discharged into the Thames, and sludge which is disposed of at sea. 26 RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, during the year:— Dwelling Houses All other property Total Number of properties in district 31,613 (31,487) 7,224 (7,264) 38,837 (38,751) Number of properties inspected as a result of— (a) Notification 389 (470) 102 (94) 491 (564) (b) Survey 125 (130) 2 (-) 127 (130) (c) Otherwise 2 (—) 1 (—) 3 (-) Total inspections and re-inspections 2,713 (3,718) 805 (829) 3,518 (4,547) Number of properties found to be infested by- fa) Rats— Major infestation - (-) - (-) - (-) Minor infestation 136 (187) 34 (29) 170 (216) (b) Mice— Major infestation - (-) - (-) - (-) Minor infestation 233 (278) 66 (63) 299 (341) Number of infested properties treated by the Council 369 (459) 98 (90) 467 (549) Total treatments and re-treatments 406 (489) 108 (103) 514 (592) It was not found necessary to serve any notices under the Act. One block control scheme was carried out and the sewers in the Borough were treated twice during the year. In December the Council decided that, as from the 1st January, 1962, the charge for the service given by the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 should be increased from 7s. 6d. to 10s. Od. per man hour. NOISE.—During the year 34 complaints of noise were received from the public. Some of these, however, did not come within the scope of either the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, nor the Good Rule and Government Byelaws made by the Council. No formal action was necessary under the Noise Abatement Act, the noises which contravened this Act being abated on informal representations from this Department. Informal approaches to the other offenders also sometimes resulted in the noise being abated, if only temporarily, and where appropriate the attention of the complainants was drawn to the action which could be taken under the Good Rule and Government Byelaws. 27 PIGEONS.—Six complaints about pigeons were received during the year and were dealt with by advice from the Public Health Inspectors, or by informal action if their congregation was caused by someone feeding them. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS.—Water for the two swimming baths in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains. Apart from routine tests by the Baths' staff thirteen samples were taken for bacteriological and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst during the summer months. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and the Director of Water Examination (E. Windle Taylor, M.A., M.D., D.P.H.) has kindly supplied the following report and figures. The water is derived from the River Thames, stored in the Board's reservoirs in the Thames Valley and filtered and chlorinated at the Board's works at Hampton and Ashford Common. SOURCE OF SUPPLY Chemical Examination Hampton Ashford Common Number of samples 52 52 Ammonia nitrogen 0.040 0.046 Albuminoid nitrogen 0.078 0.081 Nitrate nitrogen 40 4.0 Chlorides as Chlorine 31 31 Oxygen absorbed from permanganate (four hours at 27°C.) 1.12 1.14 Turbidity units 0.3 0.2 Colour—Burgess's Tintometer 12 12 Hardness (total) 264 276 Hardness (non-carbonate) 58 58 pH value 7.8 7.9 Phosphate as P04 1.2 1.3 Silicate as Si02 9 10 Sulphate as S04 61 61 Fluoride as F 0.25 0.25 Magnesium as Mg 6 6 Surface active material as Manoxol 0.12 0.12 Electrical conductivity (micromhos) 550 560 The above figures are given as milligrammes per litre unless otherwise stated.

According to the Registrar General's census of 1961 which has recently become available there were then 12,549 persons aged 65 years and over in the Borough. Also on the authority of the Ministry of Health Report "The Development of Community Care " these numbers will increase during the next 20 years by some 32.5 per cent. It is estimated that 10 per cent, (in Paddington some 1,250) of the elderly living at home are housebound. These figures provide some guide to the extent of the problem in the Borough. General.—At the end of the year there were 559 (401) names on the register of old people who are visited regularly. In addition 22 (79) other elderly people were visited but not put on the register as regular visiting was unnecessary. The two Visitors made 3,283 (3,663) visits and the Public Health Inspectors 28 (25) visits to old people during the year. Home bathing.—Sixty-nine (68) persons were given 1,611 (1,665) baths at home during the year. Laundering of Linen.—The number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year by the laundry service was 25 (20). Fifty-two (59) people received help from the service during the year. National Assistance Acts.—It was found necessary to apply to the Court for the compulsory removal to hospital of one person during the year. He was aged 80, and was infirm and suffering from malnutrition. In addition he was living in very insanitary conditions and had no one to look after him. He died in hospital two weeks after being admitted. Holiday Home.—The following guests were accommodated at "Kincardine". Guests stay for a fortnight during January, February, March and November and for a week during the remainder of the year. No. of applications received 829 No. of Guests accommodated 580 Applicants refusing holiday offered:— Date offered unacceptable 54 Private reasons 41 Illness 72 Death of applicant, friend or relative 12 Removed from borough subsequent to offer 3 Private holiday taken 7 Obtained employment 4 Applicants not offered a holiday:— Removed from borough 1 Died 8 Single rooms not available 19 Priority not reached 28 Of the 580 guests accommodated, 142 were having their first holiday at the Home. At Christmas a further sixteen guests were selected from seventy-six applicants and spent a week at the Home. 29 In addition to the services provided by the Paddington Borough Council for the elderly, a number of voluntary organisations provide the following supporting services which enable the elderly person to remain at home: Meals on Wheels.—In Paddington the provision of hot meals at the home of the elderly devolves mainly on the Women's Voluntary Services, who deliver meals twice a week to any one person, and I understand the service is restricted to the housebound. The Salvation Army also supply meals, but their scheme would appear to be restricted in its scope owing to the difficulties of transport. The Invalid Meals Service, organised by the London County Council, has of course a wider scope than meals for the elderly and is used for appropriate cases. I would like to stress the importance of the possibility of the use of individual frozen meals to the elderly in their homes, as an adjunct to the Meals on Wheels Service. The advantages of this service are:— (a) The possibility of storage, before delivery, in proper cold stores. (b) The times of delivery to the recipient are not limited. (c) Greater ease of handling. (d) There is no need for the meal to be eaten at the time of of delivery if the recipient so wishes. (e) The method of heating is simple (even with the best equipment hot meals often need re-heating when delivered). The disadvantages are:— (a) They are not suitable for all (e.g. the blind and the feeble). (b) There is a need to educate the recipients in the proper use of the meals. Bearing the above in mind, I feel that a greater use of frozen meals in conjunction with the Meals on Wheels Service is to be advocated. Chiropody.—In Paddington this service is provided both by the Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee and by the London County Council. The Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee scheme provides for the following:— (a) Some 1,500 treatments per year at the surgery of a local Chiropodist. (b) The equivalent of two sessions per week at a clinic at Leonora House. (c) Some 650 treatments at the homes of the housebound. The London County Council hold a foot clinic at the Welfare Centre, 283a Harrow Road, on six occasions each week. These clinics are not exclusively for the elderly. Home Helps.—This service provided by the London County Council is particularly of assistance to the elderly. It has expanded considerably over the last few years, and there are now some 100 30 home helps in Paddington compared with 25 in 1947. The service is generally speaking adequate, and with very few exceptions requests for Home Helps have been met expeditiously. Recreational Centres.—A number of clubs for the elderly are organised by the Women's Voluntary Services, the Salvation Army and the Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee. Three of the clubs provide meals, one each by the aforementioned organisations. Social visiting.—This is a service which is particularly suitable for voluntary provision, and the possibility of one of the organisations interested in the welfare of the elderly co-ordinating the service and requests for social visiting, is being considered. HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 AND HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 When applications are made to the Council for either discretionary or standard Improvement Grants the Public Health Department is asked to comment on the scheme submitted. If a grant is made, any works carried out have to be to the satisfaction of this department so far as public health matters are involved, e.g. drainage, underground rooms. During 1962 the department's comments were invited upon 39 (61) applications, but not all of these were proceeded with. The department is also asked to supply information regarding the property (the existence of closing orders; permitted numbers, etc.) before the Council considers applications for loans for house purchase, and 101 (116) such cases were dealt with during the year. BRAITHWAITE PLACE/ADPAR STREET CLEARANCE AREA During the year the Council rehoused the remainder of the families in the Area and all the premises in the Area were demolished. LICENSING ACT, 1961.—Part III of this Act came into force on the 1st March, 1962. It introduced legislation which requires the registration of all clubs selling or supplying intoxicating liquor with Marylebone Magistrates' Court. The Borough Council may object on a number of grounds but that which affects the Public Health Department is " that the premises are not suitable and convenient for a Club ". Applications are referred to the Department by the Town Clerk for report and invariably this necessitates at least one visit by the Public Health Inspector. The premises are inspected to ensure:— 31 (a) that they are satisfactory from the point of view of maintenance and repair; (b) that suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation is available, separate for the sexes; (c) that adequate natural or mechanical ventilation is provided and satisfactory lighting; (d) that a proper water supply and washing up facilities are provided; (e) that accommodation for the storage and preparation of food, where meals or snacks are served is satisfactory; and (/) that compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations will be assured. In addition to the above Section 35 of the Act enables a club to apply for a Justices' Licence. The Council may object to such an application on any ground, but as far as this department is concerned the same considerations apply as to an application for a registration certificate. During the year 115 applications under the Act were referred to the department for report. In a large number of cases subsequent visits had to be made to ensure that undertakings given to the Court or the Justices were complied with. HOUSING Housing Act, 1957—Overcrowding (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 120 (152) (2) Number of families dwelling therein 123 (156) (3) Number of persons dwelling therein 556 (703*) (Units) (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 32 (52) (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 64 (67) (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases 274 (292) (Units) (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling houses have again become overcrowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil Nil The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1962 was 120 (152). There were 44 (44) basement dwellings on the Register. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 17 (15) were rehoused by the London County Council, 15 (2) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 26 (31) secured accommodation privately and 6 (19) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. 32 The practice of sending warning letters to owners against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding has been abated. Section 80 of the Housing Act 1957 gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year the Council issued no licences under this section. During the year a total of 201 (216) Paddington families were rehoused by the London County Council and 194 (109) by the Borough Council. Housing Accommodation—Preferential Treatment During the year 308 (150) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for "pointing." Points are awarded for certified ill-health, and if the applicant's health is affected by his living conditions the Public Health Department investigates these conditions and in many instances is able to get them remedied. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 60 (114) No. of upper rooms closed 5 (2) No. of mews premises closed 5 (1) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders in lieu of demolition orders 1 0) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted - (-) Twenty-five (10) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing Orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on 95 (100) basement rooms. Fifty-eight (69) other basement rooms were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. New Accommodation During the year the Council completed eighty-two (10) new flats at— Pickering House—26 Flats Macroom House—12 Flats Cuthbert House—26 Flats Fermoy House—8 Flats Campbell House—10 Flats Housing Act, 1961 In my last report I referred to this new logislation which became operative on the 24th November, 1961. Part II of the Act gave local authorities new and stronger powers, introduced to deal with unsatisfactory living conditions in houses in multiple occupation. This has for years been a paramount problem in West London in general, and Paddington in particular, where over-occupation of large houses, deficient in amenities associated with a reasonable sanitary existence, has been steadily increasing. 33 It was apparent from the outset that difficulties in the implementation of the new powers would be experienced; not the least being the public health inspectors' staff shortages, which at the end of the year was three below establishment. It was decided that the first phase of assessing the potential of the new Act should be the inspection of a few properties in various parts of the Borough as "samples" of what might be expected in that particular district. Seventeen such houses were considered, each on its individual merit in relation to the practical application of all available legislation that could be used to improve conditions and ensure a reasonable standard of living for the occupants. As an initial step the owners were approached informally and acquainted of the matters needing attention. The results were reasonably encouraging, as in seven cases satisfactory proposals were made and accepted; four houses were being sold and negotiations were still proceeding with the new owners; and in the case of another four, discussions with the owners preceded informal action which would be pursued if necessary. With regard to the two remaining properties, it was thought that formal action might be indicated, and it was suggested that an estimate of the costs of the work should be obtained and considered in relation to the net income the owners were deriving from the house lettings. It was not intended that this should be the usual practice but as the two houses in question were in an area containing some 700 others, similar in structure and design, the information would be of value not only in respect of these houses but also would provide useful information for the future. The second phase of the work commenced towards the end of the year and will be covered in detail in my 1963 report. It consists of a house to house survey in the north of the Borough starting in Portnall Road. This area was selected as it contained a large number of houses multiply occupied, similar in age and character, and with an anticipated lengthy "life" as sound and useful dwellings. It became clear that one Inspector would have to be detailed to carry out this specialised work in the interests of consistency, and although this has been done it has caused an area in the south of the Borough to be depleted by one District Inspector. With the object of obtaining a measure of uniformity in London in the application of the new powers contained in Section 15 of the Act, the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee recommended the adoption of the standards suggested in the Joint Report of the Advisory Body of Town Clerks and Medical Officers of Health and these standards were accepted by Paddington in October as a Code of Practice. Parliamentary expression and official memoranda emphasised that there should be flexibility in the requirements of the local authority and where special circumstances justify a modification of the Standards this should be accepted and each individual case dealt with on its merits. Where action is taken by this department a concurrent investigation is arranged by the Director of Housing to see that the requirements of Section 16 (Means of Escape in Case of Fire) are fulfilled. The close co-operation between inspecting officers and liaison with the London County Council where applicable is essential. 34 These are early days to pass judgment or, indeed, to give a sound appraisal on the usefulness of the Act as far as Paddington is concerned. It is very clear that this was one of the areas the Minister had in mind when formulating the powers, but first impressions indicate that a simpler and more readily implemented legislation would make a more immediate impact on the situation. However, the ensuing year should provide a clearer basis for assessment. I can report so far that experience gained and information obtained from inspections indicate the following:— 1. That a high proportion of single room lettings, mostly furnished, are deficient in amenities and require attention. The service of a notice under Section 15 of the 1961 Act in these cases could produce one or other of the following consequences:— (i) It may inspire proposals from the owners suggesting amendments to some of the items included in the notices as served, and this may include a decision to reduce the number of existing lettings resulting in a number of families being displaced and in need of rehousing. (ii) Some owners who are enjoying large rentals from the lettings may consider the expense relative to the works required justified and comply with the notice in full. (iii) The owner may be unresponsive, and leave the local authority with no alternative but to carry out the works in default and recover the costs in the manner prescribed. In connection with both (ii) and (iii) above, whether the works are carried out by the owner or the Borough Council in the owner's default, the result could be that multiple occupation of these very small units of accommodation may be perpetuated irrespective of whether or not it is the most advantageous long term manner of occupation. 2. That the premises so far inspected in multiple occupation have been found, in the main, to be in a reasonable state of structural repair but being deficient in amenities, would be more aptly dealt with under Section 15 of the 1961 Act than Section 9 of the 1957 Act (the "Repair" Section) because of the additional powers available in the former, in particular, personal washing facilities. This is unfortunate as the powers to recover the costs incurred by a local authority in carrying out work under the 1961 Act appear to suffer by comparison with the Act of 1957. 3. That there would most likely be some difficulty in applying Management Order procedure under the 1961 Act in isolation and enforcing the Regulations where services and amenities were used by too many people. It appears of doubtful practical value, in fact, to use the Management Order unless there are a reasonable sufficiency of amenities already, or a Notice under Section 15 requiring their provision. 4. That there is much value in the informal approach and discussions with the owner or his representative as a preliminary. This can reduce the necessity for the preparation of detailed specifications of work by the Council's officers and is imperative where alternative housing accommodation 35 is not readily available, since any re-arrangement of tenancies, etc., must be mutually accepted. It is also, of course, in the owner's own interest, as his overall plans for his property can be fully taken into consideration; and, if he owns more than one property, progressive schemes may well be more satisfactory to him and to the local authority in the long term. 5. Perhaps the most serious difficulty in a borough such as Paddington is the lack of alternative accommodation available, particularly in already overcrowded houses, resulting in the immediate implementation of the provisions of the Housing Act, 1957 or 1961 being almost impracticable. 6. The powers given in Section 19, by which a local authority may limit the number of individuals living in a house having regard to the existing amenities available, would seem to be more useful if more account could be taken of the family lettings, rather than individuals related to such amenities, and to apply a limit accordingly. RENT ACT, 1957.—Below is a table showing details of the applications during 1962 for certificates of disrepair under this Act together with the action taken thereon. Applications for certificates of disrepair— No. of applications for certificates 1 (7) No. of decisions not to issue certificates — (1) No. of decisions to issue certificates— (a) in respect of some but not all defects — (4) (b) in respect of all defects 1 (3) No. of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (2) No. of undertakings refused by Council under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (-) No. of certificates issued 1 (6) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year — (-) Applications for cancellation of certificates— Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 2 (7) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates — (4) Decisions by Council to cancel in spite of tenants' objections - (1) Certificates cancelled by Council 2 (5) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year — (-) TOWN PLANNING.—-Three hundred and fifty-two (340) applications under the Town and Country Planning Acts for the conversion and alteration of premises, change of use or continuation of consent were referred to the Department for examination and comment. LAND CHARGES.—Some 1,764 (1,837) enquiries on matters in connection with the registered statutory charges under the Land Charges Act, 1952 were dealt with by the Department during the year. 36 APPENDIX Report of the Public Analyst (J. H. E. Marshall, M.A. F.R.I.C.) for the year ended 31st December, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year under review the number of samples submitted for examination was 500. Of these 486 were obtained under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 and 14 were complaint samples. In all 16 samples were irregular and were the subject of special reports. Most of the food and drugs samples examined were quite satisfactory and again it may be concluded that the wide variety of articles available to the general public and sampled by your Inspectors were of good quality. However, there are many articles of food which do need constant supervision by your Analyst and these include open meat products such as sausages and faggots; milk; spirits; and popular remedies with which people even in these days are still prone to dose themselves, such as sal volatile. All the 121 milk samples examined were quite satisfactory. The vast bulk of milk available in the Borough is produced by large firms who exercise stringent control over their products and the composition of the milk is thereby guaranteed. However, the checking of random samples by an independent analyst is fully justified. Of all the bottles of milk distributed in the Borough, every one which is not satisfactory is going to be the subject of a complaint by the customer. During the year four such bottles of milk were examined because of the presence of foreign matter, which was cement in two cases, a pad of fungus, and lastly the 'dirt' jeft behind by a firework having been exploded in the bottle. Complaints of the quality of bread because of the presence of foreign matter were also numerous, for the bread had yielded the following items;—a length of string, a piece of blue paper, an insect body and a lump of yeast. The remaining complaint samples consisted of cooked rice and a dinner alleged to have contained glass, a sample of chive dressing which was alleged to be unsatisfactory, samples of an eclair and a doughnut where the cream was alleged to be rancid and a bun which was alleged to have been eaten by mice. In this last instance the bun was of a very sticky kind and stuck to anything with which it came into contact. This left it with an uneven surface which at first view suggested that it had been eaten by mice, but examination showed that this was not the case. Five of the samples obtained under the Food and Drugs Act were not satisfactory. Four contravened the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order and the other contained a dead beetle. The potency of some vitamin capsules was not declared, a sample of instant coffee did not declare the ingredients, a sample of canned peas was not properly labelled and a sample of canned mixed vegetables was not properly labelled. The ingredients in a can of 37 vegetables packed in the United Kingdom need not be disclosed. But if the canners do not avail themselves of the exemptions in the Labelling of Food Order, then surely they are obliged to comply with its requirements. In this case the canners declared alternative ingredients thereby nullifying the fundamental principle of the Labelling of Food Order which requires the appearance on the wrapper of a true statement of the contents. A voluntary declaration of ingredients should be just as accurate as an obligatory declaration. The year 1962 saw the introduction of six or seven new regulations concerning the quality of food and drugs. The Orders issued dealt with the following matters:—The Emulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food Regulations, 1962, controls the use of such articles in quite a comprehensive manner. Their use in milk is prohibited by the Milk and Dairies (Emulsifiers and Stabilisers) Regulations, 1962. The position with regard to legal proceedings was clarified by the Food and Drugs (Legal Proceedings) Regulations, 1962 and by the Milk and Dairies (Legal Proceedings) Regulations, 1962. Regulations were made for amending the standards for table Jellies. Probably the most far reaching of the regulations made was one which drastically altered the Preservatives in Food Regulations, 1925. A far greater range of foods may now contain preservatives of a much greater variety. A maximum limit is set to the amount of preservative which is permitted. During 1962 was issued the Final Report of the Committee on Consumer Protection. Paragraph 9 of this report relates to food and drugs and says among other things " We found in the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provisions and powers of a most comprehensive nature. ... It is difficult to conceive of more farreaching provisions and powers than this Act contains for the protection of the consumer against unfit or deleterious food and drugs . . . the Ministers have the benefit of assistance from the Food Hygiene Advisory Council and of a Food Standards Committee, which now includes spokesmen for the consumer; and are, of course, answerable to Parliament for the manner in which they discharge their statutory duty . . . We say however, that we are unable to envisage a better system to handle the difficult and contentious issues which inevitably arise. We have not therefore given attention to problems which fall within the express or discretionary ambit of the Food and Drugs Act." The first Pure Food Act was made in 1860. Considerable progress has been made over one hundred years in the protection of the consumer over the vital matter of food and drugs and this is A summary of the samples analysed during the year is given below:— Drugs 19 Meat and Meat Products 41 Milks 121 Other Articles 319 500 38 the only class of merchandise which was not considered by the Moloney Committee, whose Report is referred to above. As the Regulations become more and more complex and detailed, greater attention is required in checking the various articles and in the enforcement of the statutory requirements. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. H. E. Marshall, Public Analyst. 39 Report of the Welfare Officer (Miss I. O. D. Harrison, S.S.D.) The year 1962 has undoubtedly been the most interesting and eventful since I took up my appointment with the Council in 1959. This of course was largely due to the introduction of the hotly debated Commonwealth Immigrants Bill, and the events preceding and following it. We still have no accqrate figures of newcomers in the Borough and, of course when we have the results of the 1961 Census they will show only the situation that existed at that time. Preliminary figures that have been published, however, do tell us that Paddington still has the highest density of all London Boroughs and the highest percentage of ratio of people to a room. During the first part of the year there was an explosive increase in the number of Commonwealth immigrants arriving in the Borough which meant that the number of problems brought to me increased enormously and became even more varied and complex. The influx was caused by a desire to get into the country before the restrictions of the Bill were applied. This had unfortunate, and sometimes even tragic repercussions, because while better educated and more skilled people did not need to panic because the Bill would not for them present such serious obstacles, people with fewer skills and lower education attainment were arriving, not having carefully examined the problems of uprooting themselves and having made hasty decisions only to find themselves in distressing situations when they arrived. Among these people were many, particularly from the less developed areas, who were completely bewildered by the complex society in which they found themselves, and in which they were expected to compete. I was frequently most impressed and even moved by the courage and determination with which many of them faced up to apparently insuperable difficulties. The problems besetting many such people were particularly acute because they had no financial cushion which allowed them even a brief period in which to become accustomed to their new surroundings before they were able to look for suitable work. The employment situation in the areas receiving the bulge quite naturally, deteriorated and suitable work became hard to come by. The already serious housing shortage was further aggravated by this situation. The newly arrived people desperately needed accommodation and had not yet had the opportunity to recognise the sharp practice and exploitation which was rife in respect of housing. The situation in some areas was quite shocking. Unscrupulous landlords were perpetually evicting unprotected tenants to take in new ones who they could fleece even further and as a result there were people constantly on the move and seeking somewhere to live. The newcomer has a variety of difficulties to surmount, more particularly if he is coloured, but the overwhelming majority of problems stem from shortage of accommodation and the consequential victimisation and exploitation. 40 This situation has repercussions which also affect the 'native' members of the community, particularly controlled tenants, many of whom have lived all their lives in the Borough. Unfortunately this still gives rise to misunderstanding and friction. Social workers and officials in the district are aware that we have been plagued by unsatisfactory landlords and property owners for many years, but over the last few years another type of' landlord menace ' has arisen. This is because some people in urgent need of accommodation have been compelled by the shortage of rented accommodation at economic rents to buy property beyond their means and which very often is unsuitable or even inadequate for their own needs. The Council have continued to give helpful advice to would-be purchasers and grant loans for house purchase, conversion and alterations in accordance with the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. (Amended 1959.) Unfortunately, however, there are would-be purchasers who do not have the necessary qualifications to be eligible for loans, and who despite advice, buy undesirable, unsuitable properties at inflated prices. So frequently these people obtain loans from the less desirable societies or agents who are only too ready to grant them at exorbitant rates of interest. Thus, in order to make their investment as profitable as possible, sometimes even in order to meet their commitments, and in some cases in an attempt to make sufficient money to buy something better, many of these landlords are letting off all the rooms they can possibly spare at high rents, with limited facilities and so many restrictions that their tenants live under perpetual strain and also perpetual fear of eviction. Protected tenants in such properties are bitterly resented and so often everything possible is done to persuade them to move, even to the extent of petty persecution. There are always problems in introducing legislation, primarily to see that it is all embracing, and secondly to see that it does not create more problems than it resolves. The laws relating to housing are no exception, and are sometimes powerless to control the increasing exploitation and sharp practice which the shortage inevitably invites. This is very largely because certain legislation can only be effective with the co-operation of the exploited tenant, but as he knows that eviction is certain if he protests, he will keep quiet about it. Rent Tribunals are loaded with work, but yet there are many cases not referred to them because, again, the result might be eviction. Not only have such problems taken up an enormous amount of my time, but the situation is discouraging, bccause as a sociologist I am concerned with the development of stable family life, but more particularly because the long term purpose of my particular function is to assist newcomers in the development of stable family life, as units, within the community as a whole. It is generally agreed that the success of our efforts will be reflected tomorrow in the children of today, but how can we expect these citizens of tomorrow to understand and emulate something they are not having the opportunity of experiencing, a permanent home, unbroken school attendance, and opportunities of making 41 permanent neighbours, permanent friends and developing bonds of affection. There are many cases where children are changing their address several times in the course of a year. I was heartened to find that during the last year there appeared to have been fewer cases of friction between landlord and tenant involving coloured and white people, and hoped that this indicated a greater degree of tolerance and understanding. However, unhappily I also noted that misunderstanding and friction between landlord and tenant, and between tenants where both parties are coloured increased. In my report of last year I expressed the fear that certain areas were tending to develop into racial areas. Unfortunately, this trend has not halted. This may be the explanation of the situation described above. The number of marital and extra marital problems brought to my attention increased. It is becoming more generally understood why there are differences in attitude towards marriage, sexual relationships and raising families between some migrant people and people among whom they have come to live. These differences are rooted in the social history of the districts from whence many of our new citizens come. I should make it quite clear I am not talking about promiscuity or immorality, but the behaviour that is accepted as normal. Nevertheless, these different social patterns do produce complex difficulties when we are trying to fit them into our pattern of social behaviour and the legislation that goes with it. While unions not sanctified and protected by marriage can produce stable and happy family units within a smaller and less complex community, where social sanctions and custom completely accept this, and itself exercises the necessary protection and control, they can produce much hardship and misery in a city like London. It was to be anticipated that attitudes and customs would not change overnight, and given that they did, marriage would not necessarily solve all the problems right away, because previous personal histories might mean that there would be other ties and children of other unions living with other family units—sometimes not even in the same country as the mother or father. It was also to be expected that as newcomers are like any other group of individuals, there would be among them some men who would be prepared to take advantage of the customs of their homeland, but who, at the same time, would quickly appreciate that in a city of this size it would be easier to evade responsibility. I appreciate that these are teething troubles, but this does not mean we can allow time to take care of them, because there are children being born under these circumstances, and these children are defenceless and do not have the protection, care, understanding or approval that they would normally have in the homelands of their parents. The attitude of some of the men towards women is still foreign to our own and the women who must be the vanguard of the attack on this situation appear still to be so submissive that in fact they are encouraging the men to carry on in the old way rather than accept a more egalitarian attitude towards them. 42 Extremely complicated and involved problems are certain to arise from the situation I have described, which is why, at the risk of being unpopular with the menfolk, I am using my efforts to ' emancipate ' such women and encourage them to insist on making the men conform, and realise that their womenfolk are their social equals. Although there is little drama attached to their work, the various Committees and groups which were set up specifically to assist in tackling the problems of integration and for the promotion of understanding and friendship between newcomers and ourselves when problems first began to appear, continue to function and with the same enthusiasm and efficiency. These Committees and groups are comprised of Councillors and other well known people in the Borough, professional people in various fields, and people who are not at all well known, but whose contributions are not only extremely valuable but very much appreciated. I am grateful for the continued and unfailing help and cooperation I have received from officials of the London County Council, members of our own Paddington Borough Council and members of the Police Force. I am also grateful for the co-operation and assistance I have received from Mr. and Mrs. Jewiss of Beauchamp Lodge, and from Mrs. Thirlwell. I would particularly like to pay tribute to the workers at the Citizens' Advice Bureau, who have such heavy demands made on their services. Naturally I could not conclude without again expressing my appreciation of the help and courtesy extended to me by Dr. Oldershaw and members of his Staff in the Public Health Department. 43 The Ministry of Health has requested that the following figures regarding factories and outworkers should be annexed to the Annual Report.
