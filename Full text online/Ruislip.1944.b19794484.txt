It is not known whether these patients had been immunised. The remaining three cases occurred in girls of 5, 9 and 18 yrs. , none of Whom had been immunised. - 7 - 1 2 SMALLPOX The outbreak of Smallpox in this district originated from an Officer patient admitted to Mount Vernon Hospital on February 6th from the Middle East. By the 2nd March seven contacts had developed the disease. By the 18th March five more cases were reported in the London area. 3 deaths occurred. Altogether in the Ruislip-Northwood district seven cases of Smallpox occurred. All these were admitted to the London County Council Isolation Hospital at Clandon. Vaccination depots were set up at NorthWood First Aid Post and Dawlish Drive Health Centre, as well as at the Public Health Offices in Northwood. Vaccine from the Government Lymph Establishment at Hendon was supplied to all medical practitioners in the district on application. The arrangements worked smoothly, there was no panic, and our thanks are due to the residents of the district for having kept their heads and sacrificed their limbs so readily to the discomforts of vaccination. Thanks are also due to the Public Vaccinator and the Medical Practitioners for the valuable work they did at this time. Contacts notified for supervision 63 Number of visits by Sanitary Inspectors 250 This necessitaged much hard work on the part of Sanitary Inspectors and clerical staff, some of which was overtime, for which I am sincerely grateful. Visits by myself were undertaken as and when necessary. Four suspicious cases were also visited at the request of the practitioners in the district. One of these proved to be a case of Smallpox, and was immediately admitted to the Isolation Hospital. Two of the others were vaccinia rashes and the other a case of Chicken-pox. Two Medical Officers from the Ministry of Health and one from the County Council supervised and co-operated with myself in combatting the spread of the disease, and both the Council and myself fully realise the invaluable assistance which they gave at this time, which, without doubt, was one of the main factors in stamping out the epidemic. The district was considered free of infection and out of quarantine by the end of March. Scabies. Arrangements have been made with Mount Vernon Hospital for the diagnosis and treatment of Scabies. Patients may attend at 10 a.m. every Tuesday.
