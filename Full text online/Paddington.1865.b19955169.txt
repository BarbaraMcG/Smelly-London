Vestry Hall, Harrow Road; 14th July, 1866. SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 18 6 5-66. BY J. BURDON-SANDERSON, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Assistant Physician to Middlesex Hospital, and to the Hospital for Consumption. medical officer of health. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; July, 1866. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the usual Annual Summary of the measures in operation during the year terminating last Lady Day, for the promotion of the health of the Parish. In the year ending December 31st, 1365, 492 Orders for the improvement of houses or for the removal of nuisances were issued by the Sanitary Committee. Of these, 433 have been complied with, while the rest have been transferred to the list for 1866. The proceedings relating to Nos. 29—48 North Wharf Road, referred to in my annual reports for 1863 and 1864 which were deferred last year in consequence of the alleged poverty of the owner, have not yet been brought to a conclusion. On 12 the 21 st of September the attention of the Sanitary Committee was again called to the unwholesome condition of these houses; it was stated that they were drained in a combined manner by a drain in rear—that the drain itself and the branches leading into it were insufficient—that the premises were in such a state as to endanger the health of the inhabitants—and that these evils could only be remedied by the reconstruction of the whole system of drainage. I was thereupon authorized "to act in respect of the matter under the advice of the Vestry Solicitor," and in order that any further proceedings taken by the Vestry might be based on unquestionable evidence, the Surveyor was instructed to inspect the drain. The ground having been opened for this purpose, it was found that the structural condition of the drain was precisely such as it had been first stated to be in my annual report for 1863, and on various subsequent occasions. The Vestry Solicitor having advised (November 2nd) as to the best course of proceeding, and the Sanitary Committee having also consulted Mr. Merry, formerly Surveyor of Sewers, as to the most efficient and economical mode of carrying out the required works, finally directed (December 7th) that a draft of the necessary order relating to one ot the houses, No. 48, should be prepared by the Solicitor, which having been approved by the Committee on the 15th of February, received the sanction of the Vestry on the 20th of the same 13 month. The proceedings since taken with respect to the other houses will be recorded in my next annual statement. Several times during the year the Sanitary Committee have directed their attention to the defective drainage of Alfred Road, Waverley Road, and Orchard Street. The houses in all these streets are drained on the same plan as those in North Wharf Road above referred to; the drainage of each house being received by a main pipe-drain, which passes beneath its back yard, instead of being conveyed forwards into a sewer in front. On the 6th of April I reported that in consequence of the obstruction of the main drain near its outlet, the yards and forecourts of a number of houses were flooded with sewage, and that the same evil had occurred to my knowledge several times previously, to the great detriment of the health of the inhabitants. The matter was then referred to the Surveyor for a report as to the works necessary for the improvement of the drainage. This officer having expressed his opinion that in order to remedy the evil effectually it would be necessary to construct new sewers in each of the streets in question, it was resolved to refer the matter to the Highway Committee. No steps having been taken with respect to it, it was again brought under the notice of the Sanitary Committee on the 21st of September, in 14 quence of an obstruction of the drainage similar to that which had occurred in April. It appearing that there was some doubt whether, if new sewers were constructed, the owners of houses could be compelled to drain into them, this question was referred to the Vestry Solicitor, who on the 21st of December stated that in his opinion they could be so compelled, and could also be required to pay the expenses of the sewers constructed. Having arrived at this point, the Sanitary Committee again referred the matter to the Highway Committee, who, on the 25th of January, 1866, ordered that estimates should be prepared. During the year, the Sanitary Inspector was authorized to make complaint at the Police Court in fifteen instances, In seven of these cases the nuisances complained of were abated on notice of proceedings. Of the remainder, three related to defective drainage, five to defective ventilation. The proceedings taken were as follows : On the 12th of June, a Summons was granted against the Owner of 14, Harrow Road. At the hearing on the t4th he was ordered to reconstruct the drain of his house and pay the costs of the Summons. On the 21st of December it was reported to the Sanitary Committee that the house 2, Church Place was not only dilapidated, but in so foul a state as to be a nuisance, and that moreover 15 pigs were kept in one of the rooms on the basement. The case was heard on the 20th of January, and adjourned for the completion of the works until the 3rd of February, when it appeared that the requirements of the Sanitary Committee had been carried out by the defendant. On the 18th of January the Inspector was directed to make complaint against the Owner of 15, Church Place, in respect of the foul and unwholesome state of his house. On the representation of the Owner that the nuisance was not due to any defect in his own drain, but to leakage from that of his neighbour, the proceedings were deferred in order that the drain supposed to be defective, might be inspected and, if necessary, amended. This having been done, and it having appeared that the nuisance in 15, Church Place still continued, complaint was again made on the 27th of March. At the hearing the defendant failed to appear, whereupon a new summons was granted. At the second hearing on 7th of April, the defendant gave an undertaking in writing that he would carry out the required works, whereupon a second adjournment was granted till the 14th. On that day the defendant again failed to appear. It having been proved that he had not carried out the works, the Magistrate made an order requiring him to construct from his house into the sewer in front a six-inch stoneware pipe-drain in such a manner as to be satisfactory to the Sanitary Committee, who were empowered 16 in default, to do the required works at his expense. This order having been disregarded by the Owner, it was carried into effect by the Sanitary Committee on the 7th of June. On the 2nd of November I reported on the unwholesome condition of certain dwellings in Carlton Place and Andover Place, to which my attention had been specially directed in consequence of an outbreak of smallpox in those localities. The disease had been fatal to several persons, and its extension seemed to be in great measure attributable to defective ventilation. It appeared that the houses in question had originally been constructed for stables, and that in some of them only half of the inhabited rooms were provided with windows, the rest being furnished with no adequate means either of lighting or ventilation. None of the houses having either backyard or forecourt it had been necessary to place the water-closets, wash-houses and sinks in the interior, from which arrangement, combined with the absence of provision for ventilation, the internal atmosphere was so offensive that no one unaccustomed to foul odours could remain in it. Having prepared a detailed statement of the works necessary for the improvement of these premises, I suggested that immediate steps should be taken for their enforcement. Accordingly, the Sanitary Committee instructed the Inspector to make 17 complaint under the direction of the Vestry Solicitor. The proceedings were commenced on the 20th of February, and are still pending. They have led to a material improvement in the Sanitary condition of the houses in question, but it is to be regretted that some of the most important requirements of the Committee have not yet been complied with. Canal Basin. On the 4th of May I was instructed by the Sanitary Committee to write to the Directors of the Grand Junction Canal Company, requesting to be informed "what measures the Company were prepared to take for preventing the evil consequences likely to ensue from the foul condition of the Basin." In reply, the Directors expressed their willingness to take the necessary steps, proposing either to change the water or to employ some mode of disinfection. At the same time the subject was brought by the Sanitary Committee under the notice of the Vestry, when it was resolved (May 16th) "That the Sanitary Committee be empowered to resort to the proper legal remedies." In order to give effect to this resolution the Vestry Solicitor received instructions to confer with the Directors, and it was also thought advisable that I should take part in the conference, which was fixed for the 19th of May. I then stated that in 18 the opinion of the Vestry the nuisance was owing to three causes, viz.: (1) To the complete stagnancy of the water, in consequence of which its impurity and putrescence gradually increase during the summer months; (2) To the carelessness of the wharfingers and bargemen, either in allowing soakage from their wharves, or in spilling offensive matter while loading their barges; and (3) To the constant discharge from the barges into the Basin of bilge water, night soil and other descriptions of filth. I added that in the opinion of the Vestry these evils could only be remedied by the adoption of the following measures; (l)To renew the water every year at least three times during the Summer months; (2) To make and enforce on all persons carrying on trade in manure or other offensive matters, and on all bargemen, such regulations as regards the construction of their barges and landing places as are necessary to prevent the spilling or soakage above referred to, and to prohibit the discharge of soil, bilge water or other offensive liquids into the Basin. Of the two proposals made by the Directors in reply to my letter of the 4th of May, I expressed a decided opinion that the changing of the water was in every respect preferable to the employment of any means of disinfection. It was finally agreed that both measures should be adopted. As however the supply of water did not permit of the Basin being emptied earlier than the 3rd of June, orders were 19 given that ten tons of powdered chalk lime should be at once introduced into the water and scattered over its surface.* On the 4th of June the Basin was emptied, and remained empty for two days. It was found that the depth of the mud did not exceed a few inches in any part, except in the neighbourhood of the bridge, so that the condition of the channel was satisfactory, as compared with former years. The improvement in the health of the surrounding inhabitants, and particularly of the families of the bargemen, consequently on the removal of the water, was marked. During the few weeks which immediately preceded the admission of fresh * When fresh lime is added to water like that of the Canal Basin in which a good deal of carbonate of lime in the soluble state is dissolved, it enters into chemical combination with the carbonate, so as to form insoluble carbonate of lime, or chalk. This, as soon as it is formed, falls to the bottom, carrying with it any impurities which happen to be suspended in the water; so that by adding more lime to water already containing a certain quantity, both that which is added and that which previously existed are got rid of. The advantage to be gained by the process does not however lie in the removal of the lime, but of the light matters which it carries down with it; for this reason it is an effectual method of disinfection, provided that the channel is clean and the water remains tranquil; but if the bottom consists of organic mud which is frequently agitated, the floating putrescible matters are so abundant and so rapidly replaced after removal that the effect of liming must be very inconsiderable. 20 water, alvine disorders prevailed almost universally; but on the 26th of June, although the weather was much warmer, no case of diarrhoea existed in 85 boats then lying in the Basin, occupied by 187 persons, including 42 children. As however it was evident to the Vestry that although the offensiveness of the water had been somewhat diminished, the evils so long complained of were likely to recur, and moreover that the Directors had complied with only one of their requirements, and that in a partial manner, it was resolved to instruct the Vestry Solicitor to take the opinion of Counsel as to the best mode of proceeding; and a Sub-Committee was appointed to co-operate with him in the matter. Acting on the advice given by Counsel, the Sub-Committee recommended that at the first moment that the Canal Basin should become unusually impure, the Vestry should at once proceed to indict the Company for the nuisance permitted by them therein. While these measures were in progress, several Memorials were received, relating either to the noxious state of the Basin itself, or to the nuisances connected with it. One of these was signed by the most influential traders on the Basin; another by the Governors of St. Mary's Hospital. In the latter, which was addressed to the Lords of Her Majesty's Privy Council, and by them referred to the Vestry, it was alleged that the 21 emanations proceeding either from the water, or from the offensive accumulations on the wharves, seriously interfered with the welfare of the patients, and that in particular in the surgical practice of the hospital, the contamination of the air induced a liability to erysipelas and pyaemia after severe injuries and operations, whereby the chances of recovery of the unfortunate sufferers were materially diminished. Removal of Manure. The steps taken by the Vestry, as related in my last report (p.p. 22, 23) for restraining the undue detention of offensive matter on the wharves, have led to satisfactory results; so much so, that during the last six months, the deposit of manure on the premises of the manure dealers adjoining the Canal Basin has been for the most part put a stop to. Unfortunately the restrictions which have brought about this desirable result, have reacted unfavourably in interfering with the prompt removal of manure from the Mewses. The complaints which have been received on this subject have exceeded in number those of any former year, and there appears to be every reason to anticipate that they will continue to increase until the Vestry are empowered by some more efficient enactment than that which at present exists, to undertake the control of this traffic. 22 This object would obviously be best attained by the adoption of similar arrangements with reference to manure to those which are now in operation for the removal of dust. Slaughter-houses and Cow-houses. On the 5th of October I presented to the Sanitary Committee my usual report as to the condition of the Slaughter-houses and Cow-houses in the Parish. With reference to the Slaughter-houses it was stated, that although they were all in fair condition as regards drainage, paving and the like, several of them were in crowded situations, been surrounded by inhabited buildings on all sides. Those situated at 108, Star Street, 11, Harrow Road, 77, Westbourne Park Road, 13, Westbourne Terrace North, 7, Old Church Street, and in Jonson's Mews, were referred to as examples. Considering however that all of these were well constructed and properly ventilated, I recommended that the renewal of the licences should not be opposed. But as regards the Cow-houses, there were several in respect of which the grounds of objection were so strong, that it did not appear to me expedient to allow their continuance. Thus I 23 reported that a large stable, used as a cow shed at 64, Market Street, having a capacity of about 4600 cubic feet-that is 516 feet for each cow, was objectionable as being situated in a populous neighbourhood and adjoining an inhabited house, one of the rooms of which was above the cow-shed. In three other instances it was recommended that the applications should be opposed on grounds of a similar nature, viz.: in respect of the premises No. 14, Bristol Mews, Nos. 1, 13 and 14, Blomfield Mews, and 16, Westbourne Park Villas Mews. At the Special Sessions, held on the 30th October, the four applications above referred to were refused. In another case it appeared that the buildings in respect of which application was made, although at a distance from inhabited dwellings, and therefore in a suitable situation for the purpose intended, were altogether without drainage. Here I recommended that the renewal of a licence should be opposed conditionally, and that notice should be given to the occupier to provide proper drainage, and to carry out other necessary constructive improvements. The licence was accordingly suspended for a month, in order that the applicant might have time to complete these requirements. At the second hearing the application was finally refused, it appearing to the Magistrates, after personal inspection of the premises, that the works 24 had not been carried out in a satisfactory manner. Three other applications, although not objected to by the Vestry, were refused by the Magistrates on various important grounds. On the 16th of February I reported to the Sanitary Committee that several of the occupiers of Cow-sheds, whose licences had been withdrawn, continued to keep cows on their premises; and recommended that the fact should be brought under the notice of the Chief Commissioner of Police, by whose orders proceedings were subsequently taken for the enforcement of the penalties. The unlawful occupation has in each instance been discontinued. 1 have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. BURDON-SANDERSON. TABLE I.

STEVENS, surveyor. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; June 3Oth, 1866. Gentlemen, In compliance with the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act 1855, I beg to lay before you a Report of Works executed during the year ending March 25th, 1866:— Paving. Footways have been widened and re-paved with new three-inch Yorkshire Paving, and others formerly repaired with Gravel have been flagged throughout. The edges of several Gravel Footways have been protected by a Granite Kerb. The Crossings of Streets in fourteen places have been paved with suitable stones. Eighteen additional Streets, or portions of Streets, have been cleansed, watered and repaired, which with the previously existing Streets, make 37 miles and 147 yards now under the jurisdiction of the Vestry. 32 Thirteen New Streets, or portions of Streets, have been formed and paved under the powers of the Metropolis Management Acts of 1855 and 1862, at the cost of the Owners of Property. The number of openings made by Gas and Water Companies and others in the Streets, and which have been reinstated at their expense, amount to 2264. Lighting. Twenty additional Lamps have been erected in various parts of the Parish, making a total of 1478. Twenty-eight Lamps have been removed to new positions where Footways required to be widened, and in Streets requiring additional Lamps for the better lighting thereof. Buildings, Sewers and Drains. Twenty-eight Notices have been given to the Vestry for the erection of 166 Buildings, namely, 96 Houses and 70 Stables, in accordance with the 76 Section of the Act of 1855. Seventy-three applications for the re-construction of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways, to 113 Houses and Premises, have been received and the Works executed at the expense of Owners of Property. 33 Sewers in the undermentioned Streets and Places have been constructed by the Owners of Property at their expense. ft. ft. in. ft. in.

BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Population of Paddington, April, 1861 75,807. Vestry Hall; May, 1865. During the six months terminating April 1st, the mortality of London was exceedingly high: 6.6 per thousand of the population died during the quarter ending December 31, and 7.0 per thousand during the quarter following. Paddington did not participate in this unhealthiness, for the corresponding rates for the same quarters were respectively 4.7 and 4.9. In the metropolis generally, the relative numbers expressing the mortality from fever alone in the two quarters were severally 36 and 31: in Paddington they were 17 and 5. The Epidemics in Russia and North Germany.—It is now a month since the public mind was agitated by the news that the "Siberian Pest" had broken out on the banks of the Neva and was steadily making its way to this country, and that a new and hitherto unheard of malady had appeared on the Southern shores of the Baltic. The first of these rumours was soon known to be groundless, for even the imperfect descriptions which first reached us, were sufficiently complete to enable those who were well acquainted with diseases of this nature to recognize that even in its most severe form the plague of St. Petersburg was essentially the same as the contagious fever which has existed in London during the last three years, and that its tendency to relapse and all its other frightful characteristics had been in former times observed in Great Britain —more particularly during the epidemic which prevailed among the half-fed rural population of Ireland in 1847, when the failure of the potato crop produced famine, and famine, pestilence. The popular fear lest the Russian fever should reach England was strengthened by the report that the disease had already spread to Dantzic and other places on the Baltic. To this it was added that in its migration to Germany it had assumed, in addition to the contagiousness of plague, the horrible characteristics of tetanus-a disease hitherto scarcely known, excepting as an occasional consequence of certain surgical injuries, or as the effect of poisoning by strychnia. To observe and describe the new disease in the district in which it was most fatal, and to report on the means most proper to be taken for preventing its communication to this country, I was instructed to proceed to Germany at a few hours notice. The main results of my journey, may be shortly stated as follows:— Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis is a disease practically unknown to the medical profession in this country, and has therefore no English name. In Germany it was also unknown until two years ago, since which time it has been met with in that country in various places at great distances from each other. It has received there a name which describes its most striking, (though perhaps not its most important) symptom—Genickkrampf. The following are its main features.—The patient is suddenly seized with shivering, dreadful head-ache and vomiting; these having continued a few hours, the head is drawn back by muscular contraction, and the sufferer becomes violently delirious—uttering in his wanderings cries of pain. In a day or two the delirium subsides, and the patient either becomes comatose and dies, or passes into a state of stupor which may last for days, or even for weeks. In its essential nature the disease is a rapidly progressing inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, more particularly of the latter. Spontaneous (or as it is called, idiopathic) inflammation of the spinal cord is a disease so rare as to be almost unknown. When it is produced by injury or other accidental causes, it is accompanied with symptoms resembling those of the epidemic disease, but not so violent. As regards the local and personal conditions which lead to its prevalence, it resembles diphtheria much more than any other of the so-called zymotic diseases. It shews no preference for the over-crowded courts and alleys of populous towns, but is as often met with in remote villages and lone farm houses. It has very little tendency to spread by personal intercourse, in consequence of which the area of its prevalence is usually restricted within narrow limits. As the disease has already appeared in America, and in every continental country excepting Russia, it may probably come to England sooner or later. If it were to appear, the only effectual preventive would be to circulate the most complete information as to the symptoms by which it may be recognized at its commencement. For although it is entirely incapable of being successfully treated in its later stages, there seems good reason for believing that during the first few hours its progress may be arrested, and that if the doctor is called in time, life may be saved. In the recent epidemic, children died by hundreds during the first few weeks, because the disease was not recognized. Afterwards when it became more familiar, the peasants learnt to put in practice the necessary remedies, even before medical advice could be obtained. That any epidemic disease, and especially typhus fever, should be more fatal in St. Petersburg than in London can scarcely be matter of surprise to us. Indeed, if it were otherwise, we should be compelled to admit that the fundamental notions on which our efforts for sanitary improvement are founded, are erroneous, and that the sacrifices we have made to render our capital the most healthy of modern towns, have been useless. In St. Petersburg it seems as if art and nature had combined to render the place unhealthy. It is situated on a marsh, and at all times subject to those diseases which are called malarious. Two hundred years ago London was in a similar condition, but now by the extension of agriculture, the intermittent fevers, which were so destructive in the days of the Stuarts, have dwindled into the agues and quotidian neuralgias of our time. But pernicious intermittents are not the only evils which St. Petersburg owes to its situation. To drain a town built on a swamp would be exceedingly difficult, and in fact the Russian capital is without sewers; the foulness of the town is collected in iron tubs, and conveyed away on trucks, which discharge their contents into the Neva at a point higher up the stream than the town itself. To this it is to be added that the common people drink the water of the river without filtration, that there is much over-crowding, as well as personal and domestic uncleanliness, and lastly that the diet of the poor is insufficient in quantity, and is composed principally of black rye bread and potatoes. In 1860 the salubrity of London induced certain sanguine persons to hope that fever had disappeared from the metropolis, and that the diseases of zymotic origin had lost their virulence. Since that time we have had a succession of unhealthy years, which have shewn us how much they were mistaken. Wherever over-crowding has been permitted, or the dwellings of the poor have been allowed to become foul and dilapidated—wherever drainage has been neglected, and the poisonous air of the sewers has found its way into the houses—there, fever has shewn itself to be quite as formidable as it was twenty years ago, when these evils were much less exceptional than they are now. The reasons why fever-nests exist in London are not difficult to point out. The districts from which the wards of the fever hospital have been filled, have been those in which there has been no systematic house to house visitation of the streets inhabited by the poor, and where the duties of Inspector are limited to the investigation of such aggravated nuisances, as may happen to be made the subject of complaint. It may be stated as a fundamental rule of sanitary administration that every house let in holdings of single rooms ought to be visited at least once a year, and those which are most apt to be over-crowded, more frequently. Day by day I become more and more convinced of the portance of this principle, but I have to regret that my efforts to carry it out with regularity have not been quite so successful as I could wish. In addition to the systematic measures which are necessary to combat overcrowding, domestic foulness and bad drainage, we have to wage an unrelenting warfare against what may be called standing nuisances. Among these the Canal Basin is still pre-eminent. During the last few weeks the water has become most offensive. In consequence of the warm weather it was as black at the end of April as it usually is by Whitsuntide. Foul and pernicious gases are constantly bubbling up from the putrescent deposits with which the channel is covered, and poisoning the neighbourhood. Year after year complaints in great numbers are received during the summer of the offensive smells arising from untrapped gully grates, and other openings by which the underground atmosphere of the sewers communicates with the external air. As it is necessary, in the absence of any other means of ventilation, that openings of this kind should exist in the streets, this evil cannot be altogether got rid of. But it may be in great measure counteracted by the employment of proper methods of disinfection. Of these methods I believe none to be so good as that which was employed in this Parish in 1858 and 1859 —namely the introduction into the sewers of a quantity of thin milk of lime with the addition of the antiseptic liquid manufactured by Mr. Mr. Dougall. Since that period this plan has been largely employed both in London and elsewhere, and has been found everywhere to produce the most satisfactory and lasting results. It has this immense advantage, that the chemical compound to which the disinfectant owes its power, so far from being injurious like some other substances used for the same purpose, acts when diffused in the air as a tonic, promoting digestion and increasing the appetite. ANALYSES OF PADDINGTON WATERS. During the last three months the water supplied to the inhabitants of this Parish by the two Water Companies, has been subjected to analysis. The following are the results:— Date. Jan. 5. Names of the Water Companies. Solid Matter in One Pint of Water- Inorganic matter (in grains). Organic matter (in grains). Grand Junction 2.838 0.308 - West Middlesex 2.793 0.338 April 7. Grand Junction 2.980 0.262 - West Middlesex 2.917 0.185 The above analyses have been performed in the laboratory of St. Thomas's Hospital by my friend Dr. Bernays, the water having been collected under my supervision for this purpose, and forwarded by order of the Vestry. So far as relates to impurities injurious to health, the results are entirely satisfactory, both as regards the quantity and quality of the solid constituents, for in all the analyses it was found that the organic matter was in an inactive state—by which expression is signified that it consisted mainly of those harmless constituents of plants of which all river-water contains a certain small proportion derived from the vegetable mould over which it flows. No evidence was found that any of the samples examined contained organic matter undergoing putrefactive change, such as would be met with if the water had been contaminated with sewage. The conclusion to be derived from these analyses is shortly this, that the water of the Thames as delivered by the Companies is practically free from contamination. Unfortunately in the houses of the poor this advantage is often lost in consequence of the foulness of the receptacles in which the water is stored. If it were possible, water-butts ought to be universally discarded; if they are used at all, they should be sound and good, and their inner surfaces should be charred, or well lined with pitch.

REPORT on the HEALTH OF PADDINGTON DURING THE HALF-YEAR ENDING MICHAELMAS, 1866, BY J. BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Population of Paddington, April, 1861 75,807. Vestry Hall; November, 1865. The half-year which has just terminated has been marked by events relating to the public health of an unusual character. Early in the spring, public attention was directed to the epidemics which were then ravaging the North of Europe, and danger was looked for from the shores of the Baltic. No sooner had the horizon cleared northwards, than the harbingers of another tempest appeared to the south-west, in the countries bordered by the Red Sea and the Levant. Cholera had sprung up in an unknown way among the crowds of pilgrims returning from the shrine of the Prophet, and had been carried by them to Alexandria and other places on the Delta of the Nile. The hope at first entertained that it would confine itself to the populations among which it originated was soon found to be groundless, for the eastern pestilence broke out in other more distant sea-ports on the shores of the Mediterranean,—not following any particular direction or order, but often appearing almost simultaneously in places at considerable distances from each other. During the last month the epidemic has assumed a much more alarming aspect. On the one hand it has prevailed very extensively in Paris, where it has destroyed about 4000 persons, while on the other it is gradually extending from the countries which adjoin the Black Sea, into Russia and Russian Poland,—thus embracing the whole of central Europe. The problem of the origin of cholera,—so important in relation to quarantine and other national measures of prevention—remains still unsolved, and a joint commission of representatives of all the European nations is now being organized to investigate it. But fortunately the uncertainty with which this question is surrounded does not extend to that of the causes by which the spread of the disease is promoted. Here all are pretty well agreed. Whether contagionists or non-contagionists,whether believing that the poison of cholera is conveyed to us in the water we drink or in the air we breathe,—that it is dependent on the absence of ozone or on some mysterious alteration of the "occult properties" of the atmosphere, all are willing to admit that its preference for particular localities is determined by the same well-known causes which induce diarrhoea—the contamination of air or water with putrescible impurities—and that the only reasonable thing to do, in anticipation of cholera, is to get rid of these evils. In the matter of water-supply, there can be do doubt that London is infinitely better off than it was either in 1849 or 1854, but as regards atmospheric impurity it is sad to think how little real good has been accomplished. It is true that we have a system of main-drainage, of which we may be justly proud, and sewers which are models of efficient construction, but nevertheless Londoners are scarcely less liable to be poisoned with sewer gases than they were ten years ago. Everywhere are to be found houses of which the drains are constructed of such permeable materials that the sewer air filters freely through them into the very sleeping rooms. Can it be doubted that if cholera comes it will find out 6uch houses, and that their occupants will suffer severely, unless in the mean time, the inadequate powers we possess for the reconstruction of house-drains can be stretched into more effectual exercise than has hitherto been found possible ? During the winter, the internal drainage of the houses is the one thing which ought to engage our attention. The abatement of overcrowding &nd the carrying out of improvements in respect of water-supply and ventilation, may with more shew of reason be deferred till the nearer approach of the enemy, but as regards reconstruction of drains, all must be done in the cold season. When summer comes the beat that can be done in this matter is to let ill alone, for the soil which surrounds dilapidated drains is so foul that it cannot be disturbed in hot weather without serious risk. Early in the autumn it was judged advisable by the Vestry to appoint an additional Inspector, who was instructed to devote himself to the systematic visitation of the houses inhabited by the poorer classes, with special reference to the enforcement of cleansing and lime-washing where necessary, and the removal of offensive accumulations. In this way 2843 houses have been visited during the last three months, in 154 of which sanitary improvements have been carried out, without reckoning those from which dust or other refuse has been removed.

REPORT OF THE SPECIAL HEALTH COMMITTEE. 186 6. Paddington. report OF THE SPECIAL HEALTH COMMITTEE. REPORT. The Special Public Health Committee beg to state to the Vestry the work in which they have been engaged, under the special powers entrusted to them, since their appointment. They believe that they cannot do this better than by incorporating in their statement the following Report laid before them at their last Meeting by the Medical Officer of Health: — During the six weeks ending the 15th of September, The Special Health Committee, which was appointed at the Vestry held on the 27th of July, has met weekly for the purpose of exercising the powers conferred upon them by the "The Diseases Prevention Act," and of carrying into effect the Regulations of the Privy Council. At each Meeting, reports have been received relating to the Sanitary condition of the Parish, and to the progress made in execution of preventive measures. The following is a summary of the proceedings of the Committee:— Medical Visitors. In accordance with the fourth Section of the Regulations, the Parish was at the first Meeting of the 4 Committee, divided into districts, for the purposes of medical relief and inspection; and in each District or Sub-division a medical Practitioner was put in charge for these duties. As however it was clearly unnecessary that the systematic visitation should extend to the whole Parish, it was agreed that each medical Visitor should confine his attention for this purpose to those streets within his district in which it appeared to the Medical Officer of Health most probable that alvine disorders would prevail. In all such streets, the medical Visitors were instructed, according to the Regulations, to visit each house daily for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of diarrhoea or cholera, and of giving all necessary medical assistance to the sick. Each medical Visitor was further required, in accordance with the fifth Regulation, to make daily Reports to the Medical Officer of Health, of the new cases of cholera or diarrhoea treated by him during the previous twentyfour hours, and of any nuisance found existing in any premises visited by him. The results of the medical visitation of the Parish during the six weeks terminating September the 15th, are comprised in the following Tables, one of which shews the number of cases of disease treated by each medical Visitor in each week, with the number of deaths and recoveries; while the other (No. 2) exhibits the number of nuisances and sanitary defects reported by each Visitor in each week, with the number of orders made under the sanction of the Sanitary Committee in consequence.

The Committee, at their first Meeting, having received a communication from the Secretary of St. Mary's Hospital, to the effect that the Governors of that Institution were prepared to receive a limited number of patients suffering from cholera, did not think it necessary to take immediate steps for providing Hospital accommodation, in accordance with the tenth Regulation. In case, however, the disease should become prevalent, arrangements were made for the erection of a temporary hospital on ground belonging to the Great Western Railway Company, between Francis Street and South Wharf Road; and in order that there should be no delay in providing against such an emergency, a plan and specifications of a temporary building suitable for the purpose were prepared. Disinfection. For the purpose of disinfecting drains and cleansing foul premises, the Committee judged it expedient to place at the disposal of the Mcdical Officer of Health two labourers, whose services were engaged for a period of five weeks. The following is a list of the houses or other premises so cleansed or disinfected at the public expense:— 10 TABLE V.

The following is a list of places so cleansed:— TABLE VII.

With reference to the fourteenth Regulation, a Report was presented by the Medical Officer of Health on the Spring-Wells accessible to the Public in the Parish; from which it appeared that not more than seven such wells could be discovered. In all cases in which the water of these wells was found to be contaminated, measures were taken, either by arrangement with the owners, or otherwise, to prevent their being used. Returns. On each Monday a Return has been furnished by the Medical Officer of Health of the number of new cases of cholera or diarrhœa reported during the week ending the previous Saturday. Each such Return has been transmitted by the Vestry Clerk to the Medical Department of the Privy Council, in accordance with the 19th Regulation. In fulfilment of Regulation 20, large posting bills were issued on the 2nd of August, in which the owners and occupiers of property were admonished at once to carry out such improvement as might be necessary to insure the wholesome condition of their houses and the prevention of nuisances, and were warned that in all cases of neglect of the orders of the Vestry, proceedings would be promptly taken for the enforcement of penalties. 14 In addition to these placards, a hand-bill was distributed to every family residing in the streets principally inhabited by the poor, to the number of 6,000; containing full information as to the arrangements made by the Committee for the administration of medical relief; the names and addresses of the medical Visitors; and the places appointed as Dispensaries; along with advice as to domestic cleanliness, ventilation and diet; and warnings against intemperance. To each hand-bill was appended a summary of information as to disinfectants, and the most effectual modes of using them. In relation to the mention made in the above Report with regard to the proposed temporary Hospital, the Committee think it right to make a more particular statement. When the need of such a Hospital, should the cholera increase, became manifest, the Committee appointed a deputation, consisting of the Rev. A. Boyd, together with the Chairman of the Committee, and Mr. Gutch, to wait upon the Directors of the Great Western Railway Company in relation to the piece of ground in their possession, between Francis Street and South Wharf Road. At the interview which took place, the Directors, with the utmost kindness and liberality, placed the land at the disposal of the Committee until December next, without any rent or charge whatever; for which 15 the Committee immediately tendered their very grateful acknowledgement. The Committee beg finally to state that cholera, though diminished, has by no means disappeared, more especially in some of the Western and Central Districts; and they therefore recommend that their powers shall still continue, in order that they may be ready to act effectually should occasion arise, though they trust they may not be required to do so. The following is a summary of the expenses incurred by the Committee in the exercise of their powers:— £ s. d. Calvert and Co..
