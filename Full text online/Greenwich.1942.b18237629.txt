GRE 40 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF GREENWICH ABRIDGED REPORT of the ACTING MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1942. CHARLES PORTER M.D., B.Sc., M.R.C.P. (Ed.) Of the Middle Temple, Barrister-at-Law. Health Department. Town Hall, Greenwich, S.E. 10. June 1943. To the Mayor, Aldermen & Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Mr, Mayor, Ladies & Gentlemen, This Report covers the year 1942 and is like several of its predecessors, in accordance with instructions of the Ministry of Health, an abridged one. Since it deals with a period before I began to act and while Dr. Waldron, who entered upon Military Service in January 1943, was still in charge of the Public health Department, the report is perhaps even more abridged than that for 1941. The showing of the Borough for the year 1942 from the Health point of view is eminently satisfactory. The Birth Rate at 18.75 per 1000 is only a little short of the high figure 18.92 attained in the year 1925. The Death Rate, 13.7 per 1000 is lower than that for the previous year by 3 per 1000; while the Infantile Mortality and Maternal Mortality Rates of 32 and 0.86 respectively are again low and very much below the rates for England and Wales. For the third successive year notifications of Infectious Disease were well below the mean. The slight increase in the case of Diphtheria was to some extent countered by an increase in the number of children immunized against the Disease. Scabies gave rise to some anxiety. Owing to increase of Scabies generally throughout the country, in which the Borough shared,, additional powers have been given to Local Authorities in the Scabies Order 1941 to combat the disease. Apart from other steps taken locally, provision for treatment additional to that at Tunnel Avenue was made by utilising the Gas Cleansing Station attached to the Seamen's Hospital. Here all adult male persons are examined and treated. A trained nurse has also been engaged to assist at the Centre and follow up cases. The fact that a great deal of work was done in connection with the provision of War -Time Nurseries calls for mention and it may be noted that in May as a temporary expedient, arrangements were made at four of the Council's First Aid Posts to receive a limited number of children until the proper facilities were available. By the end of the year W ar-Time Nurseries were fully functioning near the Deptford boundary, at East Greenwich and at Blackheath. I feel sure that it would he the wish of Dr. Waldron that reference should be made to the valuable services rendered by the staff of the Department and tribute paid to them on account of the work they did and the loyalty they displayed. He would also I know, like to express gratitude to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health, Maternity and Child Welfare Committee and to Colleagues in other Departments of the Council's service. It gives me great pleasure to do this and to add words of thanks on my own behalf. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies & Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, Charles Porter. STATISTICS, Year 1942.

Representations were received from the Ministry of Labour and National Service and the Ministry of Health stating it was desirable to set up Day Nursery facilities in order to assist women who were desirous of undertaking war work but were prevented from doing so owing to family ties. As a temporary arrangement four of the First Aid Posts functioning under the Civil Defence Scheme were utilised for this purpose, a dozen children being accommodated at each Post. A fee of l/- is charged for each child per day. After protracted negotiation as to suitable sites and many difficulties encountered in obtaining necessary staff the following permanent Day Nurseries were established:- 1. Rachael McMillan Nursery School, Deptford Church Street, S.E. 8. Opened 20th July 1942. Accommodation for 40 children under 2 years and 65 between the ages of 2 and 5 years. 2. Conley Street, East Greenwich, S.E. 10. Opened 30th September, 1942, accommodation for 10 under 2 years and 30 between the ages of 2 and 5 years. 3. 154 Shooters Hill Road, S.E. 3. (late Blackheath and Charlton Cottage Hospital) opened 21st December 1942 accommodation for 48 children from 2 to 5 years of age. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. From springtime onwards many complaints were received regarding nuisances caused by mosquitoes breeding in static water tanks. In all cases where it was found necessary the tanks were emptied, thoroughly scoured out and treated with special oils and insecticides. In addition to the many duties arising out of war time conditions disinfestation is undertaken at premises requisitioned by the Council for storage of furniture from bombed houses. Disinfestation has also been carried out at the various Public Air Raid Shelters and Warden Posts in the Borough.
