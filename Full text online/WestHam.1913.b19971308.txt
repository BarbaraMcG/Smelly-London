LONDON: The Avenue Press, Ltd., Stratford, E., and 6 and 8, Bouverie Street, E.C. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Borough of West Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under the Public Health Act is required by order of the Local Government Board to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence. The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district, and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in those circumstances." In accordance with the above requirement, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1913, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which, therefore, are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. 4 Physical Features and General Character of the District.—West Ham is situate in latitude 51° 30' to 51° 33' N., and the longitude 0° to 1' W., to 0° 3' E., on the extreme west of the County of Essex, and on the eastern side of the administrative County of London, from which it is separated by the windings of the River Lee and Bow Creek for 3½ miles. In shape it is an irregular rhomboid, some 2 miles from west to east and 4 miles from north to south, comprising within its boundaries 4,706 acres. The northern and eastern sides of the Borough are contiguous to the populated districts of Leyton and East Ham. The southern boundary is formed by the River Thames for 21/8 miles. In elevation it is almost flat, varying from less than 5ft. to 45ft. above ordnance datum, about half of the area being not more than 10ft. above that level. Chalk may be reached at depths varying from 100ft. to 150ft., overlaid by green Thanet sands and Woolwich beds, on which rests 5ft. to 50ft. of London clay. In the north-eastern half of the Borough 16ft. to 20ft. of river drift gravel overlays the London clay, sloping down towards the River Lee and River Thames into marshy clay and alluvium, a large part of the immediate surface being made ground. 5 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,335.8 hours, being 251 hours less than in 1912. The hottest day was 17th June, when the temperature reached 871 degrees, and the coldest day was 23rd February, when it sank to 242 degrees. The number of rainy days was 174, the total rainfall of the year being 22.51 inches. The greatest daily fall occurred on 26th October, when 0 78 inch fell. Meteorology during 1913.

Milk Supply.—Under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, 330 premises were on the Register for the sale of Milk at the commencement of the year, the majority of these being small general shops retailing very small quantities of milk, the storage of which is frequently of a doubtful character. On inspection, 40 were found to require cleansing or to exhibit defects remediable under the Public Health Acts. 22 milkshops were struck off the Register and 27 placed thereon during the year. In addition to the above, the Register contained the names of 20 persons registered as cowkeepers. 101 visits were paid to the cowsheds of these persons, and in several cases notices to cleanse or remedy structural defects were served upon the cowkeepers. Most of the cowsheds were kept in a fairly cleanly state, but there is still much room for improvement in some, both in the character of the buildings and in the care exercised in the collection and distribution of the milk. With a view to the detection of Tuberculosis of the Udder, prior to the year 1908, an annual inspection of all cows in the Borough was made by the Council's Veterinary Surgeon, but in that year the Council, on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, decided that a quarterly inspection should be made. 8 The following is a list of the Cowsheds in the Borough:- Situation of Cowshed. Cows Inspected Blanche Street 19 Balaam Street 10 Howards Road 9 Maryland Street 2 Queens Road, Tidal Basin 1 Vicarage Lane 78 Church Street North 30 Gift Lane 16 Beale Street 10 Idmiston Road 14 Globe Crescent 7 Neville Road 12 Poplar Street 15 Thomas Street 11 Whitwell Road 14 Edward Street 3 Blind Lane 3 Camel Road 3 Edwin Street 25 Anne Street 16 298 I received the following Reports during the year after the cows had been examined :— (1) All the cows were practically healthy. There were a few cases of temporary inflammation of the udder, but in each instance the cow was a fresh one in and newly calved. (2) The cows were generally healthy and well conditioned. No case was observed in the udders requiring special 9 attention. The inspection had no relation to the new Tuberculosis Order, as many of the visits were made before the Order came into operation. During the latter part of the year, owing to the illness of Mr. Glover, Mr. A. McCunn, M.R.C.V.S., took temporary duty as Veterinary Inspector, and in November he was officially appointed as such in consequence of the death of Mr. Glover, which occurred early in October. Chief Occupations of Inhabitants.—West Ham is a typical industrial Borough. l arge factories abound on the liver frontages west and south; railway works employing thousands of regular hands are located in the north, and large docks—the staple support of casual labour—intersect the south. The rest of the area may be said to form the dormitory of artizans, clerks and others whose daily work is carried on in London, together with the local shops and retail businesses necessary for the welfare of their families There is no particular industry calculated to specially affect the public health. Housing Accommodation.—The dedicated roads of the Borough extend to 127¼ miles, some four-fifths of which are at least 40 ft. wide, and are bordered by houses of two storeys. Originally constructed as self-contained houses, they have, in a large measure, been adapted by alterations and additions for the accommodation of two families, while in recent years the flat system has been generally adopted in developing the newer estates. Very few blocks of dwellings of three or more storeys exist, and the unsatisfactory character of these give rise to the need for constant supervision and action by the Sanitary Staff. The erection of all new buildings are supervised by Building Inspectors of the Borough Engineer's Department. At the census in 1901 there were 41,368 inhabited houses in the Borough. The figures for the 1911 census published by the Registrar 10 General, show them then to be 61,882 families or separate occupiers. The census population figures for the Wards were published in my report for 1911, and those now given in the table on page 39 are the estimated approximate figures to the middle of 1913. A regular house-to-house visitation is paid to these, and during the year the number of dwelling-houses inspected was 14,785, while, in addition, 3,458 were visited on account of infectious disease. The following matters were dealt with either under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, or the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act:— Re Nos. 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35, Martindale Road. Following upon the proceedings taken by the Council last year, the Council made Closing Orders in respect of the above houses. Be Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7, and 8, Vicarage Cottages. The Closing Order in respect of the above premises having been operative for three months, the Committee heard the owners, with the result that a Demoltion Order was made and suspended, plans having been submitted by them for the demolition of six of the cottages and the re-construction of two. Re Nos. 101a, 103a, 105a, 107a, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 123, 125, 127,-129, and 131, Prince Regents Lane. These houses were reported, and the question of Closing Orders being made was considered, but the matter was adjourned for three months, the owners having submitted specifications, which, if carried out, would render the houses habitable. These wholesale repairs were duly undertaken, and there was, therefore, no necessity to proceed further with the question of Closing Orders. Re Nos. 21, 31, and 33, Carlton Street. These houses were also reported with a view of making Closing 11 Orders in respect thereof, but the owners undertaking to render them fit for human habitation, the matter was adjourned for six months. At the end of the year the necessary work was in progress. Re Nos. 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, Bidder Street, and No. 38, Junction Street These houses were reported to the Committee, and on their recommendation Closing Orders were made by the Council. Nothing having been done the Committee contemplated the making of Demolition Orders, but in the meantime the owners proceeded to demolish without the making of such an Order. Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910. The following is the report on the work carried out under the above Regulations during the year 1913, together with tabular statement in accordance with Article 5 of the said Regulations. The Regulations provide for the Inspection for the purposes of Sub-section 1 of Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act of 1909, by the Medical Officer of Health, or by an Officer designated by the Local Authority but coming under his directions and supervision, and require that the inspection of each house shall deal with the following matters :— (1) The arrangements for preventing the contamination of the water supply. (2) Closet accommodation. (3) Drainage. (4) The condition of the dwelling-house in regard to light, free circulation of air, dampness and cleanliness. (5) The paving, drainage and sanitary condition of any yard or outhouses belonging to the dwelling-house. 12 (6) The arrangements for the deposit of refuse and ashes. (7) The existence of any room which contravenes Sub-section 7 of Section 17 of the Act of 1909. (8) Defects in other matters which tend to render the dwelling- house dangerous to the health of an inhabitant. The Regulations also provide for the records being kept in connection with the inspection. For years past, a house-to-house inspection has been carried on in West Ham, and immediately upon the issue of the above Regulations, the Inspectors were instructed to continue their systematic inspection, each of them being supplied with a copy of the Regulations. As a result of such inspection during the year 1913, the following action was taken under the Housing and Town Planning Act:— No. of Houses inspected 14,785 No. discovered unfit for human habitation 23 No. represented by the Medical Officer of Health under Section 17, Sub-section 2 23 No. of Closing Orders made—Section 17, Sub-section 3 12 No. rendered fit without Closing Orders 14 No. rendered fit after Closing Orders — The general character of the defects found to exist included defective drain, soil pipes and w.c. pans, foul and defective surface gullies, sink waste and rain-water pipes, absence of water fittings, dilapidated conditions of roofs, windows, staircases, fireplaces, and walls and ceilings. Five houses, Nos. 89 and 93, Garvary Road, and Nos. 13, 15, and 17, Mona Street, which had been closed by Magistrate's Orders were rendered fit during the year, and Determining Orders were granted under the Public Health Acts. 13 Food Inspection.—Each of the 12 Inspectors is required to inspect the food shops and slaughter-houses in his district. In addition to these, the Food Inspector who devotes the greater part of his time to the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, is charged equally with the other Inspectors with the duty of safeguarding the sale of food in market streets and other premises where dietary articles are exposed for sale. In the appendix to this report will be found a list of unsound food seized as unfit and unwholesome at its time of exposure for sale, or condemned without formal seizure under Section 117 Public Health Act, 1875. Legal procedings were instituted during the year in one case under the above section in which the defendant was charged with exposing Tomatoes for sale unfit for human food, the fine imposed being £1 including costs. The "American Gooseberry Mildew (Fruit) Order, 1912," issued last year by the Board of Agriculture with the object of detecting the disease of sphaerotheca mors-uvœ which particularly affects that fruit, continued to have the attention of the Inspectors. An application was received during the summer from a large firm of importers of South American Tongues for arrangements to be made by the Council to permit the Inspectorial Staff to examine Tongues at the Factory instead of their being examined at the Port of Entry. The Council were unable to make special arrangements for this purpose as they would be practically carrying out the duties of the Port Sanitary Authority at the expense of the official inspection within the Borough. Inspection of Bakehouses and Fishshops.—This is also carried out by the Inspectors, particular attention being directed to the regular removal of offal and trade refuse, which is carried out by private contractors. 14 In connection with nuisances arising from the fishmonger's trade, complaints continued to be received in the summer months of the offensive odours arising from the removal of fish offal, and during the year four persons were prosecuted for conveying offensive matter through the district during prohibited hours. Slaughter-houses.—There are now upon the Register 16 old registered slaughter-houses and one registered knacker's yard, together with 16 annually licensed slaughter-houses and one annually licensed knacker's yard. Owing to the proximity to the London market the amount of slaughtering carried out locally forms a small percentage of the meat sold, but the infrequency of use and scattered location of the private slaughter-house render efficient inspection extremely difficult and unsatisfactory. I dealt with the possibilities in this connection very fully in my report for 1910. During the year Mr. J. Taylor, of No. 9, Otley Terrace, Prince Regents Lane, applied for permission to slaughter pigs in a stable at No. 25, Upper Road, Plaistow, but the application was refused. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—Although each Inspector of Nuisances is required by the terms of his appointment to take samples if necessary under the above Acts, a special Inspector is appointed ad hoc to devote the greater part of his time to carrying out the duties imposed by their provisions on the Council. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and the Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912, 1,266 samples were purchased for analysis, and 120 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated, the number of samples taken being at the rate of 4.2 per 1,000 of the census population. In London the samples taken during the year 1912 were at the rate of 5 6 per 1,000, and in the rest of England at the rate of 2'6 per 1,000. I applied for summonses in 61 cases, at the hearing of which fines and costs amounting to £116 15s. were imposed. The particulars of these will be found in the appendix. 15 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Article. Adulterated. Genuine. Analysed.

They might be described as Milks of very poor quality rather than adulterated Milk, but under the "Sale of Milk Regulations" the Local Government Board state that "it remains the duty of the Analyst to class as adulterated or not up to standard all Milk samples failing to reach the limits fixed by the Regulations."

Other observations (if any) — During the year the Maypole Dairy Co., Ltd., were registered as wholesale Dealers in Margarine on premises at 84, Rathbonc Street, Canning Town. Sewerage and Drainage.—The water carriage system of sewage removal is almost universal throughout the whole area of the district. With few exceptions all houses are provided with properlyHushed modern water-closets, discharging through appropriate pipes B 2 20 into brick sewers, which also convey the surface water and most of the rainfall. The Southern portion of the Borough, being isolated by the Victoria and Albert Dock, is drained into a main sewer running from West to East, through a narrow strip of the Southern portion of the Borough of East Ham, whence it discharges into the London County Council Sewer in North Woolwich. The North-western corner of the Borough—an area of roughly 120 acres containing two terraces of houses and some isolated houses and factories—remains unsewered, the excrement disposal consisting of cesspools, while scattered cesspools are to be found here and there in a few places remote from the general system of sewerage. The sewers draining the main portion of the district (five-sixths of the whole area) converge by means of specially constructed intercepting sewers to the Corporation's Pumping Station, situate near the middle of the Western border of the Borough. Here the sewerage is pumped into the Northern Metropolitan Outfall Sewer which crosses the Borough obliquely, whence it gravitates to the London Outfall at Barking. Collection of House Refuse.—By the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, the Corporation is empowered to require owners of houses to provide movable receptacles for house refuse instead of ashpits, and by special bye-law the occupiers of houses are required to place them outside their houses on such days as the Council fix. Under these provisions the house refuse is collected twice each week by the Council's own vehicles. Thirty-six carts and vans are used, and the staff employed numbers 56 men, besides the Dust Inspector and two foremen. The total amount collected during the 307 working days in the year was 28,408 loads, a decrease of 721 loads on the previous year. 21 The shoots on which the above house refuse was deposited, together with the number of loads in each case, are set out below :— Out of the Borough.

Tenders for erection were obtained, but the recommendation of the Public Health Committee that their consideration be adjourned for 12 months was not accepted by the Council, they referring the question to a Joint Committee of the Public Health and Tramways, and they in their turn referred the matter back to the Public Health Committee. The disposal of the refuse by the erection of a "crusher," and the resultant pulverized matter sold for agricultural purposes was thoroughly considered by the Committee, and a quantity of West Ham refuse was treated and analysed with a view to ascertaining its suitability for this purpose The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to hold over their definite decision, and with that end in view negotiations were sanctioned with Messrs. Cory to extend the existing contract for " barging " for a period not exceeding two years. BYE-LAWS RELATING TO OFFENSIVE TRADES, COMMON LODGING HOUSES, &c. Offensive Trades.—Upwards of 30 premises where statutory offensive businesses are carried on are located in the Borough, and include soap manufacturers, 9; fat melters and bone boilers, 16 ; gut scrapers, 2; fish and offal contractors, 2; organic manure manufacturers, 2 ; other trades, 5. These are subject to constant inspection and may be said to be carried on with comparatively little nuisance to the general public. The following fresh applications were dealt with during the year under review:— An application was made by the Amalgamated Chemical Works, of No. 36, King Street, E.C., to steam bones on the premises in the 24 occupation of Messrs. Odams, Victoria Docks. The Committee after visiting the premises decided not to grant the application. An application for degreasing bones and glue making by Messrs. Duché & Knight, Ltd., on an extension of the premises of Messrs. John Knight, Ltd , Silvertown, was sanctioned. An application by Mr. M. P. Hunt, of No. 4, Rosemary Avenue, Church End, Finchley, to manufacture toilet, bar, and soft soaps, on premises lately occupied by the Hart Accumulator Company, in Marshgate Lane, was granted provided that no fat melting or bone boiling be carried on. Common Lodging Houses.—There are 14 Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, seven in the Stratford district and seven in the Tidal Basin district, all of which, with one exception, were originally constructed and used for other purposes such as private dwellings or warehouses, and have been adapted more or less successfully to meet the requirements of the Common Lodging House Bye-laws. The accommodation in these amount to 964 beds. During the year, Mr. Choy Sing, of No. 37, West India Dock Road, applied for permission to use No. 29, Tidal Basin Road, as a Chinese Seamens' Boarding House, and the application was granted. The application of Mr. Thomas A Felton to use No. 130, Barking Road, as a Common Lodging House was refused. Schools.—The Public Elementary Schools consist of 49 Council Schools and 14 Non-Provided Schools, together with four Council Special Schools, and two Higher Elementary Schools, affording in the aggregate accommodation for 69,548 scholars. 25 The Schools are for the most part modern, substantially built buildings, adequately supplied with water and provided with sufficient surrounding air space, while their general cleanliness appears to be well looked after. With a view to checking the spread of epidemic disease it has been the practice for many years past for the Medical Officer of Health on receiving information of the occurrence of infectious disease in the family of a scholar to send a red-coloured notice to the Head Teacher of the School (Day School and Sunday School) recommending the exclusion of children coming from the infected home, subsequently followed by a white notice freeing the family from quarantine on the completion of the necessary isolation and the official disinfection of the premises. Each School is provided with a supply of disinfectants for general or special use. The particular action taken with regard to Schools during the year will be found under the heading "Chief Zymotic Diseases." Methods of Dealing with Infectious Disease.—Prior to the Infectious Disease Notification Act, 1899, the notification of these diseases in West Ham had been compulsory for 11 years, under special powers obtained by the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, which provided for the notification of all the diseases specified in the general Act, with the exception of Erysipelas and Membranous Croup. The Hospital accommodation of the Borough for the isolation of infectious disease consists of— (1) The Plaistow Fever Hospital (opened as to two wards in 1896 and as to the completed Hospital in 1901) now contains 210 beds, allocated to the following purposes: 26 110 beds for Scarlet Fever, 63 for Diphtheria, 22 for Enteric Fever, and 15 isolation beds for Mixed or Staff cases. (2) Dagenham Small-pox Hospital, situate about 9 miles from the Borough, occupying a site of 6i acres, enclosed within a farm of 119 acres, owned and cultivated by the Council, was opened in 1899. It consists of permanent buildings capable of accommodating 50 patients with the administrative staff required for their care, together with temporary iron buildings sufficient to treat 300 cases. Under agreement, eight other Sanitary Authorities contribute to the establishment and maintenance of this Hospital, in consideration of West Ham undertaking to receive and treat all the Small-pox cases sent to the Hospital by those Authorities. This Hospital is now being used as a temporary Sanatorium. (3) The Grange Convalescent Home is situate about 9½ miles from the Borough at Harold Wood, Essex, in which the accommodation is ample for 40 children. This Home consists of a residential mansion with outbuildings and 7 acres of ground, together with 61½ acres of pasture land, and has required considerable alterations and additions to render it fit for its present use. The Home was opened for the reception of patients on 22nd February, 1909. In connection with the Dagenham Hospital is a building containing an Equifex steam disinfector for Hospital use, while attached to the Plaistow Fever Hospital is a large Washington-Lyons disinfector, so arranged as to serve the purposes of a public disinfecting station for the treatment of bedding, &c., of infectious cases occurring in the Borough on removal to hospital or on recovery at home. 27 Methods of Control of Tuberculosis.—Down to the end of 1908 no system, voluntary or compulsory, of notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis pertained in West Ham, and consequently very few cases of living consumptives were brought to the knowledge of the Public Health Department. Since 1st January, 1909, the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, issued by the Local Government Board, have been in operation, by which the notification of Phthisis occurring in Poor Law Institutions or under the care of District Medical Officers became compulsory. On the 22nd March, 1911, the Local Government Board issued further regulations making Pulmonary Tuberculosis compulsorily notifiable by the Medical Officer of any hospital in any out- or in-patient. This came into operation on the 1st May, 1911. At the end of that year the Local Government Board issued a further Order making Pulmonary Tuberculosis notifiable as and from January 1st, 1912, by Medical Practitioners in their private practice and also School Medical Inspectors, so from this date all cases of Phthisis with a few exceptions became notifiable to the Local Authority. In December, 1912, the Local Government Board issued further Rogulations revoking all the above-mentioned Orders, and making all forms of Tuberculosis notifiable as and from February 1st, 1913. The number of cases notified both pulmonary and other forms, will be found in the Appendix, page 87. In all cases notified a member of the Sanitary Staff visits the home, with a view to the remedying of any existing defects in the structural surroundings of the patient, of advising him as to the necessity of properly using the means at his disposal, of aiding him by verbal converse and printed literature to appreciate the value to himself and his family of the proper treatment and disposal of his expectoration, and of teaching him the right use of disinfectants. In every case of a recorded death from Phthisis a similar visit is paid, disinfection of the premises advised and, in most cases, carried out. 28 With regard to the treatment of Tuberculosis, the National Insurance Act came into operation on July 15th, 1912, and in my report for last year I set out in full the whole aspect of the position, and obligations of the Council under the Act. The utilization of the Council's Small Pox Hospital at Dagenham, continued to receive the sanction of the Local Government Board as a temporary Sanatorium, and during the year 134 cases of both sexes were admitted thereto, all of whom were insured persons. The development of the scheme for the erection of the permanent Sanatorium continued to have the serious attention of the Council and Public Health Committee. Various sites were visited at different periods, with the result that the Council adopted the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, that the Council purchase Wootton's Farm, Langdon Hills, Essex, and that an application be made to the Local Government Board for their sanction thereto. With regard to Dispensary treatment, it was resolved to erect a temporary building upon land adjoining the Public Baths, Balaam Street, already in possession of the Public Health Committee. Plans for the building, consisting of large waiting room, two dressing rooms, medical consulting room, laboratory, nurses' room and offices, were approved by the Local Government Board, and at the end of the year considerable progress had been made towards the building being utilized for its intended purpose. Dr. W. L. Burgess was appointed Tuberculosis Officer on 17th February, but he subsequently resigned, and was succeeded on 24th June by Dr. F. G. Collins, who had been acting as a School Medical Inspector under the Education Committee. The question of the formation of a Consultative Committee in accordance with the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis, to consider the whole treatment of the disease in the Borough, was one which has been before the Council for the first part of the year, and it was eventually agreed that its constitution consist of the Chairman and six other members of the Public Health 29 mittee, and five members of the Sanatorium Committee of the Insurance Committee, with no executive authority. Suggestions were laid before the Consultative Committee by the members of the Insurance Committee thereon, for a permanent AntiTuberculosis scheme, and I reprint hereunder a Memorandum which I submitted to the Consultative Committee upon the suggestions put forward, with the result that the Council adopted the following resolution on October 14th, 1913:— Public Health Committee, 8th October, 1913. Clause 14— That, . . . they have carefully considered the suggestions of the Representatives of the Insurance Committee and the Memorandum of the Medical Officer of Health brought up therewith . . . and recommeud that the principle of absolute control by the Council suggested by the Medical Officer of Health in his Memorandum be adopted, and that it be referred back to your Committee to consider and report in what way representation can best be given to the Insurance Committee. The Council also adopted the principle of the treatment of all persons suffering from Consumption, whether insured persons, dependents of insured persons, or non-insured persons, and also decided to apply to the Local Government Board for sanction to utilise another section of Dagenham Temporary Sanatorium for the treatment of such cases. The following is the Memorandum referred to:— MEMORANDUM BY MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Consultative Committee. Prior to the passingof the National Insurance Act, 1911, the operations of Sanitary Authorities throughout the country were 30 In the main devoted to the taking of measures for the prevention of Pulmonary Consumption as distinct from measures for the treatment of individual sufferers. Only in a few of the largest and wealthiest towns were concerted means for treatment forthcoming, and in these the Municipal Authorities were often aided by local voluntary organizations. In the vast majority of the districts the actual treatment of consumption may be said to have been restricted to the large Voluntary Hospitals and to the Poor Law Infirmaries. Nevertheless, the death-rate from consumption had steadily and continuously fallen, a fact attributed by many sanitarians to the increasing use made of the Poor Law Infirmaries, whereby the segregation of persons in an advanced and generally infectious stage of the disease tended to limit the amount of infectious material both in public places and in the homes of the people, and this fact must be steadily borne in mind when considering the proposals for a complete scheme of treatment. The Councils of Sanitary Authorities, under the provisions of the Public Health Acts and the Tuberculosis Regulations, have had the power of treating cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis both in their homes and in institutions such as dispensaries, sanatoria, and hospitals, but have not to any great extent utilized those powers, probably by reason of the expense involved. The combined effect of the Finance Act, 1911, and the National Insurance Act, 1911, is the provisions of such sums of money from the Treasury and the Insurance Committee as shall offer a sufficient inducement to the Sanitary Authority to enter themselves upon a large expenditure with a view to dealing with Tuberculosis in a comprehensive manner, and the chief difficulty which fronts the Council is the inability to form even an approximate estimate of what that expenditure may be. Some idea, however, in this direction may be gathered from 31 the following extracts from the circular issued by the Local Government Board on the 14th May, 1912:— "The Board agree generally with the findings of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis in their Interim Report and commend the report to the serious consideration of Local Authorities." "The Committee suggest one dispensary for every 200,000 of the population." "As regards Sanatoria one bed per 5,000 of the population should be provided.'' "As regards Hospital Beds the Committee make the rough estimate that, in addition to Poor Law Beds, the same proportion would seem to be required, that is to say, one bed per 5,000 of the population." "The Board propose to adopt the financial recommendations made by the Committee in regard to the distribution of the Capital Grant." CAPITAL OUTLAY. It would appear that in order to satisfy the above requirements West Ham must provide at least one dispensary and 120 beds (Sanatorium and Hospital). The cost of the Council's Dispensary, now nearly completed, may be set down as £450. The cost of 120 beds can only approximately be estimated. The Departmental Committee suggested that the cost of a Sanatorium should not exceed £150 per bed, a suggestion which is not likely to be fulfilled where hospital beds are added, and the Medical Officer of Health submits that the very lowest all-round figure should be £200 per bed (inclusive of land). The maximum parliamentary grant possible in accordance with the financial recommendations of the Departmental 32 mittee adopted by the Board would be at £1 per 750 of the population in respect of the Dispensary £392, and at £90 per bed in respect of the Sanatorium £10,800, or a total of £11,192, but when the deputation from the Public Health Committee attended at Whitehall they were informed that the sum available for capital grant in West Ham would scarcely exceed £9,000. If the above assumptions are correct the initial capital outlay on Institutions would be as under:— £ £ Dispensary 450 120 Hospital and Sanatorium beds, at £200 per bed 24,000 24,450 Less Parliamentary Grant 9,000 £15,450 This sum of £15,450 would be a direct charge upon the Council's funds. COST OF MAINTENANCE. It is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of the cost of maintaining all the Institutions of a fully-developed scheme. The heavy cost entailed by the opening of Dagenham as a Sanatorium is an unfair test, and it is proposed, therefore, in this report to assume that the Council may be ultimately able to reduce its maintenance charges to a figure nearly commensurate with that of many similar Institutions. Limiting the present enquiry to Dispensary, Sanatorium, and Hospital charges, it may safely be alleged that if the Dispensary is to fully carry out its functions it must at least be staffed with the Tuberculosis Officer, four Nurses, and a Clerk, whose combined salaries would presently amount to £1,000 per annum. Although at first the majority of patients treated would be insured patients, their number would 33 be rapidly increased by the inclusion of non-insured and contacts, and it would therefore be wise to assume that before very long a thousand patients per annum would pass through the Dispensary, the cost of treating whom it is estimated would amount to at least £1 per head. The cost of patients in Sanatoria has frequently been asserted to amount from 30s. to 35s. per week ; and as it is proposed to place the Sanatorium and Hospital together, it would be unwise to estimate the ultimate cost, when the establishment is full, to anything less than an all-round price of 35s. The annual cost of 120 beds at the above figure would amount to £10,920. In addition to the above a sum of £200 per annum should be allocated to the Public Health Department for home disinfection, clerical work, &c. If these assumed figures are correct—and it is suggested that they form as low an estimate as possible—the cost of maintenance would work out as under :— £ Dispensary—Salaries of Staff, &c. 1,000 Cost of 1,000 patients 1,000 Sanatorium and Hospital—120 beds at 35s. per week 10,920 Public Health Office 200 £13,120 The sum of £13,120 per annum would be a charge allocated in varying proportions between the Insurance Committee, the Council, and the Treasury. c 34 In the financial statement issued by the Insurance Committee's representatives on the Consultative Committee it is suggested that the Insurance Committee should pay over to the Council, in return for all services rendered by the Council, an amount represented by 7½d. per insured person, with a minimum of £3,000. The number of insured persons is given as 92,000, which figure at 7½d. works out at £2,875. In order to bring the minimum of £3,000 up to £3,500 the number of insured persons must be increased by 18,000. It is doubtful if this number will be reached for many years to come, and it is therefore evident that all the financial assistance which the Council can hope to obtain from the Insurance Committee to meet this heavy expenditure is £3,500. Deducting this sum from the maintenance cost mentioned above, viz., £13,120, a balance is left of £9,620 to be divided between the Treasury and the Council, and it must be borne in mind that to secure an even division of this amount the Council will have to keep the whole of the expenditure at a sufficiently low figure to satisfy the Local Gover nment Board. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. It will be clear from the foregoing statement that while the statutory functions laid upon the Insurance Committee include (a) the duty of arranging for the treatment of all insured persons, and (b) the power of arranging for the treatment of dependents of insured persons, the funds at the disposal of the Committee are strictly limited, and, in my opinion, insufficient to adequately cover even the treatment of the insured. It is further clear that if the Council enter into an arrangement with the Insurance Committee and agree in consideration 35 of accepting the whole of the Insurance Committee's available funds, to carry out a scheme embracing the treatment of all persons, whether insured, dependents of insured, or non-insured, the responsibilities falling upon the Council will be indefinite in extent, and their financial liabilities practically unlimited for a long series of years. The Council, however, as the Public Health Authority, will not shrink from the burden laid upon it, and will recognise that in the eradication of the scourge of consumption the end will ultimately justify the present onerous means, but in view of all the circumstances it is suggested that the Council should for this purpose retain the absolute unfettered control of all its institutions, organization, and officials, and this can only be affected by the Insurance Committee agreeing, in addition to handing over its available funds, to accept the recommendations of the Council's Medical Officials in their respective capacities, as to the appropriate treatment of all cases submitted to them for examination and treatment, such recommendations being conveyed to the Insurance Committee through the office of the Medical Officer of Health. It is obvious that it would serve no useful purpose to enter into minor details until the broad principle outlined above shall be either accepted or rejected. I am, your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS. 36 Births.—The number of births registered in the Borough during the year was 9,194 (4,733 males and 4,461 females), which will be found distributed in the following table. From this number, however, 69 (41 males and 28 females) have to be deducted in accordance with the return supplied by the Registrar-General as belonging elsewhere, bringing the total net births to 9,125. This is an increase over last year's net births of 483, and 350 above the average number during the preceding five years. The birth-rate for the year was 30.51 per 1,000, while the average birth-rate during the five years 1908-1912 was 30.50 per 1,000. The distributed births in the various wards of the Borough were as follows:— Ward. Males. Females. Total births. New Town 236 244 480 Forest Gate 270 227 497 High Street 366 330 696 Broadway 205 207 412 Park 164 174 338 Upton 183 178 361 West Ham 520 491 1,011 Plaistow 584 537 1,121 Hudsons 509 468 977 Canning Town 556 521 1,077 Tidal Basin 627 576 1,203 Custom House 513 508 1,021 37 Illegitimate Births.—203, or 2.2 per cent. of the total births were illegitimate. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in the Borough during the year was 3,471, including the following deaths in public institutions within the district:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Plaistow Hospital 6 34 West Ham Hospital 26 127 St. Mary's Hospital 16 40 Seamen's Branch Hospital — 41 Plaistow Maternity Home 2 8 Medical Mission Hospital 3 18 Forest Lane Branch Workhouse 7 270 Other Places 1 30 Non-residents registered in the district 12 242 The 3,471 deaths do not include the undermentioned deaths in public institutions and elsewhere outside the district:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Workhouse and Infirmary 35 557 Borough Asylum — 111 Dagenham Sanatorium — 9 Residents dying in London Institutions and elsewhere 72 311 38 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the net deaths of the Borough numbered 4,312 (2,309 males and 2,003 females), being 166 more than the previous year and 56 more than the average for the last five years. This makes an annual death-rate for the year of 14.42 per 1,000, or 0.28 less than the average death-rate during the five years 1908-1912, which was 14.70 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution, the annual death-rate becomes 15 42 per 1,000, the factor for correction being 1.0693. Both the foregoing birth-rate and death-rate, as well as the subsequent rates, have been calculated from a population estimated at 299,054 for a 53 weeks year. The Registrar General's estimate for the middle of the year being 294, 223. During the year the number of houses completed and passed for habitation by the Borough Engineer's Staff were as follows:— New Town — West Ham 2 Forest Gate — Plaistow 1 High Street — Hudsons 19 Broadway — Canning Town 1 Park / 3 Tidal Basin — Upton — Custom House 8 The Census figures for the Wards were published in the following table in my Report for 1911, and the figures now given of the csti- 39 mated populations are calculated approximately from the various data at my disposal:— Ward. Estimated Population to middle of 1913. Families or Separate Occupiers at Census 1911 Deaths in 1913. Ward Deathrate*. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 births. Under 1 year. 1 year and upwards.

The death rates, as printed, are calculated upon the estimated populations at the middle of the year 1913, and in order to avoid the possibility of error arising from faulty estimates, the Ward death rates were re-calculated upon the Ward Census figures for 1911, with the result that the rates retained the same relative positions and the same actual amounts within a small decimal figure. Without going minutely into detail, it may be said generally that since 1902, when the smallpox epidemic was exceptionally heavy in the southern part of the Borough, the death-rate of Plaistow Ward, with one or two exceptional years, has been steadily declining, while that of High Street Ward has shown no such tendency. The character of the populations does not differ so markedly as to account for the disparity in the vital statistics, and although the High Street Ward contains a relatively larger number of old houses than Plaistow it would be quite unjustifiable to endeavour to explain the disparity by an appeal to the housing conditions. Nor, indeed, do the actual figures warrant an alarmist propaganda. The difference alluded to is probably the result of several influences acting with varying intensity over varing periods of time, many of which are sufficiently obscure to pass unnoticed. There is, however, one characteristic in which these two wards are glaringly dissimilar, namely, in facilities for medical aid. The Plaistow Ward has for many years contained within its borders two general hospitals and our own Fever Hospital, as well as being the centre from which the chief operations of the Plaistow Maternity 41 Charity and District Nurses Home have been carried on. These amenities are lacking in the High Street Ward, which contains only one resident medical practitioner, and no medical institution such as those above mentioned, and there can be little doubt that the facilities for obtaining medical relief in Plaistow, assisted by the home visitation of the nurses from the Maternity Charity, have had a material effect in producing the beneficial results recorded in connection with that ward. There is reason to believe that, given a suitable house in High Street Ward, the authorities of the Maternity Charity would staff it as a branch establishment and carry on similar home visitation to that now organised in the Southern part of the Borough. That there is plenty of scope for such a branch is shown by the figures given above. Alteration of Registration Sub-Districts.—Following upon the death of Mr. W. Cook, the late Registrar of Plaistow Sub-District, with the consent of the Registrar-General a new scheme was formulated whereby the Borough was divided into five districts instead of four, and bringing the various Registration Sub-Districts into conformity with the boundaries of groups of Wards of the Borough. Chief Zymotic Diseases.—The total deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases numbered 560, making an annual Zymotic death-rate of 1.87 per 1,000, the average Zymotic death-rate during 42 the previous five years being 2.30 per 1,000. In the following tables I append particulars as far as possible relating to each disease separately—both notifiable and non-notifiable epidemic diseases. In the case of the latter, however, the reported cases are necessarily inexact, as the numbers are chiefly obtained from the School Attendance Officers, who are in many cases unable to verify by medical certificate the nature of the illness alleged to be the cause of absence from School.

Consequently, it did not become necessary for the Council to avail themselves of the contingent accommodation provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The Leyton Authorities during the year applied to re-enter the Agreement with the other Authorities, but the West Ham Council deciding that they would have to pay off arrears according to the scale of the Agreement, they (the Leyton Authorities) decided to proceed no further in the matter. Acute Polio-myelitis and Cerebro-Spinal Fever. The Order making these diseases notifiable only came into operation on April 3rd, 1912. During the year 1913 eleven cases 44 of the former disease and two of the latter disease were notified, the deaths being three and two respectively. In accordance with the instructions of the Local Government Board the following is a resume of the investigations into ten of the cases in which reliable information was obtainable:— Case 1.—T. M., aged years, of Sarah Villas, Tunmarsh Lane, was notified on 1st August, but immediately afterwards the family removed to Barking. On obtaining this information and learning the address the particulars were forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of Barking, on 6th August, and the vacated house in Tunmarsh Lane disinfected. No further particulars were obtainable. Case 2.—G. M., aged 2 years 8 months, of Godfrey Street, Stratford. On August 2nd, was shopping with his parents when his father noticed he walked lame. On Sunday, 3rd, he appeared more lame, while on Monday and Tuesday he could do little more than crawl. On Wednesday, August 6th he was taken to the London Hospital as an out-patient, and under the treatment received there has been improvement ever since. He still walks lamely with the right leg, which is colder than the left, but does not appear wasted or thinner. Patient is the third of four children. The mother had two miscarriages before the birth of her first child. No case of paralysis on either side of the family has been known. The disease was notified to the Medical Officer of Health by the Hospital Staff on 22nd August. Case 3.—T. M., aged 1 year, of Gray Street, Silvertown. On or about Friday, 1st August, the child had a fall from 45 its perambulator, striking the left side of the forehead, causing a lump, but "he soon seemed all right." About three weeks later the mother noticed that when he cried his left eye remained open. On sleeping the eye-lid closed, but gradually opened a little. He did not seem at all ill. On August 21st he was taken to the London Hospital, and for a short time attended twice a week. The case was notified by the Hospital on August 23rd, and by the middle of September had so improved that only on crying could anything unusual be noticed. The patient was breast-fed till nearly a year old, and is the youngest of six children, all of whom are well. There is good family history. With regard to the steps taken to prevent the spread of the disease the usual precautions relating to infectious disease generally were given, but it was not considered advisable to keep the other children away from school in view of the improvement that had taken place in each case prior to investigation. With regard to the steps taken to verify the diagnosis the Council has made arrangements for the bacteriological examination of material from patients attacked should the same be desired, but such examination was impossible in the first case which removed to Barking, and in the two cases treated at the London Hospital it was not considered necessary to make the offer. Case 4.—W. H., aged 6 years, of Tinto Road. Family history: Father, mother, and three much older children alive and well; paternal grandmother died of cerebral haemorrhage, maternal grandfather died of "creeping paralysis." Past history: The child had apparently not been very strong since an attack of measles at 46 2 years of age; first went to school at the age of 4; mother noticed he had occasionally difficulty in articulating his words; for several days, perhaps a week, he would have this difficulty, sometimes only once a day, then for months he would be free, but soon after onset of his last illness the difficulty of speech returned worse than ever. Present attack: On Sunday 10th August, 1913, the child said he was tired and cold; his hands were cold, and he cried with pains in the head; the next day he got up, but kept lying down again; the two following days he appeared quite well in the day time, but restless and feverish at night— "jumping in his sleep"; Thursday 14th, he did not want to get up, had a headache, but not so bad as on Sunday, the right cheek appeared a little swollen and the mouth drawn, so that he looked strange, but seemed all right when his mother spoke to him; on Friday 15th, he said his legs felt strange, a medical man saw him on that day and the following day, when marked abdominal breathing appeared to have been noticed; on Sunday 17th, a second medical man was called in, who advised removal to Hospital, and he was taken to the Poplar Hospital, .where he died at 11.30 p.m. on Monday 18th. About a week before he complained of feeling ill he fell over the handle of a hand cart, hurting his left side and back. Although he cried at the time he soon recovered, and did not tell his mother of the accident till some time afterwards. The mother states that a post mortem was made, but no report of the result was obtained. The case was not notified, but the copy of the Registration of the death was received by the Medical Officer of Health some weeks later, whereupon the above particulars were obtained. 47 Case 5.—L. W., aged 2 years 9 months, of Bushey Road. Family history: Maternal grandfather died of paralysis, maternal grandmother, and an uncle and aunt, suffered from chorea, one paternal uncle was an imbecile; father, mother, and two other children (3 years and 1 year) alive and well. Past history: Has always been a bilious child, but never constipated till present illness; had pneumonia at the age of 1 and occasional headaches. There is a history of a fall downstairs some three or four weeks before the illness. Present illness: Tuesday, 23rd September, the child vomited "yellow bile," but was apparently well afterwards; next day wanted to lie down, and seemed unable to walk about; complained of abdominal pain; vomited again in the evening, and was taken to a doctor's surgery, but owing to the numbers waiting the mother obtained a cooling powder at the chemist's; Sunday 28th, as no improvement had occurred a medical man was consulted, who thought the child suffered from Influenza; retching and vomiting continued with constant complaint of feeling tired, and the patient become feverish and "lightheaded" at night, but not feverish in daytime; no rash appeared, but the child became unconscious on Tuesday, 30th. A second medical man was called in and the case notified as acute Polio-myelitis on October 4th. The child died on October 11th, and the premises subsequently disinfected. No school was attended by any children of the family. Case 6.—E. D., aged 1 year 10 months, of Redriff Road. Family history: Father, mother, and one other child (6 months old) alive and well. Past history: Ethel is a fat, healthy-looking child, and has had no previous 48 illness; was weaned at 7 months, and previously was only partly breast-fed; three days before present illness she fell off a chair, without any obvious bruise or after effect, and appeared quite well till the morning of Monday, 15th September, when she had persistent screaming attacks; on the 16th she slept all day and all night, and was "jumpy" in her sleep; took very little nourishment; she had previously been walking for 6 months, and was quite strong on her legs, but on 17th September she dragged her right leg, and when she fell could not get up by herself. On 24th September she was taken to St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow, and remained in much the same condition till the 28th, since when she has steadily improved, and on October 5th was able to walk alone, but has difficulty in rising from the ground. She suffered no pain in the leg except when it was rubbed, and at the time of visit on the day the notification certificate was received (October 10th), apart from the fact that the right leg appeared colder to the touch than the left, there was no obvious difference between the two legs, except that a slight dragging of the right leg was occasionally observable. The child suffered from cough for some days after September 22nd, requiring treatment, but no nasal discharge occurred. She has not lately been away from home or attended any crowded place. Disinfection was offered, but refused. No children attended school. Case 7.—C. G., aged 2 years, of Redriff Road. Family history good, father, mother, and two other children (5 and 4 months respectively) alive and well. Past history: No illness prior to this attack; was breastfed to 10 months, and enjoyed good health till about September 4th, 1913, when he had a slight attack of 49 diarrhoea, and complained when he was lifted up that his left leg hurt him. The mother rubbed the leg with oils, and states that for four days the child was unable to stand, but does not appear to have consulted a medical man till September 11th. The doctor only saw the child once, and apart from the rubbing no further treatment appears to have been adopted till October 15th, when the child was taken to St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow, where he was treated as an out-patient. The case was notified by the Hospital Authorities on October 16th, and on subsequent visitation it was found that no history could be obtained of clinical symptoms such as vomiting, screaming, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, but there was obvious wasting of the muscles of the calf of the left leg, and the child dragged the toes of the left foot along the ground, and frequently fell down. The premises and bedding were disinfected on October 27th at the request of the parent, who stated that the child had recovered, but although much improved there is still marked paresis of the left leg. In view of the fact that the apparent onset of the disease occurred more than six weeks before the notification the other children in the house were not excluded from school. No inter-communication between this family and that of Case No. 6 could be discovered. Case 8.—C. B., aged 5 years, of Station Road. Patient is an only child, whose father died of phthisis. She has always been delicate, but had no illnesses except measles, at the age of 2½ years, and an operation for appendicitis last year. She came from Heath Street, Hampstead, to live at present address on October 3rd, and the present illness began on Friday, October 10th, with a " feverish cold," but she has had no discharge d 50 from eyes or nose, and no cough. First complained of pain in head, then of pains all over, was sick twice on the following day, was slightly delirious at times, and the medical man called in on October 13th, suspected meningitis. Progressive loss of muscular power supervened until she appeared unable to lift either limb. There was no loss of sensation, she could move her fingers and ask to have her limbs moved. She was removed to the West Ham Infirmary, Whipp's Cross, on October 21st, and the disease notified from there on October 24th, since when no further particulars have been obtained. Disinfection was carried out on October 25th. There were no other children in the house. Case 9.—E. R., aged 2½ years, of New City Road. Patient is one of four children (girls) who all appear to be healthy. She has had no previous illness, but there is a fall down five stairs about a month before present attack, which began on August 25th, with indefinite symptoms. On August 27th she refused food, and complained of sore throat, for which she received medical treatment. On August 28th she could not stand, and was very fretful and restless, but did not complain of pain. She had no vomiting, nasal, or other discharge. On August 31st another medical man was consulted, who advised removal to hospital, and she was admitted into St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow, on September 1st, the mother being informed that the child had meningitis. The notification of acute Polio-myelitis was received from the Hospital Authorities on October 25th, and in view of the length of time that had elapsed since the admission of the child to hospital, it was considered impracticable to 51 attempt such preventive measures as disinfection or exclusion of children from school. It is now known what (if any) steps were taken to verify the diagnosis in any of the cases, 4—9. Case 10.—T. T., aged 1 year 11 months, of Malmesburv Terrace. Had a fall downstairs about middle of June. Bled at the mouth, but did not seem much hurt, and soon recovered. On October 29th was seized with convulsions; had eight fits between 3.30 and 11.30 p.m. Right side of mouth drawn, and apparently lost use of right side, but the use gradually returned till at the end of a fortnight he could walk a little, and could use the arm, though it continued weak. On November 20th he entirely lost the use of the arm, accompanied by tenderness and pain. Was taken to Poplar Hospital and there advised to seek treatment at the London Hospital. On November 24th convulsions again recurred, with increased pain on right side and (?) swelling of the forearm. On November 27th he was admitted as an in-patient to the London Hospital, and notified from that Institution as suffering from acute Polio-myelitis on December 2nd. T. T. was a bottle-fed baby, and had twice had attacks of bronchitis. The family history is good: Father and mother well, no history of fits, tuberculosis, or nervous disease in family; the only other child (a girl of 5 months) is a fine child. The family occupy three rooms, the father being a casual labourer. When last visited partial paralysis of right side still remained. D 2 52 Scarlet Fever.—The number of cases notified from this disease was 1,192, being 457 more than in 1912, equivalent to an attack-rate of 3'98 per 1,000, the average attack rate for the preceding five years 1908-1912 being 8.22 per 1,000. Sixteen deaths occurred, making an annual death-rate of 0.05 per 1,000, the average deathrate for the preceding five years being 0.11 per 1,000. The fatality rate was T4 per cent. Of the notified cases, 798, or 66 per cent., were removed to Hospital, a decrease of 7 per cent. on the previous year. The number of cases transferred from Plaistow Hospital to the Convalescent Home, Harold Wood, during the year was 375, where the average duration of stay amounted to 41 days. Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup).—The number of cases notified during 1913 was 427, being78 more than in 1912. The attack-rate was 1.42 per 1,000, the average attack-rate during the past five years being 1.45 per 1,000. Twenty-eight deaths occurred from the disease, equal to an annual death-rate of 0.09 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the past five years being 0.17 per 1,000. The fatality or ratio of deaths to attacks was 6.5 percent. Of the 427 cases notified, 342, or 80"0 per cent., were removed to Hospital. Enteric Fever.—Only 75 cases of this disease were notified during 1913 compared with 90 during the preceding year, and 139 during 1911. This number is equivalent to an annual attack-rate of 0.25 per 1,000, the average attack-rate during the previous five years being 0.38 per 1,000. Nine deaths occurred, making an annual death-rate of 0 03 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the years 1908-1912 being 0.06 per 1,000. The fatality rate was 12.0 per cent. Sixty-six cases out of the 75 were removed to Hospital, equivalent to 88.0 per cent. Besides the admission into Plaistow Hospital of cases of the 53 three preceding diseases, the mixed and other cases received during the year were as follows:— Re-admitted cases 2 Diphtheria and Measles 1 „ „ Scarlet Fever 4 Scarlet Fever and Whooping Cough 2 Chicken Pox 1 Cerebro Spinal Meningitis 2 Measles 2 Whooping Cough 1 Making a total of 15 Measles.—The number of cases reported by the School Attendance Officers was 472, as against 3,026 during the previous year. The deaths numbered 73, making an annual death-rate of 0.24 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the previous five years being 0 69 per 1,000. Whooping Cough.—This disease frequently becomes epidemic when Measles is prevalent, and also occurs as a sequelae of that affection. The number of cases brought to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health was 265, and the number of deaths recorded was 51, equivalent to an annual death-rate of 0.17 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the preceding five years being 0.36 per 1,000. Diarrhoea.—Epidemic Diarrhoea, as a rule, is always responsible for the greater part of the zymotic death-rate, and generally accounts for a considerable share in the death-roll of young children, in that the number of deaths from this disease were 383, as against only 111 for the preceding year. This is equivalent to a death-rate of 1.28 54 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the preceding five years 19081912 being 0.90 per 1,000. Bronchitis (acute and chronic) caused 427 deaths, or a deathrate of 1.42 per 1,000, the average rate for the past five years being 1.37 per 1,000, while the deaths from Pneumonia numbered 379, equal to a death-rate of 126 per 1,000 as compared with an average rate of 1.33 for the preceding five years. Heart Diseases were responsible for 342 deaths, giving a death-rate of 1.14 per 1,000, the five years' average rate being 0.96 per 1,000. Cancer, in which term is included all forms of malignant growth, showed a decrease of 12 below the number of deaths recorded during 1912, the number for 1913 being 247. The death-rate is equal to 0.82 per 1,000 as compared with a five years' average rate of 0.81 per 1,000. Tubercular Diseases.—During the year 1913 827 cases of Phthisis were notified, equivalent to a rate of 2.76 per 1,000 of the population. The total number of deaths of West Ham residents from the same cause was 332, equal to a death-rate of 1.11 per 1,000, while the deaths from other tubercular diseases numbered 128, equal to a death-rate of 0 42 per 1,000. During the previous five years the average death-rate from Phthisis was 1.17 per 1,000, and that of other tubercular diseases was 0.43 per 1,000. Puerperal Fever.—Twelve cases of this disease were notified during the year, and five proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 416 per cent. The attack rate (0.04 per 1,000) was the same as the average rate for the previous five years (0.04 per 1,000), 55 while the death-rate (0.0l per 1,000) was the same as the average for five years (0 01 per 1,000). Midwives Act, 1902.—The Midwives' Roll for 1913 contained the names of 358 Certified Midwives residing in West Ham, being a decrease of 1 on the names on the Roll for the previous year, which numbered 359. Onty 62 midwives sent in notice of their intention to practise during the year in accordance with Section 10 of the Act. 285 records of sending for medical aid were received from 45 midwives, and the causes which induced them to require assistance are detailed as under:— Premature birth 10 Transverse presentation 5 Foot ,, 1 Funis „ 3 Mai „ 5 Face 3 Breech „ 2 Hand and arm ,, 4 Ante-partum haemorrhage 17 Post-partum ,, 13 Ruptured perinaeum 39 Feeble condition of infant 19 ,, ., mother 25 Prolonged first stage 27 ,, second stage 22 Precipitated labour 1 Instrumental delivery 15 Placenta prsevia 3 Uterine inertia 2 56 Abdominal pains ... ... ... ... ... 5 Rise of temperature ... ... ... ... 10 Eclampsia ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Phlebitis ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Infant jaundiced ... ... ... ... ... 1 Mastitis ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Inflammation of eyes ... ... ... ... 7 Ophthalmia ... ... ... .. ... 2 Death of infant ... ... .. ... ... 6 Still births .. ... ... ... ... 14 Other causes ... ... ... ... ... 15 Of the total 9,194 births registered in the Borough, 3,574 were attended by Certified Midwives attached to the Institutions of the Plaistow Maternity Charity— 2,211 were attended from Howard's Road. 1,363 ,, ,, Lansdowne Road. Infant Mortality.—Much has been done of recent years to inspire interest in the question of providing the best means of combating with the great waste of infant life, and although recent summers, except that of 1911, have been favourable to the newly born, there is little doubt some of the improvement has been the result of painstaking visitation and the steady infusion of knowledge. Infant mortality is usually recorded in comparison with the number of births. The total number of infants who died before they reached the age of one year during 1913 was 984, being 95 more than in 1912. This is equivalent to an infant death-rate of 107 per 1,000 births. The average rate during the past five years 1908-1912 57 was 111 per 1,000 births. Practically one-fifth of these infants die<l within a week of birth, and about one-third within a month. Notification of Births Act, 1907.—The adoption of this Act by the Council on 14th January, 1908, received the sanction of the Local Government Board and came into operation in the Borough on 9th March, 1908. The Act provides for the notification in writing of every birth, whether still-born or otherwise, to the Medical Officer of Health within 36 honrs of its occurrence by the father if he is actually residing in the house or by any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth. The Act also provides for the inspection by the Registrars of Births and Deaths of the register kept or notifications received, and has been of much assistance to the Registrars in enabling them to check false information and false addresses. Every medical practitioner and midwife is supplied with prepaid post-cards as required by the Act, and the following are the figures for the year :— Actual number of births received ... ... 7,916 Duplicate notifications .. ... 32 Still births ... ... ... ... 223 Notifications of births which belonged to other districts ... ... 100 355 Net West Ham births notified... 7,561 Of the total 9,125 West Ham births registered in the year 20-3 were illegitimate, and of the total infant deaths 2-t were illegitimate, 58 Factory and Workshops Act, 1901.—Section 132 provides that the Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall, in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State.

Mr. E. G. Simmons, one of the Inspectors who was appointed for the purposes of the Act under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health having been appointed an Inspector of Nuisances, was succeeded by Mr. E. F. Hughes in February, 1913. Early in the year (7th March), an Act amending the Shops Act received the Royal Assent, whereby the provisions of Section 1 of the Shops Act, 1912, were amended to meet the requirements of refreshment houses. The following Closing Orders and Half-Holidaj' Orders were in operation at the commencement of the year :— (1) Hairdressers' and Barbers' Closing Order, 1909. (2) Butchers' Closing Order, 1912. (3) Grocers', General Shopkeepers' and Provision Dealers' Half-Holiday Order, 1912. (4) Chemists' and Druggists' Half-Holiday Order, 1912. The following additional Order was made during the year :— (5) West Ham Bakers' Half-Holiday Order, 1913, fixing the half-holiday on Thursday at 2 o'clock. The proposed Order specified 1 o'clock, but a petition having been received by the Council suggesting 2 o'clock, a vote was taken in accordance with the provisions of the Act of the Bakers and Pastrycooks, and the Order was made and confirmed by the Home Secretary fixing the hour at 2 o'clock. e 66 With regard to the Chemists' and Druggists' Half-Holiday Order, the Home Secretary confirmed same, but suggested the addition of the words "Medicines and medical and surgical appliances" in Clause 2 of the Order, whereby these commodities are exempt from the provisions of the Order. This suggestion was agreed to. Petitions were received from the Drapers, Milliners, Hosiers, and Mantle Dealers for a Closing Order, and from the Florists and Nurserymen for a Half-Holiday Order, but in both cases the Council, after investigations had been made, made no Order. With reference to the Butchers' Closing Order, the Public Health Committee received Deputations from various Associations connected with that particular trade, the suggestion being that "cooked meat" should be included in the Order made by the Council, but the Committee were unable to recommend the alteration of the Order. There being a considerable element of doubt and misapprehension as to the provisions of the Act, applying both to the various Orders made by the Council and all other shops as to closing immediately preceding and succeeding Christmas, a special advertisement was published by the instructions of the Council setting forth in full detail the provisions of the Act. For the purposes of record, the following is a copy of the advertisement.— SHOPS ACT, 1912. CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. The Public Health Committee, to whom the matter was referred by the Council at their last meeting, have given instructions for the publication of the following statement:— Misapprehension having arisen as to the closing of shops during the week preceding Christmas week and Christmas week, 67 keepers are informed that, in the opinion of the Committee, the following arrangements are permissible: — Hairdressers, Grocers, General Shopkeepers, and Provision Dealers, Chemists, Bakers, In these trades Thursday is fixed as the weekly half-holiday by order, but these shops may remain open on Thursday, 18th December, provided they are closed all day on Christmas Day and also on Saturday, 27th December, after 1 o'clock (Bakers after 2 p.m.), and provided further that from the morning of Monday, 22nd December, to the evening of Saturday, 27th December, a notice is affixed in the shop stating that during that week the day of the weekly half-holiday will be Saturday instead of Thursday. Butchers. These shops may remain open on Monday, 22nd December, provided they remain closed all day on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. All Shops (not exempted by the Shops Act) other than the above, whose ordinary closing day is Thursday. These shops may remain open on Thursday, 18th December (if that is their closing day), provided they remain closed all day on Christmas Day and also on Boxing Day after 1 p.m., and provided further that from the morning of Monday, 22nd December, to the evening of Saturday, 27th December, a notice is affixed in the shop stating that during that week the day of the weekly half-holiday will be Friday, instead of Thursday.
