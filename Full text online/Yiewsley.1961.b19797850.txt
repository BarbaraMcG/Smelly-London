To: The Chairman and Members of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report for the year ending 31st December, 1961, and I trust that it will give you some idea of the work carried out in the department during the year under review. As you are aware, that following my operation in February, I was away on sick leave for the remainder of the year and I wish to take this opportunity to record my thanks to the Chairman and members of the Council for their kind consideration and for the many nice letters and messages of good will received. Dr. L. F. Keenan acteslas temporary Medical Officer of Health during my absence and 1 would like to express my thanks to him for his trouble and for the good work he performed. The mid-year population as estimated by the Registrar General was 23,660, an increase of 320 on last year and the first increase of the estimated population for a few years. The estimated number of inhabited dwellings rose to 6,865 an increase of 438 on 1960. Deaths from all causes totalled 190, giving ar. adjusted death rate of 11.56 per 1,000 population. Live births totalled 456 equal to an adjusted birth rate of 17.3 per 1.000 population. There were no Maternal Deaths. Infantile (Neo-Natal) deaths numbered three and two of these were for extreme Prematurity and the other was due to Haemorrhagic Disease. In general the health of the area was good. There was a mild epidemic of measles, mostly from the under 10 year old group, and 628 cases were notified. 6 Apart from Measles there were very few cases of notifiable disease. No cases of Diphtheria or Poliomyelitis were notified and only eight cases of Food Poisoning, all isolated cases, for which no cause could he traced. The principal cause of death was Coronary disease and Angina— 47 cases. Total number of deaths from Cancer was 37, of which 11 were Lung Cancer. 8 males and 3 females. Infantile deaths (under 1 year) numbered 10. including the three NeoNatal deaths mentioned above and two cases of Congenital Heart disease— the remaining deaths were due to Pneumonia or Pneumonitis. Pulmonary Tuberculosis caused three deaths. The progress of rehousing families from Clearance Areas and Unfit Houses continues. The first Smoke Control Area in the district came into operation on 1st December, 1960, and Area No. 2 on 1st December, 1961. In regard to Health Education. Members of the Public Health Department continue to give lectures to various Organisations and posters are displayed concerning the various aspects of Health Education and also regarding Road Safety. London Airport continues to increase and it is not easy to realise the amount of time and work our Public Health Staff have to cope with on varying duties. In conclusion I wish to thank our Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. Makin. his deputy, Mr. Marshall and all members of the Public Health Staff for their loyalty and assistance. I also wish to express my thanks to the Clerk of the Council, Mr. Boote and Mr. Bradford for their kindness during my sick absence. 7 SECTION A Area in acres 5,276 Total population 1961 (midsummer) (estimated by the Registrar General) 23,660 Estimated number of inhabited dwellings 6,865 Rateable Value (31st March. 1961) £828,340 Product of the Penny Rate 1961/62 £3,781 11 2 VITAL STATISTICS LIVE BIRTHS: Male Female Total Legitimate 211 213 424 Illegitimate 24 8 32 235 221 456 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 estimated population (adjusted): 1961: 17.3 * „ „ „ „ „ „ 1960: 14.94* County of Middlesex: 1961: 16.3 *These figures have been adjusted from 19.27 and 16.9 by the Registrar's Comparability Factor of .90.

The Central Public Health Laboratory atcolindale have also undertaken work in connection with the analysis of food imported into this Country, via London Airport, as most of the imported food arriving at London Docks is also examined by this Laboratory. Reference to work done in connection with this matter can be seen in the chapter on London Airport. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE The responsibility for this service is with the Middlesex County Council and the Medical Officer of Area 8 i.e. the area in which this Urban District is situated, is Dr. O. C. Dobson. There are two clinics in the district, one at 20, High Street, Yiewsley and one in Harmondsworth. There is also a mobile clinic which operates in the Urban District. MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS The Council maintain a register of these establishments operating in the Urban District and the three establishments have been inspected during the year and have had their licences renewed. 12 SECTION C PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES.

To: The Chairman and Members of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1 have pleasure in submitting my report for the year 1961 and must apologise lor the delay in its presentation. Members will appieciate that owing to the absence of Mrs. Taylor, through illness— who I am now pleased to report is back at work— the clerical staff have been seriously handicapped, fn addition clerical assistance has had to be given at the weighbridge office owing to difficulties there There is nothing spectacular to report for the period under ieview but steady progress has been made in all aspects of the work as will be noted from the various sections of the report. I am most grateful to the members of the staff of the department, particularly my deputy, Mr. T. Marshall, for their loyalty and assistance and also to the Clerk of the Council, the Engineer and Surveyor and Tieasurer and their staff for their co-operation with me. SECTION D WATER SUPPLY Water is supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company and typical bacteriological and chemical examination results are shown. It is such a pity in this day and age, when science has shown us all modern marvels of invention, that some means could not be found to soften the water supplied to this area, which although described as moderateiy hard, gives one the sensation of being very hard. Hot water boilers and hot water systems have to be defurred in as little as 2 to 3 years after installation in this area and the Council plumbers are engaged more or less all the time on work involved with cleaning and defurring boilers, pipes and storage tanks connected with hot water systems. 15 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Location Type Residua1 Chlorine p.p.m. Colonies per ml 2 days Colonies per ml 3 days Bact. coli (Type 1) Probable number per 100 ml Presumptive Coliacrogencs Probable number per 100 ml West Drayton P.S.

Number of "Block" control schemes carried out — 26 — 2 28 Once again I report to you on the question of rodent control in your district. This mundane duty as before, includes the bi-annual treatment of sewers in the district by a specialist firm who treat pre-selected points throughout the area. It is considered essential that a cross section of the whole district is treated on each occasion and once again a former notorious black spot in the system showed a nil return. A good dividend for the money spent. It must be appreciated that much slaughter goes on without direct visible evidence as a result of this specialised sewer treatment. As this report is being prepared a treatment of the district is about lo commence. It is not possible to eliminate the rat population entirely and therefore the watchword at all times is vigilance. I am pleased to say that the general level of infestation throughout the district remains low and routine maintenance of the banks of the Duke of Northumberland river is still carried out on behalf of the Middlesex County Council. As before, it is a matter of satisfaction to inform you that no statutory action was necessary in any case of infestation during the year; this speaks well of the co-operation that takes place between the general public and the department. In the matter of rodent control it appears Mr. Citizen is as anxious as the Local Authority that any contravention be dealt with speedily. As a matter of routine control strict watch, has continued and is being maintained on your tips. Much attention is given to this matter at all times. Clearly, any laxity in this direction would quickly result in a serious public health menace arising. Durng the year under review the service has functioned efficiently and all complaints have been dealt with as quickly as possible. 24 FOOD INSPECTIONS Regular inspections of all food premises were carried out during 1961 most being inspected on at least two occasions.

What works were outstanding on 1.4.61 were completed before the close of the year. Meat inspection can now be carried out in much better and enlarged surroundings with adequate natural and artificial lighting being available. A new floor was constructed and the walls rendered in cement mortar. For the humane slaughter of animals a new Stunning pen was fitted for the first time. A system of overhead hanging and runner rails was fitted, and this greatly facilitates the movement of hanging carcases from the Slaughterhall to the cooling and inspection hall. Your Council's Public Health Inspectors carried out 100% inspection of all animals killed and continued to operate the Deadweight Certification Scheme for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The number of pigs weighed and graded totalled 2,876 and the income to the Council was £93 12s. 6d. From a total number of 5,980 animals inspected, it was necessary to condemn 19 cwts. 2 qrs. 2 lbs. of pork, beef, mutton and veal, which was diseased and unfit for consumption. All condemned meat was coloured with an approved dye and sent by arrangement to a local factory for use as a fertiliser. When bacteriological examinations have been required, in order to confirm the Inspectors judgment on a carcase, this has been carried out by the Director of the Pathological Laboratory at Hillingdon Hospital and once more I am grateful for his assistance.

Samples procured in Yiewsley and West Drayton during the year 196I. Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 8 1 Milk (new) 10 - Butter 15 - Cream 4 - Drugs 3 - Fruit (fresh and canned) 16 - Fish and fish products 12 1 Ice Cream 4 - Liver 3 - Meat and Meat Products 11 - Sausages 4 - Vinegar and N.B.C. 11 - Wine and Spirits 6 - Miscellaneous 13 - T otaIs 120 2 The following comments are added in connection with the Food and Drugs Act 1955:— Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 Most of the inspection work carried out under the provisions ot the above Acts is to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders (which relate to the indication of the country of origin of certain goods) are properly observed. Visits of inspection were made lo one hundred and six premises in your district and two hundred and sixty-nine stacks and displays were examined. Only minor infringements, in respect of which the Inspector concerned issued a verbal warning, were detected. The Labelling of Food Order 1953 This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked wilh the name and address of the packer or labeller (or with a registered trade mark); and also to bear on the label its common or usual name together with a list of 32 the ingredients of which it is composed. The Order also controls the manner in which the presence cf vitamins and minerals are disclosed. Sixty premises were visited and three hundred and fifty-nine articles were examined. No infringements were detected. Safe Milk A sample of raw milk procured in your area was tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. It was found to be satisfactory. Eighteen samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured and tested for proper processing and sixteen inspections of premises were made to ensure that miik is kept under satisfactory conditions. Nine licences under the Milk (Spec;al Designation) Regulations 1960 were issued by the County Council. Advertising and Labelling Infringements In addition to the volume of work carried out in Yiewsley and West Drayton many of the samples procured in other parts of the County are foodstuffs and drugs nationally retailed, and this has the effect of protecting the residents of Yiewsley and West Draylon as well as the rest of the County. I summarize below examples of such samples on which action has been taken in 1961. The manufacturer of a non-alcoholic wine was challenged on the ground that the description was a contraduction in terms and the label was amended to "non-alcoholic beverages". The importer of a slimming food was challenged on claims made in advertising literature as to the vitamin concentration claimed to be present, and the literature was subsequently corrected. A manufacturer's claim of slimming properties for "reducing perles" was challenged and the product was withdrawn. The claim relied on the presence of purgatives and bladder wrack. The slimming claim made for a lemon juice in a television advertisement was modified after the manufacturer had been challenged as to the efficiency of the product as a slimming agent. A label on butter "The Creamiest of Butters" was withdrawn after the manufacturer was challenged on the ground that the butter contained' about 82% of fat, not "The Creamiest of Butters" which would be nearer 88% of fat. A "Rum and Butter" candy which contained no rum was objected to. and was re-labelled " Rum Flavour and Butter Candy". An importer was advised that cod caviar was a false description, caviar being the roe of the sturgeon. A sample of cream cheese of Scottish origin was found on analysis to contain 41% of butter fat, this is below the standard of 50% set by several 33 Middlesex Courts. The manufacturer agreed to increase the butter fat content of his cheese to conform to this standard. Another manufacturer was advised that "Mushroms in Creamed Sauce" would be a misleading description because butter fat was absent. A sample of breakfast food which had been procured for analysis was claimed to be "Real Banana Flavour". The flavouring used was in fact artificial. When this was pointed out to the manufacturer he modified the original statement and removed the suggestion that real banana was present. The manufacturer of starch reduced potato crisp agreed to amend the label of his product when challenged on the ground that starch was reduced by only 5% as compared with samples of ordinary potato crisps and that therefore the claim "starch reduced" was misleading. There was one instance of a butter not properly labelled with a prescribed indication of origin; the manufacturer corrected the labels as soon as the infringement was brought to his attention. 34 SECTION G GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH GYPSIES AND DIDlCOITS The problem of dealing with these itinerants presented itself again on many occasions throughout the year. How despairing this problem has become when the policy adopted to “get rid of them” from your own district and move them on elsewhere is quite negative and offers no solution at all. These people are some of the thousands which modern civilisation has either forgotten or does not think as important as rockets or sputniks. They are Society's human cast-offs, Society's flotsom. There is only one solution. They must be absorbed into our Society by being housed decently, so that the next generation of children will not perpetuate this unfortunate way of life. This Council has been willing to shoulder its share of the problem if only other local Authorities would do the same. SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Smoke Control Area No. 2 came into operation on the 1st December. 1961, and by that time the necessary information had been submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for the approval of Smoke Control Area No. 3, which was intended to come into operation about the middle of 1962. Smoke Control Area No. 2 contained 73 acres and was bounded by the High Street, Fairfield Road. Acacia Avenue. Horton Bridge Road and the main line. Western Region, of British Railways. There were 468 domestic dwellings involved, 44 commercial properties and 27 industrial premises. Of the 468 domestic dwellings involved, 155 are Council houses. LONDON AIRPORT The first stage in the transfer of industrial and non-industrial personnel from old type premises on the North Terminal Area lo new premises in the Central Terminal Area took place this year when part of the new passenger building, handling longhaul flights, was opened. This has re- 35 suited in more catering premises being brought into use without any appreciable reduction of the existing use of catering premises on the North Terminal Area. During the year two new landmarks appeared on the North Terminal Area namely the commencement of a large new Aircraft Catering Block for British European Airways and the construction of a new Fire Station for the Ministry of Aviation Fire Service. The new Catering block for British European Airways is essential because the Company's existing premises in the Central Terminal Area are now inadequate to cope with the number of flights the Company need to handle, and attention was drawn to this situation early in the year. The existing aircraft catering premises of British European Airways were built in 1955 and after only 7 years operation, it was essential to rebuild on a larger scale thereby showing the extraordinary rapid growth of the industry. Altnoug'n this is only one example of development, the refuse collection service had to cope with the extra growth, petroleum storage was increased, a new boiler installation was opened to give all the necessary increased water and heating services and all existing catering premises had to cope with an increase in the total number employed on London Airport which is now 31.800 including contractors. An indication of the growth of the various services at London Airport can be reflected in the Passenger and Aircraft Movements since London Airport first started to be used by Civil Aircraft in 1946. Passenger Movement Aircraft Movement 1946 63,151 9,054 1947 281,628 29,590 1948 385,763 33,555 1949 394,796 33,673 1950 523,351 37,766 1951 796,092 49,341 1952 860,760 50,859 1953 1,204,561 62,088 1954 1,724,139 79,649 1955 2,683,605 119,612 1956 3,060,080 122,952 1957 3,513,433 131,160 1958 3,555,509 129,497 1959 4,097,058 129,641 1960 5,380,837 146,605 1961 6,179,238 157,510 36 Food Premises When one considers the extent of communal feeding taking place daily it is gratifying to note that no outbreak of food poisoning took place and this I believe is in no small way due to the regular inspections taking place and the insistence of a high standard of hygiene. 1961 marked the culmination of a long programme by the Ministry to replace woodwork forming drainers, counters and food preparation tables, with hygienic steel units which was requested by the Department, and with few exceptions this has now been effected. This is now regarded as a considerable improvement. The day to day cleaning of the large catering premises on the Airport has always been a problem because most of the canteen and aircraft catering premises operate on a 24-hour service and therefore the premises are never completely closed except during large re-decoration programmes. To cope with this problem it is essential in my view, as it is indeed essential in all large catering premises, to operate a work measurement drill which lists every food room in detail and the equipment in that room, with a frequency and method of cleaning to be adopted in order to secure the best conditions for food handling. Management of canteens are urged at every opportunity to adopt this method, and it is being applied in most cases, with very satisfactory results. Food Inspection The Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations were carried out throughout the year and the total amount of food inspected was 98 tons 12 cwts. 0 qrts. 5 lbs. and 334 visits during the day and night were made for this purpose. Details of the various foods inspected are as follows:- Tons C wts. Qrs. Lbs. Confectionery and Flour Confectionery 1 10 1 25 Fresh Meat 36 0 3 2 Cooked Meat and Meat Products 15 5 1 3 Salami and Other Sausages 16 9 1 12 Fish 3 18 3 15 Shellfish 0 6 1 22 Fruit 1 3 3 21 Vegetables 2 18 0 16 Offal 0 5 0 27 Cheese 2 19 2 18 Miscellaneous 17 13 3 12 37 14 contraventions of the Imported Food Regulations were discovered. 8 consignments were without Official Certificates and the appropriate action taken which resulted in two consignments being re-exported and six consignments being released on. undertakings being given not to use the food for sale for human consumption Six consignments were partly unfit and 151 lbs. of foodstuffs were condemned and destroyed. The bacteriological examinations of imported foods, which was commenced as routine practice in 1958, was again carried out and 12 samples were submitted for analysis to the Public Health Laboratory Service. No pathogenic organisms were found in any of the samples but consignments of a commodity known as Gypsy Pork Roast which is ham, roasted and smoked, have been giving cause for anxiety because of very high bacterial counts found. Unfortunately there is no legal bacteriological standard of either home produced or imported meat or meat products. In such cases where no standard exists the advice of the Public Health Laboratory service is sought and its advice taken. The Importer concerned with the consignment of Gypsy Pork Roast has been warned of the sample results we have been obtaining, and investigations are still proceeding both in this country and the country of origin with the manufactured food concerned. Drinking Water Supplies on Aircraft 51 samples of drinking water were taken from Aircraft during the year and details of these are as follows:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Taken from fixed tank system 11 2 Taken from portable flasks 34 2 Taken from Bowsers 1 - Taken from Mains Water 1 - - 47 4 - — 38 The above results are very satisfactory compared with the previous year's results, and they are especially graitfying because much time has been spent with the several airline operating companies who are responsible for providing a satisfactory drinking water supply, or giving advice and technical assistance in the problems involved in connection with this subject. Petroleum Installations The 4 major aviation fuel storage installations arc completed and licensed, but it is always likely that further extensions will take place to cope with the storage necessary for the ever increasing number of aircraft using the airport. At Perry Oaks, licences are in force for two installations and these licences authorise the storage of 2,433,900 gallons of fuel. In the Central Terminal Area, two licences authorise the storage of 703,000 gallons of fuel. In addition, the pipe lines from Walton now supply both Shell Mex and B.P. and Esso Petroleum at Perry Oaks and also the depot of Shell Mex and B. P. Lt. at Hatton Cross. The lines can pump 30,000 gallons per hour. 39 WEST DRAYTON PRINTING CO. LTD.
