On the 17th March, a letter from the Board was submitted stating that a resolution had . recently been passed by them to submit their surplus lands in the first instance to public auction, and they therefore had no power to treat with the Vestry for the sale of the land, and further stating that in the event of the Vestry undertaking to set back the premises, Nos. 113, 114 and 115, St. Martin's Lane, the Board would contribute one moiety of the cost, whereupon it was resolved to treat with the Marquis of Salisbury for the acquisition of the premises referred to, or as an alternative for the acquirement of the premises at the rear of the Vestry Hall, known as St. Martin's Mews.

HUGHES, Vestry Hall, JOHN McMASTER, Auditors. 30th June, 1887. 81 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1886 Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1886. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Seventeenth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. This year has not been marked by the visitation of any special epidemic, such as small-pox, &c. The deaths were one less than in the preceding year, and the death-rate, after deducting those non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital and adding those parishioners who died in institutions outside the Parish, was less than in the previous year. We may, therefore, congratulate ourselves that sanitary science, the better knowledge and treatment of disease, are tending to the lowering of the death-rate. Of course, we are not perfect—if such a state of things can be attained—but within the last few years great and wonderful progress has been made in reducing the mortality, as the gradual decline in the death-rate of London will show. London, the largest city in the world, can fairly claim to be the healthiest. 82 Some short time since I met an American gentleman who had travelled much, and in the course of conversation he informed me that he considered this metropolis the best kept city he had ever seen. Births. During the year 188G there were registered 356 Births, of which 191 were males, and 165 females. This, with the exception of last year, is the lowest number of the last ten years. The following Table gives the number of Births occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 15 19 34 February 23 13 36 March 17 17 . 34 April 12 12 24 May 7 7 14 June 20 15 35 July 15 12 27 August 19 11 30 September 20 19 39 October 24 9 33 November 10 20 30 December 9 11 20 191 165 356 The Birth-rate of the Parish for the year 1886 was 19.6 per 1,000. The Births registered in London in 1886 numbered 133 700, giving the proportion of 32.3 Births in the year to 1,000 inhabitants. This is the lowest rate on record since 1850, when the rate was 32.0. Deaths. In the year 1886 there were registered 425 Deaths, of which 235 were males, and 190 females; this number is one less than in the previous year. 83 The following Table gives the number of Deaths occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 30 23 53 February 17 21 38 March 40 35 75 April 23 17 40 May 20 12 32 June 20 15 35 July 14 15 29 August 13 9 22 September 15 10 25 October 13 9 22 November 16 15 31 December 14 9 23 235 190 425 Of the above 425 Deaths, 160 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in that Institution, 140 were non-residents in the Parish. In public Institutions situate without the Parish, 52 deaths of Parishioners occurred. Amongst the tables will be found one giving details of those 52 deaths. The Death.rate of the Parish for the year 1886 was 18.2 per 1,000, more than one less than in the previous year. Patio of deaths to population, 1 in 55. The Deaths registered in London during the year 1886 were 82,276, and corresponded to an annual death-rate of 19.9 per 1,000. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish of St. Martin.in.the.Fields, during the last ten years:— 1877 1878 1879 1880 1881 16.9 17.5 18.6 16.8 18.5 f 2 1882 *1883 1884 1885 1886 17.0 19.0 19.7 19.3 18.2 Ages at Death. The ages of the total 425 deaths occurring in the Parish were as follows:— 73 were under 1 year. 46 from 1 to 5 years. 34 „ 5 „ 20 „ 84 „ 20 „ 40 „ 97 „ 40 „ 60 „ 85 ,, 60 „ 80 „ 6 above 80 years. Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The seven principal Zymotic Diseases are Small.pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. In computing the number of deaths from this class of malady, I have this year adopted a different method. In former years I included all those deaths which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital to compensate for those deaths of parishioners who died in public institutions outside the parish, and of which. I was ignorant, until within the last four years, when I have been supplied with quarterly returns of such deaths from the office of the Registrar.General. The revised table No. 5, at the latter part of my Report, will demonstrate my plan, and the number and classification of this class of disease. It will be seen on referring to this table, that in the four years 1883,1884,1885 and 1886, there has been a steady decline in the mortality, with the exception of a rise of 4 in 1886, over that of 1885. Of course all diseases have a tendency to fluctuate from year to year, but at the same time St. Martin.in.the.Fields will compare favourably with other districts. * This is the first year returns have been supplied to me from the Registrar. General's Office of deaths of parishioners occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish, which deaths have been added to the death.rate.—J. J. S. 85 Small-pox.— No death or illness from this disease came to my knowledge. Measles.—Five deaths occurred within the parish, and 1 outside. Scarlet Fever.—No death occurred from this complaint. Five cases were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Hospital, and all recovered. Diphtheria.—Five deaths occurred from this complaint in the Charing Cross Hospital, all non-parishioners, and 1 death of a parishioner occurred in Hospital outside the parish. Whooping Cough.—Eleven deaths were registered in the parish, and 2 outside. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. Four deaths were attributed to this class of malady, 2 of which were non-residents who were admitted into the Charing Cross Hospital. One death of a parishioner occurred in Hospital outside the parish. Diarriœa.—Fifteen deaths were due to Diarrhoea, a number in excess of previous years. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, inclusive of Consumption destroyed 158 The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed in a table further on. Inquests. In the year 1886, there were held 60 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 22 Burns and Scalds 2 Suffocations — Infants when in bed with parents 3 Hanging 3 Carried forward 30 86 Brought forward 30 Poison, Strychnine 1 „ Opium 2 ,, Oxalic Acid 2 „ Chloral 1 ,, Hydrochloric Acid 1 Wound in Throat 2 Drowning 3 Premature Birth 1 Hydrophobia from the bite of a cat 1 Injuries received from falling from window 3 „ ,, ,, „ downstairs 1 ,, „ „ ,, off scaffold 1 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ladder 3 „ ,, „ „ „ an omnibus 1 „ ,, by a passing train when in the Charing Cross tunnel of the District Railway 1 Injuries received when attempting to leave a carriage of a train in motion at Charing Cross District Railway Station 1 Injuries received when attempting to get into a carriage of a train at Waterloo Station 1 Injuries received from being knocked down or run over in the street 3 Injuries received from a falling joist when at work at the National Liberal Club 1 60 Sanitary Work. In the year 1886, 107 notices were served upon the owners or occupiers of property, besides numerous verbal recommendations to remedy nuisances and sanitary defects. One summons was taken out against the owner of a house who disregarded the notice served upon him to perform certain specified sanitary works; the constable was unable to serve the summons, owing to his inability to find the owner. The ground-landlord however caused the house to be 87 vacated and closed, and the premises have since been put into a proper state of repair. Cecil Court.—After some delay and further communications with the ground-landlord and his agent, the remainder of the houses were vacated and closed. The whole of the Court is to be pulled down and re-built. In my fortnightly report of March 4th, I brought under your notice a case of overcrowding, and in so doing pointed out the hardships the poor had to contend with in respect to house accommodation. I addressed you as follows:— "I have to draw your attention to a case of overcrowding on the first floor front at 10, Turner's Court. The cubical contents of the room are 1190 ft. This space, according to the regulations of houses let in lodgings, would accommodate three adults if used for a day and night room, and four adults if used only as a sleeping room. On my visiting the place I ascertained that the room was used as a day and sleeping room, and was occupied by a man, wife, a girl 10 years of age, a boy of 8 years of age, a boy of 7 years of age, a girl of 5 years of age, and a girl nearly 3 years of age, in all 2 adults and 5 children. For this room they paid 4s. 6d, per week, which is equivalent to £11 14s. per annum. Formerly these people rented both back and front rooms, but in consequence of the man's precarious earnings, he was compelled to give up the back room; I should state this man is employed as a porter in Covent Garden Market. I have detailed this case thus fully to show you the crying and urgent necessity of providing the poorer class with decent and wholesome dwellings at a reasonable rent compatible with their means. The rent they now pay for their miserable rooms and accommodation is exorbitant, and when you consider the precarious earnings of the poor, the claim for rent presses very harshly upon them. How can it be expected that children brought up in such surroundings will turn out good men and women?" The above cited case is a type of many thousands in London. With the demolishment of so many houses occupied by the poor, they are driven away to overcrowd other neighbourhoods. What is 88 wanted are wholesome dwellings at a reasonable rent consistent with the scanty earnings of the poor. The Peabody Buildings are admirable and excellent institutions, but they do not meet the means of the poorest class. Bake-Houses. The bake-houses have been duly inspected, and with the exception of one which required lime-whiting, they were all in a cleanly and orderly condition. I could not ascertain that any lad under the age of 18 was employed during the restricted hours, viz., from 9 o'clock at night till 5 o'clock in the morning. Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Inspector, whom you appointed permanent inspector of these houses, has regularly inspected them, and reported to me all sanitary defects that came under his notice. Dusting. During the year 3,360 applications have been made at the Vestry Hall for the removal of dust. This number does not represent the whole of the work done by the contractor—those houses and large establishments where the contractor has certain specified days for its removal, are not included in the above figures. Your Surveyor and Inspector both agree as to the satisfactory and punctual manner in which the work is done. Whilst speaking on the subject of dust removal, I would draw your attention to the inconvenient and improper situations in which dust-bins are placed, often within the house; and when it is considered what refuse is frequently thrown into them, refuse consisting of animal and vegetable matter, which, in the course of decay, sends forth a noxious and offensive effluvia, it will be patent that such an arrangement and practice is highly detrimental to health and comfort. In some parts of the parish the Continental system is adopted, that is, placing the dust in proper receptacles, and every morning at an early hour these are deposited on the pavement, when, the dust-cart passing by, the contents of each are shot into it. It is a pity this salutary measure is not universally adopted. It is to be recommended on the grounds of cleanliness, saving of time and trouble. 89 Food and Drugs Act. Your Analyst under this Act has made 29 analyses. The following' are the samples with the result, of each examination:— 2 samples of bread genuine. 5 „ ,, butter ,, 2 ,, „ coffee ,, 2 ,, ,, tea ,, 2 „ „ mustard ,, 7 „ „ milk ,, 2 „ „ whiskey „ 3 „ „ arrowroot „ 2 ,, „ carbolic acid* 2 „ „ „ powder* The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed, those gullies emitting offensive effluvia have also been flushed with carbolic acid and water, and the several courts and passages in the Parish limewhited. In conclusion I must again bear testimony to the zeal and intelligence of your Inspector in the discharge of his duties, and also acknowledge with thanks the promptitude with which the Relieving Officer of the district keeps me informed of all infectious diseases and nuisances coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street, June, 1887. * These disinfectants used by the "Vestry were found on analysis not up to standard of contract. 90 TABLE I.
