Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1962. The birth rate showed a slight increase, but is still below the national rate. The slow but steady rise in the birth rate in recent years is placing a strain on the maternity,hospital and midwifery services where staff problems are still acute. The proportion of illegitimate births was the highest for 40 years, and this is a matter of some concern. The death rate shows little change from year to year and keeps below the national level. The chief causes of death are cancer, heart disease and cerebral haemorrhage, and acute infections no longer play a significant part in mortality. The infant mortality rate, still-birth rate and maternal mortality rate were all lower than in 1961. Infant deaths continue to be concentrated in the early weeks of life. The prevalence of notifiable infectious diseases in general was low throughout the year. The importation of smallpox from India produced the usual panic rush for vaccination among adults, but it should be noted that the number of babies vaccinated was fewer than in 1961. The response of parents to the facilities for protection of children against smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and poliomyelitis is disappointing. German measles was unusually prevalent during the year and many adults were affected. Special attention had to be given to the protection of women who were in the early stages of pregnancy because of the risk of congenital defects occurring in the baby. Much time and effort continued to be given to work in connection with Smoke Control Areas. The co-operation of the public has been good, and steady progress has been maintained towards completion of the Council's programme. Attention continued to be given to unfit houses and the general maintenance of housing standards. The number of applications for improvement grants is still disappointing, and it is to be hoped that greater use will yet be made of these facilities to modernise otherwise structurally sound houses. Steady improvement can be noted in the design and equipment of food shops, but personal hygiene by food handlers in the home and in trade premises is essential if food poisoning is to be kept under control. Throughout the year I have had generous support from my staff. I would like to thank the Council for their support and my colleagues in other Departments for their co-operation. I remain, Your obedient Servant, A. ANDERSON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 GENERAL STATISTICS Year - 1962 Area in acres 7,261 population (Registrar-General's estimate) 102,680 Number of habitable premises (rate books) 31,068 Number of houses erected during year 177 Rateable value of Borough £2,346,505 Sum represented by a penny rate £9,620 Live Births - male 724 Live Births - female 693 Birth rate per 1,000 population 13.8 Birth rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 18.0 Stillbirths - male 11 Stillbirths - female 12 Stillbirths rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 16.0 Deaths - male 578 Deaths - female 544 Death rate per 1,000 population 10.9 Death rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.9 Infant Mortality rate 20.5 Infant Mortality rate (England and Wales) 20.7 Neo-natal Mortality rate 17.7 perinatal Mortality rate 29.2 Maternal Mortality rate 0.0 Maternal Mortality rate (England and Wales) 0.35 VITAL STATISTICS POPULATION. The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate of the population of the Borough for the year is 102,680. RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable value of the Borough for 1962 was £2,346,505 and the sum represented by a penny rate was £9,620. INHABITATED HOUSES. According to the rate books the number of habitable houses, flats and shops with living accommodation at the end of the year was 31,068. LIVE BIRTHS. The number of li*e births in 1962 was 1,417 as compared with 1,048 in 1961. The birth rate was 13.8 per 1,000 population. The birth rate will vary, apart from other causes, according to the age and sex distribution of the population, and to permit of a true comparison with other areas, the Registrar-General supplies for each local sanitary authority what is called the area comparability factor. When this is applied to the Borough birth rate, the result is 13.8 as compared with the birth rate of 18.0 per 1,000 population for Fngland and Wales. The number of illegitimate births was 91 as compared with 69 in 1961. The proportion of live births which were illegitimate, expressed as a percentage of the total live births, is shown below for recent years: - 1925 - 29 3.9 1950 - 54 4.0 1930 - 34 3.2 1955 - 59 3.8 1935 - 39 2.9 1960 4.4 1940 - 44 4.6 1961 4.9 1945 - 49 5.1 1962 6.3 Of the total live and still births, 70.8% occurred in hospital. STILLBIRTHS. The number of stillbirths in 1962 was 23. The proportion of still births per 1,000 total (live and still) births in recent years is shown below:- No. of Stillbirths Rate per 1,000 total births 1930 -34 214 31.2 1935 - 39 224 29.4 5  No. of Stillbirths Rate per 1,000 total births 1940-44 200 27.7 1945-49 198 23.8 1950-54 129 20.6 1955-59 94 14.8 1960 24 17.1 1961 27 18.8 1962 23 16.0 DEATHS. The deaths of residents of the Borough during 1962 were 1,122 (578 male, 544 female). This represents a death rate for the Borough of 10 9 per 1,000 population. The deaths in any area are influenced by the sex and age distribution of the population, and to permit of a true comparison, the Registrar-General calculates for each local sanitary authority area what is called an area comparability factor. When this is applied to the above Borough rate, the result is 11 6 as compared with a death rate of 11,9 per 1,000 population for England and Wales. The Registrar-General has classified the deaths registered during the year, and the details are given in Tables II; III and IV. The cause of death was certified by the Coroner in 259 cases A progressive change is taking place in the percentage age distribution of deaths, and this is shown in the following table:- 1910-14 1950 54 1955 59 1962 Under 1 year 21.8 2.4 2.2 2.6 1-4 years 8,4 0.5 0.3 0.5 5 - 14 years 3.8 0.5 0.4 0.5 15 - 24 years 3.7 0.8 0.8 0.8 25 - 64 years 30 8 31 6 28, 8 27.2 65 years and over 31.5 64,3 67.5 68.4 Th6 chief causes of death were heart and circulatory diseases; cancer, bronchitis and pneumonia, cerebral haemorrhage. In females 54 per cent, of deaths occurred at age 75 years and over as compared with 35 per cent, in males. The Secretary of the Road Safety Committee informs me that during 1962 there were in the Borough 749 road accidents which resulted in 11 deaths, serious injury to 169 persons and slight injury to 728 persons. The number of deaths from motor vehicle and other accidents in Borough residents during the last ten years is shown below:- Year Motor Vehicle Accidents Age in years Other Accidents Age in years 0-4 5-14 15-64 65 All ages 0-4 5-14 15-64 65 All ages 1953 - - 9 8 17 - - 5 15 20 1954 - 1 9 3 13 1 - 13 23 1955 - - 7 7 14 - 1 4 13 18 1956 - 2 9 6 17 - - 11 8 19 1957 1 - 5 4 10 2 - 1 15 18 1958 1 2 10 4 17 - - 7 9 16 1959 - 1 5 8 14 1 - 7 8 16 1960 - 1 11 5 17 - - 6 10 16 1961 - 1 10 8 19 1 1 4 4 7 13 1962 1 - 6 3 10 - 2 10 11 23 Total 3 8 81 56 148 5 4 64 109 182 It should be noted that 38 per cent, of these road deaths occurred in persons aged 65 years and over as compared with 60 per cent, for the same age group in deaths from other accidents. 6 Care and attention in the home, in the factory and on the roads is essential and the special proneness to accidents of the aged should be remembered. INFANT MORTALITY. During 1962 there were 29 deaths of children under the age of 1 year. This represents an infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births of 20.5 as compared with 20.7 for England and Wales. The causes of infant deaths are shown in Table V. In the following table, the change in the local infant mortality rate over 5 vear neriods from 1898 is shown:- No. of live births No. of deaths under 1 year Infant Mortality rate 1898-1902 4,369 698 160 1903-1907 5,264 665 126 1908-1912 5,383 590 110 1913-1917 4,661 461 99 1918-1922 4,326 327 76 1923-1927 4,333 271 63 1928-1932 6,055 318 53 1933-1937 7,121 313 44 1938-1942 6,912 393 57 1943-1947 8,210 345 42 1948-1952 6,680 146 22 1953-1957 6,157 134 22 1958 1,264 21 17 1959 1,275 21 17 1960 1,376 25 18 1961 1,408 35 25 1962 1,417 29 21 These infant deaths can be viewed more closely by looking at the rates according to age at death:- Total infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births (deaths under 1 year) 20.5 Neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births (deaths under 4 weeks) 16.0 Early neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births (deaths under 1 week) 13.4 These rates show the concentration of infant deaths into the early weeks of life. This year 65 per cent, of these deaths occurred before the baby had reached the age of one week. Methods of prevention of congenital malformations, prematurity and associated conditions are still being sought. The infant mortality rate of illegitimate infants was Nil compared with 21.9 for legitimate infants. It is thought that the same factors are probably in operation in relation to stillbirths and early infant deaths, and that it is a matter of degree or chance whether the child dies before or soon after birth. This loss of infant life can be expressed collectively in what is called the perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths and deaths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and still births). For 1962 the Borough perinatal mortality rate was 29,2. MATERNAL MORTALITY. No death was due to causes associated with pregnancy and childbirth. 7 Maternal deaths are usually divided into those due to septic infection and ose due to diseases and other conditions associated with pregnancy and labour, and he local trend of deaths from these two causes is shown below:- Maternal deaths per 1 000 total (live and still births) Sepsis Other Causes Total 1930-1934 2.6 1 7 4.4 1935-1939 1.0 2 1 3.1 1940-1944 0.7 1.2 1.9 1945-1949 0.2 12 1.4 1950-1954 - 0 3 0.3 1955-1959 - 0 2 0 2 1960 - - - 1961 - 0.7 0.7 1962 - - - INFECTIOUS DISEASE Notification to the Medical Officer of Health is the essential preliminary to control of infectious disease The diseases required by statute to be notified are smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, scarlet fever, typhus fever., typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, relapsing fever,> plague, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, malaria, dysentery, puerperal pyrexia, ophthalmia neonatorum, acute primary pneumonia, acute influenzal pneumonia, whooping cough measles, acute encephalitis, meningococcal infection, anthrax and food poisoning It is known that all cases are not notified, but there are no grounds for suspecting that the level of notification varies to any great extent from year to year PersQps travelling overseas may be required to produce evidence of recent vaccination against smallpox or inoculation against yellow fever, cholera and typhoid fever Such certificates require to be endorsed by the Medical Officer of Health and during the year 5,195 were so endorsed INCIDENCE OF NOTIFIABLE DISEASE The number of cases notified during the year is shown in Table VI and the trend of infectious diseases during the last 20 years in Table VII SMALLPOX No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during 1962 Persons arriving in the Borough from parts of the world where smallpox is prevalent, are kept under observation till any chance of their developing the disease is over. According to the returns 671 children under the age of one year were vaccinated in 1962 as compared with 794 in 1961. Modern travel is such that the risk of importing smallpox is ever present SCARLET F15VER This disease was less prevalent 22 cases notified as compared with 29 in the previous year This disease continued to be mild in character DIPHTHERIA The Borough's freedom from diphtheria was maintained during the year. The number of children under the age of one year who were immunised during 1962 was 451 as compared with 482 in 1961 ERYSIPELAS Six notifications of this disease were received. PNEUMONIA Notifications of pneumonia were 14 as compared with 17 in 1961 Of the total pneumonia deaths, 85 per cent occurred at age 65 and over, MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION Two cases were notified during the year. ACUTE ENCEPHALITIS. Qne notification was received and the patient made a good recovery Encephalitis is known to occur as a complication of other infectious diseases, and one such case was notified during 1962 POLIOMYELITIS No case was notified during the year. Inoculation against poliomyelitis was continued during the year and the use of oral vaccine was started Three doses of oral vaccine were given to 959 persons, one 8 dose following two injections to 2,223 persons, 2 injections to 992 persons and third injections to 1,689 persons TYPHOID FEVER One case of typhoid fever was notified during the year and the infection was contracted abroad. PARATYPHOID FEVER No notification was received during the year DYSENTERY This disease shows great variations in prevalence from year to year and from place to place During the year 42 cases were notified The infection in all cases was of the Sonne type and the illness was mild in practically every case. The mildness of the illness is such tha.t medical advice is not always sought, and unless the disease is kept constantly in mind, cases are likely to be missed. TUBERCULOSIS During the year 28 notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis, and 5 notifications of non-pulmonary tuberculosis were received Persons continue to be certified as dying from tuberculosis who have not been notified during life, but it is hoped that with the improved facilities for diagnosis and treatment now available, any reluctance to seek investigation and treatment will disappear. The trend of the Borough death rate from tuberculosis is shown below;- Tuberculosis Death Rate per 100,000 Population Pulmonary Non-pulmonary Total 1930-1934 67.5 11.5 78.9 1935-1939 52.3 8.2 60. 4 1940-1944 55.8 7. 4 63.2 1945-1949 39.1 6.7 45. 8 1950-1954 18.9 1.1 20.0 1955-1959 8.4 0.3 8.7 1960 3.8 0.0 3 8 1961 10.7 0.0 10.7 1962 3.9 1.0 4.9 A permanent mass X-ray unit has been established at West Middlesex Hospital and is open to the public without appointment During the year 747 children were inoculated with B. C. G. vaccine as a protection against tuberculosis OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM Three cases were notified during the year. All occurred in hospital PUERPERAL PYREXIA During the year 95 cases were notified as compared with 122 cases in 1961 No woman died from puerperal or post-abortion sepsis and none of the infections was severe. All the cases, except one, arose in hospital MEASLES This was not a year of measles prevalence and 207 cases were notified as compared with 1,437 in 1961. WHOOPING COUGH- There were 3 cases of whooping cough notified as compared with 14 cases in 1961. Facilities for immunisation against this disease are available, and 380 babies were inoculated The condition is most fatal in young babies, and protection should be provided before the child is six months old There is evidence that the protection, if not complete, does mitigate the severity of the attack, MALARIA No case of malaria was notified during the year INFLUENZA. Influenza caused 9 deaths as compared with 7 deaths in 1961- MUMPS, CHICKEN POX GERMAN MEASLES. These diseases are not notifiable, but cases are brought to the notice of the Department through schools, health visitors, 9 etc. During the year, the following cases were recorded: Mumps 80 Chicken pox 269, and German Measles 899 FEVER HOSPITALS The Borough is served by the South Middlesex Infectious Diseases Hospital, but on occasion, accommodation in other fever hospitals of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board is used During the year, 141 patients from the Borough were admitted to these hospitals. Close contact is maintained between the hospitals and the Health Department, so that any necessary action can be taken DISINFECTION. The disinfection of bedding, etc in cases of smallpox is done at the South Middlesex Infectious Diseases Hospital, while the disinfection of homes and bedding in other cases, is carried out by the disinfectors on the Health Department staff During the year 2 rooms and 2 lots of bedding were disinfected and 7 lots destroyed. Two lots of clothing were disinfected before being sent abroad LABORATORY Certain routine bacteriological work is done in the laboratory at the Health Department When more detailed investigation is required, specimens are sept to the National Public Health Laboratory Service The number of specimens examined, during 1962 was 390 The number of specimens sent to the laboratory is governed largely by the incidence of gastro-intestinal illnesses FOOD POISONING During 1962 notifications of the occurrence of food poisoning in 24 persons were received but after investigation only 6 were accepted as food ppisoning In no case was the infecting organism isolated No death was associated with food poisoning During the year salmonella infection, not food borne, was found in 2 persons.

In addition to the work recorded in other paragraphs of this Report, the Public Health Inspectors continued their general duties of investigating complaints, abating nuisances and dealing with contraventions of the Public Health Acts. Not all complaints brought to the Health Department deal with matters on which the Department is empowered to take action, and in such cases complainants are advised as far as is known, how and where the matter may receive attention. Some particulars of the work done are shown below - Number of complaints received 690 Number of premises at which nuisance etc. were located 630 Number of premises where nuisances abated or defects remedied.- (a) by owners or occupiers 226 (b) by Council in default 1 (c) public sewers repaired by Council 45 (d) public sewers cleared and cleansed by Council 194 Informal notices issued 269 Written reminders issued 188 Statutory notices served 57 Total number of inspections and re-inspections 17,773 Inspections of piggeries 2 Inspections of stables 14 Inspection of urinals 14 Visits re infectious diseases, etc 434 Sinks provided or repaired 8 Roofs repaired 57 14 Gutters repaired or renewed 70 Brickwork, sills, etc. repaired or renewed 123 Premises provided with damp-proof courses 6 Yards and forecourts paved or drained 12 External painting 12 Rooms stripped, cleansed and redecorated 76 Floors, walls anjj ceilings repaired or renewed 185 Rooms in which ventilation provided or improved 8 Rooms in which lighting provided or improved 2 Windows repaired or renewed 146 Doors and other woodwork repaired or renewed 66 Staircases replaced or repaired 4 Lighting to staircases provided or improved 7 Handrails or balusters repaired or renewed 5 Grates provided or repaired 24 Washing coppers provided or repaired 1 Instances where ventilation under floor provided or improved 21 Food stores provided or repaired 11 Domestic cleansing enforced 2 Verminous condition abated 7 Improper keeping of animals abated 4 Offensive accumulations removed 58 Other repairs carried out or nuisances abated 89 Pigstyes repaired 4 Complaints continue to be received of nuisance caused by pigeons. The Public Health Act, 1961, now gives a local authority power 'to take steps for the purpose of abating onmitigatingany nuisance, annoyance or damage caused by the congregation in any built-up area of house doves or pigeons or of starlings or sparrows'. The seizure and destruction of any birds must be carried out humanely and any action' taken must not contravene the Protection of Birds Act, 1954. Action taken at 18 sites in the Borough resulted in the destruction of 203 pigeons, but while food is liberally provided by the public, there is little prospect of keeping the numbers down. EXCHANGF OF ARTICLES FOR FAGS. Under the Public Health Act, 1961, it is an offence for any person who collects or deals in rags, etc. to sell or deliver whether gratuitously or not, any article whatsoever to a child under the age of 14 years in exchange for rags, etc. The Police notify the Council of any such contraventions coming to their notice. CLEAN AIR. During the year the Public Health Inspectors made 55 smoke observations and paid many visits to premises in regard to which complaints of smoke nuisance had been received. Two notices were served under Section 30 of the Clean Air Act, 1956. The Council continues to co-operate with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research by measuring atmospheric pollution in the Borough and forwarding monthly returns. The monthly average, highest daily reading and lowest daily reading are shown in the table on page 16. The point to be noted is the wide range of pollution that can occur. To date the indications are that these wide variations are linked to meteorological conditions and the influence of fog is shown in the month of December. Work continued on the Council's programme of Smoke Control Orders and progress to 31st December, 1962, is shown in the table. Area No. 3 consists largely of Council houses and though considerable work had been done, full details are not yet available. 15 RESULTS OF VOLUMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Smoke (Micrograms per cu metre): Sulphur Dioxide (Micrograms per cu. metre) HEALTH DEPARTMENT HEST0N CLINIC ISLEW0RTH CLINIC HARLEQUIN AVENUE Smoke SO 2 Smoke SO. 2 Smoke S.O.2 Smoke S.O.2 m. a. h. d r l d r. m a. h. d. r 1. d. r. m a. h. d r 1. d. r. m. a. h. d r. 1. d.r. m a. h. d. r l. d r. m a. h d r 1. d. r. m a. h d. r. l.d r m a. h d r. 1. d r January 142 670 30 207 838 57 123 530 20 124 754 20 122 600 30 210 844 74 132 490 30 211 706 80 February 112 450 30 180 489 51 114 590 20 130 363 31 96 320 20 184 513 71 113 430 40 182 526 46 March 148 410 30 179 437 45 114 360 30 158 486 57 95 320 30 183 509 68 118 420 40 201 526 51 April 54 130 10 128 446 22 50 140 10 94 308 34 53 140 20 130 503 48 61 140 10 143 417 37 May 34 110 10 75 197 29 26 90 10 63 186 20 38 136 10 87 220 34 47 140 20 90 252 29 June 23 50 10 87 275 17 20 50 10 58 149 20 18 40 10 79 214 34 32 70 10 89 223 31 July 23 60 nil 73 183 29 23 50 10 55 154 20 27 10 70 81 235 34 38 70 10 86 215 31 August 17 50 nil 39 125 17 20 60 10 31 114 14 21 70 10 53 163 28 29 80 10 57 134 25 September 35 110 10 58 166 23 39 100 10 49 109 23 41 140 10 75 163 37 51 130 20 71 154 37 October 130 440 20 197 789 66 106 390 nil 160 500 37 122 380 20 237 858 69 127 380 42 235 761 63 November 208 540 50 245 512 80 180 430 50 212 1163 40 163 360 40 290 566 89 180 480 50 300 689 132 December 347 1140 40 636 2565 71 213 1120 30 570 2505 46 286 1080 40 802 3406 94 295 1160 40 703 2748 94 m a. - monthly average h.d. r - highest daily reading 1 dr - lowest daily reading 16 SMOKE CONTROL AREAS No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 No. 4 No. 5 No. 6 Council resolution 25.11,58 7-12,59 27.6.61 28.11.61 27.3 62 25.9.62 Ministry enquiry 7. 4.59 14 4 60 - - - - Ministry confirmation 25. 6.59 15.8.60 31.10.61 23.3.62 15.6.62 27.12.62 Date of operation 1.10.60 1 61 1 10.62 1.10.62 1.10,63 1.10.63 Acres 186 130 335 200 100 365 Total dwellings 1,602 1,060 804 1,141 880 987 Council houses 418 5 682 182 - 379 Estimated number of dwellings ranking for grant 1,370 911 739 979 773 766 Number of dwellings where estimates of cost of conversion or adaptation were approved 1,147 561 644 415 22 Number of claims for grant checked and approved for payment 1,062 517 6 224 8 Gross cost to 31.12.62 Nature of works £14,336 £8,700 £137 £5,654 £281 carried out:- (a) new appliances 974 632 7 358 13 - (b) adaptation of existing applianc es 445 200 2 42 4 _ (c) gas or electric kindling provided 757 399 9 262 12 - TENTS, VANS AND CARAVANS. There are six sites in the Borough which have been used as caravan sites for many years. Some are occupied wholly or in part by persons who use caravans for business in connection with a travelling circus, fair or stall. Eight other sites are occupied by one or more caravans. During the year, the inspectors made 574 visits of inspection because of the occupation of land by caravans. Trespass by caravans on road verges and unfenced land continues especially on the western outskirts of the Borough. The vagrant type who occupy these caravans deposit domestic refuse, litter of all kinds, waste water and faecal matter in the neighbourhood of the sites occupied. Much time and effort have been given in attempts to clear them from their usual camping sites, but only too often within 24 hours they are back again. Under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, I960, two site licences were issued for a limited period. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. There is no common lodging house in the Borough. CANAL BOATS. The Public Health Inspectors continued their duties as canal boat inspectors, and made 11 inspections during the year. FACTORIES, WORK-PLACES, ETC. The Factories Act placed on the Council certain duties in regard to (a) outworkers; (b) employment of persons in unwholesome premises; (c) basement bakehouses; (d) provision of sanitary conveniences in all factories, and (e) cleanliness, over-crowding, ventilation and drainage of floors in the case of factories in which mechanical power is not used. A summary of the work done is given below and in Table IX- - Inspection of (a) Factories - mechanical power 365 (b) Factories - non-mechanical power 19 (c) Other premises 158 (d) Outworkers' premises 88 Defects remedied 11 17 At the end of the year the number of outworkers registered with the Department was 245 and the trades on which they were engaged are shown in Table IX. DISINFESTATION, The Health Department deals with bug and other infestations in houses and other premises, and for this purpose D.D.T. and other insecticides are used. During the year, 62 rooms were treated, while 33 wasp nests were destroyed, 8 premises cleared of cockroaches, 6 cleared of ants and 15 of other insects. Treatment of ponds and tanks to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes was carried out as necessary. It is pleasing to record that in the Borough bug-infestations have become a rarity, and activity in this sphere is now concerned more with the extermination of other insects. NOISE NUISANCE. The sources of noises which were the subject of complaint to the Department during the year were:- Factories, industrial premises, etc. 12 Private machinery 2 Brivate wireless sets 2 Loudspeaker 2 Barking dog 1 Shops 1 Wood sawing in street 1 General noise of occupants of houses 4 In all cases, investigation showed some justification for the complaint. With the co-operation of the persons concerned the nuisance was remedied or abated except in one case where the remedy had to await the cessation of the work. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION ETC. The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act. 1949 places the responsibility on the Council to keep their area as far as practicable free from rats and mice' and occupiers of premises are required to give notice when they have knowledge that rats and mice are present in substantial numbers. It is obligatory on the Council to recover the expenses reasonably incurred in taking steps for the destruction of rats and mice on business premises, but permissive as far as the cost of treating private dwellings is concerned. The Council has decided to make no charge for the treatment of private dwelling-houses unless there is failure on the part of the owner or occupier to co-operate in preventing infestation. The Council employs a Rodent Officer who is responsible for systematic inspection, planning of treatment, supervising the work of the rodent operatives and checking results. A summary of the work done in recent years is shown below:- 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 Complaints received 676 803 652 846* 693 Block inspections 93 95 120 107 88 Individual inspections and re-inspections 4,631 5.183 5,516 5,634 5, 766 Other Visits 720 663 693 551 142 Premises treated - (a) By occupier 18 31 26 20 - (b) By local authority 1,191 1. 318 1, 145 1,314 1,236 Test baiting and. where necessary, treatment is carried out to sewers, watercourses, tips, etc. Destruction of part of the rat population by chenftcal or other poisoning may increase the food supply and improve the chances of survival of the remainder. Eradication requires environmental conditions which hinder survival, i.e., no food and no shelter and occupiers of premises should bear this in mind. SHOPS ACT 1950, SECTION 38. Shops require to be reasonably ventilated, heated and lighted, and there should be suitable and sufficient sanitary and washing facilities for the persons employed therin. In this connection 4 inspections were nade during the year. No certificate of exemption re provision of sanitary accommodation was granted. 18 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER PILLING MATFRIALS ACT, 1951 This Act is designed to ensure that filling materials used in upholstery, etc. comply with prescribed conditions of cleanliness. Premises using filling materials have to be registered and premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored have to be licensed. It is an offence to sell articles containing unclean materials. Certain records have to be kept on registered and licensed premises and authorised officers of a local authority have powers to enter, inspect and take samples. Under this Act, one premises in the Borough is registered and the Public Health Inspectors made 2 visits of inspection. SWIMMING BATHS. Three swimming baths are provided by the Council. The size andextent of usage of the three municipal baths are shown below:- Hounslow Heston Isleworth Area of bath major 75' x 30' 100" x 48" 100" x 48" minor 50" x 25" - - Capacity of bath (gallons) major 71,000 200,000 200,000 minor 36,000 - - Total number of persons using swimming bath in 1962 156, 809 235,498 164,390 Maximum number of persons using swimming bath on any one day 892 1, 762 1,072 No. of private baths male 15 - 11 female 9 - 11 No. of persons using private baths during 1962 32,773 19,651 The baths waters are treated by continuous filtration and breakpoint chlorination. While baths' staff do everything to maintain a ;safe* standard of bath water, bathers could assist very materially by the observance of strict personal hygiene. During the year 5 samples of baths water were taken and all were found to be satisfactory. VERMINOUS PREMISES .AND ARTICLES, On request., two houses and their contents were treated for verminous infestation. VFRMINOUS PERSONS. No verminous person was cleansed under the provisions of Section 85 of the Public Health Act, 1936. During the year 35 children in attendance at schools in the Borough were found to be verminous and because of the failure of parents to take necessary action 8 of these children had to be cleansed by the School Health Department. PFT ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act is designed to regulate the sale of pet animals and the main provision is that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Under the provisions of this Act 7 premises in the Borough have been licensed and 20 visits of inspection were made during the year. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD MILK. At the end of the year, there were 51 distributors registered under the Milk and Dairies Regulations. During the year 49 inspections were made at dairies and retail purveyors' premises The Milk (Special Designation) (Special Areas) Order, 1951, came into operation °n 1st October, 1951 This Order defined the County of Middlesex as an area in which the use of a, special designation becomes obligatory for the purpose of all sales of Blilk by retail for human consumption (other than a catering sale). The special designations permitted are 'sterilised' , 'pasteurised* and 'tuberculin tested' . 19 I Nine complaints were received of dirty milk bottles. In one case, proceedings resulted in a fine of £3 with 5 guineas costs. ICE CREAM. Under the Food and Drugs Act. premises used for the sale or the manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice-cream, or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale must be registered. This does not apply to premises used primarily as a club, hotel, inn or restaurant and only to a theatre, cinematograph theatre, music hall or concert hall if the ice-cream is manufactured on the premises. The number of premises registered at the end of the year was 255. The Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations require all ice-cream except complete cold-mix powders, to be heat treated with a view to killing any pathogenic orginisms which may be present and lay down the temperatures at which mixtures are to be kept before and after heat trelatment - theap temperatures are such as to discourage bacterial growth. The Regulations also require that ice-cream shall be protected from dirt, dust or other contamination. The enforcement of these Regulations calls for regular and persistent supervision of premises, plant and methods of manufacturing and handling. During the year, 117 inspections of registered premises were carried out. The following results were obtained from the bacteriological examination of samples:- Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Ice-Cream 44 1 3 The percentage of doubtful and unsatisfactory samples was 8,0 as compared with 15. 0 in 1961. BAKEHOUSES. There are 18 bakehouses in the Borough and 44 visits of inspection were made during the year. SLAUGHTERHOUSES.

Subsequent follow-up samples taken have been satisfactory Two samples of milk procured from churns delivered to a dairy were found to be low in solids-not-fat. The two churns were part of a larger consignment and it was found that the quality of the whole of the milk sent by the farm was of satisfactory quality. One sample of butter was found to contain 16 2 per cent- of water, whereas the maximum permissible is 16 per cent. As follow-up samples were found to be satisfactory no action was taken in respect of the unsatisfactory sample A firm of bakers was prosecuted for selling cakes as 'real dairy cream cakes when in fact the cream was a mixture of dairy cream and imitation cream The firm was prosecuted and was fined four pounds and ordered to pay six guineas towards the costs A sample of frozen blackcurrants was found to contain sulphur dioxide (a preservative). Subsequent samples were satisfactory Sulphur dioxide was also found to be present in a sample of chipped potatoes which were procured prior to the coming into force of the 1962 Preservative in Pood Regulations This appeared to be an isolated instance and, having regard to the coming into force of new regulations which would have permitted the presence of sulphur dioxide, no action was taken Three samples of Clementines described by the greengrocers selling them as 'seedless' were found to contain large numbers of seeds An official caution was sent to the greengrocers concerned In addition to samples purchased in the Borough, labelled stacks and displays of fish (68), meat (131), apples (140), citrus fruit (29), vegetables and potatoes (16), and offals (14), were examined in 172 shops Inspection of meat delivered to a school kitchen was also made A caution was sent to the butcher who supplied silverside of beef invoiced as topside, and a quantity of mince which appeared to be sour The Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 - 1953 inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication qf origin of imported foodstuffs are applied, inspections were made at 295 premises, and 95 stacks and displays of meat, 342 of apples, 141 of tomatoes, 22 of poultry, 222 of butter, 107 of dried fruit, and 13 other miscellaneous foods were examined for compliance with the Orders. No serious infringement was disclosed, minor infringements being dealt with by warnings One of the Orders relating to imported foodstuffs requires, (in the case of honey), that advertisements for honey shall include the statement of origin A honey manufacturer in your area was sent a letter of warning as it was found that advertisements published by the company did not include this information. Safe Milk Fifty-four samples of raw milk were procured in your Borough and tested for the presence of tubercle baccili All were satisfactory. Fifty-seven samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured from retailers in the Borough and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed No failure has been reported Sixtythree inspections of premises at which milk is pasteurised or at which it is sold were carried out during the year to ensure that the premises concerned conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 The Labelling of Food Order, 1953 This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark to be marked with its 22 common or usual name or its appropriate designation; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed A total of 177 premises have been visited in connection with the Order, and 1,196 articles of food have been examined. No infringements were disclosed " FOOD HYGIENE- The work of promoting sound standards of hygiene in food premises has been steadily pursued. As far as possible, the plans of all premises which will be associated with the preparation and sale of food are examined In this way it is possible to influence the standard of premises and equipment and consultation on these matters is welcomed Visits of inspection were paid with a view of securing 'clean food, handled by clean hands and transported, prepared and stored under clean conditions' . As a result of these visits contraventions of the pood Hygiene Regulations were found at 67 premises and were remedied at 77 premises during the year. Some particulars of the contraventions found and remedied are given below. The figures for remedied items include works carried out voluntarily without notice and contraventions remedied immediately on verbal intimation at the time of inspection. Contraventions of Food Hygiene Regulations Found Remedied Articles/Equipment not kept clean 4 30 Articles/Equipment not in good order 8 12 Containers not protected fron contamination 1 44 Pood so placed as to involve risk of contamination 10 30 Pood placed within 18" of ground and not adequately protected _ 56 Personal cleanliness not observed - 1 Water closets not kept clean and in efficient order 15 10 Insufficient lighting and ventilation to water closets 5 1 Absence of 'Wash your Hands notice in water closets 2 1 Improper wrapping materials used - 2 Absence of suitable and sufficient wash-hand basins 4 5 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over wash-hand basins 15 17 Absence of soap, nail brushes, clean towels, etc near wash-hand basins 3 20 Absence of first aid materials 2 - Absence of accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours 2 2 Absence of suitable and sufficient sinks for the washing of food and equipment _ 2 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over sink 2 2 Absence of soap, clean cloths etc. at sink - 2 Absence of suitable and sufficient lighting in food rooms . 1 Absence of suitable and sufficient ventilation in food rooms i 3 Walls, floors, etc. not kept clean 43 105 Walls, floors, etc not kept in good order 34 22 Covered receptacle for refuse not provided 2 19 Accumulations of refuse, etc. 3 21 Inadequate trapping of drain inlets - 1 Miscellaneous 10 9 166 418 There is a continuing need for vigilance in connection with unhygienic practices and personal habits among food handlers. 23 What action is to be taken concerning unfit houses is governed by the cost of the necessary works Unless the house 'is capable at reasonable expense of being rendered fit' action must be in the direction of closing or demolition 'Reasonable expense' has never been defined and with restrictions on rents and the high cost of repairs, its interpretation is far from easy, but the Housing Act, 1957 has now defined the matters to be taken into consideration in assessing fitness for human habitation. The action taken in insanitary and unfit dwelling houses during the year is summarised as follows - 1.

During the year the Council approved expenditure as under:- (a) advances of £604,430 for house purchase under the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958 in relation to 253 houses. (b) improvement grants of £12,783 under section 30 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958 in relation to 41 houses.

The first has been confirmed by the Minister and a decision on the second is awaited. 26 GENERAL MATTERS BURIALS Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the Council to arrange the burial of any person who has died in the district, where it appears that there are no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body During 1962 one burial was arranged in accordance with this section. PUBLIC MORTUARY. The public mortuary situated in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church, has been demolished. The premises were cut-of-date and unsuitable for postmortem examination or the retention of a body for other than a very short time By arrangement with the Coroner, bodies are taken direct to Acton or Hampton Mortuaries The Council pays a charge made for the use of these mortuaries. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF For superannuation or other purposes 134 members of the Council's staff were referred to the Health Department for medical examination. HFALTH EDUCATION Posters issued by the Central Council for Health Education continued to be displayed on the boards formerly used by the Empire Marketing Board During the year, the Medical officer of Health gave talks to several organisations in the Borough on various aspects of the health services The Chief Public Health Inspector engaged in similar activities particularly in those parts of the Borough affected by Smoke Control Orders. The staff are fully aware of the opportunities given by their contact with the people for drawing attention to matters bearing on health and hygiene. Other Departments have co-operated by displaying health educational material PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places the responsibility on the Council of taking action to secure 'the necessary care and attention for persons who:- (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention". Despite the growing interest of statutory and voluntary agencies in the welfare of the aged, cases come to the notice of the Department of neglected aged persons living in insanitary conditions. Such persons are usually most reluctant to accept assistance or to go to hospital or institution, but fortunately, in most cases, peaceful persuasion secures their co-operation in some degree and the necessary action can be taken in no case was it necessary to seek authority to apply for an Order for compulsory removal to hospital or institution LAUNDRY SERVICE. One of the problems in the care of aged and sick persons in their own homes is soiled clothing and bed linen. Where washing facilities are poor and the persons concerned neither have nor can afford assistance, the cleansing of clothing and bedding presents serious difficulty. In some cases, action under Section 84 of the Public Health Act, 1936, is the only solution and the Council has made arrangements with a laundry firm for the cleansing of articles where the Medical Officer of Health has issued the certificates required by the Act. The number of cases participating in this service is increasing.
