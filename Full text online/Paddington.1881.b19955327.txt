Paddington. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 18 8 2. PADDINGTON. The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Grate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board it returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (the third Tuesday in August, and the first Tuesday in September excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow; viz.:— WARD ONE. All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 WARD TWO. All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite the West end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and 1 hence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD THREE. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbcurne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD FOUR. All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Borough of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 15 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Saviour's, „ John's, „ Michael and All Angels, „ Mary's, Christ Church, Holy Trinity, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Paul's, „ Peter's, All Saints', „ Stephen's, St. Matthew's, „ Augustine's. „ Luke's, 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines; Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George,Hanover Square,and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board meeting at the Vestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar-General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Vestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.:—the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company.

By order, FRANK DETHRIDGE, Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, Vestry Clerk. June 12th, 1882. REPORT of the WORKS EXECUTED in the PAYING & SEWERS DEPARTMENTS, by GEORGE F. STEVENS, Surveyor. to the VESTRY OF PADDINGTON Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, 30th June, 1882. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Annual Report on the various works executed, and the general business transacted in your Surveyor's Department during the Year ended Lady-day, 1882. Highways. The removal of macadamized roadways, and a substitution by wood blocks on a Portland cement concrete foundation, have been further carried out, namely, in— Harrow Road, from Green Street to North Wharf Road. Chester Place. Hyde Park Square, on South Side. Edgware Road, from Praed Street to Maida Hill West. 16 Church Street. Porchester Road, from Bishop's Road to Westbourne Park Villas. Westbourne Street. Sussex Gardens West, and South Wharf Road, from the Bank of England Tavern to Praed Street. The total number of superficial yards of concrete and wood pavement laid therein is 27,371, and the net cost is £12,118 17s. 10d., or about 8s. 10¼d. per yard, after deducting the value of the old road materials used for repairing various streets in the Parish. The breaking up of the macadamized roads and preparing the ground to receive the concrete and wood blocks, and the laying thereof, including all incidental works in connection therewith, were again executed by the Vestry's officers and workmen under my directions. The area of wood pavement laid down in this Parish, during the last five years, is 65,162 square yards, and in extent is equal to 3 miles 5 furlongs and 136 yards, at the rate of 30 feet in width of roadway. The granite cube paving in the channels and 17 crossings of roadways were relaid and repaired where necessary. The footway pavements in many parts of the Parish have been taken up, relaid, repaired, and in some cases the footways were repaved to meet the increasing wear and tear occasioned by the large number of inhabitants in the additional new streets. Roadways have been repaired and streets closed during the execution of the work, and with the aid of two steam rollers the inconvenience to the public was greatly diminished. By the 105th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the 77th Section of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, providing for the paving of new streets, much time and attention is required in obtaining payment of the estimated expenses, and in carrying out the works at the cost of owners of houses and land abutting on such streets. The various sums received by this Department and paid over to the Vestry Clerk are included in the Yearly Cash Account of the Vestry. The additional new streets taken to by the Vestry make the extent of Parish roads 44 miles 6 furlongs and 194 yards. 18 Trenches were opened by Gas and Water Companies and reinstated by the Vestry. The number is 3,971, and the cost £1,137, which has been paid to the Vestry's account. New Streets, Sewers, Buildings, and Drains. A plan, with sections, for the formation of one new street has been sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works, to be named Bravington Mews. Two thousand seven hundred and seventy-three feet run of 3ft. 9in. * 2t. 6in. sewers, one brick thick, have been constructed, including air openings for ventilation and side entrances for access to them, in the undermentioned streets, viz.:— Fordingley Road. Bravington Road (a portion). Ashmore Road (a portion). These works were carried out at the expense of private persons. Two warehouses, one dairy premises, 231 dwelling houses, and 13 stable buildings have been erected, for which the builders gave the required notices, in accordance with the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. The Orders of Vestry respecting the drainage of these buildings have been served upon the builders. 19 For future reference, copies of the Orders, attached to the notices, are kept at the Vestry Hall. Plans have been submitted with the building notices showing the proposed method of draining, by means of six and nine-inch stoneware pipes, the before-mentioned new buildings into the public sewers; the drain outlets in all instances being trapped with modern flap traps at the cost of the applicants. The total length of drain pipes laid down, as shown on the plans, is about 5 miles 2 furlongs and 140 yards. Stoppages having occurred at various times in several house drains in Maida Vale, with outlets into the small brick sewer in rear of houses there, between Clifton Road and No. 103, southward of Stranraer Place, an expense to the Vestry had arisen in removing such stoppages. A 3ft. 9in. X 2ft. Gin. brick sewer, and other works connected therewith, have been constructed by the Vestry from the sewer opposite No. 1a, Clifton Road, and thence along Maida Vale to the sewer opposite No. 105, at a cost of £1,345 11s. 10d., for the purpose of obtaining improved drainage for the owners or occupiers of such houses if required. Since the sewer has been constructed, the owners of Nos. 81 and 93, Maida Vale, have had new pipe drains laid from the sewer to their respective premises at their own expense. 20 The builder of houses now in course of erection in Clifton Road, near Maida Vale; has also had drains laid into sewer at his expense, and has paid a contribution for sewer frontage. In consequence of the dilapidated and unsatisfactory condition of ninety-eight brick and pipe drains under the public roads and footways, from various buildings, it became necessary to reconstruct them, at the cost of the applicants. A large number of works, comprising repairs to sewers, air openings, and gulleys, also the fixing of traps at the outlets of gulley and house drains, have been completed by the Vestry, at a cost of £2,012 16s. 4d. For defraying the expense of certain works required to be done for builders and other persons a sum of £1,284 5s. Id. has been received by the Vestry, and is included in the above amount. With reference to complaints received, numbering one hundred and ninety-two, relative to stoppages in house drains and gulleys, or from effluvia arising therefrom, the same have been dealt with at once, and, where practicable, the cause of complaint remedied. Examinations from sewers have been made as to stoppages in one hundred and forty-nine house 21 drains for parties requesting and paying for such examination. All drains where obstructions in them could be removed were relieved by the use of rods, but where the obstruction was caused by their defective condition, so that the stoppages could not be removed and necessitated their reconstruction, the same was carried out at the cost of the applicants. The periodical cleansing of brick sewers and removal of heavy deposits from them has been done by the Vestry's workmen. In order to still further cleanse some of the large sewers, water has been used in sufficient quantity for that purpose. The small brick and pipe sewers have also been dealt with in the same manner, with beneficial results. In addition to the cleansing of the beforementioned sewers, the workmen employed by the Vestry have removed from the sand-pits two thousand three hundred and ninety-one cubic yards of deposit, and the number of removals from the sand-pits is 31,948. This very necessary work keeps a large amount of deposit from entering the sewers, and thereby allows the water from the surface of the roads iree course thereto. The condition of all the public urinals in the 22 Parish is carefully attended to, and water freely used for cleansing and deodorizing purposes by workmen employed by the Vestry. Additional works of improvement to sewers and street gulleys have been made as follows:— The construction and reconstruction of one hundred and eleven gulley drains, and the repair of seventy others, in public streets. He-naming Streets and lie-numbering Houses. The following Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been carried out in accordance with the 87th section of the Act of 1862 :— Date of Order.

SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1881. BY JAMES STEVENSON. M.D., Medical Officer of Health. SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, The recurrence of the Census attaches an additional interest to the year 1881. The primary importance of the Census to the sanitarian is that it enables him to deal with actual facts instead of guesses at truth, or, in other words, to substitute statistics based upon reliable enumerations for those derived from mere estimates, and so to determine with accuracy the changes, whether progressive or retrogressive, in the sanitary condition of a district. The necessity of such a periodical check is apparent when one considers that an over-estimate of the population will produce an unfairly lowestimate of the birth and death rates, whilst an under-estimate will produce an exaggeration of these rates. Learning from the Census the enumerated population, and from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary the total number of births and deaths in a district, one can easily show what actually were the birth and death rates in 1881. The diminution in 28 the rate of increase in the population of Paddington, as disclosed by the Census of last year, exemplifies and emphasizes these remarks. In the accompanying table is given the enumerated population of the Parish in each of the years 1861, 1871, and 1881 :— Census. St. Mary's. St. John's. Total. 1861 39,015 30,769 75,784 1871 58,728 38,085 96,813 1881 69,888 37,330 107,218 It shows that the population increased during the decennium 1861-71 at the rate of 27.7 per cent., and during that of 1871-81 at the rate only of 10.7 per cent. If the same rate of increase had been maintained the population in 1881 would have been 123,677, instead of 107,218. Accordingly, estimates of the population for the years intervening between 1871 and 1881 from the data supplied by the period. 1861-71 are now proved to be incorrect, and, together with the statistics based upon those estimates, require to be revised. In the tables appended to this report this has been done. The variations in the population of the Parish 29 are presented in another light in the following table, which contains the rate of increase* per inhabitant per annum in each of the decennial periods 1861-71 and 1871-81, in each Sub-district of the Parish, and in the Parish as a whole:— Decennium. St. Mary's. St. John's. Paddington. 1861-71 •04174 •00352 •02479 1871-81 •01755 -.0020C03 •01026 From this table it will be seen that not merely is the rate of increase of population diminishing in the Parish as a whole, but that in St. John's Sub-district it is a negative quantity. This diminution in the rate of increase cannot be other than pleasing to the sanitarian. Occupying, as the population of Paddington does, a limited area, with definite boundaries which, on account of surrounding Parishes, do not admit of extension, a continually increasing population can only mean a continually increasing density and increasing complexity of the problems oi sanitation. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the growth in * The population of a district at two successive ccnsuses having been ascertained, the rate of increase per individual per annum for the intervening period may be determined by the use of logarithms from the formula M = P X Rn; where M=Final population, p = initial population, n = number of years (10), R, = (r + 1), and r = rate of increase per individual per annum. 30 population of Paddington will cease before it reaches a point which will jeopardize its present healthy condition. During the 52 weeks ending 31st December, 1881, 2,851 births and 1,869 deaths were registered in Paddington. Deducting the deaths of 190 nonparishioners, the corrected number of deaths in the Parish is seen to be 1,679, and the natural increase of the population from the excess of births over deaths to be 1,172, a number almost identical with that of the previous year. Births. Of the 2,851 births, comprising 1,451 male and 1,400 female children, 2,172—1,122 males and 1,050 females—were registered in St. Mary's, and 679— 329 males and 350 females—in St. John's Subdistrict. The proportion of the sexes of the children born in the Parish during the year was 100 males to 96 females, whereas in the Metropolis it was 100 males to 97 females. In St. Mary's Sub-district the proportion was 100 males to 94 females, and in St. John's 100 males to 106 females. 31 The births were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third, quarter of the year. The ratio of births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 to nearly every 38 inhabitants, or 26.6 per 1,000 persons of all ages. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to population was 1 to every 32 persons living, or 31.1 per 1,000. In St. John's the ratio of births to population was 1 to 55, or 18.2 per 1,000 inhabitants. Some of the preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table :— Sub-District. Enumerated Population.

Deaths. The total deaths registered in Paddington were, as already stated, 1,869. Of these 4 happened in 32 the Lock Hospital and 253 in St. Mary's Hospital; 3 of the deaths in the Lock Hospital and 187 of those in St. Mary's Hospital, being those of nonparishioners, are not dealt with in this Report. Of the remaining 1,679 deaths—807 males and 872 females—455 occurred in St. John's, and 1,224 in St. Mary's sub-district. The 171 deaths in the Workhouse—85 males and 86 femalesare included in the deaths in St. Mary's Subdistrict. The deaths were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third, quarter of the year. The ratio of deaths to the population, together with the death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish and in its two sub-districts, is shown in the following table : — Sub-District. Enumerated Population.

The same is true of other communities in which the term west-end has its conventional meaning. Eastward the density of population is usually greater, and the social position of the inhabitants is usually lower; the Northern and Southern Districts in the matter of the death-rate holding an intermediate position. Eastward, accordingly, the mysteries of life, with its oft-times sad accompaniments and mournful accessories, give place more speedily, and, let us hope, with kaleidoscopic change to the mysteries of death. In London this difference in the local death-rates has long been recognised, and is apparently increasing. The rate of mortality per 1,000 in the Eastern 3 34 and Western groups of Metropolitan Districts during 40 years is shown in the following table of eight quinquennial periods :— Means of five years. West Districts. East Districts. 1841-45 22.9 25.3 1846-50 23.1 27.1 1851-55 23.5 25.9 1856-60 21.7 24.4 1861-65 22.9 26.4 1866-70 22.5 27.4 1871-75 21.1 25.2 1876-80 20.5 24.6 1881 19.5 24.2 Enumerated Population, 1881 669,633 692,738 The question occurs, what are the constants which have produced this result, and which find expression in this augmentation of sickness and death. They are comprised in the one word—poverty, with its attendant ills, want of cleanliness, and over.crowding in badly-ventilated homes in narrow and dirty streets. In a wealthy district there may be isolated cases of over-crowding caused by high rents, there being insufficient house accommodation for the poor, who are hourly required to wait upon its wants; but, as a rule, the poor congregate together in the eastern parts of all large cities, where, from their own class 35 or others similarly conditioned, they meet with a readier sympathy, and, amidst little to excite their envy, find it easier to retire and die. The remedy for much of the poverty—the parent of so much disease, not to speak of crime, and of the many ills referred to—would be found in emigration, which, whilst benefiting both those who leave the country and those who remain, would at the same time lighten the burden of the social and moral reformer, who is too exclusively looking to education, temperance, and self-control, for the improvement of the masses of the people. Education is an invaluable acquisition, illumining and smoothing the path of its possessor, whilst temperance and self-control are virtues which yield their own reward; but for the majority of mankind they cannot supersede the necessity of labour which is its ordained lot, and is the urgent want of so many hands at home and of so many lands abroad. It will be observed that the same low death-rate obtained in the Parish in 1881 as in the previous year. Notwithstanding the prevalence of smallpox the Registrar-General remarks that "only once (1850) since civil registration began had a lower death-rate been recorded in the Metropolis." In calculating the rate no account is taken of the deaths, unknown to me, of parishioners in the 36 hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and in other hospitals or places outside the Parish. But such deaths are necessarily few, seeing that there is in the Parish a large general hospital in good repute, thus rendering it unnecessary for parishioners to seek extra-parochial medical relief. Moreover, the deaths, in the parish of persons who were not parishioners but merely temporary sojourners in it may be considered as counterbalancing to some extent such deaths. Bearing in mind the yearly increase of population (not less than 1,000 a year), the subjoined figures, showing the corrected number of deaths from all causes in Paddington during each of the last five years, will probably be more intelligible to some than if expressed in the form of a death-rate :— Year Corrected Number of Deaths. 1877 1,706 1878 1,761 1879 1,939 1880 1,667 1881 1,679 During the year there were 382 deaths of infants under one year, and 582 of children under five years of age, representing respectively 22.8 and 34.7 per cent. of the total deaths in the Parish. The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 37 134 deaths to every 1,000 registered births. In London the rate was 148, and in the 19 largest provincial towns it averaged 156 per 1,000 registered births, ranging from 119 in Portsmouth to 202 in Leicester, the variation being mainly determined by the death-rate from diarrhoea. Zymotic Diseases. The sanitary condition of an ordinary population is shown by its freedom from zymotic diseases, and more especially from those known as the seven principal preventible diseases, viz, small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, fever (including typhus, typhoid, and simple continued fever), and diarrhoea. Notwithstanding that the death-rate from diphtheria, measles, and small-pox exceeded their respective averages, the death-rate in London from these seven chief diseases was below the average of previous years, being 3.64 per 1,000 of the population, and 17.2 per cent. of the total deaths. In Paddington the rate was only 1.9 per 1,000 inhabitants, and 12.3 per cent. of the total deaths. Whilst these figures represent all the deaths from those diseases which actually occurred in the Parish, no cognizance is taken of the cases which were removed to hospitals beyond its limits. Small-pox. " The most notable feature," says the 38 General, "in the zymotic mortality of the year was the high death-rate from small-pox. The deaths from this disease in London were 2,371, giving a rate of 0.62 per 1,000. Only on seven occasions had this rate been exceeded in the previous 43 years, and the prevalence of this disease was the more remarkable, inasmuch as neither the rest of England and Wales, nor any one of the other large towns, was similarly affected; moreover, the same unhappy pre-eminence in regard to small-pox had been displayed by the metropolis for several preceding years." Various opinions have been expressed as to the cause of the recent greater prevalence of small-pox in London than in the other large towns. Dr. Cameron, M.P., has attributed it to the deterioration of the lymph in use, and Dr. W. B. Carpenter to the exceptional malignity of the epidemic, it being such as to beat down the defences of vaccination. From what I have heard and read, I am inclined to believe that the lymph may in some instances have been at fault, but that more frequently the operation of vaccination has been inefficiently and insufficiently performed. In Paddington there were only 7 deaths, 6 of which occurred during the second quarter of the year. During the year 123 cases were removed by the Inspectors to the hospitals—91 from St. Mary's 39 Sub-district, and 32 from St. John's; 18 being sent to Highgate, 8 to Stockwell, 23 to Deptford, 54 to Fulham, and 20 to the Paddington Workhouse Infirmary. Two of the inmates in the Workhouse also suffered from the disease. One case from St. Mary's Sub-district was sent without the knowledge of the Inspectors to Middlesex Hospital. As I have previously stated, the endeavour of the Inspectors is on all occasions to get every case of small-pox or scarlet fever removed with as little delay as possible to one or other of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or to the Small-pox and Vaccination Hospital at Highgate, or to the London Fever Hospital. Measles. Measles caused in London 2,553 deaths, giving a rate of 0.66 per 1,000; the average in the previous ten years having been 0.51. In Paddington there were 20 deaths, all of which occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district, giving a death-rate of 0.19 per 1,000 inhabitants :18 were of children under 5 years of age. The greater mortality of the previous year is perhaps the explanation of the diminished mortality in 1881. Scarlet Fever. Scarlet fever caused in London 2,108 deaths, giving a rate of 0.55 per 1,000 persons living, the 40 average of the previous ten years having been 0.60. In Paddington there were 23 deaths, a lower number than in any one of the last seven years, giving a rate of 0.21 per 1,000. Four cases were removed to the London Fever Hospital, and 40 to Stockwell. Several cases were treated at their own homes, of which no intimation was made to the Sanitary Department until its services were sought for purposes of disinfection. Diphtheria. Diphtheria caused in London 654 deaths, giving a rate of 0.17 per 1,000 persons living, against an average rate of 0.12 in the preceding decenniurn. In Paddington the 14 deaths give a rate of 013 per 1,000. This is considered one of the "filth" diseases, and, seeing that it is of a contagious character, and that the means for preventing the spread of contagion are so often neglected, it is a matter of surprise that its ravages are not greater. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough caused in London 1,961 deaths, giving a rate of 0.51 per 1,000. There would have been 3,144 deaths had the mortality been at the average rate of the preceding ten years. In 1 addington there were 53 deaths, giving a rate of 0.49 per 1,000 inhabitants, and these were almost 41 exclusively confined to the children of the working classes. Fever. Fever, including typhus, typhoid, and simple continued fever, caused in London 1,196 deaths, whereas the number according to the average rate of the previous ten years would have been 1,413. The saving was entirely under the headings "typhus" and "simple continued fever," the registered mortality from typhoid fever having been above the average. In Paddington there was 1 death from typhus fever, 21 from typhoid, and 1 from simple continued fever. Typhus Fever.—The death from typhus was that of a child in Cirencester Street. The house was very clean, and in a fair sanitary condition, there being no evidence of overcrowding. Five cases of typhus were removed to the hospitals—1 from Westbourne Terrace to the London Fever Hospital, and 4 cases (1 from North Wharf Road, 1 from Netley Street, and 2 from St. Mary's Hospital) to Stockwell. In the Netley Street case there was no room for doubt that the disease was contracted in Marylebone, and as regards the Westbourne Terrace case the evidence suggested that it was contracted outside the parish. Typhoid fever was more than usually destructive in 1881. As stated in my quarterly report, from 42 some unexplained cause it prevailed during the fourth quarter of the year to an unusual extent in the metropolis—the deaths during each week exceeding the corrected average number in the corresponding weeks of the last ten years. Not so in England and Wales, as a whole, where the deaths ascribed to fever, using the generic term, showed a rate below the mean of the ten preceding corresponding quarters. Of the 21 deaths, 9 occurred in St. Mary's, and 12 in St. John's Sub-district. Seven cases were removed from St. Mary's Sub-district— 6 being sent to Stockwell, and 1 to St. Mary's Hospital. All the cases which came to the knowledge of the Sanitary Department were specially investigated, with the view of tracing, if possible, the cause of the disease. In some instances sanitary defects, allowing of the escape of sewer air into the premises of the respective occupants, were discovered; in other cases no cause was apparent, and in the remaining cases the disease was contracted outside the parish. Diarrhoea. Owing to the low temperature and abundant rain (all during the summer months, the death-rate in London from diarrhoea was below the average, being 0.80, as compared with a previous decennial average 43 of 0.93. In Paddington the rate was 0.62 per 1,000 inhabitants. Of the 66 deaths, 51 occurred during the third, or summer quarter of the year, 51 being of infants under one year of age, and 57 of children under five years. Water. The average daily quantity of water supplied as usual by eight Companies to the inner circle of London was 149,190,193 gallons, being an increase of nearly seven millions of gallons upon the previous year. This was an average daily allowance of 32.8 gallons per head of the population, and, although somewhat less than in the previous year, it was still much in excess of what is required, and indicates great waste upon the part of the consumers. Of the above enormous quantity 74,311,816 gallons were at times largely polluted with organic matters; 65,999,067 gallons were occasionally so polluted, but to a less degree; whilst only 8,879,310 gallons were of uniformly good quality for dietetic purposes. The temperature of the Thames water supplied by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand Junction, and Lambeth Companies varied from 38.8° Fahr. in January to 68° Fahr. in July. The temperature of the Lea water delivered by the New River and East London Companies ranged from 37.40 Fahr. in January to 66.2° Fahr. in July. 44 These objectionable extremes rendered both waters unpleasantly cold in winter and unpalatably warm in summer. The deep well water supplied by the Kent Company varied only from 50° Fahr. in January to 57.9° Fahr. in July and September. The Colne Valley Company's water remained practically constant throughout the year at 52° Fahr. Much of the solid matters dissolved in the waters is composed of various substances which are harmless when the water is used for drinking purposes, but are objectionable when it is used for washing, on account of the water 'being thereby rendered hard. All the water supplied to the Metropolis would be improved if it were submitted to Clark's process, which consists in the addition to it of slaked lime, thus precipitating the carbonate of lime, the presence of which in solution in the water mainly causes the hardness. The average quality of the water drawn from the Ihamesand the Lea during the greater part of the year was much better than usual, as the Companies subjected it to more efficient filtration, and have at their command improved means of storage ; nevertheless, in January, February, March, and December, the water distributed by most of the Companies from these sources was much polluted with organic matter, and not fit to drink. Generally, the Lea water was 45 considerably less polluted than that derived from the Thames, the New River Company's supply being, as a rule, of superior quality to any of the Thames waters. The organic matters polluting the Thames and Lea are, to a great extent, of animal origin. The best average supplies from the Thames were delivered by the Chelsea and the Grand Junction Companies, and the worst by the Southwark Company. Dr. Frankland repeats his emphatic commendation of the deep well waters, the best being that supplied by the Colne Valley Company. The natural filtration which the deep well water undergoes in percolating through great thicknesses of porous strata renders artificial filtration unnecessary. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies,which draw their supplies from the Thames, as do the Chelsea, the Lambeth, and the Southwark Companies. For many of the preceding remarks, as well as for the annexed tables showing the condition of the London waters, I am indebted to Dr. Frankland's Annual Report to the Registrar-General. It is due to the Companies to say that another picture of the quality of the London waters is 46 sented by the examiners employed by them, Messrs. Crookes, Odling, and Tidy. These gentlemen have collected and published, in a report addressed to the President of the Local Government Board, the results of their daily examinations of samples of the water delivered during the year 1881 by the seven companies drawing their supplies from the Thames and the Lea. They say,— "That taking the organic carbon as a trustworthy index of the organic matter contained in the water, the amount of organic matter present in the water supplied to London is, as a rule—contrary to popular, but not to scientific opinion—exceedingly small, never exceeding the 1/1000 of a per cent. "That the water supplied to the Metropolis is, as a rule, efficiently filtered, and that the suspended matter is almost entirely of the nature of clay and sand, and on the worst days when the water was recorded as turbid, averaged considerably less than one grain per gallon. "That the waters of the Thames and Lea are well aerated, and contain in solution very nearly the full quantity of free oxygen that it is possible for water to dissolve: a fact of great importance as an evidence of the absence of decomposing organic matter, in other words, of the absence either of putrescent or of putrescible matter. 47 "That the mineral matter which gives to water its 'hardness,' held in solution in the waters, consists mainly of the carbonates of the alkaline earths, with a small quantity of sulphates, nitrates, and chlorides. No one suggests that these salts are detrimental to health, and it is contended that they are actually useful to the animal economy as one means of supplying constituents required for the organism." After giving several extracts from the report of the Royal Commission on Water Supply, 1869, and furnishing statistics, to show that the death-rate in towns (omitting London) supplied with river water compares favourably with that of towns supplied by deep well or spring water, and that judged by the rate of mortality in the Metropolis where there are districts supplied with deep well water and districts supplied with river water, any slight difference is in favour of the latter, they conclude with the expression of their opinion that "the filtered water of the Thames and the Lea is unimpeachable in respect of its wholesomeness and suitability for town supply." I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, September, 1882. 48 TABLE A.

TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON. Public Lighting Department June 17th, 1882. Gentlemen, I have to submit the Eight Annual Report, ending Lady-day. 1882, as to the working of this department. During the year the following damages have been done to the public lamps, either through carelessness or accidents, viz.:—22 lamp posts knocked down, 42 lamp columns broken, 41 head-irons and 42 lanterns damaged. The repairs attending this work have been executed by the Vestry's own staff. In 29 cases the parties liable for such damage have been discovered, and the expenses attending the restoration have been paid by them; where necessary summonses have been issued to enforce payment. In 21 cases the parties have escaped. 60 During the year 17 large refuge lamps have been erected in some of the principal thoroughfares in the Parish. Tablets have been placed in the lamps stationed at the corners of the streets throughout the Parish, with the names of the streets and roads in illuminated letters. The lamp services generally throughout the Parish are maintained by the Gas Company in an efficient manner. 128 notices have been sent to them during the year for the rectification of stoppages, &c. The annexed table shows the reported number of defects in the Metered and Scale Lamps during the twelve months. The Average Meter System still continues to give every satisfaction. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WESTON, Inspector of Public Lighting for the Parish of Paddington. METERED LAMPS. Quarter ending, Knocked down and out of Lighting.

TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON. Works Department, June 17th, 1882. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the annual report relative to the works of Dusting, Slopping, Watering, Carting Road Materials, Smith's Work, and General Repairs in connection with this Department; also the Sweeping of the Public Highways for the year ending Lady-day, 1882. Dusting.— During the year 3,659 horses have been engaged in dusting—the number of loads collected being 18,388, which is an excess of 1,626 loads over that brought in six years since, when the Vestry first commenced doing its own work. This increase, in a great measure, has been due to the rapid development of the Parish in the St. Peter's Park district. The daily average number of loads was 60.9 60 per working day, or 5.02 loads per horse per day. From the quantity collected in the rough, 36 tons of coals, 774 loads of hard core, 1,757½ tons of soft core, 49 tons 8 cwt. of bones, 52 tons of rags, 43 tons 13 cwt. of old iron, 3 tons 7 cwt. 1 qr. and 21 lbs. of various metals, 14 tons of white glass, and 55 tons of black glass have been abstracted. The number of chaldrons of ashes and breeze sold from off the wharves and the depot at Alperton has been 18,968 chaldrons of ashes and 10,326 chaldrons of breeze; from this quantity 10,754 chaldrons of ashes and 5,842 chaldrons of breeze have been sent away in 536 boats. 8,214 chaldrons of ashes and 4,485 chaldrons of breeze have been taken away by carts. Owing to the ready sales of ashes and breeze, it has not been necessary to deposit any on the field at Alperton; at the same time, had the Vestry been without this convenient outlet, there is not the slightest doubt much trouble and additional expense would have been incurred in getting rid of the materials from off the wharves. Slopping.—In consequence of several of the old macadam roads being now paved with wood, the amount of slop and scrapings collected therefrom has been considerably reduced. During the year 2l,9S5 loads were collected, being a diminution of 5,921 loads over the previous year, the maximum 67 number collected in one week being 977, and the minimum 189, giving a daily average of 71.37 loads. The whole of this work has been executed by 5,040 horses and carts, giving a daily average of 16.36 horses, or at the rate of 4.36 loads per horse per day. By the canal 20,554½ tons of slop and sweepings have been sent away in 595 boats, and 1,431 loads have been deposited at open shoots. Watering.—During the season the water vans were out 142 days, 3,775 horses being employed, giving an average of 26.58 horses and vans per day. Carting Eoadway Materials.—Including wood paving works, 3,914 horses and carts have been engaged 310 days, giving an average of 12.62 per day. Horses.—The present number of horses is 69, they are all in excellent health and condition, with the exception of one which is now recovering from strangles. During the twelve months the losses by deaths have only been two, viz.:— On May 17th, 1881, a bay mare, No. 14, was killed, being incurably affected with Tetanus. 68 On January 19th, 1882, a brown gelding, No. 16, from ruptured bowels. This horse had also a very bad open sand crack. Towards the close of the watering season six old horses, not worth wintering, were sold by public auction at Barbican. They realised an average of £15 2s. 9d. each. Fodder.—The contracts entered into during the year for the supply of Fodder have been as follow, from which it will be seen that the average cost per horse for keep and bedding has been 20s. 0.47d. per week:— One Week's supply per Horse.

Harness.—All the repairs to the harness, the making of new sets, as required from time to time, have been executed by workmen in the employ of the Vestry. Smith and Farrier's Work.—The Highway Department have had during the year 741 pickaxes lined and steeled; 15,769 pickaxes, 266 chisels, and 17 paving hammers sharpened, and several miscellaneous repairing works in connection with the steam roadrollers and tools. The whole of the horse shoes, shoeing, repairs of machinery, and general smith's work in connection with the Works Department, have been executed at the Vestry's Depot. Road Sweeping.—The scavengers under the control of this department continue to work satisfactorily. General Observations.—The Vestry will be glad to hear that the cost of carrying out the several works herein mentioned has been ,£1,227.19s. 5½d. less than last year. 71 The statements A, B, C, and D, accompanying this report, will furnish interesting details and information in connection with the working of this department during the past year.

The 654 births, comprising 328 male and 326 female children, show an annual birth rate of 22.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish. Deducting from the total deaths (462) the deaths of 47 non-parishioners in the two hospitals 2 in the parish, the corrected number of deaths is seen to be 415—198 males and 217 females,—and the annual death rate to be 14.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. In calculating the death rate no account is taken of the deaths of parishioners in places outside the parish; or, on the other hand, of the deaths of non-parishioners in the parish, with the exception of those who died in the two hospitals. The recorded natural increase of population from the excess of births over deaths was 239. The number of births and of deaths, and the birth and death rates in the two Sub-districts of the parish are shown in the subjoined Table. TABLE II. Sub-districts. Estimated Population. Births.

The year 1877, it will be remembered, was exceptionally healthy. In the public institutions in the parish there were 91 deaths; viz., 31 in the Workhouse, 59 in St. Mary's Hospital, and 1 in the Lock Hospital. The 31 deaths in the Workhouse—15 males and 16 females—being regarded as those of parishioners, are included in the 308 deaths registered in St. Mary's sub-district. Of the 59 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital 46 were those of non-parishioners, as was also the 1 death in the Lock Hospital, and these are therefore not dealt with in this report.

The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 151 deaths to 1,000 registered births. In London it did not exceed 141, whereas it averaged 163 in the nineteen largest provincial towns, ranging from 132 in Portsmouth to 199 in Salford. The infantile death rate was 55 in Colchester, and 241 in Ash ton. under-Lvne. The deaths of children under 5 years of age constituted 36 per cent. of the total deaths, and were mostly due to diseases of the zymotic, local, and developmental classes. 4 TABLE IV.

In calculating this rate no cognisance is taken of the cases of infectious diseases which were removed to hospitals beyond the boundaries of the parish. Scarlet Fever.—Whilst the increased mortality from this disease was mainly due to its appearance in an epidemic form as announced in my last quarterly report, it is to be borne in mind that deaths from Scarlet Fever are usually most numerous during the fourth quarter of the year. There were 19 deaths in the parish. 22 cases were removed to Stockwell. Whooping Cough.—Of the zymoses, next to Scarlet Fever in point of fatality was Whooping Cough, which occasioned 13 deaths, all of which occurred in St. Mary's sub-district, and were of children of poor parents. 5 TABLE V., showing the localities in which deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases occurred during the fourth quarter of the year 1880.

The condition of the Canal Basin has engaged much of the attention of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee. The following are extracts from my fortnightly reports:— "4th November, 1880.—I beg to report that the Canal Basin was "emptied on the 31st ult., before 8 a.m. The shoals of mud then "presented to view bore out the representations made by me in former "reports as to the varying depths and the quantity of the deposit. Judg"ing from the preparations made by the engineer of the Company for its "removal, it must greatly have exceeded his expectations. On Monday "I visited every wharf on the north side of the Basin between Howley "Place Bridge and Praed Street, and was surprised to see so few men at "work. In reply to my inquiries I was told that in several instances 'c the Company had undertaken to remove at the cost of the tenants the " mud in front of their wharves, thus explaining the inaction on the part 11 of the tenants themselves. On Tuesday I again visited most of the " wharves, and several of them yesterday. Some of the wharfingers " have removed the mud and reached the bottom of the Basin. Others " have done nothing, notably that of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's " Works, G, Irongate Wharf. The mode adopted by the Company for " removing the mud is certainly not the speediest, nor, in my opinion, " the most effectual they could have employed. The Basin must be " again flooded to allow of the removal of the barges, beneath which " there is a deposit varying in depth from eighteen inches to two feet. " The work is being done in a half-hearted manner—not sufficient " strength being employed. When I visited the Basin yesterday after. " noon, it appeared to me that not one-sixth of the deposit had been " removed. I am told that the water was let into the Basin between " .10.30 last night and 8.30 this morning." " 6th January, 1881.—I have to report that the Canal Basin " was again emptied on the 25th and refilled on the 30th December, " 1880. I visited it on the 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st. The " deposit immediately in front of the Parish Stone Wharf was re" moved, also a portion of that immediately in front of No. 25 Wharf, " Bridge Terrace, Harrow Road. The shoals of mud elsewhere " exposed to view in that part of the Basin between Bishop's Road " Bridge and the bridge opposite Howley Place were not disturbed. 7 "From that part of the Basin between Bishop's Road Bridge and "South Wharf Road, several barge loads of the deposit were removed, "but much was left behind. I am of opinion that the work has "been very imperfectly done. Neither on this nor on the former "occasion of emptying the Basin has a sufficient number of men "been employed. I feel confident that, with the return of hot "weather, the nuisance will recur, even should no further addition "be made to the deposit left in the Basin, notwithstanding the "assertion of the Company that the Basin has been thoroughly "cleansed." Meteorology. In his report to the Registrar-General Mr. James Glaisher, F. R.S., remarks that the mean reading of the barometer during the quarter corresponded with the average in 39 years ; that it was above the average in November and below it in October and December. In October the weather was cold and wet, colder in fact than in any October since 1842, and at most places the wettest on record. On the 20th snow fell all over the country, more particularly in the south of England. In November the weather was very variable, the first and third weeks having been cold, the second and last warm. At Greenwich rain fell daily from the 8th to the 26th of the month. In December the weather was exceptionally mild, the first half being dry, whilst from the 16th to the end of the month the rain was almost continuous. In London the rainfall during the quarter was 12.8 inches, exceeding by 5.7 inches the average amount in the corresponding periods of the previous 65 years. Vestry Hall, Paddington, February, 1881.
