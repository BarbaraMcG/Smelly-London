To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1950. The year under review was, on the whole, a satisfactory one from the point of view of health in that the incidence of infectious disease was low, with the exception of pulmonary tuberculosis, 54 new cases of which were notified during the year, compared with 46 in 1949. There can be little doubt that cases of this kind are preventable by improvements in housing, by isolation of chronic cases and the extension of immunisation, by means of B.C.G. vaccine to children and others specially exposed to the risk of infection. Much is being done but much more will have to be done before this scourge is reduced to the level of impotence of other infectious diseases which were once a serious menance and have now, largely, disappeared from our midst. During the year the Housing Committee assisted ten tuberculous families in regard to rehousing; a mass radiography survey was carried out in the district and, recently, a Tuberculosis After-Care Committee for Crayford has been brought into being. No case of diphtheria occurred in Crayford during 1953 and, in fact, only two cases of this disease have: occurred in the District since 1942. The Clean Food Campaign which the Council are carrying out in conjunction with the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith continued to make progress during the year, and Codes of Practice were formulated for the majority of food trades. A successful Clean Food Exhibition was planned in the latter part of the year and was held in May, 1951. This Campaign represents a long term effort in Health Education and, although this work tends to be; slow and unspectacular, it is well worth pursuing and will, it is hoped, result, in the future, in improved standards of food hygiene in the area. Incidently, no case of food poisoning was notified in 1950 compared with 5 cases in 1949. 3 The Birth Rate was 15.6 per 1,000 of the population compared with 17.9 in 1949 the rate for England and Wales for 1950 being 15.8. The Death Rate fell from 8.03 in 1949 to 7.89 i'n 1950 which compares favourably with a rate of 11.6 for the Country as a whole. The Registrar-General has supplied comparability factors for 1950. The standardised Birth Rate which allows for comparison with other parts of the Country is 14.5 and the standardised Death Rate is 9.5. There were no deaths due to childbirth and a Maternal Mortality Rate of nil reflects credit on the ante-natal and obstetric services within the district. The Infant Mortality Rate for 1950 was 27.6 per l,000 live births and, although the rate was higher than the 26.4 per 1,000 recorded in 1949, the number of infantile deaths was actually one less in 1950 than in 1949. The higher rate was, therefore, due to the smaller number of births (443 in 1950, 500 in 1949). The rate for the Country as a whole was. 29.8 and, excellent as these results are, there is still room for improvement. The welfare of old people received much prominence during 1950. On receipt of the Ministry of Health Circular 11/50, a townspeople's meeting was called by the Chairman of the Urban District as a result of which a Good Neighbours Association was formed for the purpose of befriending old people living in loneliness and a devoted team of voluntary workers has done much good work' during the year. In conclusion, I wish to express my sincere thank's to the members of the Health Committee for their support during the year and to the Senior Sanitary Inspector, the Chief Clerk, and all members of the Staff of the Health Department for their industry and loyal co-operation during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

Since the 5th July, 1948, these Services have bean administered by the Kent County Council. CHILD WELFARE CLINIC FACILITIES. The Council made representation to the Kent County Council regarding the lack of adequate facilities fo;r the accommodation and operation of the various Welfare Clinics held at Slade Green and Barnehurst, and urged the Kent County Council to give consideration to the inclusion of a Child Welfare Clinic in the proposed Community Centre at Slade Green. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year the question of mortuary facilities came under review. The facilities were not in all respects found suitable, and the Council agreed to participate with the Bexley and Erith Borough Councils for the joint use of the Bexleyheath Mortuary, which was to be upgraded to a full modern standard of amenities including refrigeration. LABORATORY FACILITIES. The following specimens were sent to the County Laboratory from the District during 1950:— Swabs. Diphtheria 1 Haemolytic Streptococci — Sputum. Tuberculosis Officers 98 Private Practitioners 6 Others 545 Waters. Public Supplies (Wells) 25 Swimming Bath 23 Ice Creams 55 Milk.

The Council, in conjunction with the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith, organised a public lecture which was given by the Medical Officer of Health on "Population," at the Town Hall, Crayford. The subject, which proved popular, brought forth a very interesting discussion. PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND OTHER DISEASES. Scarlet Fever.

Special consideration is given to cases put forward by the Medical Officer of Health involving tuberculosis or other physical disability in the applicants' families and such cases are considered outside the normal points scheme. Cases investigated during the year—62. Applicants recommended for rehousing—13. No . of families granted houses on account of Tuberculosis—10. MASS RADIOGRAPHY. A short Mass Radiography Survey was held in Crayford from the 4th to 9th July, 1950. The shoot period was partly due to the fact that many Crayford residents had already availed themslelves of the facilities when the Unit had been operating in an adjacent area. 19 PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Council's scheme for the joint use of the Borough of Bexley's Cleansing Station has worked satisfactorily. Facilities were available for the disinfection of bedding following cases of infectious diseases, Tuberculosis and Cancer and for the disinfestation of bedding of verminous persons. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE. In accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular No. 11/50 which asks Local Authorities to consider suggestions for collaboration between themselves and local voluntary organisations in promoting the welfare of old people, a Committee was appointed with representatives of the Urban District Council and voluntary organisations in the district under the title of the Crayford Good Neighbours Association, and a panel of visitors willing to visit old people in their own homes was. formed. The service provides the changing of books for those unable to visit the public libraries, assisting with shopping, letter writing, mending and other good neighbourly actions. Home visiting of this kind has proved of particular value in mitigating the sense of loneliness often experienced by these old people and many have expressed their appreciation of the attention given to them. A Council bungalow with special concessions was made available in Russell Close, Crayford, to a retired' nurse who had undertaken to give attention to old people living in Council bungalows in the Close. In addition there are two Darby and Joan Clubs functioning under the Women's Voluntary Service which meet weekly for the Crayford and Barnehurst areas at the Manor House Community Centre, and for the Slade Green area at the Baptist Chapel, Elm Road, Slade Green. There is also an Old Age Pensioners' Club which meets weekly at the Co-operative Hall, Crayford. Domestic Help. The Kent County Council provided a Domestic Help Scheme which rendered invaluable service to old people. In 1950 this service was granted to 70 families 20 in Crayford who were beteen 70 and 90 years of age; of these 63 had the service free of cost. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. Food. Complaint was received regarding a piece of solder in a loaf of bread. A strong letter of warning was sent to the manufacturer concerned. Milk. Complaint was receiveed regarding a splinter of glass alleged to have been found in a bottle of milk. A strong letter of warning was forwarded to the dairy concerned. Meat.

CLEAN FOOD CAMPAIGN. In my report for 1949 I referred to the Clean Food Campaign being organised in conjunction with the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith. The scheme is progressing and Codes of Practice are in preparation for the various Food Traders. Preparations are also in progress for a Clean Food Exhibition to be held in 1951. 23 A Lecture given by the Medical Officer of Health on Clean Food and a film show proved an interesting item of the Campaign.

Water. The Metropolitan Water Board is the supplying authority. The supply to the Crayford District is a mixture of water from Crayford, Dartford, Darenth, Wansunt and Wilmington wells. All the water was chlorinated on the works, but any chlorine remaining after a period of contact was removed completely. Bacteriological analyses were made five times per week for all supplies both before and after chlprinatio and 100 per cent. first class results were obtained during the year. All new and repaired mains were chlorinated before being restored to use and samples of water from them' were tested bacteriologically. There was a serious pollution of the Crayford Well at the beginning of April, 1950, with the result that the station was out of service until the end of ajnuary, 1951. Although there was gross sewage contamination of the well it was taken out of supply immediately on the first signs of deterioration in bacterial quality, and no contaminated water passed into supply. Water Sampling. (a) Wells (drinking water) Bacteriological 8. (b) New Pipe Supply, Bacteriological 1. (c) Swimming Tool, Bacteriological 23. (d) Artesian Well, Bacteriological 1. (e) Domestic Supplies, Bacteriological 13. (f) River Water (Industrial use only), Bacteriological 2. 25 One house previously supplied by a well was connected to the mains supply and the well consequently no longer used for domestic purposes. In my report for 1949, I referred to the high bacterial count reported by the Analyst on samples of water taken from the swimming pool, following whlich a Break Point Chlorinator Plalit was installed. Since the installation reports on water samples have repeatedly been highly satisfactory. Drainage and Sewerage. 925 ft. of 9 in.
