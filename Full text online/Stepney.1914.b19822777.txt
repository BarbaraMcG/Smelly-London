STE 15 ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1914. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST FOR THE YEAR 1914. To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you my fourteenth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1914. Population. The resident population of the Borough of Stepney estimated to the middle of the year was 273,265, distributed as follows:— Limehouse District 52,238 St. George-in-the-East 46,345 Mile End Old Town 110,452 Whitechapel District 64,230 273,265 Towards the end of the year, the empty houses were very few in number. The population is therefore to that extent under-estimated and the actual birth-rate and death-rate are really lower than recorded in this Report. The further we are removed in time from the preceding census, the more inexact our estimated population becomes, and the less reliable are all vital statistics. For statistical and comparative purposes, it is almost impossible to depart from the method adopted by the Registrar-General in order to arrive at an estimate of the population. This method is based on the assumption that the rate of increase, or decrease, which prevailed in the last completed intercensal period, has been similar since the census was made. The results obtained by this method are not correct. In 1891, the census population was 284.931, and in 1901_it_was 298,600. There was 2 an intercensal increase of 1.3,069. For the years 1901 to 1911, the population was estimated as if it would increase in the same ratio. The census of 1911 demonstrated that there had been a decrease, and the population for the intercensal years had been over-estimated. The mortality figures were therefore too low. Between 1891 and 1901 small houses were demolished and large model dwellings were erected on the sites. This transformation did not continue after 1901. In 1901, there were very few unoccupied houses in the Borough, over-crowding was prevalent, and it was most difficult to abate it, due to the dearth of empty houses. In 1904, the number of empty houses became abnormal, and the number increased until 1908, as is seen by the following figures which the Borough Treasurer has supplied me with :— In the quarter ended March 31st, 1904, the number of empty houses was 1,073. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1906, the number of empty houses was 1,670. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1907, the number of empty houses was 2,865. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1908, the number of empty houses was 2,944. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1909, the number of empty houses was 2,729. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1910, the number of empty houses was 2,529. In the quarter ended March 31st. 1911, the number of empty houses was 2,408. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1912, the number of empty houses was.1,847. . In the quarter ended March 31st, 1913, the number of empty houses was 1,770. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1914, the number of empty houses was 1,434. The population is estimated for each year following 1911 as if it had decreased in the same ratio as it had in the period 1891 to 1911. In 1914 there were nearly a thousand empty houses less than in 1911. Allowing 7.7 persons to each house, the population has probably increased by 7,500 instead of diminishing by over 6,500. The actual death and mortality rates are therefore, for that reason, better than recorded in this report. This method of estimating the population, however, has advantages over others which are sometimes employed. One method is based upon the extent of the excess of the number of births over the number of deaths in any particular year. The excess of births over deaths is known as the " natural increase " in the population, but the accuracy of this method obviously rests upon the absence of any marked difference between the immigration and emigration associated with the district concerned. In the Borough of Stepney, emigration and immigration profoundly affect the population, and any estimate based upon the natural increase of the population would be almost worthless. It will be thus understood that, after a certain period since the census was taken, all methods of estimating the population are liable to error. 3 Births. The total number of births registered during the year was 7,983, or 182 less than in the previous year. They consisted of 4,123 males and 3,860 females. 1,761 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 33.7 per 1,000 of the population. 1,491 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 32.1 per 1,000 of the population. 3,207 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 29.0 per 1,000 of the population. 1,524 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 23.7 per 1,000 of the population.

This corresponds to a rate of 12.1 per 1,000 of the population. 2,893 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. This large increase is to a great extent accounted for by the epidemic of Scarlet Fever which occurred during the year. 493 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 9.4 per 1,000. 502 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 10.8 per 1,000. 1,266 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 11.4 per 1,000. 1,155 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 17.9 per 1,000. There were in addition, 3,199 notification certificates received referring to Tuberculosis, 1,532 of whom were notified for the first time. Excluding Tuberculosis, the greatest number of notifiable diseases occurred during the third week in October, when 140 were notified. During this week, the largest number of notifications of Scarlet Fever was received, viz., 98. The maximum number of notifications of Diphtheria was received during the fourth week in November, when 40 notifications were received. The largest number of notifications of Enteric Fever was received in the third week in December when 6 notifications were received. The maximum number of notifiable diseases occurred during the fourth week of September, and last week of December in the Limehouse District, the second week of October in St. George's, the third week of November in Mile End, and the first and third weeks of October in the Whitechapel District. Wrong Diagnosis. 99 cases of Infectious Disease were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which were subsequently returned home in consequence of the patients being found not to be suffering from the diseases stated on the certificates, or any other notifiable diseases. 53 of the cases were notified by private practitioners, 32 from the London Hospital, and 14 from other public institutions. This number referred to 59 cases of Scarlet Fever, 37 of Diphtheria, and 3 of Enteric Fever. Bacteriological Examinations. 943 specimens were bacteriologically examined, with the following results:— No. Positive. No. Negative. Total. Consumption 133 476 609 Diphtheria 95 206 301 Enteric Fever 10 23 33 238 705 943 12 Small Pox. No case of Small Pox was notified during the year. Scarlet Fever. 2,009 cases were notified during the year, or 1,225 more than in the previous year. 1,971 were removed to Fever Hospitals. 253 belonged to the Limehouse District, with 3 deaths; 257 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with 5 deaths; 705 belonged to Mile End Old Town, with 7 deaths; 794 belonged to the Whitechopel District, with 10 deaths. The death rate for the whole Borough was .09 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was .07 per 1,000. Scarlet Fever was prevalent in the Borough during the latter half of the year. It seemed to be more prevalent in this Borough than in neighbouring Boroughs, and was most prevalent in the western portion of the Borough—a large proportion of the patients attending schools in the district west of Sidney Street. The outbreak was partly due to the existence of cases which had not been recognised, and also to the wilful or ignorant exposure by parents in public places of children suffering from Scarlet Fever. One flagrant case was that of a woman, who was told that the child was suffering from Scarlet Fever, and that she was to keep the child in bed until the ambulance arrived to remove him to the Fever Hospital. When the Sanitary Inspector called to inspect the premises, he was informed that the mother had taken the child to the London Hospital. The Inspector immediately went to the London Hospital, where he found the mother and child sitting in the waiting-room of the out-patient department, with a crowd of other people. On another occasion, the school teacher was about to punish a boy, by striking him on the hand with a cane, when the teacher noticed the boy's hand was 'peeling.' He sent the boy home and communicated with me. I examined the boy, and there was no doubt in my mind that the child was recovering from the effects of Scarlet Fever. I interviewed the mother, who went out to work, and she admitted that three weeks previously, the boy had a rash which she attributed to fish poisoning. He was indoors for two days, and subsequently, had been playing in the streets with other children. A woman living in East India Dock Road was taken ill and had a sore throat on a Monday. Her landlady told her that she thought she was suffering from Scarlet Fever. On the two following days, she was unable to leave her bed, but on the fourth day (Thursday) she travelled with her baby, aged 14 months, by London Brighton & South Coast Railway to Chichester, in the same compartment with Chart showing the number of cases notified week by week in the Borough, of Scarlet Fever, Typhoid Fever and Diphtheria, during 1914.

From Chichester she went to West Wittering to her mother's home, by carrier's van with other passengers. Subsequently, a boy at this place developed Scarlet Fever. On her return to East India Dock Road, I interviewed her, but she denied that she had been told she was suffering from Scarlet Fever before she left for West Wittering. She further told me that the day before she was taken ill, she had a tin of salmon for tea, and she attributed her illness to it. A girl aged 9½, living in Commercial Road, was notified to be suffering from Scarlet Fever on October 26th. There were three children in the family besides the patient. On October 27th, when the premises were visited by the Sanitary Inspector, he found that the child had been taken to the London Hospital. The Inspector immediately proceeded to the Hospital, and found the patient in charge of her aunt in the isolation room, waiting for the ambulance to remove the patient to the Fever Hospital. When asked why she had brought the child through the streets to the Hospital, and so exposed people to infection, the aunt replied, that as the ambulance had not come to remove the patient that morning, she brought her niece to the London Hospital. There is no doubt of the fact that the epidemic, being of a mild character, was to a great extent responsible for its spread. Children contracted the disease, and as they were apparently not very ill, no doctor was called to see them. No attempt at isolation was made, and therefore other cases occurred in the same family. The number of houses in which multiple cases occurred was abnormal. There was apparently no connection with the milk supply, but some schools were more affected than others, as is seen by the accompanying tables.

The death rate throughout the whole Borough was .02 per 1,000 of the population. The death rate for the whole of London was .03 per 1,000. As mentioned in my previous reports, the diminution in the incidence of Enteric Fever has been most marked during the last fourteen years, as is seen by the following figures:— In 1901 the number of cases was 245 1902 „ „ 273 1903 „ „ 179 1904 „ „ 183 1905 „ „ 117 1906 „ „ 119 1907 „ „ 107 1908 „ „ 83 1909 „ „ 63 1910 „ „ 111 1911 „ „ 79 1912 „ ,, 51 1913 „ „ 70 1914 „ „ 44 B 2 20 Erysipelas. 401 cases were notified, or 45 more than in the previous year. 62 occurred in the Limehouse District, with 3 deaths; 87 occurred in St. George-in-the-East, with 1 death; 127 occurred in Mile End Old Town, with 3 deaths; 125 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 2 deaths.

Cerebro-Spinal Fever. Cerebro-spinal Fever (known also as Epidemic Cerebro-spinal Meningitis and Spotted Fever) has recently attracted a great deal of attention, due to the fact, probably, that it has made its appearance among the Troops. It is an acute epidemic disease, characterised by great disturbance of the central nervous system, indicated at the outset chiefly by shivering, intense headache or vertigo, or both, and persistent vomiting. There is acute pain in certain muscles, especially the posterior muscles of the neck, occasioning retraction of the head. The organism which causes the disease is found in the mucous secretion of the naso-pharynx in a considerable proportion of those suffering, especially in its earlier stages. It is also found in some apparently healthy persons, who have been in contact with those suffering from the disease. Many people who thus harbour the organism (meningo-coccus) in their naso-pharynx, may either remain unaffected, or suffer only from a slight pharyngeal catarrh, but they may transmit the disease to others. This is especially likely to happen when there is intimate contact, such as occurs in the fondling of children or in kissing. Outbreaks are usually associated with overcrowding of civil or military populations. The spread of the disease is usually associated also with lack of cleanliness, and ventilation, and frequently with inclement conditions of weather. Under such circumstances, it appears likely that the resistance to infection is lowered, the opportunities for infection are increased, and that possibly the virulence of the meningococcus is greater. Four cases were notified during the year, one having occurred in the Limehouse district, two in St. George's and one in Whitechapel. All proved fatal. 21 Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 52 cases were notified during the year, or 30 more than in the previous year. 17 belonged to the Limehouse district, 6 to St. George's, 25 to Mile End, and 4 to the Whitechapel district. Poliomyelitis. 25 cases of Poliomyelitis were notified during the year, or 10 more than in the previous year; 5 belonged to the Limehouse district, 3 to St. George's, 14 to Mile End, and 3 to the Whitechapel district.

These leaflets gave instructions as to the precautions which were to be taken to prevent deaths from Summer Diarrhoea. Special visits and re-visits were made by the Health Visitors during the season to premises, in which there were infants from 3 to 12 months old, and in which breast feeding was known to have ceased. Special stress was laid on the methods to be adopted for storing milk and other food. The mothers were urged to have milk vessels thoroughly cleansed and scalded, and afterwards kept cool in water, or wrapped in a damp cloth. They were also advised to have flies destroyed by fly-traps or fly-catching papers, &c. 32 DEATHS FROM DIARRHCEA IN THE CORRESPONDING WEEKS IN 1911, 1912, 1913 & 1914, WITH THE METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.

All the cases were not notified. 189 deaths occurred in 1914, the certificates of death stating that they had died from Consumption, although they had never been notified to be suffering from the disease during their life time; 25 of these lived in common lodging houses. Of the 1,230 new cases notified during the year, 424 were insured and 804 were not insured. That is, nearly 35 per cent. of all the cases were insured. If we deduct the new cases under 15 years of age, which are, of course, all uninsured, the insured cases comprise 44 per cent. of the total.

In Whitechapel, as in previous years, the death rate per 1,000 of the population from Phthisis is greater than in the rest of the Borough, although this is not the case with regard to the general death rate. This may be due to several causes. In the first place, as I pointed out in my last Annual Report, there is a greater proportion of Jews living in this part of the Borough than in any other part, and Consumption is undoubtedly on the increase among them. There is another factor which refers to the number of persons occupying a room. In the premises where cases of Consumption occurred, the average number of persons occupying the room with the Consumptive was 199, in Whitechapel, whereas it was 1.67 in Mile End, 14.3 Limehouse and 181 in St. George's. The following table contains the number of persons notified and the number of deaths from Tuberculosis per 1,000 of the population during 1914 in certain model dwellings in different parts of the Borough, which are occupied by Jews and Non-Jews.

It is therefore advisable to work out the figures for a number of years. The notification rate and death rate are lower than in the previous year. This is also true of the rest of the Borough. Leaving Lolesworth Buildings out, as the number of Jews and Non-Jews, is fairly equally divided, the remaining Buildings, which are of a similar type, are occupied by 5,984 Jews and 3,325 Non-Jews. In the former 7.52 per 1,000 of the occupiers were notified to be suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and 1.66 per 1,000 died. In the Buildings which contained no Jews, 6'31 per 1,000 were notified to be suffering from the disease, and .9 per 1,000 died. This difference is not so marked as in the previous year.

All the patients belonged to the wage-earning classes, and their admission to the Sanatorium beds provided by the Council, depended upon their inability to pay the fees of private institutions, and upon their being certified as medically suitable. Poor-law cases were not accepted, as the Guardians made suitable arrangements for them. At first, the Council provided 6 beds for male patients at Fairlight Sanatorium, Hastings, and 4 beds for females at Maitland Sanatorium, Reading. Strangely enough, applications for treatment were comparatively few, and oftener than not, there was a vacant bed. This caused the Public Health Committee to reduce the number of beds to 4,—2 for males and 2 for females. The difficulty was due to the want of any system for providing for the support of the sick worker's family, during his residence in the Sanatorium. He was thus prevented from entering the Sanatorium at the earliest stage, while he yet felt himself capable of working, and perhaps earning full wages. It is, however, at this stage of the disease, that the best results can be looked forward to. The necessities of his family, rather than his own progress towards recovery, might often induce him to return to his work too soon. The number of persons treated in the Council's Sanatorium beds from July, 1911, to the end of 1913, was 48. The average length of stay for each patient in the Council's beds was a little over 4 months. A large number, after their return, expressed their regret that they had not made a longer stay at the Sanatorium. The results of the Sanatorium treatment are more encouraging and promising if the disease is in the earliest stages. Attention is therefore concentrated on the early diagnosis of the disease. The early consumptive does not discover himself, but must be actively sought out. In order to give some idea of the permanent value of Sanatorium treatment, I beg to give the after history of patients who occupied the Council's beds in Sanatorium in 1911-1913. Of the 48 patients admitted to the Council's beds, 27 have moved from the premises where they lived previous to their going to the Sanatorium, but I have been able to trace the addresses of 18 of these. As far as I can ascertain, the patients kept under observation, live under similar conditions as far as their occupations are concerned, whether they return to their previous addresses or not, and they have nearly all returned to their former occupations. It is a pity that 41 some form of occupation could not be provided for them, which does not necessitate long confinement indoors, but such an arrangement is extremely difficult. After their return from the Sanatorium, the Sanatorium principles were observed as far as possible. The windows were kept open day and night, winter and summer. Six have died, and I have not been able to trace the addresses of nine of those who had been in the Sanatoria. Of the fourteen that have been discharged from the Sanatorium for three years and longer, one is dead, two are in a fair condition, six appear to be quite well and have continued regularly at their usual occupation, and three are not doing well. I have lost sight of the remaining two. Of the 34 that have been discharged for one year and under three years, 17 are doing well, three are in a fair condition, two are in an unsatisfactory condition, five are dead, and seven have left leaving no address. Of the 19 men of military age who occupied the Council's beds in Fairlight Sanatorium, nine followed their occupations regularly after their discharge, four of these, after having passed a strict medical examination, j oined the Army and, in spite of four months of drilling, &c., during a very trying winter, their health is still satisfactory. This is evidence that the improvement in the condition of their lungs was of a permanent character. Of the remaining 10, the addresses of four cannot be ascertained, but when last seen, they were in good health. One is in a fair condition, one is not progressing favourably and four have died. Mrs. W., aged 24, of Lower Chapman Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on July 17th, 1911, where she remained for four months. She gained 9 lbs. in weight, and on her discharge her temperature was normal. She could walk one or two miles and do housework without difficulty. The breath sounds were weak at the apices of both lungs, but no crepitations could be heard. Her general health was much improved. Six-and-a-half months after her discharge it was found that her pulmonary condition was about the same. There has been some return of the symptons. She has been undergoing treatment with tuberculin at the Tuberculosis Dispensary. Her temperature kept normal. She attended the Stepney Green Dispensary until July, 1912, but since that date she has been attending St. George's Dispensary. 3 years after her discharge from the Sanatorium, there were no signs of active disease, and she was able to do housework. She had no cough or expectoration, although she had lost flesh. M. W., aged 25, of Raymond Street (now of Old Tower Buildings), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on July 17th, 1911, and remained there for 4 months. She gained nearly 7 lbs. in weight, and on her discharge her temperature was quite normal. She could walk two or three miles, 42 and do housework without difficulty. Fine crepitations could be heard at the apices of both lungs. Her "general health was excellent, and the condition of lungs in statu quo." 6½ months after her discharge, it was found that there had been a return of symptoms. On examination, it was found that there was extension of the disease. She was not doing well. She got married in 1912, and had a baby in October, 1913. Since the baby was born she got worse, and her condition became very unsatisfactory. She attended the St. George's Dispensary regularly from July, 1912 to July, 1914. At the end of 1914 she had a slight cough and was very thin. H. G., aged 24, of Anthony Street (now of Jane Street), was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on August 28th, 1911, and after remaining there for 3 months left against the advice of the Medical Superintendent, although there was little or no activity of the disease at that time. The doctor thought it would have been wiser to wait for a few weeks longer in order that he might have been tested with the hardest grade of work. 6 months afterwards, there was no return of the symptoms. The pulmonary condition showed no return of activity, and he was doing well. 21 years afterwards he appeared to be very fit. He gained 15 lbs. at the Sanatorium, and since his discharge he had gained another 26 lbs. in weight. He did not return to the tailoring trade on leaving the Sanatorium, but joined his father as a poulterer. He had no cough or expectoration, and did not receive medical treatment of any kind. 3¼ years after his discharge he was maintaining his strength and was able to carry on his work. With the exception of a slight cough he has no symptoms of the disease. E. B., aged 38, of Charles Street (now of Spring Garden Place), was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on September 4th, 1911. At the end of 4 months the Medical Superintendent reported that the patient was not very robust, but that there was not much, if any, active disease. His general physique was poor, and he doubted his capacity of performing hard work. For the last month his temperature had not risen above 99 degrees, in spite of the fact that he had been doing moderately hard work, e.g., digging broken ground, scrubbing and garden sweeping. He had gained 14 lbs. in weight. 2 months after leaving the Sanatorium he had no return of symptoms. The chest conditions had apparently healed. 2¼ years afterwards he had lost some weight. He received the Tuberculin treatment, until the middle of 1913. The cough had been rather troublesome, especially night and morning, but not much expectoration. He had suffered from irregularity of temperature, which had caused him to lose several days work. Unfortunately, he had to return to his former occupation—that of cooper—where there is much dust and smoke. At the end of 1914 he had joined the Army and was attached to the Royal Engineers. The symptoms must have disappeared or he would not have passed the medical examination and withstood 4 or 5 months' active drill. 43 A. H. V., aged 19, of William's Buildings, Ann Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium, on October 2nd, 1911, where lie remained for 8 months, when he decided to emigrate to Canada, where a position was found for him on a dairy farm, and all arrangements were made by the Sanatorium Authorities. The Medical Superintendent considered this gave him the best chance. He had done very well at the Sanatorium, and for months he was doing the hardest form of manual work without difficulty, or rise of temperature. The Medical Superintendent was of opinion that the disease, therefore, was perfectly arrested. 18 months afterwards, he was doing well in Canada, and had no return of his symptoms. F. C. H., aged 30, of Oxford Street (now of Wellesley Street), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1911, where she remained for 4 months. She gained 18½ lbs. and her temperature on discharge was normal. She could walk 2 or 3 miles, and do light housework without difficulty. The percussion note was dull at the apices of both lungs and the expiration was prolonged. There was marked improvement in her general condition, and no Tubercle Bacilli could be found in the sputum. After her return home, she was confined and her symptoms returned. She attended at the Tuberculosis Dispensary, where she received the Tuberculin treatment. 2½ years afterwards, she was able to do housework, and appeared to be keeping in good health, although she had not been able to return to her trade—tailoring. She had not lost weight since she was discharged. Towards the end of October she had a relapse and was admitted into the Mile End Infirmary. J. H., aged 20, a brass finisher of Settles Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on October 16th, 1911, where he remained for 5 months. He got on very well at the Sanatorium. On his discharge, there was no sign of active disease, and no Tubercle Bacilli could be found in the sputum. For 5 weeks, he was doing Grade IV. work without discomfort, and his average daily temperature was 97 to 98.2 degrees. He gained 16 lbs. in weight, and the Medical Superintendent considered that the disease had been arrested. Three months after his discharge he had no return of activity of symptoms, although he had lost 6 lbs. in weight. He received the Tuberculin treatment at the Stepney Green Dispensary. He attended at the Dispensary until June, 1912. He was then 9 lbs. heavier than when he went to the Sanatorium, and had only a slight cough and expectoration. His present address cannot be ascertained. E. K., aged 35, a plumber of Watt's Street Buildings, was admitted to the Fairlight Sanatorium on October 23rd, 1911. I informed the Public Health Committee that I did not consider the patient a suitable case for Sanatorium treatment and that the report of the Council's Medical Referee was unsatisfactory. It was, however, decided to send him to the Medical Referee of the Sanatorium, who accepted him, and he was sent to the Sanatorium. The Medical Superintendent of the latter 44 institution wrote on November 14th that he did not think any good purpose would be served by keeping the patient there much longer. He had advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, and, in addition, his general health was feeble. Since his admission he had made no real progress. His temperature had been constantly up to and over 101 degrees, and was not affected by rest in bed to any extent. He was of opinion that he was not a suitable case for a Sanatorium. E. K. died on November 30th. W. E., aged 39, of Johnson Street (now moved to Coburg Buildings), was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on November 27th, 1911, where he remained for 10 weeks. The Medical Superintendent reported that, considering the comparatively short time he was at the institution he had got on very well. He had extensive lung disease and early tuberculous laryngitis. There was, however, distinct diminution in the activity of the disease in both localities. He had gained 21 lbs. in weight, and for a considerable time he had no abnormal rise of temperature. He was able to do such work as light digging, carrying earth, &c., for 4 hours a day. Three months after his discharge he had lost 6 lbs. in weight. The pulmonary condition showed some activity, and he was undergoing the tuberculin treatment at the Dispensary until April, 1913. Two years afterwards he was in a fair condition, and had not lost a day's work as a crane driver on account of illness during this period, and had no cough or expectoration; but towards the latter half of 1914 he became worse, and was admitted to the Downs Sanatorium on September 22nd, and remained there for two months. He made a slight improvement, but left, for family reasons. He was recommended for domiciliary treatment. He is not doing well. His wife, R. E., aged 36, was admitted to the Maitland Sanatorium on April 14th, 1913, and remainded there for 2 months. She gained 9 lbs. in weight and her temperature became normal. Her walking capacity was 4 miles, and she was doing various grades of housework. During the first month at the Sanatorium her physical signs increased, but cleared up later. The Medical Superintendent was of opionion that Dispensary care was necessary after her discharge. She attended at the Dispensary for some time, but gave it up, as she strongly objected to the tuberculin treatment. In the meantime, she had become pregnant. She had no cough or expectoration, and was able to do housework comfortably. Eighteen months after her discharge her improvement was maintained, but she is still kept under supervision by the Stepney Dispensary. She is 7 lbs. heavier than when she left the Sanatorium. A. H., aged 27, of Gun Street (now of Sandringham Road, Dalston), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on December 11th, 1911, where she remained for nearly 3 months, when she gained 1 stone in weight. Her temperature on discharge was quite normal, and she could walk well and do hard work without difficulty. Her breathing was good, and she was free from cough. She made excellent progress while at the Sanatorium. Three months afterwards there had been no return of symptoms nor any sign of a return of activity. 45 Six months after her discharge she had lost about 5 lbs., but her physical signs were practically normal. There was no cough or temperature. Three years afterwards she appeared quite well, and has had no illness since her return home. She had no cough or expectoration, but attended occasionally at the Whitechapel Dispensary. She is a stone heavier than when she left the Sanatorium. L.G., aged 8, of Selby Street, was admitted on November 13th, 1911, and discharged on October 11th, 1912, having gained a stone in weight; her temperature was normal and walking capacity 3 miles. The Medical Superintendent reported that the patient was much better in general health, the physical signs in the chest being much less, but there was a considerable area of disease. This appears to have become of a chronic nature, but is not interfering with the child's ordinary life. Her temperature was steady, and she had very little cough. She kept well for about a year after her discharge. Since then she has lost weight, and her condition is not so good. She is at present at the Harpenden Sanatorium. H. S., aged 37, a tailor's cutter, of Selby Street, was admitted to the Fairlight Sanatorium on November 1st, 1911. The Committee considered the report as to his condition on September 26th; but, on account of the recent Dock Strike and other domestic circumstances, he was allowed to remain at the Sanatorium until the end of 1912, when he was taken on as a porter at the Sanatorium. He has since been employed as sculleryman at the Sanatorium, and at the end of 1913 was in good health. He has not been off duty on account of ill-health since he became a member of the staff. L. C., aged 18, a tailor, of Terrace Place (now of Brook Street), was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on December 7th, 1911, and left on April 13th, 1912. On his discharge he was enjoying excellent health, and was fit to return to work. He gained 20 lbs. in weight, and the Medical Superintendent considered that the disease was arrested. 15 months afterwards he was the same weight as when he went to the Sanatorium, and attended the Stepney Green Dispensary. 2 years after he left the Sanatorium he felt quite fit and well. He had no cough, expectoration or night sweats. His present address is not known. M. T., aged 39, of the Philpot Street Synagogue (now of Dunstan's Buildings, Brook Street), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on January 29th, and left on April 22nd. During her stay of 3 months she gained 17½ lbs. in weight, weighing 11 st. 1¼ lbs. on leaving the Sanatorium. She could walk well and do housework. Dry crepitations were still heard at the apex. The Medical Superintendent was of opinion that she made excellent improvement in general health, but needed further care. She continued to attend at the Stepney Green Dispensary and received the tuberculin treatment until September of the same year. Three years after her discharge from the Sanatorium she was in a fair condition, but complains of a cough and has lost weight. She is not able to do any work. 46 H. B., aged 35, of Jamaica Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on February 26th, 1912, and left on April 22nd. During her stay of 2 months she gained 10¼ lbs. in weight, weighing 9 st. 3¼ lbs. on leaving the Sanatorium; she could walk 4 miles comfortably and do housework well. The upper third of the right lung was involved. The Medical Superintendent considered she had made excellent improvement in general health, but that she still needed further care. Three years afterwards she was able to do housework, but had lost weight since her discharge. H. H., aged 27, of Fieldgate Mansions, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on February 27th, 1912, and left on June 8th. During his stay of 3½ months he gained 22 lbs. in weight, weighing 9st. 13¼ lbs. on leaving the Sanatorium. The Medical Superintendent was of opinion that the disease was arrested. Nearly 3 years afterwards he was in fairly good condition. He was in constant work as a cigarette-maker. He had not lost a day's work since he left the Sanatorium, although his cough troubled him occasionally. He had lost weight. V. E., aged 12, of Copperfield Road, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on March 5th, 1912, and left on October 11th, 1912, having gained 2 st. in weight. Her temperature on discharge was normal and her walking capacity was 3 miles. Practically no abnormal physical signs were present in the lungs when she was discharged. Her progress at the Sanatorium was excellent. This patient has gone to Edmonton and her present address cannot be found. J. K., aged 29, a tailor's machinist, of Little Turner Street, was admitted to the Fairlight Sanatorium on March 27th, 1912, and left on June 17th, 1912. During his stay of 3 months he gained 15 lbs. in weight, weighing 10 st. 2½ lbs. when he left, and had improved very much in health. He left the Sanatorium because the only other patient who could speak Yiddish was also leaving. The Medical Superintendent did not recommend it as the disease was not yet arrested, and a further stay would have been advisable. This patient has left the district and his present address cannot be traced. E. S., aged 32, a waistcoat hand, of Senrab Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on April 22nd, 1912, and discharged on July 15th, 1912. Her weight on admission was 6 st. 8¾ lbs., and on discharge 7 st. 8¼ lbs. Her temperature on admission was 99 degrees, and on discharge normal. She was able to walk several miles, and her working capacity was good. No abnormal physical signs could be detected in the lungs on her discharge. The Medical Superintendent reported that her progress at the Sanatorium was excellent. She attended the Stepney Green Dispensary until May, 1913, when she was keeping well. She has left Senrab Street and her present address cannot be ascertained. M. A., aged 43, of Devonshire Street (now of Stepney Green), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on April 24th, 1912, and left on July 17th, 1912. Her weight 47 on admission was 8 st. 4 lbs., and on discharge 9¾st. Her temperature remained normal. She was able to walk 3 miles and do full work, as well as gardening. There were still slight physical signs in the lower lobe of the left lung. The Medical Superintendent reported that her progress at the Sanatroium was excellent. 2| years afterwards, she had lost some of the weight gained at the Sanatorium. The cough and expectoration had returned to a slight extent, and is now attending at the Stepney Green Dispensary. She was able to do housework comfortably. J. S., aged 30, of Duckett Street (now of Knott Street), was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on May 30th, 1912, and discharged on August 31st, 1912, when he showed no sign of active disease. He was doing the hardest grade of manual work for the last fortnight of his stay in the Sanatorium without any rise of temperature. During his stay he gained 34 lbs. in weight, and the Medical Superintendent was of opinion that the disease had been arrested. Soon afterwards he suffered from Duodenal ulcer, and was taken to the London Hospital. After his discharge from the Hospital he was in good health and followed his occupation as a wood-sawyer. He had no cough or expectoration. He has now joined the Army. V. M., aged 37, a carman, of Albion Street, was admitted to the Sanatorium on June 17th, 1912, and left on September 23rd, 1912, having gained 21 lbs. in weight, and was doing the hardest grade of manual work on discharge without discomfort or rise of temperature. The Medical Superintendent recommended a course of Tuberculin treatment, and arrangements were made with the Stepney Dispensary for this purpose. He attended at the Dispensary for some time, and continued to do well. He has now joined the Army. F. C., aged 33, of Fair Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on July 6th, 1912, and discharged on October 5th. The right side did not expand as well as the left. There were no signs of active disease, and no Tubercle Bacilli in the sputum. He gained 1 st. in weight and left fit for work. 2½ years afterwards he continued to feel fit, and had not lost a day's work on account of illness since he had left the Sanatorium. He is employed as a clerk. S. W., aged 31, of White Horse Lane, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on July Nth, 1912, and discharged on September 11th. Her weight on admission was 8 st. 7 lbs. and on discharge 9 st. 3½ lbs. The temperature on discharge was normal and her walking capacity 5 miles. She was able to do a full day's work. The condition of lungs was very indefinite, occasional moist sounds being heard over the left apex. The report on the progress at the Sanatorium was very good. 6 months after returning home she lost weight, and she became an inmate of Mile End Infirmary for 3 weeks. 48 1½ years after her discharge her condition had not improved. She was thin, coughed a great deal, and stated that she occasionally expectorated blood-stained sputum. She continued to attend at the Stepney Green Dispensary. Her present address is not known. M. P., aged 21, cork cutter, of Love Lane (now of Brook Street), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on July 17th, 1912, and left on October 8th, having gained 1 st. in weight. Her temperature on discharge was normal. Her walking capacity was 5 to 6 miles, and she was able to do full C. work. The apex of her right lung was involved (early). Her progress at the Sanatorium was excellent. 1½ years afterwards she had not lost a day's work on account of illness. She had lost a little weight, but not much. She had no cough or expectoration. At the end of 1914 she was in good health, and had no return of any bad symptoms. She got married this year. A. N., aged 14, draper's assistant, of Albert Square, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on July 26th, 1912, where he remained for 11 months. He gained 22 lbs. in weight, and there were no signs of active disease when he left. He did the highest grade of manual work without the slightest discomfort or rise of temperature. During the two years nearly since he left the Sanatorium he had not lost a day's work on account of illness ; he had no cough, and had gained weight. R. A., aged 11, of Langdale Mansions, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1912, and discharged on April 4th, 1913. She gained 10½ lbs. in weight and her temperature was normal. She had made excellent progress, her cough and sputum being much less. On her arrival at the Sanatorium her sputum was crowded with Tubercle Bacilli, but was quite free prior to her discharge. Her condition a year afterwards was not so good. She coughed a great deal. She had not been to school since her discharge, and spent most of the time in the open air. Tubercle Bacilli are still found in the sputum, but she has gained weight. She is attending the out-patient department of Mount Vernon Hospital. E. B., aged 31, a hawker, of Rutland Street (now living at Nelson Street), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1912, and discharged on January 3rd, 1913. She gained 12¼ lbs. in weight. Her temperature was normal and her walking and working capacity were good. The physical signs in both lungs had quite cleared up. She made very good progress. She remained well for 5 months, when she commenced to lose weight. Since then she has been attending the Brompton Hospital. 2¼ years after her discharge from the Sanatorium she was in a poor physical condition, and was only able to follow her occupation intermittently. Her cough was troublesome during the winter months. R. D., aged 16, an errand girl, of St. Ann's Road (now of Orange Street, W.), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1912, and discharged on 49 January 3rd, 1913. She gained 13 lbs. in weight, and her temperature was normal. Her walking capacity was good and her working capacity was fair. There was some stickiness of breath sounds over the second and third intercostal spaces, where formerly there were definite crepitations. Her general condition was much improved and her lungs showed distinct improvement. She did not attend any Dispensary for after-treatment. She resumed her duties, but was not able to continue for long periods. 2 ¼ years after her discharge she had gained weight and her cough had disappeared. She worked intermittently. G. H., aged 47, a hawker, of Maidman Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on October 21st, 1912, and was discharged on December 6th. He left at his own request and against the advice of the Medical Superintendent. He was doing Grade III. work, with only an occasional rise of temperature to 99 degrees. His weight was quite maintained. He only attended once at the Dispensary after his discharge, in July, 1913, when his symptoms had returned. Moist sounds could be heard in the chest. 2 years afterwards his condition was not so good, the cough and expectoration had returned. He was not able to follow his employment as a hawker regularly. W. C., aged 42, of Maplin Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on July 31st, 1912, and discharged on September 7th. The apex of the right lung was affected. He made very satisfactory progress during his stay at the Sanatorium, gaining over 18 lbs. in weight. He was able to do Grade III. work, and for the last week or two his temperature was normal, except on two occasions, when it touched 99 degrees. The Medical Superintendent did not consider that he was fit to leave when he did, and told him so. 2¼ years after his discharge he kept well, and worked regularly as a shoemaker. He was free from cough and expectoration. He did not receive any after-treatment at a Dispensary. E. H., aged 21, a tie cutter, of Peabody Buildings, Commercial Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on September 13th, 1912, and was discharged on April 5th, 1913. He had advanced disease, affecting both lungs. When he left he was doing Grade IV. work without rise of temperature. There was still Tubercle Bacilli in the sputum and crepitations could be heard; but the Medical Superintendent considered that the disease was not active, and that he was fit for work. He gained 1 st. in weight. He attended at Margaret Street Hospital as an out-patient, but died a year after his discharge from the Sanatorium. L.J., aged 23, a carpenter, of Mile End Road (now of Leyton), was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on September 13th, 1912, and was advised to leave on November 16th, as he was suffering from fits. The fits appeared to be increasing in frequency and severity. There was no sign of active disease in the lungs, the 50 sputum being free from Tubercle Bacilli. His temperature was generally below 99 degrees, but was distinctly influenced (for about two days) by the occurrence of a fit. His general health was very fair and he gained 12 lbs. in weight. 2 years afterwards he had not lost weight, and had been feeling well. He had not had a fit for 3 months, and the cough had entirely disappeared. He has now moved out of the district, but comes up to see me periodically. He has now joined the Army, and his firm is keeping his place open for him. E. P., aged 20, a boxmaker, of Albion Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on September 23rd, 1912. The temperature on her discharge was about 101 degrees. Both lungs were extensively and acutely involved. She made no progress. The Medical Superintendent was of opinion that it was a very acute case and unsuitable for Sanatorium; he advised her discharge, which was done on October 18th. Soon after her discharge, she became an in-patient at the Mile End Infirmary for 5 months, and afterwards attended at the Stepney Green Dispensary. She gave birth to a child in 1913. At the end of 1914 she was 2 st. 2 lbs. heavier than when she went to the Sanatorium. She has no cough and is able to do housework comfortably. E. F., aged 29, of Harford Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 23rd, 1912, and discharged on January 13th, 1913. She gained 11¼ lbs. in weight. Her walking capacity was 3 to 4 miles. There was slightly prolonged expiration and plus vocal resonance over the right upper lobes as well as crepitations in the second space near the sternum. There was nothing abnormal in the left lung. She made very great improvement in the Sanatorium. She left the above address soon afterwards, and her present address cannot be traced. E. R., aged 15, of Skidmore Street (now of Single Street), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on January 11th, 1913, where she remained for 3 months. She gained 131 lbs. in weight, and her walking capacity was good. Her temperature was normal, and she made excellent progress. She lost her cough and had no expectoration. A year afterwards she had lost most of the weight gained at the Sanatorium, but has since regained it and is now 4 lbs. heavier than when she left the Sanatorium. She has not attended any Dispensary or received medical attention since leaving the Sanatorium. She appears to be keeping well, and works regularly in a drug warehouse. F. E. G., aged 11, of Parnham Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on January 28th, 1913, where she remained for 2 months, and gained 8 lbs. in weight. Her breath sounds were weaker on the right side, but no adventitious sounds could be heard. Her progress at the Sanatorium was quite good, especially during the second month. Exercise and drill improved her breathing. The improvement was well maintained during the 21 months that have elapsed since she left Maitland. She had no cough and her nutrition was good. 51 Mrs. B., aged 25 of, White's Row, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on February 24th, 1913, but only remained 1 month, when she left at her own wish. She gained 6 lbs. in weight. She had harsh expiration and a slight cough, but no adventitious sounds could be heard. She had a slight attack of Hæmatemesis. She continued fairly well after her return, but a year afterwards, she was admitted to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, suffering from perforated gastric ulcer, where she was operated on. She was an in-patient of the Hospital for nearly 4 months. If years afterwards she was quite free from cough and was able to do her work comfortably. She occasionally attends the Whitechapel Dispensary. M. S., aged 26, of Exmouth Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on April 7th, 1913, and remained there for 4 months. She gained 6 lbs. in weight, and her temperature on discharge was quite normal. Her walking capacity was 5 miles, and her working capacity was fair. She had no cough or expectoration when she was discharged. She made good progress at the Sanatorium, her physical signs clearing up; the Medical Superintendent was of opinion that she should receive Dispensary care, but she has not availed herself of this opportunity. She kept in fair condition until Christmas, 1913, when she seemed to lose ground, and two months afterwards, she had Haemoptysis. She died on December 23rd, 1914. S. S., aged 38, of Cressy Houses, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on April 28th, 1913, where he remained for 3 months, and made fair progress. On his discharge the Medical Superintendent was of opinion that the disease was still active and the patient had considerable amount of cough, due to his throat condition, as well as to his chest trouble. He was informed that he ought not to work in London, and might have fair health if he were in good surroundings. On his discharge he attended the Stepney Green Dispensary. His throat symptoms have not improved. He has lost all the weight he put on at the Sanatorium. He continued at his work as a traveller for 5 months but had not been able to work regularly since. The family, which consists of man, wife, and two children, occupies two rooms only, the kitchen being also used as a sleeping apartment. He died towards the end of 1914. S. S., aged 28, of Jewell Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on June 9th, 1913, and remained for 5 months. She gained 11½ lbs. in weight, but became easily tired. On her discharge she had very little cough and no expectoration. Her general condition improved, but she had very little stamina. She left the above address just before Christmas, 1913, and her present home is unknown. N. L., aged 33, of Green Dragon Yard, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on July 15th, 1913, where he remained for 6 months. He had very little resisting power, and his lung condition did not improve during the latter part of his stay at the Sanatorium. His general health improved, that is, he gained 15 lbs. in weight, but his temperature continued to rise to nearly 100 degrees and his cough was very troublesome. He died on June 12th, 1914. D 52 S. C., aged 29, of Fulbourne Street, was admitted to the Maitland Sanatorium on August 26th, 1913, and remained there for 3 months. She gained 7 lbs. in weight and her temperature was normal. Her cough and expectoration disappeared. She was very despondent and was advised to have Dispensary treatment. After her discharge she has been attending the Whitechapel Dispensary, but her present address cannot be traced. M.S., aged 50, a plumber of Eric Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on September 9th, 1913, and discharged on November 8th. He gained a stone in weight and his temperature became normal. The Medical Superintendent reported that his sputum was free from Tubercle Bacilli, and as regards his chest, he saw no reason why he should not remain well. In a day or two, however, he was admitted to the Victoria Park Chest Hospital, where he died on November 16th from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Tuberculous Enteritis. S. S., aged 28, of Bromhead Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 27th, where she remained for 3 months and gained 6 lbs. in weight. Her walking and working capacity were good. She had not much cough, but she expectorated a great deal in the mornings. No Tubercle Bacilli were found in the sputum when she was discharged. After her discharge she attended at the Stepney Green Dispensary for some time, but she is now attending the Mount Vernon Hospital. She has lost weight, but she is able to do her work all right. I. V., aged 44, a bootmaker of Graces Alley, was admitted to the Fairlight Sanatorium on November 10th, 1913, and remained there for 4 months, where he gained 27 lbs. in weight. His temperature was quite normal when he was discharged. The Medical Superintendent considered him to be in good condition and should keep well. At the end of 1914 he was able to follow his occupation regularly. G. G., aged 36, of Fieldgate Mansions (now of Spelman Street), was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on November 27th, 1913, where she remained for 11 weeks. She gained 10 lbs. in weight and her temperature was normal on her discharge. Her walking and working capacity were good. Dry crepitations were heard over the left apex. The cough was very slight and no Tubercle Bacilli were found in the sputum. She made excellent progress at the Sanatorium, but Dispensary care was advised. At the end of 1914 she was quite free from cough or any other unfavourable symptom, and was able to do housework comfortably. Infantile Mortality. 1,000 infants died under one year of age or 83 more than in the previous year. 236 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 134 per 1,000 births; 227 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 152 per 1,000 births; 53 383 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 119 per 1,000 births. 154 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 101 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality for the whole Borough was 125 per 1,000 births, while that for the whole of London was 104 per 1,000 births. Deaths of Illegitimate Children. There were 44 deaths of illegitimate children under one year of age, or at the rate of 321 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 6 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 333 per 1,000 illegitimate births; 12 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 375 per 1,000 illegitimate births; 14 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 250 per 1,000 illegitimate births; 12 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 387 per 1,000 illegitimate births. Work of the Health Visitors. It is now several years since the first efforts were made in the Borough for the reduction of the immense loss of infant life that occurs annually. It was realised that this high mortality was due in large part to the ignorance of mothers of the principles which govern the rearing of healthy children, as well as to carelessness and neglect. The damage done by this ignorance does not end with the large number of deaths that occur, but results also in the impairment of the physical and mental condition of the surviving infants. It follows that all work done with the aim of reducing infantile mortality, must lead also to an improvement in the health of the survivors, and finally, to the improvement of the race. Within the past few years advantage has been increasingly taken of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, to set in motion schemes on behalf of infant welfare. The success of these schemes has been such, that the Local Government Board became convinced of the advisability of such work being undertaken more generally than was hitherto the case. With the object of encouraging the extension of already existing activities and the adoption of new measures, a grant has been voted by Parliament in aid of expenditure incurred by Local Authorities, and Voluntary Societies, in carrying out improved schemes of work. D 2 54 This grant is to be administered by the Local Government Board or by the Board of Education according to the lines on which the work is done. Circular letters have been sent by these Boards to all Local Authorities and Infant Health Societies outlining schemes of work which will be approved by them. Two schemes are suggested (1) The Local Government Board, taking into consideration the fact that a considerable proportion of the loss of infant life is due to pre-natal causes, recommends where desirable, the provision of adequate treatment and systematic advice for expectant mothers, and for infants and children up to school age, at a Clinic, or other suitable institution. The appointment of Health Visitors would be necessary. Part of their duty would be the visiting of expectant mothers and young children in the home. (2) The Board of Education is anxious for the establishment and extension of all work, having as its object, the education of mothers in the simple rules of health to be observed in the up-bringing of infants and children up to school age. The work will include, primarily, home visiting by Health Visitors, to be followed up by the institution of Infant Consultations (as distinct from Infant Clinics), and by arrangement for courses of lectures for mothers on subjects relating to the management of children and the home. It may be noticed that both Boards lay stress on the importance of keeping children under observation until such time as they are admitted to school. Formerly, visiting has been discontinued at twelve months. In Stepney, all the work done on behalf of the babies up to the present time has been organised on methods similar to those suggested by the Board of Education in its circular. For the greater part of this work, the Borough is indebted to Voluntary Societies, which are maintaining Schools for Mothers in different parts of Stepney. The Stepney Mothers' and Babies' Welcome, Commercial Road, was opened in July, 1909. More than two years ago, the St. George-in-the-East and Wapping Infant Welfare Association was formed. The Jewish Maternity District Nursing and Sick-Room Helps Society set in operation a Mothers' and Babies' Welcome in Cannon Street Road for the Jewish population in Stepney. Attached to all of these Schools for Mothers are Health Visitors, who visit the babies as soon as possible after birth, and who follow up the first visit when the conditions are such that re-visits will be profitable 55 In Limehouse, St. George's and Wapping, the Municipal Health Visitors work in co-operation with the staff of the Voluntary Societies in these districts. The area covered by all the Health Visitors working in the Borough includes the whole of Limehouse, Shadwell, Ratcliffe, St. George-in-the-East and Wapping. Some of the Jewish mothers in Whitechapel, Spitalfields and Mile End are also visited. Every mother visited has the opportunity of attending with her baby one of the numerous Consultations in the Borough, and invitations are also given to these mothers to attend the classes of instruction, which are held under the auspices of the Voluntary Societies. A superintendent of cither Society is in attendance at the School for Mothers, Commercial Road, and at the office of the St. George-in-the-East and Wapping Infant Welfare Association on every morning of the week, when mothers who are needing help, or advice, or practical demonstration in the preparation of food, &c., are welcomed. It is usually the mothers who are attending the Consultations who avail themselves of this method of obtaining individual instruction. The number of babies born in Stepney during 1914 that were visited are as follows:— Visited by Municipal Visitor for Limehouse 1,056 ,, „ „ St. George-in-the-East (August to December) 298 „ St. George-in-the-East Infant Welfare Association Health Visitor (January to July) 363 „ Stepney Mothers' Welcome Health Visitor (March to December) 2 44 „ Jewish Mothers' and Babies' Welcome Health Visitors 1,118 INFANT CONSULTATIONS, 1914.

One of these dining rooms is established in Church Street, Minories. Nursing and expectant mothers in suitable cases are provided with daily dinners. An infant clinic is also held at this Centre. A doctor attends once every week in the afternoon; he examines the babies and instructs the mothers as to training and feeding, and treats minor ailments. Any babies from the neighbourhood may be brought to this clinic, although it is meant primarily for the children of mothers having dinners. Here again, classes of instruction are given every week in sewing and knitting. The results of providing dinners for mothers arc usually beneficial and often very far-reaching. A particular instance will best illustrate this point. At the first visit, the baby was found to be small, thin, and very fretful. The mother looked underfed, was in a very depressed state of health, and seemed indifferent. The home was dirty and untidy, and conditions generally were most unsatisfactory. There were four other children, the eldest of whom was 12 years of age. As usual, the mother was inclined, on account of the poor condition of the baby, to discontinue breast feeding, and to put the child on the bottle. She was, however, persuaded to attend the dinners regularly, and to persevere with breast feeding. After a little while, the mother's health showed decided change for the better, and the condition of the baby gradually improved. This improvement has been steadily maintained. The progress of the baby, and her own returning strength, encouraged the mother to greater cleanliness, both as regards herself, her children, and the home. She became neater in her person, and kept her baby clean and comfortably clothed. The mother now goes out cleaning several days in the week, and yet, in spite of this, the home conditions are much more satisfactory than formerly. In nearly all cases, the condition and health of the baby at birth, is quite satisfactory. That the babies are well developed and in good condition at the first visit, is shown in the following table:— Number of babies visited, 1,757. Good condition 87 per cent. Fair condition 10 „ Bad condition 3 „ At the first visit the babies are, with few exceptions, breast fed. Among first babies, the proportion of bottle fed is higher than in other cases. Number of babies visited, 1,757— Breast fed 92.2 per cent. Mixed feeding—breast and bottle 4.2 „ Bottle fed 3.6 „ 57 After the sixth week or thereabouts, breast feeding is often not maintained, nd for various reasons the mothers begin to give additional feeds. In some cases, the mother goes back to work at this time ; the baby is put out to be minded with a neighbour, who is often unfortunately too old to give the baby the care and attention it needs. In these cases, breast feeding is continued at night, and whenever possible the mother will return during the dinner hour to feed her baby. During the mother's absence, the child is fed from a bottle with cow's milk, or condensed, or dried milk. The bottle used for feeding is either the proper boat-shaped feeding bottle, or else a medicine bottle fitted with a wide mouthed teat. The latter arrangement is quite satisfactory. The filthy, long tube feeding-bottle has quite fallen into disuse in this district. The use of dried milk is growing more widespread, and results from it seem quite satisfactory, if it be not continuously used for too long a period. Its use during the summer months is advantageous. It can be kept free from dust and flies, in a closed tin, and the risk of contamination is reduced. The difficulty of keeping cow's milk fresh and pure, during the hot season, in homes where there is no provision for suitable storage, is so great as to make its use for babies very unsafe, unless the mother is an intelligent careful woman. The greatest evils as regards feeding, that the Health Visitor has to contend with are, firstly, irregularity of feeding, and secondly, the giving of additional feeds of sop made with bread or biscuit, oatmeal or cornflour, usually on the recommendation of the grandmother. Both of these evils result in digestive disturbance, and often end with causing wasting disease. Irregularity of feeding is the beginning of a bad habit which continues throughout childhood. In many of these cases, the Health Visitor is handicapped by the fact, that the mothers are getting to know, almost too well, what account of baby the Health Visitor likes to hear, and what she disapproves of. It is often said, that baby is having the breast milk only, every two hours regularly, and that the sop standing on the table is for the older baby, aged about 2 years The mothers have made some progress as regards feeding is obvious, as it is rarely found, nowadays, that young infants have such unsuitable food as was formerly the case. However, quite recently when one of the Health Visitors called at a certain house, she found the mother and her first baby, aged 3 weeks, at breakfast. The mother was having bacon and eggs, and the baby, bacon fat, and the yolk of egg ! 58 A few illustrations are here given of the way in which the Health Visitors have been able to help and advise as to feeding. (1) A case considered necessary to be visited very frequently was that of a woman who suffered from very bad health, and who had been an inmate of a lunatic asylum for eight months after the death of her previous baby. She had lost ten children, all under the age of 14 months, and she seemed anxious that this, her eleventh child, should live. The book of "Advice to Mothers" was given to her, but unfortunately she could not read. Detailed instructions as to feeding were given, and these were carried out. Particular attention was paid to this case when the baby was being weaned. The child's condition was fairly satisfactory at twelve months old. (2) A baby girl at 4 months old weighed 6 lbs., and was in a very bad state of health when visited. She was dirty, and insufficiently clothed. The mother told the Health Visitor that she was giving her baby oatmeal to fatten the child. The mother was recommended to discontinue feeding with oatmeal, and to get medical treatment at once. The father was a casual labourer, to whom work was rather the exception than the rule; the mother made blouses at home, and had practically to support the home and the family on her earnings. She had therefore very little time to devote to the care of her home and her 4 children, the eldest of whom was 4 years old. The father was interviewed, and warned that if he did not make more effort to provide for his family, the case would be referred to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The warning apparently, had some effect, for he gave his wife a little more money each week. The child was taken to the London Hospital, and attended there until cured. The Almoner of the Hospital wrote to the Health Visitor of the improvement that had taken place, and said "the child looked much better and was cleanly and nicely dressed." (3) One mother resented very much being visited at first, and thought she was quite capable of looking after her baby without help. She admitted that she had lost four out of five children. She was unable to nurse them herself, and had to feed them artificially. She informed the Health Visitor that she had tried everything in the way of patent foods, and seemed very surprised because none of them were satisfactory. Modified cow's milk was recommended, and she promised to try it, although she had not much faith in it. Regular visits were made to her, and after much persuasion, the mother consented to go to the Babies' Welcome. She became interested, and continued to take the baby until he was 12 months old. At the last visit, the child was in a very good condition, he had six teeth and weighed 25 lbs. In advocating attendance at Infant Consultations, one still has to combat a good deal of prejudice and superstition, although indifference, too, is responsible for many of the non-attendances. 59 The excuses given to the Health Visitor by the mother, week after week, points to the possession of ingenuity, which, if exercised on behalf of the babies, should be a great asset in baby rearing. We must remember that many of the poorer mothers when they go to the Babies' Welcome, have to encounter a certain amount of opposition from relatives and neighbours. A large number of the women who attend, are of the more respectable class, and form the more reliable members of the Welcomes. There are, however, some centres of which the members consist almost entirely of wives of casual labourers. In such centres, the attendance is generally more irregular; the mothers begin well, but need careful re-visiting to encourage them to continue the good beginning. It is felt that this re-visiting is well worth while, since the opportunities for helping in such cases are unlimited. One baby, when first visited, was 8 weeks old. It was undersized and pallid, but was quite clean. The mother said it was fed on the breast only. On enquiry, it was found that this was the mother's sixth child, all of the others died before reaching the age of 12 months, and all had been fed artificially. The mother was advised to take the child to a Welcome, whereupon she began to make excuses. It was pointed out to her that her record was a bad one, and that if she really meant to do her best for the baby, as she said, she could prove her good intentions in no better way than by attending the Welcome regularly. The mother accepted the challenge, and took the baby to the Welcome, rather unwillingly on the first occasion, but has since attended fairly well. Recently the father fell out of work, and his wife was forced to resume work at home. On some occasions when she was too busy to leave her work, a neighbour was sent with the baby to the Welcome. The figures showing the total number of babies that have attended Infant Consultations, prove that the mothers appreciate the benefits to be obtained by attending these Welcomes. The following figures show the percentages of mothers working industrially during pregnancy both in the factory and at home, out of a total of 1,328, about whom particulars were obtained. Of the 1,328 mothers who worked during pregnancy either in the factory or at home:— 19 per cent. worked in factories. 69 per cent. did house work only 12 per cent. did other work. "Other work" includes all kinds of home work, office cleaning, washing and cleaning, away from home. Such work does not necessitate the baby being bottle fed, and on that account is preferable to factory work for mothers. On the other 60 hand, there is no doubt that this work, when undertaken continuously, may easily result in as much neglect of the home and the children, as factory work does. The return to work of many mothers is usually caused by necessity. Many of the fathers are casual labourers, and whether through their own fault or not, it is certain that these men rarely work throughout the week, with the result, that the allowance received by the wives, is quite inadequate for the purposes which it has to cover. Is it to be wondered at, that in cases such as these, many a careful mother feels that she must work herself, to increase the income, rather than, her children should want ? That several of the young mothers return to work, when there seems no real need, is due to the lack of any deep feelings of responsibility, either to their children, or to the homes. One case is known of a young mother with two children. The father enlisted recently, and the mother went back to her work in a factory at once, giving as her reason for doing so "that there was nothing to keep her at home now. The younger child is 12 months old." Another soldier's wife with 3 children persists in going out to work, although she knows that her mother, with whom she leaves the children, is incapable of looking after them adequately. The sense of motherhood, surely, is but imperfectly developed in these mothers. It is no rare occurrence to find children suffering from want of care where the mother goes to work. A family was found to be in very poor circumstances when first visited, for the father was out of work. Dinners were obtained for the mother from the Invalid Kitchen, for a period of three weeks, in order to strengthen her, and when the baby was 4 weeks old, the mother was able to resume work. The family removed, soon after, and was lost sight of. Some time later, a complaint was made by a mother, who was being visited, that the two children of the family occupying the upper part of the house, were neglected. This family proved to be the one that had removed. It seemed that the children were left in the father's care while his wife was at work, but he failed to look after them, and they were found to be in a filthy condition. The bed and bedding were also very dirty. The baby was wasted, the older child was covered with sores, and had bad eyes. Both were verminous. The case was referred to the Relieving Officer. The Parish Doctor visited, and ordered the immediate removal of the children to the Infirmary, where they were kept for three months. This intervention frightened the parents into greater efforts for cleanliness. The home was visited, occasionally, to ensure that the improved conditions were maintained. Fortunately bad cases such as this are exceptional 61 Dirty home conditions are often responsible for ill-health among the children. It is often found, that the unsatisfactory conditions are due to the mother getting disheartened, and this is not surprising, in view of the continual strain caused by overwork, and too often, by money difficulties, which many mothers have to endure. In these cases, much can be done to cheer and encourage the mother. A baby girl, 9 months old, suffering from Marasmus was taken to the London Hospital for treatment. The doctor suspected that the condition of the child was due to dirty conditions, and asked that the case might be looked into. The home was visited, and the conditions were found to be most unsatisfactory. The woman was urged to clean the room, and to take better care of the child, and instructions were given regarding suitable feeding. The home was visited regularly for a period of three months. During this time, great improvement was noted in the general conditions, as well as in the health of the child, who was discharged from the Hospital cured, at the age of a year. * Cases in which the babies suffer owing to ignorance and inexperience are of frequent occurrence. Inexperience often results in the children being improperly nursed during illness. When a child is under treatment, it is often found advisable to visit regularly, in order to help the mother to understand, and to show her, how to carry out the instructions given. A baby girl aged three months old was found to be suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. The mother had just returned with the baby from seeing the doctor. His instructions were to give the child nothing but albumen water and cold boiled water for 24 hours. At the time of visit, the mother was feeding the baby, simply because she was quite at a loss to know how to proceed. She was shown how to make the albumen water, and the importance of carrying out the doctor's orders implicitly was impressed upon her. The case was visited daily until the vomiting and diarrhoea had ceased, and the child showed definite signs of improvement. Old Age. 218 deaths were attributable to Old Age. This corresponds to a death rate of .80 per 1,000 of the population. 58 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1 .11 per 1,000. 32 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .69 per 1,000. 94 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .86 per 1,000. 34 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .52 per 1,000. 62 Table showing the ages of persons who died over 65 years of age and the localities:— Limehouse.

Two persons aged 95 died, one in the Whitechapel Infirmary and the other in the Mile End Infirmary. Alcoholism. The number of deaths due to Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver was 36, or 6 more than in the previous year. 8 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .15 per 1,000 of the population. 4 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .08 per 1,000 of the population. 11 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .09 per 1,000 of the population. 13 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .20 per 1,000 of the population. The death rate for the whole Borough was .13 per 1,000 of the population. Cancer. The deaths due to Cancer were 243, or 7 more than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death rate of .88 per 1,000 of the population. 52 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .99 per 1,000 of the population. 63 29 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .62 per 1,000 of the population. 89 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .80 per 1,000 of the population. 73 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 113 per 1,000 of the population. Deaths of the Homeless and of Inmates of Common Lodging Houses. During the year, there occurred in Lunatic Asylums, the deaths of 62 persons stated to have been removed into such institutions from this district, but for whom, no definite addresses could be given when the deaths were reported to the Registrars. 13 were stated to have been removed from the Limehouse district, 7 from St. George's, 17 from Mile End, and 25 from Whitechapel. 15, or nearly one-quarter, died from phthisis. There were 272 deaths in public institutions of persons admitted from common lodging-houses in the Borough. 64, or nearly a quarter, died from phthisis. The difficulty of dealing with these cases and preventing the spread of the disease, even when notified, is obvious. This difficulty is increased by the fact that, 25 of these persons who had died from consumption, had not been notified during their lifetime. With the exception of eight deaths, all the deaths referred to persons who were admitted from the Whitechapel district, where most of the common lodginghouses are situated. As the Borough possesses a river frontage of 2½ miles, a number of unknown persons are found drowned on the foreshore. These deaths are included in the death statistics for the districts in which the bodies are discovered. The bodies of four unknown persons were found, and were included in the Limehouse returns, together with those of eleven unknown persons who died at the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, two of whom died from phthisis. In the Mile End returns are included the deaths of three persons with unknown addresses, who died at the Mile End Infirmary. In the St. George's returns are included the deaths of 7 persons who died under similar conditions at the St. George's Infirmary, one of whom died from consumption. In the Whitechapel returns there are included 45 deaths of persons with unknown addresses, which occurred at the Whitechapel Workhouse and Infirmary, twelve having died from phthisis. 64 Glanders. Under the London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907, the Veterinary Inspector of the London County Council reported in accordance with the provisions of that Order, the existence of Glanders in two stables in the borough in which four horses were affected. Anthrax. Anthrax occurred in three stables in the Borough during the year and three horses died from the disease. No other horses were attacked in the same stables. One of the stables was situated in Mile End, one in Ratcliffe and one in Whitechapel Inhabited House Duty. Five applications were received for certificates under the Inland Revenue Act, 1903, for the purpose of securing exemption from Inhabited House Duty. The certificates granted related to 15 tenements. No applications were refused. Verminous Persons. 1,452 verminous persons were cleansed during the year and their clothing disinfected, 1,432 men, 13 women, 3 boys and 4 girls. Articles Destroyed on account of their condition and at the request of the Owners.

Scabies. A large number of patients attend at the London Hospital suffering from Scabies, for whom sulphur baths are provided. The bed and bedding of 535 patients were disinfected during the year, to obviate as far as possible re-infection after treatment. In 64 instances it was found impossible to verify the names and addresses given. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The number of bodies deposited in the Mortuary during the year was 518. Of these, 462 were removed by the Coroner, 47 by the Police, 5 at the request of friends, and 4 on my instructions. Four of the bodies were persons who had died from infectious diseases, and were placed in the infectious mortuary. 72 bodies were placed in the Jewish part of the Mortuary, and 30 were watched in accordance with the Jewish custom. 509 Inquests were held in the Coroner's Court, and 68 post-mortem examinations were made.

Pursuant to the Third Section of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, being the Registration Authority under the above Acts, has to report as follows with regard to the execution of such Acts and of the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken by them as such Authority during the year 1914, to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations, viz. (1) Canal boats coming within the district are inspected by a Sanitary Inspector who receives a sum of £10 per annum for the performance of this duty. His inspection is irrespective of the examination of boats made by the Examining Officer prior to their registration. (2) The number of Boats inspected in 1914 was 93, and the condition of the Boats and their occupants, as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations, was very good. (3) Infringements of Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows:— (a) Registration—Nil. (b) Notification of change of Master—Nil. (c) Certificates—One. (d) Marking—Nil. (e) Overcrowding—Nil.

Station Place.—19 houses were inspected ; most of them are two storey houses, the others being three-storey houses. Five are very near to the railway line, but they have very fair sized yards and ample open space at the back. These houses have recently been repaired, and the partitions in the front rooms on the first and second floors have been taken down, which greatly improved the front rooms. It was decided that no action should be taken under the above Act. Drewton Street.—As a result of a complaint, 10 houses were inspected in this street ; with the exception of the fact that the railway is so near, these premises are amongst the best cottages in the Borough. All the houses have large windows and good back yards. No action was taken. Turtle Cottage, at the rear of 244, Mile End Road.—An official representation was made that these premises were unfit for human habitation. The owner was interviewed by the Public Health Committee, and he agreed to carry out certain work which would render them habitable. These alterations were made, and no further action was taken. 14, 16 and 18, Garden Street.—A closing order was made under the Act in 1913 with regard to these three houses. These houses were not actually demolished, as no demolition order was made ; but they were converted into one house, No. 16 being utilised to make a complete and proper staircase. The improvements were satisfactory, and the closing order was rescinded. 23, Dupont Street.—A closing order was made with regard to this house on May 27th. The premises were closed, but no demolition order was made, as dangerous structure notices were served by the District Surveyor, and the premises were partly pulled down. Plough Street Buildings.—Numerous complaints have been received of late years of the condition of these premises. These complaints referred mostly to the conduct of the residents, and the insanitary condition in which the premises were kept, rather than to structural defects. They consist of 52 tenements, which were inspected, and an official representation was made with regard to Nos. 5a, 10b, 18, 22 and 24. The Committee interviewed the representative of the owners, who were beneficiaries under the will of the late mortgagee in possession. The premises were held on a lease, having about 50 years to run, at a ground rent of £75 per annum. Closing orders were made on May 27th, which were not appealed against. 69 Unsound Food Destroyed.

On March 23rd, Mr. David Van DeCar, of 37, Globe Road, was summoned for having deposited on his premises, for the purpose of sale, a quantity of sauerkraut, which was unsound and unfit for human food. He was fined £5, with 42s. costs. On June 17th, Mr. Abraham Spielsinger, of 11, Mile End Road, was summoned for having eggs which were unfit for food on his premises and for causing obstruction to the Inspector in the execution of his duty. He was fined £30, with 44s. costs. 71 On June 17th, Mrs. Polly Spielsinger, of 11, Mile End Road, was summoned for causing obstruction in a bakehouse to the siezure of the above unsound eggs. She was fined £3, with 2s. costs. On June 17th, Mr. Harry Spielsinger, of 11, Mile End Road, was summoned for causing a similar obstruction. He was fined £3, with 2s. costs. On October 27th, five bullocks heads were examined in a shop at 153, Salmon Lane. Two were found to be tuberculous. The owner, Mr. Philo, was cautioned. On November 10th, another visit was made to the premises when three bullocks heads were found to have tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands. In one case, the gland was four times its normal size and had a slight cut made into it, This gland was so obviously diseased that a mere superficial examination would have revealed its condition. The meat was condemned by the Magistrate and Mr. Philo was on December 15th fined £8, with £2 4s. costs for depositing them for sale. On November 3rd, Mr. Albert Moody, of 141, Salmon's Lane, Limehouse, was summoned for having deposited on his premises a quantity of diseased meat weighing 55 stone. Mr. Moody's two sons Claude and Frank, were also summoned for aiding and abetting. The case against Mr. Claude Moody was dismissed. Mr. Albert Moody was fined £5 with £4 4s. costs, and Mr. Frank Moody, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to two months' imprisonment without the option of a fine. Although he had made a written statement on September 19th that it was his brother Claude who had brought the meat to the premises, he on oath stated, that this was not true, and that he himself had brought the meat to the shop. Mr. Frank Moody appealed against the sentence, but at the Sessions on January 8th, 1915, the appeal was dismissed with costs against the Appellant. On December 14th, the carcases of four sheep were seized at 138, White Horse Street. They were dropsical and emaciated, and quite unfit for human consumption. Proceedings were taken against Mr. Jacob Goldstein, the owner of the premises, for having the meat deposited for the purpose of sale, and on January 5th, 1915, he was fined £5, and £2 6s. costs. On the same day Mr. Louis Frankel, of 2, Whitechapel High Street, was summoned for having sold the meat to Mr. Goldstein, knowing, or having reason to believe, that the meat was unsound at the time of sale. He was fined £5 with £2 4s. costs. Sale of Horseflesh. On January 24th the meat in a butcher's shop at 160, White Horse Street, belonging to a Mr. Claude Moody, was inspected. In an ice safe at the rear of the shop a quantity of horseflesh was found. I cautioned Mr. Moody as to any statement he might wish to make. He admitted that he had bought the meat from a man who was a licensed horse slaughterer. The meat was a portion of the carcase of a horse, 72 and it weighed nearly 2 cwts. There were also some bones with some meat attached, which belonged to the carcase of another horse, as well as a diseased liver. These were found in a bedroom at the top of the premises. The meat was seized and taken before a Magistrate, for an order to have the stuff condemned, but Mr. Moody objected, and applied to have the meat returned to him. The Magistrate thereupon directed that a Summons should be forthwith issued against him, and made returnable later in the day. In the afternoon the solicitor for the defendant admitted that the meat seized was horseflesh, but denied that the horseflesh was used in his business. He admitted that the defendant had lent himself as a medium for the reception of horseflesh, which was utilised by other persons. The Magistrate said it was quite clear the horseflesh was deposited for the purpose of sale, and fined the defendant £20, with £2 4s. costs. The preparation of Food, Clothing, &c., for the Army and Navy. There are many firms in the Borough which prepare food for the troops. The work of these firms was kept under supervision by officers of the Public Health Department. I can with confidence state that the food has always been of the best quality, and great care has been exercised by the firms concerned both in the selection of the foods and their preparation. The foods are of various kinds. Three firms have been, and still are, engaged in the manufacture of jam and marmalade, and about 250,000 lbs. were prepared weekly. One of these three firms prepared in addition about 40,000 tins a week of meat and vegetable rations, each tin containing 12 ozs. of meat, 5 ozs. of potatoes, 1 oz. of carrots, 1 oz. of onions, 1 oz. of haricot beans and 2 ozs. of gravy. They are sent out to France ready cooked but the contents can be warmed up in the tins. Three firms are engaged in making about 220 tons of biscuits weekly. Three firms are engaged in curing and packing bacon to the extent of 2,050 boxes a week, and as each box weighs at least 60 lbs., 50 to 60 tons of bacon have been prepared in this district every week. A great deal of food is imported through the wharves in the Borough and two firms have imported weekly for the troops about 5,000 cases of tinned beef, weighing 116 tons. Other firms have been employed to a lesser extent supplying butter, tinned salmon, eggs, tomatoes, &c. A large number of persons were also engaged in the Borough in the manufacture of khaki clothing for the soldiers, 16,518 being employed in factories and workshops and 395 as home-workers. Home-workers were also employed on other articles of military equipment. 73 When the war broke out, very little work was being done by out-workers during the first week in August, but this is not unusual after a Bank Holiday. Towards the end of August, persons employed on khaki clothing, soldiers' caps and shirts became exceedingly busy. All kinds of workshops were converted into premises for the manufacture of clothing for soldiers. The list of outworkers is supplied twice a year, during the first week in August and February. The August lists had been returned before the outworkers became busy, and for that reason the lists were very incomplete. About this time the Scarlet Fever epidemic started, and great care was exercised in preventing the distribution of military clothing that had been exposed to infection. Several cases occurred in outworkers' premises, but the clothes were all disinfected before they were returned to the contractors. New factories and workshops for the manufacture of khaki clothing were started, and other workshops were converted for the purpose of making the necessary clothing for the army. Premises engaged in making underclothing, ladies mantles and costumes as well as ordinary tailoring workshops were immediately adapted for the purpose. In one instance, a walking-stick manufacturer suddenly gave up his trade, and a week afterwards, was employing a dozen people in making khaki clothing. In another case, a refreshment contractor for weddings, gave up his ordinary business, and converted his premises into a khaki clothing factory. In addition to this, a large trade was done in the district and a large number of men were employed in the manufacture of military kitbags, caps, packing and ammunition cases, tents and tarpauling, timber for huts, haversacks, nosebags, horse pegs, saddlery and other leather accoutrements, cartridge belts, brushes for sweeping the trenches, brass caps for searchlights, beds, bed clothing, &c., as well as life-buoys and kapok floats for mine-sweeping. Knapsacks and haversacks were also manufactured for the French Government, about 70 persons being employed. The result has been a great demand for workshops, work has been plentiful, and unemployment has been conspicuous by its absence. In fact, it is almost an exception to find a factory or workshop that is not working directly or indirectly for the War Office or Admiralty. General Sanitary Work. In the Sanitary Inspectors' Report table will be found the record of the work carried out by each Inspector during the year, together with its nature. 45,298 houses were inspected, 4,420 being the result of house to house visitation. 13,206 intimation notices were served for the abatement of various nuisances as well as 6,665 statutory notices. 74 61,941 visits were made to supervise the abatement of the nuisances complained of. Police Court proceedings were taken in 44 instances where statutory notices were not complied with.

For years before 1911 some of the corrections as to transferable deaths probably will not be available. The Rates should be calculated per 1,000 of the estimated gross population as stated in Col. 2, without the use of the standardising factor for the district given in the Annual Report of the Registrar-General. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. *In Column 6 arc to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9.
