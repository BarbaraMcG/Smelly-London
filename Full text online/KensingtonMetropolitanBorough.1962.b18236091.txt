Zibray AC 4348 KEN 71 The Royal Borough of Kensington ANNUAL REPORT of the Health of the Borough FOR THE YEAR 1962 BY J. H. WEIR M.D.. B.S.. B.HY.. D.P.H MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH THE ROYAL BOROUGH OF KENSINGTON Telephone: WEStern 3173 Public Health Department, Hornton Street, Kensington, W.8. 1st June, 1963 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Royal Borough of Kensington. My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting the Annual Report on the state of the public health in Kensington for 1962. The Minister of Health has again requested (Circular 1/63) that the Report should be generally in the same form as has been the case for some years past. The public health in Kensington during the year under review was maintained at a satisfactory standard. Population. The population of the borough as finally ascertained by the Census in 1961 was 171,272. For the purpose of this report, the population for 1962 has been estimated by the RegistrarGeneral to be 172,020. The estimated population figure for the previous year was 169,080. Birth Rate. The number of live births per 1,000 population of the borough was 19.7 in 1962 which compares with the figure of 19.5 for the previous year. Death Rate. The number of deaths per 1,000 population in 1962 was 10.21, slightly lower than the death rate for the previous year (l0.24). Area Comparability Factors for Birth and Death Rates. Comparisons of crude birth and death rates between local areas are not strictly valid since these rates take no account of the varying composition of the populations of the different areas by sex and age. In order to compare Kensington birth and death rates with England and Wales as a whole, the Registrar-General has, in the case of death rates since 1934, and in the case of birth rates since 1949, supplied area comparability factors (A.C.Fs.). This is considered to be necessary as the proportion of old people to young, and of males to females, varies considerably in different districts. The local crude death rates are affected as the mortality at the extremes of life is much greater than in the middle period, and at practically all ages the mortality in females is rather less than in males of corresponding ages. Similarly, so far as the local birth rates are concerned, the child bearing component of the population varies in different districts. In a borough such as Kensington, which has a higher proportion of females amongst its inhabitants compared with most other districts, the crude birth and death rates cannot be compared satisfactorily with those of, say, an industrial area, where the proportion of males is much higher. The Registrar-General has supplied, for use in Kensington in 1962, the figures 0.72 for births and 1.00 for deaths. The crude birth and death rates for the borough should be multiplied by the appropriate factor, and when so adjusted the results are comparable - 2 - with the crude rates for England and Wales or with the corresponding adjusted rates for any other area. The following table gives the adjusted Kensington birth and death rates compared with the provisional rates for London and for England and Wales for the year 1962:- Kensington adjusted London England and Wales No. of births per 1,000 population 14.18 19.6 18.0 No. of deaths per 1,000 population 10.21 12.0 11.9 Infant Death Rate. This rate for 1962 was 22.4, an increase compared with the rate for the previous year of 20.9. The provisional rate for the County of London was 21.l and for England and Wales was 21.4. The following table shows the rates for the last five years:- Year Kensington London England and Wales 1962 22.4 21.l 21.4 1961 20.9 21.5 21.6 I960 20.8 21.6 21.9 1959 24.8 22.3 22.2 1958 22.7 22.6 22.6 Variations in the infant mortality rate are contributed to partly by perinatal mortality, i.e. stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life, prematurity (see table below) and the statistical difficulties arising from the small numbers involved. Just over two deaths suffice to increase the rate by one. Year Number of deaths of babies under one week of age Age in days at death 1 or under 2 3 4 5 6 Total No. of deaths due to prematurity 1958 37 5 3 2 2 1 50 29 1959 34 3 5 4 3 3 52 38 1960 27 4 - 4 - 2 37 22 1961 30 6 - 3 - 1 40 21 1962 36 4 1 - 1 4 46 19 1962 1961 Neo-natal mortality rate (i.e. deaths of infants under 4 weeks per 1,000 total live births) 15.32 13.66 Early neo-natal mortality rate (i.e. deaths of infants under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) 13.55 12.14 Perinatal mortality rate (i.e. stillbirths and deaths of infants under 1 week per 1,000 total live and still births) 30.96 28.36 - 3 - Maternal Death Rate. One death of a mother due to child-birth was recorded in 1962, giving a maternal death rate per 1,000 live and still births of 0.29. (The provisional maternal mortality rate for the County of London was 0.52 and for England and Wales the figure was 0.35) Infectious Diseases. There was no serious outbreak of infectious disease in the borough during 1962. The total number of notifications received was 714 in comparison with 2,150 in 1961. The difference is almost entirely due to the decrease in the number of cases of measles notified in 1962 compared with the previous year. Tuberculosis. The death rate from all forms of tuberculosis per 100,000 population was 7.0 which was lower than last year by 3.05. The 1962 Kensington death rate compares with the rate (provisional) of 6.6 for England and Wales. Lung Disease. Kensington's death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis per 100,000 population decreased in 1962 compared with the previous year, but the death rate for cancer of the lung showed a slight increase. Comparative figures for England and Wales showed a decrease in the rate in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis, but a continuing increase in the death rate for lung cancer. The following table shows the trend in these diseases since the end of the war:- Year England and Wales Kensington Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the Lung Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the Lung Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate 1949 17,471 40.5 10,975 25.5 56 32.0 50 28.7 1950 14,079 32.1 12,241 28.0 52 29.0 70 39.4 1951 12,031 27.5 13,247 30.2 36 17.5 70 40.9 1952 9,335 21.2 14,218 32.3 29 16.8 71 41.1 1953 7,913 17.9 15,132 34.3 26 15.1 65 37.9 1954 7,069 16.0 16,331 36.9 20 11.7 72 42.2 1955 5,838 13.1 17,271 38.9 12 7.1 73 43.1 1956 4,851 10.9 18,185 40.7 19 11.2 73 43.2 1957 4,250 9.5 19,118 42.6 13 7.7 90 53.6 1958 4,000 8.9 19,809 43.9 10 6.0 79 47.7 1959 3,475 7.7 21,063 46.4 9 5.4 75 45.0 1960 3,094 6.8 21,992 48.1 11 6.6 94 56.0 1961 3,001 6.5 22,809 49.4 16 9.45 71 42.0 1962 2,776 5.9 23,779 51.0 11 6.4 75 43.6 (Death rates quoted above are per 100,000 population) Housing. The housing problem in Kensington is sharply divided into two separate needs. Foremost is the need to clear those parts of the borough where the houses are practically worn out and the only satisfactory method is to demolish them. The second need is to preserve those houses which, although nearing the end of their useful life, can be with suitable works of repair and adaptation used for housing for, say, another 20 years. In Kensington the houses for clearance are mainly centered in the two areas known as Kensal New Town and Blechynden Street which with its southern extension is now referred to as the Lancaster Road West area. These two areas will constitute the main clearance operations in the borough for some years to come. The Council have reached an agreement with the London County Council as to the division of responsibility in both these areas. In Kensal New Town the London County Council have undertaken the redevelopment of about seven acres of old property east of Golborne Road. They have also undertaken the development of about eight acres of that part of Blechynden Street area north of the railway line. - 4 - Improvement and. repair of individual houses are being undertaken by the Council under the Housing Act, 1961, which deals with houses in multiple occupation. The Act provides ideal legislation for dealing with certain properties in Kensington which, because of their age and design, are not suitable for conversion into self-contained flats. However, with additional amenities such as water closets, baths and hot water, they would provide reasonable accommodation at reasonable rents. The Council have decided upon a short term policy of prestervation of this type of property. A systematic application of the Housing Act, 1961 has already commenced in parts of the Golborne Ward. The Council have decided to augment the staff by the appointment of technical assistants and clerical staff, as and when suitable office accommodation can be provided. The results of this work will be watched with interest, and indeed the Minister of Housing and Local Government has intimated that he will ask for a report on the experience gained in the next two years. Clean Air Act. During the year, the Council's original programme of the declaration of Smoke Control Areas in the borough was reviewed at the request of the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The Council have decided to speed up the programme by aiming to complete it in 1970 instead of 1973. Progress in this work was satisfactorily maintained. An additional area, the Norland Ward No.l area, was made the subject of a Smoke Control Order during the year. The detailed survey of a second area, the Norland Ward No.2 area, was authorised by the Council and it is anticipated that the Order will be made in 1963. The Council's programme is being dealt with in accordance with the scheduled times. Apart from the five isolated objections received in respect of the Holland Ward No.2 area, which resulted in a twelve months' delay, the residents of Kensington, both owners and occupiers, appear to be welcoming the Council's efforts to reduce atmospheric pollution. The work is of a detailed nature and necessitates numerous inspections to ensure that contraventions of the Clean Air Act will not occur, but generally speaking, the initial difficulties in operating this legislation have been overcome and there is no reason why the work should not proceed quickly and smoothly to its finality. Food Hygiene. The standard of hygiene in food shops throughout the borough was generally maintained at a high level. During the year 1,809 inspections were carried out and it was found necessary to serve thirteen informal notices. Unfortunately, the Council's Inspectors still discover flagrant cases of non-observance of the Food hygiene Regulations and as a result the number of prosecutions increased compared with the previous year. These legal proceedings were taken mainly in cases of unsatisfactory conditions found in restaurants rather than retail food shops. It would appear that the urgency of the need to prepare meals for consumption on the premises, detracts from the sense of responsibility to maintain clean conditions. In some cases the operation of the Licensing Act, 1961 has had an indirect benefit in improving food hygiene in clubs and restaurants coming within the jurisdiction of this Act. In a number of cases the Council have been able to secure an improvement of the sanitary conditions of clubs and restaurants by indicating that existing conditions would necessitate an objection to the granting of licences by the Justices. Hospital Plan. During the year the Council gave consideration to the Minister of Health's Hospital Plan for England and Wales, in which he formulated a comprehensive scheme for the re-organisation of the hospital system during the next fifteen years. The effect of the proposals in the West London area (particularly Kensington and Chelsea), received the careful consideration of the Public Health - 5 - Committee, who were not satisfied that the proposals were in the best interests of the two boroughs. The Committee reported to the Council that, so far as Kensington was concerned, the Minister's plan did not fulfil the proposed aim to place the most modern treatment at the service of patients and enable the staffs who care for them to exercise their skill and devotion under the best conditions. The Council were particularly anxious that a District General Hospital should be established at St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Marloes Road. On 29th May, 1962, the Council resolved to send a deputation to the Minister of Health, who replied stating that the planning of the local hospital services was a matter for the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. He asked the Council to discuss their views with the Board in the first instance. The Regional Hospital Board received a deputation from the Council on 12th December, 1962, when the Board's representatives agreed to issue a statement on their proposals for the area. The Chairman of the Board stated that it was hoped to keep St. Mary Abbots Hospital as a General Hospital, in conjunction with St. Stephen's Hospital. The development of the Hospital Plan is being kept under constant review to ensure that the interests of Kensington inhabitants are fully protected. CENSUS. 1961 The Registrar-General has published a Census report on the County of London in respect of the population enumerated as at midnight, 23rd/24th April, 1961. The census population comprises those residents of the area who were at home, but not those who were away on census night, whether of British or non-British nationality. Visitors from other areas in the United Kingdom and also from abroad (including members of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth or foreign countries, except those aboard foreign naval vessels) are included. Persons enumerated aboard vessels which on census night were at moorings or anchorage in England and Wales, or were engaged in coastwise or fishing voyages, have been included and classified, with as much accuracy as the information furnished allows, to the appropriate local areas of their anchorage or mooring, or, if actually in transit on census night, to their next port or place of call. Persons travelling during the night or who were otherwise inaccessible were counted as part of the population of the area where they arrived the next day, unless they had been previously enumerated. The population enumerated as described above excludes, in particular, members of the Armed Forces and Mercantile Marine outside England and Wales, and in this respect omits a number of persons who might otherwise have been in the area. The Registrar-General gives the population for the borough and the various wards as set out in the following table:- - 6 - 1931 1951 1961 Total Persons Total Persons Total Persons Males Females KENSINGTON 180,667 168,160 171,272 76,361 94,911 Wards:- Golborne 23,682 14,493 14,522 7,308 7,214 St. Charles 28,991 25,835 25,543 12,309 13,234 Pembridge 20,425 18,947 20,153 9,410 10,743 Norland 21,620 16,672 16,893 7,968 8,925 NORTH KENSINGTON 94,718 75,947 77,111 36,995 40,116 Holland 18,981 20,537 20,930 8,553 12,377 Earls Court 18,405 20,603 21,289 9,045 12,244 Queen's Gate 14,486 14,173 14,903 6,040 8,863 Redcliffe 21,527 23,815 23,806 10,076 13,730 Brompton 12,560 13,085 13,233 5,652 7,581 SOUTH KENSINGTON 85,959 92,213 94,161 39,366 54,795 LONDON 4,397,003 3,347,956 3,200,484 1,524,359 1,676,125 The Census revealed the number of persons per acre in the various wards of the borough and the density of room-occupation as follows:- Area Acreage Persons per acre Density of occupation Persons per room Percentage of persons at more than 1½ per room LONDON 74,898 42.7 0.77 11.5 KENSINGTON 2,291 74.7 0.80 18.5 Golborne 113 128.5 1.17 40.5 St. Charles 403 63.4 0.94 23.2 Pembridge 193 104.4 0.88 21.6 Norland 195 86.6 0.90 20.4 Holland 484 43.2 0.65 8.2 Earls Court 243 87.6 0.78 18.4 Queen's Gate 173 86.1 0.62 6.7 Redcliffe 270 88.2 0.74 12.9 Brompton 217 61.0 0.63 9.4 - 7 - The following table shows birthplaces and nationalities of the population in Kensington as revealed by the Census:- Males Females Total British Isles 55,256 70,392 125,648 England 45,406 57,262 102,668 Wales 1,557 2,297 3,854 Scotland 2,334 3,076 5,310 Northern Ireland 742 904 1,646 United Kingdom (part not stated) 288 338 626 Irish Republic 4,489 5,889 10,378 Ireland (part not stated) 342 476 818 Isle of Man 19 29 48 Channel Islands 79 121 200 Total born outside the British Isles: Resident in England and Wales 18,272 20,802 39,074 Visitors 2,193 2,896 5,089 Commonwealth Countries Resident in England and Wales 6,184 6,710 12,894 Visitors 832 1,154 1,986 Colonies, Protectorates, etc. Resident in England and Wales 3,798 3,040 6,838 Visitors 106 139 245 Foreign Countries and at Sea Resident in England and Wales 8,290 11,052 19,342 Visitors 1,255 1,603 2,858 Birthplace not stated Resident in England and Wales 616 780 1,396 Visitors 24 41 65 * Nationality and Citizenship of Residents born outside the British Isles 18,272 20,802 39,074 U.K. and Colonies by birth or descent 5,543 5,753 11,296 U.K. and Colonies by registration or marriage 312 1,700 2,012 U.K. and Colonies by naturalisation 1,451 1,343 2,794 U.K. and Colonies, mode of acquisition not stated 538 714 1,252 Other Commonwealth (and Irish) 3,991 3,622 7,613 Aliens (including Stateless) 5,660 6,719 12,379 Not stated 777 951 1,728 76,361 94,911 171,272 * British subjects not stating a citizenship have been included with citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. - 8 - The following table shows the household domestic arrangements in regard to ordinary domestic sanitary conveniences, showing the numbers of households with or without these conveniences or sharing them.

The line of demarcation formed by Holland Park Avenue, Notting Hill Gate, and the Bayswater Road divides the borough into approximately equal halves described in previous years and in this report as North and South Kensington respectively. The borough is further sub-divided into nine wards. North Kensington includes the wards of St. Charles, Golborne, Norland and Pembridge, whilst South Kensington is made up of the five other wards, namely, Holland, Earl's Court, Queen's Gate, Redcliffe and Brompton. The population of the borough as ascertained at the census in 1961 was 171,272 persons. For the purpose of this report, the population for 1962 has been estimated by the Registrar-General to be 172,020.

In most cases houses are connected direct to borough council sewers, and these in turn discharge into the London County Council main sewers. In a few cases, where local sewers do not exist, house connections are taken direct into the main sewers. WATER SUPPLY The water supply in Kensington is almost entirely provided by the Metropolitan Water Board, but there are two premises which obtain water from artesian and deep wells. Samples of water were taken both by the Council and the owners for bacteriological and chemical examination. Results showed that the waters were suitable for drinking and other domestic purposes. BACTERIOLOGICAL AND ANALYTICAL WORK The following is a summary of the work performed during 1962:- Nature of specimen or sample Number examined Nose and throat swabs 146 Faeces and rectal swabs 969 Milk (bacteriological) 69 Water (drinking) 6 Water (swimming baths) 8 Ice Cream 15 Miscellaneous 24 COMBINED DISINFECTING STATION AND MEDICINAL BATHS The disinfecting station at Wood Lane was built and equipped in 1906. In 1940 the station was severely damaged by enemy action, when practically the whole of one side of the building was destroyed. The other side also received severe damage, so much so that if it were to remain on its existing site, there was no doubt that the greater part of the building would have to be demolished to its foundation and rebuilt. In view of this, only "first aid" and temporary repairs, with a minimum of decoration, have been undertaken during the past twenty years. In 1961, the Council approved a scheme to combine the disinfecting station and the medicinal baths on the site of the latter, which adjoins the public baths in Lancaster Road. A single-storey building with vehicular access from Blechynden Mews, and pedestrian access both for the staff and the public on the Silchester Road frontage, will be provided at a cost of approximately £37,000. and the new building will be in use in 1963. Work at the Kensington Medicinal Baths, Blechynden News, proceeded normally until 12th May, 1962, when the building was closed for demolition so that the new combined disinfecting station and medicinal baths could be built on the site. By agreement with Hammersmith Borough Council the work of cleansing verminous persons - 15 - was temporarily transferred, to the Hammersmith Medicinal Baths in Scotts Road, Shepherds Bush, W.12. The London County Council made their own arrangements for the cleansing of school-children at the Hammersmith Baths, but the agreement between this Council and Hammersmith Borough Council provided for the treatments to be carried out at a cost of 12/6d. per cleansing. Medicinal Baths (Personal Cleansing Station) The following table shows the work carried out during 1962 at both the Kensington and the Hammersmith Medicinal Baths:- Description Scabies Vermin Impetigo Persons Cleansings Persons Cleansings Persons Cleansings Adults Kensington 59 106 80 84 — — Other boroughs 2 3 19 19 — — School-children Kensington 17 49 52 52 1 3 Other boroughs 7 20 59 59 — — Children under 5 Kensington 11 19 12 12 — — Other boroughs — — — — — — TOTALS 96 197 222 226 1 3 In addition to the cleansing of persons referred to above, articles of personal clothing disinfested at the Medicinal Baths during the year numbered 425 Disinfection and disinfestation A summary of the routine work carried out in 1962 by the disinfecting staff is shown in the following table:- - 16 - Houses disinfected, after infectious disease 118 (191 rooms) Houses disinfested after vermin 277 (530 rooms) Total weight of bedding, etc. dealt with:Tons cwt. qtr. lb. 6 19 3 5 It is the practice of certain foreign countries to prohibit the import of parcels of clothing, unless accompanied with a certificate that the articles have been disinfected. The Council afford facilities to persons desirous of sending clothing abroad, but make a charge of 2/6d. for each certificate provided. During the year, 132 parcels of clothing were disinfected and the income amounted to £16.10s. Od. The following table indicates the destination of these parcels:- No. of parcels Czechoslovakia 45 Spain 62 Rumania 9 East Germany 15 Australia 1 TOTAL 132 Some other countries allow the import of clothing if accompanied by a certificate stating that no case of infectious disease has occurred at the sender's address within twenty-one days prior to mailing. During the year 3 such certificates were issued. H.C.N. (hydrogen cyanide) Disinfestation With the manufacture and sale for general use of effective insecticides such as D.D.T., there has been a considerable reduction in the number of bug-infested houses in the borough. The Council have, therefore, discontinued their policy of treating with H.C.N. the furniture of all incoming tenants of new flats, irrespective of whether there was evidence of infestation or not. The Council's Chief Housing Officer notifies the Medical Officer of Health, in advance, of the names and addresses of prospective tenants, and inspections of the furniture and effects at the old homes are made by a public health inspector. If infestation is found, the contents of the home are disinfested before being taken to the new flat. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, imposes a duty on occupiers of premises to notify the Council of rodent infestation, and the Council are required to ensure that the borough is, as far as practicable, kept free from rats and mice. The Council deal with rat and mice infestation in dwelling houses without cost to the occupiers, but expenditure incurred in treating infestations on commercial and industrial premises is recovered from the owners. The Council are required to submit reports on (i) the extent of infestation, (ii) special circumstances to which any undue presence of rats and mice might be attributed, and (iii) the nature and extent of co-operative working with contiguous local authorities. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food requested a report for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1962 in the following form:- - 17 - Prevalence of Rats and Mice Type of Property Total Local Authority Dwelling Houses All other (including Business & Industrial) I.

Total treatments carried out - including re-treatments 13 804 83 900 - 18 - For a number of years, all the sewers in the borough have been treated with poison bait, to destroy rats, twice yearly. This work had, up to 1957, been carried out in January and June each year, coinciding with similar treatments carried out in neighbouring boroughs. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommended in 1957 that a new system of treatment should be introduced, which involved changing the times of baiting to April and September each year, allowing a longer period of time during which baits were left in the sewers, and mixing a mould inhibitor (paranitrophenol) with the baiting material to act as a preservative. The following table shows the results obtained during the year, compared with the results obtained in the previous six years:- Year Estimated number of rats killed 1st Treatment 2nd Treatment 1956 4,764 4,138 1957 4,476 (January) 7,751 (April) 7,044 (September) 1958 4,945 6,617 1959 6,211 8,082 1960 10,414 5,416 1961 4,243 3,002 1962 2,387 2,345 The rodent staff deal with infestations from pests other than rats and mice, and the following is a summary of all action taken during the years:- Premises inspected following complaints 844 Premises where rats were found 254 Premises where mice were found 550 Premises where other vermin were found 156 Premises where no infestation existed 4 Number of visits made 4,678 Number of successful treatments 1,005 Cases in which advice only was given 52 Borough Council properties dealt with 22 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT. 1933 At the end of the year the number of sellers of Part II Poisons (other than registered pharmacists) on the list maintained by the Council was 123. Of this number 7 were new registrations during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 This Act regulates the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Subject to certain exceptions, the Act makes it unlawful to use prescribed filling materials except on premises registered by a local authority. The exceptions are in the remaking and reconditioning of any article or upholstering in connection with the making of railway carriages, road vehicles, ships or aircraft. The local authority are required, on the application of the occupier of premises, to register the premises on payment of a registration fee of One Pound. At the end of the year, there were 19 registered premises in the borough. The Act further provides that no rag flock shall be delivered to registered premises except from premises licensed for manufacturing rag flock or used as a store for rag flock. A - 19 - local authority on receiving from the occupier of premises an application for the grant or renewal of an annual licence authorising him to manufacture rag flock or to use his premises as a rag flock store, may grant or renew the licence on payment of a fee of One Pound. No licences have been issued in Kensington. If on registered premises there are unclean filling materials, the occupier shall be guilty of an offence; and it is also an offence to sell or offer for sale any article which is upholstered with unclean filling materials (second-hand articles are excepted). Inspections of the registered premises were made during the year, and 4 samples of rag flock and other fillings were taken for analysis. The results were satisfactory. Description No. of samples Algerian Fibre 1 Cotton Felt 3 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act requires that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence issued by the Council and in compliance with any conditions specified in the licence. During the year, 9 premises were licensed under the Act. The general conditions for pet shops approved by the Council are those recommended for their constituent councils by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. HEALTH EDUCATION Health education is an important activity and forms an integral part of the National Health Service. For many years the Council have made an annual grant to the Central Council for Health Education, which is the body recognised by the Minister of Health as the medium through which health education material is distributed throughout England and Wales. For the year 1962/63, the Council made a grant of £23. 0s. 0d. Posters, leaflets and other material (including copies of "Better Health") were obtained from the Central Council for distribution in Kensington. Posters dealing with a variety of health topics were displayed at regular intervals during the year on the poster boards available throughout the borough and in the public health department. Leaflets on many subjects were made available to the public through the department. Smoking and Health In March, 1962, the Royal College of Physicians published a report on "Smoking and Health." This report assessed the evidence about the relationship of smoking and health and, inter alia, - 20 - stated "Cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and bronchitis, and probably contributes to the development of coronary heart disease and various less common diseases," One of the principal recommendations was that there should be more education of the public, and especially schoolchildren, concerning the hazards of smoking. On 12th March, 1962, the Ministry of Health issued Circular 6/62 in which reference was made to this report, and Councils were asked to take immediate steps to achieve a general discouragement of smoking. The Circular stated "the Minister considers that health education should increasingly emphasise the hazards of smoking. He accordingly asked Councils to use all their channels of health education to make the conclusions of the Report widely known, and to bring home to the public the dangers to health of smoking, particularly of cigarettes." The Ministry of Health published a series of posters, copies of which were obtained and exhibited on the poster boards in the borough The London County Council, as the education authority, were concerned with young people and were taking anti-smoking propaganda measures. This Council agreed to co-operate in any anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the County Council and steps were taken to arrange health education measures in March, 1963. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. 1961 This Act empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations imposing, in respect of any prescribed class of goods, requirements to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury. The Oil Heaters Regulations, 1962, came into force on 1st June, 1962, and prescribe certain standards of construction, design and performance with which all unflued domestic oil heaters must comply. It is an offence to sell any oil heater after that date which does not comply with the Regulations. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations, 1953, continue to operate and make it an offence to sell any gas or electric fire, or oil heater, suitable for use in residential premises, unless it is fitted with an adequate guard- Generally speaking, traders do not commit offences under these Regulations., but it is necessary to keep a careful watch on the sale of second-hand appliances from stalls in public markets. HOME SAFETY The Home Safety Act, 1961, empowers local authorities to make arrangements for the dissemination of information and advice relating to the prevention of accidents in the home, and activities under this heading are combined with the work of health education. The majority of home accidents, when analysed, show clearly that human ignorance and carelessness were basic causes. The prevention of home accidents depends on an individual having the necessary knowledge for his or her personal and domestic safety. In November, the Council supported the "Home Safety Training Year" campaign of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the object of which was to reduce the number of home accidents through the knowledge and skill which come from practical training. Posters, leaflets and information were sent to youth clubs, old people's clubs, large business and industrial concerns, voluntary - 21 - organisations, etc. in the borough. Suitable posters were displayed on the department's notice boards in the borough. Accidents in the home The London County Council, as the ambulance authority, have been keeping records of home accident cases (both fatal and non-fatal) removed to hospital by them. The Medical Officer for the County Council has kindly supplied me with the following figures for 1962. It has not been possible to give details of cases by cause in age and sex groups. The figures relate to Health Division 1, of which Kensington forms a part together with Chelsea, Fulham and Hammersmith. Cause of accident Division 1 London County Fall - On stairs 154 998 Prom ladder 5 101 Prom chair 19 149 Outside 26 198 In garden 9 219 In bath 4 23 From one level to another 56 434 On same level 75 751 Unspecified 504 3,692 Hit by object 28 221 Cooking stove 17 136 Teapots 3 53 Other boiling water 23 179 Electric shock - 22 Poisoning 48 340 Gassing 37 192 Knife-like wounds 42 326 Fires 26 185 Windows 4 29 Suffocation 10 31 Not specified 38 328 Total: 1,128 8,607 The distribution of the cases in Division 1 is shown in the following table:- Borough Population (1962) Number of Accidents Rate per 10,000 Kensington 172,020 445 25.9 Fulham 111,500 309 27.7 Chelsea 48,550 91 18.7 Hammersmith 108,120 283 26.2 Division 1 440,290 1,128 25.6 County of London 3,186,000 8,607 27.0 - 22 - MASS RADIOGRAPHY Mass radiography is undertaken on behalf of the Minister of Health by the Regional Hospital Boards. Kensington is included in the area covered by the Mass X-ray Unit No. 5Aoperated by the Northwest Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board from 285, Harrow Road, W.9. The purpose of mass radiography is twofold:- (i) to find abnormalities of the chest and in particular tuberculosis and cancer of the lungs, and (ii) to give those whose X-ray is within "normal limit" a certain degree of security. The number of persons X-rayed by the Unit during a survey held in Kensington during the year was 213, and a provisional analysis of the results revealed no abnormalities. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Smoke Control Areas. Sections 11 to 15 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, relate to the functions of the Council to declare smoke control areas, in which the emission of smoke from the chimney of any building (not exempted under the Order) would be an offence. The procedure for establishing a smoke control area has been prescribed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, who has stated that now considerable experience has been gained, there is no longer a need for provisional proposals to be submitted. The following is the programme of smoke control areas adopted by the Council with the object of securing that the whole of Kensington is controlled by 1970. The map of the borough following page 21 indicates the various areas. - 23 - Smoke Control Area Boundaries Detailed Survey & Order Made Order operative Holland Ward (No.l) N. Holland Park Avenue S.

It has an area of about 100 acres and contains 2909 buildings. Prom the detailed survey it was estimated that the total cost of adaptations would be about £21,992. The Minister of Housing and Local Government had requested local authorities to exempt from smoke control orders, buildings, or separately occupied parts of buildings, not supplied with town gas, subject to the condition that the exemption would have effect only where authorised fuels or kindling sticks and paper were used. The Council accordingly resolved that the fireplaces in the area as specified in the following table should be exempt from the operation of Section 11 of the Clean Air Act. Description Fireplaces in buildings, or parts of buildings, separately occupied, without gas supply. Conditions Only authorised fuels, as declared by Regulations under the Clean Air Act, 1956, and kindling sticks and paper shall be used in the fireplaces. The Norland Ward (No.l) Smoke Control Order was confirmed by the Minister without modification and will operate from 1st October, 1963. The Council also decided to deal with the Norland Ward (No.2) area, which is bounded on the north by the middle of Lancaster Road, on the east by the middle of Walmer Road and Princedale Road, and on the south by the middle of Holland Park Avenue, and on the west by the borough boundary. It has an area of about 95 acres. New furnaces. Section 3 requires that new furnaces, not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a specified capacity, shall be so far as is practicable smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for approval before the work of installation takes place. During 1962, 5 notifications were received, and one application for approval of plans, etc. was approved. In one instance it was reported that a new furnace had been installed in a building without proper notice being given to the Council, and the Public Health Committee decided to issue a warning in this case. Smoke emissions. The Sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956 which relate to industrial smoke came into force on 1st June, 1958. Up to that date emissions of industrial smoke were dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions mainly affecting the Council are contained in Section 1, which prohibits the emission of dark smoke (except for certain periods laid down by regulation) and Section 16 which deals with smoke nuisances. - 26 - During the year 47 complaints of smoke nuisance were received and 24 formal smoke observations were carried out. Remedial measures in all cases were secured without further proceedings. Routine measurement of atmospheric pollution. The Council maintain two atmospheric pollution measuring stations as follows (1) North Kensington (St. Joseph's Convent, Portobello Road) (2) South Kensington (Messrs. John Barker's Furniture Depository, Pembroke Road). The apparatus at each station consists of a standard deposit gauge for collecting soluble and insoluble deposits, and a lead peroxide apparatus for measuring the sulphur content of the air. Readings are taken at each station at the end of each month. In addition to the above mentioned stations, the Council have established three smoke measuring stations as follows (1) Public Health Department, Hornton Street, W.8. (2) Public Library, Ladbroke Grove, W.10. (3) L.C.C. Child Welfare Centre, Redcliffe Street, S.W.10. The equipment at the Public Health Department consists of a smoke filter and a hydrogen peroxide bubbling apparatus. The smoke filter measures the daily concentration of smoke suspended in the atmosphere, and the hydrogen peroxide bubbler extracts the sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere. Readings are taken each day, and the results are averaged to produce figures for each calendar month. The equipment at the Public Library and the Welfare Centre consists of smoke filters only. Measurements are taken three times a week, and daily and monthly averages are calculated from the results. The following tables set out details of the results obtained in Kensington during 1962:- * The operation of these two measuring stations was discontinued as from 1st January, 1963, and the apparatus was dismantled. 27 A.

General observations. Whilst it is too early to assess whether the atmosphere in Kensington is generally better as a result of the Council's efforts in promoting smoke control areas, it is certainly gratifying to see from the above figures that in the last eight years the measurement of deposited matter in tons per square mile on a monthly average basis has been reduced, in the case of North Kensington from 18.98 to 9.97, and in the case of South Kensington from 15.98 to 7.80. There are, of course, other factors to take into consideration and it is unwise to express opinions on figures obtained locally in comparatively small areas. - 29 - The work undertaken by the Public Health Department is a small part of that taking place throughout the country, and all results obtained in Kensington are forwarded to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for correlation with results obtained in all other districts. In this connection it is a matter of interest that at the request of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research the Council use a Reflectometer for measuring the amount of atmospheric pollution recorded by the filter papers at the three smoke measuring stations maintained in the borough by the Council. This instrument enables greater accuracy to be obtained and eliminates the possibility of human error. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT. 1960 This Act came into operation on 27th November, 1960. Under Section 1 any noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law is deemed to be a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. In London, Section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937 has for many years given Metropolitan Borough Councils power to deal with noise as a nuisance under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, where a person made or caused to be made or continued an excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which was injurious or dangerous to health. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960 amended this Section to conform with the new meaning of noise nuisance. Local authorities are now able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance (not necessarily injurious or dangerous to health) by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance, and, if the Notice is not complied with, it can be enforced by proceedings in a Magistrate's Court. Apart from action by a local authority, any three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make complaint direct to a Magistrate. Complaints are received in the department from time to time regarding noise nuisances, mainly arising as a result of industrial work. In all cases, during 1962, remedies were secured without recourse to legal action. It should be noted that, in the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business, it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practicable means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. except in the special circumstances defined in subsection 2 of the section, and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment, with the exception that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are on sale: the loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. - 30 - PUBLIC BATHS The Minister of Health (Circular l/6o) has requested that reference should be made to any public swimming baths in the borough. The Council have provided indoor swimming pools at the Public Baths situated in North Kensington at the junction of Lancaster Road and Silchester Road. The original building was constructed about seventy years ago and no major structural alterations have since taken place. There were four swimming pools, two of which have now been discontinued. The swimming pools now available are as follows:- (1) The large mixed swimming pool. (2) The small mixed swimming pool. The large pool has an area of approximately 4,500 sq.ft. and the smaller one is one-third of this area. Both pools are available for swimming in the summer months, mid-April to mid-October, but during the winter months only the large pool will be available to the public. The water used for swimming is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board's supply at the commencement of the bathing season, and throughout the season it is treated by a continuous filtration system. The filtration process consists of drawing water from the deep end of the pool through a suitable strainer and, after the addition of coagulants to flocculate organic matter and to obtain efficient filtration, the water is pumped to the top of four Vertical Air-Scoured Pressure Filters. The water, before filtration, is sterilised; this is done by introducing chlorinated water into the circulating flow from "Wallace & Tiernan" Automatic Residual Chlorine Control equipment, with hydraulic solution feeder for automatic pH Control. This gives an accurate method of controlling the dosage. The chlorinator automatically injects water chlorinated to the correct strength and at the same time adjusts the doses to suit varying bathing loads. The amount of chlorination provided operates on the principle of "breakpoint chlorination" and is recorded on a chart from which the degree of sterilisation of the water is known at any time during the swimming season. The filter units consist of vertical closed cylinders containing graded Non-Friable Leighton Buzzard Sand supported on a bed of graded granite chippings, through which the water passes at a rate of 230 gallons per square foot of filter area per hour. The sand has to be washed regularly - this is done by steam and air agitation and reversing the flow of water, which runs to waste and carries impurities with it. Water taken from the pools is used for the washing process. The filtered water is then aerated, thereby assisting in the maintenance of bacterial purity. It is then heated by calorifiers to about 75°F. It re-enters the swimming pools through suitable inlets at the shallow ends, and scum troughs have been provided on the sides of the pools which draw off any pollution which may accumulate near the surface, together with any dust which settles thereon. - 31 - The new equipment has been designed, to give a turnover period up to 31½ hours, which is about twice that obtained from the old plant. By this means, quicker purification of water is obtained and is particularly beneficial during peak periods. The whole of the new equipment has been designed to comply with the latest recommendations of the Ministry of Health for indoor swimming pools. Samples of water in the pools are taken from time to time, and during 1962 the results obtained were well within the bacteriological standards recommended by the Ministry of Health. The residual chlorine similarly was maintained within the concentration advocated. PUBLIC MORTUARY For many years, the Council maintained a public mortuary at No.1a, Hornton Place, V.8. In 1958, the Coroner decreed that all bodies of persons dying within Kensington coming under his jurisdiction should be taken to the Hammersmith mortuary, which adjoins the Vest London Coroner's Court. Consequently, the Council closed their premises and made an arrangement with the Hammersmith Borough Council that all Kensington cases should be accommodated in the Hammersmith mortuary. The agreement provides that an annual payment of £500 shall be made for this service. Details regarding the number of Kensington cases admitted during 1962 to the Hammersmith mortuary in accordance with the agreement are as follows By Order of Coroner 13 By Order of Police Nil On application of Undertaker 4 417 BURIAL OF THE DEAD Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, imposes on the Council the duty to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies, or is found dead, within the borough, where no suitable private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. The Council have authorised the Medical Officer of Health to make arrangements for the burial of any person to whom the Section applies. In the twelve months ended 31st December, 1962, the Council became responsible for the burial of 47 persons dying in the borough. The following is a summary of the action taken:- - 32 - (a) Cases where the funeral expenses have been fully recovered 27 (b) Cases where part only of the expenses has been recovered 12 (i)Number of these where balance of expenses will be recovered 2 (amounting to £21.l6s.lld.) (ii) Number of these where there was no further estate or "liable" relative 3 (iii) Number of these where "liable" relatives were unable to contribute 7 (c) Cases where full cost has been borne by the Council 8 (i) Number of these where expenses will be recovered 1 (amounting to £17. 0s. 0d.) (ii) Number of these where there was no estate or "liable" relative 5 (iii) Number of these where "liable" relatives were unable to contribute 2 Amount recovered by the end of the year £459. 2s. 1d. Additional amount expected to be recovered £38.16s.11d. £497.19s. 0d. Irrecoverable £137.16s. 3d. Total cost £635.15s. 3d. Of the forty-seven cases dealt with, twenty-five were eligible for Death Grant from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. The total amount recovered from this source amounted to £325. 3s. 0d. (included in the above figures). Since the National Assistance Act came into force on 5th July, 1948, the Council have arranged for the burial of 556 persons. BOROUGH CREMATION SERVICE The Council have an arrangement with the General Cemetery Company who own the Kensal Green Crematorium at the north-west corner of the borough, whereby a reduced charge is made for the cremation of Kensington residents, subject to certain financial conditions. The following table shows the number of cremations and cost to the Council since 1955/56:— Year No. of Cremations Cost to Council 1955/56 256 £256. 4s. 0d. 1956/57 253 £252. 0s. 0d. 1957/58 277 £260.18s. 6d. 1958/59 304 £275. 12s. 6d. 1959/60 241 £242. 0s. 6d. 1960/61 327 £278. 0s. 0d. 1961/62 314 £276. 3s. 0d. These figures compare with only 60 Kensington cremations in 1948 (prior to the arrangement coming into effect). - 33- MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF STAFF The Medical Officer of Health arranges all medical examinations of staff for the purposes of the Council's superannuation Scheme. During the year 184 examinations were made. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE The Council have accepted the responsibility, within their powers, for co-ordinating and assisting in the extension of activities for aged persons and to alleviate unsatisfactory conditions under which many old people are living. Co-operation with voluntary bodies interested in the welfare of old people is effected wherever possible. Four members of the Public Health Committee serve on the Kensington Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee, which acts as a co-ordinating nonexecutive committee through which voluntary bodies claim assistance from the Council and through which the Council pass requests for executive action. Grants to Clubs, etc. Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, was reenacted by the National Assistance Act, 1948 (Amendment) Act, 1962. The effect is to extend the powers of the Council to enable them:- (a) to assist voluntary organisations to provide meals or recreation for old people, by making contributions to the cost of the service; providing, by gift or loan or otherwise, furniture, vehicles or equipment; permitting them to use premises belonging to the Council, and making available the service of the Council's staff connected with the premises or vehicles which the organisation is permitted to use; (b) to provide meals and recreation for old people, either directly or through the agency of voluntary organisations, and to recover such charges (if any) as the Council may determine, having regard to the cost of the service. During the year, the Council made grants as follows:- (a) The Kensington Communal Kitchen Service were granted £850 as a contribution towards the cost of operating a meals-on-wheels service in co-operation with the Kensington Women's Voluntary Services. (b) The West London Old Age Pensioners' Angling Competition Committee were granted £5 towards the cost of their annual competition. (c) The Kensington Men's Old Age Pensioners' Club were granted £15 towards the cost of equipment (games). (d) The St. Mary's Priory Old People's Club were granted £150 towards the cost of furniture and equipment for their new club premises. (e) The Kensington Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee were granted £35 to assist in meeting their general expenditure. - 34 - (f) The Kensington Women's Voluntary Services' Home from Home Club, now in the Old Central Library, were granted £60 towards their general expenses. Holidays Since April, 1951, "the Council in co-operation with the Family Welfare Association, have operated a scheme for providing holidays for old people. During 1962 advance bookings were made with the Southsea Hotel and Boarding House Association for the second and third weeks of May, and with the Ramsgate and District Hotel and Boarding House Association for the third and fourth weeks of May and September. The terms quoted for Southsea were £4. 5s. Od. per week, and for Ramsgate £4.19s. Od. per week. The old people made a contribution of £2 per week, and private coaches were hired to take them to and from the holiday establishments. The Hotel and Boarding House Associations provided entertainments, coach outings and other concessions during the holidays. As in other years, applications for holidays were investigated by the Woman Health Officer, approved by the Chairman, and then passed to the Family Welfare Association for the holidays to be arranged. A sum of Five Shillings per booking was paid to the Family Welfare Association towards their administration expenses. The following is a summary of the action taken:- Total number of old people who applied 184 Number considered unsuitable on medical grounds 8 Number referred to London County Council for recuperative holidays 3 11 Number of applications approved by the Chairman 173 Cancellations after approval 35 Number sent on holiday:- To Southsea To Ramsgate 35 103 138 173 In the main, the reason for cancellation after approval by the Chairman was ill health. Cost of holidays £ s. d. Board and lodging fees and fares Booking fees paid to the Family Welfare Association 1,447. 2. 0. 28. 15. 0. Less contribution by applicants 554. 5. 0. Actual cost to Council £921. 12. 0. In each case the holiday was for a period of two weeks. - 35 - Letters of appreciation have been received from many of the old people concerned, and all those participating expressed their utmost satisfaction when seen by the Woman Health Officer on their return home. No applicant was placed on the waiting list. Advice Leaflets The Council arrange for the publication of a pamphlet giving information on the services available in the borough for old people individually or through a club. The pamphlet was revised during the year and a new edition printed. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance send to every person in London reaching retirement pension age, a leaflet giving general information on welfare services for old people. S.O.S. Cards Window display cards are provided by the Council, bearing the letters "S.O.S." in red on one side, and on the reverse side directions how to use the card, with space for particulars of nextof-kin or nearest relative. These cards are distributed to appropriate old people. Any person seeing one of the cards in a window is able to summon help from one of the sources given on the back of the card. The local press have generously assisted in making this service known. Institutional and Domiciliary Care of the Aged Sick Institutional care, home nursing, sick room equipment and home helps are provided by the London County Council. Hospital treatment, medical care,ophthalmic, dental and pharmaceutical services are provided under statute by the Minister of Health. One Hospital Management Committee in the northern portion of the borough utilizes the part-time service of a local medical practitioner as a clinical assessor to decide the priority need for admission of all patients submitted to that Hospital Group as being in need of hospital treatment and classed as "chronic sick." Cases on the chronic sick waiting lists of St. Mary Abbots Hospital in the southern part of the borough are visited and assessed by the Council's women health officers. This ensures the early or immediate admission of patients where the need is urgent on medicosocial grounds. There is usually no difficulty in the admission to hospital for the treatment of acute conditions. Where necessary, medical care, home nursing, home helps, convalescent holidays, financial aid and pensions are arranged with the appropriate statutory bodies. These, together with various services operated by the Council augmented by voluntary bodies, are provided to such good effect that in many cases the need for hospital admission is postponed indefinitely. The number of "chronic sick" visits by the women health officers during the year totalled 711. It was necessary to arrange for 23 old people to be admitted to hospitals for institutional treatment and, in addition, 15 cases were admitted to homes for the aged. Domiciliary Cleansing Arrangements have been made whereby old people's living accommodation and household articles are cleansed and, if necessary, disinfested. Thirteen old people were dealt with in 1962. - 36 - Laundry At present no direct authority exists for the Council to provide a laundry service, as such, for old people. Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, enables the Council to cause any article in the house to be cleansed, disinfected or destroyed, if it is in such a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby. The cleansing of grossly fouled bedding in cases of incontinence may be dealt with under this section. To comply with the legal requirements, the Council have given a general authority to the Medical Officer of Health to take whatever action appears to him to be necessary under the terms of Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In 80 cases action was taken under the section. The bedding was marked, laundered at the Council's disinfecting station and returned to the old people. The scheme works smoothly and appears to fill a much felt want. Prom stocks of bedding held, the Council are able to supply linen and bedding on loan to old people while their own is being laundered, and where possible voluntary organisations are asked to undertake replacements of much worn articles. During the year 1,699 separate collections of laundry were made under this scheme, and the number of articles cleansed totalled 17,865. Library Facilities The Libraries Committee co-operates in providing books for old people confined to their homes. The circulation of the books is effected by the Women's Voluntary Services mobile library. Chiropody The London County Council, with the approval of the Minister of Health, extended their functions under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, to include a chiropody service, giving priority to the needs of old people, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers. They make a grant to the Kensington Old People's Welfare Committee for the purpose of enabling the provision of a chiropody service for housebound old people. The Kensington Branch of the British Red Cross Society have accepted responsibility for the complete administration of the service in the borough, and all the patients are referred to them through the Public Health Department. The total number of persons treated under the home chiropody scheme was, and the number of treatments given was 720. Meals Service The arrangements for meals either delivered to old people in their homes or in canteens were continued with great success by the Women's Voluntary Services in conjunction with the Kensington Communal Services Committee. The Women's Voluntary Services undertake the work of verifying the bona fides of applicants, arrange delivery of meals at the homes of old people, and collect the money (10d. - 37 - per meal). The Kensington Communal Services Committee supply the meals and the vehicles for delivery. The following statement shows the progress of the service and financial effect since the inception of the schemes:- Period Number of Meals Gross Cost Receipts from old people Subsidy from L.C.C.

Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council have power to make grants to voluntary bodies undertaking the supply of meals to old people and a grant of £850 was made to the Kensington Communal Services Committee for 1962/63. Visiting The Council's women health officers visit old people brought to their notice. A comprehensive record system is kept of old people in the borough including personal particulars, environmental conditions and special needs. The local voluntary organisations supply records of old people whom they help and every endeavour is made to keep this information up-to-date. The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Council's women health officers in connection with the care of old people during the year 1962:- Cases on register at the beginning of year 5,122 New cases added to register 600 Cases removed to hospital 23 Cases removed to homes (voluntarily) 15 Cases removed to homes (compulsorily) Nil Cases removed from district 140 Number of deaths 371 Total number of cases remaining on register at end of year 5,173 Number of old people sent away for holiday 138 Number of old people provided with Council's laundry service 80 Number of old people provided with "Meals on Wheels" 214 - 38 - Cases referred to National Assistance Board 91 Cases referred for assistance from Home Help 187 Department Cases referred for assistance from voluntary organisations 115 Cases referred to recreational Clubs 130 Number of visits to chronic sick cases 711 Cases assisted with provision of medical and nursing care 62 Cases referred to home chiropody service 100 Cases where disinfestation was carried out 13 Number of initial home visits made 471 Number of re-visits 3,189 Number of other visits made in connection with old people, including visits to clubs 69 Number of interviews, enquiries, etc. on behalf of old people 2,675 Removal of old and infirm persons to institutions, etc. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council may apply to a Court for an order to remove to a suitable institution any person who- (a) is suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, is living in insanitary conditions, and (b) is unable to devote to himself, or is not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, amended Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and provided that application for removal of urgent cases may be made by the local authority or by the Medical Officer of Health, if authorised by the Council to do so, without giving seven days' notice as previously required. Such applications may be made either to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction or to a single Justice, on a certificate by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner. Further, where the hospital or institution agree to receive the case, it is not necessary to give seven days' notice to the manager thereof. Detention Orders made in respect of these urgent cases are limited to three weeks, and if it is necessary to extend this time, compliance must be made with the original requirements of Section 47. Although many cases of old people were investigated during the year, in no case was formal action taken to secure compulsory removal to an institution. - 39 - SANITARY INSPECTION The following table shows a summary of the inspections, etc. carried, out by the public health inspectors and their assistants during the year:- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Houses inspected on complaint 2,396 Houses inspected after infectious disease 1,525 Re-inspections 6,230 Smoke observations 24 Other inspections 1,240 Housing Act. 1957 Initial inspection of dwelling houses 409 Re-inspections 841 Initial inspections for overcrowding 400 Re—inspections 731 Underground Living Rooms Initial inspections 504 Re-inspections 2,213 Drainage Applications 385 Plans submitted 349 House drains inspected 7,663 House drains tested 811 Factories Act. 1961 Premises inspected 229 Outworkers' premises inspected 191 Clean Air Act, 1956 Total inspections 4,186 The following table shows the number of notices issued in respect of nuisances, defects, etc. found during the year:- Public Health (London) Act. 1936 Intimation notices 823 Statutory notices 289 Final notices 108 Various Factories Act 5 Report of waste water to the Metropolitan Water Board 41 Report of dangerous structures to the London County Council 31 Other notices 110 40 The following is a summary of the principal works completed under the supervision of the public health inspectors during the year:- House drains, reconstructed or repaired 263 House drains cleansed 113 Water closets, reconstructed or repaired 81 Water closets, new provided 492 Soil pipes, vent pipes, repaired, etc. 37 Soil pipes, vent pipes, new provided 171 Baths, new provided 398 Sinks, new provided 303 Lavatory basins, new provided 739 Bidets, new provided 23 Waste pipes, new provided 397 Cisterns, cleansed 1 Dustbins provided 51 Accumulations of filth, etc. removed 138 Roofs repaired 138 Dampness in dwellings remedied 154 Artificial lighting to staircases provided 3 Houses disinfected after infectious disease (including bedding, etc.) 118 Rooms in such houses, disinfected after infectious disease 191 Verminous houses cleansed (including bedding, clothing, etc.) 277 Verminous rooms in such houses, cleansed 530 Other sanitary works executed 253 HOUSING Inspection of dwelling houses during the year (i) (a) Dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Act) 6,474 (b) Inspections made for the purpose 24,397 (ii) (a) Dwelling houses (including those under head (i) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 409 (b) Inspections made for the purpose 1,250 (iii) Dwelling houses found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 882 Remedy of defects without service of formal notices Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action under the Housing or Public Health Acts 593 Action under statutory powers during the year (a) Premises repaired after service of formal notice under the Public Health (London) Acts- (i) By owners 283 (ii) By local authority in default 6 41- (b) Action under Sections 9, 10 and 12 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (i) Dwelling houses in respect of which notices under Section 9 were served requiring repairs 3 (ii) Dwelling houses which were rendered fit by owners under Section 9 6 (iii) Dwelling houses rendered fit by the Council in default of owners 2 (c) Action under Sections 16, 17 and 23 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (i) Dwelling houses in respect of which demolition orders were made 4 (ii) Dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of demolition orders 6 (iii) Dwelling houses in respect of which closing orders, in lieu of demolition orders, were made 1 (iv) Dwelling houses in respect of which undertakings were accepted from owner to render premises fit for habitation Nil (v) Dwelling houses rendered fit for habitation by owners and closing order determined Nil (d) Action under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (i) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders were made 38 (91 rooms) (ii) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders were determined, the tenements or rooms having been rendered fit 58 (113 rooms) (iii) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which closing orders operate, but where the Council consented during the year to the use of the rooms for purposes other than sleeping 22 (39 rooms) (iv) Separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which the Council accepted undertakings from owners to render fit within specified time 8 (19 rooms) (v) Undertakings cancelled 4 (7 rooms) (e) Housing Act, 1957, Part IV - Overcrowding:- (i) Number of dwellings overcrowded at end No reliable of year estimate.

Name of Area Date of Declaration No. of houses No. of persons displaced Elgin Mews 25. 4.1950 28 86 Lionel Mews (Nos.l and 2) 3.10.1950 13 38 Lonsdale Mews (Nos. 1 and 2) 2. 1.1951 19 14 Munro Mews 2. 1.1951 24 55 South End Row and Gardens 3. 4.1951 10 4 East Mews Road 3. 4.1951 14 40 Powis Mews 13.11.1951 13 30 St. Luke's Mews 13.11.1951 20 41 Portobello Road 13.11.1951 4 3 Kensal New Town (No.l) Area 11.12.1956 34 309 Kensal New Town (No.2) Area 14. 1.1958 62 441 Kensal New Town (No.3) Area 14. 1.1958 15 146 Portland Road (No.l) Area 11. 3.1958 5 31 Portland Road (No.2) Area 11. 3.1958 10 71 Kensal New Town (No.4) Area 8. 3.1960 7 41 Kensal New Town (No.5) Area 8. 3.1960 20 187 Kensal New Town (No.6) Area 8.3.1960 6 62 Railway Mews Area Portobello Road/ 10. 5.1960 10 7 Telford Road Area 17.10.1961 18 127 On 13th February, 1962, the Council made a Compulsory Purchase Order in respect of the clearance area Nos. 375 to 401 (odd) Portobello Road and Nos. 5 to 11 (odd) Telford Road. The Compulsory Purchase Order included the sites Nos. 5 to 11 (odd) Lionel Mews, as adjoining land, the acquisition of which is reasonably necessary for the satisfactory development of the area. A public local inquiry was held on 21st June, 1962, and the Order was subsequently confirmed by the Minister with certain modifications. The modifications are the exclusion of No.7 Telford Road (as the property had been acquired by the Council), and the transfer of Nos. 375 and 381 Portobello Road to Part II of the Schedule to the Order as land outside the clearance area. The redevelopment of this site will comprise two blocks of dwellings containing 18 maisonnettes and 24 flats. The London County Council have been engaged in slum clearance operations, using Parts III and V of the Housing Act, 1957, and the following areas have been, or are being, dealt with:- - 43 - (a) Fenelon Place/Ashley Cottages/Warwick Road Area - containing 66 premises. This site has been cleared. (b) Nos. 12/46 (even) Bosworth Road. This clearance area and adjoining land will be used for an extension of the Emslie Horniman Pleasance. (c) Nos.325/335 Kensal Road. This clearance area is in that part of Kensal New Town development area zoned for industrial purposes. (d) Nos.68/76 (even) Southern Row. These properties are in an area of about one acre which the Minister of Housing and Local Government proposes to re-zone from light industry to residential (1962/1967). Programme for Slum Clearance Blechynden Street Area/Lancaster Road (Vest) Area. Negotiations have taken place between the Council and the London County Council in regard to the proposal to redevelop an area known as the "Blechynden Street area." The allocation of responsibility between the two authorities has been agreed as follows:- To be developed by the London County Council: Blechynden Street area north-west of railway - Gross area in acres 8.30 To be developed by the Council: Blechynden Street area south-east of railway - Gross area in acres 11.40 It will be appreciated that by no means all the properties in this area are suitable for action under "slum clearance," and the extent to which action under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957, can be taken will depend on the results of a survey of individual properties. In connection with that part of the Blechynden Street area allocated to the County Council, Compulsory Purchase Orders have been made during the year by that Council in respect of the following premises:- 1-3 (cons.) Bramley Mews 43-49 (odd) and 53-59 (odd) Bramley Road 33-67 (odd), 73-81 (odd) and 56-78 (even) Blechynden Street 1-17 (odd), 8, 10 and 16 East Mews Road 1-25 (odd) Lockton Street 1-15 (odd), 2-14 (even) Martin Street 36-44 (cons.) Mersey Street 33-41 (odd) Oldham Road 35-43 (odd) Silchester Road 21-33 (odd) and 2-30 (even) Silchester Terrace In regard to that part of the Blechynden Street area to be dealt with by the Kensington Council, it was decided that it should be increased by the addition of 4.83 acres containing the following properties:- - 44 - 1-39 (odd) and 4-28 (even) Camelford Road 122-134- (even) Clarendon Road 24-82 (even) Cornwall Crescent 11-39 (odd) and 6-22 (even) St. Marks Road 5-55 (odd) and 2-28 (even) Talbot Grove Kensal New Town Area. This area, consisting of over 20 acres, is scheduled for clearance. The first portion of 6½ acres has been dealt with by the Borough Council, and the redevelopment of the site by the erection of new flats and maisonnettes is well in progress. The remaining portion of the Kensal New Town Area, which is zoned for residential development, will be dealt with by the Council and the London County Council on the following basis:- (i) The Council will undertake the redevelopment of 3.1 acres to the north and 1.62 acres to the south of the 6½ acres upon which they are at present engaged. This area, including the present 6½ acres, is bounded by Kensal Road, Golborne Road, Bosworth Road and the railway. (ii) The London County Council will undertake the redevelopment of 7.2 acres to the east of the borough council's present 6½ acres. This area is bounded by Golborne Road, Kensal Road and the railway. The London County Council will also be responsible for the redevelopment of a small area of 0.41 acres between Kensal Road and the canal, to the west of an area in Paddington, of 3.6 acres, which the County Council now propose to zone as open space in place of the open space of 3.6 acres originally proposed at the eastern end of the area. The London County Council will be responsible for school extensions and the provision of additional open space north of Kensal Road. The western area of Kensal New Town, which is scheduled for non-residential purposes, will be dealt with by the London County Council as and when convenient. IMPROVEMENT OR CONVERSION OF EXISTING HOUSES Owners of private dwellings may apply to the Council for assistance towards carrying out works of improvement or conversion. One aim is to encourage owners to provide services and amenities in houses which are sound but which were built to a lower standard than is generally acceptable nowadays. The other is to encourage the provision of additional satisfactory dwellings, either by ing the large outmoded house from one dwelling into a number of flats, or by converting an old building into one or more dwellings. Grants are not intended to help owners meet the cost of ordinary repairs and renewals, nor are they intended to adapt a perfectly adequate dwelling to the needs of a particular family. They are not normally payable for the provision of extra living rooms or bedrooms, or for increasing the size of existing rooms. They are not payable for the improvement of premises used primarily or partly for business purposes. Two methods of application are available. The first is to apply for an improvement grant - known as a discretionary grantunder the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. The maximum - 45 - grant payable is one half of the approved expenditure (which must not be less than £100) subject to a maximum allowance of £400. In considering a scheme of improvement or conversion submitted for grant, only one question may properly be asked, namely, whether it will produce a satisfactory modernised dwelling complying with the statutory conditions and the specified ments. The requirements which the Minister of Housing and Local Government has specified for a dwelling, in respect of which an improvement grant may be made, are as follows The dwelling must, after improvement or conversion- 1. Be in a good state of repair and substantially free from damp; 2. have each room properly lighted and ventilated; 3. have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on inside the dwelling; 4. be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes; 5. have an internal or otherwise readily accessible water closet; 6. have a fixed bath (or shower) preferably in a separate room; 7. be provided with a sink or sinks and with suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; 8o have a proper drainage system; 9. be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available); 10. be provided with adequate facilities for heating; 11. have satisfactory facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food; 12. have proper provision for the storage of fuel (where required). Applications for improvement (discretionary) grants received and dealt with during 1962 are summarised as follows:- Applications received 17 Applications granted 14 Applications refused 3 Total amount of grants approved £5,067. 0s. 0d. The second method is to apply for standard grants, which were introduced by the House Purchase & Housing Act, 1959, which came into operation on 14th June, 1959. The Act sets up a new system of standard grants to supplement the present system of - 46 - improvement grants paid at the discretion of the local authority. The distinctive features of the new system are that these grants are payable only in respect of the provision of specified standard amenities and on the expenditure actually incurred for this purpose; and that provided certain conditions are satisfied the owner of the property can claim the grant as of right. The new system has been designed to produce as simple a procedure as possible and enable owners generally to form a reasonably accurate idea of the assistance they can hope to receive before any expense is incurred. It is designed to deal in the main with relatively straightforward cases in which the improvements involve little or no structural alteration, leaving the present system of discretionary grants to deal with the more elaborate proposals. There are five standard amenities (listed in Section 4(l) as shown below) eligible for standard grant, which is one half of the cost shown to have been incurred in executing the works involved, subject to a maximum payment of £155. The maximum payment is reduced by the amount shown in parenthesis in cases where the particular provision is omitted, as having been already provided:- (a) A fixed bath or shower in a bathroom (£25) (b) A wash-hand basin (£5) (c) A hot water supply (£?5) (d) A water closet for the dwelling (£40) (e) Satisfactory facilities for storing food (£10) These amenities mast be for the exclusive use of the occupants of the particular dwelling. The dwelling must after improvement be equipped with all five standard amenities; conversely., grant is not payable towards the cost of providing a second water closet or other amenity if there is already one in the house. If a hot water supply is provided, it must be connected to a sink as well as to the bath or shower and wash-hand basin (Section 4(5))° No application for a standard grant can be entertained if the dwelling concerned was provided after the end of 1944, with one exception. If the dwelling was produced by conversion and the original building was erected before the end of 1944, then provided the conversion was completed not later than the end of 1958, the dwelling will be eligible for standard grant purposes (Section 4(6)). As under the existing discretionary grant system, for grant to be payable the approval of the authority must be obtained before work is begun and the work must be done to their satisfaction (Section 4(l)). During 1962, four applications for standard grants were received in respect of individual premises. Of these, three were refused as the statutory conditions were not complied with, The application approved was in respect of the provision of a washbasin (£5). - 47 - Houses in Multiple Occupation (including hostels) In the last few years the Council have given very serious consideration to the question of improving tenement houses. Many attempts have been made to obtain improvements by exercising the Council's powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. These attempts, however, have been frequently frustrated, partly because of the difficulty of ascertaining exactly who was the legal owner at any particular time. A further difficulty was the reluctance of some tenants to attend court. One of the factors mainly accounting for the squalid appearance of these houses was the condition of the entrance halls, the communal staircases and kitchens. The artificial lighting of the halls and staircases was adequate, but the decorations were old and drab. These parts of the houses were seldom swept, with the result that there was an accumulation of litter. Many of the communal kitchens presented an even worse appearance, food refuse having been left about, and little attempt seemed to have been made to clean stoves, sinks or floors. It was doubtful whether the bathrooms were much used, probably owing to lack of hot water, and the condition of many of the water closets indicated lack of normal cleansing. The method of letting produced a great volume of refuse, and the number of bins needed could not be housed in the small front areas and cellars. As a result, some were kept in the flats and, on collection day, all were brought down and stacked on the front entrance steps. Some refuse was thrown out of rear windows into the areas, where it choked the drains. On 24th November, 1961, a new Housing Act came into operation providing new powers for dealing with bad living conditions in houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, (it also makes a number of changes in the law affecting condemned houses, improvement grants, town development and housing subsidies.) The new Act provides, amongst other powers:- (i) A new power to apply a code of management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed. The requirements of this code are prescribed in the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962, which came into operation on 22nd May, 1962. (ii) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions, and the provision of adequate means of escape from fire. (iii) A power for local authorities to carry out works themselves in default and recover the cost. (iv) A new power to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house, or part of a house, which is in multiple occupation. The new powers are designed to deal primarily with the worst type of multi-occupied house. Part I of the Regulations mentioned in (i) above deals with their application and interpretation; Part II prescribes the duties of management to be discharged by the manager of the house; and - 48 - Part III deals with ancillary requirements including the provision of information. It also places certain obligations on occupants for the purpose of ensuring that the manager can effectively carry out his duties. Responsibility for management will rest on an owner or lessee who receives the rents or other payments from tenants or lodgers, including any agent or trustee through whom the rents are received. The main substance of the code of management is contained in Part II of the Regulations which deals with the manager's responsibilities for repair and maintenance. Broadly, these responsibilities amount to ensuring the repair (including reasonable decorative repair), cleanliness and good order of the parts of the house in common use; the proper maintenance throughout the house of installations for basic services, such as water supply, drainage, gas and electricity; the repair and good order of all means of ventilation and means of escape from fire. The manager is also required to ensure an adequate provision of refuse bins and to take reasonable precautions to protect tenants from injury as a result of structural conditions in the house. Where rooms are let to tenants or lodgers as their living accommodation, the manager must ensure that the rooms are clean and in a reasonable state of structural repair at the commencement of the letting and that defects are remedied in the rooms which are already let, when the Regulations are applied to a house. There is a continuing obligation for the repair and proper working order of installations in the rooms, for the supply of water, gas and electricity as well as baths, sinks, basins and sanitary conveniences. In Part III of the Regulations a general obligation is placed on occupants to take reasonable care not to hinder the manager in carrying out his duties. Regulation 14- requires the manager to display in a suitable position in the house a notice containing his name and address and that of any other manager with an indication of his interest (i.e. agent or trustee), a copy of the Management Order, a copy of the Regulations and, if the local authority require, a notice which the authority may provide for indicating briefly the main provisions of the Regulations. The Regulations do not stand in isolation, and they must be taken together with existing powers under the Housing Act, 1957, and the new powers contained in the 1961 Act relating to the provision of additional services and facilities and the prevention or reduction of overcrowding. It is likely that there will be houses where Orders applying a code of management prescribed in the Regulations will be all that are necessary to bring about an improvement in conditions. In others, the reason for the unsatisfactory state of affairs will be not so much bad management as lack of essential facilities. To put this right, a local authority can require the necessary work to be done and, where need be, link the notice of works with a direction limiting the number of occupants in a house. In the very worst type of houses conditions may be so bad that, to effect any real improvement, it will be necessary to take action at one and the same time to secure better management, additional facilities, and a limitation on the number of occupants. The premises affected vary considerably, and render impracticable the provision of a single rigid code of requirements applicable to all cases. However, the Council on 29th May - 49 - 1962, adopted, the following minimum requirements as standards of essential services and amenities which they consider as satisfactory:- That a house, or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or which is occupied by members of more than one family, shall not, in the absence of special circumstances justifying a modification thereof, be regarded as reasonably suitable for such occupation unless the following general standards obtain:- A. Natural and artificial lighting: (i) The provision and maintenance in every habitable room, of a window or windows (capable of being opened at the top), opening directly to the external air, and having, where practicable, a glass area equal to at least onetenth of the floor area. (ii) The provision and maintenance, wherever practicable, of adequate means of natural light to a common staircase. (iii) There shall be provided and maintained suitable means for securing adequate artificial lighting either by electricity or gas in each habitable room, kitchen, bathroom and water closet. (Staircase lighting is already dealt with under Bye-laws.) B. Ventilation: The provision and maintenance of adequate means of ventilation for every passage, room, water closet apartment and staircase. C. Water Supply: (i) The provision of one tap per floor and, if more than one letting, one tap inside each letting whenever practicable. In each case the provision of a sink of suitable size and pattern and efficient means for carrying off any waste water from the tap. (ii) The provision in every hostel, boarding house, guest house and boarding school, of a water supply reasonably accessible to the occupants of each sleeping room. In addition to the requirements of the Metropolitan Water Board Byelaw No.24 (1950), relating to the provision of a stop tap for each separately chargeable supply, it is suggested that, whenever practicable, a stop tap should be fitted for each floor or each separate letting, whichever is the more convenient. D. Personal Washing Facilities: In each letting there shall be provided a hot and cold water supply at a wash-hand basin or at a sink. There shall also be provided in connection with each letting a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom with hot and cold water. Where it is impracticable for the bathroom to be within the letting, it shall be in such a position within the curtilage of the building as to be readily accessible from the letting. In such cases the provision shall be in the ratio of one fixed bath or shower to ten persons irrespective of age. - 50 - E. Sanitary Conveniences: (i) If practicable, the provision and maintenance of one water closet for every four habitable rooms, or one water closet for every eight persons irrespective of age; existing accommodation is to be deemed insufficient if it fails to conform to both of these requirements, or if it is not reasonably accessible to the persons for whom it is intended; except in the case of (ii) hostels, boarding houses and similar establishments, where one water closet for every eight persons, sited so as to be conveniently accessible in relation to sleeping rooms shall be deemed sufficient; and (iii) boarding schools; where a standard of one water closet for every five pupils, as laid down in the Standards for School Premises Regulations, 1959, should be borne in mind; and (iv) future conversion to single room lettings, where one water closet for every four lettings and not more than one floor distant shall be required; and (v) existing single room lettings, where, if practicable, there must be a provision of one water closet for every four lettings or for every eight persons irrespective of age, the accommodation to be deemed insufficient if it fails to conform to both of these requirements. P. Facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food: The provision inside each separate dwelling (as distinct from a staircase or landing in common use), of adequate facilities for cooking food, and a food cupboard ventilated to the external air and of dimensions not less than:- One room dwelling 3 cu.ft. A two room dwelling 4 „ A three room dwelling 6 „ A dwelling comprising more than three rooms 8 „ (These requirements relate to separate dwellings in family occupation. In the case of bed-sitting rooms in use as bachelor apartments, facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food, are normally not necessary and in such circumstances these provisions will not be required.) G. Installations for space heating or for the use of space heating appliances: In each dwelling there shall be provided an adequate number of appliances for space heating or suitable points to which gas or electric space heating appliances can be attached. - 51 - H. Overcrowding: The provision in hostels and. boarding schools of minimum floor space of 60 sq. ft. per person, and the prohibition of the use of any underground room less than 7 ft. in height, or any room which does not comply with the requirements of the Council's Underground Room Regulations. By the end of the year, the new machinery for dealing with houses in multiple occupation was being operated, and two houses had been placed under Management Orders. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING OF COMMON STAIRCASES IN TENEMENT HOUSES AMD FLATS Council Byelaws relating to artificial lighting of common staircases in tenement houses and flats came into operation on 11th March, 1958. The principal Eyelaw reads as follows "The occupier of every tenement house to which these Byelaws apply and the owner of every block of flats shall provide adequate artificial lighting for all common staircases:- (a) from half an hour before sunset until 12 o'clock midnight; (b) for one hour before sunrise during the months of October, November, December, January, February and March; and (c) at other times as and when necessary if adequate means of natural lighting are not provided." During 1962 formal notices were served in 6 cases, requiring compliance with these Byelaws. CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR IN RELATION TO DWELLING HOUSES The Council's duty to issue certificates of disrepair in respect of "rent controlled" dwelling houses, not reasonably suitable for occupation, is governed by the Rent Act, 1957. The following is a summary of the action taken during 1962:- Part I- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair Number of applications for certificates 5 Number of decisions not to issue certificates Nil Number of decisions to issue certificates- (a) in respect of some but not all defects 2 (b) in respect of all defects 3 Number of undertakings given by landlords 2 Number of undertakings refused by Council Nil Number of certificates issued 3 Part II - Applications for cancellation of Certificates Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 4 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 2 Decision by Council to cancel in spite of tenant's objection 1 Certificates cancelled. 3 - 52 - OVERCROWDING All cases of overcrowding are dealt with on the strict interpretation of the standards laid down in the Housing Act, 1957: distinguishing between "penal" and "non-penal" cases. The number of new cases of overcrowding reported to the Committee during 1962 was 130, giving an equivalent number of persons of 503. The total number of overcrowding cases which were recorded during the year as having been abated was 170, comprising a total of 691 units. ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING PRIORITIES ON MEDICAL GROUNDS During the year, 167 applications for rehousing on medical grounds were examined, and recommendations for the award of additional points were made to the Chief Housing Officer, In each case the precise medical condition and resultant disability were determined (frequently necessitating communication with the family doctor or with the hospital attended). The premises were inspected in detail to ascertain the extent and nature of the existing accommodation; the adequacy of day and sleeping space; the risk of infection; the existence of remediable or irremediable sanitary or structural defects, and the existence of inconveniences, such as stairs, which might be prejudicial to the patient. On this information and that supplied by the Chief Housing Officer, an assessment of points to be awarded on medical grounds was made in 162 cases. PROVISION OF NEW HOUSING ACCOMMODATION The post-war housing schemes completed in Kensington by the Council have provided 1,748 flats. The total number of properties under Council management at the end of 1962 is summarised in the following table:- Housing Properties 1890 Act 18 Cottage Estates 218 1919 Conversions 96 Pre-war Flats 293 Sundry Properties 74 699 Temporary Bungalows 48 Compulsory Purchase Area/Properties 7 1949 Act Conversions 117 Post-war Flats 1.748 1,920 Nos.27/29, Hazlewood Crescent 10 Properties formerly requisitioned (in Family Units) 404 Other Properties Henry Dickens Court Garages 10 Ingelow House Garages 12 25, Basing Street Garages 2 Gadsden Mews Stores and Stables 17 Lonsdale Mews Stores and Stables 17 Treverton Street Garages and Shops 14 Kensal New Town Garages 24 96 3,129 Other schemes for building new housing accommodation are in various stages of preparation. - 53 - FACTORIES Section 153(1) of the Factories Act, 1961, requires the Medical Officer of Health to make an annual report in regard to the Council's functions under the Act. The following tables give the prescribed particulars in the form requested by the Ministry of Health in Circular No.1/63, dated 30th January, 1963.

BASEMENT BAKEHOUSES The Factories Act, 1961 (Section 70), requires the Council to inspect in every fifth year all basement bakehouses in the borough for which certificates of suitability have been issued. The certificates continue to operate if the Council are satisfied that the bakehouses are still suitable. The last quinquennial review was made in 1958, and at the present time there are 6 basement bakehouses in use in the borough. They are as follows:- 151, Earls Court Road 178, Fulham Road 65, Golborne Road 79, Golborne Road 139, Portland Road 46, Walton Street - 55 - SANITARY ACCOMMODATION, ETC. IN SHOPS The Shops Act, 1950 empowers the Council to enforce in all shops- (a) suitable and sufficient means of ventilation; (b) suitable and. sufficient means of maintaining a reasonable temperature; (c) suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation. As from 1st January, 1959, the London County Council transferred to Metropolitan Borough Councils the responsibility for enforcing provisions of the Shops Act, 1950 relating to adequate lighting, suitable and sufficient washing facilities and, where employees take any meals in the shop premises, suitable and sufficient facilities for taking those meals. Under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 the Council may grant a certificate exempting a shop from the provision of suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation or washing facilities if they are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances affecting the shop it is reasonable that such a certificate should be in force, and that suitable and sufficient accommodation or facilities are otherwise conveniently available. The Council have decided that in those shops where members of both sexes are employed, separate sanitary conveniences for each sex should be required if the number of employees exceeds four, but if the number is less than four, one sanitary convenience should be regarded as suitable and sufficient, provided that the door of the convenience is fitted with a proper lock or fastener on the internal side, and an automatic indicator shows on the external side of the door whether the apartment is engaged or vacant. During the year 1962, no exemption certificate under the Shops Act was granted. Similarly, under the Food Hygiene Regulations, exemption may now be granted in food shops in respect of the provision of constant water supply, wash-hand basins with hot and cold water, cupboard or locker accommodation for outdoor clothing and facilities for washing food and equipment, if such provision cannot reasonably be required. During 1962, no exemption certificate was issued under the Pood Hygiene Regulations. REGISTER OF FACTORIES The Factories Act, 1961 requires the Council to keep a list of all factories within the borough with respect to which the duty of enforcing the provisions of the Factories Act is imposed upon them. The following table gives a summary of the factories on the Council's register at the end of the year, indicating the types of business carried on, whether or not mechanical power is used, and where situated - i.e. North or South Kensington:- The following table gives a summary of the factories on the Council's register at the end of the year, indicating the types of business carried on, whether or not mechanical power is used, and where situated - i.e. North or South Kensington:- - 56 - Factory - Business North Kensington South Kensington Mech.

FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS. 1960 These Regulations are the principal instruments for enforcing good food hygiene practice in foodshops. A summary of the main requirements is as follows:- Requirements affecting food handlers Persons handling food must- (a) keep their hands and clothing clean; (b) cover open cuts and abrasions with a water-proof dressing; (c) refrain from spitting; (d) refrain from smoking or taking snuff when handling food or when in any room where there is open food; (e) not place food so as to involve risk of contamination; (f) not allow unclean or printed wrapping material to come into contact with food; (g) notify the occupier (and owner) if suffering from, or becoming a carrier of, certain infectious conditions.

Sufficient and suitable cupboard or locker accommodation for clothing and footwear must be provided for persons engaged in or about food premises. In premises where the business consists wholly or partly of the supply of food for immediate consumption, food consisting of meat, fish, gravy or imitation cream, or prepared from or containing these substancesj, or any egg or milk, must be kept at a temperature above 145°F or below 50°F. Food in or about any forecourt, yard, market or stall must not be placed lower than 18 inches from the ground. A person guilty of an offence against any of these Regulations shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both, and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £5 for each day during which the offence continues after conviction. During the year, the public health inspectors have been engaged on surveying food premises in the borough and a total of 1,809 inspections was made. In 13 cases it was necessary to send informal notices pointing out deficiencies under the Regulations and, generally speaking, the food traders are complying with the requirements in a co-operative manner. It was, however, found necessary to take legal proceedings for contraventions of the Regulations, as follows:- - 59 - DETAILS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER FOOD HYGIENIC REGULATIONS IN 1962 As requested by Ministry of Health Circular 22/58 Date of Hearing Offence Regulations Result Fined Costs awarded to Council 9. 1.62 W.C. not kept clean 14(2) £1. 0s. 0d. £3. 3s. 0d.

Changes in licensing dealers in milk provided that:- 1. All dealers' licences, other than those issued by the Minister, will be issued by the food and drugs authority for the area in which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is soldo A dealer's licence no longer restricts sales to the area of the licensing authority and supplementary licences are therefore discontinued. 2. A new form of licence, the dealer's (pre-packed milk) licence, is introduced which may authorise, in a single form of licence, the use of any or all of the appropriate special designations where the milk is obtained by the licensed dealer pre-packed, i.e. in the container in which it is to be delivered to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer in accordance with a dealer's (pasteuriser's) licence or a dealer's (steriliser's) licence. The dealer's (tuberculin tested) licence is being retained. 3. Dealers' licences issued on or after 1st January, 1961, will be valid for five years from that date, and will be renewable for subsequent quinquennial periods. These changes in licensing procedure are designed primarily to reduce the amount of routine work involved in the administration of the Regulations. There are no milk processing depots in the borough and all the licenses granted were in relation to milk obtained in prepacked form for sale from premises in the borough. The licences granted during the year are shown in the following table together with the total numbers in force at the end of the year. - 63 - Licences issued in 1962 Total number in force at end of year Tuberculin tested milk 10 166 Pasteurised milk 11 188 Sterilised milk 5 156 The following table shows the number of samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) milk and processed milks taken during the year, together with the results of examinations Designation No. of Samples Methylene blue test Phosphatase test Turbidity test Passed Failed Passed Failed Passed Failed Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) 17 *12 1 - - - - Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 30 *29 _ 30 - - - Pasteurised 22 22 - 22 - - - Sterilised - - - - - - - *Four samples of tuberculin tested (farm bottled) milk and one sample of tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk were not submitted to the methylene blue test as the atmospheric shade temperature exceeded 70°P, which is the limit specified in the Regulations. + Details regarding this sample were sent to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations. 1969 (a) Registrations The number of persons registered under these Regulations at the end of the year, to sell milk from premises in the borough (including the sale of cream in sealed containers) was 202. (b) Unclean Milk Containers It is an offence under the Regulations for any dairy farmer or distributor to use for holding milk any vessel that is not in a state of thorough cleanliness immediately before use. In the case of bottled milk, the time "immediately before use" is considered to mean at the time the bottle is first filled and, therefore, any offence would be committed at the time and place of bottling. During the year three instances of "dirty milk bottles" were reported. In one case, details of the complaint were sent to the local authority in whose area the milk had been bottled., In the second case, which involved the same distributors as were concerned in the first case, legal proceedings were taken and a fine of £2. 0s. 0d. with £2. 2s.0d. costs were imposed. In the remaining case, a warning letter was sent to the suppliers. Composition of Milk During the year, 367 samples of milk (all grades) were submitted to the Public Analyst. Two were found to be below the legal standards; in one case legal proceedings were taken and a conviction obtained, and in the second case a warning was sent to the suppliers. - 64 - The following table shows the percentages of milk fat and nonfatty solids of the genuine samples of milk, other than Channel Islands and South Devon milks, taken during each month:- Month No. of Samples taken Average Percentages Milk Fats Non-fat Solids January 26 3.70 8.61 February 19 3.58 8.56 March 18 3.51 8.57 April 20 3.50 8.51 May 21 3.38 8.64 June 17 3.38 8.69 July 20 3.43 8.69 August 20 3.59 8.64 September 15 3.70 8.71 October 19 3.70 8.72 November 18 3.72 8.77 December 6 3.78 8.71 Average for the whole year 3.58 8.65 Legal minimum standard 3.00 8.50 Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956 These Regulations require that all milk for human consumption sold under the specific description of- Channel Islands Milk Jersey Milk Guernsey Milk or South Devon Milk must contain not less than 4% by weight of milk fat. This compares with the presumptive milk fat standard of 3% specified for ordinary milk by the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. During the year, 148 samples of these milks were taken and 2 were found to be below the legal standard laid down. The following table shows the average percentages of milk fat and non-fat solids of the genuine samples taken during each month- Month No. of Samples taken Average percentages Milk Fats Non-fat solids January 13 4.45 8.95 February 12 4.35 8.85 March 12 4.24 8.95 April 14 4.26 8.88 May 12 4.22 9.03 June 12 4.28 9.10 July 12 4.20 8.94 August 13 4.37 8.93 September 12 4.43 9.06 October 13 4.50 8.70 November 11 4.50 9.13 December 10 4.54 9.05 Average for the whole year 4.36 8.96 Legal minimum standard 4.00 8.50 - 65 - Unsound Food Seizure Under Part 1 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, it is an offence to sell, offer, or expose for sale, or to be in possession for the purpose of sale or preparation for sale, food intended for human consumption which is in an unfit condition. Such food can be seized and taken before a Justice of the Peace, who can condemn it and order it to be destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption. During the year there were two occasions when it was found necessary to enforce this procedure. One case concerned a delicatessen shop where seven chickens were found to be unfit for human consumption. They were seized and taken before a Justice of the Peace who condemned them and ordered that they be destroyed. Legal proceedings were instituted, but the case was dismissed as it was proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the defendants knew of the existence of the food, that it had been put on one side of the cold store for disposal, and that all the employees in the shop had been instructed not to use it. The other case concerned packages of seeds and spices, all of which were heavily infested by insects. The packages were seized and taken before a Justice of the Peace who condemned them and ordered that they be destroyed. Legal proceedings were instituted, and the defendant was fined £10. 0s. 0d. with £2. 2s. 0d. costs. Surrender Any person having in his possession food which is diseased, unsound, or unfit for human consumption can, under Section 180(8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, surrender it to the Council for destruction or other suitable method of disposal. During the year the following amounts of food were surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption:- Food Tons Cwts qtrs. lbs. Meat (raw) 1 1 - 19 Ham and Pork (tinned) 2 - 1 25 Other meat (tinned) 9 8 3 Sauerkraut 14 - 8 Cucumbers and Gherkins in brine 5 1 9 Fish (wet and dry) 1 1 19 Sausage 15 1 13 Cheese 7 TOTAL: 5 8 3 19 Tins, jars, packets or cartons of fruit, vegetables and miscellaneous foodstuffs 16,843 All food condemned as unfit for human consumption is collected by the Council, taken to their refuse destructor in Wood Lane and destroyed. In no instance were large quantities of food involved, necessitating special examination of stocks of food. 66 Complaints by purchasers of unfit food During the year 25 complaints were received from members of the public9 alleging the unsatisfactory condition of food purchased by them in the borough. The complaints generally related to the presence of foreign matter in foods, and the unsatisfactory condition of bread9 meat pie, chicken, liver, cheese, cream, bacon, sausages, ham and tinned beetroot. In three cases, the Public Health Committee decided to send warning letters to the vendors or manufacturers concerned. The remaining 22 cases were dealt with informally, either owing to the lack of sufficient evidence, or to the complaint not being substantiated. Adulteration of Food During the year, 574 formal samples of food and drugs were purchased, of which 19 (3.37%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. 426 informal samples were also purchased, of which 16 (3.76%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. The following table summarises the action taken in respect of defective sampless:- Unsatisfactory sample No. of Prosecutions NO. of warnings to Producers , Manufacturers or Vendors No further action Total Cheese spread with Caviar 1 12 Caviar style lumpfish roe 1 12 Lumpfish roe, Caviar style 1 - - 1 Pork sausages - 2 2 4 Strawberry jam 1 - 1 2 Double cream cheese 1 - - 1 Cream cheese 1 - - 1 Jersey milk 1- - 1 Channel Islands milk 1 - - 1 Instant coffee 1- 1 2 Dried apricots - 4 - 4 Instant cream powder - 1 - 1 Lard 1 - - 1 Ground mace - 1 - 1 Tomato concentrate - - 1* 1 Hamburger steaks with rich gravy - - 1 1 Hawaiian punch -1 - 1 Butter milk drink - - 1 1 Egg Mundels - - 1 1 Egg soup balls - - 1 1 American Bostom Cream Pie - - 1 1 Cochineal - 1 - 1 Creamed rice milk pudding - - 1 1 Minced beef loaf - - 1 1 Vegetable marrow - - 1 1 TOTALS: 9 11 15** 35 ** In all cases the results of these unsatisfactory samples were brought to the notice of the producers, manufacturers or vendors as the case may be. * Details regarding this unsatisfactory sample, a product of foreign manufacture, were sent to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. 67 Ice Cream The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959, and the Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1959, have been made jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Ice Cream Regulations prescribe standards for ice cream and introduce separate standards for "dairy ice cream" (or "dairy cream ice" or "cream ice"), and for "milk ice." The legal standards are as follows:- (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5 per cent. fat and 7½ per cent. milk solids other than fat, so however, that where ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree it shall either confirm to the above standard or, alternatively, the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½ per cent. of the whole including the fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, as the case may be, and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½ per cent. fat and 2 per cent. milk solids other than fat: Provided that as respects any ice cream sold, or offered or exposed for sale under any of the descriptions hereinafter specified, or under any such other description as is calculated to lead an intending purchaser to believe that he is purchasing ice cream of any such description as is so specified, the standard of composition shall be as follows:- (i) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than5 per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 7½ per cent. milk solids other than fat, so, however, that where any Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice or Cream Ice contains any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree it shall either conform to the standard of composition for that ice cream, or alternatively, the total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½ per cent. of the whole including the fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, as the case may be, and such total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½ per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 2 per cent. milk solids other than fat. (ii) Milk Ice, or Milk Ice containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, shall contain not less than 2½ per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 7 per cent. milk solids other than fat. (iii) "Parev" (kosher) ice shall contain not less than 10 per cent. fat and no milk fat or other derivative of milk. 68 (b) No ice cream of any description shall contain any artificial sweetener. The previous requirement that ice cream shall contain not less than 10 per cent. of sugar has been revoked. The Labelling Regulations prohibit the labelling, marking or advertising of ice cream in a manner suggestive of butter, cream, milk, or anything connected with the dairy interest unless the ice cream contains no fat other than milk (except such as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, flavouring substance, or emulsifying or stabilising agent), but permit the presence of skimmed milk solids to be declared. These regulations also provide that it is an offence to sell under the description "ice cream," any pre-packed ice cream, which contains fat other than milk fat unless it bears on the wrapper or container a declaration "Contains non-milk fat", or, if appropriate, "Contains vegetable fat," in type of a prescribed minimum size. The following table shows the number of samples (13 ice cream and 5 dairy ice cream) taken during 1962 for chemical analysis compared with those taken in the previous year:- 1961 1962 Number of samples 28 18 Variation of fat content per cent 8.6 to 20.3 8.9 to 14.O Variation of non-fat content per cent 25.O to 35.2 23.1 to 30.3 Average fat content per cent 11.10 10.72 Average non-fat solids content per cent 27.70 26.66 The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1959, require that ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are to be pasteurised by one or other of three specified methods, viz:- Method I The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 150°F. for at least 30 minutes. Method II The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than l60°F. for at least 10 minutes. Method III The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less them 170°F. for at least 15 seconds. An alternative method is by sterilisation by raising the mixture to a temperature of not less than 300°F. for at least 2 seconds. After pasteurisation or sterilisation the mixture has to be reduced to a temperature of not more than 45°F. within 1½ hours and kept at this temperature until frozen, after which it must be kept at a temperature not exceeding 28°F. up to the time of being sold. 69 There is still no legal bacteriological standard for ice cream. As in previous years, samples were taken and submitted for examination under the provisional methylene blue reduction test, which is a simple and practical means for the routine examination of ice cream. The test is not of sufficient precision to justify its use as a statutory test. The grading is determined by the length of time taken to decolourize the methylene blue and it is suggested that if samples consistently fail to reach grades 1 and 2 it would be reasonable to regard this as an indication of defects in manufacture or handling which warrant further investigation. During the year 15 samples of ice cream were also taken and submitted to the methylene blue test. The results are as follows:- Grade No. of samples 1 9 2 - 3 2 4 4 Premises in the borough where ice cream is manufactured, stored or sold were frequently inspected during the year and generally were found to be in a satisfactory condition, having regard to the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1959. Condensed Milk The Condensed Milk Regulations, 1959, made jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Minister of Health, came into operation on 26th June, 1959. They substantially re-enact in a consolidated and revised form the Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations, 1923/1953. Certain new provisions have been introduced, the principal ones being:- (a) to provide for the sale of condensed partly skimmed (half cream) milk labelled "should not be used for babies except under medical advice" (b) to define half cream milk as meaning milk which contains not less than 10.8% of milk solids including not less than 1.8% of milk fat (c) to prescribe minimum percentages of milk fat and milk solids including fat for condensed partly skimmed (half cream) milk. During the year 20 samples of condensed milk were submitted for analysis and found to comply with the requirements. General There are no abattoirs or slaughterhouses in the borough, and no killing of animals for human consumption is carried out. 70 FOOD POISONING The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, requires any medical practitioner, on becoming aware that a person is suffering or is suspected to be suffering from food poisoning, to notify the Medical Officer of Health. The following table gives a summary of all cases (notified or not) brought to notice during 1962:- Food poisoning notifications (corrected) First quarter 4 Second quarter 5 Third quarter 5 Fourth quarter 4 TOTAL: 18 Cases otherwise ascertained 40 Fatal cases: Nil Particulars of outbreaks:- No. of outbreaks No. of cases Total cases Family Outbreaks Other Outbreaks Notified Otherwise ascertained Agent identified 1 2 3 34 37 Agent unidentified - 1 2 6 8 Single cases:- No. of cases Total cases Notified Otherwise ascertained Agent identified 3 - 3 Agent unidentified 10 — 10 Outbreaks due to identified agent (three outbreaks) Cl. Welchii Nineteen residents of a hostel were affected in the first outbreak, all having partaken of an evening meal which included meat cooked on the previous day and reheated for this meal. Six residents submitted faecal specimens for bacteriological examination, and Cl. welchii was found in all cases. It is presumed that the reheated meat was the source of the outbreak. In the second outbreak fifteen members of the staff of a hospital hostel suffered from diarrhoea with no vomiting. Faecal specimens were submitted for bacteriological examination, and in one case (a food handler) was Cl. welchii isolated. Salmonella bredenay In the third outbreak, two adults (man and wife) were admitted to hospital with high temperature and abdominal upset. Investigations failed to show the source of infection. 71 Outbreak due to unidentified, agent Two adults (male and female) were admitted to hospital within a few hours of eating a meal in a restaurant. Enquiries showed that six people were affected. They had all eaten a meal, the basis of which was tinned turkey (Hungarian). As it was suspected that the cause was a 'blown tin,' a specimen, together with all other ingredients used, was submitted for bacteriological examination, and faecal specimens were also submitted by the food handler. All results were negative. Single cases Thirteen isolated cases of food poisoning were notified. In ten of these, no causative agent was identified, but in the remaining three cases the identified agents were- Salmonella bredenay 2 Salmonella typhimurium 1 INFECTIOUS DISEASE Smallpox No case was notified in the borough during 1962. In connection with outbreaks which occurred at Paddington, Bradford, Birmingham, Cardiff and Dusseldorf, only four known contacts resided in the borough. Surveillance of these was undertaken, and also of contacts working in the borough, for periods up to sixteen days. The Ministry of Health's Memorandum on Vaccination against smallpox recommends that public health officers likely to have to deal with cases of smallpox at short notice should be regularly revaccinated at not more than yearly intervals. During the year 40 members of the staff of the public health department were vaccinated or revaccinated by the Medical Officer of Health. Scarlet Fever The number of cases notified in 1962 was 15. There was no fatal case during the year; in fact, there has been no death from scarlet fever in Kensington since 1940. Diphtheria No case of diphtheria was notified during the year. Enteric Fever During the year two cases of typhoid fever were notified. The first case was a 17-year old Pakistani who arrived in this country and was admitted to hospital fourteen days later as suffering from malaria. Subsequently it was diagnosed that he also had typhoid fever. All contacts remained well and submitted negative specimens. The second case involved an adult female living at a hostel who was admitted to hospital. Enquiries revealed that the patient had consumed shell fish bought at a stall at a South Coast resort. The local Medical Officer of Health was notified and requested to 72 investigate the source of supply, but the particulars given were not sufficient to enable the source of infection to be traced. Specimens submitted by contacts were negative. Puerperal Pyrexia During 1962 the number of cases of this disease notified was 103, of whom 67 were persons normally resident outside Kensington. All but one of these cases occurred in hospital. In order to show some perspective in reviewing the incidence of puerperal pyrexia (defined as any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4°F. or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage), the following table gives an analysis of the causes of pyrexia in the notified cases:- Cause No. of cases Breast infections 16 Respiratory infections:- Upper 9 Lower 1 10 Urinary Infection 27 Pyrexia associated with abnormal delivery:- (a) A.R.M. or Forceps 1 (b) Caesarian section 1 2 Genital tract infections 6 Coryza 5 Influenza 4 Thrombo-Phlebitis 3 Causes unknown after investigation 30 Total: 103 In addition to the above, information was received concerning ^5 patients normally resident in Kensington, who were notified as suffering from puerperal pyrexia in other London districts. No death occurred under this heading. Pneumonia There are various forms of pneumonia, but the only types notifiable are (i) acute primary, and (ii) acute influenzal pneumonia. During the year 20 notifications were received, 12 being acute primary pneumonia and 8 being acute influenzal pneumonia. The number of deaths from pneumonia (all forms) was 109, and the number of deaths from influenza was 13 during 1962. Dysentery Fifty-seven cases of dysentery were notified during 1962, all of which were bacillary in origin, the majority being due to the Sonne bacillus. Generally speaking, the cases were of a mild type and there were no deaths. Eleven of these patients were treated in hospital. Erysipelas Seven cases were notified during the year; six were treated at home, and one was admitted to hospital. There were no deaths. 73 Meningococcal infection No case under this heading was notified during the year. Malaria Three cases of malaria were reported during the year, but investigations showed that the patients had recently arrived from abroad and presumably had contracted infection overseas. Poliomyelitis Three cases of acute poliomyelitis were notified and confirmed during the year; two of the cases showed symptoms of paralysis. There was no death from this disease during the year. The figures for the last eight years are as follows:- Year Confirmed cases Deaths 1955 30 Nil 1956 21 Nil 1957 15 1 1958 ** Nil 1959 8 Nil 1960 3 Nil 1961 7 Nil 1962 3 Nil In addition, there were three suspected cases removed to hospital, where the diagnosis was not confirmed. Contacts of all cases were kept under surveillance for twenty-one days (or until the diagnosis was changed in unconfirmed cases). Kensington residents who were contacts of cases occurring outside the borough were also kept under observation. Evidence that vaccination against poliomyelitis is effective increases every year and a recent report by the World Health Organisation Expert Committee states that "inactivated vaccines have proved to be safe and effective." It is probably true to say that vaccination is slowly and steadily reducing the number of cases all over the world. However, there is no cause for complacency and every effort must be taken to see that the level of protected persons in the borough is raised as high as possible. Acute Encephalitis One case of acute encephalitis was notified during the year. Measles Of the 269 cases notified during 1962, 5 cases were admitted to hospital for treatment. No death occurred during the year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum Three cases were notified during 1962; two were treated at home, and one was admitted to hospital. Information was also received of a baby, born to a Kensington mother outside the borough, who contracted the disease. All the babies recovered without injury to sight. 74 Gastroenteritis This disease is notifiable in children up to the age of five years. The number of cases reported during the year was thirteen. Ten were removed to hospital for treatment. One of the children in hospital died, but the cause of death was recorded as due to bronchopneumonia. Scabies The number of scabies notified during 1962 was 18, which compares with 463 notified in the peak year of 1946. Tuberculosis During the year 160 new cases of tuberculosis were notified, of which 149 were respiratory and 11 non-respiratory. The following table shows the number of cases added to and the number removed from the notification register during the years- Description Respiratory NonRespiratory Total M F M F On register of notifications on 1st January, 1962 737 564 75 102 1,478 Notified for the first time during the year 98 51 4 7 160 Brought to notice other than by notification 52 55 4 2 113 Removed from register on account of having- (a) recovered 38 29 2 4 73 (b) removed from district, lost sight of, etc. 170 110 7 12 299 (c) died 23 - 8 - 31 Remaining on register on 31st December, 1962 656 531 66 95 1,348 The system of investigation into the environmental conditions of tuberculosis patients continued during the year. All newly notified cases and those cases transferring into Kensington or changing their address in the borough, have been visited by the public health inspectors with the object of tracing the source of infection, preventing the spread of infection and removing conditions favourable to infection. Particular attention was given to the home conditions in addition to the dissemination of ad-vice to prevent the transmission of infection to contacts. During the year, 306 visits were paid to the homes of tuberculosis patients. In 138 of these, the environmental conditions were such as to require no further action on the part of the Public Health Department; in a farther 53 cases, it was found that the patients had moved away; and in 76 other cases the investigations were postponed as the patients were away in hospital or had not been contacted by the end of the year. The action taken in the remaining 39 cases is summarised as follows- 75 Action or supervision Cases Investigation or supervision undertaken in respect of:- (a) re-arrangement of existing accommodation 9 (b) occupation of patients 2 (c) tracing of contacts 4 (d) prevention of spread of infection 6 Recommended for priority rehousing 4 Action taken under Public Health and Housing Acts in respect of insanitary or unhealthy conditions 14 Incidence of tuberculosis amongst Kensington residents who originated from areas outside England, Scotland and Wales In my Annual Report for 1951, attention was drawn to what appeared to be a disturbing trend in the incidence of tuberculosis amongst immigrants© Since 1952, a more detailed investigation of this problem has taken place and the following table sets out the information found in 1962:- Country of origin Period (in years) between entry to U. K. and notification of disease.

The total of 229 cases surveyed differs from the total of tuberculosis patients visited in the year. The difference consisted of old cases changing residence within the borough. In 1951, a full survey was not made, but it was estimated that 20 per cent of the tuberculous patients visited for the first time in that year were immigrants who contracted the disease within ten years of arrival in this country. A more accurate investigation in the following years indicated that, of the new cases and "inward transfers" reported in the borough, the proportions who were immigrants contracting the disease in the first ten years of arrival, were as follows:- Year Proportion Per cent. 1952 16 1953 10 1954 16 1955 17 1956 15 1957 16 1958 23 1959 20 I960 20 1961 11 1962 20 This year, 44 per cent. (1961-55 per cent.) of the infected immigrants contracted the disease within one year of arrival in this country; 69 per cent. (1961 - 69 per cent.) contracted it within three years of arrival. Persons born in the Republic of Ireland were regarded as immigrants for this purpose. The 1961 Census figures showed that out of a total Kensington population of 171,272, there were 40,470 residents (or over 23 per cent.) who were born outside the British Isles. Whooping Cough Twenty-two cases were notified during the year, four of which were treated in hospital. No death from this disease was reported. 77 International Certificates In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, certain countries require that visitors should be vaccinated or inoculated against specified diseases. International certificates have been prescribed for smallpox, yellow fever and cholera. When completed by the medical practitioner, the certificates must be authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During the year, 16,938 of these certificates were authenticated in Kensington, whereas in the past a normal yearly figure has been between 3,000-3,500. The increase is doubtless due to the public demand for mass vaccination following the isolated cases of smallpox which had occurred in various parts of the country. In addition, 48 special exemption certificates were issued to travellers for use in Europe and North America. Notifications The following tables show (l) the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year 1962, with comparative figures for the previous seven years; (2) the number of notifications divided into age groups; and (3) the number of cases notified in each ward of the borough.

In 27 cases Abatement Orders were secured and costs amounting to £25.4s.Od. were awarded to the Council. In 22 cases the summonses were withdrawn, the nuisances having been abated prior to the Court hearings. In 23 cases the summonses were adjourned sine die as the necessary works were being carried out by the defendants. Nineteen prosecutions were undertaken for failure to comply with Justices' Orders to abate statutory nuisances. In 10 cases fines totalling £134. 0s. 0d. were imposed and costs amounting to £15. 4s. 6d. were awarded to the Council. In 5 cases the summonses were withdrawn as the work had been completed, and in the remaining 4 cases proceedings were adjourned sine die as the work was in the process of being carried out. London County Council (General Powers) Act. 1954 (Section 12) Three summonses were issued in respect of failure to provide proper dustbin accommodation. In 2 cases convictions were obtained and fines amounting to £4. Os. 0d. and £2. 2s. Od. costs were imposed. The third case was withdrawn as the dustbins had been provided prior to the Court hearing. London County Council Drainage Byelaws Fourteen summonses were issued in respect of contraventions of these Byelaws, which included failure to deposit plans; failure to give notice of intention to commence drainage work; failure to carry out or to maintain drainage work in good condition, etc. Convictions were obtained in 12 cases and fines totalling £11. 0s. 0d. were imposed with £5. 5s. Od. costs. In 2 cases summonses were withdrawn as the defendants had complied with the Byelaws before the Court hearing. London County Council Water Closet Byelaws Thirteen summonses were issued against one defendant for offences under these Byelaws, but were eventually withdrawn as the contraventions were remedied before the Court hearing. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959 (Section 22) Three summonses were issued in respect of unlawfully retaining and using a caravan on vacant land for which a licence was not in force. Two of the summonses were not served as the defendants left without trace. In the third case, however, a conviction was obtained and a fine of 20/was imposed. HOUSING ACT. 1957 Illegal occupation of closed unfit rooms Twelve summonses were issued against landlords or tenants in respect of the illegal occupation of closed rooms. In 9 cases convictions were obtained and fines totalling £32. Os. Od. were imposed and costs of £9. 9s. 0d. were awarded to the Council.
