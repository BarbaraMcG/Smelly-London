Note.— The expenditure of the Assessment Committee for refreshments on one occasion of £10 11s., was unjustifiable, and the Auditors hope that it will not occur again; but taking the whole year through such expenditure has been reasonable. JOHN MILLER, GEORGE WEDLAKE, JAMES J. MUSTO, Auditors. We are of opinion that the sum of £6 l1s., part of the above-mentioned sum of £10 11s., ought to be disallowed. c. McCarthy, J.

LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY & HULL, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1888. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. June. 1888. Gentlemen, In laying before you a statement of the various works carried out by my department during the year, I am pleased to be able to state that some useful and extensive repairs have been executed, as well as a considerable quantity of road paving and channelling, which must tend to improve the sanitary condition of the streets in which these works were performed. Essian-street, Dongola-street, Monteagle-street, and Canal Wharf have been paved and made up at the cost of the owners, under contracts; the amounts expended being as follows:— Essian Street £131 0 0 Dongola Street 96 0 0 Monteagle Street 98 0 0 Canal Wharf 240 2 11 In addition to these works, the following have been done by men in your own employ:— PAVING WORKS. New Paving, squared and laid 3,036 ft. sup. Old do. taken up and relaid 37,012 „ „ Ditto, redressed and relaid 1,685 „ „ New Curb 102 „ „ Old Pitching relaid 2,893 yards. Old Curb relaid 4,342 ft. run. Old Channel relaid 353 „ „ New Tees Scoriae Brick Channel laid 20,693 „ „ The cost of these works was for labour £611 4 4 „ „ „ material 1320 8 11 The paving of a portion of the Commercial-road, extending from the Eastern Boundary to Arbour-street East, has been taken up, redressed and relaid at a cost of £741. 44 Union-street and a part of Sidney-street have been repaved at a cost of £,1,201 12s. 1d. Experimental pieces of Tees Scoriae Blocks have been laid throughout the whole of the roadway of Myrdle-street, and for a length of about 100 feet on Stepney-green, the condition with the Company supplying these being, that unless they remain in a satisfactory state after 12 months wear they are to be removed at the company's cost, payment being deferred for that period. Footpaths in the following streets have been repaired under contract, viz—Sidney-street, Charles-street, Heath-street, St. Paul'sroad, Rhodeswell-road, Turner-street, and Settle street; the estimated cost of which is £1,520. ROAD REPAIRS. The following table will shew the quantity of material used on the various roads. Year ending March, 1886 Year ending March, 1887 Year ending March, 1888. Yards. £ s. d Yards. f s. d.

The quantity of refuse collected from houses by your carts and men during the year was 18,902 loads, being 1,511 loads more than were collected in 1886-7. and 3,916 more than in the year 1885-6. 1886. 1887. 1888. a s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.

DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The quantity of Ashes sifted and put on rail was 5,293 tons, and at the wharf 3,932 were loaded into barges and sent to shoot, while there were loaded 1,380 tons into barges and sold for brick making purposes. The total cost of disposing of the Refuse was as follows :— Carriage and other disposal of refuse £g76 7 0 Sifting and loading 597 6 9 Rent of Wharf 90 0 0 Rent of Arch ... ... ... ... ... 10 0 0 £167313 9 Owing to the manner in which I have been enabled to dispose of a large quantity of the Refuse this year, it has resulted in a saving of £184. The amount receivable for sifted material was £192 11S> 8d., and for the removal of trade refuse £22 16s. DISPOSAL OF STREET REFUSE. 1886 1887. 1888. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d. Carpenters Co.

HORSE-KEEPING. The cost of keeping the Vestry's horses for the year was ^"2.964 16s. id., made up as follows:— Rent of Stables £132 0 0 Wages 273 6 11 Superintendent's salary 200 0 0 Corn 498 3 9 Hay, Straw and Clover 988 11 10 Green-meat 49 10 6 Shoeing and Veterinary attendance 109 4 6 Repairs to Harness 90 4 8 Depreciation on Stock 390 15 0 Kates, I axes, Coals, Gas, Water, &c. 121 13 7 Stock on hand 1887, Corn, &c.123 8 3 2976 19 0 Less amounts received for dead horses, &c. 12 211 £2964 16 1 47 The work done was equal to 10,242 working days for one horse at 5s. 10d. per day. This year's working shews a saving in the price per day this is owing to the fact that you have kept a larger number of horses and therefore all the Establishment and general charges are distributed among a greater number of working days. The time was divided as follows :— 1382 days for drawing materials for road repairs. 3326 „ carting street refuse. 4268 „ „ house refuse. 1266 „ watering roads. 10,242 LIGHTING. The Public Lamps, 939 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted and cleaned by the Commercial Gas Co., at a cost of £3,452 19s. 9d. SEWERS. The cost of labour for cleansing sewers and gullies, and other matters chargeable to sewers, has been £441 5s. 8d., as against £629 7s. 1d. in the previous year, being much less than in preceding years owing to the fact that a rigid watch has been kept upon the scavengers to prevent the sweeping of slop into the gullies. It will thus be seen that while the scavenging has not increased, a sum of nearly £100 has been saved on the cost of cleansing the sewers. Small works of construction and repairs to sewers, including cleansing and relaying pipe sewers have been carried out at a cost of £564 12s., including 19 new gullies. During the year 56 houses have been connected with the sewers of the Hamlet. The quantity of material removed from the sewers was 109 yards, and from the gullies 373 yards cube. The condition of sewers in Commercial Road between Jamaica Street and Bedford Street is such as to cause the greatest uneasiness to the Sanitary authorities, owing to the diversion of a quantity of water which formerly came through this sewer, it is deprived of all the flushing power which it previously had. I have made repeated representations to the officers of the St. George's Vestry, with a view to adjoint re-construction of the sewer for its entire length, but have failed to obtain any satisfactory arrangement; it is therefore wirh considerable reluctance that I have been compelled to advise you to ask the Metropolitan Board of Works to make an order under their powers. 48 STEAM ROLLER.

VESTRY OF THE Danlet of with End Old down. ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1887—8, BY THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: Printed by Penny and Hull, Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1888. THE THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1887—8. TO THE VESTRY OF THE HAMLET OF MILE END OLD TOWN. Gentlemen, I beg to submit for your perusal my Annual Report of the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Work carried out during the last twelve months. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The total births registered during the year numbered 4,034, an increase of 6 upon the previous year. Taking the population at 113,000, which is based on the assumption that the increase of the population has been the same as during the decade of 1871 to 1881; 4,034 births give a birth-rate of 3 5.6 per 1000. The following Table shews the number of births registered in each vear for the last ten vears. Year. No. of Births. Year. No. of Births. 1878-79 4298 1883-4 4147 1879-80 4242 1884-5 4065 1880-81 4117 1885-6 40 10 1881-82 4141 1886-7 4028 1882-83 4248 1887-8 4034 DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The deaths from all causes belonging to Mile End Old Town that have occurred during the last twelve months were 2,330, giving a deathrate of 20.6 per 1000, this is after making proper allowance for the mortality that takes place in public Institutions outside the District which were admitted from Mile End; and also the deaths which too place in public Institutions inside the district, which do not belong to this Hamlet. 52 The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 19.9 per 1000 and in the twenty-seven large provincial towns 21.6 per 1000. Quarter ending Mile End. London. 27 Provincial Towns. 1887. June 17.0 18.0 21.3 September 23.3 19.6 21.1 December 19.4 20.0 22.0 1888. March 22.6 22.0 22.2 Total 82.3 79.6 86.6 Average for the Year 20.6 19.9 21.6 This increase in the death-rate of .7 more than that for the whole of London, and 1.6 more than the death-rate for Mile End for the year 1886-87, is due to a great extent to the heavy mortality from Infantine disease and Whooping Cough. 204 deaths took place from this disease as against 49 the previous year, whilst 638 children died under one year of age as against 574 the year previous. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. It will readily be understood that it is with the deaths from these diseases that we are particularly interested, and strive to do all we can to prevent their spread and so lessen the mortality arising therefrom. The following Table shows the deaths from these diseases in the four quarters of the year. Quarter ending June, 1887. Quarter ending Oct., 1887, Quarter ending Dec., 1887. ' Quarter ending Mar., 1888. Total.

During the year there has been only one death from Small Pox. We had six cases altogether notified to us in various parts of the Hamlet; the majority were promptly removed to the Hospital Ships, and the rooms which they had occupied were thoroughly disinfected. We were able in several of the cases to trace the source of contagion, and measures were taken to prevent its spread. Happily, there did not occur a second case to any of the houses. It is much to be desired that the Asylums Board may be able to maintain the Ships and excellent arrangements for the transfer of patients, instead of having recourse to the inland Hospitals which were undoubted centres of infection to the surrounding neighbourhood. MEASLES. The total number of deaths registered, due to this disease, is 55 ; last year there were 112 cases. SCARLET FEVER. During the past year, in almost every district of London, there has been an epidemic of this disease, in fact, at several periods it spread with such rapidity as to tax the resources of the Asylums Board's Hospitals severe'y; but, thanks to their admirable management, they were able to treat all the cases sent to them. We may congratulate ourselves that we have such an excellent body as the Asylums Board to fall back upon, or, I feel sure, the consequence of lack of isolation would be most disastrous in our crowded locality. The deaths resulting from this disease in our district were 58, this was a very small proportion of the number of cases affected. We had something like 237 notified to us by the various authorities, and in each case, disinfection was carried out and every means taken to prevent its spread. The disease was not confined to one locality but was general all over the Hamlet. I am pleased to say there were only a very few of the houses in which there was a second case after disinfection had been carried out. WHOOPING COUGH. The mortality from this infantile disease was very great during the last year and more so during the six months ending March, 1888, and, as will be seen from the Table of Zymotic Diseases. In a populous district like Mile End, where isolation cannot be practised, it is scarcely to be wondered at when once it makes its appearance how difficult it is to prevent its spread, and how great the mortality from diseases of the chest which Whooping-cough is the primary cause. DIPHTHERIA. This disease has caused 22 deaths. If these cases could be isolated, I am of opinion that the mortality would be lessened. It is much to be regretted that there is no public Institution in which such cases are received, and from the fact that it is highly contagious, I think the matter should be brought under the notice of the Asylums Board. 54 TYPHOID FEVER. The number of deaths were 30 from this disease. This is a very small number; there is little doubt that the many sanitary improvements that have been carried out during the last few years account for the low rate of mortality. We had 37 cases notified to us from various sources. In some the disease could be traced to defective drainage ; most of the localities were visited and means taken to prevent its spread. DIARRHCEA. The mortality from Diarrhoea was 151. 136 of these cases occurred between July and September, no doubt caused, to a great extent, by the hot weather and the eating of unsound fruit. VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. During the past year the system of notification of Infectious diseases by medical men has worked very well. Something like 111 cases have been notified to us, which has been a great help, principally in shewing us the locality of the diseases, and by that means we are enabled to take measures to prevent its spread, and also to disinfect the rooms, bedding, etc., when necessary. I hope in the near future all the medical men in the district will feel it their duty to notify to us the cases which come under their notice. In my last Report 1 expressed a hope that the compulsory notification of Infectious diseases would be in force before long. During the last year this important subject has come very much to the fore, and there is now a Bill before the House of Commons to secure notification and other powers. There seems to be a rather divided opinion whether the notification should come from the medical man or the householder, or both ; however that may be, the principal of acquiring early information is a sound one, and will be of great utility in preventing the spread of these diseases. There are already some fifty Towns in England which have local powers for notification, and this is found to be very beneficial in lessening the mortality of the district. HOUSES PLACED UNDER THE ARTIZANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS ACT, 1868. Under the provisions of this Act I have reported to the Vestry during the last twelve months the following houses :—Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, Philpot Street, Nos. 62, 63, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89, Greenfield Street. I hey were in a condition dangerous to health and unfit for human habitation. I recommended the usual proceedings to be taken under the Act. In 62 and 63, Greenfield Street, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, Philpot Street, the work was completed under the supervision of your Surveyor. I he works at the houses Nos. 85 to 89, Greenfield Street, I regret to say, have not as yet been completed although they were the most unsanitary of the whole. The ventilation has been impeded by the erection ot a number of workshops occupied by foreigners whose habits are far from cleanly, and I trust that your Board will insist on these orders being carried out in their entirety. 55 SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND COW-HOUSES. There are 19 Slaughter-houses and 45 Cow-houses in the district. All these have been repeatedly visited during the year and found to be in such a cleanly condition that no opposition to the renewal of the licenses was made. SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS. The following are some of the Sanitary Improvements that have been carried out during the year:— Water-supply provided to closets 1306 Yards that have been paved and repaired 608 Dust receptacles provided 747 Traps provided to sinks 181 Houses cleansed 76 Drains cleansed 195 Houses disinfected 294 Houses inspected 2119 There are many improvements which have been carried out other than those mentioned, that necessarily present themselves in a large and thickly populated district like ours, and which absorb much of the time and attention of the Inspectors. The house to house inspection has been continued in both the Eastern and Western districts, and many Sanitary improvements have been effected. From the above Table will be seen the various works done, and although there are not so many as last year, it must be borne in mind that we are now coming to better class houses, many of which are in a good sanitary state, but, nevertheless, have to be inspected. We have now been through the streets that are most thickly populated in the Hamlet and the remainder are being taken in hand. In order to get the necessary works completed, it entails far more work than one would at first imagine, and the fact that so much has been done shows that the Inspectors have not been idle. HOUSES UNDER THE LODGING HOUSE ACT. There are 56 houses under this Act in the Hamlet ; these have been visited from time to time during the past year and their sanitary condition attended to. I have not been made aware of any outbreak of any Infectious disease occurring in them since my last report. EGGS UNFIT FOR FOOD. Your Sanitary Sub-Inspector seized about 20,000 Eggs which he suspected were unfit for human food ; after inspecting them I quite concurred, and they were at once taken before a Magistrate, who condemned them. It is much to be regretted that eggs are not mentioned as food in the Act (26 and 27 Vict., cap. 117), that being the case we did not press for a prosecution. Had it not been for the vigilance of your Sub-Inspector these Eggs would, in all probability have been sold to the small shopkeepers in the neighbourhood, and by that means been consumed and spread contagion, 56 as most of them were in a putrid condition. In my opinion some representation should be made to the Local Government Board to get Eggs included in 117 Sec. of the Nuisances Removal Act. CLOTHING DISINFECTION. For some years past the Vestry have been in the habit of having the bedding, &c., belonging to Fever cases disinfected by means of the drying oven belonging to the Board of Guardians. Latterly, however, that body gave the Vestry notice to discontinue using it, as they, not unnaturally, thought the infection might be carried to their own buildings ; whereupon the Vestry decided to have an Oven for that purpose, of their own, which is now in working order. The number of articles of bedding and clothing that have been disinfected away from the houses was 666. In concluding this, my Second Annual Report, I may say that the many Sanitary improvements that have been carried out during the last few years have done much to add to the comfort and longevity of the inhabitants, and taking the Sanitary condition of Mile End as a whole, it compares favourably with other such populous districts. 1 have to thank the No. 3 Committee and Vestry for their courtesy and kindness during the past year, and trust that the same harmony and goodwill may continue. I am, Yours obediently, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health.
