Of these births, 161 were males and 171 females. The Birth-Rate for the district was therefore 12.6 per 1000 of the population, but the correcting factor for age and sex distribution is 1.03 and this gives a Birth-Rate for comparative purposes of 12.9. The corresponding Birth-Rate for England & Weles was 15.5 and for London 17.8. Births and Birth-Rates for the past five years have been as follow:- Year. No. of Births. Friern Barnet. Birth-Rates. England & Wales. London. 1947 510 19.0 20.5 22.7 1948 375 14.1 17.9 20.1 1949 388 14.4 16.7 18.5 1950 397 15.3 15.8 17. 8 1951 332 12. 9 15.5 17.8 DEATHS. The number of deaths during the year was 287, but since the preparation of the Death-Table, the Registrar General has assigned only 284 of these deaths to the district, and this gives an uncorrected Death-Rate of 10.8 per 1000. The correcting factor for age and sex distribution is 0.98, and this gives a corrected Death-Rate for comparative purposes of 10.5 per 1000. The corresponding Death-Rate for England & Wales was 12.5 and for London 13.1. The total number of deaths was 17 higher than the preceding year, 133 wore roles and 145 females. 183 deaths (64%) were of persons above the age of 65. The chief causes of death at all ages were again Heart Disease and Cancer. Table 5 on page 21 provides a detailed analysis of the causes of death. -5- The Deaths ana Death-Rates for the past rive years have been:- Year. No. of Deaths. Friern Barnet. Death-Rates.

The comparative rates for England & Wales and for London were 29.6 and 26.4 respectively. Of the 10 infant deaths 6 occurred during the first week of life, AREA HEALTH SERVICES. The provisions of the National Health Service Act relating to the core of expectant and nursing mothers and young children, the domiciliary midwifery service, the health visiting service, the home nursing service, arrangements for vaccination and immunisation, the ambulance service, the arrangements for the prevention of illness, care and aftercare, and the domestic help service, are administered by the Middlesex Ceunty Council as the Local Health Authority. The County is divided into ten areas with an Area Health Committee for each area. This district is included in Area Ho.2, together with the districts of Wood Green, Southgate and Potters Bar, The Council has been represented on the Area Health Committee by Councillor A.C. Henry (Chairman of the Public Health Committee) and by Councillor J. Feley, LABORATORY SERVICES. Laboratory facilities are provided by the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, and the Laboratory, Coppetts Wood Hospital, Coppetts Road, N. 10. Both laboratories are directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health. The Public Health Department is a collecting centre for specimens, which are called for by the Laboratory Service at 2 p.m. on weekdays and at 10 a.m. on Saturdays. -6- The following specimens were examined during the year:- Throat or Nose - 66 Faeces - 78 Sputum - 23 Pertussis - 7 Ice-Cream - 39 Miscellaneous - 23 SANITARY SERVICES. Under this heading may be grouped those services for which the Council through the Public Health Committee and Public Health Department are directly responsible, including such matters as housing (in its relation to health) food inspection and hygiene, the sanitary conditions in shops and factories, rodent control, the investigation and control of infectious disease, and the investigation and improvement of conditions which are likely in any way to affect the health of the community, SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS. Visits to premises on complaint 545 Visits in connection with infectious disease 80 Visits to shops and places where food is prepared,stored or sold 344 Visits to other shops 98 Visits to factories 82 Visits to Petroleum installations 59 Visits in connection with housing and the repair of dwelling-houses 1771 Appointments and special visits 383 Visits re infestation and disinfcstation 16 Visits in connection with rodent control 1505 Visits to piggeries 27 Attendances at Court 4 SERVICE OF NOTICES. Number of informal notices served 267 Number of informal notices complied with 202 Number of statutory notices served 35 Number of statutory notices complied with 26 HOUSING INSPECTION AND REPAIRS. As in previous years the inspection and repair of dwelling-houses have taken an important place in the work of the Department. The main object has been to maintain a reasonable standard of fitness of the older properties whilst a general raising of the standard of accommodation is brought about by the provision of new houses. This has been no simple task. The problems associated with old and worn-out properties persist and are too well known to need restating, whilst economic factors have resulted in more and more of the better type of property coming into the field of action by the Department, -7- Many of the defects which here been dealt with were brought to our notice by key of complaint, whilst others were noted during the coarse of the inspections which are carried out continuously. Others were noted from statements contained in housing applications. As a result of the action taken, informal and formal, extensive repairs were carried out to 128 houses, whilst in numerous other premises specific defects were remedied.

Particular effort was directed towards obtaining a satisfactory standard of premises and equipment. Wherever methods were found to be in any way of doubtful quality the faults were pointed out and explained to those concerned and advice was offered as to correct practice. To a considerable extent our part has been advisory and wo have endeavoured to gain the willing co-operation of the food traders and their staffs. In general this approach to the subject has been well justified and in but few instances was it necessary to issue warnings that failure to provide and maintain a proper standard of food hygiene would not be tolerated. The Council have made byelaws under section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act 1938, dealing with cleanly practices in the handling of food, and these came into force in the district on tho 3rd. July, 1950. A copy of those byelaws was supplied to each food establishment and to all traders distributing food in the district. No legal proceedings wore necessary. Some 344 visits were made to the various food establishments and it was noted that in many considerable improvements hod been carried out. A better supply of equipment and on improvement in the building licence position has made it possible for long outstanding repairs and replacements to be effected, and it is hoped that this progress will continue. In other instances the occupiers were required to carry out works to improve the quality of their promises, or to provide better facilities or equipment. The more frequent demands were for improved washing facilities and food storage accomodation. FOOD INSPECTION. No slaughtering of animals for sale for human consumption was carried out in the district during the year. The following foodstuffs were examined at the various stores and shops and condemned as unfit for human consmmption, Beef 260 lbs. Lamb 15 lbs. Liver 12 lbs. Bacon/Ham 191 lbs. Kidney and Suet 24 lbs. Chickens/Turkeys 100 lbs. Fish 231 lbs. Herring Roes 24 lbs. Sweets 7 lbs. Pickles 1 jar. Lemon Curd 3 jars. Tinned Corned Beef/Mutton 7 tins. " Meat/Ham 87 tins. " Vegetables 40 tins. " Milk 19 tins. " Fish 93 tins. -9- Tinned Fruit 283 tins. " Fruit Juice 20 tins. " Soup 11 tins. " Sausages 14 tins. " Jam/Marmaladc 26 tins. " Paste 1 tin. FOOD HAWKERS. By the Middlesex County Council Act 1950, it is necessary for any person wishing to sell food from, a vehicle, cart, borrow &C, to be registered by the local Authority, and the premises used for tho storage of the food must also bo registered. Such traders are subject to the provisions of the Food end Drugs. Act and to the byelaws relating to the handling of food as any other food trader, but the requirement as to registration gives further control over this class of trader as the local authority can refuse to register if the public health is or is likely to be endangered by any act or default of the person in relation to the quality, storage or distribution of the food, or if the storage promises are unsuitable. Because of their mobility supervision of this type of trader has obvious difficulties, but the majority of those operating in this district work on established rounds and no serious problem exists. The following now registrations were approved during they year:- Person. Premises. Fish 2 — Groceries 1 - Ice-cream 1 - The total number of registrations at the end of the year was:- Persons. Premises. Fruit & Vegetables. 10 8 Fish 3 - Groceries 1 - Ice-cream 1 " ICE-CREAM. Certificates of registration for the sale of ice-cream were granted in respect of 4 premises during the year, making a total of 49 premises now registered for the manufacture, storage, or sale of ice-cream in the district. Inspections of these premises waremade to ensure that the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act and the Ice Cream (Heat treatment &c) Regulations wore observed. Where ice-cream was sold from vehicles these were examined for suitability, The motor vehicle appears to be replacing the tricycle, and this is e good thing -10- as the motor vehicle can be readily equipped with a hot water supply and facilities for personal washing and the cleansing of utensils. There has been a definite improvement in the standard of this type of vehicle. Thirty-nine samples of ice-cream of thirteen different makes were submitted to bacteriological examination. The results were as follow:- Grade1. Grade 2. Grade 3. Grade 4. 38 1 - FOOD POISONING. Two cases only were notified during the course of the year. Both patients made a satisfactory and speedy recovery. In neither case was the causative agent traced. By the Food and Drugs Act 1938 a medical practitioner is required to notify the medical officer of health should he be aware or suspect that a patient is suffering from food poisoning. Immediate notification provides information of outbreaks of sickness occurring in a district and believed to have been caused by food, and enables prompt inquiry and action to be taken to prevent the spread of infection, MILK SUPPLY. The district is in en area in which, by reason of an Order made by the Minister of Food, all milk sold by retail must be either sterilised, pasteurised, tuberculintested or accredited. Legislation dealing with milk production and distribution was amended in 1949. As a result the supervision of milk production at the farm is the responsibility of the Minister of agriculture and Fisheries. Local authorities arc responsible for the supervision of milk distribution within their areas, for the registration of milk distributors and dairies, and for the granting of licences to retail milk. The licensing of pasteurising and sterilising establishments is carried out by the food and Drugs Authority, which for middle sex is the County Council. The following licences wore issued during the year- Dealers' Licences. Supplementary Licenccs. Pasteurised milk 3 8 Sterilised Milk 11 8 Tuberculin-Tested Milk 4 9 There were 18 companies or persons registered as distributors of milk within the district, and one dairy engaged in the pasteurising and bottling of milk, -11- WATER SUPPLY. Water is supplied by the Barret District water Company and is obtained from deep walls sunk into the chalk. The supply has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. Bacteriological and chemical examinations of the water ore carried out at regular intervals, and the following is characteristic of reports received:- "This is a very satisfactory water. It is clear and bright in appearance and of the highest standard of bacterial purity, indicative of a pure and wholesome water suitable for the purpose of a public supply," All the houses in the district have a piped supply, and the few complaints of unsatisfactory or insufficient supply have been in respect of domestic store cisterns in need of cleansing and of supplies shut off on account of burst pipes. PESTS AND VERMIN. The Prevention of Damage by Posts Act 1949 places an obligation on local Authorities to ensure that, as far as practicable, their areas are kept free of rats and mice. This obligation does not relieve individual house-holders from their responsibility to destroy rats and mice on their own premises, but their presence may well bo indicative of a general infestation in the locality and it is advantageous for the investigations and treatments to bo carried out by a skilled operator under single direction. The Council provide a free service for the treatment of private dwelling-houses, where the infestation does not arise through any act or neglect by the occupier, but for all other treatments a charge is made. Effective control calls for the treatment of reported sources of infestation and for regular and systematic examination of premises and land for infestations previously unknown or unreported, and also for the treatment of sewers, a common source of infestation. During the year 396 premises were examined, and infestations were found and treated in 216 instances. The Sewage Works, Depots, Parks and various open spaces were regularly visited, and treatments were carried out where nd when found to be necessary. Two treatments of the sewers were carried out, the number of manholes shewing the presence of rats being 30 and 17 respectively. When these sewer treatments were commenced in 1947, 53 manholes ware found to bo infested. As a result of these various treatments it is estimated that some 1715 rots ware destroyed. A further 42 premises were treated against mice, A total of 1481 visits ware made by the rodent operator, -12- No legal proceedings were taken under the Act. Evidence suggesting the presence of foxes was found during investigations of rat infestations in the North Ward, and later occupiers of houses in the area reported that a fox had been soon. Information was passed to the County Pest Officer, Middlesex County Agricultural Executive Committee and a vixen and cubs were token. Only five premises were found to be infested with bed-bugs, and all were successfully treated. The verminous house is not the problem it used to be. Infestations are not so numerous nor are individual cases so severe. The explanation probably lies in use of the improved insecticides and in a better appreciation that such vermin need not be tolerated. Twenty-three wasp nests were destroyed, for the most part in situations where they were causing concern to users of the public footpaths. The Department received numerous requests for advice and assistance in connection with other infestations including ants, furniture beetle, moth, and the many types of insect infesting foodstuffs or invading the home. FACTORIES ACT 1937. The Council administer certain of the provisions of this Act, mainly relating to health. These provisions deal with cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, drainage of floors. And sanitary conveniences. With regard to factories where no mechanica1 power is used the Council enforces all these provisions, but where mechanical power is used the Council's responsibility is limited to securing the provision of adequate sanitary conveniences, the remainder being enforced by H, K. Inspectors of Factories, who dea1 also with the many other provisions of the Act relating to safety and welfare. The Council also have the duty of ensuring that certain classes of factory are provided with sufficient means of escape in case of fire and of issuing certificates to that effect. There are 76 factories of various types and sizes in the district and at page 16 is a table showing the inspections made during the year. The Act requires occupiers of factories to forward to the Council, twice yearly, a list of outworkers employed in specified classes of work, and this information enables control to be exercised over work carried out in unsatisfactory promises or in conditions likely to load to the spread of infection. Notification was received of 53 outworkers who were engaged in the following occupations -13- Wearing Apparel - 47 Box Making - 2 Brush Making - 2 Feather Sorting - 2 In no case was it necessary to restrict work on account of infectious disease. NATIONAL ASSITANCE ACT. 1948. Section 47. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. No formal action was taken under this Section whereby the Council are enabled to secure the removal to suitable accommodation of persons who being aged, infirm, or suffering from chronic disease are living in insanitary conditions and are unable to devote to themselves and are not receiving from other persons proper care and attention. Five cases were investigated in which elderly persons were found to be living under unsatisfactory circumstances and arrangements were made for them to be admitted to hospitals and nursing homes. Section 50. Burial or Cremation of the dead. No action was necessary under this section by which it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead and it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been made. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Table 1 on page 17 of this Report gives details of all cases of infectious disease notified during 1951. The total of 497 is lower than in the previous year595, and the decrease is explained by a fell in the number of cases of Whooping Cough end Scarlet Fever. The infectious sickness rate- was 17.4 as compared with 20.3 in 1950. Measles. The number of cases notified was only slightly lower than in 1950 - 317 as compared with 327. The type of disease was mild, admission to hospital being necessary only in 6 cases. Whooping Cough. There was a substantial drop in the . number of notifications of this disease - 91 being notified as against 150 in the previous year. In 3 cases only was hospital treatment necessary. A scheme for immunisation against whooping cough either alone or in conjunction with diphtheria immunisation is undertaken by the County Council. -14- Scarlet Fever. Notifications daring the near fall from 40 to 24. The type of disease continued very mild and admission to hospital was required only in 11 cases. Poliomyelitis. 3 cases were reported during the year 2males aged 5 and 3 years respectively, and a female aged 19 years. The latter was not normally resident in the district and was apparently incubating the disease when she came to stay here with relatives. Tuberculosis. The number of new cases of Tuberculosis during 1951 was 29 - 27 pulmonary and 2 non-pulmonary. In addition 13 persons who had previously been notified in other districts took up residence in this district. The total number of cases added to the Register was less by 13 than in the previous year. During the first week of November, by arrangement with the North West Regional Hospital Board, a Mobile Mass X-Ray Unit visited the district. The various sessions arranged for organised groups from factories, shops &c, and the general public were well attended and a total of 2198 persons were X-Rayed. Typhoid Fever. The 6 cases occurred in the Friern Hospital Diphtheria. For the third successive year no case of Diphtheria occurred in the district. There is no doubt that the remarkable decline in the incidence of this disease throughout the country is due to immunisation, but the continuance of this very satisfactory position must depend on continued support of the immunisation programme. During the year 3-50 children were immunised against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough - 224 at the Clinics organised by the County Council, and 126 by their own medical attendants. In addition, 182 children of school age received re-inforcing injections against Diphtheria. -15- REPORT 0F MEDICAL OFFICER REQUIRED BY SECTION 128 (3) OF THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937. 1.
