1863-4 ST. GILES, CAMBEBWELL, SURREY, Bighth Annual Report OF THE VESTRY OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120. london: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, BY E. BILLING & SON, COTTAGE GREEK 1864. EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them. And an Account of their Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending the 25th March, 1864. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. 1863-4. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, The Annual Statement of Works and other matters appertaining to my department during the year ending 25th March last, is as follows:— GENERAL PURPOSES. HIGHWAYS. The general matters of the public Roads and footpaths under your control, do not require any 4 particular notice in this report, except to afford me the opportunity to express a hope that their condition is such as merits your satisfaction. It may be considered necessary that I should explain why the Ward kirbing has not been proceeded with more rapidly, it arises from the fact, that the demand upon the Stone market for the particular sort of kirbing which we most generally use in this Parish, exceeded the possibility of supply within the allotted time, hence the somewhat tardy execution of the Yestry's order in this respect. But as this is only a question of time, the whole will be executed progressively, and each particular Ward will eventually receive its due share, and will participate in the consequent improvement which Kirbing affords. NEW STREETS. In last year's report I anticipated many "New Streets" which had been directed by the Vestry to be taken into the public care, under the provisions of the Metropolitan Local Management Amendment Act ; I now enumerate such as have been 5 completed up to the period embraced in this Report, viz.:— Length. Stafford street, Peckham 200 yards. Winchester place, ditto 110 „ D'Eynsford road, Camberwell green 277 „ Harvey road, ditto 127 „ Kimpton road, ditto 180 „ Brook's place, ditto 84 „ Artichoke row &. Artichoke place, do. 84 „ Marlborough, road, Old Kent road 294 „ Marlborough road, Peckham 183 „ Green Hundred road, ditto 127 „ Downes street, ditto 286 „ Lothian road, Camberwell new road 366 „ Langton road, ditto 133 „ Bishops road, ditto 77 ,, James street, ditto 177 „ 2705 „ making nearly 1¾ miles of "New Roads," added to those previously under the public control. 6 At this time there are several other Roads of a similar character to the above, with reference to which the necessary proceedings are being taken to enable the Vestry to undertake their repair. I may mention that the above form but a small portion of Roads of a like character which require the intervention of the vestry to put them into a creditable condition, but proceedings have been stayed for the present (except in extreme cases) on account of the proposed Local Sewerage of the parish, shortly to be put in hand, to avoid the necessity of a second repair to such Roads after the Sewers shall have been completed; it has for this reason, therefore, been deemed prudent not to enforce further Road repairs in thoroughfares which are at present un-Sewered. STREET NOMENCLATURE, &c. The re-numbering of such Streets and Roads in this Parish as require revision— the affixing Street Tablets— the consideration of lines of frontage questions— new streets to be formed, and many 7 other matters referred from time to time to the Vestry by the Metropolitan Board of Works, having now become the ordinary duty of the vestry, I need not further remark upon them. The Streets and Roads re-numbered during the past year, are,— Old Kent Road, Camberwell Road, Church Street, New Church Road, Southampton Street. RAILWAYS. Those now in progress of execution are the London and Brighton, from Barrington road, Brixton, to and crossing the Kent road, on its course to London Bridge, and The Crystal Palace Line from out of the above (at Cow lane, Peckham,) passing through Forest 8 hill and Dulwich College estate, at Sydenham Common, fronting the Palace. These two Lines it is expected will be completed about May, 1865. Another Line, promoted by the London and Brighton Company, was passed during the late session; its route, as I have already reported to you, is from out of the Line first above mentioned, at Lyndhurst road, Peckham, crossing Grove vale (or Dog Kennel lane), thence to Dulwich, under Red-Post hill, near to, and over Half-Moon lane, which latter roadway it has been arranged, between the Yestry and the Company, shall be raised for that purpose, from thence this Line will proceed to join the Mitcham and Tooting Line, about to be commenced at or near Norwood lane and Tulse hill. 9 LIGHTING. The Public Lamps of the Parish are as follows :— Lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company 1254 Ditto Phoenix Gas Company 70 Ditto Crystal Palace Gas Company 57 Total 1381 Additional Lamps erected this year 31 Removals 43 SEWERS. The Sewers works executed by this Vestry during the past year, are as follows:— BRICK SEWERS. PIPE SEWERS. 8376.0. 5460. = 2½ Miles of Brick and Pipe Sewers. The above includes 1520 feet of open Sewer arched over. 10 HOUSE DRAINAGE. No. of Houses permanently Drained. No. of Houses temporarily Drained. 632 369 Total 1001 Houses. MAIN DRAINAGE WORKS. SOUTHERN HIGH LEVEL SEWERS. I stated in the last report that these Sewers were completed,— They are now being made available for House Drainage in their several localities, and no time has been lost by your Sewers Committee in appropriating them for the local wants of the Parish on the High ground. A loan has been obtained for this purpose, and when the 11 period arrives for another report, I shall by that time be enabled to enumerate the localities which have received this first benefit from the Metropolitan Main Drainage Works. THE EXECUTION OF THE SOUTHERN LOW LEVEL DRAINAGE Is also fast progressing through the parish.— With a view to take early advantage of this work, yon will recollect I asked permission of this Vestry to be allowed to anticipate the period when we shall be permitted to use this Sewer also. This long looked for work will soon become an accomplished fact, and I hope soon to be enabled to supply such information as will enable you to direct that funds be provided for the purpose of proceeding with the Local Low Level Drainage of the Parish. The present total length of Sewers under your control is,— Brick Sewers 17f Miles. Pipe do 9 ,, Open do 7 ,, Total 331 Miles. 12 These memoranda, Gentlemen, collated for your information, I beg to lay before you, promising that next year's works, and also each successive one for some time to come, must of necessity be more and more important as regards the Sanitary condition and general improvement of our Parish. That improvements to a great extent have taken place under the new system, is I venture to assert apparent on the surface of our thoroughfares, below ground the result of the labour and expense which has been gone to, must be sought for in the improved condition of our House drainage, Water supply, and other sanitary appliances, which recent legislature has provided for, and if a retrospective glance be permitted at the original extent of those fruitful sources of evil, viz.: open and foul watercourses, which this Yestry has caused to be annihilated during the last few years, to the extent of some miles, (and the few remaining ones I predict are doomed to a similar and I hope speedy fate, by reason of the works of sewerage soon about to be undertaken in this vicinity;) you may I think take credit that the powers entrusted to you have been efficiently administered, and that the past 13 may be accepted as an earnest of a zealous future in the same direction. Your faithful and obedient Servant, J. C. EEYNOLDS, Surveyor. Office of Works, Wells Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell. 1863-4. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. ANNUAL REPORT by J. S. Bristowe, M.D., Lond., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Physician to St. Thomas's Hospital Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, During the year 1863, 1731 deaths were registered in the parish of Camberwell. Of these 873 were of males. 858 of females; 22 took place in the sub-district of Dulwich, 450 in that of St. George's, 560 in that of Camberwell and 699 in that of Peckham. But of the 560 assigned to the Camberwell subdistrict, 67 occurred in the Lunatic asylums and 102 in the Workhouse. The numbers of deaths at different ages were as follows:— 726 between birth and 5 years, 94 between 5 and 10, 40 between 10 and 15, 47 between 15 and 20, 103 between 20 and 30, 92 between 30 and 40, 120 between 40 and 50, 125 between 50 and 60, 169 between 60 and 70, and 215 from 70 upwards. The deaths may be thus arranged in respect of their causes:— 135 were due to "violence, privation, poison, or premature birth," 13 to "dysentery, or acute diarrhoea (not of infants) 169 to "diarrhoea, bronchitis, or pneumonia of infants under 3 years of age;" 165 to "hydrocephalus or convulsions of infancy;" 240 to "phthisis or other tubercular diseases;" 41 to "fever;" 14 to "small-pox;" 124 to " scarlet fever;" 29 18 to "diphtheria;" 32 to "measles;" 57 to "hooping cough;" 34 to "croup;" 2 4 to "erysipelas or puerperal fever;" and 654 to other diseases, chiefly of a chronic character. (Tables I and II.) In the first quarter of the year 497 persons died, in the second quarter 388, in the third quarter 384, and in the fourth quarter 462. (Table III.) The number of children born was 2688, of whom 1385 were boys, 1303 girls ; and of whom 46 were born in Dulwich, 711 in Camberwell, 823 in St. George's and 1108 in Peckham. (Table IV.) Such are the bare statistical facts on which I now proceed to comment. The Registrar General, in his summary of weekly returns for 1863, shews that the corrected death-rate of the Metropolitan population for that year was 2.452 per cent; he shows that this is slightly (.029) above the average of the preceding 24 years, still more (.89) above the average of the ten years 1850-59, and that from the year 1860, in which the rate of mortality was very low (2.249 per cent.) it has gradually increased, until it attained its present comparatively high figure. He proceeds to say, "London is divided into five groups of districts; and the mortality for the year in the West districts was at the rate of 2.324; in the districts South of the Thames 2.337; in the North districts 2.381. Thus over these great districts the mortality was nearly uniform, the rate having slightly exceeded 2.3 in 100. The East districts lost annually 2.655, and the central districts 2.664 in 100 inhabitants. The mortality of the South group of districts was below its high average of the previous years." "The excess of mortality in the year," I still quote the Registrar General, "is principally due to the zymotic class of diseases, which killed 13,001 persons in the 52 weeks of 1860, 19 and 21,005 in the 53 weeks of 1863. 2012 persons died of small-pox in London, notwithstanding all the facilities for vaccination ; 345 persons died of the same disease in the previous year, when measles was fatal to 2281 lives, while in the year 1863 its victims were 1698. "Fever prevailed in the years 1862-63, and no less than 3635 and 2892 deaths were ascribed to typhus, under which typhoid fever and relapsing fever are still included, as their diagnosis is not attempted by all practitioners. "The late Dr. George Gregory, in his classical lectures on the eruptive fevers, described the ravages of scarlatina with the hand of a master. 'The years 1838, 1839, 1810, were,' he says, 'years of epidemic prevalence. It is probable that no epidemic of similar length and intensity ever before visited this country. In the whole year (1839) the deaths were 2500.' "Since that date the epidemics of scarlatina in London have frequently swelled the mortality; and in 1858-59, the deaths were 4118 and 4197; but in 1863, the deaths amounted to 5075 Since the time that Dr. Gregory wrote, diphtheria has sprung into existence, and the deaths of the year from that disease were 724." From the above extracts it will be seen that, during the year 1863, certain diseases have prevailed in London with unusual severity, of which small-pox, typhus, and scarlet fever are the most important; and that the death-rate of London has been unusually high; but that of the five groups of districts into which London is divided, the death-rate in the Western group was the lowest and that in the Southern group the next lowest, the difference between the two death-rates being quite trivial. The Registrar General's analysis does not extend to the illdividual districts of London, much less to the sub-districts. It devolves upon me therefore to determine the death-rates of Camberwell and of its component parts for the year 1863, and 20 to show in what degrees the epidemic diseases, which have prevailed in London, have prevailed in them. As a preliminary step to this inquiry, it is necessary for U3 to have a clear understanding of the principles on which the determination of the death-rate depends. A death-rate is in principle the ratio between the number of individuals forming a population, and the total number of deaths which have occurred in that population during some given period of time, ordinarily for convenience fixed at twelve months. Thus if, out of a population of 10,000 persons, 200 die in the course of a year, two deaths occur to each hundred of that population, and the death-rate is 2.0 per cent. But practically while the number of deaths occuring in any locality during a year is a definite number which can with little difficulty be accurately ascertained, the other element in the calculation is a varying number which can only be approximatively estimated. Populations of towns, of districts, of parishes are constantly shifting and undergoing other changes. Hence, for the purposes of the death-rate, not the total number of different persons who have resided in the place during the year, but the mean average number of yearly residents has to be taken. It is manifest that if there be a shifting population in a locality, but the actual number of persons present never undergoes any variation, the death-rate may be as easily and as simply ascertained as if the population had been perfectly stationary. But if the population changes not only in respect of individuals, but in respect of numbers also, it is manifest that unless these latter changes can be reduced to some law, neither the total nor the average population can be ascertained, and the determination of the death-rate becomes an impossibility. The population of England is counted once every ten years, and from the results of these numberings (which take place in April) the mean average population both of the census-years 21 and of all intermediate years has to be deduced. Successive censuses have shewn that, for the last fifty years or more, the population of England has steadily increased, and that the rate of increase has been such as to enable statisticians to calculate with some degree of success the successive annual additions to the population. The same may be stated with respect to the metropolis. And the same, though from the smaller numbers involved and other associated sources of fallacy in a much less degree, holds good generally with respect to smaller populations, such as those of parishes, of districts, and of sub-districts. The last census having shewn that there was in London on the 8th April, 1861, a population of 2,803,989, and that during the previous ten years the increase had been at the annual rate of 1.73* per cent., the Registrar General, assuming that this is still the rate of increase, calculates that the population of London in the middle of 1863, was—not 2,803,989—but 2,803,989+100,424, or 2,904,413 ; and he estimates the deathrate not on the number of persons living at the time of the census, but on the population expressed by the latter and larger number. Again, the year 1863 contained 53 Saturdays instead of 52, and thus, since the local Registrars' returns are made up weekly, comprised the mortality of 371 days instead of 364. The actual length of a year is 365.2422 days And hence, in estimating the death-rate of the year, the Registrar General makes a further correction, he reduces the total number of deaths returned in the ratio of 371 to 365.2422. By these two procedures, of which one increases the number of the population, while the other diminishes the number of deaths, the death-rate becomes, and very properly, much reduced from that * The increase per cent. per decennium was 18.7, which is equal to an increase of 1.73 per cent. per annum for ten years. 22 which the employment of the uncorrected totals would have yielded. I have shewn in former reports that the population of the parish of Camberwell has (like that of the other peripheral parishes of London) increased much more rapidly than the population of the more central districts, much more rapidly than the population of the metropolis taken as a whole, much more rapidly even than the population of the Southern group of districts; that no comparison of Camberwell with the rest of London can be fair unless the relative rates of increase be taken into the account; and that the increase of Camberwell, and still more the increase of its sub-districts, are liable to fluctuations which defy all mathematical rules, and render any estimates of their population far less trustworthy than the estimates made for more extensive and populous areas. Now the population of Camberwell was, in April, 1861, 71,488, and it had increased during the previous ten years by the addition of 16,821 persons, or 30.77 per cent. The increase for London during the same period had been 18.7 per cent. What then was the mean average population of Camberwell during 1803? or (what is always taken to represent the same thing) what was its population in the middle of the year? If Camberwell had increased since April, 1801, at the same rate as London itself is assumed to have increased, its population at the end of June, 1863, would have amounted to 74,048. If it had increased at the same rate as the Southern group of districts increased between 1851 and 1861 (viz. at 2.28 percent. per annum), its population would have amounted to about 75,155 If it had increased at the same geometrical rate at which it increased during the last decenniad, its population would have amounted to not much less than 76,437.* * I have not performed the calculation leading to this result quite 23 During the year of 53 weeks, 1731 deaths were recorded; if this number be reduced in the ratio of 371 to 865.25* (as for purposes of comparison has been shewn to be essential) the year's mortality becomes 1704. And the death-rate per cent. becomes, on the supposition that the population was 74,018, 2.30, on the supposition that the population was 75,155, 2.26, and on the supposition that the population was 76,437, 2.23. Now it will be observed, that every one of these death-rates is below the estimated death rate for the year of London cr of any (even the most favoured) of its groups of districts. The first death-rate however is undoubtedly too high, inasmuch as it is founded on an unquestionable under-estimate of the population. But is either of the other death-rates accurate? Judging from former statistical experience, there is some reason to believe that the estimate of 75,155 is below, the estimate of 76,437 above, the actual strength of the population, and therefore that the death-rate lies somewhere between 2.26 and 2.23. But it is, I believe, well known that although the parish of Camberwell did actually increase very largely during the last decenniad, its progress was by no means uniform; that during the earlier portion of this period comparatively little advance was made; that during its last two or three years the advance became rapid; and that, since 1861, this rapidity of progress has continued unchecked. This fact, if it be a fact, has no place in the census-tables, and implies an increase in the number of the ing to the Registrar General's plan of calculation; since to have done so would have involved a long arithmetical process, and would have yielded no adequate results. I have estimated the increase for ten years at the same rate of increase that took place between 1851 and 1861, and have added, to the population existing in April 1861, 2¼ parts of this estimated increase. * For the purposes of my own calculation I have assumed the length of a year to be 365.25 days, instead of 365.2422, a difference facilitating computation, and not tending to mislead. 24 lation greater than the results of these tables would have led us to anticipate. Its truth is confirmed by the increase of the number of houses in the parish since the beginning of 1861,* and by the increase in the number of births, (Table V.) The mean birth-rate of England, during the present century, has been ascertained by the Registrar General to be 3.318 per cent., or one birth to 30 persons living. There is no reason to suppose that the birth-rate of Camberwell differs materially from this. During the year 1863, 2688 births were registered in the parish. For the purposes of comparison, this number (on the same principles that have guided us with regard to the deaths in 1863,) must be reduced to 2646. Now if these births had occurred in normal proportion to the population, the population of the parish must have been, not 75,155 nor 76,437, but actually at the end of the year 79,477—in the middle of the year therefore about 78,244. The death-rate estimated for this latter number, amounts to 2.18. We will now compare the death-rates of the sub-districts of Camberwell with one another. The population of Dulwich, in 1861, was 1723, and its increase in the previous ten years had been 5.57 per cent. The population of Camberwell proper was * New Houses erected in Camberwell during the years 1861-62 and 63. 1861 1862 1863 Total.

The deaths registered in each of these sub-districts in 1863 were, in Dulwich 22, in Camberwell 560, in St. George's 450, and in Peckham 699. But the mortality assigned to Camberwell proper included 169 deaths in the lunatic asylums and workhouse, which belonged no more to this district than to other districts of the parish, and which, to render any comparison between the districts fair, should be omitted from computation or divided proportionately between them. If this apportionment be made, and if at the same time the deaths of the several districts be reduced for the reasons and on the plan previously explained, the mortality becomes for Dulwich 24, for Camberwell 426, for St. George's 491, and for Peckham 763. The rates of mortality will of course depend on the numbers of the respective populations. If we assume that the districts of Camberwell have increased at the same annual rate as the entire South of London increased between 1851 and 1861, their populations and death-rates for 1863 were as follows:— Dulwich. Camberwell. St. George's. Peckham. Population 1811 223,90 21,376 29,578 Death-rate 1.32 1.90 2.29 2.58 But, as I have already shewn, the increase in the population of Camberwell, and especially the increase in the population of Peckham, were beyond all doubt considerably greater than in the above calculation I have assumed them to be. And if the districts have increased at the same rate since 1861, as they increased prior to that date, their populations and their deathrates will be indicated in the following figures:— 26 Dulwich. Camberwell. St. George's. Peckham. Population 1742 22,260 21,027 30,904* Death-rate 1.38 1.91 2.27 2.46 But that irregularity of increase, which prevents us from accepting the conclusions as to the number of the Camberwell population derived from ordinary modes of calculation, is a greater disturbing influence when we come to deal with sections of Camberwell. Of all the districts, Peckham seems to have grown the most rapidly since 1801. I appeal again to the relative increase in the number of houses and to the relative numbers of births. The number of births due to each district for a year of 365.25 days was, in 1863, for Dulwich 45, for Camberwell 700, for St. George's 810, and for Peckham 1091. And hence the population of each district, assuming every 3.318 births to correspond to one hundred persons living, would have been (in the middle of the year) for Dulwich 1423, for Camberwell 21,133, for St. George's 23,070, for Peckham 32,018; and the death-rates in the same order would become 1,69, 2.06, 2.07 and 2.38. Let us now compare the death-rates of Camberwell and ita four sub-districts with their respective death-rates in former years. There is no doubt that the number of deaths registered in the year 1863 was very much in excess of the number registered in former years. Indeed, for some years past, there has been a gradual but decided increase in this respect. Further, there is no reason to suppose that Camberwell has not shared in those influences, whatever they may be, which have operated to render the mortality throughout the whole of England heavier * An unimportant discrepancy exists between the numbers given in this line and the population of the parish (calculated on the same principle) given on a preceding page. The discrepancy arises from neglect of decimals in the earlier stages of the calculation. 27 than it has been for several years past. And hence there are good a priori grounds to anticipate the discovery of the prevalence throughout the parish of a comparatively high deathrate, independent of the existence of special local causes of unheal thiness- In former reports I have, when comparing the different parts of Camberwell with one another, excluded from computation the deaths occurring in the Lunatic asylums and in the Workhouse. By adopting this plan still, the number of deaths (estimated for 365.25 days) occurring in the several districts becomes for Dulwich 22, for Camberwell 385, for St. George's 443, and for Peckham 688; and the death-rates per cent. become, if the population has increased at the rate of increase of the South of London, for Dulwich 1.21, for Camberwell 1.72, for St. George's 2.07, and for Peckham 2.33; if the population has increased according to its former rate of increase, for Dulwich 1.25, for Camberwell 1.73, for St. George's 2.05, and for Peckham 2.22; but if calculated on the estimate of the population derived from the number of births, for Dulwich 1.55, for Camberwell 1.82, for St. George's 1.87, and for Peckham 2.15. On comparing the above estimates with those given in former years, the differences will be found to be of no very significant importance. My deductions from the foregoing lengthy analysis are these:— the death-rate of Camberwell during 1863 was, like that of London and of England generally, somewhat in excess of what it bad been during several preceding years; the death-rate of Camberwell was below that of London and of any of its five groups of districts; the death-rates of the sub-districts varied among themselves (as they always have varied) the death-rate of Peckham being (as it always has been) the highest; none of the death-rates, not even that of Peckham, has been 28 ently high to justify (on that ground alone) any feeling of alarm with regard to the health of the population. My analysis tends to show also how irregularly small populations vary; how uncertain therefore, in the intervals between successive censuses, must be our estimate of their numbers; how questionable must be the accuracy of the death-rates which we deduce from them; and how little significance differences in the death-rate of .2 or .3 per cent. must for the most part have. But supposing a death-rate to have been ascertained with perfect accuracy; what does it teach? what do we learn from it ? The prime fact of course is that out of so many persons living, so many persons have died in a given time. Experience has shewn that in ordinary years death-rates vary within comparatively narrow limits; that in the presence of severe outbreaks of epidemic diseases death-rates become augmented, and often very seriously augmented; that in certain localities which are generally assumed to be of inferior healthiness (such as large towns) the death-rates are mostly higher than they are in certain other localities (such as country districts) which enjoy the reputation of comparative salubrity. And on these and other grounds it has been assumed that the death-rate is a measure of the health of a population, and that the fluctuations of the death-rate imply corresponding fluctuations of health. To a certain extent this is true; but it is true only of the margin which remains after necessary deaths, (if I may use the expression) have been eliminated (and these constitute the great bulk of a mortality); and after the effects of all influences tending to disturb the due proportion between the young, the middle-aged and the old, the healthy, the sick and the dying have been investigated and allowed for. On the effects of those deaths which I have termed necessary upon death-rates I need not now enlarge. I may simply mention that I suppose such deaths to include amongst others all deaths from old age, from inherited 29 vices of constitution, from consumption, cancer, and many other chronic forms of disease. On the effects of the second class of causes however I have something to say, especially as I believe that they have a very important influence, and that this influence has been very generally overlooked. The influence of hospitals, of asylums and of workhouses and of any institution receiving the aged and sick is well illustrated in the present report, by the excessive mortality which the presence of the workhouse and of two lunatic asylums gives to the sub-district of Camberwell. But it may happen in another way that, by a kind of process of natural selection, the young and able-bodied tend to accumulate in certain localities, while the infants and the aged, and it may be the sickly, remain in undue proportion in other localities. To illustrate this: the death-rate of Dulwich has always been remarkably low; the death-rate of Peckham, without being really remarkably high, has always been by contrast remarkably high, and it has been assumed that therefore Dulwich is far more healthy than Peckham. I believe Dulwich to be very healthy; I know that Peckham, in its low-lying parts, has many elements of unhealthiness; but I do not for one moment believe that the difference of their death-rates indicates a corresponding difference in their healthiness, still less of course that the excess of its death-rate is a measure of the degree in which diseases, preventible by the action of the Vestry, prevail in Peckham. I have said on former occasions, and I repeat it now, that there is in many parts of Peckham a large poor population ; that amongst such a population children get neglected and die of illnesses, from which under other conditions they would doubtless have recovered; that from their habits of life contagious diseases spread among them with far greater virulence than they do among the so-called better classes, and that illnesses are manufactured amongst them which those who live in different 30 circumstances rarely see. I have said formerly, and I say again, that (although important improvements have been made), there are many localities in Peckham which, in great measure from want of sewerage, are still in a condition to make them (in the presence of epidemics of cholera or of fever) hot-beds of these diseases. Fortunately we have escaped such disasters. Doubtless some of these conditions have influenced injuriously the death-rate of Peckham. But Dulwich comprises mainly the houses of the rich, Peckham mainly the houses of the poor. A typical Dulwich household consists of the father, mother and children, and of a considerable number of other persons— domestic servants—in the prime of life, and for the most part in the prime of health, draughted, so to speak, from the poorer households and therefore from the poorer localities Now the mortality in such a household is as a rule the mortality of the family, and not the mortality of the servants of the family. If the latter become ill and die, their deaths rarely if ever occur in the houses to which they are attached; their own homes or the hospital become their final refuge. So that in such a household there is, in varying but often large proportion, a population which can add nothing to the deaths of the household, and the presence of which, in a statistical sense, must necessarily therefore produce a fallacious appearance of healthiness; a condition the exact converse of that which obtains at a workhouse or a hospital. Obviously Dulwich, which comprises such households in large proportion, owes no inconsiderable proportion of its apparent healthiness to this cause. Peckham, on the other hand, comprises in large measure the houses of the poor. Their inmates consist of the parents and a family of children, but of no domestic servants. In fact, the elder and adult children are just the material of which domestic servants are made, and have probably quitted home for service elsewhere. So that in such a household, not only are the numbers not swelled by the influx 31 of a (so to speak) non-dying population, but on the contrary are diminished by the efflux of a certain number of those who, in a statistical sense, are the very vitality of the family. There remains therefore a population somewhat below the normal average in health and strength, which of itself would naturally yield a comparatively high death-rate, and in which the deathrate is liable to be still further increased, from the fact that many of those who have left the parent roof return thither to die when fatal illness overtakes them. I am not, of course, asserting that all the households of Peckham are of one class, or that all the households of Dulwich are of another class; I am not asserting that all the elder children of the poor go out to service, or that of those that die, all die at their own homes and none in the house of their master. But I assert, that the one class of household prevails in Peckham, the other class prevails in Dulwich; that the differences in regard to them which I have pointed out are real differences, which must necessarily affect the respective death-rates of Peckham and of Dulwich ; and that differences of death-rate due to these conditions are totally unconnected with local salubrity or insalubrity. Again, the poor (excepting those of them who go to service) as a rule marry eailier and are more prolific than those who are above them in station. Hence a poor population comprises a proportionately larger number of children than a wealthy population. But children up to four or five years of age, even under the most favorable circumstances, die in much larger proportion than the population at any higher age. Here then is another disturbing influence operating injuriously on the death-rate of a poor locality, and not improbably forming a very appreciable item in widening the interval between the death-rates of Peckham and of Dulwich. The fact is that the sanitary condition of a locality is much more truly measured by the comparative prevalence in it of 32 certain forms of disease than by mere variations of death-rate ; although no doubt a large, and especially an increasing, deathrate is a matter to arrest attention and to demand inquiry. Thus if, in a certain place, ague prevails, we know it to be unhealthy from the presence of marsh miasm; if cholera or typhoid fever prevails in a locality, we have good reason to believe that in that locality the atmosphere or the water is unduly impregnated with the poison of cesspools or of sewers; if typhus fever breaks out, there is ground to suspect that the population among whom it appears are overcrowded, their houses filthy and insufficiently ventilated. But it does not necessarily follow that the presence or the spread of such diseases proves local insalubrity; many of them are infectious, and if introduced into a crowded neighbourhood will spread in it however otherwise healthy that neighbourhood may be. The prevalence of any of them, however, in a markedly aggravated form, or for an unusually long period, renders the presence of local causes of insalubrity exceedingly probable. Now there are certain diseases, which the Registrar General terms zymotic; the class includes those diseases which more than any others are supposed to measure local salubrity or insalubrity. Let us take the most important of these, and see how, in regard to them, Camberwell, Peckham and London stand in comparison with one another. The appended Table has been devised with this object. In calculating this Table, it must be understood that I have taken the numbers of deaths as they are given by the Registrar General himself for 53 weeks that I have adopted the Regis- * Thus, he assigns 50 deaths in Camberwell to fever; I estimate the number of fever-deaths at 41 only. But as the same kind of error which leads him to increase the fever-deaths in Camberwell, doubtless leads him also to 33 trar General's estimate of the population of London, and in determining that of Camberwell and that of Peckham have assumed their annual increase to have been at the rate of '2.28 per cent., a rate which I have previously shown to be undoubtedly below their real rates of increase. Deaths in Cam berwell, per 10,000. Deaths in Peckham, per 10,000. Deaths in London, per 10000. Small Pox 1.7 1.3 6.7 Fever 6.6 6.4 9.7 Scarlet Fever 16.8 19.8 17.4 Diphtheria 3.5 3.7 2.3 Measles 4.2 5.7 5.7 Hooping Cough 7.5 8.7 7.3 It will be thus seen, that far from favouring Camberwell and Peckham, I have yielded in making my comparison points which would have been to their advantage. Yet it appears that as regards small-pox, fever, scarlet fever and measles, Camberwell has the advantage of London; thai as regards hooping cough there is scarcely any difference between them; and that diphtheria is the only one of these diseases in which the average of Camberwell exceeds that of London. It appears further, that as regards small-pox and fever, Peckham is not only below the metropolis but below the parish as a whole; that as regards measles, Peckham is equal to London but above Camberwell; that as regards diphtheria it exceeds London, but is about equal to Camberwell; and that as regards scarlet fever and hooping cough, it manifests a decided but not very large excess over magnify in similar proportion fever-deaths in other parts of London, I have considered it more just, for the purposes of comparison, to retain the higher number. 34 both. We can scarcely appeal to these figures and say that they tend to prove that the parish of Camberwell, or even the district of Peckham, is relatively to the rest of London unhealthy; we can scarcely even deduce from them that Peckham appears lees healthy than the rest of the parish. Indeed, considering that circumstances have prevailed, over which at most we have a very limited control, to occasion throughout the metropolis an epidemic prevalence in an unusually severe form of small-pox, of true typhus, and of scarlet fever, I cannot but feel that as regards the first two diseases, at least, we have suffered comparatively lightly, and have reason to be thankful. The works which have been executed during the year have been for the most part of the usual character, as a reference to the table (Table VI.) will shew. 1393 houses were inspected, and as a result of these inspections 134 houses have been cleansed and whitewashed and 41 have been repaired; 52 yards have been paved or otherwise amended; 8 dust-bins have been provided; in 56 cases water has been laid on to the premises for drinking purposes, and in 24 it has been supplied to closets; 281 cesspools have been emptied, and 68 abolished; 137 closets have been provided and 229 drains cleansed or amended. Besides these, 933 nuisances arising from accumulations of ashes, dung or other refuse, from pigs, obnoxious trades, &c., have been inquired into, and in most instances remedied or removed. In addition to the above, 55 slaughter-houses have been under supervision and 64 cow-houses, all of which have during the year been reported on at length and have received their licenses unopposed. Further, late in the year, all the bake-houses in the parish were carefully inspected, and the result of this inspection is embodied in the following extract of my report to the Vestry, dated December 16, 1863. "The inspection of bake-houses, which has been completed 35 daring the last few weeks, shews that there are 80 of these places in the parish; that in 17 only is the bake-house in the basement; that in 63 it is behind the house or on the ground floor of the house; and that in 17 of this latter number it is entirely detached. As regards cleanliness the results were not altogether satisfactory; 28 were more or less dirty, some very much so; and a few were more or less out of repair. In respect of ventilation, the air in the bake-houses was in most cases found hot and oppressive; but all had means of ventilation, some abundant, and none so defective as to call for actual interference. In one or two cases defective privies or water-closets adjoined the bakehouse. There were none in which, so far as we could ascertain, the bake-house itself was made a sleeping apartment, although there was one that some little time prior to my own visit certainly had contained a bed. There was none even in which the sleeping apartment was on the same floor; but there were 9 in which a bed-room was placed above the bakehouse. We did not learn that any lad under 18 was employed in any one of the bake-houses between the hours of 9 p.m. aud 5 a.m.; and, indeed, a large number of the bakers do not seem to begin work before four or five in the morning. On the whole, with the exception of want of cleanliness, the condition of bake-houses throughout the parish seems to be satisfactory. There is no doubt that those occupying the basement are for the most part objectionably placed, and have the least efficient means of ventilation. It should be added that many of the bake-houses were very good." I may here mention that during the year small-pox became unusually prevalent, and that much pains was taken to arrest the disease. The Board of Guardians gave great assistance and encouragement in the matter; and by their appointed vaccinators all the charity and national schools and several other schools were inspected, and the children in them, who were in 36 need of vaccination (amounting to a large total) were vaccinated. Following on these measures the epidemic subsided. Further, I have continued to report monthly on the quality and illuminating power of the gas furnished by the South Metropolitan Gas Company; and on the quality of the water supplied by the Kent, the Lambeth, and the Southwark and Vauxhall Companies respectively. The reports have, with one exception, been uniformly favorable—the exception being the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, which for a short time circulated imperfectly-filtered water. Finally, I have to bear testimony to the zeal and efficiency of your Inspectors of Nuisances; and on my own part, to thank you for the unfailing consideration and kindness which you continue to shew me, both in my official and in my private capacity.
