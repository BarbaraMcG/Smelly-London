Clerkenwell Detached.—With regard to this outlying portion ot the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history: — "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from 20 London, and on the north-western confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a 'great cure performed upon a King of Scots, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell, a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell.' Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River. "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initial affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 72 houses and pieces of land in assessment. The Annual Elections of Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts took place on the 29th 21 and 30th May, 1893.—In Ward No. 1 (Pentonville), the election was held at Claremont Hall, Penton Street, and was decided without a poll; Messrs Evan Jones and Mills Goody being re-elected for a term of three years; and Mr. J. H. Hurrell and Mr. M. Doerr being elected for three years in place of Mr. D. W. Jones and Mr. F. Newport, who did not seek re-election. Mr. J. B. Lewis was elected Auditor of Accounts.

Wakerley was elected for two years in place of Mr. Catley, resigned. Mr. S. Saioman was elected Auditor of Accounts. In Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's), the election was held at the Vestry Hall, and was also decided without a poll. Mr. D. Cooksey, Mr. W. Blagdon Richards, B.A.. and Mr. R. Squire were re-elected, and Mr. F. G. Scheib filled a vacancy caused by the retirement of Mr. Arthur White. Mr. E. Lenard was re-elected Auditor of Accounts. In Ward No. 4 (St. James'), the election was held at No. 20 St. John Street Road, this election also being decided without a poll. The retiring members, Mr. E. J. Pearson, Mr. J. Pratt, Mr. W. Lumley and Mr. W. Davies, were re-elected, and Mr. R. Moffat and Mr. J. D. Griffiths were elected 22 in place of Mr. E. Daker and Mr. G. J. Sutton. Mr. W. Pearson was re-elected as Auditor of Accounts. In Ward No. 5 (St. John's), the election was held at the Constitutional Hall, 15, Clerkenwell Green, and was also decided without a poll. Mr. A. T. Boon was re-elected, and Mr. W. J. Hunter, Mr. W. Pierpoint, Mr. A. W. Cooper and Mr. W. H. Drury were elected for three years in the places of Mr. E. Chiswell, Mr. J. J. Potts, Mr. R. Owen and Mr. W. O'Connor. Mr. M. M. Grunfeld was elected for two years in place of the Rev. Wm. Dawson, resigned. Mr. A. A. Bellefontaine was reelected Auditor of Accounts. Personal.—During the year the Vestry have received with regret the resignations of Mr. C. H. Norbury, Mr. Martin Doerr, Mr. Evan Jones, M.R.C.S., and Mr. W. T. Richardson. Meetings.—Under the Bye-laws of the Vestry Standing Committees are appointed at the first Meeting of the Vestry after the Annual Elections, and Special Committees are appointed from time to time to deal with special questions, and it is at the Meetings of these Committees that a very large quantity of the detail work of the Vestry is carried out. The following statement shows the number of Meetings held by the Vestry and the various Committees during the year, and will also show the parishioners that the administration of their local affairs is no light task, but is one which entails considerable labour on those who, recognising the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, come forward to take part in the municipal work of the Parish:— 28 Vestry 48 Works Committee 51 Wharf Committee 7 Joint Works and Sanitary Committee 1 Works Sub-Committee 1 Public Health Committee24 Valuation Committee 13 Finance Committee 15 Law and Parliamentary Committee 5 Special Committees 4 Vestry Hall Committee 8 Vestry Hall Sub-Committee 1 Petty Sessions 6 Rates.—During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the Half-year to Michaelmas, 1893. A Poor Rate of 1s. l0d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £31,680 A Sewer Rate of 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1 440 A Lighting Rate Id. ,, ,, ,, 1,440 A General Rate 13. 0d. ,, ,, ,, 17,280 3s. 0d. £51,840 For the Half-year to Lady-day, 1894. A Poor Rate of 1s. 8d. including a Library Rate of 1d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £29,800 A Lighting Rate 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,490 A General Rate 1s. 1d. ,, ,, ,, 19,370 2s. l0d. £50,660 The Rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £369,311, and those made in October, for the halfyear to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £374,945. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £31,792 in the first, and £28,082 in the second half-year, total £59.874. 24 The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £4,061 17s. 9d. and £3,798 16s, 9d. in the first and second halfyears respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union, include the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor Rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £19,879 10s. lOd., divided into moieties of £9,939 15s. 5d. in the first, and £9,939 15s. 5d. in the second half-year. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, it receives from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with two fifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants formerly paid from the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payments of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day, for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the latter amount for the year ending Lady-day, 1894, is £7,886, the amount 25 being based, for the first five local financial years, on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The precept of the School Board for the year 1893 amounted to the sum of £15,539 3s. l0d. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,645 19s. 6d. It will thus be seen that of the £102,500 raised during the year, the sum of £75,199 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 5s. l0d. in the pound for the year, 4s. 3½d. was for other bodies, and 1s. 6½d. for the local administration, paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1,418 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 42 committal warrants per quarter were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied, and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large maiority 26 of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 18 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Valuation Lists.—One Supplemental and four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year, dealing with 377 Assessments and raising the rateable value by £6,213. School Board Precepts.—The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870 : £ s. d £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1888 - 9,897 16 2 1872 948 11 2 1884 11,054 2 2 1873 780 0 2 1885 11,999 1 10 1874 1,869 9 3 1886 12,890 9 0 1875 3,267 12 11 1887 12,210 12 5 1876 4,897 4 9 1888 11,717 15 1 1877 6,046 10 1 1889 13,252 6 0 1878 6,013 14 10 1890 16,052 19 4 1879 6,371 8 11 1891 16,589 15 11 1880 7,136 9 8 1892 15,869 10 11 1881 7,900 4 4 1893 15,539 8 10 1882 8,067 10 5 London County Council Precepts.—The following are the amounts raised from the Parish of Clerkenwell by the County Council:— For the year ending 81st March, 1800 (12.55d.) £18,696 l1s. 1d.

"This amount is for the last quarter of the Board's existence to 31st March 1889, and £6 18s. 7d, was added for Government Property. 28 Collection of the Rates.—Of the rates made in the Parish of Clerkenwell, a percentage of about 93½ is actually collected, 6½ per cent being irrecoverable from allowances to owners who compound, empty houses, runs, and excusals on the ground of poverty. It follows therefore that when the Parish is called upon to satisfy the precept of some Central body, such as the County Council or the School Board, which is stated to be at the rate of say 1s. in the pound, an actual rate of nearly 13d. must be made to produce the amount required. Parliamentary Representation by the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885.—The Parish of Clerkenwell forms the Central Division of the Parliameniary Borough of Finsbury, and was represented in the Parliament of 1886, which was dissolved in 1892, by Captain Frederick Thomas Penton. At the ensuing General Election in July, 1892, the result of the poll wab as follows:— Hon. Dadabhai Naoroji (L.) 2,959 Captain F. T. Penton (C.) 2,956 Majority 3 A re-count of the votes took place on the 8th August, resulting in the totals being altered to Hon. Dadabhai Naoroji 2,961 Captain F. T. Penton 2,956 Majority 5 Subsequently a scrutiny took place before Mr. Justice Cave and Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams, and after an enquiry extending over three days, the petition was withdrawn. The Parish also forms part of the Hornsey Division of the County of Middlesex, represented 29 in the last and the present Parliaments by H. C. Stephens, Esq.

At the triennial election which took place on the 5th March, 1892, the following gentlemen were returned as the representatives of the Division of Central Finsbury:— Hon. Ashley Ponsonby, 9, Princes Gate, S.W. Mr. Ernest Bowen Bowlands.

Phoenix Wharf, Commercial Boad, Lambeth.— Taken by the Vestry on lease in 1881 (expiring at Lady Day, 1909), as a Depot for the disposal of refuse at a rental of £615, a sum of £500 being paid as a premium, and £1,903 16s. being spent in the construction of stables, paving, &c. 27, Commercial Boad.—Held on lease at £45 per annum for 21 years from Michaelmas, 1883, and used as a residence by the Wharf Superintendent. Spencer Place.—Van shed erected by the Yestry, and held on lease of the Marquess Northampton for 18} years from Christmas, 1891, at a rental of £5 per annum. The net cost of erection and enclosure was £'236 9s. 7d. 247-253, Pentonville Boad, formerly the site of a Toll-House. Now leased to Mr. George Ell in two leases at £50 per annum each, expiring at Michaelmas, 1962. 245, Pentonville Boad, a freehold house 35 adjoining the above, also leased to Mr. Ell for the same term, at £22 per annum. Wilmington and Northampton Squares and St. James Churchyard are vested in the Vestry as open spaces, and the —estry also contributes to the maintenance of St. John's burial ground in Benjamin Street as an open space. New Yestry Hall.—The Yestry have taken steps for the erection of the new Yestry Hall on the land acquired in Rosebery Avenue. Certain Architects were invited to send in designs for a building to cost £12,000; premiums of 50, 30, and 20 guineas respectively being offered for the three best, the premium of the successful competitor merging in a commission of 5 per cent. on the actual cost The President of the Institute of British Architects was requested to appoint an Assessor to advise upon the plans, and he nominated Mr. Aston Webb, E.R.I.B.A. The conditions of competition having been settled, the invitations were issued, the designs to be submitted by the 27th October. Eleven designs were duly submitted, which were examined by the Assessing Architect, who reported that the points which he had to consider were light and air, the arrangement of the offices, &c., the architecture, the cost, and the compliance with the County Council regulations for approaches, staircases, &c., and that, in his opinion, the designs numbered 6, II, and 9, should be the three to receive the premiums to be awarded in the order in which they are stated. His advice was followed, with the result that the successful Architect was Mr. Charles Evans-Vaughan, of 25, Lowther Arcade ; Mr. A. Saxon Snell, and Mr. Edmund J. Harrison being second and third. Mr. H. H. Tasker, of 53, Penton Street, was appointed Quantity Surveyor. 36 On the 22nd February the drawings, specifications, &c., being prepared, the Vestry decided to invite tenders from ten firms of repute, and on the 8th March the tenders were received and opened, the lowest, that of Messrs C. Dearing & Son, of Halliford Street, Islington, being accepted; the sum being £14,724 13s. Od. The work was duly commenced on the 19th March, in accordance with the contract. Summary Proceedings.—During the year summonses have been issued at the instance of the Vestry, and heard by the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court in respect of the following offences:— No. of Summonses issued. Offences charged. Convict ions. Dismissals. Penalties and Costs. £ s. d. 2 Neglecting to cleanse w c. 2 1 0 0 4 „ repair defective w.c. 4 4 6 0 5 Defective drains 5 23 16 0 1 Neglecting to unstop drain 1 5 6 0 2 Constructing drain so as to be a nuisance 2 6 7 6 2 Neglecting to provide traps 2 7 10 0 1 ,, provide sufficient w.c. accommodation 1 2 2 0 2 Fixing soil pipes not in accordance with by laws 2 1 12 0 3 Neglecting to make houses habitable . 3 3 2 0 5 Illegally letting underground rooms 3 1 wthdn. 1 dismsd- 3 6 0 2 Neglecting to notify infectious diseases 2 0 18 0 3 Exposing infectious persons 3 8 6 0 2 Smoke nuisance 2 4 2 0 30 Adulterated articles 29 1 33 15 6 *6 Articles unfit for food 5 1 46 11 0 70 66 4 152 0 0 *One of these cases was heard at the Mansion Honse, and dismissed on the ground that the Vendor did not know that the articles were bad when he sold them. Of the penalties and costs (£46 11s.) only £11 11s. was recovered. In one case the defendant was fined £35 or one month's imprisonment, and ha went to prison. 37 Removal of offensive matter. — The Vestry applied to the Queen's Bench Division for a rule for a mandamus to the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court to hear and determine a summons by them against Messrs. Cook & Co., soap manufacturers, for an offence against one of the bye-law? of the London County Council prohibiting the carrying of foul matter through the streets of the Metropolis except within certain hours. On the hearing of the summons on November 2nd, it was represented to the learned magistrate that the byelaw had been enacted without any consultation with the trade, and that, as they objected to this one on the ground that it was practically inconvenient, Messrs. Cook & Co. were about to petition the Council for some extension of the hours or some modification of the bye-law. Upon this the magistrate adjourned the summons sine die, with leave to the parties to apply for the further hearing in order to afford him the opportunity of seeing what the Council might do, in order to guide him in the course he should take. The Yestry objected to the adjournment as, in the meantime, the foul matter was being carried through the streets at all hours, and the bye-law was thus defeated; and hence the application, in answer to which the magistrate made an affidavit stating the reasons for the course he had taken. The case was heard on the 27th January. Mr. Bodkin appeared to show cause against the application, contending that the course taken was warranted by section 16 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, and was very convenient. [Mr. Justice Day said he thought it was very reasonable and convenient to obviate the necessity for repeated applications for a hearing]. Mr. Spokes, on the part of the Yestry, urged in 38 support of the application that in the meantime the bye-law was defeated, and it might be many months before the County Council had modified the bye-law. The Court, however thought that the adjournment was convenient and reasonable, and dismissed the application with costs. Messrs. Cook & Co. subsequently applied to the Council for an alteration of the bye-law, but were unsuccessful; the Magistrate then convicted the defendants and imposed a penalty of 10s. Streets partly situate in other Parishes.—The particulars below mentioned show the Orders which have been made from time to time under sec. 140 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the agreements which are in force with other Local Authorities with regard to streets partly in this parish and partly in the adjoining parishes. An Agreement, dated November, 1861, between the Vestries of Clerkenwell and St. Fancras, by which the entire width of Bagnigge Wells Road, now King's Cross Road, from the west side of Vernon Street to Baker Street is to be watered, cleansed and kept in repair by Clerkenwell; and the entire width from Vernon Street to Pentonville Road, and of Pentonville Road from the junction with King's Cross Road to the boundary between the Parishes of St. Pancras and Islington is to be watered, cleansed and kept in repair by St. Pancras. An Agreement, dated August, 1864, by which Clerkenwell maintains and repairs the whole of Goswell Road, in the Parish of Islington, and that portion of the City Road lying between the Obelisk and the Angel Hotel to the line formed by the then granite paving, and also the roadway in Sermon Lane; Islington maintaining and repairing Liverpool Road from Sermon Lane to High Street, and High Street between Upper Street and the granite paving line above referred to. An Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works of 6th February, 1885, placing the carriageway of Goswell Road, to the north of Seward Street, entirely under the management of Clerkenwell, and to the south of Seward Street entirely under the management of St. Luke. 39 An order of the London County Council, dated 21st December, j892, placing the portion of Clerkenwell Road, in the Parish of the Charterhouse, under the exclusive management of the Vestry of Clerkenwell. Shelter, 47 Northampton Road—The St. Luke's Vestry have discontinued their joint tenancy of the shelter provided by this Vestry for persons requiring accommodation while their homes are being disinfected. Sale of Food and Drugs Act.—The Vestry have during the year made arrangements for the analysis of private purchasers' samples of food and drugs, and have decided that any resident of the parish (traders excepted) shall be allowed, upon payment of 2s. 0d., to bring to the Vestry any article of food or drugs (purchased or delivered in the parish) for the purpose of being tested by the public Analyst. Should the sample submitted prove to be adulterated, the report will be handed over to the Inspector of the district, with the name and address of the seller, for the purpose of his taking samples in conformity with the Act, and if in that case the sample is found to be adulterated, the 2s. 6d. deposited by the person bringing the sample will be returned to him. The rule has been printed on the back of the ratepapers, but up to the present time practically no advantage has been taken of the arrangement by the parishioners. The Vestry in March, 1894, received a letter from the Local Government Board on the subject of the analyses made by the chemical officers of Somerset House under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, urgiug that samples of sufficient quantity should be purchased and that the utmost promptitude should be used in the transmission of samples to the 40 Analyst and in all subsequent stages; and also forwarding report of the Chief Chemical Officer, showing the results of certain investigations made by him with regard to the composition of milk. The suggestions of the Local Government Board were already generally adopted in this parish, but the special attention of the Sanitary Inspectors was called to the communication. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890— Bishop's Court, Aylesbury Place and Jerusalem Court—In reply to the letter of the Vestry to the County Council, referred to in the last report, suggesting that the neighbourhood of Bishop's Court would be a suitable one for the Council to deal with under Part 1 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, a letter has been received from the Council stating that they are unable to agree with the Vestry in the matter, and expressing the opinion that Bishop's Court, as well as Aylesbury Place and Jerusalem Court, should be more properly dealt with by schemes under Part 2 of the Act, and asking whether the Vestry were prepared to frame schemes for the improvement of those areas accordingly. The Medical Officer of Health reported upon the matter, as follows:— 7o the Public Health Committee, September \st, 1893, Gentlemen, In response to your request to report upon the Courts— Jerusalem Court, Bishop's Court, and Aylesbury Place, 1 beg to state that on May 23rd, 1889, 1 reported on the condition of the two first named, and having examined them recently, I find no sufficient reason for altering my opinion in regard to them. It should, however, be noticed that since my previous condemnation of Bishop's Court, the top (third) storeys have been done away with by the lowering of the roofs, so that the number of the inhabitants has been reduced, and the Court rendered more accessible to light and air. 41 In regard to Aylesbury Place, although the entrance is very objectionable, being through a narrow passage under a house, still the Court itself is fairly open and the houses have back yards, with separate water closets; so I do not propose to condemn them at present. I have, &c., J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Having carefully considered the subject, the Yestry informed the Council that they were not prepared to frame schemes for the improvement of the areas suggested under Part 2 of the Act. Bakehouses.—The Bakehouses in the Parish are inspected twice yearly by the Medical Officer of Health. After the inspection in July, 1893, the acting Medical Officer, Dr. Hockridge, reported as follows:— With regard to the Bakehouses of the Parish, I found them on the whole very clean; most of them commendably so; but in nearly all the ventilation was very defective, and I am of the opinion that with the present structural arrangements of the premises, very little improvement may be looked for in this direction, or at any rate until the politician comes to the aid of the sanitarian. The matter was referred to the Public Health Committee, who reported that in the existing state of the law the Yestry were not in a position to enforce any remedy. Sadler's Wells Theatre.—Notice was again received from Messrs. Wilmot and Freeman of their intention to apply for a music and dancing license for Sadler's Wells Theatre. The Yestry informed them that they would oppose the application, and communicated with the County Council accordingly. The application was again refused. 42 Post Office Sites Act: £10,000.—The longstanding question of the disposal by the County Council of the sum of £10,000 received by them under the provisions of the Post Office Sites Act, to be expended in an open space, has been at length settled by the Council purchasing two plots of vacant land on the eastern side of Rosebery Avenue, lying between Lloyd's Row and Rydon Crescent. The Vestry understand that arrangements are being made for laying out the ground as a continuation of Spa Green. Owen's Row.—This street has been paved with asphalte during the year, and advantage has been taken of the alteration to remove posts at the eastern end which prevented vehicular traffic passing through. Objection was taken by the Grirls' School authorities that the noise of passing traffic would be a serious hindrance to their school work, and the Vestry therefore fixed a moveable bar, which could take the place of the posts if the fears of noise were realised. Up to the present time, however, no complaints have been made to the Vestry. Passage by 101, White Lion Street.—In June a letter was received from Mr. T. H. Watson, of 9, Nottingham Place, W, stating that the covered passage, adjoining Mr. Culver's new premises, White Lion Street, had been formed in accordance with the agreed plan, and suggesting, on behalf of Mr. Culver, that, as he and Mr. Frye alone use the passage, and there is an iron gate across the north end of same, it would be desirable (to prevent the passage becoming a nuisance) that arrangements should be made, with the consent of the Vestry, to put up an iron gate at the south end with a lock of 43 which both Mr. Frye and Mr. Culver would hold a key; and asking whether such an arrangement would meet with the approval of the Vestry, and whether they would desire also to be furnished with a key. There is no doubt that the court in question was a source of considerable nuisance, and the Yestry gave consent for the erection of such gate, subject to Mr. Culver putting up a tablet that the court is public way, and to the Yestry being furnished with a key of the gate. The key was subsequently forwarded. Crawford Passage.—The suggestion has again been made to the Yestry that the narrow passage leading to Crawford Passage at the southern end of the old Workhouse site, Farringdon Road, should be widened by taking a piece of the site for the purpose, but they have not seen their way to adopt it. Goswell Terrace.—In September a letter was received from Mr. Glover, of 20, Northampton Square, stating that Mr. Boodle, on behalf of Lord Northampton, had directed him to pull down and clear away the houses at the end of Goswell Terrace, and necessary buildings in Upper Smith Street, and to make an opening through into Upper Smith Street, so as to ventilate the houses in the terrace, and to fix iron guard posts at each end and to leave an open space between, which may be used as a playground for the children; and asking, on behalf of Mr. Boodle, if the Yestry would help in the proposed improvement by taking over the open space or playground in the same way that they had done in Brunswick Close. The Yestry agreed to the request, and the proposal has since been carried out. 44 Gray's Inn Enclosure.—The Yestry, in September, invited the co-operation of the Hclborn District Board of Works in asking the Treasurer and Benchers of Gray's Inn to remove the present high wall enclosing their gardens in Theobald's Road, and to substitute for same a dwarf wall with iron railings, and so provide a pleasant aspect, as has been done by the New Biver Company with regard to the enclosed space in Bosebery Avenue. The District Board agreed, and a joint letter was addressed to the Benchers accordingly. They replied, stating that they were not unwilling to entertain the proposal, provided the Holborn District Board would pave with wood the roadway from Raymond Buildings to Holborn Town Hall, and from Hoiborn Town Hall to Holborn. The Holborn District Board also wrote enquiring how far the Yestry would be prepared to meet them with reference to the expense. The Yestry thanked the Benchers for the favourable consideration they had given to the scheme, but replied to the Holborn District Board that they had 110 power to expend money outside the limits of the parish. Rosoman Street — Proposed Improvement. — As notified in the last report, the Artizans', Labourers', and General Dwellings Company opened negotiations with the Yestry with the view to widening Rosoman Street, opposite Northampton Road, by setting back the projecting houses, Nos. 40, 48, and 50, and they asked the following as the terms in consideration of which they would be willing to pull down the projecting buildings, and set back the new buildings to a frontage line, as shown on the accompanying plans:— 1.—The substitution for the existing entrance in Skinner Street, to the passage called Plumbers Place, of a new archway 45 entrance in Rosoman Street, as shown on plan, with power to close Plumbers Place with gates at night to secure the proper supervision of the staircases of their buildings, but with free access from all points in day time. 2.—Power to put buildings over the sewer in Plumbers Place, at the corner of Skinner Street and Rosoman Street, as shown on the plan, complete access to the sewer in front, behind, and below, the new building being secured to the Vestry. 3.—Payment by the Vestry of £1000 towards costs incurred by the Artizans' Company. 4.—The Vestry to obtain all necessary approvals of public authorities, if any. After consideration, the Vestry replied that they were not prepared to entertain the proposal in its present form. The Company replied that unless the Vestry were prepared to make some counter offer which would be acceptable to the Company the proposal would have to be abandoned ; but the Yestry were not prepared to make any such proposal. The Company then substituted a payment by the Vestry of £50 per annum for ten years for their previous third condition. The matter was referred to the Works Committee, who informed the Company that, if the condition of a payment were withdrawn, they would recommend the Vestry to do the necessary paving at an estimated cost of ,£150. The Company submitted their offer amended accordingly. The matter was considered very fully by the Vestry, who eventually negatived the proposal of the Committee; the principal objection of the Vestry being to the stoppage of the current of air which would be caused by the present entrance to Plumber's Place being built over. The question was subsequently raised in a slightly different form, but with the same result; the Yestry passing a resolution that no scheme for dealing with the projecting houses in Rosoman Street will be satisfactory to the Vestry which involves the building over of any part of Plumber's Place. 46 Plumber's Place.—This thoroughfare now passing through the courtyard of Northampton Buildings, the Vestry have thought it desirable to mark the public way, and continuous lines of iron rail have therefore been fixed in the paving. Two tablets have also been fixed recording that these lines mark the boundaries of the public way. Records of the Parish.—An old minute book, dating from 1569, containing interesting records of the parish, has been repaired, and lent to the Public Library Commissioners for exhibition in the Library. Rodney Street.—A wall which formerly stood across the roadway of Rodney Street, separating it from Muriel Street, Islington, has been pulled down with the consent of the freeholder, the consequent making up of the roadways been done by the respective Vestries, and a desirable public improvement has been thereby effected. Goswell Road Widening.—The Vestry again approached the County Council with the view to their taking steps to widen the narrow portion of Goswell Road, and a deputation waited upon the Improvements Committee on the 8th February; but the Committee did not hold out much hope of the Council taking action in the matter unless the Vestry were prepared to contribute towards the cost; but the Vestry adhered to their opinion that the improvement is one of a metropolitan character which should be entirely borne by the County fund. St. John Street Widening.—The preceding paragraph applies equally to the suggested widening of St. John Street, between Aylesbury Street and Clerkenwell Road. 47 Site for County Council Offices. —In June, 1893, the Establishment Committee of the London County Council recommended the Council to acquire a site in Parliament Street for a County Hall aud Offices for the sum of £750,000. The Vestry unanimously decided that a strong protest be made to the Council against so enormous an expenditure, and that the Central Finsbury representatives on the Council be requested to oppose same. The Council, when it considered the report, passed the following resolution thereon:—That the Council in view of its resolution of June 27th, instructing Committees not to bring up during the present financial year (except in matters of urgency) recommendations involving large expenditure, is not at the present time prepared to entertain this proposal for the purchase of a new site for municipal buildings. London Improvements Bill.—Reference to the last Annual Report will show that the County Council in this Bill proposed to take certain sites in Rosebery Avenue for artizans' dwellings in connection with the Strand Improvement, and the plan deposited by the Council showed land in Calthorpe Street and in Rosebery Avenue, between Lloyd's Row and Rydon Crescent, upon which they proposed to erect artizans' dwellings for persons displaced by the proposed Strand Improvement. The Council, however, resolved to withdraw the provisions relating to the new street from Holborn to the Strand, and the clauses relating to the acquisition of sites for re-housing displaced persons from the Bill. Liquor Traffic (Local Control) Bill.—In April, 1893, a letter was received from the Holborn District Board of Works, expressing the opinion that the 48 Liquor Traffic (Local Control) Bill will, if passed into law, enormously decrease the value of licensed houses, and so throw a greater burden of rates on all other ratepayers, and will also inflict a vast amount of loss and injury upon many persons; and therefore urging the Government not to proceed with the measure, and inviting the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis to adopt a similar resolution. The Vestry expressed no opinion on the subject. Triangular Plot of Ground—Exmouth Street.— Some time ago the Vestry asked the County Council whether they would give the small triangular plot of ground at the junction of Rosebery Avenue and Exmouth Street for an open space or for an underground urinal, but they replied asking £550 for same. The Vestry thought the price prohibitive, and took no further action at that time. In October, they again approached the Council upon the matter, but received a reply that they were not willing to depart from their opinion of the price already named. The Vestry offered the sum of £100, but were informed that the offer was not one the Council could entertain. Fire Engine Station, Farringdon Road.— On the application of the County Council, the Vestry have agreed to the removal of the whole of the footway of the refuge in front and to the west of Nos. 1 and 3, Mount Pleasant by the Council granite carriageway being laid in its place, so as to allow the exit from the station to be into Rosebery Avenue instead of Farringdon Road. Fire Hydrants.—In November, the Vestry received a letter from the London County Council, 49 inviting them to appoint a representative to attend a conference to consider the desirability of applying to Parliament for powers to use the tire hydrants fixed under the provisions of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, for flushing and other purposes. Mr. Churchwarden Robson was appointed as such representative. Sewer Ventilators.—The Vestry fixed two sewer ventilators in the form of lamp-posts to ventilate the sewers in Northampton and Claremont Squares, and lamps were erected thereon. The Gas Company, however, called upon the Vestry to remove them as a source of danger, a view which the Vestry were unable to coincide with. They, however, removed the lamps, as their present interest in the matter was small, reserving the right to reopen the question at a subsequent date if they think fit to do so. Flushing Cisterns.—In January, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Secretary of the Sanitary Institute relating to the question of the supply of sufficient water for flushing w.c.'s, and enclosing a copy of a report of some investigations upon the subject which had recently been carried on by the Committee of the Institution, and stating that the results of the experiments tend to confirm the opinions expressed as to the inefficiency of the present limit of 2 gallons, and show that 3 and 3½ gallons is desirable. A copy of such report was furnished to each member of the Vestry. The Vestry were of opinion that if a 2-gallon cistern be properly fixed it will be sufficient, and they could not support the alteration from a 2-gallon to a 3 gallon flush. D 50 Lights on Vehicles at night.—In June a letter was received from the Vestry of St. Mary, Newington, expressing the opinion that all vehicles travelling over the streets of the Metropolis after dark should be compelled to carry a light, and stating that they have communicated same to the Commissioner of Police, and asking for the co-operation of the Vestry in the matter. The Vestry decided to co-operate in the matter as suggested, and ordered that at the same time the attention of the Chief Commissioner be called to the high rate of speed at which bicycles are ridden in the streets. The Commissioner replied, as follows:— "With reference to your letter of the 16th instant, forwarding a copy of a resolution passed by the Vestry as to the desirability of all vehicles travelling over the streets of the Metropolis after dark being compelled to carry a light, I am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you that the only Acts bearing on this subject are the 28th and 29th Vict., cap. 77, sec. 3, and 51 and 52 Vict., cap. 41, sec. 85, the former relating exclusively to locomotives and the latter to cycles. As regards the carrying of lights by other descriptions of vehicles, the law makes no provision; but as a matter of fact the majority of vehicles do carry a light after dark. "It may, perhaps, interest the Vestry to know that the great majority of accidents caused by vehicles in the streets of London occur in the day time. During the year 1892, 128 persons were killed in tbe streets in the day time and 15 during the night, while in the same year 4,806 persons were injured during the day time and 881 at night. These figures, though they are distressing enough, show that accidents during the night are not so numerous as is generally thought. Parish of the Charterhouse.—The Vestry have agreed to continue the removal of the house refuse from the Parish of the Charterhouse for £55 per annum, and to sweep Charterhouse Buildings and Foresters' Hall Place for per annum, and have further agreed to cleanse the gullies for £2 2s. per annum. 51 Price of Gas.- In July, 1893, the Vestry recaived a letter from the Vestry of St. Luke, inviting them to appoint three delegates to a conference to consider generally the increased charge for gas made by the Gras Light and Coke Company, and the anomalies existing in the matter of such charge as compared with those of other Companies; and farther to consider the desirability of endeavouring to secure a modification of the existing statutory rights of the Companies supplying gas to the Metropolis, with the object of reducing the statutory limit of dividend to be paid by the Company, and of securing uniformity in the price charged for gas consumed throughout the Metropolis ; and Mr. R. M. H. Griffith, Mr. Sans, and Mr. Walton were appointed as such delegates. The resolutions passed by the Conference were the following:— "That in the opinion of this Conference of Delegates from Vestries and District Boards of Parishes and Districts situate within the area of supply of the Gas Light and Coke Company, the time has arrived when the existing anomalies in the charges for gas supplied and use of meters by the several Companies supplying gas in the Metropolis should be removed, and that all gas supplied in the Metropolis to private consumers should be supplied at a uniform charge per 1000 feet, with the free use of meters." "This Conference is also of opinion it is desirable that a Parliamentary enquiry should be instituted into the present management and working of the various Gas Companies, their existing statutory rights and the past results, financial and general, of the statutory sliding scale of price and dividend, and that the existing limit of statutory dividend should now be modified in the direction of a reduction in the amount thereof." "That the Delegates to this Conference wait upon the President of the Board of Trade in support of the foregoing resolutions." "That copies of the resolutions passed by the Conference be transmitted to the several Vestries and District Boards which have appointed Delegates, and that those bodies be requested to support the proposals contained in such resolutions." 52 The Vestry concurred in such resolutions, and decided to co-operate in the manner suggested. The Vestry, in February, received a letter from the Guardians of the Poor of the Holborn Union, forwarding resolution protesting against the disproportion of 8d per 1000 feet in the price charged for gas on the north and south sides of the Thames respectively, and inviting the co-operation of the Vestry in the matter. The Vestry concurred, and wrote to the Gas Light and Coke Company ingty The Vestry subsequently decided to call a Public Meeting of the inhabitants upon the matter, the Meeting being held after the date at which this report closes. Railway Bridges.—Early in the year the Yestry received a letter from the County Council, stating that their attention has several times been called by local authorities and others to the condition of many of the railway bridges over thoroughfares in London. Some of the bridges are so wide that the thoroughfare under them is darkened for a considerable distance, and many of them are by no means watertight; and the Council were of opinion that considerable improvement might be effected if the railway companies were required by law to make all their bridges watertight, to provide openings between old and new portions of widened bridges, to face the walls underneath the bridges with white glazed bricks or tiles, and to make provisions for deadbning, as far as possible, the noise of passing trains; and the Council stated that they had resolved to endeavour to get clauses for these purposes inserted in all bills promoted by railway companies, and would be glad if the various 53 local authorities would do all they could to second the Council's efforts. The Vestry replied that they approved of the action of the Council, and would be willing to assist in the matter as far as possible. Lighting Common Staircases.—In September the attention of the Vestry was called to a newspaper report of an inquest on a person who died from falling down the dark staircase of a house in Clerkenwell Green. The staircase was found to be very dark at the bottom and dangerous, being lighted from a skylight in the roof. The owner was communicated with, and undertook to carry out certain work to remedy the cause of danger. The attention of the County Council was then again called to the question of lighting dark staircases, and they replied in November that their Parliamentary Committee was taking steps to procure a clause in a public general Bill, providing for the proper lighting of such staircases. A clause was introduced into their General Powers Bill for the purpose, and in March the Council asked the Yestry to depute some member to give evidence in favour of the Bill before a House of Commons Committee, and Mr. Walton, the Chairman of the Works Committee, was appointed. The matter was at this stage at the close of the year. Baths and Washhouses.—The Committee appointed to consider the desirability of the Yestry adopting the Baths and Washhouses Acts has not yet reported Negotiations were opened on behalf of the Holbom District Board with the view to the joint provision of such an establishment by the two Parishes, but the Board was subsequently advised that it had no authority to take any steps in the matter. 54 Electric Lighting.—The Vestry in December, 1892, referred it to the Works Committee to consider the question of the desirability of the Vestry undertaking the electric lighting in the Parish, and to ascertain how far the Orders obtained by Companies for lighting the Parish would affect the question. The Committee reported that the Board of Trade had power to grant a license or provisional order, notwithstanding any previous license or grant of authority to any Company. The Board of Trade stated in reply to enquiry that they were unable to say whether they would be prepared to entertain an application from the Yestry until they had ascertained what steps the Companies which had obtained orders had taken or proposed to take to give effect to their orders. The Committee also received a letter from the London Electric Supply Corporation, which had obtained an order, offering to surrender their rights in the Parish for the sum of £1,200. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Committee reported that in their opinion it was not desirable for the Vestry to take any steps at present to supply this Parish with electric light—an opinion which the Yestry endorsed. Clerkenwell Detached.—The proposal of the Local Government Board to transfer the detached portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill to Hornsey has been proceeded with and decided during the year. The last report stated that a sufficient number of the ratepayers had objected to the Order of the Local Government Board, which thereupon became provisional only, and required confirmation by Parliament. Early in May a Bill to confirm the Order was introduced into the House of Commons. The Yestry and the London County Council presented Petitions against the Bill, and the Vestry communicated with all the London Members of Parliament 55 asking their support. The Bill was opposed, but in consequence of a consultation between Mr. Sandeman, Mr. Baxter, Mr. J. W. Benn, M.P., Mr. Boyce, the Solicitor of the Local Government Board, and Mr. Naoroji, M.P., it was agreed that opposition to the second reading of the Bill should be withdrawn, that the Bill should be referred to a Hybrid Committee, and that the County Council, whose petition had not been lodged in time, should be allowed to petition. The Bill came before a Committee of the House of Commons on the 15th June, and was passed; the Counsel for the Local Government Board stating that the question of compensation was one which it would be the duty of the Local Government Board to consider hereafter. Mr. Sandeman, in conversation with the solicitor of the Local Government Board subsequently, elicited from him that, as the balance against the Vestry was made up of amounts already paid for out of the rates, no account would be taken of same in adjusting the liabilities, and the Vestry therefore thought it necessary to appear before a Committee of the House of Lords, to endeavour to get a compensation clause inserted in the Bill. The Bill came before a Committee of the House of Lords on Thursday and Friday, the 13th and 14th July, the London County Council also opposing, and the Middlesex County Council appearing in opposition to any addition being made to the Bill which might have the effect of adding to the burden of the County of Middlesex; the result being that the Committee decided that the preamble was not proved. At the conclusion of the case, Mr. Sandeman and the Vestry Clerk had an interview with Mr. Costelloe, L.C.C., and officials of the Engineer's and Solicitor's departments of the County 56 Council with reference to the long standing question of the drainage. Mr. Costelloe expressed the opinion that the Council might now report to the Local Government Board that they were unable to agree with the surrounding parishes with regard to such drainage; in which case it would become the duty of the Local Government Board, under the Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Act, 1887, after enquiry to determine the matter, and he expressed his intention of forthwith bringing the question before the Council in that form. The proceedings for severance being at an end, at any rate for the present, the Vestry took steps to minimise, as far as possible, the inconveniences which the inhabitants of the detached portion of the parish had complained of. After the drainage, the principal cause of complaint appeared to be that there was no local public vaccinator, nor registrar of births and deaths. These being matters under the jurisdiction of the Guardians of the Poor, the Vestry communicated with them, with the view to their making local appointments for the purpose. It was obvious in the course of the proceedings before the Parliamentary Committees that the Vestry was seriously prejudiced, from a pecuniary point of view, by the fact that payments for permanent improvements had been paid for from current rates instead of by loans, it appearing that only debts and liabilities would form part of a financial adjustment under the present law. The Vestry therefore took steps to protect the Parish as far as possible for the future, and they obtained a loan for the cost of the surface water drain, &c., recently laid. Cholera.—In view of a possible epidemic of Cholera reaching the Parish, the Committee 57 appointed last year was re-appointed, and the precautionary measures then taken were again put in force. In September a letter was received from the Local Government Board, requesting the revision of the arrangements contemplated in the event of Cholera being introduced into the district, with the view to those arrangements being promptly brought into operation if the necessity should occur. The matter was further considered, and the Local Government Board was informed that the arrangements were as complete as it was possible to make them. An alleged case of cholera occurred at No. 17, Chapel Street on the 8th September. The following is the Medical Officer's report on the matter:— The patient was a man aged 24 years. He had been poorly for some weeks, and for the previous fortnight had been suffering from bad attacks of Diarrhoea. He was a printer out of employment. On Friday morning, the 8th, the attacks of Diarrhoea became more violent and much more frequent, and whilst out in the street he was so severely attacked that he had to be taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. This was at 10 a.m. The first notification the Vestry had of the case was by a registered letter, received at the Vestry on the 9th. Within an hour of its receipt seven men were set to work on the house, and handbills, showing where temporary accommodation for the inmates could be had, were distributed. Subsequently, three dirty old mattrasses were burned; the whole of the bedding and clothes in the infected floor were baked; every room in the house was thoroughly fumigated, and the walls, ceilings, floors and woodwork were washed with carbolic acid, and the papers stripped and burnt. The house has a constant service of water. The patient recovered, and no fresh illness occurred in the house. The opinion that the case was one of cholera was not confirmed by the bacteriological examination. Infectious Hospitals.—In May, 1893, the Vestry received a letter from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, forwarding copy communication to the Local Government Board respecting the urgent 58 need of more Infectious Hospitals for the Metropolis, and the difficulty experienced in providing suitable sites for such Hospitals, owing to the local opposition which arises; and intimating that as their accommodation for fever patients may shortly become exhausted, the Vestry may be called upon to make provision for their own infectious sick. The Vestry, in reply, urged the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide the necessary accommodation as soon as possible. The Vestry of St. Marylebone invited the appointment of two delegates to a conference on Wednesday, 28th June, with the object of forming a deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board, to urge them to facilitate the acquisition of sites by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or the provision of suitable buildings. The Vestry appointed Mr. Putterill and Mr. Dixie as such delegates. The conference passed a resolution, as follows:— That in view of the urgent necessity cf further provision being made for the rapidly increasing number of persons suffering from infectious disease, and the declared inability of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide the necessary accommodation, this Conference do appoint a deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board for the purpose of urging them to facilitate the acquisition of sites by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or the provision of suitable buildings. The Local Government Board has since sanctioned the erection of two more hospitals. In consequence of the want of accommodation, many infectious cases in the Parish were unable to be removed to hospital. Metropolitan Asylums Board.—In February, 1894, the Vestry received a letter from the Guardians of the Strand Union, forwarding copy 59 Petition presented by them to the House of Commons, praying for an enquiry by a Select Committee into the constitution and expenditure of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and inviting the Vestry's co-operation in the matter. The Vestry concurred with the views of the Strand Guardians, and presented a similar petition to the House of Commons. St. John's Gate.—An event in the history of the Parish, which may well find a place in these pages, though the Vestry were not immediately concerned, was the visit of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Cambridge, and other members of the Royal Family to St. John's Gate, on the 24th June, 1893, when a Memorial to H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale was unveiled by the Prince of Wales, Grand Prior of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem in England. Hugh Myddelton School.—His Royal Highness, accompanied by the Duke of York, again visited the Parish on the 13th December, (the twenty-sixth anniversary of the Fenian Explosion), when he formally opened the Hugh Myddelton School. built by the School Board on the site of the Middlesex House of Detention. Marriage of H.R.H. the Duke of York.—On the occasion of the marriage of H.R.H. the Duke of York and H.S.H. the Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, on the 6th July, 1893, the Vestry Hall, in common with a large number of public and private buildings throughout the Metropolis, was illuminated, and a holiday was granted to the staff. 60 Coffins in St. John's Crypt.—In March, 1803, the attention of the Vestry was called to offensive smells arising from the coffins in the crypt of St. John's Church, and it was referred to the Sanitary Committee to consider the desirability of steps being taken to remove them. The Medical Officer of Health reported to the Committee as follows:— In response to your request to report upon the condition of the crypt of St. John's Church, I beg to state as follows:—Complaint has been made of offensive effluvia in the crypt, also in some adjacent premises. I find mephitic fumes well marked both to the eight and to the smell. Some twenty years ago, the coffins and remains were collected and enclosed in a brick vault where they have since remained. The offensive effluvia have been constantly accumulating; on opening the brick vault the coffins and remains were found decayed away, so that individually they would be quite unrecognisable. I, therefore, advise the Vestry to get these remains removed from the crypt as soon as possible, for they are certainly a nuisance and dangerous and prejudicial to those using the building. The Committee recommended the Vestry to assist the Churchwardens of St. John in obtaining the necessary permission, by faculty or otherwise, to have the bodies removed, which the Vestry approved. The Churchwardens of St. John then applied to the Home Secretary for an order for their removal, and on the 19th. August Dr. Hoffman inspected the crypt on his behalf, and on the 23rd November an Order of the Queen in Council was issued requiring that the whole of the human remains now lying in the crypt beneath the Church of St. John, Clerkenwell, be removed under the supervision and to the satisfaction of Dr. J. W. Griffith, the Medical Officer of Health for Clerkenwell, and forthwith reburied in the consecrated part of Woking Cemetery. 61 The Order being brought to the notice of the Vestry was referred to the Public Health Committee for consideration and report, who recommended that authority be given to them to assist the Churchwardens of St. John to carry it out; bat the recommendation, after considerable discussion, was negatived. The matter was at this stage at the period when this report closes. The Unemployed.—The Vestry, in common with many other local authorities of the Metropolis, have been considering the question of the unemployed during the year. In March, 1893, the Local Government Board asked for particulars of the various schemes of work which. in connexion with distress arising from want of employment, have been recently undertaken by local authorities in different parts of the country. The Vestry replied that such of their ordinary work as could be properly carried on during the winter had been done, but that they had found themselves unable to undertake any special or exceptional work for the purpose; and also that a labour registry had been founded. On the 14th September a deputation of the unemployed attended the Vestry, requesting that the Vestry would find work for persons out of employment; that they would communicate with the Government, asking for further powers of employment, and also asking that sums of money might be granted from the Imperial funds for the purpose of relief works. The deputation having retired, the Vestry passed resolutions as follows:—"That the Vestry petition 62 the Government, asking them to introduce legislation to give local authorities further powers of employment, and to make grants out of the Imperial funds to the local authorities to be spent in relief works; and in the interests of the working men of this country, many thousands of whom are at all times unable to obtain employment, to take steps to prohibit the immigration of workmen from foreign countries, who cannot show means of support at the port of debarkation; that the Vestry undertake to find as much work as possible during the winter months for parishioners of Clerkenwell of twelve months' standing, and that the question of finding such work be referred to the Works Committee." All that was possible to be done was duly carried out. London (Equalization of Rates) Bill.—In the Session of 1893 the Government introduced this Bill. It proposed to make better provision for the equalization of rates as between the different parts of London, and provided that in every year the London County Council should form a fund equal to a rate of sixpence in the pound on the whole rateable value, the contributions to this fund being apportioned among the parishes in proportion to their rateable value, and the grants from it being made to the various sanitary districts in proportion to their population, with the exception that where the total contribution from the parishes in the district is less than the grant apportioned to the district the difference is to be paid out of the fund to the sanitary authority of the district, and no payment towards any equalization charge is to be required from any parish in the district. Where the contribution from a parish is less than the grant due, the difference is to be paid out of the fund to 63 the sanitary authority of the district forming or comprising the parish; but if the contribution exceeds the grant due to the parish the London County Council will be empowered to levy on the parish for the purpose of meeting the excess a county contribution as a separate item of the county rate. The sums paid under the Bill were to be applied first in defraying expenses under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and so far as not required for that purpose, those incurred in respect of lighting, and so far as not required for that purpose, those incurred in respect of streets. The Bill would relieve the rates of Clerkenwell by about £4,000 a year, equal to a rate of nearly 3d in the pound. The Yestry presented a petition in its favour, but it was eventually dropped, to be reintroduced in the ensuing Session. District Councils.—The last annual report recorded the fact that a Bill to established Parish and District Councils was introduced into Parliament by Mr. Fowler, President of the Local Government Board, in March, 1893, but that no further progress had then been made. The Government, however, proceeded with it through an autumn session, and in Committee of the House of Commons introduced a clause which applied its provisions as to the qualification of electors and of the persons to be elected, and the mode of election, to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. Other amendments of the law governing these bodies were also inserted in the Bill. These clauses, with others, were struck out by the House of Lords, but were re-inserted by the Commons; and the Bill, much altered from its original shape, received the Royal Assent on the 5th March, 1894. The following is a brief statement of the principal 64 effects of the Act in regard to the Parish of Clerkenwell:— The present Vestry will continue in office until November or December, 1894 (Sec. 79), and will then all go out of office. An entirely new Vestry will then be elected, of whom the third lowest on the poll will remain in office until May, 1896, the the next third until May, 1897, and the highest third until May, 1898. Should there be no poll in any Ward, the question of retirement will be decided by the Vestry by ballot (Sec. 79). With regard to the persons eligible for election, all rating qualification will cease. Any person, male or female, whose name appears on the register of electors in the Parish, including householders, lodgers, service franchise voters, ownership voters, and any person who has during the whole of the preceding twelve months resided in the Parish will be eligible for election (Sec. 23). The electors will be not only the ratepayers direct and indirect who form the electorate for the County Council, but also lodgers, service voters, and ownership voters (Sec. 44). The elections will be conducted under the provisions of the Ballot Act, 1872, the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, and Part IV. of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, subject to rules to be framed by the Local Government Board (Sec. 48). The ex-officio Chairmanship of the Vicar will cease, and at. the first meeting after the Annual Elections the Vestry will appoint a Chairman for the year (Sec. 31), who will be by virtue of his office a Justice of the Peace for the County of London (Sec. 22). 65 It will be competent for the Vestry to apply to the Local Government Board to make an order conferring on the Vestry the appointment of overseers and assistant overseers, the revocation of appointment of assistant overseers, the powers, duties, and liabilities of Overseers, and the powers, duties, and liabilities of a Parish Council (Sec. 33). The attention of the Parishioners has been called to the alterations in the law, by a statement printed upon the rate notices. By order, R. E. PAGET Vestry Clerk.

Dusting.—During the year 9429 loads of dust and 608 loads of trade refuse have been removed from the Parish. After sifting same, 138 freights of ashes and breeze, containing 8916 chaldrons have been removed from the Wharf, for which a sum of £527 6s. 6d. has been received, being an average of £3 16s. 5d. per freight, as compared with £3 6s. 10d., £3 14s. 0d., and £3 13s. 8d., for the three previous years. 21 freights of hardcore have been removed, for which barges have been hired at a cost of £95 3s. 0d. The following is a statement of the cost of disposal of the dust for the year:— 85  £ s. d. £ s. d. 9429 Loads of Dust sifted 786 13 0 Less Rags, Bones, &c., sold 176 3 3 £610 9 9 21 Freights of Hardcore removed £95 3 0 Cost of Loading same 23 15 10 Tools 8 9 10 Removal of old Tins 12 4 0 139 12 8 8982 Chaldrons of Ashes and Breeze sold 543 18 10 750 2 5 Less Cost of Loading 112 5 6 431 13 4 Nett Cost £318 9 1 9429 Loads of Dust at £318 9s. 1d. is equal to 8d. per load against 7½d. last year, and 10¾ the previous year. Street Sweepings.—During the year 6642 loads of street sweepings and dung were removed from the parish, 484 of which were collected on Sunday mornings. 146 freights were barged away at a cost of £273 14s. 0d. There is a decrease of 1722 in the number of loads removed, to be largely accounted for by the prolonged dry season. The Vestry decided, early in the year, to alter the system of sweeping the streets, and to sweep them at night instead of in the daytime, and at the same time to have the sweepings shot direct into barges instead of their being shot on the wharf and afterwards loaded into the barges. The change necessitated a contract being made for a constant supply of barges, and the gross cost of same has therefore considerably increased, but the increase has been more than met by the saving in other directions, as the quarterly reports of the Wharf Superintendent show. 80 Watering.—The greater part of the watering was done by the Vestry staff, but on IS days between May 9th and August 18th, an average of 3.15 horses per day were hired from Mr. Varney for the purpose at a cost of £77 19s. 3d. The following represents the cost of the watering for the season of 1898, that for 1892 being added for the purpose of comparison:— Season 1892. Season 1898. Vestry Carmen's Wages £21 9 0 £128 12 0 Repairs to Water Vans 84 0 0 84 0 0 Keep of Horses, &c. 11 11 9 118 6 0 Cost of water and meter rent (5,020,000 gals.) 209 5 10(4.481.000 galls.) 190 4 1 Repairs to Standposts 17 8 9 37 16 8 Horse Hire, including Wages of Drivers 824 8 9 77 19 8 £667 19 1 £631 18 6 Cartage.- The horses and carts have also been employed during the year in carting stone, refuse from gullies, and rubbish. Had horses and carts been hired for the purpose a cost of £211 17s. 10d. would have been incurred. Horses.—On the 27th June, 1898, the horse "Martin," purchased in May, 1880, was destroyed, having become unfit for further work, and on the 4 th July the horse "Meyer," purchased in March, 1881, was also destroyed, having also become unfit for further work. On the 14th July a dapple grey gelding and a bay mare were purchased in their places, for the sum of £125, of Mr. Seymour, of Luton. The total number of the stud remains at 27. 87 Furnace.—It has been found necessary to effect considerable repairs to the furnace, and the work has been done by Messrs. Kemp and Son, at a cost of £82 12s. Vans and Carts.—The number of vans and carts belonging to the Vestry is—20 vans, 8 carts, 12 water vans, and 2 sweeping machines. Fodder.—The Fodder account amounts to £1458 3s. 5d., an increase of £305, being an average of 22s per horse per week, an increase from last year of 4s 6d per horse per week. This increase has been caused by the great advance in the price of fodder, especially of hay, straw and clover, due to the prolonged drought in the early part of 1893. The contract entered into for the supply of fodder for the half-year ending 29th September was at 105s. per load for hay, 42s. for straw, and 110s. for clover, which were prices considerably above those ordinarily ruling, but at the expiration of the contract hay was 155s , straw 50s , clover 152s. 6d. The prices of hay and clover were afterwards slightly reduced, but straw continued to rise, 60s. being paid in January and February In the early part of the present year the Vestry commenced to purchase foreign hay at 125s. and 130s. per load.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Surveyor's Office, Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 11th October, 1894. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Report upon the works, &c., executed by the Vestry during the year ending Lady-day, 1894. SEWERS AND GULLIES. 28 sewers were cleansed and repaired. 1 new side entrance cover fixed. 7 new gullies constructed. 623 gullies cleansed and repaired. 4 gullies trapped. 2 new gully drains laid. 15 new gully grates fixed. 3 patent gully tops fixed. 2 flushing boxes fixed, 3 new flushed shafts constructed. 1 new ventilating grating fixed. G 94 150 loads of deposit were removed from the sewers and gullies. 45 private drains were let off by the sewermen at the expense of the owners of the premises upon which the drains were stopped, lor which the sum of £4 10s. was received by the Vestry. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. A ventilating shaft was constructed in Coburg Street, consent having been obtained to carry a pipe up the back of the premises at the corner of Coburg Street and Skinner Street. A ventilating column was fixed in Northampton Square gardens, opposite Smith Street; and one at the S.E. corner of the reservoir in Claremont Square. NEW SEWERS. About 35 feet of 12-in. pipe sewer was laid in William Street in place of a defective brick barrel sewer. About 20 feet of 12-in. pipe sewer was laid in Field Place, in place of defective brick barrel About 180 feet of 9-in. pipe sewer was laid at the rear of Nos. 51, 53, and 55, Penton Street and St. Silas Church, to connect with the sewer in Risinghill Street. Complaint having been made by the Cannon Brewery Company of the defective condition of the sewer passing through their premises, and a request 95 that the sewer might be diverted, a 12-in. pipe sewer with two manholes was constructed from where the sewer crossed Compton Passage and connected with the existing sewer at the corner of Allen Street and Berry Street; the drainage from Messrs. Buteux's Foundry and adjoining premises was also connected with the new sewer. The Cannon Brewery Company agreed to pay half the total cost of the works. The occupier of 144, St. John Street having complained of a brick barrel sewer passing under his premises, the Yestry laid a 12-in. pipe sewer from the sewer in St. John Street to the line of frontage, and the occupier continued the pipes through his premises. A 12-in. pipe sewer, 120 feet in length, was laid in Lloyds Row from the main line sewer in St. John Street Road to the existing sewer opposite No. 36, Lloyds Row, and a manhole constructed. A portion of the old sewer passing at the rear of the houses in Allen Street and Compton Street having become useless owing to the drainage of the premises being diverted, it was broken up and filled in with rubbish. A new 4-ft. by 2-ft. 6-in. sewer was constructed in Woodbridge Street from Hayward's Place to Aylesbury Street, and the sewer in Hayward's Place was destroyed; this work was carried out entirely at the expense of Messrs. Nicholson & Co. 96 The whole of the pipe sowers in the Parish were Unshod by water supplied by the Now River Company, and the brick sewers, where practicable, by water from the main sewers being turned through them by means of (lushing gates fixed in the sewers for that purpose. COURT AND GULLY FLUSHING. The Courts and Alloys in the Parish were washed and sprinkled with Carbolic Acid at frequent intervals during the year, whenever considered necessary by the Medical Officer of Health; the carriageways of Chapel Street and Exmouth Street were washed during the hot weather, and the Gullies during the exceptionally dry weather were also flushed, at a cost of £125 including water and carbolic acid. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The total number of premises drained was 105, (including 3 houses in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill, and 8 houses in Goswell Road, situate in Islington Parish). The details of such drainage are shown upon 137 plans prepared for that purpose and deposited in the Surveyor's Office. Tho drainage of the Cannon Brewery was entirely reconstructed. These drains consist of 1 12-in., 7 9-in., and 144 6-in. The amount of fees received for making the connections of the new drains to the sewers was £147 6s. 0d. 97 198 drains were tested. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Orders for houses to be drained by a combined operation were made in the following cases:— 2 and 3, Garnault Place 38, 39 and 39a, Rawstorne Street 11, 13, 15 and 17, North Street 16 and 17, Baker Street 28 and 29, Baker Street 94 to 104, Rosoman Street 11 and 12, Thomas Street 18, Baker Street and 29, St. Helena Place URINALS.

The number of deaths occurring from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1893 was 1,183. The annual average for the last ten years was 1,174; bo that the deaths were 9 more than the average. The deaths in 1892 having been 1,125, those in 1893 were 58 more than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— deaths. bibths. 1884 1,303 2.448 1885 1,195 2,390 1886 1,170 2,279 1887 1,216 2,263 1888 1,168 2,311 1889 1,033 2,277 1890 1,184 2,204 1891 1,171 2,222 1892 1,125 2,175 1893 1,183 2.106 122 The births were 69 less than in the preceding year, and 171 less than the average.

St. James 296 515 219 Amwell 268 508 240 Pentonville 336 553 217 Goswell 287 530 243 In each year a number of deaths of parishioners takes place in General and Special Hospitals, in the Workhouses, and in the Infirmaries, all of which are extra-parochial. The number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals was 279 ; in the Workhouses, 128; and in the Infirmary, 144; making a total of 551. The numbers, causes and ages of the deaths are given in the tables appended to this report. The Population of the Parish has increased by the occupation of new buildings, since the census of 1891; but taking the numbers of that census, the intra-parochial mortality amounts to 17 per 1000; including the Workhouses, Infirmary, and the Hospital deaths, to 26 per 1,000. The deaths occurring in the out-lying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill, are enumerated with those of the Pentonville subdistrict. The mortality of all London during the year was 21.8 per 1,000; that of the West districts being 19.7; of the North districts, 20.2; of the Central districts, 25.7; of the East districts, 24.9; and of the South districts, 15.9. The number of deaths arising from the principal Zymotic diseases in the Parish in 1893 was 203; 84 more than in the preceding year. 123 The number and the causes of the deaths from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last ten years are exhibited in the following table:— small pox. measles. scarlet fever. diphtheria. whping.cough. typhoid fever. diarrhœa. totals. 1884 6 48 15 12 69 7 79 236 1885 6 87 14 7 52 5 58 229 1886 0 18 8 4 42 7 93 172 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 1889 0 47 10 6 23 4 54 144 1890 0 33 5 2 64 6 62 172 1891 0 107 4 7 51 4 50 223 1892 0 40 3 6 39 9 28 119 1893 0 70 11 25 41 6 50 203 89 deaths also occurred from Zymotic Diseases in extra-parochial Hospitals, viz.:—6 from measles, 18 from scarlet fever, 44 from diphtheria, 8 from whooping cough, 5 from typhoid fever, and 8 from diarrhoea. The average number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 194, so that the number for 1893 was nine more than the average. It must be observed, however, that the deaths from these diseases occurring in tho hospitals is larger than last year, shewing that more of the cases are removed to hospitals than previously. 124 The number of deaths arising in the Parish from all causes in infants under one year, was 396 ; extra parochial, 41. 220 deaths occurred in the Parish at and above 60; 146 extra parochial. 30 deaths arose from violence. 97 inquests were held in the year, 59 less than in the preceding year.

The Meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1893. temperature. aveRage. difference from average of 122 years. humidity saturation=100.) height of barometer. rain in inches. difference from average of 78 years. Year 51.1 + 2.5 76 29.8 20.1 —4.2 Winter Quarter 40.9 + 21 84 29.7 4.6 —0.35 (Jan., Feb., March) Spring Quarter 57.0 +4.7 65 29.9 1.4 —4.31 (April, May, June) Summer Quarter 61.9 + 2.2 71 29.7 5.8 —1.44 (July, Aug., Sept.) Autumn Quarter 44.5 + 1.6 84 29.7 8.1 + 1.12 (Oct., Nov., Dec.) The meteorological conditions have an important influence upon the public health, for, while an increase of summer temperature increases the deaths from diarrhoea, a lower temperature diminishes them; and, while a cold winter inoreases the pulmonary deaths, a mild winter diminishes them. The amount of rainfall is also important, as this washes and purifies the streets and drains. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. W.
