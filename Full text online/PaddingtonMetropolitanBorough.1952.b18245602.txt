Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1952. Readers of this record of the work of the Public Health Department are accustomed to note slow, steady and unspectacular progress towards better health and improved environmental conditions for those living in the borough. It is seldom that in any one year a marked change can be observed in a particular field. Even over longer periods of, say, five or ten years it may not be easy to discern either improvement or deterioration and when the effect of unexplainable factors obtrudes, the interpretation of the figures presented may be difficult. A notable exception has been the incidence and death rate of diphtheria, both figures now reaching vanishing point. This satisfactory position has been commented on in previous reports and attention drawn to the need to maintain this high degree of immunity by continuous attention to immunisation campaigns. The statistics for this year suggest that the diphtheria figures may be joined by the tuberculosis figures in showing remarkable progress. The tuberculosis notification rate has been constant during the last three years. There have been a succession of mass X-ray examinations in the borough. These surveys bring to light cases of tuberculosis which might otherwise remain undetected. One would expect an increase in the number of cases notified, but in spite of the investigations carried out by the mass X-ray Unit the notification rate is stationary. The number of deaths from tuberculosis was 33, the lowest figure recorded in the borough, which is 22 less than the previous lowest, 55 in 1950. It would be prudent at this point to warn that this may be a temporary improvement, that many times in the past improvements have not been maintained. On the other hand the greatly improved treatment by antibiotics, the other new drugs, improved surgical technique, the introduction of B.C.G. on a large scale, the improved social services available for tuberculous patients should lead to improvement and we should expect the improvement to be evident again in future reports. In the last month of the year London experienced one of the worst fogs on record, and there was a considerable increase in the number of deaths recorded at this time. The fog and the resultant deaths affected an area much wider than the borough and is to be the subject of intensive study. It would therefore be premature to make further comment at this time. The birth rate shows a further fall, but the number of illegitimate births remains regrettably high. This is a subject which requires enquiry. On the credit side mention must be made of the very low infant mortality figures among illegitimate children. The usual experience is to find a high infant death rate among the illegitimate which adversely affects the infant mortality as a whole. The reverse has been the case this year, the figures for the illegitimate infants helping to produce a low infant mortality rate generally. The large number of cases of measles indicates an epidemic, but the 1952 figures alone do not give a complete picture, the high incidence being carried on into 1953. The difficulty experienced in obtaining adequate repairs to a certain class of property has been a source of concern for several years. Property may deteriorate rapidly and become unfit for human habitation because the owner has no funds. In certain cases the Council can, and does, carry out repairs, recovering the cost by Housing Act procedure. This can be done only where the Council can recover the cost from the rents in a reasonable time. Experience has shown that the number of properties which can be dealt with in this manner is limited and as the cost of repairs increases and the rents remain static there seems little hope of expanding the use of this method in the future. It is important to remember that housing accommodation can be lost because there is no authority available to spend say some hundreds of pounds to maintain property in occupation, which, if demolished, will cost thousands to replace. Admittedly the hundreds spent will not produce property with as long a life as new property, but it would prevent the loss of accommodation already in occupation. This subject has been touched on in previous reports and one would have imagined that the saving of existing accommodation would have been as valuable as the building of new and that there might be sound financial reasons for trying to do this. However, successive governments have failed to see any attraction in the idea and no action has been taken. The problem is so bound up with the Rent Restrictions Acts that it may be unreasonable to expect an early solution. The visits paid by the Lady Visitors show a considerable increase, particularly in the number of visits paid to old people, from 241 in 1951 to 561 in 1952. This increase is related to the reconstituted Old People's Welfare Committee and the appointment of an Organiser. The Lady Visitors receive much valuable information from the Organiser which has resulted in the larger number of visits paid. It is hoped to give a fuller account of these activities in the next annual report. The section dealing with the Holiday Home will be of interest to many. My best wishes go to my successor, Dr. H. L. Oldershaw, who, by reason of his dual appointment, will be able to link the work of the Borough with that of the County to their mutual advantage. It is my final and pleasant duty to express my most sincere thanks to the Members of the Council, to my colleagues in other departments, and to the Public Health Department staff for the help, support, and friendliness which it has been my happy privilege to receive during the last six years. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. 4 PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS (on December 31st, 1952).— Medical Officer of Health:— Deputy Medical Officer of Health:— A.

Smallpox cases are visited by the male Sanitary Inspectors, food poisoning or suspected food poisoning by the Food Inspectors, puerperal pyrexia, ophthalmia neonatorum and infective enteritis by the London County Councils Health Visitors, and tuberculosis by the Nurses at the Chest Clinic. Visits to cases of infectious disease paid by the male Sanitary Inspectors numbered 29 (193) all of which were to smallpox contacts referred to us by Port Authorities or under the Aircraft Regulations. During the year 331 certificates of inoculation and vaccination were submitted for the doctor's signature to be authenticated. 9 TUBERCULOSIS. Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1952.—These Regulations came into force on the 1st May, 1952 and revoke the 1930 Regulations. They continued to make cases of tuberculosis notifiable but the other powers and duties formerly given to sanitary authorities were not replaced as they " had become outdated and at variance with the present structure and operation of the tuberculosis services." Notifications.— The numbers of cases notified are shown in the following table :— Year Population Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Total Cases Incidence Rate (all forms) per 1,000 Pop. 1911 142,541 397 No record 397 pul. 2.8 1921 145,600 244 91 335 2.3 1931 140,300 213 87 300 2.1 1939 135,300 189 32 221 1.0 1940 97,860 168 37 205 2.1 1941 77,640 184 26 210 2.7 1942 83,640 195 40 235 2.8 1943 90,580 229 28 257 2.8 1944 93,030 233 26 259 2.8 1945 99,790 224 21 245 2.5 1946 117,670 261 24 285 2.4 1947 127,450 273 22 295 2.3 1948 128,100 306 23 329 2.6 1949 130,640 305 28 333 2.5 1950 130,600 246 23 269 2.1 1951 125,400 233 32 265 2.1 1952 124.800 241 26 267 2 .1 The following cases came to the knowledge of the Department during the year otherwise than by notification.

There is a Special Clinic at St. Mary's Hospital. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948-1952. Section 47.—Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. The Lady Visitors made 561 (241) visits in connection with aged persons. One old lady was removed to hospital under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act and remained there for the statutory three weeks. Meanwhile her room was cleaned and her affairs put in order. Since she returned home no further complaint or request for assistance has been made and recent enquiries showed her to be in fair health. Section 50—Burial or cremation of the dead.—During the year 30 (39) burials and one (—) cremation were arranged. MORTUARY.—Details of the work at the mortuary are given below :— Bodies received at mortuary 398 (356) Inquests held 98 (108) Coroner's certificates issued 283 (239) Post mortem examinations made 326 (309) Bodies received to await burial 17 (9) The improvement of the very poor reception and viewing facilities at the Council's Mortuary is still receiving the energetic attention of the Public Health Committee. The previous difficulties in connection with obtaining a Faculty which the original proposals required have now been overcome by the adoption of an alternative scheme entirely within the precincts of the Mortuary grounds, and a tender has been accepted for the necessary works. WATER SUPPLY.—One (—) water supply certificate was issued under Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The water supply was cut off by the Metropolitan Water Board in five (seven) cases on account of wastage or non-payment of rates and the Council notified in accordance with Section 98 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Two of the premises concerned were found to be empty and the water was reinstated in the remaining three cases. Five (eight) complaints of the quality of the water supply were received. Nothing injurious to health was found. Appropriate action was taken by the Inspectors in each case and no further complaints were received. FUMIGATION SERVICE AND CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS ROOMS.— Number of rooms fumigated for vermin by the Council 15 (19) Number of rooms sprayed for vermin by the Council 1,523 (1,193) Number of notices served under section 123 of the Public Health (London), Act, 1936 1 (1) Seriously bug-infested rooms are now rarely found in the Borough owing to the higher standards of the public and the greater efficacy of modern control methods. There has been, however, a considerable increase in the requests for assistance in dealing with cockroaches. This pest is one of the most difficult and expensive to control but a fair degree of success has been achieved in all cases. DISINFECTING STATION AND MEDICINAL BATHS.— Disinfection carried out :— Weight of goods passed through the steam disinfector 11 tons (12J tons) Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 226 (305) Number of library books disinfected 605 (581) Scabies :— Number of adults treated 105 (143) Number of children treated 8 (17) Number of treatments given 185 (262) Vermin :— Heads Bodies Number of adults treated 92 (126) 138 (189) Number of children treated 51 (66) 12 (—) School children receive treatment at the London County Council Cleansing Station and where necessary this Department is requested to investigate contacts or home conditions. 12 SMOKE NUISANCE.—Six (5) complaints regarding smoke nuisance were received during the year. It was necessary to serve a notice in only one case. Legal proceedings were taken for failure to comply with this notice and a Prohibition Order made and costs awarded to the Council. At a further hearing towards the end of the year a penalty was imposed for non-compliance with the Prohibition Order. PIGEONS.—No (4) complaints were received. Section 121 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, authorises the Council to destroy or cause to be destroyed any ownerless pigeons which are causing a nuisance. Two persons have been authorised to destroy pigeons in the Borough. Anyone complaining of a nuisance from pigeons is referred to these pigeon catchers who do their work without cost to the Council. Advice about measures which can be taken to prevent the birds settling or nesting on the buildings is given by the Inspectors concerned. FACTORIES.—Following is a table showing the work carried out during the year under the Factories Act, 1937.

One (1) clearance certificate was applied for. This was not granted. DRAINAGE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.—During the year 274 (229) plans were submitted for drainage work in existing buildings. COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—The Lady Sanitary Inspector made 1 (2) visit to Cecil House, which has 66 beds and is the only common lodging house in the Borough. Visits were paid by a Male Sanitary Inspector to examine the fire escape arrangements. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACTS.—At the end of the year the Register contained the names of 115 (110) persons entitled to sell the poisons scheduled in Part II of the Poisons List. CANAL BOATS.—The canal boats inspector visited Paddington Basin on 40 (48) occasions during 1952 and made 26 (31) inspections of canal boats. Four notices were served and complied with. One girl of school age was found to be living on boats coming into the Basin. No deaths were registered in Paddington and no cases of infectious disease reported from among the canal boat population. BAKEHOUSES.—The number of bakehouses in the Borough increased by one to twenty-seven. There are now 8 (8) " underground " and 19 (18) " level " bakehouses. They are constantly inspected, 195 (193) visits being paid. A smoke nuisance and breaches of the Food and Drugs Act were found in one instance which are reported upon elsewhere in this Report. RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out during the year under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Dwelling Houses All other Property Total Total number of properties in district 23,36'i (23,319) 4,659 (4,601) 28,025 (27,920) Number of properties inspected as a result of— (a) notifications 416 (354) 107 (103) 523 (457) (b) otherwise 169 (176) 48 (50) 217 (226) Number of properties found to be infested by rats— Major infestation (-) - (1) — (1) Minor infestation 224 (185) 49 (71) 273 (256) Number of properties found to be seriously infested by mice 164 (120) 31 (32) 195 (152) Number of infested properties treated by rodent operatives 388 (304) 76 (104) 464 (408) One notice was served which was complied with. Five (5) " block " control schemes were carried out. The sewers in the Borough received two treatments, in January and June. Trays were fixed at 150 points in the sewers. These trays are permanent fixtures introduced on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and are used for depositing thereon the pre-baits and poison baits. By this method the laying of baits is facilitated and moreover prevents the baits being washed away thereby destroying evidence as to whether they have been taken or not. These will be installed throughout the sewers next year and should be the means of saving time and labour in the future treatment of sewers. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951.—At the end of the year four (5) premises where filling material was being used were registered. There were no premises in the Borough where rag flock is manufactured or stored. Twelve samples were taken and all were satisfactory except one which failed to comply with the required standard of cleanliness to a minor extent. On the advice of the Analyst no action was taken beyond notifying the user and warning the wholesaler. SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS ACTS.—No licences to act as slaughtermen were applied for. One licence, granted in 1951, is still in force. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951.—This Act which came into operation on the 1st April, 1952 provides that no person shall keep a pet shop excepting under the authorization of a licence issued by the Council on payment of a fee of 10/- and subject to compliance with the conditions specified thereon. In addition the Act makes it an offence (i) for any person to carry on a business of selling animals as pets in any street or public place except at a stall or barrow in a market, (ii) to sell an animal as a pet to a person whom the Vendor has reasonable cause to believe to be under the age of 12 years. The Act authorizes inspection by the Council's officers and lays down penalties for offences and for wilful obstruction of officers in the exercise of their powers of entry or inspection. At the end of 1952 seven licences had been issued by the Council. 15 A decision that the giving of pets as prizes is not within the scope of the Act may lead to an unsatisfactory state of affairs on fairgrounds, a problem unlikely to occur in the borough. FOOD SUPERVISION. Byelaws for the Protection of Food.—These byelaws, made by the London County Council under section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, came into operation on the 3rd November, 1952. They concern the distribution of food in all its aspects—handling, wrapping, keeping and delivery—and considerably strengthen the forces fighting for clean food. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1952.—Clause 27 of this Act prohibits rag and bone dealers from giving or selling food or drink in connection with their business. Little trouble has been experienced in Paddington during recent years in this respect but the clause undoubtedly closes another loophole in the legislation. Powers are given now to eliminate this potential source of contaminated food. Unsound food.—Approximately 11 (16) tons of diseased or unsound food were surrendered for destruction. Legal proceedings were instituted for offences under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 against the owner of a bakehouse and a total of £12 in fines was imposed on four summonses. At a later hearing £10 in fines was imposed on five summonses brought against the same defendant. After consideration by the Public Health Committee warning letters were sent to the firms concerned in two cases where a fly and a splinter of wood were found in loaves of bread. Bacteriological examinations of milk and food.—Milk.—The number of samples submitted was 133 (170), all of which complied with the tests prescribed in the Milk Regulations. Ice cream.—Samples of ice cream, 39 (45) in number, examined for bacterial content as prescribed in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations gave the following results :— Grade 1 9 (14) Grade 3 7 (14) Grade 2 20 (8) Grade 4 3 (9) Ice "lollies —These cannot be graded because of the colouring matter in them, but 8 (8) were examined by other methods. Other samples.—Samples of condensed milk, cream pastries, sausages, chutney, pickles, cod roe paste, duck eggs and mussels were submitted. In no instance were any pathogens found. Food poisoning.—The following table gives a summary of the corrected cases of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning notified during the year :— Number of corrected cases 38 (69) Outbreaks due to identified agents.— Total outbreaks Nil (1) Total cases Nil (3) Outbreaks due to— Chemical poisons Nil (—) Salmonella organisms Nil (—) Staphylococci Nil (1) CI. botulinum Nil (—) Other bacteria Nil (—) Outbreaks of undiscovered cause— Total outbreaks 1 (—) Total cases 4 (—) Single cases— Agents identified 3 (5) Unknown cause 31 (61) Sampling.—Five hundred and fifty-one (600) samples were submitted to the Public Analyst. All the samples were reported on as genuine except the samples of baking powder which were deficient in available carbon dioxide. No action was considered necessary because these samples came from a small stock which had been in store for some time and after the Analyst's report was received none was sold. 16 Number Examined Number Adulterated Number Examined Number Adulterated Formal Informal Formal Informal Formal Informal Formal Informal Almonds, ground - 5 - - Ham, canned - 1 - - Aspirin tablets — 1 — — Honey — 2 — — Bacon — 6 — — Ice — 1 — — Baking powder 1 1 1 1 Icecream — 21 — — Beef, pressed — 1 — — Ice lollies — 13 — — Bicarbonate of soda — 2 — — Iodine — 5 — — Biscuits — 2 — — Jam — 2 — — Blancmange powder — 2 — — Jelly crystals — 1 — — Blauds pills — 1 — — Lard — 2 — — Boracic acid — 2 — — Lemon cheese — 1 — — Boracic powder — 1 — — Lemon juice — 1 — — Brawn — 3 — — Lemonade tablets ... — 1 — — Bread — 1 — — Liver sausage — 1 — — Butter — 9 — — Luncheon meat — 7 — — Cake — 3 — — Luncheon sausage ... — 1 — — Camphorated oil — 2 — — Macaroni — 1 — — Cashew, ground — 1 — — Margarine — 6 — — Castor oil 1 — — Meat pie — 4 — — Cheese — 12 — — Meat pudding — 1 — — Chicken, canned — 1 — — Milk 60 178 — — Chicken pie — 1 — — Milk, evaporated — 1 — Choc-ice ... — 1 — — Mincemeat ... — 2 Coconut, shredded — 1 — — Mincepie — 1 Cod liver oil — 3 — — Oil, frying — 1 — Coffee essence — 1 — — Ointment — 1 — Coffee extract — 3 — — Olive oil — 1 — Colouring — 1 — — Paraffin, liquid — 2 — Cordial — 1 — — Pastries, cream — 5 — Cottage pie, canned — 1 — — Peanut butter — 1 — Cough mixture — 4 — — Peel — 1 — Cracknels — 1 — — Pepper — 3 — Cream, synthetic — 3 — — Pepper compound — 1 — Curry powder — 2 — — Peppermint tablets — 1 — Custard powder — 1 — — Pickles — 3 — Egg farfals — 1 — — Pumpernickel — 1 — Egg mandels — 1 — — Rabbit, canned — 1 — Egg noodles — 1 — — Relish — 1 — Epsom salts — 3 — — Salmon — 1 — Eucalyptus oil — 1 — — Salt — 1 — Fat, cooking — 4 — — Sausage meat — 2 — Fish, bottled — 1 — — Sausage rolls — 1 — Fish, canned — 10 — — Sausages — 14 — Fish cakes — 1 — — Soup, chicken — 1 — Fish paste — 3 — — Spirit of nitre — 1 — Flavouring — 4 — — Suet, shredded — 3 — Flour — 3 — — Sugar — 10 — Frankfurter sausage — 2 — — Sulphur ointment — 2 — Fruit, bottled — 5 — — Sweets — 4 — Fruit, canned — 6 — — Tea — 6 — Fruit, dried — 4 — — Throat tablets — 2 — Fruit, glace — 2 — — Tonic — 2 — Gelatine — 1 — — Vaseline ... ... ... ...v — 1 — Ginger, crystalised — 2 — — Vegetables, canned — 5 — Ginger, stem — 1 — — Vegetables, dried — 1 — Glauber salts — 2 — — Vinegar — 2 — Glycerine — 2 — — Vitamin tablets — 1 — Glycerine of Thymol — 1 — — Water — 4 — Gravy powder — 1 — — Yoghourt — 1 — Halibut liver oil 2 — — Zinc ointment 3 Fond premises.—Following are details of the food premises in the Borough at the end of the year :— Food "Shops " :— Bakers 27 (27) Cake shops 16 (16) Butchers 59 (60) Horsemeat shops (human consumption) 2 (2) Confectioners 107 (110) Chemists 51 (48) Fishmongers 24 (24) Fried fish shops 19 (22) Grocers 36 (43) Provision stores 127 (110) Domestic stores 14 (16) Corn chandlers 2 (2) Greengrocers 91 (79) General shops 44 (46) Public Houses 98 (98) Cider Houses 2 (2) Off Licences 54 (54) Cafes, restaurants, etc. 143 (142) 17 Note.—There are 117 (115) shops registered for the sale of milk and 193 (170) premises registered for tl of ice-cream.

Further I would mention the continuous effort of the food inspectors to improve the standards of the public eating places and food shops. Their vigilance is unceasing and if the shopping public maintain their vigilance also, I am confident that cases of food poisoning from that source will be extremely rare. In many instances the shopkeeper is handicapped by the type of premises he occupies. In some cases the desire to make improvements is thwarted either by the prohibitive cost of the alterations desired or by the very structure of the premises restricting efforts in this direction. Every month the Public Health Committee have before them the report of the food inspectors on conditions found and action taken at food shops and restaurants chosen at random from their visits and inspections, and it is no exaggeration to say that with the co-operation and willingness of all persons concerned, steady progress is being made towards achieving the best conditions possible in establishments where food is prepared and handled. The London County Council bye-laws for the protection of food which came into force on the 3rd November it is hoped will materially assist the Council's efforts. SHOPS ACTS.—The Shops Acts Inspectors made 1,351 (1,500) visits. No statutory action was necessary, all contraventions found being dealt with informally. MASS RADIOGRAPHY.—The following information has been provided by the Organising Secretary of the Mass X-ray Unit No. 5B :— Mass radiography in Paddington during 1952 consisted of two separate types of survey. Early in the year the hospitals and chest clinic were suffering from a severe shortage of full-size x-ray film, and the Unit's help was sought to take as many of their x-rays as the medical authorities considered justified. As 18 a result of this the Unit visited Faddington between January and May, once in each month, for a total of twelve days. During these twelve days 3,122 persons were x-rayed, of whom 44 men and 65 women were recalled for a second Picture on a large film. The following table gives the results of these large films :— Referred to Tuberculosis Officer 34 No further action required 43 Recheck at a later date 17 Did not attend for large film 1 Awaiting result of investigation 14 By May, 1952 "Odelco" sets had been received by the hospitals and chest clinic and the work was transferred to these sets. The Unit had provided much needed assistance when it was required but the demand did not reach the estimated volume, as provision was made to x-ray a total of 6,600 persons under this scheme. Under the normal planning, the Unit visited the Maternity and Child Welfare Centre at 283, Harrow Road in December and provision was made to x-ray 4,925 persons. In fact 3,147 presented themselves and of this number 28 men and 20 women were recalled for large films to be taken. From these large films the following were obtained :— Male Female Total Intrathoracic new growth _ 1 1 Active primary lesions (without symptoms) 1 — 1 Active post primary unilateral (without symptoms) - 1 1 Active post primary unilateral (with symptoms) 2 _ 2 Active post primary bilateral (with symptoms) - 1 1 Inactive post primary lesions 1 2 3 Sarcoidosis — 1 1 Totals 4 6 10 The Council made a grant of £10 towards the cost of the publicity for the second survey. In addition, posters were exhibited and leaflets made available to the public at the Council's establishments. Booking centres, where appointments could be made, were opened at the Public Health Department and the Queen's Park Library. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE. —For some years there has been an Old People's Welfare Committee in Paddington. This Committee was however given a new impetus in January, 1952, when it was reconstituted at the suggestion of the Mayor at that time, Alderman Norris Kenyon, J.P., B.Sc., L.C.C. One of the first acts of the new committee was to appoint a paid part-time organiser for which purpose a grant was obtained from the Borough Council. Shortly afterwards a small fund was raised by the Committee for their general activities and already much good work has been done and several schemes are in hand for providing services to ease the burden of old age. HOLIDAY HOME. -The holidays at Bexhill continued to be so popular that many more people applied to go than could be accommodated. During the year 583 guests were accommodated at the Home. The figures for previous years are 1949 (the Home opened in April)—461 ; 1950—573 ; 1951—581. Staffing the Home continued to present difficulties. At one period in the summer there was neither a cook nor a domestic, leaving only the Manageress and the chambermaid-waitress. Thanks are due to the Manageress for her fine work in keeping the Home running smoothly and maintaining the high standard of comfort and enjoyment which the guests so frequently comment on. In accordance with the desire expressed by the Council on the 31st January, 1952, a suitably framed photograph of the late Alderman Mrs. Paterson was unveiled in the entrance hall of the Home on the 26th April, 1952. The inscription, which is in black lettering on a white mount underneath the photograph, reads as follows :— In memory of Alderman Mrs. M. M. Paterson, O.B.E., J.P., member of Paddington Metropolitan Borough Council from 1934 to 1951. Her untiring efforts on behalf of the aged led to the establishment of this Holiday Home. 19 The simple but impressive unveiling of the photograph was performed by His Worship the Mayor (Alderman Norris Kenyon, J.P., B.Sc., L.C.C.). He was supported by members of the Council, the Old People's Welfare Committee and Mrs. Paterson's family. This ceremony provided a fitting tribute to a lifetime spent in the interests of the people of Paddington. HOUSING.— Houses unfit for human habitation. No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 216 (234) No. of upper parts of premises dealt with by closing orders 2 (1) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted 4 (16) Forty-six (33) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations, sixteen (18) being rehoused by the Paddington Borough Council. Three (4) secured accommodation through their own efforts and twenty-seven (7) are awaiting suitable Council vacancies. Closing orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on six (7) basements and the upper parts of two (3) mews premises.

Twenty-two (38) notices under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936 were served during the year. Seven (7) were complied with and works were in progress at fourteen (15) other premises. In none (1) of these cases was default action found necessary. In one (15) case work had not commenced. Of the thirty-two (9) notices served prior to 1952 which remained outstanding, thirty have been complied with and in two (2) cases the work was carried out by the Council in default. At two other premises the required repairs were executed by the owners without formal action being taken. Housing Act, 1930—Overcrowding.

Some 87 of these were basement dwellings. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year, 29 (14) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 52 (85) were rehoused by the London County Council, 108 (135) secured accommodation privately, and 27 (35) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. The practice of sending warning letters to owners and landlords against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding of premises has been abated. Rehousing Inquiries. Some 900 communications were received during the year from the Borough Director of Housing, the County Divisional Medical Officer, the County Director of Housing and Valuer, and from other authorities requesting information on the housing condition of persons applying for re-housing on grounds of overcrowding, insanitary conditions, and ill-health. Such information enables the enquirer to assess the degree of priority to be given to the applicants concerned. In each case a visit was made by the Sanitary Inspector and a report furnished. Housing Accommodation : Preferential Treatment. Twelve (5) families recommended for preferential consideration in the allocation of accommodation on medical grounds were rehoused by the Borough Council, and seventeen (4) by the London County Council.
