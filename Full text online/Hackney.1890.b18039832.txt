To the Board of Works for the Hackney District Gentlemen,— In my Report for 1889 I brought to your notice some of the provisions of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, passed in that year, and I now have to mention especially three new Acts passed in 1890, abstracts of two of which will be found in the Appendix, viz., of the Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, which is supplemental to the Notification Act; and the Housing of the Working Classes Act, which repeals Torren's Act and substitutes an amended and simpler and cheaper procedure for it. It also extends the power of closing houses under the Nuisances Removal Acts, and provides payment to persons ordered to leave the premises if the Magistrates hearing the case should deem it advisable to make such an order. I have closed so many premises under the Nuisances Removal Acts, and obtained the removal of the inmates without compensation, that I do not see much, if any, advantage in the proceedings under the new Act for closing houses unfit for habitation. Another Act, viz., the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, quite unique as regards the 26th Clause, requires, on notice from the owner, the Medical Officer of Health to visit premises in which there are separate dwellings, the rental of which does not exceed 7s. 6d. per week, to enable him to obtain a remission of his taxes. The notice to inspect is not directed to the Local Authority, but to the Medical Officer of Health, and the certificate, if one be given, is not handed to them but to the person who is benefitted by the 6 remission, and that without any payment from him. This seems to me a most extraordinary parliamentary interference with my professional knowledge and time. The Infectious Diseases Notification Act has been useful in affording information as to numerous cases of infectious disease, which otherwise would not have come to my knowledge, so that the disinfection of the rooms of the sick, and where necessary of their clothing, has doubtless tended to prevent the spreading of these diseases. The increase of work owing to this Act has been very large, and it has been fairly met, but to a considerable extent at the expense of the regular inspection of the houses of the poorer classes. In 1888, the year before this Act came into operation, 5,410 of the houses were inspected ; but in 1890, 4,389 only were inspected, a falling off of about 20 per cent. The number of certificates received from the Medical Attendants of the sick was as follows:—For scarlet fever, 1,171; for small pox, 1; cholera, 0: diphtheria, 428; membranous croup, 38; erysipelas, 191; typhus, 2; enteric or typhoid fever, 201; and puerperal, 29, making the large total of 2,081 cases of infectious diseases certified in the year. This is not in excess of the number I expected when the Act was passed. The deaths from these diseases were as followsFrom scarlet fever, 55; diphtheria, 62; croup, 42 (this included all cases of croup); erysipelas, 15; typhus, 0; typhoid or enteric, 34; and puerperal, 13. The mortality from scarlet fever was not large, viz., 47 per cent. of the cases reported, whilst from enteric fever it reached 17 per cent, and from puerperal 47 per cent. A comparison between the number of certificates and of deaths will be a useful study in future years, as the death rate of infectious diseases varies to a great extent with the number and severity of the complications. On receipt of a certificate of scarlet fever a circular is sent to the parents, and as soon as the post-card is received back to the effect that the patient is no longer infectious, or on removal of the sick to a hospital, the rooms, clothing and bedding are disinfected by an officer of the Board. A similar circular is sent as regards diphtheria, and the premises disinfected at the proper time. On the back of the circular (re diphtheria) some instructions are given as to the sanitary management of the case. Copy of circular is appended. 7 DIPHTH E RI A. Infecfious Disease Notification Act, 1889. (52 and 53 Vict., c. 72). BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE HACKNEY DISTRICT. SANITARY DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, HACKNEY, 189 Sir, A Medical Certificate having been received here stating you have a case of Diphtheria in your house, I enclose a Post Card which you will please return to me, as soon as, in the opinion of your Medical Attendant, Disinfection of the premises should be done, but not before. If there are any children in the house they must be kept away from school until your Medical Attendant states they may be safely sent there. If any business or a school be carried on in the house, please let me know what it is, in which case the envelope may be marked private, or the enclosed Post Card may be used. Yours faithfully, JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D.. Medical Officer of Health for the To Hackney District. N.B.—Instructions to be observed during the course of a case of Diptheria to prevent the spread of the disease. The carpet should be taken up directly the disease is recognised. Pocket handkerchiefs should not be used for wiping the nose or mouth of the patient, but rags, which should be burnt. "If handkerchiefs are used, they should be thrown immediately after use into boiling water, or into carbolic acid water and afterwards boiled. All expectoration not wiped away, should be spat into a vessel (spitting pot) containing a small quantity of carbolic acid and water. Everything taken away from the room should be put into boiling water immediately. Sheets, &c., and all articles of clothing worn during the illness should be washed with carbolic soap and boiled at home. After recovery and disinfection, the walls should be well wiped down, the paint work and floor scrubbed twice with carbolic soap or soft soap and water, and the window afterwards kept open for as long as convenient. JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D. 8 As regards the spread of diphtheria, the source of infection could rarely be ascertained. There has not been any outbreaks this year connected with schools, although occasionally I have had some suspicion that the disease may have been contracted in the playground. There has not been any unusual prevalence amongst the pupils in any school classes, and I must say that with the exception of scarlet fever, there has been but little evidence in this district of infectious disease being contracted in the school rooms. Sanitary defects have sometimes been found in the houses, but more often not, so that I cannot ascribe the attacks to this cause, although sore throats are very frequently met with in badly drained premises. I believe, however, that the course and severity of the disease are considerably modified by the sanitary surroundings. The connection between sore throats and diphtheria is doubtful, as although the former usually begins and ends without diphtheritic exudation taking place during the inflammatory stage, and without paralysis after an attack, yet occasionally I have known diphtheria to occur in the course of what has seemed to be an attack of ordinary inflamed throat. The development of diphtheria seems to be caused by some condition of the patient, which renders the recipient more susceptible than usual to the diphtheritic poison, as for instance, an inflamed membrane is more liable to receive infection than a healthy one. In my last report I alluded to a connection between diphtheria in cats and adults, and the researches of Koch seem to prove the validity of my belief that children might give the disease to cats, and also that cats might infect human beings. Influenza.—Considering the large number of persons attacked with this disease the mortality was small, but a considerable number suffered for a considerable time from great languor and debility. I have not any means of judging as to the numbers attacked, but they must have amounted in this district alone, to thousands. The total deaths were only 31, of which 3 occurred between 1 and 5 years of age, 2 between 5 and 15, and also between 15 and 25. The number then rose to 6 among the persons aged between 25 and 35, 3 between 35 and 45, 2 9 between 45 and 55, 5 between 55 and 65, as many as 7 between 65 and 75, and 1 above 75 years of age. These figures show the inability of the aged to resist the disease, as compared with the young, and females also were attacked, or certainly succumbed to a greater extent than males, viz., 24 of the former to 7 of the latter. Statistics.—The population on July 1, 1890, as shown in Table 1, was calculated at 248,619 persons, which is a smaller number than would have been given, if the same rate of increase had been continued for this decade as for 1871-81. The statistics of assessments lately issued by the Trustee Board show that the increase during the last 5 years in the number of inhabited houses has not been nearly equal to that in 1881-86, so that I have made my calculations accordingly. The census to be soon published will show the correctness, or the contrary, of the number assigned above. The number of births registered was only 6,730, although it included the returns for 53 weeks. In 1889 the number was 6,674 in 52 weeks. The table shows that the number has fallen off since 1887, although the population has increased, but the same remark applies to all London. The corrected number of deaths was considerably larger than for 1889, having been 4,070 against 3,352. This increase occurred chiefly in January, February, and December, when the mortality from inflammatory diseases of the lungs was very large. This will be referred to again in connection with the meteorology of the year. The deaths under 1 year amounted to 902 against 715 in 1889, and against 851 for the 10 years 1880-89. The number of persons to an acre has increased from 46 2 in 1880 to 63 2 in 1890, so that an increased death-rate from this cause only might have been expected. 10 TABLE I.

The birth-rate per 1000 population was only 27.4 against 27.7 in 1889, and 31.2 in 1880-89. The special diseases to which the increased death-rate is attributable will be shown in the discussion of Table III. The annual deathrate for all London in the ten years, 1880-9, was 20.0 against 17.5 in 1889 and in 1890, so that the figures for Hackney correspond favourably with those for all London, at the same time it is not satisfactory that so great a rise has taken place this year as compared with 1889. At the same time I may call to your recollections that I pointed out the very small number of deaths from infectious diseases in 1889, which was much, below the average, and which was greater in 1890. The birth-rate still continues to fall in Hackney and all London, which partly accounts for the low death-rates, as so large a proportion of infants, when compared with the total population, die during the first year of life. It is very probable that the Census may show a larger percentage of persons living between five and fortyfive than formerly, and if so, this would partly account for the diminished death-rates which have obtained for some years past. The deaths of infants under one year, per 1000 registered births, was low in 1890, having been 132 against 163 for all London. At the same time this is a higher rate in this district than in 1888 and 1889, when it was only 125 and 107 respectively. This increase will require carefully watching, as the mortality of the newly-born is considered to be the great test of good sanitary arrangements, as infants pass so much of their lives in-doors. The proportion of total deaths under one year of age, to total deaths at all ages, was more favourable, as there were only 221 per 1000 deaths, against 238 in 1880-81, but it was above that for 1889, when only 213 occurred. In 1871-80 the calculation was not so favourable, as the rate Was 247 against 221 in 1890. B 2 12 TABLE II.

The corrected death rate which is ordinarily 2 8 per 1,000 in Hackney below that for London was this year nearly 4 per 1,000 below it, which is very satisfactory, especially as the difference is greater than in 1889. The same remark applies to the deaths of children under 1 year old. In an article published in the British Medical Journal, headed the True Death-rates of London Sanitary Districts during 1890, will be found a summary of the figures actually 13 belonging to the respective sanitary districts. These are the result of a complete distribution of deaths occurring in the public institutions of London among the various sanitary districts in which the patients had previously resided. The lowest death-rates were as follows: In Lewisham, 14.7 per 1000 inhabitants; in Kensington, 14-8; in Hampstead, 14.9; in St. George's, Hanover Square, 15.0; in Camberwell, 15.8; in Battersea, 16.3; in Hackney, 16.4; in Plumstead, 16.7; in Islington, 17.8. In this list for 1890, Hackney is 7th, instead of being as last year 4th. The highest death-rates include London City, 22.3; Whitechapel, 22.9; St. Giles' and Stepney, 231 ; St. Saviour, Southwark and Fulham, 23.3; St. George's, Southwark, 23.6; Holborn, 25.5; and St. George's in the East, 26.5. As regards deaths from infectious diseases, Hackney was 5th on the list, and of the number of deaths of children under one year to each 1000 children born, Hackney was 3rd with 143, Plumstead being first with 129, some of the districts (parishes) giving very high numbers, viz., 181 for St. George's, East; 183 for St. James', Westminster; and 199 for the Strand District. As compared with the Public Health Statistics of the large English towns, Hackney occupies a very favourable position, as not one of the twenty-eight English towns in 1890 was returned in the same journal as having so low a rate. The lowest was Nottingham with 16.5; Brighton, 17.8; Leicester, 17.9; and Derby with 18.5 per 1000 population. As regards the mortality amongst new-born children, the only one of the twenty-eight towns below Hackney was Portsmouth with 135. In Brighton it was 164, against 132 in Hackney. By Table III. we learn that the increase in the number of deaths and of the death-rate arises chiefly from the prevalence and fatality of the zymotic (infectious) class of diseases, as there were 2.75 deaths per 1000 population, against only 1.63 in 1889, and 2.26 in 1888. The mortality from inflammatory diseases of the air passages was 3.29 per 1000, against 2.60 in 1889; indeed there was an excess in the death-rates of all these groups of diseases in 1890 as compared with 1889, except convulsive 14 diseases of children. The total number of deaths per 1000 population from these five groups of diseases was 9.83 in 1890; 7.76 in 1889; 9.13 in 1888; 9.78 in 1887; and 10.45 in 1886, so that we have to go back to 1886, when deaths from tubercular diseases were so prevalent, for so high a rate as in 1890.

In 1884 as many as 210 deaths of parishioners were registered in this district, and 86 in 1885, so that the absence of this disease in an epidemic form is a subject for congratulation. Measles, however, has proved very fatal, as in 1890 no less than 149 deaths were registered from this disease, the average for the 10 years being 95. The mortality occurred chiefly in the first three and the last two months of the year, when the cold weather prevailed. Scarlet fever, although it has been to a certain extent epidemic this year, has not caused even the average mortality, as there were only 55 deaths against a mean for 10 years of 73. The disease was not attended with the severe complications often observed, nor were there many of the very fatal form known as "malignant scarlet fever" in which death takes place frequently in a day or two. Diphtheria, on the contrary, has been decidedly prevalent all over the district, without the local outbreaks which occasionally occur. The number of deaths in 1890 was 62, against 93 in 1889, and an average for 10 years of 4.4. I have already referred to the comparative rarity with which the origin of the disease can be traced, either to personal intercourse or local causes. Whooping cough was also very prevalent and fatal, from the same causes as measles, viz., cold, damp weather. The unusual number of 182 deaths were registered in 1890, against a decennial average of 115, and it has not caused so great a mortality in any one year during the 11 years included in the table. There was not any death from typhus. The mortality from typhoid or enteric fever was much smaller than the average, 48, but was slightly in excess of the number for 1888 and 1889. A rather considerable number of cases occurred amongst residents on their return from Margate> Southend and Yarmouth. Diarrhœa also did not' cause so many deaths as usual, as there were only 110 against the average of 133 in 10 years, 93 in 1889, and only 78 in 1888. The mortality from diarrhoea depends chiefly on the mean temperature of July and August; when this is high, and the earth and water becomes heated to 65° F. or above, then diarrhoea is both prevalent and fatal. 17 TABLE V.

We see that a much smaller proportion of deaths under 1 year has occurred in the last 3 years as compared with most of the former years included in this table, a proportion nearly approaching that for the 10 years 1856.65, 18 when the district was much less crowded, and the proportion of middle-class to the poorer inhabitants was much larger than now. But the smaller proportion (22.2 per cent.) under 1 year was counter-balanced to a certain extent by the increased rate for 1-5 years of age. The increase at this age period was caused by the great excess of deaths from measles and whooping cough, as the greatest number of deaths from these diseases happened at this age period. At 5-15 and 15-25, especially the latter, the death-rate was unusually small, only 4.8 and 3.5 per cent. of all the deaths having then occurred. The deaths at other ages do not require any special mention, except the large proportion of persons whose deaths were registered above 85 years of age. There were 23 deaths between 85 and 86; 10 between 86 and 87; 14 between 88 and 89, making 57 deaths of persons who were above 85 but under 90 years of age. The number of deaths above 90 years was also unusually large, viz., 26, many of which occurred during the frost at the end of the year. There were 10 between 90 and 91; 4 between 91 and 92; 3 between 92 and 93; 2 between 93 and 94; 1 at each age between 94 and 95, and 95 and 96. At 99 years of age and under 100, 4 deaths were registered, and 1 at the patriarchal age of 100. This person was a Jew, who died in the Hand-in-Hand Asylum, in Well street. 19 TABLE VI.

The per centages to total births were 11.3 in Stoke Newington, against 12'2 in 1881 (the census year); 6.3 in Stamford Hill to 5.2 in 1881; 18.4 in West Hackney against 20.2 in 1881; 44.0 in Hackney against 40.8 in 1881; and 20.0 in South Hackney against 21.6 in 1881. The total number of births registered in the district during the 53 weeks was 6,730, of which 762 were registered in Stoke Newington; 420 in Stamford Hill, 1,240 in West Hackney; 2,963 in Hackney (Sub.Division), and 1,345 in South Hackney. 20 TABLE VII.

As many of the addresses of persons dying outside the district are not given in the returns, and also of many persons dying in the Infirmary and in the River Lee, the deaths cannot be fairly distributed amongst the other sub-districts. It is true that the population of these institutions are included in the population of the Hackney sub-district, and therefore would to a certain extent counterbalance the percentages of deaths above worked out. As the number of deaths was so much larger for the whole district, it was to be expected there would also be an increase in each sub-division. As will be seen this is the case, as the excess over 1889 in Stoke Newington was 85; in Stamford Hill 63; in West Hackney 105; in Hackney 349; and in South Hackney 116. 21 Disinfection.—In consequence of the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Notification and Prevention Acts, chiefly of the former, the number of articles disinfected was much larger than in 1889, the total being 2,431 against 1,058 in 1889, and of houses disinfected 769 against 299. There were several rooms disinfected in one house on many occasions, so that this does not represent the entire work done. The number of beds disinfected amounted to 380 against 120 in 1889, as will be seen in the table. In all instances where beds, &c., are taken to the disinfecting chamber, a superficial disinfection by sulphur is previously made to prevent risk of infection to any person who might come near the articles during their removal to the track. In some cases the disinfection was done under the personal supervision of the patient's medical attendant, who, in all such cases, sent me a certificate of efficiency. TABLE VIII.

The Coroner ordered the removal of 168 bodies for the purpose of holding inquests, and of these 88 were taken back after the inquests were over, 60 were retained because there was not proper accommodation in the premises from which the bodies were removed, and 20 were kept until the burial at the request of 22 relatives. In addition to this, six bodies were removed by my order, as the dead were kept in a living room, and nine still-borns were brought in. Twenty post mortems were made there, instead of being done in private houses, most of which were unsuitable for the purpose. The number of deaths from violence was not very large, viz., 8 from drowning, 11 from accidents, 3 from poison, and 9 were suicides, making a total of 31. Underground Dwellings.—The District Surveyors, under the Metropolis Local Management Act, have reported as usual that there are no underground dwellings which come under the provisions of this Act, but there are several which are used as kitchens or sculleries, or even sitting-rooms, which do not come under the provisions of these Acts, but which are visited by the Inspectors of Nuisances, and occasionally by myself, and I object to these rooms being used even for these purposes, as they are often dark and the ventilation indifferent, but cannot close them, as they are not used for sleeping rooms. Dust Removal.—Year by year the cost of removing the dust becomes larger, partly in consequence of the increase in the number of houses, and partly by the increased price paid per load. The prices of the present contract, 1890, are 2s. 9d. per load of 60 cubic feet for the A Division, viz., Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, upper and part of lower Clapton; 2s. 2½d. for the B Division, which includes the Clapton Park Estate, Homerton and South Hackney; and 2s. 9d. per load for the C Division, which includes Shacklewell, Dalston and De Beauvoir Town. Although the amount is large compared with that formerly paid, yet it is smaller than the sum paid by some Metropolitan Parishes for barging the dust away after it has been collected. The total number of loads of dust removed from the A Division was 12,180, from the B Division 11,924, and from the C Division 12,071, making a total of 36,175 loads, against 33,881 in 1889. The number removed this year was less than it would have been if the ground had not been covered with snow during part of November and the whole of December, so that persons would not have the dust removed except when it was urgently required. The total amount paid to the Contractor was £4,650 19s. 9d.; 23 to the dustmen and two persons engaged in checking the loads, £756 5s. 1d.; and to the Dust Superintendent, £109 4s.; making a total of £5,516 8s. 10d., against £5,203 5s. 10d. in 1889. The number of requests to remove dust was 1,340, but this was much below the number in many other parishes. Cow-sheds and Slaughter-houses.—The number of both is diminishing every year as new licences are rarely granted, and several of the old ones are refused annually. In 1890 six renewals of licences for cow-sheds were entirely refused, viz., to Mr. Whitby, 12, Bay St., Dalston; Mr. Strong, Lee Bridge, Clapton; Messrs. J. & G. Abbott, 3, Paradise Place; Richards, 174, Culford Boad; Jones, Dynevor Boad; Crane, 17, Hertford Boad, and three as regards one shed at each place, viz., Briggs, 65, Pritchard Row; Welford, Spring Hill, Clapton; and Lillicrap, 167, Well Street. The renewal of a slaughter-house licence was refused at Plough Lane, and an application to newly-establish a slaughterhouse at Stamford Hill was also refused. The places licensed were clean and in good condition when licensed, but several were in a defective state when visited by the Committee and myself, shewing the necessity for continued oversight. An application for an extension of the shed at 3, Hill Street was made by Mr. Snewin, and not granted, as it would have been brought too near the houses, and have interfered with the free ventilation of adjoining premises. Sanitary Work.—With the exception of the inspection of small houses occupied by the working and poorer classes, which was smaller than usual, the sanitary work has been carried on to nearly the same extent as in former years, and the number of nuisances discovered, chiefly on inspection, has been proportionately about an average. The number of choked and defective drains which were cleansed, repaired, or reconstructed were 716, being fewer than in 1889, and the same remark applies to broken or choked water-closet pans, which shews that the poorer classes in this district are becoming more careful in their use. The number of new traps provided, viz., 497, instead of bell traps was large, although not so numerous as in former years. Nearly all these were found in houses visited on complaint, and not in the course of the ordinary inspection. The number of sink wastes 24 and rain-water pipes directly connected with the drains is also diminishing every year, and these also were chiefly met with on premises visited on complaint. The total number of nuisances abated in 1890, arising from defective drainage, was 1,758. The paving of many of the yards was very defective so that it was necessary to have it relaid or repaired on 552 premises. The defective state chiefly arose from the tenants chopping wood or otherwise improperly using the paving, and a similar remark applies to dustbins, but to a greater extent, as new bins, or large pails were provided at 918 houses. Whitewashing and cleansing of houses were not required in so many instances as usual, viz., 1,738 against 2,132 in 1889, in consequence of the diminished number of inspections of small houses, the same remark applies to leaky roofs, viz., 448 in 1890, against 561 in 1889. The defects in the water supply apparatus to water-closets numbered 926 in 1890, against 1,027 in 1889. These figures show, I think, the necessity for regular inspection of small property as the percentage of nuisances varies but little every year, and consequently the omission of an inspection would, unless complaints were made here, entail the existence of these nuisances in poor houses for a comparatively indefinite time. In addition to these, 183 notices were served on houses where the water had been cut off, for defective fittings, requiring the owner to have it laid on again and with successful results. In connection with the sanitary work I have to mention with very much regret the sudden death of Mr. Edwin Sortwell. He was an active, energetic, willing and painstaking man, who carried out his duties to my satisfaction, so that I have missed him considerably in the sanitary work. His brother, Mr. W. Sortwell, has also been ill twice during the year, as certified by his medical attendant, from excess of work; and Mr. Punter also has been absent from the same cause. In connection with the sanitary work, I would mention that 12 houses have been closed at Lea Bridge, and subsequently pulled down without expense to the district, also 6 houses at Abney Gardens. Several houses have also been closed owing to the non-abatement of nuisances existing therein, but were reopened when the necessary work was done. The action was taken in all instances under the Nuisances Eemoval Acts. 25 Accumulations of manure and house refuse have given a good deal of trouble in connection with the wharves at Hertford Road, and necessitated several visits by me, and numerous visits by the inspectors. Notices were served on the occupiers to remove the accumulations, which was done, but fresh deposits were made, and on a summons being taken out, requiring not only the removal, but the cessation of the deposits, the magistrate only ordered the removal, and refused an order "to cease to deposit." A great nuisance also arose from the burning of soft core, i.e., vegetable refuse separated from the dust, in an improperly constructed " destructor," but this was abated by the old destructor being pulled down, and a new one built on the wharf, where the chief nuisance arose. As regards the other wharf, more care was used in destroying the refuse, so that I have not lately had any complaints. Accumulations of various kinds in private backways, mews, and other similar places, have also taken up much time in obtaining their removal, for in some instances, as many as 15 to 20 notices were served on those having the "user" of the places. Complaints respecting many of these were in some instances frivolous, as they applied to paper, old tins, &c., which were neither dangerous nor injurious to health. Large deposits of road sweepings, removed from roads in this district, and made either in holes or on private ground, have led to several complaints from adjoining owners of property, but although very unsightly, I have not been able to show that they were injurious to health, unless mixed with a considerable proportion of vegetable refuse, when I have called upon the persons depositing to take them away. Deposits of various kinds are the more annoying, as owing to the size of the district it is impossible to make special inspections without occupying more time than the limited staff at my disposal would allow. The alterations effected in the boot trade, by which persons now work to a great extent in workshops instead of at home, has led to much extra inspection, as warehouses and other places not built for factories have been used, and many visits were consequently made to them by myself and the Chief Inspector. The water closet accommodation was generally 26 insufficient and bad, and the same remark applies to the means of ventilation. The necessary alterations were made in all the premises we visited. River Lee.—In consequence partly of the wet weather in March and April and the unusual cold in April, the condition of the River Lee was fairly good, until May, when it became more opaque and had a slight urinous smell. In May the Tottenham effluent was very offensive and opaque, and I reported to that effect to the Sanitary Committee as well as to the Board. Subsequently, in my report, dated October 14th, I stated "that the water of the Eiver Lee had very much deteriorated since the effluent was poured into it on October 1st, as it is now dark-coloured, opaque, has a strong urinous smell, and contains a large excess of chlorine, of free and saline ammonia, as well as of soluble organic matter, as compared with September before the effluent was run in." The river continued to be in a very unsatisfactory state during the greater part of November so that an arrangement with the London County Council to receive the Tottenham and Wood Green drainage permanently will be most satisfactory, and enable the river to be again used all the year round for the purposes of recreation. Meteorology.—The weather, taking the year as a whole, has been characterised by an unusual prevalence of cold after January, less rain, with frequent but not heavy falls. In eight months the temperature was below the mean, and in December to the extent of 10 deg., whilst in four only it was above the mean. In January on one day the temperature was more than 13 deg. above the mean, and on several days more than 10 deg., so that with one exception it was the warmest January since 1846. The highest temperature recorded was 55.8 deg., the lowest 27'6 and the rainfall 2.22 inches, which fell on 27 days. February was cold and generally dry, as rain fell on 8 days only. The highest temperature was 49.8 deg., and the lowest 28.2 deg.; the mean temperature for the month was 37.5 deg., or 1.9 deg. below the average of 49 years. March was very cold at first, but a high temperature, 68.8 deg., was reached on one day, whilst it was as low as 19.4 deg. on another, affording the large range of 49.4 deg. The mean temperature was 43.2 deg., or 27 0.2 deg. below that for January. In April there was an unusual prevalence of cold e. and n.e. winds, so that the mean temperature was below the average, except on a few days. Rain fell on 13 days. The highest temperature recorded was 65.0 deg., and the lowest 32.5 deg., so that there was no extreme cold in the month. Eain fell on 17 days to the extent of 1.58 inches. Some days of May were very warm, the high maximum temperature of 77.8 deg. having been attained, but the lowest was only 41.2 deg., the cold on several days having been caused by the e. winds, but the mean temperature was 2.2 deg. in excess. The range was large, viz., 36 6 deg., and rain fell on 12 days to the extent of 1.42 inches. June was cold and wet, the temperature of the air being below the mean nearly every day; rain fell on 16 days to the extent of 2.51 inches. The highest temperature recorded was 77.6 deg., and the lowest 42.8 deg., giving a range of 34.8 deg. Similar weather prevailed in July, which was cold, wet and dull, rain having fallen on 16 days to the extent of 3.31 inches. The highest temperature recorded was 76.8 deg., being below that in May and June, whilst the lowest was 47.4 deg. On several days the mean temperature was more than 10 deg. below the average. August again was cold and wet, with but little sun; yet the highest temperature recorded was 81.4 deg., and on several other days a high temperature prevailed. The mean was only 59.3 deg. or 2.7 below the average of 49 years. A very pleasant change occurred in September, which as a whole was very fine, warm, and dry, as rain fell on 7 days only to the extent of 0.57 inches. The highest temperature was 78.0 deg., and the lowest 45.6, the mean being 59.5 deg., or 2.5 deg. above the average. October also was fine and dry until nearly the end, when severe cold prevailed, the low temperature of 26.8 deg. having occurred. The highest was 69.6, so that there was the large range of 42.8 deg., and the mean temperature was 49.3 deg., which was 0.5 below the average. In the early part and middle of November the weather was mild and fine, but on the 24th one of the longest frosts of modern times set in, having continued with one or two short breaks until January 12th, and prevailed all over Europe. Very low temperatures did not occur except on one or 28 two days during the whole period, the lowest in November having been 29.6 deg., whilst the highest was 59.0 deg. There was a rather considerable amount of rain, viz., 1.48 inches, which fell on 19 days. The mean temperature was 0.3 above the average In December I registered the low temperature of 11.8 deg. in Hackney, but this was not nearly so low as in some other places in England. The highest temperature recorded was 43.8, and the mean only 29.8, being 10.0 deg., below the average. Snow fell on 11 days, and remained unmelted except for two days during the month. It was the coldest month since January, 1838. TABLE. Hackney Table of Temperature and Rainfall for 1890. Months. Absolute Temperature. Range. Mean Temperature. Difference from mean of 9 years.

H. Bailey, J. B. Cohen, Mr. Hartog (of Owen's College), and Dr. Tatham, who have reported thereon. The report shows a great increase in the number of deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs during the prevalence of the fogs which were impregnated with sulphurous acid, tar acids, and other injurious matter. Taking the normal number of deaths per week in Manchester from the above named causes at 60, they found that during the exceptionally dense fogs which preceeded Christmas, this number went up to more than 200. In London, the number of deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs which previously to the fogs were only 300 rose during and immediately following the fogs to 927 in the week ending January 3rd, 1891. These fogs were accompanied by a long continuance of cold weather, so that the whole of the increased number of deaths must not be entirely attributed to them. The sulphurous acid of the air arises wholly and solely from the combustion of coal, which ordinarily contains from 1 to 2 per cent of sulphur. During three day's fog, the experiments showed that in the vicinity of the Infirmary there was carried down per square mile nearly 6 cwt. of sulphuric acid, while at Owen's College the amount was over 4 cwt. The "blacks" amounted to over 2 tons, and the hydrochloric acid to above 2 cwt. per square mile. Experiments on the air of London during fogs, made some years ago, showed that nearly the same amount of acids, and a large quantity of tar products were contained in the air. It is therefore advisable that every one who can should keep indoors during foggy weather. The number of fogs observed during the winter of 1890-91 was nearly double the average.

Sect. 4, provides that if the Medical Officer of Health has evidence of an outbreak of disease from the supply of infected milk to persons resident in the district, he shall on a Magistrates order, visit the dairy in company with a veterinary surgeon, and if satisfied that the outbreak has arisen from the milk, shall report the same to the Board, who may thereupon give notice to the dairyman to appear before them to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him to discontinue the sale of such milk. Notice of the order when made is to be served on the milkman, and notice is also to be given to the London County Council and Local Government Board. The penalty for continuing to supply the milk, is not more than £5 and 40/- a day. Sect. 5, sub-sections 1 and 2, enact that when the Medical Officer of Health, or any other registered medical practitioner certifies that the cleansing and disinfection of any house or part thereof, and of infected articles contained therein, would tend to prevent the check of infectious 2 disease a notice shall be served on the owner or occupier to cleanse and disinfect the said premises and articles. If he should neglect to notify to the Board within 24 hours that he will obey the notice, it becomes the duty of the Board to do the work and charge the cost to the owner or occupier and recover the same in a summary manner. By sub-section 3, if the Board or their Medical Officer of Health is of opinion that the owner or occupier is unable to carry out the work, it may be done at the cost of the Board by their Officers. By Sect. 6, the Board, or the Medical Officer of Health generally empowered by them in that behalf, may require the owner of any bedding, clothing, and other articles which have been exposed to infection, to cause them to be delivered to an Officer of the Board, for the purpose of disinfection, under a penalty of £10. The articles shall be removed and disinfected by the Board, and brought back free of charge, and if they have suffered unnecessary damage, the Board shall compensate the owner, and the amount shall be recoverable in a court of summary jurisdiction. By Sect. 7, every person who shall cease to occupy any house or part thereof in which any person has within 6 weeks been suffering from any infectious disease, without having the house or part thereof, and the articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfaction of a registered medical practitioner, as testified by a certificate signed by him, or without giving notice to the owner of the house, of the existence of such disease, or who makes a false statement in reply to questions by the owner or persons negotiating for the hire of the house or part thereof, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10. Sect. 8, prohibits the retention of the body of any person who has died of an infectious disease, for longer than 48 hours, except in a mortuary, or in a room not used for any other purpose than the retention of the body. Sect. 9, enacts that if a person shall die from an infectious disease in a hospital, and the Medical Officer of Health or any other registered medical practitioner, certifies that the body shall not be removed, 3 except for immediate burial or for deposit in a mortuary, the person removing it shall be subject to a penalty not exceeding £10. By Sect. 10, if the body of a person who has died from an infectious disease, be retained for longer than 48 hours, except as aforesaid, or in such a manner as to endanger the health of the inmates of the house, a/ny justice may, on the application of the Medical Officer of Health, order the body to be removed at the cost of the Board to the mortuary, and be buried within the time limited in the order, or may order immediate burial. If the friends of the deceased do not bury the body within the time mentioned in the order, it shall be the duty of the relieving officer to bury it, and the Guardians may recover the cost from any person legally bound to pay the amount. By Sect. 11, any person hiring a public conveyance other than a hearse for the conveyance of the body of a person who has died from an infectious disease without notifying to the driver the cause of death shall be guilty of an offence under the Act. The same penalty, £5, applies to the driver if he should not immediately provide for the disinfecting of the vehicle. It will not be necessary to carry out the provisions of Sect. 12, in this District, as patients are kept in the Asylums' Board Hospitals, until they cease to be infectious. Under the provisions of Sects. 13 and 14, it will be necessary to send a notice respecting Sections 7 and 13, to the occupier of every house in which an infectious disease occurs, as under Sect. 13, a penalty not exceeding £5. is payable by "any person who shall knowingly cast, or cause or permit to be cast, into any ash-pit, ash-tub, or other receptacle for the deposit of refuse matter, any infectious rubbish without previous disinfection." Also bccause any breach of Sect. 7, will entail a similar penalty. Sect. 15, provides that " the Board shall provide from time to time, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation with any necessary attendants, for the members of any family in which any infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their 4 dwelling for the purpose of enabling such dwelling to be disinfected by the Board." Sects. 10 to 19 inclusive, apply to the amount and recovery of penalties and power of entry for the purposes of Sect 5. Sect. 17, provides that the officer appointed by the Board, shall when required, produce his authority to enter the premises between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Sect. 20, authorizes the expenses of carrying out the provisions of this Act being defrayed as part of the expenses of the Board in the execution of the Acts relating to public health. The other Sections do not refer to this Board, ABSTRACT prepared by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH on The Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, By request of the Sanitary Committee of the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Part 1 deals with unhealthy areas of sufficient size to bring them under the control of the London County Council, and therefore does not apply to this Board. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION. Part 2 repeals Torrens' Act and enables the Board to undertake the closing of premises unlit for human habitation under the powers conferred upon them by certain sections of the Nuisances Removal and Sanitary Acts, and of closing them under the provisions of this Act. Action is to be taken under this Part, when the unhealthy area is too small to be dealt with under Pari 1. The procedure is as follows—The Medical Officer of Health is required, under clause 81, to report to the Board any dwelling house which is unfit for human habitation, either on the complaint of four householders living near the said houses, or from his own knowledge acquired in the ordinary course of his duty. If the Board should not take action on the report, the Local Government Board may hold an enquiry, and may order the Board to take 2 the necessary proceedings. Under clause 82 the Board is required to take action before a Magistrate, on the Medical Officer's report, for the purpose of causing the said dwelling house to be closed. The Magistrate may impose a penalty not exceeding £20 on the owner, who, however, may appeal against the order for closure or the payment of a penalty. When the order is made and not appealed against, seven days' notice has to be served on the occupiers, requiring them to leave the premises, under a penalty not exceeding 20s. a day for default; but the Magistrate may award a reasonable allowance to the occupiers which must be paid by the Board, and afterwards recovered from the owner as a civil debt. By clause 88, if the order has not been carried out in a reasonable time, and if the Board should be of opinion that the continuance of the dwelling house is dangerous to health, they may pass a resolution ordering it to be demolished, and serve at least a month's notice on the owner, specifying the time and place appointed for the consideration of such notice, to enable him to state his objections to the demolition. If the Board then resolve that the house should be demolished, and the owner should neglect to render the house fit for human habitation, the Board can order the demolition. If the owner undertakes to execute the works, but does not do so within the time specified in the order, the Board is required to order the demolition. By section 84, if the order for demolition be not carried out within three months after the service of the order, the Board may pull it down and sell the material, paying to the owner any balance after payment of expenses. By clause 35, any person aggrieved by the order may appeal to Quarter Sessions, and no work shall be done until the appeal is determined or ceases to be prosecuted. Notice of appeal must be given within one month after the order. If, however, the Board should require works to be done, the owner may apply for a charging order for the costs of the works, to be defrayed as an annuity out of the rent. The annuity is chargeable for 80 years at the rate of six per cent, on the amount spent. The charge so made may be assigned as a rentcharge, and shall have priority over all other charges except quit rent, tithes, &c. Charging orders in Middlesex are to be registered. 3 OBSTRUCTIVE BUILDING. The Medical Officer of Health may represent that any building which conduces to make another building or buildings unfit for human habitation should be pulled down; the Board shall thereupon cause a report to be made to them of the circumstances, and after considering the same may order copies thereof to be given to the owner who may appeal in the manner provided by the Act. If the appeal be not successful or be abandoned, the Board may purchase the land and pull down the building. All questions as to the value of the land are to be decided by an arbitrator. SCHEME FOR RE-CONSTRUCTION. Where a house has been pulled down, or where it appears to the Board that the closeness, narrowness and bad arrangement or condition of any of the buildings is prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, and that the demolition or re-construction thereof is necessary, and that the site is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy area under Part 1, the Board shall pass a resolution to that effect, and direct a scheme to be prepared for the improvement of the area. Notices have then to be served in accordance with Part 1, and a petition presented to the Local Government Board, for an order sanctioning the scheme, which may be made after a local inquiry. The Board may then purchase the area comprised in the scheme; but the owners may, within two months after the publication of the order, petition the Local Government Board against it. If the petition be not pressed, the Local Government Board shall confirm the order, which will then have the same effect as if enacted by Act of Parliament. SETTLEMENT OF COMPENSATION. This is to be settled by an Arbitrator, who shall receive evidence as to the value of the property, and shall take into consideration the amount necessary to put the house into a good sanitary condition, and deduct the same from the value of the house. There are numerous provisions regarding these sections which need not now be dealt upon. 4 POWERS OF LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL, &c. By Section 45, the Board must forward to the London County Council all particulars relative to the action taken under this Act. Where the London County Council are of opinion that a Vestry or Board should have made a scheme and have neglected to do so, they may prepare such scheme, and obtain its confirmation, and carry out such scheme, and charge the cost of same to the Vestry or Board, or may contribute thereto, if they see fit, part of the expenses. An appeal to the Secretary of State may be made as regards the expenditure. Under Section 46, the amount expended may be borrowed, and the repayment spread over several years, and the London County Council may defray part thereof, By Section 47, certain powers are granted to superior landlords as regards owners for the time being. Under Section 72, when an official representation is made to the London County Council in pursuance of Part 1, they shall not take proceedings if it relate to not more than ten houses, but remit it to the Board to carry out. If the number be greater than ten houses, the London County Council may resolve that the case in question is not of general importance to the County of London, and should be dealt with under Part 2 by the Local Authority. The Secretary of State may appoint an Arbitrator to hold an enquiry, and decide whether it should be dealt with under Part 1 or Part 2 of the Act. There are several other Sections as to the manner of raising money and generally carrying out the Act. A representation from the Medical Officer of Health of the County Council has a like effect as a representation of the Medical Officcr of Health of the Parish or District. Under Section 81, the Local Authority is empowered to appoint Committees for the purposes of the Act.
