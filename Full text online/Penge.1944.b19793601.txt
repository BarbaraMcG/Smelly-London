Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present an abridged annual Report on the health of the district for the year ending the 31st December, 1944. It is compiled in accordance with Circular 49 (1945) of the Ministry of Health and does not include matters connected with the Civil Defence Services. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 770 Population (Census, 1931) 27,771 Population mid-year 1944 (estimated by Registrar General) 17,86 0 Rateable value £204,56 0 Sum represented by 1d. rate £718 The Manager of the Employment Exchange informed me that there were 3 persons unemployed in the Penge Urban District at the end of the year, compared with 4 men and. 7 women in 1943. The Out-door relief given during the yea; amounted to £10,916 of which £164 was to able-bodied unemployed and their families and the balance to the unemployable from age or other causes. This compares with an amount of £11,691 of which £374 was to able-bodied unemployed and their families in the year 1943. VITAL STATISTICS. Birth rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population, 19.3 Still-birth rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births, 33.6 Crude death rate per 1,000 of the estimated Civilian population, 20.5 Deaths from Puerperal causes:- Rate per 1,000 total (live and still births. Puerperal sepsis Nil Other maternal causes 2.80 Death rate of Infants under one year of age: - All infants, per 1,000 live births 107.2 Legitimate infants, per 1000 legitimate live births 100.6 Illegitimate infants, per 1,000 illegitimate live births 105.1 Births. The live birth rate per 1,000 civilian population was 19.3, compared with 19.3 for 1943. Still-births. The rate rate 1,000 total births was 33.6, compared with 26.8 for 1943. 1. Deaths . The crude death rate for the year equalled 20.3 per 1,000 civilian population, compared with 15.3 for 1943. Civilian deaths due to war operations totalled 98 or 26.9% of the deaths registered. Of the total deaths, 56% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 58,4% the previous year, Cancer . The Cancer death rate per 1,000 civilian population was 1.90, compared with 2.60 in 1943. Maternal Mortallty. There were no maternal deaths from puerperal sepsis or abortion during the year'. One death occurred whilst the Mother was undergoing a Caesarian section. This gives a maternal mortality rate of 2.80 per 1,000 live and still births. There were no deaths the previous year. Infanti1e Mortallty. The death rate of infants under one year of age was 107,2 per 1,000 births compared with rate of 41.3 for 1943, this being the highest rate recorded in the district since 1919, Of the 37 deaths, 17 died before reaching the age of 1 week, seven of whom lived for only a few hours. I am of opinion that enemy air activity in the area was a contributory cause in a number of deaths, inasmuch as 10 of the infants died from congenital defects and 11 from prematurity. One infant died as a result of war operations. Eight deaths occurred amongst infants who had attended the Child Welfare Centre. Comparative Vital Statistics. The following table shows the comparative figures for 1944. Rate per 1,000 Civilian Population. Death rate per 1,000 Civilian Population.

There was a marked decrease in the attendances at the Centre during the year, due to the evacuation of mothers and children during the summer and autumn months in consequence of increased enemy air activity.

Town Hall, Anerley, .S.E.20. July, 1945. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr.Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you the Annual Report of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors (excluding that in connection with, Civil Defence) for the year ending the 31st December, 1944. In addition to verbal intimation of defects found in premises, 247 written informal notices and 13 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. Two hundred and thirty four intimation notices and 10 statutory notices were complied with. The Council did the work required by 11 notices served under Section 24 of the Public Health Act, 1936, respecting 19 premises and 3 notices served under Section 39 of the Public Health Act, 1936. Legal proceedings were taken for non-compliance with a notice served during 1943 regarding a statutory nuisance caused by housing defects, with the following result:- Order made to comply with Notice with in one month and to pay £3.3.0. costs and Court costs. The owner appealed at the West Kent Quarter Sessions against the Order made by the Penge Justices, when the appeal was dismissed and the Council awarded £15.15.0. costs. The drainage systems of 42 houses were partially relaid and 75 cleared of obstructions. The shortage of labour and materials again necessitated attention being given only to the more serious items of disrepair in houses, and in consequence a deterioration in the condition of property has taken place.
