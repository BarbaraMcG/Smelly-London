To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and. sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1920. Population. The civil population of the Borough to the middle of 1920 has been estimated by the Registrar General to be 346,990 for the purpose of calculating death-rates and 347,588 for birth-rates. The population, uncorrected for Institutions, as estimated from an enumeration of the ration books, was found to be 351,370. Table I. shows the population of each sub-district based on the above estimation, compared with the Census population. TABLE I. Sub-District. Census Population, 1911. Population estimated to middle of 1920. Corrected. Uncorrected. Clapham 58,592 66,728 66,903 Putney 28,242 29,019 30,212 Streatham 96,192 107,184 107,520 Tooting 35,958 38,877 41,656 Wandsworth 92,376 101,000 105,079 Whole Borough 311,360 342,808 351,370 The estimated population in Table I. is used to calculate all the rates in this Report, 2 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Physical Features and General Character of the Borough. With regard to this, the Borough is fortunate in possessing a considerable number of parks and open spaces, and, in addition, there are parks in the County of Surrey adjacent to those in this Borough. The total area of the Borough is 9,108 acres, and the approximate area of parks and open spaces is 1,130 acres. This area is largely increased by Wimbledon Common and Richmond Park, portions of both of these being in the Borough. Social Conditions. In my report for 1919 a short statement of the social conditions in the Borough was given, but this may be to' some extent altered during the last decennium. In 1921 the Census report will be available, and a short resume will be given in the report for that year. Births. During the year 1920, 7,212 births, 3,707 of males and 3,505 of females, occurred, compared with 5,441 in 1919. The total number of births in this Borough was 7,179, but 679 births occurred in Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough, and 646 births in Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, making a corrected total of 7,212. In Table II. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Boroue-h. TABLE II. Sub-Distriot BIRTHS.

The birth-rate was 21.03 per 1,000, compared with 16.40 for 1919, and 19.08 the decennial average. There was a considerable increase in the number of births during the year, Compared with the decennial average, and especially since 1915.

All house-to-house inspections under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are carried out as if these were inspections under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, and the results recorded on a special card which was drawn up in 1910, and has been in use since that date. This method has been found to work most satisfactorily. Where nuisances are found notices are served under the Public Health Act, and if the premises are reported by the Sanitary Inspector to be in a bad condition, I make a personal inspecton in order to determine if the houses are in such a condition as to be unfit for human habitation. During the year 3,348 house-to-house inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors, and in 3,091 nuisances were found necessitating the service of sanitary notices. Of thje 62 premises reported in 1919 as unfit for human habitation, two have been closed, and three have been rendered fit for habitation and the closing orders determined. The total number of houses where the drains were reconstructed during the year was 131; 28 in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 31 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 46 in Wandsworth. During the year 4,950 drains of houses were tested by the Sanitary Inspectors, 824 in Clapham, 295 in Putney, 1,081 in Streatham, 738 in Tooting, and 2,012 in Wandsworth, and 390, or 8.73 per cent. were found to be defective. Of the 390 found defective, 51 were in Clapham, 18 in Putney, 156 in Streatham, 74 in Tooting, and 91 in Wandsworth. A large amount of work has again been carried out to abate nuisances arising from damp conditions. In all, 1,885 premises have been dealt with, 498 in Clapham, 159 in Putney, 460 in Streatham, 198 in Tooting, and 570 in Wandsworth; and in 422 of these, 185 in Clapham, 33 in Putney, 70 in Streatham, 52 in Tooting, and 82 in Wandsworth, damp courses have been inserted. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 37 Removal of House Refuse. During- the year no alteration has been made in the system of removal. The whole of the refuse is now collected and disposed of by contract, with the exception of a portion from the Balham, Streatham and Tooting Wards, which is disposed of at the Destructor. 162 statutory notices were served under Section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide ashpits in accordance with the Bv-laws, and these have been complied with. Police Court Proceedings. The list which follows shows particulars of Police Court proceeding's under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891.

There has been an increase in the total number of inspections of the above, compared with 1919, and an examination of the Tables will show that a very large amount of work has been carried out by both the male and female inspectors. 41 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. ‚Ä† The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer‚Äîin some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 45 The total number of addresses received from other Councils was 619, and 234 addresses were forwarded to other Councils. The number of addresses received has increased by 42, and the number sent increased by 13. 17 names and addresses were forwarded to this Borough in error, and are not included in the above Table. The number of notices sent to employers during the year was 43, and these had a most satisfactory result. During the year 30 cases of infective diseases, five of Scarlet Fever, nine of Diphtheria, 11 of Measles, two of Pneumonia, and three of Whooping-cough, were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers. In none of these cases was it necessary to make any order under Section 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act. TABLE XXXI. 4‚ÄîREGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

Canal Boats Act. During the year eight inspections of Canal Boats were made, but it was not necessary to serve any notices, as on inspection the condition of all the boats was found to be satisfactory. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 47 Rats and Mice Destruction. The officer appointed by the Council to carry out the provisions of the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, commenced duty on the 23rd February, and from that date to the end of the year he made 2,715 visits to premises where complaints had been made of rat or mice infestation. 291 of the visits were in Clapham, 440 in Putney, 501 in Streatham, 497 in Tooting, and 986 in Wandsworth, and record was made of the destruction of 5,676 rats, 415 in Clapham, 542 in Putney, 1,073 in Streatham, 394 in Tooting, and 3,252 in Wandsworth. Judging by the above results, I am of opinion that the appointment of such an officer has been justified. It was found necessary to serve 18 notices on occupiers of premises which were rat infested, and these notices were complied with, but by far the greater number of occupiers carried out the instructions of the officer with successful results. Some difficulty was experienced in dealing with the rat infestation of some small areas inhabited by persons who were unable to> pay for the services of the Rat Officer, and the Public Health Committee gave instructions for the officer to do the work necessary in these cases free of charge. Very few cases of mice infestation have been brought to the notice of the Rat Officer. Schools. All the elementary Schools in the Borough were inspected as usual, and the sanitary conditions found to be satisfactory. There is close co-operation between this Department and the London County Council with regard to the prevention of infectious disease at the public elementary schools. In certain cases during the year where it was observed that the number of cases of infectious diseases was excessive, the attention of the 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. London County Council was at once called to the matter, and the school was inspected by the officials of that Authority, and the result of the inspection reported. In schools which are not under the London County Council, if any cases occur the school is visited and the proprietors are advised as to the proper steps to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. Disinfection has been carried out during the year for various infectious diseases in eight public elementary schools and in four private schools. FOOD. Milk Supply. The milk supplied to this Borough has been, during the year, of fair quality, very few complaints having been made with regard to its wholesomeness or purity. The average fat content shown by the samples analysed was 3.56 per cent., compared with 349 in 1919. So far as could be ascertained there has been no shortage of milk supplied to the Borough, the supply being equal to the demand. There are at present eight cowsheds and 441 milk retailers on the Register, and these have been regularly inspected during the year. Particulars of these are given in Table XXXIII. No action has been taken during the year with regard to tuberculous milk, as the London County Council has dealt with this matter for some years past.

The Council decided on the 11th April, 1918, to supply, under the Milk (Mothers and Children) Order, milk free of cost to necessitous expectant and nursing mothers, and to children under five years of age. This scheme came into force on the 1st May, 1918. All applications are investigated, and should the income per head after deducting rent, insurance, and travelling expenses of breadwinner, fall below the scale approved by the Council, viz., 10s. per week, the milk is supplied up to two pints daily for a nursing or expectant mother, 1¬Ω pints for a child under 18 months, and one pint between the ages of 18 months and five years. Cases in which the average income is slightly over the scale, and there is need for extra milk, are referred to the Medical Officer of Health, who authorises the allowance. During 1920, 1,220 families were supplied with free milk at a cost to the Borough Council of ¬£4,583. Free dinners were also granted to necessitous, expectant and nursing mothers, and to children under five years of age, on the same scale. The necessity for the supply of free dinners was not found to be very urgent. 70 mothers and 84 children were so helped during the year, arrangements being made with local eating houses in each district to provide the dinners at a cost of one Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 51 shilling per head for mothers and sixpence per head for children. This amounted during the year to ¬£150. The total number of visits paid respecting the supply of milk and of meals amounted to 3,087. Meat. There are no public abattoirs in the Borough, and the Sanitary Inspectors periodically inspect the slaughterhouses and arrange as far as possible to be there on the days that slaughtering of animals takes place. 112 inspections of the 11 slaughterhouses were made during the year, and 1,617 carcases were examined by the Inspectors. No action has been taken with regard to unsound meat, and no carcases were condemned during the year. By far the greater proportion of the meat sold in the Borough has been inspected in the Central Markets before being sold to retailers. In 1914. In January, 1920. In December, 1920.

Most of the bacon, beef, mutton and rabbits were sent to a fat melter in the Borough to be converted into glycerine. Inspection of Milkshops, Cowsheds, etc. The following Table shows in concise form the number of milk premises, cowsheds, etc., on the register, the number of inspections, and the number of cases of legal proceedings during the year, as well as other information which it has been thought advisable to group together for the purpose of comparison with other Metropolitan Boroughs.

Statement of work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the year 1,867 samples of foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these samples 995 were purchased as test or informal samples, while 872 were purchased officially. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 53 Of the 872 official samples submitted for analysis 67, or 7.6 per cent. were reported to be adulterated or not up to standard, and of those samples which were purchased informally or as test samples, 42, or 4.2 per cent. were found adulterated or not up to standard. The total adulterations reported were 109, or 5.8 per cent. of the samples submitted. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 7.5. In 40 out of the 67 cases in which adulterations were detected in the official samples, proceedings were instituted against the vendor, and the total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year amounted to ¬£100, and the costs to ¬£42 16s. 6d., making a total of ¬£142 16s, 6d. The following Table shows the number of formal and informal samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the number taken per 1,000 of population, the number adulterated, and the percentage adulterated to the formal and informal and to the total samples taken.

Milk and Cream. MILK. 886 samples of milk w,ere procured for analysis during the year. 68 or 7.5 per cent. were reported against as being adulterated or not up to legal standard. 865 samples were purchased officially, of which 62 or 7.0 per cent, were adulterated, and 21 samples purchased informally, of which six, or 28 per cent., were adulterated. 20 samples were found to contain added water, 21 were deficient in milk fat, eight were deficient in milk fat and contained added water, 11 contained colouring matter, and two contained both colouring matter and extraneous water. Proceedings were taken in 36 cases, and in 26 cases the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of sale, decided not to prosecute the vendors, but to take further samples. Three samples of milk were taken on delivery at various Public Institutions situated within the Borough. These samples were genuine. 17 samples of milk were procured whilst in transit from the farmer to the retailer, the samples being taken as the milk arrived at various railway stations within the Borough, both at mid-night and mid-day deliveries. Six samples were reported against, and proceedings were taken against the farmers, and convictions obtained. Three samples of milk were procured during the early morning from wholesale dealers whilst delivering milk to the retailer. These samples were genuine. 12 samples of milk were procured on delivery at private houses. One sample was reported against, and proceedings taken, the offence being proved against the roundsman, who was convicted and sent to prison for one month. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 110 samples of milk have been taken on Sundays, either in the early morning or at mid-day. 11, or 10 per cent. were reported against as being adulterated. 390 samples of milk were taken from milk vendors in the street during the early morning (i.e., 5 to 7 a.m.), on week days, and of these 40 or 10 per cent. were reported against. In 21 cases the defendants relied on a warranty, and in 11 of these the Magistrate was satisfied that the milk sold was in the same condition as received, and therefore dismissed the summonses. In three cases the Magistrate was not satisfied, and convicted the defendants, in one an order for the costs was made, and in one case where warranty was proved, proceedings were taken against the warrantor for giving a false warrant. The Magistrate, in dismissing the case, made the following remarks :‚Äî " I must dismiss this case. In a similar case to- this I convicted and the Sessions said I was wrong. "The consequences to London are serious. Pure milk is of the utmost importance to all, particularly to children. They will not get it whilst things remain as they are. " The farmer in the country warrants that his milk will arrive pure in London. He cannot, of course, see to it or control it. He cannot be convicted if he sends it off all right; that is the decision of the Sessions. The retailer cannot be convicted if he sells it as he receives it. The result is milk with 50 per cent, of water may be sold and no conviction follow. " I thought if the farmer warranted that which he could not perform he could be convicted, but the Sessions say he cannot be. If so, the position is hopeless, and the matter requires legislation. In my opinion the Borough Councils of London will never get things right till they one and all intimate that it is useless to prosecute until the law is put into a reasonable shape in this matter. " I should like to' add that the Vice-Chairman of the Sessions in giving his decision, said the case resembled that of a passenger who was not to be expected to look alter his luggage and see it was safe in transit. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. " But I am afraid there is an analogy here which is quite unsound, as the passenger does not warrant the safety of the luggage, and if that is the ground of the decision, although I shall follow it, I do not agree with it." Milk and Cream Regulations. 41 samples of cream and 33 of preserved cream were submitted for analysis. Three informal samples of preserved cream were reported against. Further samples taken were found to be genuine. Butter and Margarine. BUTTER. 632 samples of butter were submitted for analysis during the year, of which 20, or 3.1 per cent., were reported against. MARGARINE. Nine samples of margarine were submitted for analysis, two of which were reported against. OTHER ARTICLES. A full list of the articles of food and drugs examined under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, together with the analytical results, is contained in the Report of the Public Analyst. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Table XXXV. shows the cases of infectious diseases notified during the year. The total number of cases, less tuberculosis, was 4,820, 913 from Clapham, 304 from Putney, 1,359 from Streatham, 767 from Tooting, and 1,479 from Wandsworth‚Äîcompared with 1,984 in 1919. The number appears high, but it includes 1,343 cases of whooping cough. Measles and German measles ceased to be notifiable diseases on 31st December, 1919, and any information as to the incidence of these diseases was obtained chiefly on Form 84 from the London County Council elementary schools. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria, puerperal fever, and ophthalmia neonatorum, and a decrease of enteric fever, erysipelas, cerebro-spinal meningitis, polio-myelitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other forms of tuberculosis. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 59 Scarlet Fever. This disease was slightly more prevalent during the year, compared with 1919. In all 1,463 cases were notified, 286 in Clapham, 136 in Putney, 391 in Streatham, 240 in Tooting, and 410 in Wandsworth, compared with 893 in 1919. The rate per 1,000 of population was 4.16, 4.27 in Clapham, 4.5 in Putney, 3.6 in Streatham, 5.7 in Tooting, and 3.9 in Wandsworth. The disease was more prevalent in all parts of the Borough, compared with the previous 10 years, but it was slightly more prevalent in Tooting and Putney. The disease was of a very mild type, only 11 deaths having occurred, or a case mortality of only .75 per cent., which is exceptionally low. Thirty cases occurred in an institution in Clapham, and 28 cases among the nursing staff in an institution in Tooting. Of the total number of cases, viz.‚Äî1,463, 1,255 or 85 per cent., were removed to hospital. From January to August the number of cases notified was slightly above the average, but in September the numbers increased, and in October, November and December there was a widespread epidemic; 645, or 44 per cent. of the total cases during the year, having been notified in these three months. This epidemic was general over the whole of London. As will be seen in Table XLI., some schools were more affected than others, The Medical Officers of the London County Council made inspections of 17 schools during the year, and any suspected cases were at once excluded and the names forwarded to me for inquiry. 60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It will be seen that Hotham Road School, Putney, had a large number of cases, and although exclusions of suspects had been carried out, cases still occurred. In consequence of the continued prevalence in that school I advised the school to be closed from the 12th to the 29th November. Only six cases occurred after the 15th November to the end of the year. The number of dwellings in each sub-district and the whole Borough in which multiple cases occurred is shown in the following Table :‚Äî TABLE XXXVII. Sub-Districts. One case. Two cases. Three cases.

Of the 1,185 houses invaded, multiple cases occurred in 167 or 14.09 per cent. Diphtheria. This disease was very prevalent during the year, especially in January, February, March, October, November and December*. The total number of cases notified was 1,104, 225 in Clap- Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 61 ham, 60 in Putney, 387 in Streatham, 136 in Tooting, and 296 in Wandsworth. The rate per 1,000 of population was 3.1, 3.3 in Clapham, 1.9 in Putney, 3.6 in Streatham, 3.2 in Tooting, and 2.8 in Wandsworth. The number of cases was 579 above the number in 1919, and 599 above the corrected decennial average. Of the 1,104 cases, 925, or 83 per cent., were removed to hospital. With the exception of a localised outbreak in Streatham, particulars of which are given in the following report, there was no special outbreak during the year :‚Äî Report on Diphtheria in Streatham. "The first case was notified on the 18th December, 1919, and was removed to hospital on the same day. This patient in all probability contracted the disease at a Cinema on the 15th December, 1919. The next case was notified on the 22nd of December, this patient having been in contact with the first case. This was followed by one on the 24th December, who occupied the same bedroom as the first case. No further cases occurred till January 15th, 1920, when one case was notified, followed by one on the 16th, two on the 20th, one on the 22nd, one on the 23rd, one on the 24th, one on the 29th, two on the 30th, one on the 2nd February, and two on the 9th; a total of 16, 12 of whom were in residence at the place of business. Swabbing of the throats of the contacts was carried out and those in whom positive results were obtained and in whom no clinical symptoms appeared, were isolated and kept under careful observation. Repeated swabs were taken, and not until negative results were obtained, were they allowed to resume their duties, 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. All the cases in whom clinical symptoms developed were of a mild type, no deaths having occurred. The premises were thoroughly inspected by myself and the Sanitary Inspector on several occasions, and nothing was discovered that would account for the outbreak except personal contact. The milk supply was inquired into, and it was reported that all milk supplied was sterilised. The usual disinfection was carried out by the staff. No fresh notifications have been received since the 9th February, but several of the bacteriological cases have been under observation up to the 1st March." In January and February some difficulty was experienced in having cases promptly removed to hospital, but during the rest of the year, cases were removed at once. With regard to schools the highest number of cases occurred among children attending Mitcham Lane School, the next Earlsfield School, and the third Eardley Road School. The following schools were visited by the Medical Officers of the London County Council, and swabs taken from the throats of some of the pupils examined. In Clapham, Stonhouse Street, St. Andrew's Street, Haselrigge Road, Cavendish Road, Clapham Parochial, and New Road Schools; in Putney, Hotham Road School; in Streatham, Sunnyhill Road, Oldridge Road, Mitcham Lane, Eardley Road, Hearnville Road, Hillbrook Road, Fircroft Roqad, and Broadwater Road Schools; in Tooting, the Ensham and Toot'ng Graveney Schools; and in Wandsworth, Garratt Lane, Swaffield Road, the Earlsfield, Brandlehow Road, and the RiversdaJe Schools. As a result of this swabbing 79 cases were found to be positive and 42 suspicious. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 63 All the cases were swabbed again and not readmitted to school till found negative. Every positive or suspicious case was visited and all necessary precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The number of dwellings in each sub-district and the whole Borough in which multiple cases occurred is shown in the next Table. TABLE XXXVIII. Sub-Districts. One case. Two cases. Three cases.

Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 57 cases of scarlet fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and there were also 13 cases of Diphtheria. 14 of the return cases of scarlet fever occurred in Clapham, seevn in Putney, 18 in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 14 in Wandsworth. Two of the return cases of diphtheria occurred in Clapham, seven in Streatham, and four in Wandsworth. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Enteric Fever. Twenty-four cases of enteric fever were notified during; the year, nine from Clapham, five from Putney, five from Streatham and five from Wandsworth. Two of the cases on admission to hospital were found not to be suffering from enteric fever. The number of cases is six above that of last year, but 27 below the corrected decennial average. Three of the cases were notified as para-typhoid fever, and all these recovered. Two of the cases contracted the disease abroad, and two had partaken of shell-fish about fourteen days previous to the onset of the disease. In the other 17 cases no definite history of infection could be obtained. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 55 cases (19 of scarlet fever, 27 of diphtheria, two of enteric fever, six of cerebro-spinal fever, and one of encephalitis lethargica) information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's and other hospitals that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified, or any other notifiable disease. Cerebrospinal Meningitis. During the year 15 cases of this disease were notified (two Clapham", three in Streatham, three in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth). Thirteen of the cases were removed to hospital. The following Table gives particulars of these cases, 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXIX. Cerebro=Spinal Fever. No. of Cases.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 71 As will be seen from the Table, eight of the eases died from Encephalitis Lethargica, and one from Chronic Nephritis. Six of the cases are still under treatment, but recovering, and three have recovered without any after effects. Of the cases notified in 1919 Nos. 5, 7 and 8 are still in good health. Polio=myelitis and Polioencephalitis. No cases were notified during the year. Of the cases notified in 1919, No. 3 has right arm still paralysed; No. 1 has right leg still weak, but child is at school; No. 6 paralysis of left leg and foot continues with no improvement; No, 7 is recovering slowly; and No. 8 has dropped foot on right side, but is otherwise well. Erysipelas. 173 cases were notified (35 in Clapham, 12 in Putney, 39 in Streatham, 19 in Tooting and 68 in Wandsworth). Measles and German Measles. The notification of these diseases was discontinued at the end of 1919, but 70 cases were notified by doctors during the year, although the greatest number was reported by the teachers of the elementary schools. As will be seen from Table XLI. 2,155 cases were reported from this source, but the number reported is necessarily much under the number of cases that occurred, as there was no report from the numerous private schools in the Borough, and even from the elementary schools there were no reports during the summer vacation. Cases under five years of age are not reported unless the children are in attendance at school, and thi is only the case between four and five years. 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From a comparison of the number reported under five years in the previous year, when notification was compulsory, there is a decided decrease. As by far the greatest mortality occurs under five years of age 1 am of opinion that further steps should be taken to obtain information, and 1 do not think any other method than the compulsory notification, as before, would be satisfactory. Fortunately the disease during 1920 was of a comparatively mild type, only 47 deaths taking place, 39 of these being under five years of age. In all 2,554 cases were reported, 44 under one year, 614 from one and under five years, 1,980 from five and under 15 years, and 16 over 15 years. 404 cases occurred in Clapham, 250 in Putney, 637 in Streatham, 206 in looting, and 1,057 in Wandsworth. Twenty-six of the cases were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals on account of insufficient accommodation at home. 83 cases of German Measles were also reported (five in Clapham, three in Putney, 15 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 52 in Wandsworth). During the year 2,005 visits were made in cases of these diseases, 107 in Clapham, 202 in Putney, 561 in Streatham, 157 in Tooting, and 978 in Wandsworth). The total number of premises disinfected was 1,292 (142 in Clapham, 135 in Putney, 349 in Streatham, 97 in Tooting, and 569 in Wandsworth).

Whooping Cough. 1,343 cases were notified (235 in Clapham, 34 in Putney, 355 in Streatham, 276 in Tooting and 443 in Wandsworth). 130 of these were infants under one year of age, 477 from one and under five years, 722 from five and under 15 years, six from 15 and under 25 years, and eight over 25 years. Four cases were removed to hospital. This disease was more prevalent in the Borough during the year, with the exception of Putney, in which there was a decrease in the number of cases notified. The disease was not very fatal, and there is no doubt that notification and visits paid by the Health Visitors have had a most beneficial effect in reducing the mortality. Influenzal Pneumonia and Acute Primary Pneumonia. During the year 97 cases of Influenzal Pneumonia were notified, 19 in Clapham, four in Putney, 38 in Streatham, 18 in Tooting-, and 18 in Wandsworth, compared with 198 in 1919. Three of the cases were from one and under five years, 11 from five and under 15 years, 12 from 15 and under 25 years, eight from 25 and under 45 years, 12 from 45 and under 65 years, and ten over 65 years. 408 notifications of cases of Acute Primary Pneumonia were received (65 in Clapham, 33 in Putney, 96 in Streatham, 45 in Tooting and 169 in Wandsworth), compared with 213 in 1919. 41 of the cases were infants under one year, 74 from one and under five years, 59 from five and under 15 years, 33 from 15 andl under 25 years, 77 from 25 and under 45 years, 81 from 45 and under 65 years, and 43 over 65 years. All the cases were visited, and when requested by the medical attendant or householder the premises, etc., were disinfected by the sanitary staff of the Council. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 77 Malaria. 68 cases were notified (seven in Clapham, seven in Putney, 14 in Streatham, 18 in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth). All of the cases but one were males. No case was notified in which the disease was contracted within the Borough. Of 61 Army cases, 24 contracted the disease in Salonica, two in Palestine, two in Egypt, seven in Mesopotamia, one in East Africa, 17 in India, and eight in other parts. The one female notified contracted the disease in India. These 68 cases were visited again at the end of the year, and it was found that 34 were still suffering, seven had removed, 23 were stated to be well, three died, and in one no inquiries were made. Every case notified was visited to ascertain that proper treatment was being given, and any cases where the patients were not having proper medical attention were advised to attend a special hospital. There was no spread of infection among the civil population. Of the 196 cases notified in 1919, 117 were visited in 1920, the remainder, viz.: 79, having either recovered or left the Borough. It was found that of the 117, 49 were still suffering, 22 had removed, 45 were stated to be well, and one died. Dysentery. Eight cases were notified (one in Clapham, two in Putney, three in Streatham, and two in Tooting). All the cases were males, and in six the disease was contracted during Army service in the following war areas: four in France and two in India. None of the cases were engaged in the preparation of food or drink for human consumption. The cases notified in 1920 were again visited at the end of 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. the year, and it was found that four were still suffering, two had removed, and two were stated to> be well. Of the cases notified in 1919, six were still suffering, and one had died from Cancer of the rectum. Trench Fever. Two cases were notified, both being soldiers who contracted the disease in France in 1916 and 1917. The premises were thoroughly inspected and no evidence of vermin could be obtained. One case was notified from a mental hospital and was probably a case of mucous colitis, and in the other case no information could be obtained as the patient was in hospital. The one case notified in 1919 was visited and found to be in good health. Bacteriological Aids to Diagnosis. These have been utilised to a large extent during the year, and a statement of the work carried out is given on page 123. Contacts. Careful inquiry is made with regard to contacts in every case of infectious disease notified, and the necessary action taken. 190 adults had baths after being in contact with cases of infectious disease. Arrangements for Isolation. Of the total number of cases of infectious diseases notified 2,308, or 48 per cent., were removed to' the Metropolitan Asylums Board or other isolation hospitals. In all the cases kept at home the isolation was carried out to' my satisfaction. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 6,066 (976 in Clapham, 538 in Putney, 1,823 in Streatham 727 in Tooting, and 2,002 in Wandsworth). Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 79 2,948 lots of bedding were staved at the Disinfecting Station, comprising the following articles: 1,684 beds, 1,820 bolsters, 4,473 pillows, 2,400 mattresses, 66 palliasses, 4,183 sheets, 2,663 quilts, 730 cushions, 8,897 articles of clothing, 5,425 blankets, 65 carpets, and 5,465 extra articles; a total of 37,871 articles. Disinfection was also carried out by the Sanitary Staff at premises after non-notifiable diseases, and the sum of ¬£44 12s. 3d. was received for such disinfection. 384 rooms were disinfected with sulphur in consequence of their verminous condition, and 42 lots of verminous bedding disinfected. During the year, at the request of the Military Authorities, 6,020 articles of clothing and bedding were disinfected and ten rooms sprayed on account of having been exposed to> infection. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was ¬£2,402 3s. 9d. The number of lots of beading stoved was 2,948. Cost per lot of bedding ¬£0 16s. 5d. Carrier Cases. Very few carrier cases came to> the knowledge of the Department during the year under review, but the usual procedure in the case of Diphtheria was to' keep the children at home, and periodical swabs were taken until two successive negative results were obtained. Dysentery Carriers. In 1919 information was received from the Ministry of Health of ten cases of chronic carriers of entamoeba histolytica. These cases were visited periodically during the year, and at the last visit, early in 1921, it was found that three had completely rceovered, and that seven were still suffering. Two of the latter were notified as cases of dysentery. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Notification of Tuberculous Diseases. The total number of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified during 1920 was 634, (104 were from Clapham, 52 from Putney, 180 from Streatham, 97 from Tooting, and 201 from Wandsworth), compared with 788 in 1919, 777 in 1918, and 690, the decennial average. There was a marked reduction in all the sub-districts with the exception of Putney, where the number of cases was only one less than the previous year. One of the cases was under one year, four from one and under five years, 38 from five and under 15 years, 162 from 15 and under 25 years, 297 from 25 and under 45 years, 122 from 45 and under 65 years, and ten over 65 years. At all the ages with the exception of under one year there was a decrease compared with the previous year. In Table XLII. is shown the total number of cases notified since 1909, the number of deaths in each year since that date, the total deaths, the number removed from the district as far as could be ascertained, the number who were stated to have recovered, and the total number of cases still on the Register.

Of these 6,401, 2,727 or 42.6 per cent. died during the nine years, 1,267 or 20 per cent. have removed from the Borough, 157 or 2.4 per cent. have, as far as could be ascertained, recovered, while 2,250 or 36.7 per cent. remain on the Register. The total on the Register, including those notified in 1909 to 1911, was 2,327, compared with 2,265 in 1919. With regard to the notification of cases of non-pulmonary Tuberculosis, in all 156 cases were notified (23 from Clapham, five from Putney, 36 from Streatham, 24 from Tooting, and 68 from Wandsworth). Six of the cases were under one year, 21 from one and under five years, 65 from five and under 15 years, 29 from 15 and under 25 years, 25 from 25 and under 45 years, and seven over 45 years of age. Table XLIII. shows the number of these cases notified classified according to the part of the body affected, as well as the number of deaths in each class. It will be seen from this Table that by far the most fatal form of Tuberculosis is Tuberculosis of the Brain, of which 30 cases were notified and 29 died.

In addition to these visits by the Health Visitor, 3,528 visits were made by the Dispensary Nurses, these visits being made by the instruction of the Tuberculosis Officer to cases under his care at the Dispensary. During the year 17 sputum flasks have been supplied, and in eight of the cases visited the patients already had one. During the year disinfection was carried out at 298 premises either after the death or removal of the patient. 61 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 101 in Streatham, 31 in Tooting, and 86 in Wandsworth. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARIES. There are two Dispensaries in the Borough, at 96, East Hill, Wandsworth, and 114, Gosberton Road, Balham. The former was opened on 24th December, 1919, when the premises at 129, East Hill were given up, and the latter on 8th June, 1920, when the use of the Weir Dispensary was discontinued. Staff.‚ÄîThe Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. F. G. Caley, half of whose time is given to dispensary work and half to his work as Assistant Medical Officer of Health. The Assistant Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. A. W. Forrest, who commenced his duties on 18th October, and gives all his time to dispensary work. The Staff consists of two nurses, a clerk-dispenser, and a third-class clerk. Details of 1920 Patients.‚ÄîThe Tables which follow give the details of the work carried out during the year.

There is a large fall in the total attendances, and this is due to causes touched on in last year's report, viz., the curtailment of treatment generally, especially of children who are in poor health but not definite cases of Tuberculosis. A certain number of these are now referred to the School Medical Service to deal with, and most of them are advised to attend the dispensaries periodically for re-examination, and so far this arrangement has worked satisfactorily. Owing to the drop in the attendances and to the increase in the number of sessions, made possible by the appointment of a Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 87 second Medical Officer, much more individual attention can now be given to those cases which require thorough investigation. This is undoubtedly a move in the right direction. Further, it is now poss ble for the Medical Officers to get into closer contact with the conditions under which the patients live by personallv visiting the homes.

Institutional Treatment.‚ÄîAll institutional treatment is arranged for by the London Insurance Committee and the London County Council, and there are no residential institutions under the control of the Borough Council. Co-operation with other Institutions.‚ÄîWith regard to co-operation with general and special hospitals, an arrangement with St. Thomas's Hospital for referring to the Hospital cases of difficulty and those requiring special investigation has been in existence since the dispensary scheme commenced in 1913, and has always worked smoothly. At the present time the co-operation is very close, and patients are continually being referred under this arrangement for X-ray examinations, the opinion of a throat surgeon, or for other reasons. Further, patients in need of some special outpatient treatment, not available at the dispensaries, are dealt with in this way. During the year 67 cases were referred to the hospital, most of them for X-ray examination, or for an opinion on the condition of the larynx. With regard to School Clinics, a few children are referred to the dispensaries by the schools, but only occasionally does a medical report accompany the child. When questioned, the mother usually says that the school mistress advised her to bring the child. This system might be improved upon. Women and children are also sent by the Medical Officers of the Welfare Centres for examination. The co-operation with medical practitioners is improving, and the number of cases referred by them has increased during the last four years. In 1920 tne number was 307, compared with 209, 234, and 175 for the three previous years. A few 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. ports on domiciliary treatment are sent to the Tuberculosis Officer by practitioners. Special Methods of Diagnosis and Treatment.‚ÄîWith regard to special methods of diagnosis and treatment, X-ray and throat examinations are made at St. Thomas's Hospital, as mentioned before, and the reports received have helped materi. ally to make diagnosis more accurate. Only rarely is Tuberculin used as a diagnostic agent, as it is thought that closer observation than can be given in dispensary practice is necessary to gauge the results with accuracy. Tuberculin as a curative agent is used much less frequently than formerly, as the results have been far from convincing. A few patients have been treated with vaccine, but the definite cases of Tuberculosis to whom this treatment is beneficial are not numerous. Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis.‚ÄîCases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis come to the dispensaries, and those in need of institutional treatment are dealt with by the Insurance Committee and the London County Council. The dispensary treatment of these cases is necessarily limited, as many are bed cases or are in need of surgical treatment. Those under dispensary treatment are mainly cases of glands in the neck. Dental Treatment.‚ÄîBy an arrangement with the British Dentists' Hospital, dental treatment, including the provision of dentures, is provided for those in need of it. This treatment is limited to those suffering from Tuberculosis, and it has been found that in only a small proportion of these is the condition of the teeth so bad as to require treatment before the more serious complaint. During the year 18 patients received dental treatment, and six were supplied with dentures. In addition, a few ex-service men received dental treatment through the Local Pensions Committees. Nursing and Extra Nourishment.‚Äî Home nursing for those in need of it is carried out by the District Nurses, and the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 91 dispensary staff frequently make the necessary arrangements for the patients. Extra nourishment for patients at home is provided through the following agencies:‚ÄîInsurance Committee, Lcoal Pensions Committees, Poor Law Authorities, and numerous voluntary organisations, according to the circumstances of the case. Shelters.‚ÄîTwo shelters provided by the Borough Council are in use by patients under treatment in their homes. One advanced case of Tuberculosis of the lung and spine has used the shelter consistently for over a year, and has derived benefit from it. The other shelter has been in use by a case of Tubercular Laryngitis for a short time only. It has been found that the use of shelters amongst working class patients is restricted by the difficulty in taking the shelter through the house to the back yard, owing to the size of its component parts, and, further, that many homes have insufficient back yard accommodation. Following Up.‚ÄîThe following up of patients in whom the diagnosis is doubtful, is carried out by the nurses who visit all such cases. Contacts.‚ÄîThe examination of contacts is carried out at the dispensaries where possible, and the appointments are made by the Health Visitors and Nurses. It is sometimes possible to examine a few, who neglect to attend, at their own homes, and this is done where necessary. During the year 532 contacts were examined and 20 of them were found to< be suffering from Tuberculosis ; these figures are included in the tables showing the year's work. During their routine visits to the cases, the nurses also make enquiries about the health of the contacts, and doubtful 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. ones are re-examined by the doctors. In this way a certain supervision is kept over them. After Care Work.‚ÄîThis work is in the hands of a Borough Care Committee consisting of members of the Borough Council, representatives from the County Council, Public Health Department of the Borough Council, and man)' organisations connected with the relief of distress in the area, together with several members personally interested in the work. In order to deal with assessments as to the amount of payment to be made by a non-insured person recommended for institutional treatment, two sub-committees have been formed, one for Clapham, Balham, Tooting and Streatham, and one for Putney and Wandsworth. The sub-committees also deal with routine reports and similar matters in connection with the institutional treatment of patients. The main committee deals with matters of policy, cases of difficulty arising at the sub-committees, with the question of employment, and other matters arising from time to time. During the year 408 cases have been dealt with by the committee. 45 have received material help, e.g., treatment at Convalescent Homes, gifts of books and clothing, or the loan of nursing appliances. 80 bedridden cases have been periodicallyvisited by members of the committee, and helped in many ways. With permission of the Board of Guardians, two members of the committee make routine visits to dispensary patients under treatment at St. John's Hill and St. James's Infirmaries. 67 visits have been made at the request of hospitals, and 169 reports have been sent to the London Insurance Committee. The greatest difficulty has been experienced in finding suit able employment for those who are well enough to do some work. No local arrangements exist for this purpose, beyond the individual exertions of the Secretaries, and the insertion of Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 93 an advertisement, free of charge, in the " Borough News," through the kindness of the Editor. 17 patients have been found work by these means. Results of Treatment.‚ÄîThe investigation into this matter has been systematically carried out during the last two years and I am able to give a short outline of the results obtained in those patients who attended for examination in the six years‚Äî 1913 to 1918. All the records have been examined and attempts have been made to trace all patients in whom the diagnosis of Tuberculosis was made, with a view to determining the state of their health at the end of 1919. Many were still attending at that time and an accurate estimate can be made of their condition. Others, known to be alive, are unable to attend for some reason or another, and their progress has to be determined from the information given to the nurses when making their routine visits. " Well and at work " is a common report to receive, and such a case is entered as stationary unless a recent examination has disclosed a different state of affairs. Many have removed and cannot be traced at all. With regard to classification, all patients have been placed into one or other of three groups :‚Äî (1) Definite cases of Tuberculosis. (2) Cases where the disease was suspected but not definite. (3) Cases where there was no evidence of Tuberculosis. The definite cases have been further divided into pulmonary and non-pulmonary, active and inactive. The classification of inactive disease is only made where there is evidence on examination that the disease has been present, at some time or other. A suspicious history by itself, is not considered sufficient to warrant the diagnosis of even inactive disease. It is comparatively common to find evidence of 94 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. inactive disease in the lungs in a person who appears to be well, and sometimes it is found in some other part of the body. When there is active disease in the lungs, in addition to disease in some other part of the body, the case is classified as pulmonary. Table LII. shows all the cases who attended the dispensaries during the years 1913 to 1918 classified in the way just described. TABLE LII. New Cases, 1913 to 1918, Classified according to Diagnosis.

Most of these patients remain in a stationary condition and the disease can generally be regarded as permanently arrested, and incapable of further improvement. The patients are no danger to others and are usually fit to earn their own living. The two deaths which occurred were not due to Tuberculosis (see footnote to Table). As already stated, the earlier years of treatment are the critical years, so that a study of results after, say, three years' treatment, might be expected to give useful information. Bearing this in mind, and with the further object of obtaining as large figures as possible, it was decided to classify the results according to the condition at the end of the third calendar year of treatment, and so make the cases of one year comparable with those of another year. The 1913 cases were taken on their condition at the end of 1915, the 1914 cases on their condition 97 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. at the end of 1916, and so on. Calculated in this way, the average duration of treatment for each patient is 2| years. Patients attending in the five years 1913 to 1917 can all be brought in by the end of 1919, those of 1918 will not have completed the same period of treatment till the end of 1920, and have been left out, as the investigation has not been carried beyond 1919.

(3) Between ages of five and 25, more females are affected than males, while the reverse holds good in the higher age groups. Table LVI. gives the condition of the same patients at the end of the third year of treatment, showing, firstly, the results in all cases, whatever treatment they received, and secondly, the results in those of them who received Sanatorium and Tuberculin treatment. The numbers who received Tuberculin treatment appear to be too small to< subdivide according to the results of the sputum examination. TABLE LVI. Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis.

For instance, for all cases male, the nett total is obtained by deducting 139 untraced from 656 total, giving 517 nett cases; 296 of these have died, a percentage of 57. TABLE LV1I.

The group, "no record of sputum," contains many very bad cases, generally seen only once, where no opportunity of examining the sputum has occurred. Most of them are probably sputum positive and the high case mortality is due to these two factors. In both sexes there is a slightly smaller case mortality among patients. who have received Sanatorium or Tuberculin 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. treatment, than for all cases treated. It is necessary, however, to remember that a considerable amount of selection is exercised in determining the suitable cases for either of these forms of treatment, and the worst cases are not chosen. It Sanatorium and Tuberculin treatment were of real benefit to patients of the dispensary class, one would expect that the figures would compare more favourably with those for all cases than they do. As they stand, the results are disappointing, except perhaps, for females treated with Tuberculin, but here the numbers dealt with are really too small to form any definite conclusion. Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis.‚ÄîDuring the six years 1913 to 1918, 311 patients were classified as suffering from Tuberculosis of some part of the body other than the lungs; in 218 the disease was active at the initial examination, and in 63 it was inactive. The condition of these patients at the end of 1919 is shown in Table LVIII. The site of the lesion is shown for the active cases, but not for the inactive ones, and the results of institutional and Tuberculin treatment for all forms are shown at the bottom of the table. The sexes have not been separated. TABLE LVIIl. Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Condition at end, of 1919. Removed. Dead. Advanced. Stationary. Improved. Cured.

As one expects, the results are better than for Pulmonary Tuberculosis, an appreciable number of patients being completely cured. The distinction between inactive disease and cure is an indefinite one, but, as a general rule, if the disease has been inactive for three years or more, the case is classified as cured. Suspected Tuberculosis.‚ÄîAs shown in Table LII., during the six years, 56 patients were classified as suspected cases of Tuberculosis : 26 of them were males and 30 females; in 54 cases the suspicious lesion was pulmonary, in two it was nonpulmonary. Many of these were treated for considerable periods, but the diagnosis was not definitely cleared up, and at the end of 1919 their condition was as follows:‚Äî Removed, 22. Improved, 15.

These children were being treated at the London County Council cleansing stations. In 57 cases where consent was obtained, disinfection of the bedding and clothing of the patient was carried out by the disinfecting staff. In addition to the above 89 other cases in adults and four children were reported to me. These cases were treated at the baths at the Council's disinfecting station with sulphurated potash baths, and in every case the disease was cured. The average number of baths given per case was three. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. I.‚ÄîWork of Health Visitors The duties of the Health Visitors include the visiting of infants under the Notification of Births Act, and of children between the ages of one and five years, of all cases of measles, whooping-cough, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and tuberculosis in children under five years of age, and all cases of ophthalmia neonatorum and puerperal fever, the investigation into deaths of infants under one year, attendance and lectures at infant welfare and ante-natal centres, the visiting of creches, and committee meetings in connection therewith, investigation into applications for milk under the Milk (Mothers and Children) Order, the provision of free meals and dental treatment, the periodical visiting of homes for unmarried mothers and children, the keeping of registers and records in connection with the above, and the preparation of monthly reports. Since the opening of the Maternity Home the Health Visitors also investigate the home conditions of patients applying for admission to the Home, and also, in some instances, the financial circumstances. 105 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the total number of births, viz., 7,212, 5,211, or 72.2 per cent. were visited, compared with 64.4 per cent. in 1919.

Infant Visiting. The total number of visits and re-visits was 8,829, of which 5,211 were first visits, compared with 3,506 in the previous year. The re-visits numbered 3,618 as against 4,178. The decrease in re-visits is due to the fact that so many more mothers attended the Infant Welfare Centres, and also the free distribution of milk under the Milk (Mothers and Children) Order entailed a great amount of work, not only in visiting, but particularly in clerical work. 3,087 visits were paid in respect of milk as against 1,797 last year. At the first visit 4,141 were entirely breast-fed, 427 were breast-fed supplemented by artificial feeding, and the remainder were entirely bottle fed. In two cases rabbits brains were being given to infants under the age of a month. On re-visiting 1,712 were found to be entirely breast-fed, 659 were breast-fed supplemented by artificial feeding, and the remainder were otherwise fed. 134 of the infants visited died during the year (33 in Clapham, 11 in Putney, 19 in Balham, 12 in Streatham, 23 in Tooting, 24 in Wandsworth I., and 12 in Wandsworth II). As shown by the Table, the highest mortality occurred during the first four months of life, four died under one month, and 56 died before reaching the age of five months. 157 of the infants visited were prematurely born, and 157 were delicate from birth, 80 twin births were visited, of whom 12 died, and two mothers had triplets, and of these in one case all the children are alive and well, and in the other, in which the infants were premature, two died shortly after birth, and one lived seven months and died of convulsions. With regard to the employment of midwives, 2,191 mothers had employed their services, 463 infants were born in hospital and other institutions, and one unregistered woman was employed. In 2,556 births doctors have been in attendance. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 107 149 children between the ages of one and two years were visited and 728 were re-visited. 298 children between the ages of two and five years were visited, and 1,620 were re-visited. The small number of first visits to children between the ages of one to two', and two to five years, is due to the fact that most of them had been already visited as infants. The 149 children under two years of age, and 298 between the ages of two to five years were children who had been born elsewhere, and so not previously known and visited. Six orphan children under the care of guardians were referred to me by the London War Pensions Committee for supervision. In each case the child was found to be well cared for and the home conditions satisfactory. The ante-natal work has developed during the last year owing to the Welfare Centres having ante-natal sessions apart from the Infant Clinics. The visits totalled 206 as against 83 in 1919. The sanitary defects found in the houses during visits to the mothers were all dealt with in the usual way. Cases in which defects were found were referred to me by the Health Visitors, and, in addition, 53 intimation notices and three statutory notices were served by the two Health Visitors, who are also Sanitary Inspectors.

The supervision of midwives is under the control of the London County Council, but there is full co-operation between the midwives and the Health Visitors. There are 31 midwives practising in the Borough, of whom eight reside in neighbouring districts. Nurses. Arrangements have been made with various nursing associations in the Borough to attend cases of ophthalmia neonatorum, measles, whooping-cough, diarrhoea, and pneumonia following influenza, measles or whooping-cough, when and as requested by the Medical Officer of Health at a fee of 1/3 per visit. 3,332 such visits were paid during the year. Clapham is served by the South London District Nursing Association; Putney and Roehampton by the nurses appointed by the Parochial Nursing Associations; and Streatham, Tooting, Wandsworth, and Balham, by Ranyard Nurses, of whom there are 13 working in the Borough. The northern district of Streatham is served by the Brixton Nursing Association. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 109 Consultation and Treatment Centres. As no treatment is given at the various Infant Welfare Centres, children are sent to suitable hospitals or to private doctors. The principal diseases found were affections of the eyes, ears, throat or skin, advanced cases of rickets and the like. Maternity Homes. There are 38 private maternitv homes in the Borough, four of which are carried on by practising midwives. During the greater part of the year expectant mothers were sent either to the Clapham Maternity Hosptal or to any similar institution where there is accommodation, the Council defraying the cost of ¬£2 per week up to ¬£6. Patients so sent were asked to pay 30s. the amount of the maternity benefit under the National Insurance Act, but in cases of extreme necessity this payment was remitted. Eleven mothers were sent to maternity homes during the year. The new Maternity Home, situated at Park Hill, Beechcroft Road, Upper Tooting, was opened by the Mayoress, Mrs. Cooper Rawson, on the 4th November, 1920. The building was purchased as a Borough War Memorial, the amount required being raised by voluntary subscription. It is maintained by the Borough Council, and is under the direct control of the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee. The Medical Officer of Health, and under him the matron, is responsible for the administrative control, subject to the supervision of a Home Committee appointed by the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee. The premises are most suitable for the purpose and after certain alterations had been carried out, accommodation for 23 beds was provided. The details of furnishing and equipment were worked our with some care, and every appliance deemed necessary has been provided. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Council has appointed as matron, Miss E. Waring, who had previous experience as matron of the Maternity Home at Ilford. The staff when complete will consist, in addition to the matron, of two sisters, two staff nurses, and six probationers, with one outdoor nurse for district work. Up to the end of the year five cases had been admitted, and it is hoped that the whole of the beds will be fully occupied early in 1921. Hospitals and other Institutions for Expectant and Nursing Mothers, and Young Children, as In-patients. The Streatham Babies' Hospital is the only institution of the kind in the Borough, and infants from any part of the Borough are admitted. The accommodation consists of 20 cots, including two isolation cots. The staff consists of a visiting Medical Officer, matron, sister, two staff nurses (day and night) and three probationers. There is also one domestic servant. The minimum charge is 10s. 6d. per week. No child is admitted free except in cases of extreme poverty. Seventy-nine infants passed through the hospital during the year, the average stay being six weeks. The complaints from which they sufferedl were marasmus (-35), dyspepsia, gastro-enteritis, rickets, pneumonia, bronchitis, debility, tubercular glands, pyloric stenosis, infantile paralysis, and talipes. Nine of the cases proved fatal, chiefly from marasmus. There are three institutions in the Borough for the reception of expectant unmarried mothers, all in connection with rescue work. The mothers are received a few months prior to the confinement, and are expected to remain, in one instance at least six months after; in the other two the average stay is three months after confinement. In one home the mothers, if able, do the domestic work of the house, and are therefore with their Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 111 babies all clay. 50 mothers with their babies were received during the year. In another, where the mothers learn glove making in the Home, only 14 mothers were received during the year, the Home being closed from June to November. In the third, 170 mothers passed through the Home during the year, the number of births being 156. One hostel, also in connection with rescue work, does not receive pre-maternity cases, but makes arrangements for the confinement. The mother is expected to remain 12 months‚Äîshe has three months' training in the Home in domestic work, and then goes out to daily work. 13 mothers and 13 babies were received during the year. One of the above Homes had a separate hostel for the children‚Äîfour children were inmates of this hostel on Januarv 1st, 1920‚Äîone was admitted later, and died after two days. The hostel was closed finally on September 1st, 1920, owing to lack of funds. In all the above hostels arrangements have been made for a medical man to attend when necessary. Some of the infants attend at the most convenient Infant Welfare Centre. StilBirths. Investigations were made into the cases of 69 still-births, 20 of which were premature and 15 were difficult labours, 36 were delivered by midwives, 10 occurred in institutions, and 23 were doctors' cases. Advice was given as to the care of the health of the mother, and in the event of her again becoming pregnant she was invited to attend the Ante-natal Clinic. Convalescent Homes. During the year six mothers and five children were sent to Convalescent Homes. Five of the mothers and three of the children were sent to Ashburton Home, Addiscombe, and the others to various places. 112 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Illegitimate Births. It has hitherto been difficult to ascertain the number of unmarried mothers and illegitimate children in the Borough, as a certain proportion of the illegitimate births occurred outside the district. During the past year, however, particulars of all births belonging to> this Borough which occurred in other districts have been sent monthly by the Registrar-General. Of the 223 illegitimate births belonging to the Borough 135 have been visited, 24 were above the standard of visiting, 34 had removed before visit, four were born in the workhouse and remained there, five died before visit, 14 were boarded out under the London County Council, five wrong addresses were given, and in two cases repeated ineffectual visits were made. Of the 135 visited 11 died. In the majority of cases no assistance was required, as arrangements had been made for the care of the children. Maternity and Child Welfare Centres. There are now seven Infant Welfare Centres in the Borough and it is hoped shortly to open an eighth to serve the Fairfield Ward of Wandsworth. The mothers from this district at present attend the Centre held at the Anchor Mission in Garratt Lane. The premises occupied by the Balham and Springfield Infant Welfare Centres are quite inadequate to accommodate the increasing number of mothers who wish to avail themselves of the advice and help provided. It is hoped shortly to find more suitable premises for the two Centres thus handicapped. Each Centre has a medical officer and a trained superintendent ; but all the work connected with the keeping of records, the purchase and sale of food and drugs, and of clothing, is done by voluntary workers, who are most regular and efficient. Infants and children up to five years of age are admitted. They are weighed at every attendance, seen by the doctor when necessary, and reports concerning their progress are recorded. The superintendent visits the homes of the children to see that the doctor's instructions are carried out. No visiting by untrained workers is allowed, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 113 Each Centre, with the exception of Putney, has a separate session for ante-natal work‚Äîat Putney it is held concurrently with the Infant Clinic. The accompanying- Table summarises the work done at all Centres. The total number on the registers at the end of 1920 was 8,492 ; there were 2,860 new cases registered during the year, the total number of attendances was 29,450, 32 were transferred to the other Centres, 165 removed, 261 were passed on to the London County Council, and 73 died. The total number of ante-natal cases on the registers at the end of 1920 was 512, the attendances numbering 826. The superintendents visits to infants totalled 9,486, and to ante-natal cases 785. 159 health talks were given. In Putney a course of needlework classes was given during the autumn, and a special lecture to the mothers of the Putney, Wandsworth, and Southfields Centres was given in the summer by Miss Pearson, C.M.B. In Tooting needlework classes are held concurrently with the ante-natal session. In Southfields a course of eight lectures on Hygiene was given by the medical officer of the Centre. In Wandsworth a course of six lectures on home nursing was given, and 16 sewing classes were held. A baby show and exhibition were held at the Tooting Infant Welfare Centre in October, 1920. Only those mothers who attended regularly were allowed to enter their infants. Preliminary marks were given under the heading of mothercraft, thus enabling babies who had a bad start in life, but whose mothers by their care had lessened their handicap, to compete fairly with strong and healthy born children ; some of these delicate children took prizes. In Classes I. and II. (children under nine months) all the prize-winners were entirely breast-fed. In class III. (children up to two years) and class IV. (children between two and five years of age) 76 and 75 per cent. respectively had been Ji 114 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. breast-fed up to nine months. In the " twin class " 50 per cent. had been breast-fed. The mothers also competed for prizes in needlework and toy making. During the three days the exhibition was open special lectures were given on " The Care of the Teeth " and on "Tuberculosis in Infants." 516 attendances were made by the Health Visitors to the Infant Clinics, and 151 to the Ante-natal Clinics. One of the Health Visitors is a member of the local committee of each Infant Welfare Centre, and the Medical Officer of Health is ex-officio a member of the General Council, whose function is to co-ordinate the work of the Centres. 119 health talks were given by the Health Visitors during the year, and the following is a list of the most important subjects dealt with :‚Äî 1. Advantages of the ante-natal clinic. 2. Ante-natal hygiene. 3. Breast-feeding., 4. Bronchitis and Pneumonia. 5. Baby Show‚ÄîClasses. Characteristics for prize-winners. 6. Choice of foods. 7. Clothing of infants and young children. 8. Co-operation‚Äîits meaning in trade, school, life, and how it should apply to Infant Welfare work. 9. Danger of dummies. 10.

Creches. There are four creches in the Borough‚ÄîPutney, Balham, Tooting and Wandsworth. Children are admitted whose mothers are obliged to go out to work, or who are ill, or who for any other reasonable cause are unable to look after their children. The creches are voluntary institutions subsidised by grants from the Borough Council and the Board of Education. The parents' payments vary from 8d. to 1s. per head, a reduction being made when more than one child from the same family is admitted. The Wandsworth Day Nursery is also a training school for nurses who intend to take up creche work. They are admitted as probationers and serve a term of six months, receiving not only practical training but also theoretical. The matron gives courses of lectures which the probationers are bound to attend, and an examination is held at the end of the course. 124 inspections of the creches were made during the year by the Health Visitors, who represent the Medical Officer of Health on the Committees. The attendances were: in Putney, 10,114; in Balham, 5,665; in Tooting, 5,163; and in Wandsworth, 5,984; a total of 26,926, an increase of 5,394 compared with 1919. Dental Treatment. In May, 1919, the arrangements made by the Council with the British Dentists' Hospital, Clapham Common, came into force. 84 cases (71 women and 13 children) availed themselves of the opportunity to have dental tent, and 124 attendances (107 women and 17 children) were made. 14 women had1 dentures, the charge varying from 50/- for a few teeth up to ¬£4 10s. for a full set; the charge is according to the number of teeth inserted. The medical officer at each Infant Welfare Centre examines carefully the teeth of the mothers and children, and recommends treatment when necessary. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 117 Puerperal Fever. There were 36 cases of puerperal fever notified (nine in Clapham, five in Putney, nine in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 11 in Wandsworth). Five were midwives' cases, one was a miscarriage, one a concealment of birth, in six instances the child was still-born, five were born before the doctor or midwife arrived, 13 patients were removed to hospitals and 16 to St. James's Infirmary, and five cases occurred in nursing homes. Eight of the cases proved fatal. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 60 cases were notified, of which 19 were in Clapham, four in Putney, 11 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 21 in Wandsworth. All the cases were visited. 30 were attended at birth by midwives, and seven cases occurred in maternity homes (two in Clapham, one in Putney, two in Streatham and two in Tooting). 26 cases were treated in hospital as out-patients, 11 as inpatients, and the remainder were treated. at home. Three cases removed from the district before recovery, and one died. In three instances the sight has been impaired. 24 cases were notified by midwives. In 25 cases the district nurse was asked to attend, and 1,844 visits were made. 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXV1. Ophthalmia Neonatorum, 1920. NO. Date of notification.

The services of the district nurses were requisitioned in 45 cases (16 in Clapham, five in Putney, 12 in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 10 in Wandsworth), where bronchitis or pneumonia had set in. The nurses' visits totalled 503. Whooping Cough. 356 visits and 21 re-visits were made by the Health Visitors in cases of whoopnig cough. In 12 cases (five in Clapham, five in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth), district nurses were called in, and their visits numbered1 129. Epidemic Diarrhoea.

Statement of Work done under the Rag Flock Act, 1911. 17 workshops were visited by the inspector and the materials used for bedding and upholstery were examined. 36 samples were procured and submitted for analysis. All these were reported as complying with the standard of cleanliness required. 125 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. ANNUAL STATEMENT Of the work done in the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth under the Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts, summarised from the Quarterly Reports. To the Mayor Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Herewith we beg to submit to you our report of the work performed by us under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts during the year 1920. This report is signed by us jointly owing to the fact that your Additional Public Analyst was left in sole charge during the absence, from August to December, of your Public Analyst owing to illness. During the year, 1,867 samples were received and duly reported upon. Of these samples, 872 were submitted formally, whilst 995 were informal. 109 samples in all were reported against, being 5.7 per cent. of those examined. Of the formal samples 67, or 7.5 per cent., were returned as adulterated, whilst 42, or 4.2 per cent. of the informal samples, were found unsatisfactory. Below we give a statement showing the nature of the samples submitted, together with the number of each variety reported1 against. In separate tables the nature cf the Drugs, "Other Articles," and Milk and Cream examined, with any adulteration reported, are given. 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. General Statement.

Milk and Cream. 1 he samples grouped under the heading " Milk and Cream" were comprised as follows :‚Äî Nature of Sample. Examined. Adulterated. Formal. Informal. Total. Formal. Informal. Total. Milk 797 19 816 55 6 61 Hot Milk 12 ... 12 2 ... 2 Separated Milk 56 ... 56 5 ... 5 Condensed Milk ... 2 2 ... 0 0 Cream, fresh ... 41 41 ... 1 1 Cream, preserved ... 33 33 ... 3 3 Total 865 95 960 62 10 72 Thus, the amount of adulteration reported in the case of the Milk and Cream samples submitted was, for formal samples, 7.0 per cent. ; for informal samples, 10.5 per cent. ; and for all samples, 7.4 per cent. Butter. Of the 632 samples of Butter submitted, two only were formal samples, and both of these were reported against, as under : Case No. Nature of Report. 2 44 20 per cent. Margarine. 428 44 per cent. Margarine. In the case of the 6.30 informal samples of butter, 18, or 2.8 per cent., were reported against. Of these, 16 were found to contain margarine, and two excess of boron preservative, Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 129 Margarine. I he two formal samples of margarine submitted were both reported against as under :‚Äî Case No. Nature of Report. 245 80 per cent. Butter. 246 80 per cent. Butter. Both the above samples were taken in connection with butter sample No. 244, which, as previously shown, contained 20 per cent. margarine. All the samples of margarine submitted contained a boron preservative, in quantities of 0.5 per cent, or under, calculated as crystallised Boric Acid, H3BO3. Of the 53 informal samples of coffee submitted, one, or 1.9 per cent., was found to contain chicory. Only one formal sample of drugs was submitted, and this was reported against, as under :‚Äî Case No. Nature of Article. Nature of Report. 621 Purified Borax. 25 parts of Arsenic per million. Of the 34 samples of drug's submitted informally, four, or 11.8 per cent., were reported against. Of these, one sample of Rochelle salts was found to consist of carbonate of potash; whilst two samples of acid calcium phosphate, and a purified borax were reported against as containing excess of arsenic. Under the heading "Other Articles," two informal samples of baking powder were reported against as containing excess of arsenic; whilst two samples of canned peas‚Äîalso informal‚Äîwere returned as unsatisfactory inasmuch as they were found to contain sulphate of copper. 130 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In conclusion, we think it a matter of congratulation to the Borough that the percentage of adulteration for all samples continues low. In this connection it should be noted that, were it not for a regulation of the Milk Order (1920) forbidding the colouring of milk, the percentage adulteration of the formal samples would have been appreciably lower than the figure reported : namely, 7.5 per cent. In previous years the presence of a trace of colouring in milk would not, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, have been deemed an adulteration ; and in comparing the annual returns, this fact must be taken into consideration. Exclusive of these coloured milks, the percentage adulteration for all formal samples would have been 6.2 per cent. We are, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, A. H. M. MUTER, f.i.c., Public Analyst. CHARLES A. HACKMAN, f.i.c., Additional Public Analyst. The Laboratories, 325, Kennington Road, S.E. 11. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 131 Revenue Act. During; the year two certificates were granted under the above Act, and one was refused. The certificates granted referred to two houses or six tenements. Cleansing of Persons Act. The names of 74 children, nine belonging to Clapham, four to Putney, 16 to Streatham, 21 to Tooting, and 24 to Wandsworth, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In 42 cases the body and clothing were stated to be also verminous. These children were cleansed by the officials of the London County Council at the Cleansing Station under the supervision of that Authority. 90 adults had baths on account of their verminous condition, 89 of these being cases of scabies. Cutting=off Notices. During the year, 86 notices with respect to 95 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 14 of the premises were in Clapham, 25 in Putney, 21 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 27 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 43 premises, from 25 premises in consequence of defects, in 23 the premises were empty, and in four cases by request. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. HOUSING. I‚ÄîGENERAL HOUSING CONDITIONS IN THE DISTRICT. (1) The general housing conditions in this Borough are fairly satisfactory. The congestion which existed has been to some extent lessened by the erection of new houses, the conversion of houses into flats, and to the removal of families from the Borough to other parts of London and to the provinces. (2) (a) Extent of shortage of house's.‚ÄîThe average number of houses for the working classes built during the years 1909, 1910, and 1911, was 600, and this number seems to express fairly accurately the normal requirements of the Borough. From 1912 to 1919 the average number erected was only 150, a difference of '50, so that if building during the last nine years had been at the same rate as in the previous four years there would have been 4,050 more houses erected. If from this 4,050 there is deducted the total number of empty houses at the census of 1911, viz., 2,600, and the number erected and occupied during 1920, this would give 1,308 as the extent of shortage of houses, provided the population increased at the same rate as in the previous decennial period. (b) Measures taken or contemplated to meet any shortage.‚Äî The number of houses erected by the Council and occupied during 1920 was 64, and erected by private builders 44, a total of 108. In addition the Council has converted nine houses into 34 flats. There are also at present 512 houses in course of erection by the Council and 10 by private builders. Lay-out plans have now been approved for the erection of 1,143 houses on the following sites :‚Äî Magdalen Park. Watney Estate. Furzedown Estate. Elmwood Estate. (3) No important change has taken place in the population during the year, and none is anticipated in the future. 132 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. II.‚ÄîOVERCROWDING. (1) Extent.‚ÄîThe total number of cases of overcrowding dealt with in 1920 was 42. This is somewhat above the average of former years. The standard used for determining these cases of overcrowding was 400 cubic feet for adults and 200 cubic feet for children under 10 years of age. (2) Causes.-‚ÄîThe greater number of cases was due to domestic overcrowding, the number of rooms available for sleeping purposes being too few for the size of the family. A certain number of cases was due to sub-letting. At the census of 1911 the percentage of population in private families living more than two in a room was 6.3, compared with 17.8 in the Metropolis as a whole, the only Borough in London having a lower percentage being Lewisham, where it was 3.9. (3) Measures taken or contemplated to deal with overcrowding.‚ÄîThe Council has prepared schemes for the erection of 1,143 houses, and this will to a large extent relieve the congestion which exists in some parts of the Borough, and the London County Council contemplate the erection of 1,186 houses on the Dover House Estate, Roehampton. (4) Principal cases of overcrowding during the year and action taken.‚ÄîNotices under the Public Health Act were served in each case, and in nearly all the cases the overcrowding was abated by the re-arrangement of the sleeping accommodation. III.‚ÄîFITNESS OF HOUSES. (1) (a) General standard of housing in the district.‚ÄîIn 1881 the total number of inhabited houses in the Borough was 15,300, whilst in 1920 the estimated number was 56,539, an increase of 41,239. As 70 per cent. of the houses have been erected during the last 30 years the standard of housing is comparatively high. There are, however, approximately 2,000 houses in the Borough which fall below a reasonable standard, and these are chieflv old houses where the rooms are small. There are in addition about 133 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1,600 houses which, although built for one family and which, if occupied by one family, would be quite satisfactory, are unsatisfactory when occupied by two families, owing to the absence or inadequate provision of sinks, larders and means of cooking and domestic washing. (b) General character of the defects found to exist in unfit houses.‚ÄîDamp conditions due to defective roofs, guttering, and absence of damp proof courses. Defective flooring, dry rot, absence of sinks and coppers for domestic washing, absence of larders, defective windows, frames and sills, defective internal walls and ceilings due to age, and defective lighting and ventilation of staircases. There were few cases where the drains were defective, and only minor defects in water closets were found. (c) How far defects are due to the lack of proper management and supervision by owners.‚ÄîAs a general rule properties in this Borough are well managed or supervised by the owners or agents. There are a few properties, however, which from various reasons have not been properly supervised, but when the attention of the owners was called to the matter by the service of notice the work to remedy the nuisance was as a rule put in hand in a reasonable time, considering the high cost of labour and materials. The defects generally found were due to fair wear and tear, but in some exceptional cases the tenants were responsible for some of the nuisances discovered, and in these cases notice was served upon the tenant. During the year 23,880 houses were inspected and 9,121 notices were served, 7,997 of which were complied with. (2) Action taken as regards unfit houses under (a) the Public Health Acts, (b) the Housing Acts. (a) Notices served under Section 2, and if these were not complied with in a reasonable time, statutory notices were served. (b) Five closing orders were made during the year for five vans in Wardley Street. Notices were served under Section 28 134 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1919, in the case of 14 premises, one of the houses was repaired by the Council, and the others are being dealt with by the freeholders, and made reasonably fit for human habitation. (3) Difficulties in remedying unfitness, special measures taken, and any suggestions in the matters.‚ÄîWant and high cost of labour and materials were the chief difficulties experienced. Another difficulty was that to render the houses fit it would have been necessary for the tenants to vacate the premises, and as no other accommodation was available the work could not be proceeded with. (4) Conditions, so far as they affect housing, as regards water supply, closet accommodation, and refuse disposal.‚ÄîThe water supply was in all cases satisfactory, the Metropolitan Water Board's supply being used in all houses in the Borough. Cisterns, where they are present, are generally kept in a clean condition. Closet accommodation.‚ÄîGenerally, this is satisfactory, although in some houses now let in tenements the number of closets might with advantage be increased. In a few cases in old property there is one closet to two houses, but unless there is a definite nuisance it was not considered necessary to' serve notice for an additional water closet to be provided. Refuse disposal. Metal dust bins are now universal. The house refuse is removed by contractors once a week. Particulars as to removal of house refuse are given on page 31 of this Report. It was not necessary to take any special measures during the year as regards these conditions. Instances of nuisances under these headings were dealt with as occasion arose by service of notices under the Public Health (London) Act. 135 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. IV.‚ÄîUNHEALTHY AREAS. No action has been taken, as there are no unhealthy areas in the Borough. V.‚ÄîBY-LAWS RELATING' TO HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, AND TO TENTS, VANS, SHEDS, ETC. (1) Working of existing By-laws.‚ÄîThere are 292 registered houses let in lodgings in the Borough, and these are inspected yearly. Greater difficulty has been experienced in getting the cleansing carried out owing to the want of labour and materials, otherwise the By-laws have worked satisfactorily. The five occupied vans in the Borough which come under the By-laws were found to be in such an insanitary condition that the matter was reported to the Housing Committee, who made Closing Orders. (2) .45 to need for new By-laws or revision of existing Bylaws.‚ÄîNew By-laws are being drafted by the 'London County Council to be carried out by the Borough Councils. VI.‚Äî GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS. At page 32 of the general report will be found particulars of the work done by the sanitary inspectors during the year in connection with housing, the number of inspections made, the number of notices served, and the nuisances found at these inspections. 137 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.
