Telephone No. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Elmbridge 6441 - Ext.25. 2, SHALSTON VILLAS, SURBITON. June, 1964. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report 1963. Mr. Mayor, .Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1963. The report is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/64 dated 13th January, 1964, and follows the general lines as for previous reports. The health of Surbiton still remains very satisfactory and there has been no serious outbreak of any particular disease. Population: The Registrar General's estimate mid-1963 population figure is given as 63,450 an increase of 280. The vital statistics in this report are based on this figure. Infectious diseases; A table showing the incidence of infectious diseases during the past ten years will be found on page 11. The number of notifications in respect of infectious disease received in 1963 was 857 compared with 102 for 1962. This increase is largely due to the periodic increase of measles notifications which were 715 for the year. A marked increase in cases of dysentery and Whooping Cough will be seen compared with the previous year. Once again I am pleased to comment upon the number of cases remaining on the Tuberculosis register at the end of year. This figure is now reduced to 208, and it will be seen from the Table on page 18 how the decrease has occurred over the past nine years. There were no cases of Diphtheria or Poliomyelitis occurring in the Borough during 1963 and with constant active immunisation this trend should continue. Two cases of Meningitis were notified, one an elderly female aged 76 ( Pneumococcal) and one an infant of 8 months, a Meningococcal infection. The Typhoid fever case reported was an infection caught abroad and developed on return from holiday. No further cases spread from it. 2. Births: The statistics supplied "by the Registrar-General show that during 1963 the total number of registered live births belonging to Surbiton was 1,011 (531 males, 480 females). This gives a Birth Rate of 15.93 per 1,000 of the population compared with 15.46 for the previous year. There was an increase of 11 illegitimate births compared with 1962, the figure for 1963 being 60, comprising 30 males and 30 females. This represents 5.93 per cent of the total live births. There is a continual increase in the number of births taking place annually, and a continuous rise in the total population. There is every indication of this natural increase continuing. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1963 is 763 compared with 654 for 1962. This gives a death rate of 12.02 per thousand of the population compared with 10.35 for 1962. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1963 is 14 giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 13.84 compared with a rate of 17.4 for 1962, The causes of death of these infants will he seen on page 6. Causes of death: The main causes of death during 1963 were:- Heart and circulatory disease 139 Cancer 150 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 92 In view of the importance of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer the relevant figures for Surbiton residents are given below:- 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 M F M F M F M F M F M F Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus 26 3 22 4 34 1 24 5 20 10 31 9 Total 29 26 35 29 30 40 Posters of varying design carrying messages of warning against smoking were exhibited throughout the Borough during the year. 3. Housing: No slackening off in the provision of housing can "be indulged in as the demand is ever increasing. The overall need for increased housing provision still persists and special attention to the needs of young people getting married is urgent. They are having to pay an excessive proportion of their weekly income to obtain homes which are sometimes scandalously inadequate. More and more old people require carefully designed buildings where they can live under a certain amount of supervision. The trend previously noted of demolition of family houses and replacement by blocks of flats and maisonettes continues. All efforts to conserve open space and land must be made by allowing taller buildings for dwellings in the residential areas, and increasing densities judiciously. Vital Statistics: The vital statistics are favourable, maintaining the satisfactory trend of recent years, and upholding the fact that Surbiton is a good place in which to live and work, and the health services are proving effective. Staff: Details of the staff of the Public Health Department are set out on page 1. Mr. E.C. Reeve, the Rodent Officer retired on the 5th July 1963, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining a substitute was re-engaged in a temporary part-time capacity. A temporary part-time clerk was also appointed and this arrangement has worked quite well. I am pleased again to record my thanks to the Chairman and Vice-chairman, and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year, and to Mr. Eldridge, the Chief Public Health Inspector and his Inspectors, Mr. Elms and the clerical staff and to Dr. w, Kinstrie, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STARKEY. Medical Officer of Health. 4. GENERAL STATISTICS.

Surbiton is an attractive well favoured residential town with many recreation grounds and open spaces. It flanks the river and is close to Epsom Downs, two Royal Parks and Hampton Court Palace. Its population is healthy and it enjoys many physical and social amenities. It is mainly a dormitory town but many of the people are engaged in local industry which comprises a variety of trades in modern factories. There are good shopping centres and exceptionally good communications by road and rail. 5. VITAL STATISTICS.

It will be seen that there were more than 6,000 persons over 65 years of age in this population table in 1951 and the figure is no doubt higher today. The presence of so many in the older age groups means the necessity to co-ordinate, organise and maintain more comprehensive geriatric services and special housing for the old folk.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Exclusion from work of Contacts of Infectious Disease. By regulations made under the National Insurance Act, 1946 and the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1953, persons may be excluded from work and entitled to National Health sickness benefit if, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, such persons are contacts or carriers of disease and it is necessary to exclude them from work in order to prevent the spread of infection. These Regulations apply particularly to food handlers in foodshops, also cooks, and kitchen hands employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year two such certificates were issued. DIPHTHERIA. The Borough has now been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation services offered, there is no reason why the disease should not remain entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Administrative work on immunisation is conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria, whooping cough and other immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisation carried out in the course of his practice; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from Grange Road Health Centre, Kingston upon Thames. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Monday mornings at 1, Gosbury Hill, 9.30 to 11 o'clock. Chessington. Telephone: Lower Hook 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings at Swell Road, Surbiton. 11 o'clock. Telephone: Elmbridge 4897. (or Diphtheria Immunisation may be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). 13. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1963. Reinforcement doses during 1963 Age under 1 year 422 - Age 1 year to 4 years 420 280 Age 5 years to 14 years 5 675 The following table sets out the number of children immunised in each of the last seven years:- Year Primary Immunisations Reinforcements 1957 691 1,399 1958 799 1,162 1959 859 1,267 1960 956 1,002 1961 1,064 2,280 1962 793 918 1963 847 955 SMALLPOX. Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat. There is very close liaison between local authorities and the sea and air ports, and contacts of this disease are kept under strict observation wherever they may be during the maximum incubation period of 16 days. The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1963 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over TOTAL Vaccinations 75 64 7 3 10 159 Re-vaccinations - - 3 13 11 27 The Standing Medical Advisory Committee now advise that smallpox vaccination should be offered to children during the first two years of life, but preferably during the second year. 14. .

Several schools were involved and there was no concentration to indicate an explosive outbreak. The usual control measures were obviously effective. The following table shows the number of cases occurring since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton in 1951:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 62 - 10 12 25 289 202 28 123 2 - 12 76 POLIOMYELITIS The figures since 1950 are given below:- Year 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 Cases 8 1 2 3 2 8 1 6 - - - 1 - - Deaths 1 - 1 - - - - - - - - - - - Arrangements are made whereby doctors may collect anti-poliomyelitis vaccine from the Public Health Department. At the end of the year good progress had been made towards the protection by vaccination of the priority groups for which vaccine had been issued by the Ministry of Health. These groups were:- All persons who have not at the time of their application for vaccination reached the age of forty. General Medical Practitioners. Ambulance staff. Hospital staff who come into contact with patients. Medical students. Practising dental surgeons, dental students, dental hygienists, student-hygienists and dental surgeons' chairside assistants. Practising nurses not working in hospitals. Public Health staff who may come into contact with poliomyelitis cases. The families of the above groups. Expectant mothers who are particularly urged to be vaccinated as early as possible in pregnancy and such requests are dealt with as priorities. Persons going to visit or reside in a country outside Europe, other than Canada or the United States of America. Vaccination with Sabin oral vaccine was started in April 1962, and has since been increasingly used. The vaccine given by mouth, not only provides protection but also prevents protected persons from harbouring natural dangerous poliomyelitis virus and spreading disease to unprotected persons. This type of vaccine would be of great value during an epidemic because it works quickly. 15. FOOD POISONING. There were eight confirmed cases notified by general medical practitioners; the causative organisms were identified as shown below:- S. Typhi-murium 6 cases S. Poona 2 cases The ages of the eight persons were as follows:- 6/12 months S.

No outbreaks of food poisoning in the town were notified in 1963. LABORATORY FACILITIES. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); and opportunity is taken gratefully to acknowledge the co-operation of Dr. D.R. Gamble and his staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens are taken. Apart from routine samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the inspectors in the course of investigating suspected cases of dysentery, para-typhoid, food poisoning, etc. and taken to the Laboratory.

It was not necessary to take any action under these Regulations airing the year. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936 (Section 172) No action was taken under this section. 18. MASS RADIOGRAPHY The Mass X-ray unit did not visit the Borough during the year for open sessions but made examinations at industrial premises when the provisional total number of persons attending was:- Chessington and Tolworth 780 Surbiton 2020 Medical findings have not yet been received. The analysis of examinations made in respect of Surbiton for 1962 are contained in the Annual Report for that year made by the Medical Director of the Surrey Mass Radiography Service, as shown below:- Number of Examinations. Significant Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Primary Lung Cancer Male: Female: Male: Female: Male: Female: 4,120 3,680 4 2 2 1 The Medical Director states in his report:- "Figures from the Ministry of Health reported in the National Press have emphasised the decreasing mortality rate from tuberculosis in the last decade. This has lulled the general public into a feeling of security and they no longer volunteer for open Mass Radiography sessions as they did ten years ago. We have the equipment and the staff to x-ray larger numbers at these sessions. Our own limited resources for publicity are quite inadequate to convince the general public that tuberculosis is still a serious problem and it is hoped that the Ministry will agree to promote a national publicity campaign to encourage people to volunteer for annual chest x-ray through the Mass Radiography Service." KINGSTON & DISTRICT TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE. This is a local voluntary Committee which raises funds and gives help to families with tuberculosis and other chest diseases. It works with the Surrey County Council official services and is formed from representatives of the four District Councils in the North Central Division together with other interested persons. The Town Council appoints two representatives annually and the representatives during 1963-4 were as follows:- Alderman Mrs. A. Woodgate, J.P. Mr. J.R. Ashton. During the year 1963 an amount of £2,187 was spent on giving help to 115 families in the Division, 30 of these were Surbiton residents. 19. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. Daring the year eighty medical examinations were carried out at the Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas, These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service, also members of staff attaining the age of 18 years to determin their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme, members of the Borough Engineer's outdoor staff after completing six months' service to determine their suitability for entry into the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, also to examine special cases referred for investigation. The latter usually necessitated a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospital specialists. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE. There is in the Borough much voluntary work devoted to this cause such as provision of weekly clubs, daily centre, arranging seaside holidays, distribution of Christmas gifts and visiting of house-bound. The work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life and presided over by The Worshipful the Mayor. The Town Council leases to the Committee a large house known as "Alfriston", Berrylands Road, which after extensive works of repair and re-decoration, was opened in September 1958 as a Centre for old people, including clubrooms, recreation rooms, handicraft room, chiropody clinic and canteen. The chiropody service is now being conducted on behalf of the County Council. A meals on wheels service is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society, and the Council makes a generous contribution towards the cost involved. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was approximately 4,680. The Borough Council has provided one hundred and six special flats for aged people. There can be no exaggeration of the importance of this work for the old people, or of its increasing urgency as year succeeds year and more survive to the older age groups. The decision of the Council to increase its annual grant to the Old People's Welfare Committee to £1,500 is a gesture which should enable that Committee to extend its work for the elderly in ways which it has hitherto been unable to do owing to lack of finance. CO-ORDINATION OF HEALTH AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. In 1957 a committee of the Council was formed to consider and report upon methods of co-operation between the Town Council and other bodies concerned with the health and other social services within the Borough, to assist if required in the co-ordination of such work, and to examine ways of encouraging recruitment of more voluntary workers. The need for such work was indicated by the consideration of the Housing Committee of the previously published report of the working Party of the Surrey County Council on the Prevention of Break-up of Families. There was also a conference between the Housing Committee, the Old People's Welfare Committee and the W.V.S. at which all aspects of the provision of services for the elderly was discussed. The matter has not developed further, and it now seems unlikely to do so until the London re-organisation scheme becomes operative on 1st April 1965. 20. NURSING IN THE HOME (District Nursing). The Headquarters of the District Nursing Association is at 21-23, Upper Brighton Road (Telephone Number Elmbridge 3027) where application should be made for the services of a district nurse or midwife. Such applications have to be supported by the family doctor under whose direction all homo nursing is given. The District Nursing Services are administered by the Surrey County Council through the Divisional Medical Officer of Health who is also Medical Officer of Health for Surbiton. There is at the District Nursing Headquarters in Upper Brighton Road a very valuable and successful training school for District Nurses and Midwives. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS The ante-natal clinic can serve as the focal point for all activities relating to the expectant and nursing mother. The health visitor from the ante-natal clinic follows up cases at home for the purpose of advising and helpingthe expectant mother in all matters relating to pregnancy. Mothers are also encouraged to attend these clinics after their confinement to make sure that full health and normality is restored. This service is additional and designed to supplement that which an expectant mother is entitled to receive from a general practitioner and midwife. HOME HELP SERVICE. Persons desiring to avail themselves of this service should apply, supporting their application with a medical certificate, to the Divisional Medical Officer, the Health Centre, Grange Road, Kingston upon Thames, who will arrange for the Divisional Home Help Supervisor to visit and investigate the application. WATER SUPPLY. The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply and there are no wells or standpipes in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. This dependable first class water supply is a tremendous factor in maintaining the good health of the people of Surbiton. The question of adjustment of fluoride in the public water supply to a level appropriate for the prevention of dental decay was again considered by the COUNCIL. By a majority decision they resolved "that the County Council be informed that so far as this Authority are concerned, they strongly disapprove of the addition of fluoride to the water supplies within the Borough. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Hogsmill River is the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. Now that sewage effluent from Epsom is no longer discharged into it it is again a clean stream. 21. The River Thames is the northern boundary and whilst there is no bathing a pleasant riverside promenade gives much pleasure to many people and boating and yachting are popular pastimes. The island known as Ravens Ait belongs to the Navy League and Sea Cadet Corps and is used as a national boat training station for sea cadets. SWIMMING BaTHS . Publicly owned bath. The Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is from Metropolitan Water Board mains and is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition eighteen samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School baths. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine with changes of water as necessary. Six samples were take by the Public Health Department to ensure adequate chlorination and fitness for bathing, all of which proved to be satisfactory. A new swimming bath was provided at a primary school as a result of efforts by the parents. Sterilisation, filtration and heating plant is installed. Six samples wore taken during the year and were satisfactory. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved under contract for disposal into privately owned pits. SEWERAGE. There are very few cesspools remaining, nearly all properties in the Borough being connected to the public sewerage system. A new relief sewer has been constructed by the Council along the Hook Road to augment the existing sewer which had become inadequate Sundry remedial works have been carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department to deal with flooding during times of heavy rainfall, and a new surface water sewer in the Tolworth area is shortly to bo constructed. 22.

IMPROVEMENT GRAFTS.. The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases (a) where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, and (b) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. These grants are now known as "Discretionary Grants" and are paid solely at the discretion of the local authority. During the year 2 applications were received, one was approved and one not recommended. In addition, the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, requires local authorities to make grants towards the cost of providing "standard amenities" in dwellings; and makes certain amendments to the existing provisions relating to improvement grants. Further amendments to the scheme were introduced by the 1961 Housing Act. 27. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS (Cont.) The standard amenities now are (a) a fixed hath or shower in a "bathroom; (b) a washhand basin; (c) a hot water supply at a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom, and at a washhand basin, and at a sink; (d) a water-closet in, and accessible from within, the dwelling; (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. The amount of the "standard grant” which, subject to certain conditions, can be claimed as of right is one half of the cost of the approved works, subject to a maximum of £155. The limit of £155 is reduced as follows in respect of amenities which already exist:- Amenity: Reduction: £. Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom 25 Washhand basin 5 Hot water supply to bath,basin and sink 75 Water closet 40 Satisfactory food store 10 Forty standard grant applications were received, 38 were approved, one withdrawn, and one not recommended.

This Act, together with its accompanying Regulations has been in operation since 6th July, 1957.

The Minister of Housing and Local Government made regulations under Part II of the Housing Act, 1961, which came into operation on 2??? May, 1962, to deal with squalid living conditions in houses in multiple occupation. Until 1954 bye-laws existed which could be applied to such premises, but these were then repealed and replaced by a general power which proved to be an unsatisfactory substitute. The new provisions are far-reaching and should considerably strengthen the hands of local authorities in dealing with properties of this type for which, despite lack of essential amenities, there seems to be an ever-increasing demand by people whose circumstances compel them to seek accommodation in rooms in houses let to a number of individuals or families. The need for this control is apparent, and some progress was made during the year in locating and inspecting houses occupied in this way. The work will continue, but it is very time-consuming and will take a long period to complete. 31. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. A common Lodging-house is defined as "a house (other than a public assistance institution) provided for the purpose of accommodating by night poor persons, not being members of the same family, who resort thereto and are allowed to occupy one common room for the purpose of sleeping or eating, and includes, where part only of a house is so used, the part so used". There are no such premises in this Borough. FOOD INSPECTION. Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not fit were surrendered by the owners and destroyed by burning or burying. The total weight of such goods was :- cwts. qrs. lbs. ozs. 10 - - 13 There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough,consequently the only meat inspection carried out is in butchers shops,canteens, etc. 43 samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination in the laboratory as a routine measure to check on fitness for human consumption. FOOD HYGIENE. 44 premises are registered under section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955,for the preparation or manufacture of sausages,or potted,pressed,pickled or preserved foods intended for sale, and 21 premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (including the preparation of fish by any process of cooking and the cooking of poultry). 987 visits were made to these premises and to shops,canteens, restaurants, public houses, food-handling businesses, and vehicles, to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation:- Protection of food from contamination 23 Protective clothing for staff 1 Sinks provided 1 Washhand basins provided 5 Hot water supply provided 9 Wastepipes repaired or renewed 5 Food rooms cleansed 45 Walls and ceilings repaired 8 Floors repaired 4 Water pipes and cisterns repaired 4 W.Cs.cleansed or repaired 7 Windows repaired or renewed 1 Rooms ventilated 1 Doors repaired or renewed 2 Drains cleansed or repaired 4 Refuse bins provided 3 Accumulations removed 1 Renewal or cleansing of equipment 1 Name and address on vehicle 1 Storage clothing 1 Washable head covering 1 Smoking 3 “Wash hands" notice 1 Towel, soap and nailbrush 1 First aid equipment 2 Paving repaired 1 Storage for waste food improved 1 32. FOOD HYGIENE. (Cont.) Whilst the standard of hygiene has "been maintained at a reasonably satisfactory level, it is a subject which calls for constant attention by the Inspectors. FOOD & DRUGS.

Cucumber in Vinegar. The unqualified term 'vinegar' in this country means malt vinegar and the Public Analyst expected an article described as 'Sliced Cucumber in Vinegar' to be made with malt vinegar. Information on another part of the label stated that the vinegar constituent was "Fruit Wine Vinegar produced in the orchards of Kent and Sussex”. The appropriate description of such vinegar was cider vinegar and in the opinion of the Public Analyst this article should be so described. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers who stated that the article was out of production but when they envisaged re-markceting they would submit to the Council proofs of new labels for comment. 35. FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) 2674 (informal) Minced Steak with Gravy and Onion. The ingredients of this article specified on the label included 'Seasoning', but this is a generic and not a specific description and is not an appropriate designation for the purpose of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers who agreed to discontinue use of word "Seasoning" in all future printings of their labels. 2677 (informal) pumpernickel. Misleading illustration on the label. Illustrated as being 3 slices of bread forming a double sandwich filled with thick layers of what would appear to be cream or butter. Also, one of the sandwiches had a fruit-like decoration on top. This article consisted of black bread in the form of a rectangular block of 7 closely adhering slices with no other ingredients or additions. Correspondence and interviews took place with London Importers and as a result a new label omitting the illustration was submitted and approved. The ingredients of these two articles as specified on the label included 'Vegetable Stabiliser',but this is a generic and not a specific name or description and is not an appropriate designation for the purpose of the Labelling of Food Order,1953. The manufacturers stated that these soups were not made during spring and summer, but gave the assurance that when production commenced in early autumn packets would bear an amended label. 2694 (informal) Chicken Capri. Contained only 18 per cent of chicken and other meat, including fat, instead of a reasonable minimum of 35 per cent. Following correspondence the manufacturers undertook to amend the wording on the label and to slightly increase the meat content. 2703 (informal) Cherry Pie Filling. One of the ingredients specified on the label was vegetable gum, but this is a generic and not a specific term and is not an appropriate designation for the purpose of the Labelling of Food Order,1953. The Importers submitted a revised label which was satisfactory and gave an assurance that no further supplies would be exported with the incorrect list of ingredients. 36. FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.1 2735 (informal) Cultured Buttermilk Drink. False description. Consisted of cultured skimmed milk and not buttermilk. Correspondence took place with the manufacturers and after careful consideration it was decided not to proceed further in the matter. FOOD & DRUGS ACT.1955. Foreign matter in food. Mould Growth in Pork Pie. A resident purchased a small pork pie at a shop in the Borough and when the pie was cut, it was noticed that there was a white fungus on top of the meat and beneath the pastry. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers and the retailer concerned, and after giving consideration to the matter the Council decided that- (i) A letter deprecating the occurrence "be sent to the retailer. (ii) That an approach be made to the manufacturers, regarding the coding systems used on the wrappers and containers of perishable foodstuffs. (iii) That a letter be sent to the Minister of Health on the subject. Subsequently a representative of the manufacturers attended a meeting of the Public Health Committee and discussed the problem of date stamping pre-wrapped perishable meat products. The Committee was favourably impressed with the extreme care taken by the manufacturers in dealing with articles of this type, and felt that no further steps could be recommended. MILK SUPPLY. 1. The Milk (Special Designation)Regulations, 1960._ At the end of the year there were 78 Dealers' (Pre-packed Bilk) licences in force, as shown below Pasteurised 36 Sterilised 17 Tuberculin Tested 25 2. Registration. At the end of the year there were forty-four entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of Milk (Premises in the borough) 32 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 3 37. MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) Milk Sampling. 63 samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests:- Clot on boiling test Turbidity Test Phosphatase Test. Methylene Blue Test Tuberculin Tested (Farm cartoned) - - - 4 Tuberculin Tested (Raw Milk) 2 - - 2 — - 111 T.T.Pasteurised - - 13 13 Pasteurised (C.I.) - - 1 1 Pasteurised - - 35 35 |Sterilised - 8 - - All samples conformed to the required standard. The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the clot on boiling test is used to check cleanliness of tuberculin tested milk when sampled at the farm before bottling. ICE CREAM. (i) Registration: 175 premises are registered by the Council under Section 1 6, Food & Drugs Act, 1955, as under:- For manufacture, storage and sale 4 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 5 For storage and sale but not manufacture 165 For storage only 1 (ii) Samples: 269 samples were taken, details being as follows:Ice Cream. Grade 1 205 76.21% Grade 2 24 8.92% Grade 3 25 9.29% Grade 4 15 5.58% 100% 269 38. ICE CREAM (Cont.) All the Grade 3 and 4 reports together with some of the Grade 2 were concerned with one company and indicate a concentrated effort to help the firm (whose factory is not in this Borough) and the Inspector for the district involved to trace and eliminate a source of contamination. Whilst the precise cause of the unsatisfactory results was not definitely established, it seemed to he "basically "teething" troubles in a new factory which were successfully dealt with, and subsequent samples were consistently good. The Public health Laboratory Service advises that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six monthly period, 50% a vendor's samples should fall into grade 1 , 80% into grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into grade 3 and none into grade 4. There is now no ice cream manufactured within the Borough except from soft ice cream machines fitted on vehicles. MOVEABLE POLLINGS. The following sites remain licenced either under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, or the Public Health Act, 1936, Section 269. 1. The Riverhill Estate the lease of which is held by a local Sports Club and where 36 caravans are permitted. 2. One caravan in the orchard of a private house. 3. A temporary summer-house type of dwelling on a large plot of land used only occasionally. During the year a site licence was granted for the stationing of three caravans on land at Chalky Lane, Chessington, to be used as Circus Winter Quarters. This was not proceeded with by the applicant. As in the previous year a great deal of trouble was caused by itinerant caravan dwellers who placed their vehicles on sundry open sites in the Borough and were reluctant to move on. All the offenders were eventually removed after much difficulty, although it became necessary in three cases to take legal proceedings, viz:- (a) Green Lane Open Space.- Bench Warrants were issued in respect of illegal parking of moveable dwellings on this open space which was already covered by an Order. The owners of the open space agreed to the blocking up of the entrances to the field in question to prevent future parking. (b) Old Kingston Road. - The Magistrates made an Order prohibiting the parking of moveable dwellings in this area. (c) Telegraph Hill, Leatherhead Road - An Order was sought for the removal of 4 caravans and prohibiting the stationing of any further moveable dwellings within an area enclosed by a radius of 880 yards from the site. There are now nine Orders under the Surrey County Council Act in force in the Borough prohibiting the parking of moveable dwellings. 39. DISNFECTION. (a) (i) During the year disinfection was carried out free of charge at 13 premises as under:- Tuberculosis 7 Typhoid or suspected 2 Contagious rash 3 Miscellaneous 1 (ii) Disinfection of bedding and premises was also carried out where non-infectious illnesses had occurred on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. There were twenty-five such cases dealt with during the year. (b) The total number of articles disinfected was Feather Beds 1 Blankets 19 Mattresses 8 Mattress covers 1 Cushions 4 Pillows 21 Pillow cases 10 Rugs 5 Sheets 10 Curtains 4 Wearing apparel 73 Towels 4 Counterpanes 5 Bolsters 2 Miscellaneous 1 1 68 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 42 Ho. of library books disinfected 112 DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed, bugs, etc. Council Houses: Other Houses: Found to be infested Disinfested Found to be infested Disinfested Bugs 2 2 6 6 Cockroaches 4 4 - - (b) Wasps Nests. The Council has no responsibility for the destruction of wasp nests on private property, but many calls for assistance are received (53 this year). All complainants are visited and suitable advice given; in most cases the nests are easily disposed by the occupier using a recommended insecticide at sundown when can be applied with no danger to the operator. 40. PUBLIC MORTUARY, During the period 1st January to 30th April, 1963, fifty-nine todies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. Owing to the illness of the Attendant, the mortuary was closed from 6th May until the end of the year, and arrangements were made with the Kingston Group Hospital Management Committee for the reception of bodies in the mortuary at Kingston Hospital. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1943. SECTION 50., It was not necessary to make any burial arrangements as provided by section 50 of the Act. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTI0N 47. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 . It was necessary to apply to the Magistrates' Court for the compulsory removal of 1 person to a local Hospital on the grounds that, being an aged, infirm and physically incapacitated person, she was living in insanitary conditions, and was unable to devote to herself, and was not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The Order was made for three weeks, the maximum permissible time under this procedure. In fact the person concerned remained in hospital for 20 weeks and then returned to her home in a much improved state of health. THE PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Pour premises were licensed during the year. Eleven inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Seventy visits were made in the administration of this Act and 12 infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purpose of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1963 was:- Antique dealers and second-hand furniture 9 Bakers 19 Boots & Shoes 29 Builders and Decorators Supplies 27 Butchers 36 Cafes and Restaurants 39 Chemists 22 Confectioners, Newsagents and Tobacconists 92 Cycles, Radio and T.V. 22 41• SHOPS ACT 1950. (Cont.) Dairies and Milkshops 6 Drapers and Ladies Outfitters 53 Electrical Supplies 18 Fishmongers and Fried Fish Shops 14 General Stores 18 Greengrocers,Fruiterers and Florists 54 Grocers and Provision Merchants 74 Hairdressers 46 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 23 Licensed Premises 54 Motor & Cycle Dealers and Engineers 32 Tailors and Outfitters 16 Upholsterers and House Furnishers 14 Watchmakers and Jewellers 8 Miscellaneous 98 Total:- 523. No steps have yet been taken to deal with the present unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to trading hours in shops. The 1950 Act is merely a consolidation of legislation passed between 1912 and 1938, much bedevilled with case law and to a large degree unsatisfactory for today's way of life. What might be broadly termed welfare" conditions in shops have, however, at last received attention. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises, Act, 1963, received the Royal Assent on 31st July, 1963, and will come into force on dates in 1964 to be appointed by the Minister. This Act makes "fresh provision for securing the health, safety and welfare of persons employed in office or shop premise" and will be administered partly by local councils, partly by H.M. Factory Inspectorate and partly by the Fire Authority. The Act and its accompanying Regulations (many of which have yet to be made) are complicated and detailed, and the task of enforcement will be no light one. It is perhaps unfortunate that this legislation will come into operation in 1964 when authorities in the Greater London area are heavily involved in re-organisation and its attendant staff problems. It seems probable that additional staff will be required to help cope with this work, but understandably existing Councils may not wish to further complicate the merger procedure by engaging extra staff at this juncture. CLEAN AIR ACT. 1956. The Council considered Circular 60/62 from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government about Smoke Control Orders in which the Minister asked "black area" authorities who have not prepared programmes to consider most carefully whether this is consistent with the health and well-being of their communities. The Council decided to re-affirm their last resolution on the subject which was as follows:- That the Minister be informed that this Council (A) reaffirm that they are in full agreement with the desirability of reducing tne emission of smoke from domestic chimneys. (B) are of opinion that residents are voluntarily changing to smokeless fuels at a satisfactory rate, it being unlikely that this rate will be significantly increased by legislation. (In this respect, the Council further believe that emission of smoke in the Borough is not excessive at the present time), and to reconsider the matter in a year s time in January 1964. 42 FACTORIES ACT.1961. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 302 (258 mechanical, 17 non-mechanical and 27 works of "building construction). Two hundred and sixty-eight visits v/ere made to these premises and work was carried out to remedy contraventions as follows:- Particulars: No. of cases in which defects found and remedied. Want of cleanliness 4 Inadequate ventilation 1 Insufficient sanitary conveniences 4 Unsuitable or defective sanitary conveniences 13 Other offences, etc. 18 There were 98 outworkers on the register at the end of the year.

NOISE ABATEMENT. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, came into operation on 27th November, 1960, the main provisions being as follows:- (i) Noise or vibration. Under section 1, a noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with under Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. Under this procedure, local authorities are able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises, and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrate's court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft, which are subject to other statutory controls, nor to noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers. In the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practical means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect; (ii) Loudspeakers in streets. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. except in the following circumstances (a) For Police, Fire Brigade or Ambulance purposes, or by a local authority within their area; . (b) For communieating with persons on a vessel for the purpose of directing the movement of that or any other vessel; (c) If the loudspeaker forms part of a public telephone system; (d) If the loudspeaker (1) Is in or fixed to a vehicle; and (2) is operated solely for the entertainment of or for communieating with the driver or a passenger of the vehicle or, where the loudspeaker is or forms part of the horn or similar warning instrument of the vehicle, solely for giving warning to other traffic; and (3) is so operated as not to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity; (e) Otherwise than on a highway, by persons employed in connection with a transport undertaking used by the Public in a case where the loudspeaker is operated solely for making announcements to passengers or prospective passengers or to other persons so employed; 45. ' NOISE ABATEMENT (Cont.) (ii) Loudspeakers in streets - (Cont.) (f) By a travelling showman on land which is being used for the purpose of a pleasure fair; (g) In case of emergency. No trade, business or entertainment may be advertised by loudspeakers at any time, except that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are on sale; the loudspeaker is, however, not to he so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. (iii) Byelaws. Section 1+ preserves existing byelaws and byelaw making powers. Sixteen complaints were received during the year, seven of them with regard to ice cream vehicles. Four such vehicles were eventually traced and the drivers cautioned. A further seven complaints related to noises alleged to emanate from factories, and informal approach to the occupiers resulted in steps to mitigate the trouble. None of these complaints was of a serious nature. Two other complaints could not be substantiated. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, placed upon the occupiers or, in certain circumstances the owners,of land (including buildings) the responsibility for the destruction of rats and mice thereon and for keeping the land free from such pests. It is the duty of the Council to carry out inspections to see that this is done, and to secure so far as practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice. Where necessary they may serve upon owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. The policy of the Council is, however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff to give advice and practical help where appropriate, without charge subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. There is no legal obligation for the Council to do this and it does not undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but allows its staff to help so far as time permits. The Council is, however, responsible for its own property, including sewers, and the following tables shew the extent of the work carried out during the year. Sixty-nine schools, business, industrial and agricultural premises were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. 46. 47 visits . 1.
