PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Borough of IFest Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under order of the Local Government Board is required to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence. The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district, and with the means for improving those conditions. It should contain an account of the sanitary circumstances of the district, and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in those circumstances." In accordance with the above requisition, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1907, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which, therefore, are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. A 2 5 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,418 hours, being 315 1 hours less than in 1906. The hottest day was September 25th, when the temperature reached 82.7 degrees, and the coldest day was December 30th, 1906, when it sank to 19.8 degrees. The number of rainy days was 175, the total rainfall of the year being 23.48 inches. The greatest daily fall occurred on June 29th, when 1.03 inches fell. Meteorology during 1907. Week ending.

Below is given the area of the wards of the Borough (excluding water) and the population per acre in each ward at Census year:— Ward. Area in Acres. Persons per Acre.

The birth.rate for the year was 28 9 per 1,000, while the average birth.rate during the ten years 1897.1906 was 33.0 per 1,000. 8 Distributed to the various wards of the Borough the births were as follows:— Ward.

Deaths.—The number of deaths registered in the Borough during the year was 3,442, including the following deaths in public institutions within the Borough:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Plaistow Hospital 6 114 West Ham Hospital 10 40 St. Mary's Hospital 12 36 Seamen's Hospital — 52 Plaistow Maternity Nursing Home 3 2 Medical Mission Hospital 6 20 Non-residents registered in the district 7 77 9 The 3,442 deaths registered do not include the undermentioned deaths in public institutions:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Union Infirmary 44 587 Borough Asylum — 106 Dagenham Hospital — — Residents registered in London Institutions. 40 277 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the net deaths of the Borough numbered 4,412 (2,286 males and 2,126 females), being 198 less than the previous year and 351 below the average for the past ten years. This makes an annual death-rate of 14 "5 per 1,000, or 3'0 below the average death-rate during the ten years 1897-1906, which was 17*5 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution, this death-rate becomes 15.5 per 1,000, the factor for correction being 1.0693. In the following table the foregoing deaths are distributed to the various wards of the Borough, and the death-rates of the wards calculated from the estimated population at the middle of the j-ear. In obtaining these estimates regard has been had, firstly, to the natural increase of population (births over deaths), which in aggregate amounted to 4,347, and secondly, to the number of houses finally passed by the Borough Engineer for occupation during the year 1907. 10 The number of houses finally passed by the Borough Engineer were as follows:— New Town 1 West Ham 21 Forest Gate 7 Plaistow 133 High Street — Hudsons 89 Broadway — Canning Town — Park — Tidal Basin 6 Upton — Custom House 8 WARD MORTALITY STATISTICS.

Three hundred and thirty-one cows have been examined. In only one case was the udder distinctly tuberculous. It was arranged to remove the cow from the shed at once for slaughter; the general bodily condition being good and the disease apparently strictly localised. Four rather doubtful cases of indurated glands have been reserved for later inspection and will be reported on again if necessary. In the other cases of induration the aflected quarters were giving no milk. The few instances of sore teats were innocent congestive eruptions or abrasions. There was not a single case of acute mastitis, a curious exemption. Except for some coughing, both in the warm and cold sheds, the cows were in generally excellent health. There were none ill-nourished or emaciated. 15 SUMMARY. Animals examined. Tuberculous udder. Acute mastitis. Indurated' quarters. Sore teats. Reserved for further inspection.

Two summonses were issued in respect of Smoke Nuisances, but these were withdrawn on the Medical Officer of Health discovering that each of the firms were, in fact, in the process of installing electric plant with a view to the prevention of smoke nuisance. Shop Hours Acts and Seats for Shop Assistants Act.—During the year, 1812 shops have been visited, when the following infringements of provisions of the Acts were discovered:— In respect of excessive hours of employment 17 „ non-exhibition of Notice 201 „ want of proper seats 1 The details are set out in the following table and in the list of prosecutions. 27 The shops inspected are set out in the following table:— TRADES.

Applications were granted for the registration of a new keeper and deputy keeper at the common lodging-house, No. 211, High Street, Stratford, and for a new deputy keeper at No. 11, Fulton Street. An application for a new slaughter-house license at the rear of No. 9, Upton Lane was not granted. Bakehouses.—There are 165 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 46 are basement bakehouses duly certified by the Council. A new bakehouse was opened at No. 7, Balmoral Terrace, Prince Regent's Lane. • Offensive Trades.—An application was made for permission to establish the offensive trade of fat melting at premises known as Magnet Works, Marshgate Lane. The Public Health Committee viewed the premises, and, finding them unfit for the purpose, required the applicants to submit to the Medical Officer of Health plans and particulars of alterations they were prepared to make. The applicants failed to submit these particulars, and permission to establish the trade on the above site was not granted. New premises were erected in Barber's Road, Stratford, by Mr. V/. Hornett, for carrying on the trade of bone boiling, permission having been obtained from the Council, as stated in my report for 1906. 29 An application was received for permission to carry on fat melting and bone boiling at No.30, Marshgate Lane. The premises being in a dilapidated condition, the applicant was required to submit plans and particulars of the buildings and plant he was prepared to erect in the event of permission being granted. No particulars were submitted and the application was not granted. The British Organic Conversion Company, successors to Messrs. F. Hammersley & Co., carrying on the trades of fat melting, bone boiling and soap making in Bradfield Road, Silvertown, made application for permission to treat blood and other organic matter. This application was granted on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee after a visit to the factory. Application was made by the Co-operative Wholesale Society for permission to establish the trade of soap making in new buildings about to be erected at their premises at Silvertown, and permission was granted subject to the approval by the Medical Officer of Health of the plant to be used. Bye-laws.—New Bye-laws, made under Section 26 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, prescribing the times for removal of offensive matter within or through the Borough, were adopted by the Council on 9th July, and allowed by the Local Government Board on 22nd August, 1907. The Bye-laws provide that offensive matter shall be removed between 6a.m. and 12 noon during the months of November, December, January and February, and between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. during the remaining months of the year. They also require the provision of properly constructed receptacles and carts, and provide for the cleansing of any footway or carriage way upon which offensive matter may have been spilled during the process of removal. Pollution of Rivers Act.—A meeting was held at the offices of the Lee Conservancy Board, attended by the Medical 30 Officers of Health of the districts abutting on the Lee Navigation. The meeting, convened by the Board, was of a private character, and discussed the subject of sewage effluent standards, with special reference to the upper and lower reaches of the River. A special meeting of the Essex Field Club was held at the Technical Institute in the Autumn when the subject of Pollution of Rivers was discussed by eminent scientists and manufacturers. Subsequently, at the instance of the British Science Guild, your Council addressed a letter to the President of the Local Government Board, urging the advisability of legislation upon the matter. Midwives Act, 1902.—The Midwives' Roll for 1907 contained the names of 181 Certified Midwives residing in West Ham. Only 32 midwives sent in notice of their intention to practice during the year in accordance with Section 10 of the Act. 385 records of sending for medical aid were received from 39 midwives, and 57 notices of stillbirth. Of the total 8,759 births 4,841 were attended by certified midwives attached to the Institutions of the Plaistow Maternity Charity, as under:— Howard's Road— 2,929 Midwife in sole charge. 673 „ nursing for medical man. Lansdowne Road— 1,083 Midwife in sole charge. 156 ,, nursing for medical man. During the year the Central Midwives Board issued a new edition of Rules under the Act in place of those issued in 1903, the modifications of which need not be discussed as they primarily relate to the duties of the practising midwife. 31 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. Under these Acts 1,219 samples were purchased for analysis, and 107 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated, the number of samples taken being at the rate of 4.3 per 1,000 of the census population. In London the samples taken during the year 1906 were at the rate of 4.9 per 1,000, and in the rest of England at the rate of 2.4 per 1,000. I applied for summonses in 77 cases, at the hearing of which fines and costs amounting to £201 3s. 0d. were imposed. The particulars of these will be found in the appendix. Adulterated. Genuine.

Article III of the Order provides for the endorsement of the certificate of registration where any change occurs in the persons carrying on the business. In accordance with the above Order, premises at Crayford Mills, Stratford, were registered as a manufactory of margarine, premises in 35 Forest Gate where the business of wholesale dealer in Margarine is carried on, and four premises in various districts of the Borough where the business of wholesale dealer in milk blended butter is carried on.
