OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1892. TO THE YESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Thirty-seventh Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of St. Pancras I.—Introduction. Various causes have successively delayed, during 1893, the issue of this Report. The Enquiry at the beginning of the year into the Insanitary Areas made large demands upon the time of the Department for statistical and other information. The changes in the staff of the Department, and especially in the office of First Assistant Clerk, upon whom the duties of extracting statistical records, etc. fall, and to which duties the present officer was quite new. The increase of work thrown upon the Department by the scarlet fever epidemic, which has prevailed for several months, also prevented progress. Falling at this period of the year, some consideration must be shown by the Department to the printers, who from the middle of July to the end of August have in hand the Borough List, an elaborate and bulky compilation. A few of the points of interest in the Report to which attention may he directed, are: — The successful working of the new system of dust collection from house to house. An account of the Disinfecting Station, and especially of the Family Shelter, accompanied by plans. The precautions necessary to prevent the advent of Cholera, and the preparations organised to meet an outbreak should it occur. Some account of the powers for controlling domestic water supply and for preventing its pollution. A brief recapitulation of the condition of the Regent's Canal, and the remedies recommended. The order of the Home Secretary under the Factory and Workshops Act, in reference to outworkers Some notice of the bakehouses in the district, and the proportions situated above and below ground, and in the Appendix details as to the distance of the floors of underground bakehouses from the surface. The following table is a statement of the meteorological conditions in London during the four quarters, and the year 1892. 8 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1892. Periods. Barometer. Temperature.

As stated in previous Reports, the population of St. Pancras may be estimated as stationary, and as in the two previous years the population of the Districts and Sub-Districts, after correction and re-distribution, is estimated as follows:— Regent's Park 37471 Tottenham Court 26509 Gray's Inn Lane 28028 Somers Town 33545 Camden Town 14344 Kentish Town 96535 St. Pancras 236432 MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during the year was 2140, being 20 more than in the preceding year, but 17 less than the annual average of the preceding ten years. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered during the year was 6892, being 296 less than in the preceding year, and 573 less than the annual average during the preceding decennium. 12 The 186 births occurring in Public Institutions having been re-distributed according to population, the number of births and the birth-rate of each of the Sub-Districts and of the District were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number of Births. Birth-rate.

During the year the corrected total number of deaths from all causes at all ages was 5157, being 41 lees than during the preceding year, and 347 above the annual average of the preceding ten years. Per 1000 of population, the Death-rate was 21.8 as compared with 22.0 in the preceding year, and an annual average of 20.3 in the preceding decennium. The total number of Deaths and the Death-rates in the Sub-Districts are set out below, 256 deaths from all causes not referable to any particular Sub-Districts being distributed according to population: — Sub-Districts.

Zymotic Diseases. The principal zymotic diseases —namely, small-pox, measles, scarlatina, typhus, whooping-cough, diphtheria, continued fever, enteric fever, diarrhoea, and dysentery—were the cause of 724 deaths compared with 522 in the previous year, and an annual average of 634 during the previous ten years. The number of deaths in the Sub.Districts and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths were as follows:— Sub.Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1C00 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 116 3.1 148.7 Tottenham Court 68 2.5 116.2 Gray's Inn Lane 89 31 141.7 Somers Town 141 4.2 162.1 Camden Town 42 2.9 136.4 Kentish Town 268 2.7 135.0 St. Pancras 724 3.0 140.4 London 12,070 2.8 137.5 No deaths were registered in St. Pancras during the year from typhus and simple continued fever, and only two deaths occurred from small-pox. The number of deaths from diarrhoea and dysentery, and from whooping-cough, were below the annual average of the last ten years, and from enteric or typhoid fever nearly one. half below the average. Scarlet fever, diphtheria, and measles caused more than the annual average number of deaths namely, scarlet fever more than one.half more, diphtheria two.thirds more, and measles approaching to double as many. In fact, an epidemic of measles passed over St. Pancras during the second quarter of the year. Measles, not being a notifiable disease, the morbidity can only be estimated from the mortality ; and, taking it at 10 per cent., the 229 deaths would represent 2,290 cases, or as many cases of sickness as were due to all the notifiable infectious diseases together. The deaths from notifiable infectious diseases will be agaiu referred to in Part III. uuder the head of Notification. Influenza.—In January, 1892, the third successive epidemioof influenza occurred causing a marked rise in the death.rate for some weeks. But this epidemic, in conjunction with the two preceding ones, was fully considered in the Annual Report for 1891. 15 TUBERCULAR DISEASES. The Tubercular Diseases caused 666 deaths, compared with 746 in the preceding years, the incidence in the Sub-Districts was as follows: — Sub-Districts. Numbers. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 total Deaths. Regent's Park 112 2.9 143.6 Tottenham Court 99 3.7 169.2 Gray's Inn Lane 77 2.7 122.6 Somers Town 122 3.6 140.3 Camden Town 41 2.8 133.1 Kentish Town 215 2.2 108.3 St. Pancras 666 2.8 129.2 London 11862 2.8 135.2 RESPIRATORY DISEASES. The Respiratory Diseases caused 12.52 deaths compared with 1307 in 1891, 1140 in 1890, and 874 in 1889, Influenza being the indirect cause of the increased mortality. The incidence of these Diseases in the Sub-Districts was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Numbers. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 total Deaths. Regent's Park 168 4.4 215.4 Tottenham Court 139 5.2 237.6 Gray's Inn Lane 147 5.2 234.1 Somers Town 253 7.5 290.9 Camden Town 70 4.8 227.3 Kentish Town 475 4.9 239.2 St. Pancras 1252 5.8 242.8 London 19379 4.5 220.8 16 VIOLENT DEATHS. Violence was the cause of 199 Deaths during 1892, or one less than in the preceding year, the numbers for 1890 and 1889 being 165 and 177, respectively. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. The number of uncertified deaths registered in St. Pancras was 5, the same number as in the preceding year, in 1890 and 1889, the numbers were 9 and 5 respectively. INQUESTS During the year 480 inquests were held. All inquests held in St. Pancras now take place in the St. Pancras Coroner's Court. PUBLIC MORTUARIES. Number of bodies deposited in the General Mortuary 472 Number of bodies deposited in the Infectious Mortuary 15 Total 487 COMPARATIVE MORTALITY OF THE SUB-DISTRICTS. The preceding tables show that according to population the Somers Town SubDistrict has the highest, and Kentish Town the lowest death-rates from all causes at all ages, that Somers Town has the highest and Tottenham Court the lowest death-rate from zymotic diseases, that Tottenham Court has the highest, very closely followed by Somers Town, and Kentish Town the lowest death-rate from tubercular diseases, that Somers Town has the highest and Regent's Park the lowest death-rate from respiratory diseases. Again, according to population, Somers Town has the lowest death-rate at 60 years of age and over, whereas it has the highest death-rate at ft to 60 years, more markedly the highest under one year, and most markedly the highest at ages under 5 years. The position held by Somers Town as suffering from a greater destruction of life compared to the other Sub-Districts is confirmed by the proportion of deaths to births. Somers Town stands in this proportion markedly the highest in death-rates under 5 years of age, and stands second in order of mortality under one year. 17 III.—INFECTIOUS DISEASES. NOTIFICATION. The number of cases of the Notifiable Infectious Diseases certified to your Medical Officer of Health during the year 1892, and the Sub-Districts in which they occurred, are shown in the following table:— Population—1891 Census.

In the previous year the fatality per cent. of Diphtheria, Erysipelas, and Scarlatina, was, respectively, 27, 3, and 5. This year the fatality was 26.39, 2.11, and 5.24, practically no marked difference in the two years. So that, although Scarlatina and Diphtheria during 1892 were twice as prevalent as in the previous year, there was little difference in the comparative fatality. Cholera.—In August last your Vestry authorised the Health Committee to take any action they might consider requisite for the prevention of Cholera. Upon this certain printed Precautions and Preparations were devised and drafted and freely circulated. They have been kept in readiness since, revised up to date, and prepared for issue at any moment, and the following are copies of the revised precautions and preparations:— SAINT PANCRAS HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Cholera Precautions. A. The Disease and its manner of Spreading. Cholera is a disease that may occur in varying degrees of severity—from slight diarrhoea to urgent cholic, vomiting, and cramps. The contagion is cast off from an infected person in the discharges from the bowels and the stomach— that is to say, by the stools and the vomits. The contagion is taken into a healthy person through the mouth, mainly, if not solely, by the contaminated water, and the liquid and solid food that is consumed The contagion reaches the general water supply through contamination by the bodily discharges, specifically polluted liquids, or infected effluvia that may gain access to it; and the contaminated water supply spreads the contagion on a large scale by being drunk in the raw state, and also by infecting, in the process of preparation, liquid and solid food substances consumed. In individual instances, in nursing an infected sick person, the contagion may also be conveyed to the mouth, or to the food or drink consumed, by means of the hands or person, the towels, linen, clothing, or bedding fouled by the discharges. 21 B.—Sanitary Precautions to be taken in the presence of a threatened outbreak. 1.— Domestic Precautions. Cisterns should be thoroughly cleansed, overflow pipes therefrom should be severed from drains, and service pipes therefrom should be cut off from direct communication with water-closet basins. If a cistern be situated in an inaccessible position, or have improper connexions, or be otherwise liable to pollution, and if the water supply be on the constant high-pressure system, it is advisable to remove the taps from the cistern or service-pipe and to fix them on the main supply-pipe. Water-closets, sinks, and drains must be made secure against giving off foul odours, and should be kept thoroughly cleansed and flushed. Thorough-flushing of the drains should be carried out daily, by turning on suddenly, and for a short time, as large a volume of water as possible—a partial prolonged flushing is only waste of water and useless. All the taps, plugs, and tanks should be turned on in every house at one o'clock in the day, for five or ten minutes, and the greatest good would be done thereby in flushing both the house drains and the sewers. All refuse should be burnt at once, and the ashes be placed in a portable receptacle ready for the dustman to remove when he calls. The contractors are bound by their contracts to call at every house in the Parish at least once in every week, and any omission should be promptly reported to the Health Department, Yestry Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. All premises should be kept thoroughly clean, inside and out, and yards and areas be cleansed daily, and lime-whited when and where necessary. The interior of rooms and houses should be thoroughly and through-ventilated, and articles of clothing and furniture be freely exposed to the air. Stables, cow-houses, slaughter-houses, and other premises occupied by animals should be cleansed daily, and the manue, offal, and other refuse, removed at short intervals 2.—Personal Precautions. A regular and cleanly life must be led. Foods liable to produce disturbances of digestion, especially those that irritate the stomach or cause diarrhoea, should be avoided. Food and drink should be cooked or boiled the same day as consumed; this especially applies to water, milk, vegetables, and many fruits. Tea, coffee, and cocoa, fresh made with boiling water and boiled milk, are the best form of drinks. Remedies should be immediately resorted to in order to check relaxed bowels; and, if diarrhoea set in, a medical practitioner should be at once consulted. C.—Sick-room Precautions. A person suffering from suspicious diarrhoea or vomiting should be at once isolated and a medical practitioner summoned. Only those on duty and a relation in an emergency, should be permitted to visit the patient. Healthy persons attending suspected or infected patients should not eat or drink in the sick room, but should retire for this purpose to another room, and carefully wash the hands and face (mouth), and change the outer clothing if necessary before sitting down to eat. All food or drink leaving the sick room should be cast away or destroyed, and not, on any account, be consumed by healthy persons. 25 The most rigid cleanliness should be observed in the sick-room, and a bottle of the following powerful Cholera Disinfectant should be ready at hand—Corrosive Sublimate Disinfectant Solution—Half an ounce of corrosive sublimate dissolved in one fluid ounce of hydrochloric acid and five grains of aniline blue dissolved in one ounce of wood naphtha, mixed together and made up to twelve ounces by the addition of water. To be kept in a twelve-ounce blue fluted poison bottle, labelled poison, with a patent poison cork, and to be carefully guarded and placed above the reach of children. A twelfth part to be mixed with every quart of water to make the disinfectant, it should not be further diluted, and must be kept in wooden, earthenware, or glass vessels, and not be brought into contact with metals. The disinfectant will be supplied gratuitously upon the written request of the Medical Attendant. Every stool or vomit of the patient should be disinfected in the sick-room in an earthenware pan or basin by mixing with it an equal volume of corrosive sublimate disinfectant solution, and allowiug it to stand half-an-hour before pouring it down the water-closet. Every soiled object that is washable should be placed to soak for several hours in corrosive sublimate disinfectant solution, in a wooden tub or earthen pan, and then again be allowed to soak out for several hours in common water before going to the wash. Unwashable infected objects, if soiled, should be burnt; if not soiled, should be disinfected by steam. A van will be dispatched to remove articles to be disinfected in the Steam Chamber, and bulky articles to be burnt in the Destructor, upon notice sent to the Health Department, Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, N W.

But when the numbers for the individual diseases are compared the results appear differently, as the following tables will show:— 1892. Cases Notified. Cases Removed. Remova's per cent. Small-pox 31 31 100 Diphteria 432 252 58.3 Scarlatina 1279 811 63.4 Scarlatina 119 56 47.0 Total (of three last) 1861 1150 61.1 30 1891. Cases Notified. Cases Removed.

During the year the bodies of 15 persons dying of infectious diseases were removed from dwelling-houses to the Infectious Mortuary. VACCINATION.

The number of rooms fumigated after infectious disease was 1,291, an increase of 566 on the previous year. The number of articles disinfected in the steam chamber was 21,376, an increase of 8,213. The number of articles destroyed by fire in the destruction chamber was 612, an increase of 221 on the previous year. Details of Disinfections. No. of Rooms fumigated 1,291 Articles. Destroyed.

According to the Census of 1891, St. Pancras contained 24,443 inhabited houses, held by 57,345 separate occupiers or families, or in that number of total tenements. Of the 57,345 total tenements, 44,693 were tenements of four rooms and less, namely—4,416 of four rooms, 8,689 of three rooms, 16,220 of two rooms, and 15,368 of one room. It may be said that in order to enable disinfection to be be properly performed all the families or single persons in one room will require temporary accommodation to be provided, and one-half of those in two rooms may be estimated also to require it; it would, therefore, be necessary to provide accommodation for 23,478 tenements or families. 34 The diseases requiring removal for fumigation, etc., are Small-pox, Diphtheria , Scarlet Fever, and Typhus Fever. 1892 was an epidemic year for Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, and, therefore, accommodation calculated on the figures of that year will not under-estiruate the amount required. During the year there were 1,727 cases of these diseases reported, or, excluding Sundays, an average of 5.5 a day from the 57,345 tenements in the District, a proportion of a little over two a day from the 23,478 tenements to be provided for. If, therefore, the Shelter accommodate four families it should suffice at least for present demands, provided that the arrangements for disinfection are sufficiently complete and expeditious. This last proviso is of extreme importance, as the slightest delay in disinfection, owing to over pressure, would necessitate families remaining overnight in the Shelter and block the means of providing accommodation. The Disinfecting Station is approached by a single entrance from Cambridge Street, King's Road, Pancras Road, N.W., or Cambridge Street, maybe approached through the St. Pancras Gardens, on the east side of which it is situated. It consists of an enclosed rectangular yard, bounded by blank walls on the north and south sides, and by the buildings of the station on the east and west sides. On the east side are situated the entrance gateway, the steam disinfecting chamber with stoke-hole, coalvault, charging and discharging rooms for infected articles, and the destruction furnace. On the west side are the waiting-room, coach-houses and stores, and over these the Family Shelter. In February, 1893, your Vestry, (upon the recommendation of the Health Committee, agreed to build a Family Shelter in accordance with the plan of your Borough Engineer, and the tender of Mr. Davenall, for £450, was accepted. The Shelter has been erected upon the single-storeyed buildings bounding the Disinfecting Station on the west side, and is approached by an iron staircase. It consists of four separate rooms, each containing a complete cooking range and a sink with draw-tap, and a bath-room and lavatory is attached to each living room. The four rooms have a respective capacity of 2,500, 1,000, 1,000 and 1,400 cubic feet, and open into a corridor provided with two w.c.'s fitted with modern apparatus. The baths and lavatory basins are supplied with both hot and cold water, and it is hoped that families taking shelter will avail themselves fully of the washing and cleansing arrangements, and of the opportunity of passing their personal clothing through the disinfecting chamber before returning home. The outlook of the shelter over the St. Pancras Gardens is extremely cheerful, and the self-contained disposition of the Disinfecting Station will secure undisturbed privacy to the occupants. The accompanying plans show the arrangements of the Disinfecting Station and of the Shelter. 35 IV—SANITATION. OPEN SPACES. The parks, public gardens and other open spaces secured against building operations in St. Pancras, together with their situation, approximate area, and the authority under which they are maintained are enumerated, as in previous years, in the following table:— Sub-Districts.

Moveable Dwellings.—No caravans, tents, or sheds have been reported to be occupied as dwellings within the District. Canal boats used as dwellings passing through, or discharging or loading in the District, have been from time to time inspected, but no contravention of the Acts has been discovered. Dwehing-Bouses.—House to house inspections include not only dwellinghouses, but premises used for other purposes not attached to dwelling-houses, but the number of such premises is so very small compared to the number of dwellinghouse premises proper, as to make little difference to the gross number of dwellinghouses inspected.- The number of streets inspected from house-to-house during the year was 80, consisting of 2,918 houses, of which 2,864 were occupied, and 54 were unoccupied and passed over. The inspected houses contained 19,048 rooms, of which 18,477 were occupied, and 571 unoccupied, by 8,693 separate families, consisting of 20,899 adults and ) 0,701 children. (Table 9b.) 36 In reference to the number of occupants in rooms, the number of rooms in tenements, and the number of tenements in houses, the following extracts from the Census Return, 1891, Vol. III., are of interest.

It is much to be regretted that there is no technical distinction between a dwelling and a lodging. There is a vast practical difference between a common dwelling-house and a common lodging-house. Houses let in separate dwellings may either be new houses specially built for that purpose or old houses made down, altered, or adapted for such use Of those specially built there are two types: those constructed in self-containe i dwellings, admission to which from the common stair is obtained by only one entrance ; and those constructed in such a manner that every room, or almost every room opens separately on to the common stair. The former embrace residential flats and the majority of block dwellings, the latter the villa types of residences. Of old houses made down or adapted there are many varieties, and the adaptations are of varying degrees of suitability. It is in this class of house that the majority of underground dwellings are found. Underground Dwellings.—The number of underground rooms closed against occupation as separate dwellings was 38. Registered "houses let in separate dwellings," or, as defined by the model byelaws, "houses let in lodgings to members of more than one family"; or, more briefly and more popularly, "tenemented houses," number 144 in the register. Although they are subject to the bye-laws, the multiplicity of duties falling upon your Sanitary Inspectors has hitherto left no time available for them to be regularly inspected, as they should be, at least once a year. Registered common lodging-houses are under the bye-laws and inspection of the police; but when requisite a Sanitary Inspector does not hesitate to inspect these premises also. A list of the registered lodging-houses will be found in the Appendix. 37 UNHEALTHY DWELLING-HOUSES. In continuation of the previous year's proceedings under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part II., the following houses have been represented:— Date of Representation of Medical Officer of Health. Premises. Dale and Resolution of Vestry. Date and Decision of Magistrate. 1891. October 30 Hastings Street— Cottages in rear of Nos. 26 and 27. 24th February, 1892. Notices to be served ordering that the premises be made fit for human habitation, and in default Closing Order to be applied for. 27th October, 1892. Closing Order was made. 1892. March 1 Sidney street— Cottage in rear of No. 29. 9th March, 1892. Ditto. Voluntarily closed. Resolution adopted by Vestry on 22nd Feb , 1893, that no further action be taken in respect to the Representation of the Medical Officer of Health for the present. June 10 Little Howland Street— 1. 20th July, 1892. Ditto. Premises converted into workshops, and viewed by Health Committee on 6th April, 1893. Committee recommended no further action be taken on the Representation of the Medical Officer of Health. Adopted by the Vestry at a meeting held on 19th April. 1893. In the first of these cases—namely, 26 and 27, Hastings Street—it was decided that the owner is the owner in accordance with the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and not of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Upon the application for the summonses, the Magistrate was of the latter opinion, and refused to grant them. Your Vestry then applied to the High Court for a mandamus, where it was ruled to the contrary and the mandamus granted. UNHEALTHY AREAS. During 1892, the Representations set out in the Annual Report of 1891, as to Insanitary Areas, remained under the consideration of the London County Council and of your Vestry. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The following Order, dated 31st October, 1892, was received by your Vestry, and a copy, covered by a circular letter, sent to the Occupier of every Factory and Workshop in the District carrying on the businesses scheduled:— 38 (No. 44.) FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACTS, 1878-1891. (Gazetted 4th November, 1892). Order of Secretary of State requiring Occupiers of certain Factories and Workshops to keep Lists of Outworkers. WHEREAS by Section 27 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, it is enacted that:— "The occupier of every factory and workshop (including any workshop conducted on the system of not including any child, young person, or woman therein) and every contractor employed by any such occupier in the business of the factory or workshop shall if so required by the Secretary of State by an Order made in accordance with Section 65 of the principal Act, and subject to any exceptions mentioned in the Order, keep in the prescribed form and with the prescribed particulars lists showing the names of all persons directly employed bv him, either as workman or as contractor, in the business of the factory or workshop, outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed, and every such list shall be open to inspection by any inspector under the principal Act or by any officer of a Sanitary Authority." Now I, the Right Honourable Herbert Henry Asquith. one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, by this Order, made under Section 65 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and Section 27 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, require the occupier of every factory and workshop (including any workshop conducted on the system of not employing any child, young person, or woman therein , and every contractor employed by any such occupier in any of the businesses mentioned in the schedule hereunder, to keep in the form and with the particulars hereunder prescribed, lists showing the names of all persons directly employed by him, either as workman or as contractor, in the said business outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed, and every such list shall be open to inspection by any inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, or by any officer of a Sanitary Authority. The order of the 18th July, 1892, under the above recited enactments, is hereby revoked. This order shall come into effect on the twentieth day of November, 1892, and shall continue in force until revoked. Whitehall, 31st October, 1892. HERBERT H. ASQUITH. SCHEDULE.

NOTE.—In order that these lists may be correct lists of persons employed at any given time, it will be necessary that the name of any person newly taken into employment should be immediately entered, and the name of any person ceasing to be employed should be immediately struck out. 39 By the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and Workshops Act, 1891, the duty is also placed upon the Sanitary Authority to cause all workshops and workplaces to be inspected and to be maintained in a sanitary condition. The Secretary of State expressed anxiety that steps should be taken for the inspection of the workshops and places in which out-workers are employed. The Local Government Board has urged tho desirability for frequent inspection of such workplaces and the necessity for remedying insanitary conditions therein. No inspections of these places have yet been made, nor is there any prospect of their being made by the present staff, whose time is fully occupied with urgent and routine work. Bakehouses.—Retail bakehouses are regulated as workshops under the special clauses of tho Factory and Workshops Acts. The regulations are directed to protecting the health of the workers rather than the wholesorneness of the bread, cakes, and other things made and cooked, for the most part during the night. It will be seen by referring to the List in the Appendix that of the 202 bakehouses in the District, of which 12 are at present closed, only 31 are so constructed that the floor is level with the street, the rest, or 85 per cent., are underground bakehouses, and with few exceptions over 7ft. below the level of the roadway. The bakehouses are inspected twice a year, and maintained in conformity with the requirements of the Acts, the sections of which were quoted in last year's Report, but these requirements do not touch the question of underground construction, and there is extreme difficulty in cleansing and ventilating a cellar such as an underground bakehouse. It would not be in the justice of things to interfere with existing rights, but bakehouses should be registere[???], for they are constantly changing ownership and being closed and re-opened. New bakehouses and bakehouses reopened after long intervals should be required to conform to a given standard of construction before being used for the production of bread and other foods. Bakehouses will be found again referred to under the head of Food Premises. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 48 (2), enacts that a house which after tho commencement of this Act is newly erected, or is pulled down to or below the ground floor and rebuilt, shall not be occupied as a dwelling-house until the sanitary authority have certified that it has a proper and sufficient supply of water, either from a water company or by some other means. The new dwelling-houses erected from time to time can be ascertained from the Reports of the Rating Committee presented quarterly to your Vestry, and set out in the private minutes. Questions constantly arise upon the Regulations made under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, and as these Regulations are not to be found printed, except in some earlier Reports of the Water Examiner, they are here reproduced. together with the Bye-laws for receptacles used for storing water, for the reference of your Health Department and of your Vestry generally. 40 REGULATIONS MADE UNDER THE METROPOLIS WATER ACT, 1871.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Bye-Laws. Made by the Vestry of the Parish of St. Pancras, in the County of London, being the Sanitary Authority for the said Parish, with respect to the Cleansing of Cisterns. Interpretation of Terms. 1.—Throughout these bye-laws the expression, " the Sanitary Authority," means the Vestry of the Parish of St. Pancras, in the County of London. For Securing the Cleanliness and freedom from Polution o f Tanks, Cisterns, and other Receptacles used for storing of Water used, or likely to be used, by Man for Drinking or Domestic Purposes, or for manufacturing Drink for the Use of Man. 2. —The owner of any premises who shall provide thereon a tank, cistern, or other receptacle to be used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall cause the same to be so constructed and placed that it may conveniently be cleansed. 44 3.—The owner of any premises on which a tank, cistern, or other receptacle not provided by the occupier of such premises is used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall cause every such tank, cistern, or other receptacle which is erected outside a building, or which being erected inside a building is not placed in a suitable chamber, or otherwise constructed or placed so as to prevent the pollution of the water therein, to be provided with a proper cover. 4. — The occupier of any premises on which a tank, cistern, or other receptacle is used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall empty and cleanse the same, or cause the same to be emptied and cleansed, once at least in every six months, and at such other times as may be necessary to keep the same in a cleanly state and free from pollution. He shall cause every such tank, cistern, or other receptacle which is erected outside a building, or which, being erected inside a building, is not placed in a suitable chamber, or otherwise constructed or placed so as to prevent the pollution of the water therein, to be kept at all times properly covered. Provided that in every case where any tank, cistern, or other receptacle used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, is used for supplying water to persons occupying two or more separately occupied premises, the foregoing requirements shall apply to the owner of such premises instead of to any occupier thereof. The person in occupation of, or having the charge, management, or control of the premises; or, if there is no such person, then any person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of any part of the premises, and in the case of any premises, the whole of which is let to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the lodgers, either on his own account, or as the agent of another person, shall, for the purposes of this bye-law be deemed to be the occupier. 5.—The occupier of any premises or any other person shall not obstruct or interfere with the owner of such premises, or with any person duly authorised by him in that behalf, in the execution of any work to which the foregoing bye-laws relate. Penalties. 6.—Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law. 45 Approved by the Vestry at a Meeting held on Wednesday, the 14th day of June, 1893.

Fowler, President. LS. Hugh Owen, Secretary. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. There is nothing of especial importance to note under this head. The laying of new drains and sewers, and the amendment of old, proceed continuously, se that their sanitary condition is being gradually improved throughout the wholo district. REGENT'S CANAL. In August, 1887, in reference to the Regent's Canal, the Cumberland Market Basin, and the arm leading thereto. I reported to this effect:— Firstly—As to dead animals; the Canal basin, and the Canal itself, are receptacles for most of the dead animals of the neighbourhood. The Company clear them away twice a week ; occasionally there has been delay, but, as a rule, the duty is fairly well done. Secondly—As to slime; when the wind blows from the northerly points, anything upon the surface of the arm, leading to the basin, is blown down into the basin, and. collects at the extreme southern end, mostly towards the east side. I have visited this point on many occasions, in company with the Sanitary Committee, and also unaccompanied, and I have had occasion, once or twice, to call the attention of the Sanitary Committee and of the Canal Company to the necessity for improvement at that particular spot. With the exception of one or two occupiers of the wharves at the south-easterly end, the occupier of wharves on the basin have stated upon enquiry, on several occasions, that they had no cause of complaint. Thirdly—As to odour; there have been complaints from a resident upon the bank of the arm leading to the basin, but I have not been able to verify any nuisance, possibly from its fitful occurrence. It is conceivable that a nuisance might arise from refuse cast into the Canal accumulating, due to wind or surface current from passing boats, but that spot seemed an unlikely point at which it would arise. 46 Fourthly—As to nuisance generally; the basin is probably more liable to accumulate bottom refuse on account of the stationing of barges at the wharves, the loading and discharge of cargo, &c., and the easy access to the water-way at the wharves, and therefore should demand the greatest attention of the Company. I nm under the impression that the dredging is more pursued in the Canal itself, which is fairly clear of mud, &c., more so than the basin. There is a sluice valve at the southern end of the basin communicating with the sewers. When the Canal Company opened this valve, which formerly they have done when there was sufficient water, and at other times they gave notice to the Works Department to warn the flushers in the sewers, but the Chief Surveyor informs me that the last occasion is a considerable time back. Recommendations.—The basin and the arm leading to it forming a dead end, the water must be more or less stagnant and become offensive on very hot days, although I have been unable to verify such a condition, but in order to avoid offensiveness arising, I have suggested— Firstly—The basin should be dredged at regular intervals, Secondly—That an overflow should be constructed at the southern end, covered by a grating, which would allow of a slow but constant change of surface water and removal of surface scum, and also attract and arrest the larger jetsam, which could be collected from the grating at regular and frequent intervals. Thirdly—That if a further step were necessary, the sluice valve should be opened when there is abundance of water, and not remain so long closed as at present. On Friday, 22nd May, 1891, I traversed that portion of the Regent's Canal in St. Pancras, from Cumberland Basin to Battle Bridge, accompanied by Inspector Fulton. About half-way up the Cumberland Arm, some jetsam, &c., was floating on the surface. Nothing further was particularly observable until reaching Kentish Town Lock. From Kentish Town Lock to Pancras Lock the water had been run off, exposing the bed of the Canal. The following points were observed in traversing this portion of the Canal. A large accumulation of mud to the eastward of the Kentish Town Road Bridge, on both sides of the Canal—hundreds of tons—but especially opposite the Kentish Town Wharf, smell offensive. An accumulation of mud lining both sides of the Canal, between Camden Street and Camden Road Bridges, but especially at and opposite Bayham Wharf. An accumulation of mud between Great College Street and King's Road Bridges, mainly on the south side, at Bangor Wharf. An accumulation of mud on both sides of the Canal, above and below the bridge by Bass' Stores, especially inside the columns under the projecting building; the mud is a solid black mud, from 2 to 4 feet deep, except just in the middle of the Canal. 47 An accumulation of mud on both sides of the Canal from the Midland Main Line Railway Bridge, more or less down to Pancras Lock. The Midland Basin, which is entered at this point, contained thousands of tons of black mud ; some men were tickling this accumulation with the help of two barrows in one place, and a barge containing a small cart-load or so in another. This was about 2 p.m., and the water was to be re-admitted into this length of the Canal at 5 p.m. During the year the Conference of Delegates appointed in 1891 by the Vestries of St Marylebone, St. Pancras, and Paddington, in reference to the condition of the Regent's Canal, pursued its enquiry, and on ths 25th May, 1892, inspected the canal and basins from Maiden Lane Bridge to Kensal Green. The following were the results of the inspection in St. Pancras:— The mud was measured by means of a rod in different places, and it was noted that there were 18-in. of mud at the Gas Works Lay-bye, 2-ft. at the entrance of the Great Northern Basin, decreasing in the centre to 6-in., 2-ft. of mud opposite the stables of the Gas Works and 1-ft. 6-in. of mud in the Great Northern Basin. The mud in the basin, south side of the Midland Railway, varied from 1-ft. 3-in. to 2-ft. 10-in. At the King's Road Bridge, Bangor Wharf, the mud varied from 2-ft. 6-in. to 5-ft. 3-in. in depth. In Cumberland Basin the mud was from 1-ft. 6-in. to 2-ft. Almost in all places in these basins where goods were being transferred or where works abutted on the Canal, there was more or less solid or liquid pollution caused by dirty liquid from the surface, or solid matters blown in by the wind, or conveyed by overflows, or accident, as e.g., leakages from the surface of the Stable Yard, adjoining the Great Northern Railway Bridge to the Coal Sidings, and the same thing at Camden Road Bridge Wharf. The dead animals floating in the St. Pancras portion of the Canal, were found, when looked for, in all parts, the number reached its maximum in Cumberland Arm and Basin, where about thirty were enumerated. As to drains from houses entering the Canal, the St. Pancras Surveyor, Mr. Blair, expressly states that:—"The inspection of the Canal made on the 25th inst., did not show that there is discharged into the Canal throughout its length in the Parish of St. Pancras, any sewage matter likely to cause pollution in the Canal beyond in the few cases where water from the surface of the ground was polluted by the drainage from manure heaps, and such cases could be dealt with bv the Vestry as nuisances. There are many pipes discharging roof water and surface water from gardens or yards, but these can scarcely be regarded as causing pollution to the Canal, and there are pipes discharging condensed water from engines or the water blown off from boilers, but these also are unobjectionable. 48 One pipe discharging into the branch on the South side of the Canal, near Maiden Lane Bridge, was found to receive the waste pipe of a bath used by a few of the employees at the Gas Works, and on the fact being mentioned to the manager, he agreed at once to divert the bath-waste into the Company's drains if called upon to do so." In June the Conference concluded the enquiry by framing the following recommendations:— (1) We are of opinion that the three Vestries of St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and Paddington should, each in their respective districts, take proper measures to prevent objectionable, solid, or liquid substances from fouling the Canal, and to prohibit the discharge into the Canal of all drains and drainage other than unpolluted surface water. There seems to be ample powers for this action, aud tho 120th Section of the "Public Health (London) Act" also provides against nuisances, wholly or partially caused by the acts or defaults of two or more persons, even should the act or default of any one of such persons not in itself be a nuisance. (2) W ith regard to the Zoological Gardens, seeing that, at present, there is no public sewer available for the gardens to be drained into, that a sewer be constructed, that the Crown and the Zoological Society be requested to join with the Vestries of St. Pancras and St. Marylebone in the expense, and that the Society be required to connect all their drains with the said sewer. (3) The Vestries should request the London County Council to make bye-laws pursuant to section 16 of the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," in relation to offensive cargoes and the transport thereof. (4) The Canal Companies should be required by the Vestries to systematically scavenge the surface of the Canals and the banks thereof, three times a week on alternate days throughout the months of June, July and August, aud twice a week throughout the other months of the year. (5) The Canal Companies should be required to scavenge the bottom of the whole of the Canals, including the basins and lay-byes, annually, removing the mud and other deposit therefrom, by dredging or other effective means. (6) That the Canal Companies be required to concrete parts of the Canals, such as basins, lay-byes and places adjacent to wharves, where mud and other deposits are likely to accumulate. (7) That, in addition to the existing overflows at Paddington basin, an overflow should be constructed by the Canal Company, at the southern end of the Cumberland Market basin so as to change the water instead of its being allowed to stagnate as at present, and when water is abundant the existing sluice valves in the basins should be opened far more often than hitherto. 49 Your Vestry decided to issue a Statutory Notice and a notice was accordingly served upon the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company in November, to the following effect:— 1.—To forthwith properly cleanse and scavenge the surface of so much of the Regent's Canal and the hanks thereof as lie within the said Parish of St. Pancras, and henceforth to do so three times a week, on alternate days, throughout the months of June, July, and August in each year, and twice in each week throughout the other remaining months in each year. 2.—To forthwith cleanse and scavenge the bottom of so much of the said Canal as aforesaid, including the lay-byes and basins thereof, and to that end to clear away and remove therefrom the mud and all other deposits, by dredging, or other effective means, and henceforth to perform these and any other necessary works once in each year. 3.—To concrete such parts of so much of the said Canal as aforesaid, including the basins and lay-byes, and other places adjacent to wharves as are likely to allow mud and other deposits to accumulate. 4.—To construct an overflow at the southern end of Cumberland Market Basin, so as to change water in such basin and prevent stagnation thereof.

The new organization is based upon a system for the removal of dust once a week from every house in the District, this being effected by causing the collecting carts to make a weekly call from house to house in every street, square, or other p'.ace. For this purpose the whole District has been divided into small areas, the Parliamentary Divisions (4), and Sub-Divisions (20) having been adopted, and every Monday morning in each Sub-Division an additional dust cart commences to collect, in accordance with a printed street-list from house-to-house and street-to-street consecutively until the Sub-Division is completed, so that whatever length of time a cart takes to complete a Sub-Division it is followed by another at an interval of not longer than one week. When a cart has completed a Sub-Division, it recommences the printed street-list on the following Monday morning, and in the meantime if not engaged for other purposes, may join with any other cart in a Sub-Division and work in co-operation and currently with it until the end of the week to keep it employed. The effectual working of the system is brought about by insisting upon a fresh cart commencing the Sub-Division, in accordance with the street-list, every Monday morning, and not permitting any cart to commence independently on any other day of the week, nor at any point except the commencement of the street-list, otherwise the system is inevitably thrown into confusion. If an additional cart is " put on," it must not be allowed to work independently, but must work in co-operation and concurrently with some other cart, so that the supplementary cart does not disturb the order of collection, nor unduly curtail or prolong the intervals. 51 The effect of the system is not seen in comparing the two years 1891 and 1892 in which the dust complaints numbered respectively 14,634 and 10,335, because the system was only brought irto working order in the second quarter of the year, but by comparing the last 6 months of the two years, the effect is brought into prominence. Number of Dust Complaints. July. Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. Total foe the Six Months. 1891 1414 788 860 761 1109 1701 6663 1892 4 8 14 4 25 9 64 The number of complaints in January, February, and March, 1893, when the contracts terminated, were 15, 12, and 22. respectively, and in April, May, and June, when the new contracts commenced, they were 32, 30, and 8. These figures prove incontestably that the system is an unqualified success. NUISANCES. Dead Animals.—The Table 9a in the Appendix records the number and kinds of nuisances abated during the year, but one particular kind of nuisance, namely dead animals, does not appear there. In towns there are always present a large number of small animals, especially cats and dogs. When these animals die or are killed, paved streets and paved yards offer no facilities for their interment. Furthermore, many live domestic animals fall into such a state of health or become so numerous as to require to be destroyed, and householders have great difficulty in destroying them as well as in disposing of the carcases. Poisoning, hanging, and drowning the animals, and casting the bodies into the canals, roadways, an i vacant spaces are the usual means resoited to, and give rise to many minor nuisances. It may be worth the consideration of your Vestry to set apart some place where these animals might be painlessly put out of existence and their bodies disposed of without nuisance. This would tend to prevent the accumulation of large numbers of dead animals in the Regent's Canal, on vacant spaces, and in the thoroughfares, &c., and be a great boon to perplexed ratepayers. V.—FOOD. FOOD PREMISES. The Slaughter-houses. No contravention of the Rye-laws has been recorded. The Cowsheds have also been kept in compliance with the Regulations. The Dairies and Milkshops, as to the storage of milk, are controlled by the County Council. The Bakehouses have been inspected and the usual cleansing enforced under the Factory and Workshop Acts. The Fish-frying Shops have been from time to time inspected, and in one instance an alleged nuisance has been abated by the enlargement of the fire hood and the lengthening of the chimney by a tall-boy. 52 UNFIT FOOD.
