LIBRARY GRE 38 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF GREENWICH ABRIDGED REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1940. F. R. WALDRON, M.D., D.P.H., Health Department, Town Hall, Greenwich, S.E.10. September, 1941. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Boroughof Greenwich. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report for the year 1940. In accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Health, it again presents in an abridged form a summary of the work performed by the various sections of the department. The fact that the incidence of infectious diseases has been extremely low is a matter for gratification, especially in view of the adverse circumstances during the latter part of the year. The birth rate (15.7 per 1,000) was somewhat above that for London as whole, and the death rate (17,5 per 1,000) considerably higher than usual, due to the inclusion in the figure, of deaths through enemy action. The infantile mortality rate was 56 per 1,000 births. The Registrar General's estimate of the population, namely 74,280 is a decrease of 20,510. In view of the fact that the population must be regarded as fluctuating during the year, it is difficult to present conclusive statistics. The work of the District Sanitary Inspectors was necessarily restricted, and towards the end of the year was mainly concentrated on the many problems arising from war damage. Notwithstanding the many difficulties, the routine sampling of food and drugs has been carried out systematically, and every effort has been made to maintain a high standard as regards sanitary circumstances generally. Up to September, the Antenatal and Infant Welfare Centres functioned normally, though on a restricted basis, because of the evacuation of mothers and children. The Maternity Home, being still closed, the 'Home Helps' scheme was utilised on an increasing scale. Throughout the year, the volume of work entailed in Air Raid Precautions, markedly increased. In July, a Welfare Centre, which had been used as a Stretcher Party Depot, was again put into service, and the Unit was re-housed in new quarters. By September, the various aspects of the casualty services were consolidated, and reorganised. Owing to the calling up of personnel, and necessary continued recruitment, training had to be maintained in order to keep the services up to the desired state of efficiency. I should like to take the opportunity of again expressing my warm appreciation of the very efficient manner in which the members of my staff have carried out their onerous and responsible duties. Finally, I desire to thank the Chairman and members of the Public Health and Maternity Committee for the consideration shown to me during the past year. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, F.R. WALDRON STATISTICS As in the previous year local statistics in regard to Births & Deaths are affected, chiefly owing to considerable Proportions of the population being evacuated to reception areas. It should be recorded also that non-civilian deaths i.e. all males serving in H.M. Forces are not now included. POPULATION (Registrar General's.

Much additional work wasundertaken by the Health Visitors in connection with the evacuation of expectant mothers to reception areas and n lso in connection with vhe introduction of the National Milk Scheme.

The number of children on the Register was 25. Periodical visits were made by the Health Visitors who act as Child Protection Visitors. Home Helps In connection with the Council's Maternity & Child Welfare Scheme, Home Helps were provided at a net cost to the Council of Â£103.14.11d. Foot Clinics Despite curtailed sessions during the winter months, the attendances have been well up to the average, the number being 3745 Supply of Milk to Mothers & Children The total amount supplied during the year was:- Pkts. Dried Milk (a) distributed free 13903 " " (b) sold at full or reduced prices 12444 Liquid Milk (a) and (b) gallons National Milk Scheme About the middle of the year the National Milk Scheme was introduced by the Ministry of Food and provided for fresh milk to be available for mothers and young children either free, or at half price if the income scale exceeded a certain standard. Provision was made for dried milk to be available for babies up to the age of one year where such was advised on medical grounds. The Scheme naturally ran on somewhat similar lines to the Council's own Maternity and Child Welfare organisation, and for this reason the administration thereof was referred to the Department, the Medical Officer of Health being provisionally appointed Milk Officer. Some 3,000 applications were receivedin respect of the first quarter. The work considerable demands upon both the clerical staff in carrying out the necessary clerical work the Health Visitors in connection with verifying particulars a nd authorising supplies. Towards the end of the year, arrangements wore made for the National Milk Scheme to be transferred to the Food Control Department, co-operation with the Welfare Centres continuing in respect of distribution of dried milk etc. Convalescent Treatment Owing to war conditions, a number of the coastal Convalescent Homes were closed down and where possible were re-opened in safer areas.

As a result of advice given 79 improvements to premises were carried out. Numerous visits were made at premises damaged by enemy action with a view to arranging for the salvage of foods at such premises. IMPORTED FOOD SURRENDERED Total Amount - 2 tons 15 cwt. 1 qr. 2 lbs. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS 29 samples of milk, including 22 from local hospitals and schools were submitted. With one exception all were found to comply with the standards required. EXAMINATION FOR PRESENCE OF T. B. One sample of milk was examined for presence of tuberclebacilli and was found to be free from infection." FOOD & DRUGS ACT 1938 During the year 415 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis Of these 158 were "formal" and 257 "informal". The chief article sampled was milk, 11 out of 111 samples were adulterated. PREVALENCE & CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASE The total number of infectious diseases was 501 which is easily the lowest on record. Even allowing for the fact that a large proportion of the child population have been evacuated to evacuation areas, it is still difficult to understand the low incidence generally, having regard to the abnormal conditions under which families were living during the latter half of the year.
