On the 3rd December, 1895, in accordance with notice previously given, Mr. Vice- chairman Bisley moved:— "That it is desirable and expedient in the interests of the poor of this Parish that the income arising from the rent of the Poor Land, paid by the Guardians of the Poor to the Parish of Rotherhithe for the Infirmary and Workhouse, Lower Road, and by them paid to account in reduction of the Poor Rate, be inquired into by the Vestry, and to ascertain if such income cannot be applied to such purposes as the original donors of the lands aforesaid intended, and that the Clerk in the meantime furnish all the documents necessary." This was seconded by Mr. J. Brown, and carried, and Resolved accordingly. Public Libraries Act. At a meeting of the Vestry, held 1st October, 1895, Messrs. George Mabbs, Edward James Talbot, and Hugh Young, were elected Commissioners for Public Libraries and Museums in this Parish for the ensuing three years. The names of the Commissioners are as follows (the same being divided into three classes as provided by the Act):— 1st Class.—Offices to be vacated October, 1896: The Rev. Canon Beck, M.A., J.P. (Chairman), Mr. Charles Jollands Thompson, and Mr. Francis Thomas Talbot. 2nd Class.

Librarian, HERBERT ARCHER SHUTTLEWORTH. 35 The following is a copy of the Report of the Commissioners for the year ended 25th March, 1896. PARISH OF ST. MARY, ROTHERHITHE, LONDON, S.E. Fifth Report of the Commissioners for Public Libraries and Museums, 1895-96. In presenting this, the Fifth Annual Report, covering the period from March 26th, 1895, to March 25th, 1896, the Commissioners have much pleasure in reporting that steady progress, and continued public appreciation, has been made in all departments of the Library during the year. The most important event to be recorded is the opening of a Branch Delivery Station at Rotherhithe Street, S.E. This Station was opened on Monday, March 9th, 1896, and has fully justified the call for such a branch. The Commissioners were desirous of providing for the intellectual necessities of this district, and readily adopted the scheme drawn up by the Librarian, which up to the present is working admirably. It will be seen by the statistics that the attendance in the News Room, Ladies' Reading Room, etc., has increased considerably during the year; several new papers have been added to the list, and appear to ba very popular among the readers. The posting of the "Situations Vacant" advertisement sheets of the daily papers on a board outside the Library, from 8 to 9 in the morning, has also proved to be very much appreciated by persons seeking employment. 714 new volumes have been added during the year, of which 504 have been placed in the Lending Department, and 210 in the Reference Department, making the total number of books now in the Library 5185. 36 Among the principal gifts received are the following:- 88 volumes from the Clarendon Press, Oxford. Map of Rotherhithe in 1800. Rules and Regulations of the Rotherhithe Parish Protecting Society, held at the "China Hall" Inn, 1833. Historical notice of the Surrey Commercial Docks, 1844. Rate Receipt for half-year ending June, 1837, for the parish of Rotherhithe, London, presented by Mr. James J. Stokes. 37 volumes from Mr. J. R. Maylett. During the year 144 Catalogues have been sold. As upwards of 1800 books have been added to the Library since the printing of the Catalogue in 1800, a supplementary one is in course of preparation and will be published shortly. In September of last year, Mr. William Marillier, Librarian, was compelled through failing health to resign his position, much to the regret of the Commissioners, and Mr. Herbert Archer Shuttleworth, Librarian of the Deritend Branch Library, Birmingham, was appointed to the office. The Commissioners have every reason to be satisfied with the efficient manner in which Mr. Shuttleworth has carried out his duties since his appointment. The time allowed for reading the books has been revised as follows:—Classes E and J, seven days; A, B, C, D, F, G and H, fourteen days. Judging from the expression of the borrowers, this alteration appears to be greatly appreciated. 50 volumes of music have been added to the Library, including all the most popular operas, oratorios, etc. These are at present in great demand. The financial statement, and also statistics of Issues, Stock, Ages and Occupations of Borrowers, will be found on pages 38 to 43, and a careful perusal will give a fairly good insight into the work done, and the appreciation by the Public of this Library. The Commissioners beg to thank most heartily all those who have assisted by gifts, etc., the work of the Library during the past year.

The Surveyor was instructed to report upon the condition of such boundary stones. Bull Head Dock and the Victoria Oil Mills. In accordance with the instructions of the Vestry the Surveyor prepared and submitted two alternative schemes for the adaptation of the property to the requirements of the Vestry, viz:— Plan A.—Utilising as far as possible the existing buildings at an estimated cost of £12,815. Plan B.—Showing a complete set of new buildings at an estimated cost of £13,250. "\\ hich were referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report, and on 16th April, 1895, it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee— (1) That plan B be approved and adopted subject to the width of the Dock being increased to 50 feet at the coping at an estimated increase of £240. (2) That application be made to the London County Council for their sanction to borrow the sum of £14,090, being £13,490 the cost of the scheme, plus £600 the cost of widening Rotherhithe Street by setting back the frontage line to the line of the other buildings. (3) That the London County Council be now asked to lend the sum of £4,860 as an instalment of the said sum of £14,090, being the estimated cost of building the 49 River Wall, Docks, etc., and the widening of Rotherhithe Street, which work be proceeded with on receipt of the loan, subject to all necessary consents being obtained from the Thames Conservancy. To meet the objection of Mr. Bellamy, of the King and Queen Granaries, Rotherhithe Street, and of Messrs. G. & H. Green, of Surrey Commercial Wharf, the Surveyor was instructed to amend his plans by splaying off the river wall on either side:—against Mr. Bellamy's premises for a distance of about 15 feet, and against Messrs. Green's premises for about a distance of 20 feet. On 1st October, 1895, the Clerk was instructed to invite tenders by advertisement for the pulling down of the remainder of the buildings, and the clearance of the site.

Deane Sweeting, Esq., M.B., on behalf of the Local Government Board, and on 3rd December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board, enclosing the formal consents of that Board to the application of the Vestry for the borrowing of the sums of £520 for the provision of a disinfecting apparatus for a period of 20 years, and £50 for a Public Urinal for a period of 10 years. The consent of the Thames Conservancy being required for the erection of the new River Wall at Bull Head Dock, application was made' accordingly, and on the 17th July, 1895, a letter was received from Mr. J. H. Clutton, 9, Whitehall Place, stating that the Vestry's application had been referred to him as Assessor and that he proposed viewing the premises shortly and asking that instructions might be given for his admittance. On 29th July, 1895, a circular was received from the Secretary to the Thames Conservancy, stating there was a fee of £7 7s. due to the Assessor and a fine of £50 payable to the Conservators and stating that upon receipt of the money, permission would be given to commence the work, and On 7th October, 1895, the Secretary to the Thames Conservancy forwarded the License Deed and Duplicate in respect of the proposed embankment, the terms of which were as under:— 1.

The Clerk was authorised to affix the Common Seal of the Vestry to the Duplicate License and return same to the Conservators. On 5th November, 1895, the Vestry approved the plans, drawing, specification, conditions and quantities for the erection of River Walls, Dock and Slop Shoots prepared by the Surveyor, ordered the quantities to be printed, and instructed the Clerk to invite tenders by advertisement in the usual papers in due course.

Adams, of Green Lanes Goods Station, Wood Green, at the sum of £3,728 15s. l1d. be accepted, subject to his sureties being found satisfactory, to the Bill of Quantities being properly filled in, and to his entering into the necessary Contract for the due execution of the work to be prepared by the Clerk, and that the Common Seal of the Vestry be affixed to the Contract. (2) That Mr. Adams be requested to start the work immediately after the Christmas recess. The Contract was subsequently duly entered into by Mr. Adams and the work commenced at the beginning of the year 1896. A Committee consisting of the whole of the Members of the Vestry was appointed to watch the progress of the works. On 18th February, 1896, the Committee reported having inspected the works at Bull Head Dock which they found progressing satisfactorily, that their attention had been called to the fact that the ballast at the South East corner of the Dock appeared to be of a lower depth than had been anticipated, and that to insure a good foundation it would be necessary to go to the ballast if possible, that the maximum depth of the ballast at the river front was found to be 23 feet below the level of the new coping upon which depth the Contract had been based, but that the schedule of prices attached to the quantities governed the price to be paid for extra work. Resolved—That the Surveyor be authorised to instruct the Contractor to excavate in the Dock to a lower depth than that provided for in the Contract, if considered necessary by him, at the scheduled price. The Committee also reported that there are several piles in the old Dock upon the lines of the excavations for the new Dock Walls. Lesolved That if they are well set in the ballast, they be left to stand at the discretion of the Surveyor. The Committee also reported that the Surveyor had to satisfy the requirements of the Floods Department of the London County Council, constructed a timber tide board inside 53 the fencing so as to obvlate any risk of overflowing of the Thames into the street during the construction, and until the completion of the new Dock Walls. This was approved by the Vestry. Resolved—That the Dust Destructor, Chimney Shaft, and other adjoining building's comprise the next Contract, and that to enable the Vestry to decide upon the best and most approved pattern a Sub-Committee be appointed to inspect recently erected Dust Destructors in the Metropolis and Provinces, and report to the Vestry thereon. Resolved—That the Sub-Committee consist of the undermentioned gentlemen:- Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley Mr. Stuart Mr. F. T. Talbot Mr. Kimber Mr. Moss Mr. Vezey And the Surveyor. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. Burial Grounds and Churchyards. Holy Trinity. On 2nd July, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Chairman of the Metropolitan Public Gardens, Boulevard, and Playground Association, enquiring whether the Vestry could see its way to accept charge of Holy Trinity Churchyard, when it was resolved to forward a copy of the letter to the London County Council requesting them to take the matter into their favourable consideration. On 3rd March, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council stating that the Council had decided to undertake the maintenance of Holy Trinity Churchyard until the 31st October, 1896, at an estimated expenditure of £66. The letter was referred to the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church. St. Mary's. A letter having been received from the Burial Ground Trustees, drawing attention to the condition of the wall in the rear of the houses Nos. 66 and 68, Rotherhithe Street, and asking the Vestry to have the same repaired and an iron fence erected thereon, so as to prevent any one trespassing in the Burial Ground, the estry Resolved on the 21st May, 1895, to repair the wall in question, and to erect an iron fence thereon. 54 By-Laws and Regulations. By-Laws. It will be remembered that during last year, By-laws were made by the Vestry in respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than two families, instead of in respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family as required by the Act, as the Vestry felt that so large a number of houses in the Parish being occupied by two families, the effect of making By-laws as required by the Act, would be to bring a large number of houses within their scope, which was not only unnecessary, but would inflict a hardship upon the occupiers thereof, and this was strongly urged upon the Local Government Board, but the By-laws as submitted to the Local Government Board by the Vestry, were not confirmed at the close of the last financial year. On 25th June, 1895, the following letter was received from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 25th Jane, 1895. Sir,— I am directed by the Local Government Hoard to advert to the By-laws proposed to be made by the Yestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than two families. The Board direct me to state that they would not raise any objection to the proposal of the Yestry to exempt from the operation of the By-laws, houses, the landlords of which reside therein, and let to one lodger only. But the terms of the By-laws seem to go beyond this, and to be such as to exempt from registration a house sub-let to two different families even where there was no resident landlord. The Board will be glad to receive the observations of the Vestry on this question. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, J. J. Stokes, Esq., (Signed) S. B. PROVIS, Vestry Clerk ot the Assistant Secretary. Parish of Rotherhithe. 55 To which the following reply was ordered to be sent— PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. 17th July, 1895. By-Laws re Houses Let in Lodgings. In reply to your letter of 25th June last, I am directed to point out to the Board that the Parish of Rotherhithe is peculiarly situated in respect to this matter, inasmuch as the Parish contains a very large number of houses occupied by two separate families, and therefore if such houses are to come within the scope of the By-laws—and the Vestry are of opinion that they should not—it would be impossible for this Vestry, without a large addition to the staff of Sanitary Inspectors, to properly carry such By-laws into effect. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, The Assistant Secretary, (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Local Government Board, Clerk to the Yestry. Whitehall, S.W. And on ] 9th October, 1895, a letter was received from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board, returning the draft By-laws as forwarded by the Vestry to the Local Government Boar l, showing alterations and additions made therein by the Board for the Vestry's approval, which were referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report. On 19th November, 1895, the Sanitary Committee reported having considered the amendments of the Local Government Board to the By-laws proposed to be made by the Vestry under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in respect to houses let in lodgings, when it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That By-laws be made by the Vestry, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family embracing the amendments of the Local Government Board, and that the Clerk be and he is hereby instructed to take the necessary steps to get the same allowed by the Local Government Board in accordance with the Act, and that the Common Seal of the Vestry be and is hereby ordered to be affixed thereto. 56 On 21st January, 1896—a letter was submitted from the Secretary of the Local Government Board, transmitting the By-laws made by the Vestry under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with reference to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family duly confirmed by the Board as under. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891.

Plans— Such notice must be accompanied by a plan drawn to a scale of not less than 16 feet to an inch, accompanied by a block plan, showing the locality of the intended works, drawn to a scale of not less than 44 feet to an inch. The plan must show as much detail of the house or premises proposed to be drained as is necessary to enable a judgment to be formed as to the efficiency of the intended drainage. It must also show the position of all water closets, sinks, bath wastes, etc., the lines of new drains with the sizes thereof to be shown in red, and any existing drains in blue upon the plan. 4. Sizes of Drains.—All horizontal main pipes shall have an internal diameter of 6 in. if of stoneware, and an internal diameter of 5 in. if of iron, and the connection with the foot of the soil pipe or trap of basin must be made with proper bends and taper pipes. For the drainage from areas, single water closets, sinks and subsidiary drains, 4 in. pipes may be used. 5. Gradient of Drains.—The whole of the available fall is to be made use of, excepting it can be shown that a steeper gradient than 1 in 20 would result therefrom, in which case the gradient may be broken at the point where the drain emerges into the street, and a steeper gradient adopted from the sewer to the line of the house. No drain to have a less fall than 1 in 50, unless special provision be made for an automatic flushing of the Irains by the adoption of an approved flushing syphon. 6. Separate connection to Sewer Jor each Building.—All new houses or buildings shall have a separate drain in connection with the sewer, unless otherwise sanctioned by the Vestry, and no drain shall be laid under any house or building should it be practicable to lay it outside the same, even though the length of drain may be increased or the fall less favourable.

Method of Jointing.— All pipes must be laid with watertight joints upon cement concrete, and where they pass underneath or near to buildings they must, if of stoneware, be surrounded with not less than G in. of cement concrete in the proportions of two parts of clean sharp sand, four parts of clean ballast and one part of Portland cement, all by measure; where the covering of pipes beneath any building is less than one foot, iron pipes shall be used with lead and gaskin joints. 10. Junctions with Main Sewer.—The connection with the street sewer will be made by the Vestry at the owner's expense, including so much of the work as will be beneath the public way, and upon the estimated amount of same being paid by the applicant to the Surveyor to the Vestry. 11. No drain shall be laid on the premises until the drain from the sewer to the premises has been laid in accordance with the above regulation. 12. Ventilation.—For the effectual ventilation of the drains, at least two untrapped openings shall be provided: — (a) One opening, being at or near the level of the surface of the ground, communicating with the drains by means of a suitable pipe, shaft, or disconnecting chamber, as near as practicable to the trap, which shall be provided between the main drain of the building and the sewer with which such drain communicates; such opening shall be situate on that side of the trap nearer the building, and fitted with a mica valve. (b) The second opening shall be obtained by carrying up from the point or head of the drains farthest distant from the first mentioned opening, an iron ventilating pipe not less than three inches internal diameter, fitted with perfectly tight joints and wire guard covering at top, carried up to such a height as to be not less than 3 ft. above any window within 20 ft. of the same, and in such a manner as effectually to prevent any escape of foul air from such pipe or shaft into any building in the vicinity thereof. 13. Disconnecting Drainage.—A suitable trap must be provided in every main drain which directly communicates with the sewer at a point as distant as may be practicable from the building, 69 within the cartilage thereof, and as near a, may be practicable to the point at which such drain may be connected with the sewer.

The waste pipes should be protected by a syphon or other suitable trap to prevent a current of air passing through the pipe into the interior of the house. "Bell" traps will on no account be allowed. 17. Soil Pipes.—Soil pipes placed vertically shall be of cast iron, not less than ¼ in. thick, coated inside and outside with Dr. Angus Smith's patent varnish and jointed with molten lead and gaskin, or of drawn lead, weighing not less than seven lbs. per square foot.

"D" traps, containers, receivers, and hopper-shaped pans cannot be permitted. Where a series of water closets arc placed one above the other, delivering into a common soil pipe, the traps of each closet basin must be specially ventilated to prevent syphonage by means of a two-inch lead pipe turned into the main ventilation pipe, at a point above the highest water closet connected with such soil pipe. Great care must be taken that the connection between the water closet apparatus and the syphon, and the joint of the syphon with the drain or soil pipe are both made sound and air and water tight, and with such materials as are not likely to contract or expand or be affected by the urine passing over them into the drain or soil pipe. 19. Rain Water.—No rain water will be allowed to deliver on to the footways; water from the roofs, bay windows, cornices, etc., must be taken into the system of house drainage, or it may, with the consent of the Vestry, be passed into the street channel by means of cast iron gutter pipes of an improved pattern laid across, and with their top side level with the pavement of the footway. 20. Overflow Pipes.—Overflow pipes from all cisterns, service boxes, "safes," etc., must discharge if practicable, direct into the open air, or be carried by means of lead or other suitable pipes to a properly trapped gulley or syphon. 21. Notice of the intention to build new or alter existing premises, or reconstruction or alteration of drains, with a plan of the same (forms to be obtained at the Vestry Offices), shall be deposited with the Surveyor to the Vestry, showing the proposed drainage works; and no part of such drainage shall be laid until the plan has been approved by him, nor shall any portion thereof be covered up or filled in until it has been inspected and passed by the said Surveyor or his Inspector. NOTE. The above mentioned Rules and Regulations must be read in conjunction with the By-laws made under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by the London County Council. On 5th November, 1895, Mr. Stuart, in accordance with notice given at the previous meeting, moved that the whole of the existing Regulations and Resolutions of the Vestry relating to drainage bo rescinded, and that the Regulations as submitted by the Sanitary Committee, of 9th October, 1895, be substituted therefor. This was seconded by Mr. Bisley and carried unanimously, and Resolved accordingly. 71 Officers.

It will be remembered that last year a Conference of Vestries and District Boards was convened by the Holborn District Board of Works to consider what action could be taken to obtain an alteration of the law with regard to Combined Drainage, and that Messrs. F. T. Talbot and Moss, with the Surveyor, attended as representing this Vestry, at which it was resolved to send a deputation to the Council upon the subject. The deputation were subsequently received, when the Main Drainage Committee promised to give the matter full consideration, with the view of bringing in a Bill to amend the law with reference to Combined Drainage, and on the 14th May a letter was received from the Clerk to the Holborn District Board of Works, the Honorary Secretary to the Conference, stating that an intimation had reached him from the Clerk to the London County Council that the Council had adopted a recommendation of their Main Drainage Committee to apply to Parliament for an amendment of the definition of the words "sewer" and "drain," in the Metropolis Local Management Acts, in the way desired by the Local Authorities, and had instructed the Parliamentary Committee to prepare a Public Bill, and take such other steps as might be necessary for that purpose. On 2nd July, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Honorary Secretary to the Conference, stating that the Conference would reassemble at the Holborn Town Hall on Thursday, the 11th July, 1895, at 2 o'clock, to consider the suggestion recently submitted by the London County Council to the Local Authorities, and requesting that the delegates appointed by the Vestry might be in attendance, when it was resolved that Messrs. F. T. Talbot and R. W. Moss, together with the Clerk, attend the Conference on behalf of the Vestry. The suggestion referred to above is contained in the following letter from the Clerk to the London County Council, dated 29th May, 1895:- 76 Spring Gardens, S.W. 29th May, 1895. Sir, The Parliamentary Committee of the Council have before them an instruction to prepare a public Bill for the amendment of the definition of the words sewer and drain in the Metropolis Management Act in the way desired by the local authorities. A Bill has been drafted and laid before the Committee, but it has been suggested that the desired end might be obtained in another way, viz., by adding after the last words "district board" in section 250 of the Local Management Act, 1855, the words "or constructed at the expense of the owner without such order." The Parliamentary Committee are desirous of ascertaining the views of the local authorities upon this suggestion, and I am directed to request you to be good enough to let me hear from you on the subject at your early convenience. I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, H. DE LA HOOKE, Clerk of the Council. To the Clerk to the Vestry of Rotherhithe. On the llth July, 1895, the Conference met for the third time, and the following Resolutions were passed:— "That in the opinion of this Conference the suggestion contained in the letter of the London County Council under date 29th May, 1895, does not meet with the requirements of the local authorities of the Metropolis with reference to the proposed amendment of the law as regards Combined Drainage, inasmuch as it would be impossible in many cases to prove that a combined drain had been constructed at the expense of the owner." "That having regard to the fact that the draft Bill prepared by the London County Council had not been communicated to the local authorities, this meeting do now adjourn until some other suitable time, and that in the meantime the Secretary be instructed to supply the delegates with copies of the drft." 77 The following is a copy of the draft Bill prepared by the London County Council a BILL to Amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers. Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: 1. For the purpose of this Act "a private sewer" means a sewer so constructed as to be capable of receiving drainage from more than one house, but which has not been constructed by the Local Authority and has not been sanctioned and approved, as provided by sections 47 and 48 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1832, and the expression "Local Authority " means any Vestry or District Board acting under the Metropolis Management Acts, and includes the Woolwich Local Board. 2. Subject to the provisions of this Act, every provision of the Metropolis Management Acts relating to a drain shall be deemed to extend to a private sewer. 3. Any Local Authority may recover any expenses incurred by them in cleansing, maintaining, repairing, or replacing any private sewer from the owner or owners of any premises for the drainage of which such sewer is or may be used in such proportions, if there be more than one such owner, as may be settled by the Surveyor of the Local Authority, or in case of dispute by the London County Council. Any such expenses may be recovered summarily in the same manner as the expenses of making and paving new streets are authorised to be recovered under the .Metropolis Management Acts. For the purpose of examining any private sewer or of doing any work neeessary for the cleansing, maintenance, repair, or replacing of any such sewer, a Local Authority or their Surveyor or Inspector or such other person as they appoint shall have the like powers as are contained in section 82 of the Metropolis Management Act of 1855 in regard to drains. 78 4. This Act shall not apply to any expenses incurred by a Local Authority before the passing thereof, but shall apply to expenses incurred after the passing thereof in the case of any private sewer whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. 5. This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1895, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Amendment Acts. NOTE BY THE PARLIAMENTARY AGENT. Under the above heading the Council has passed the following resolution:— "That the Council do apply to Parliament for an amendment of the definition of the words sewer and drain in the Metropolis Local Management Act in the way desired by the local authorities and that it be referred to the Parliamentary Committee to prepare a Public Bill and take such steps as may be necessary for that purpose." The proposal referred to originated I believe with the Vestry Clerk of Islington, and received a large measure of support amongst the Vestries and District Boards of London. I have several times reported on the difficulty, in my opinion, of dealing with the matter in accordanc3 with the above resolution. I submitted to the Parliamentary Committee at the last meeting the draft of a Bill which had been suggested by the Yestry Clerk of Islington, which was discussed by the Committee. Suggestions were made as to its revision. I have revised the Bill accordingly, and present it herewith. 21st May, 1895. H. L. CRIPPS. On 12th October, 1895, a letter was received from the Hon. Secretary to the Conference re Combined Drainage, stating that the Conference would assemble for the fourth time on Wednesday, 30th October, 1895, at the Holborn Town Hall, and requesting the attendance thereat of the delegates appointed by the Vestry. Resolved That the delegates already appointed be requested to attend such Conference. 79 The Conference subsequently met, and the following Resolutions were passed:- "That in the opinion of the Conference the following Clause based upon the Resolution passed by the Conference at its first Meeting in May, 1894. should be substituted for Clauses 1 and 2 of the draft Bill:- The word drain should be deemed to apply to, and include the subject matters specified in the 250th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and in the 112th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862, and also any drain the plan of which has not been approved as a sewer under Section 69 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855; and Section 45 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, Amendment Act, 1862, or under Section 48 of the latter Act." "That Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill be adapted so as to apply to a drain for draining any group or block of houses by a combined operation." "That a Committee of seven be appointed to consider the Bill and settle a draft in accordance with the terms of the resolution previously passed, with power to submit the same to the London County Council. In pursuance of permission granted at the last meeting, the delegates from the Vestry of St. Pancras, moved and seconded:— "That the London County Council be recommended to consider the following Clause as an addition to the proposed Bill 'Before making any drain and before re-laying, re-constructing, amending or otherwise interfering with any existing drain, notice in writing shall be given to the Vestry or District Board by the person intending to make such drain, or to interfere with any existing drain and before making any drain or altering the level or course of, or making any addition to or extending or curtailing any existing diain or any branch drain, a plan of the proposed diain and any exiting drain shall be deposited with the Vestry or District Board by the person intending to make such drain or to alter or extend or curtail any existing drain.'" 80 Resolved.-That the question raised by the motion be referred to the Committee just appointed, with power to make any suggestions they think necessary on the subject. The meeting then closed. On 3rd December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Islington, forwarding copy letter addressed by that Vestry to the London County Council, as under — Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., 19th November, 1895. Sir, I am directed by this Vestry to inform the London County Council that it has given very careful consideration to the Bill drafted by the Council's Parliamentary Agent during the course of last session for the amendment of the Metropolis Management Acts with regard to sewers and drains, as also to a Bill with similar objects drafted at the instance of a Conference of Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards ; and that it is of opinion that the latter is preferable as a means of obtaining the relief sought by the drainage authorities, inasmuch as it not only avoids the introduction of a term ("private sewer") hitherto unknown to the Metropolis Management Acts (the use of which moreover would render necessary also an amendment of the Public Health [London] Act, 1891), but follows the course of legislation pursued in connection with the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, when it was found necessary after seven years' experience to first extend (retrospectively) the definition of the word "drain." My Vestry desires therefore to urge upon the London County Council that it should adopt the Bill drafted on behalf of the Conference subject to such amendments as its Parliamentary Agent may think desirable, and trusts that it will use every means in its power to secure the passing of the same during the ensuing session of Parliament. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WM. F. DEWEY, H. De la Hooke, Esq., Vestry Clerk London County Council. 81 and asking this Vestry to make a similar representation to the Council, and also to request its representative to support the measure when introduced into Parliament. Resolved.—That this Vestry take similar action. The following is a copy of a Bill which was ultimately brought in by Col. Hughes, and which is in accordance with the views of the Conference:— Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. MEMORANDUM. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, under which the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis have to act, does not contain any definition of the word "drain," and the old definition in the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, is found to be defective and has led to conflicting decisions; this Bill, the result of a Conference of the Local Authorities, is to remedy the defect. A BILL to Amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:— 1. In the construction of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1890, and the Acts amending the same, the word 'drain' shall be deemed to apply to and include any drains of and used for the drainage of one building only or premises within the same curtilage, and made merely for the purpose of communicating with a cesspool or other like receptacle for drainage, or with a eewer into which the drainage of two or more buildings or premises occupied by different persons is conveyed, and shall also include any drain for draining any group or block of houses by a combined operation pursuant to the order or direction or with the sanction or approval of the 82 Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, or under the order of any Vestry or District Board, and shall also include any drain which has not been approved as a sewer either by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers or by the Metropolitan Board of Works or the London County Council. 2. Any Local Authority may recover any expenses incurred by them in cleansing, repairing or replacing any drain for draining any group or block of houses from the Owner or Ownersof any premises for the drainage of which such drain is or may be used in such proportions, if there be more than one such Owner, as may be settled by the Surveyor of the Local Authority, or in case of dispute by the London County Council. Any such expenses may be recovered from the present or any future Owner of the premises either by action in the High Court or before a court of summary jurisdiction. 3. This Act shall not apply to any expenses incurred by a local authority before the passing thereof, but shall apply to expenses incurred after the passing thereof in the case of any drain for draining any group or block of houses whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. 4. The expression "Local Authority" as used in this Act means any Vestry or District board of orks under the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1890, and the Acts amending the same, or in the Parish of Woolwich the Woolwich Local Board of Health. 5. This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1896, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1890, and the Acts amending the same. The Bill had not readied its second rending at the close of the year. 83 Conferences. Local Government. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council, stating, that by direction of the Council, the Local Government and Taxation Committee of the Council had arranged for a Conference to take place at the County Hall at 3 p.m., on Friday, the 31st January, between the Representatives of the Council and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis to consider and report what powers then possessed by the Council, should be transferred to the Local Authorities and requesting that this Vestry would nominate two Representatives and the Clerk to attend, and asking to be informed of the names and addresses of such Representatives. Resolved—That Messrs. F. J. Bisley (Vice-Chairman), and F. T. Talbot, and the Clerk attend the Conference on behalf of the Vestry. Several meetings were held", but the Minutes of the Conference are too voluminous to reproduce here. Local Taxation.

At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Benn, M.P., undertook to move for the return. Votes of thanks to the Westminster Vestry, Mr. Hayter, and the noble Chairman, concluded the proceedings of the Conference. In reply to the request made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by order of the Conference, a letter has been received as follows:— " Malwood, 6th June, 1895. "Sir, I am desired by Sir William Harcourt to say that he has informed Lord Onslow that he will be happy, on his return to London, to see not more than six gentlemen on the subject to which your letter of the 30th refers. Yours faithfully, L. V. HARCOURT. J. E. Smith, Esq." On 24th March, 1896, Mr. Beasley, one of the delegates, reported that the deputation had had an interview with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but that although the views expressed by the Conference had been ably laid before him, the Chancellor did not see his way to take any action in the matter. Naval Contracts. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk to the Limehouse District Board of Works, stating that that Board had had under consideration the desirability of an urgent appeal being made to Her Majesty's Government to give share of their Naval Contracts to East London Shipbuilding Firms, and had decided to 86 convene a Conference of Members of Parliament and of the London County Council, representing constituencies in the East and South-East of London, and of Representatives of District Boards, Vestries and Boards of Guardians in such localities, for the purpose of considering the matter, and inviting this Vestry to appoint three members to attend such Conference, to be held at the Limehouse Town Hall, on Thursday, 30th January, at 4 p.m. Resolved—That Messrs.

On 7th May, 1895, Mr. Vezey, reported that he again attended the Conference on Thursday, 2nd May, 1895, when it was resolved to send a deputation to the House of Commons and at his nomination, his colleague, Mr. Stuart, was appointed a delegate from the Conference. Unemployed. A letter having been received from the St. Olave's Guardians enclosing copy of a resolution passed by them as under:— "That a Conference of the Guardians and the Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Vestries and the St. Olave's District Board of Works be held to consider the question of making such arrangements for the execution of the necessary work required by such Boards during the period of winter when distress is most prevalent amongst the poorer classes, and further to consider the best means of preventing or alleviating such distress, and that the members of such Boards be invited to attend such Conference." The Vestry, on 16th July, 1895, appointed the undermentioned gentlemen to attend the Conference on their behalf:— Mr. Walter Beasley, Mr. R. L. Stuart, „ J. Brown, „ F. T. Talbot, „ F. Foster, „ H. Vezey, Mr. G. Wood. The Conference met at the Board Room, Tanner Street, on the 17th October, 1895, and the following resolutions were passed:— Resolved—1. "That this Conference is of opinion that the law should be so altered as to permit Boards of Guardians in cases of exceptional distress to make grants of money to District Boards and Vestries for the purpose of enabling such authorities to engage men in necessary and useful work in their Districts, who are unable to find employment at their ordinary avocations. 90 2 "That inasmuch as the causes of the want of employment arc national rather than local, this Conference is of opinion that it is inexpedient that isolated action should be taken by any particular Board of Guardians in the Metropolitan area, with the view of affording special relief to the Unemployed, and suggest that steps should at once be taken, with the assistance of the Local Government Board, with a view of agreeing on a common plan of action, should the necessity arise during the coming winter. 3. "That the Government be approached and asked to empower the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the Board of Agriculture to acquire waste and unused lands for the purpose of productively employing the Unemployed during the coming winter." 4. "That in the opinion of this Conference it is impossible to find proper work for the Unemployed, and therefore considers that a joint application of the various Boards of Guardians of the Metropolis should be made to the Local Government Board to permit the Guardians to give individual relief in exceptional times of distress without applying the Labour test." 5. "That the Government be asked to carry out the policy of Lord Salisbury's speech at Bradford, and to bring forward during the coming Session of Parliament, measures dealing with the question of the Unemployed." 6. "That the London School Board be asked to give out whatever work of School painting and repairing is possible during the Christmas holidays, when work in the various branches of the Building Trade is slackest." 7. "That a copy of the loregoing resolutions be sent to the Prime Minister, the President of the Local Government Board, the First Lord of the Treasury, the Colonial Secretary, the Home Secretary, the Boards of Guardians, Vestries, and District Boards of the Metropolis and the School Board for London." (See also Unemployed). 91 Drainage. Ainsty Street and Seth Street. On 31st May, 1895, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported as a matter of urgency the receipt by the Surveyor of a notice to redrain Nos. 63 to 73, Ainsty Street into the front sewer in accordance with the Vestry's regulations, and who reports that as the Vestry's sewer in the street does not reach so far as this property it would be necessary, if the property was required to redrain as shown in the notice, to extend the existing 12 inch pipe sewer as far as Seth Street, a distance of about 10 yards, and to construct about 20 yards of 9 inch pipe sewer in Seth Street, and that the Owner of the property having commenced the internal portion of the work, it is necessary that the outside work be immediately put in hand, and the Vestry Resolved—That the suggestion of the Surveyor be carried out at an estimated cost of £50. Chilton Street. Attention having been drawn to the defective state of the drainage at the rear of 08 and 70, Chilton Street, and the same having been inspected by the Sanitary Committee, the Vestry, on 2nd July, 1895, instructed the Surveyor to construct a 9 inch pipe extending along the backs of the houses in Chilton Street to Yeoman Place in lieu of the existing old sewer. Neptune Court. Notice having been received for the erection of four more houses in Neptune Court, extending from the previous four to Risdon Street, the Sanitary Committee inspected the spot, and found that the washhouses at the rear of the buildings were proposed to bo built over a sewer belonging to the Vestry approved by the late Metropolitan Board of Works in 185G, and consisting of a 9 inch pipe six feet deep, when it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that to enable the washhouse to be erected as shown, the sewer be taken up and relaid under the water closets at the rear of the said waslihouses, upon condition that the builder bears half the estimated cost thereof, amounting to £15. This the builder agreed to do upon condition that he would be allowed to drain his houses into it instead of going out into the front. 92 Resolved—That upon the builder submitting an amended plan of the drainage he be allowed to drain into the back sewer instead of the front. Nolan Place. Notice having been received for the re-drainage of the houses in Nolan Place which did not comply with the Vestry's regulations, and it being found upon examination that the only sewers near the property consisted of an 18 inch brick drain, crossing Hatteraick Street, and running between Adam Street and Adam's Gardens, and an old brick sewer crossing Tunnel Square and discharging into Swan Lane. The Vestry Resolved—That a 9 inch pipe be constructed down the centre of Nolan Place and Hatteraick Street, and that the houses on either side be required to drain into it in accordance with the Vestry's regulations. Renforth Street and Mary Street. On 11th June, 1895, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the drainage of stables corner of Renforth Street and Mary Street, that it appeared from the report of the Surveyor that, in the notice to build, the drainage was shown to come out into Renforth Street, in which at present there is no sewer, the nearest sewer being an old 18 inch brick culvert running along the bottom of this land against Messrs. Brandram's fence into Neptune Street, which takes the drainage of the East side of Renforth Street, and that the present end of the sewer in Renforth Street is opposite Risdon Street, to extend which to take the drainage in question in 12 inch pipes would cost about £50, and that the pipe should be continued to the end of the street to intercept the old culvert, and a branch taken along Mary Street to pick up the pipe that drains the houses upon the West side of Renforth Street and Mary Street, which at present crosses Mary Street, thence across the land into the old sewer at the back, and is at present full of silt, and broken in several places, which would cost a further sum of about £15. Resolved that the present sewer in Renforth Street be extended as far as Mary Street, in 12 inch pipes, and that a 9 inch pipe sewer be constructed in Mary Street from the end of the Proposed sewer in Renforth Street, so as to intercept the existing old pipe which at present crosses Mary Street, and discharges into the back sewer against Messrs. Brandram's fence, at an estimated cost of £70. 93 Slipper's Place and Moreton Terrace. Notice having been received for the building and drainage of three houses at the corner of Slippers Place and Moreton Terrace, showing the drainage to discharge into Slipper's Place, and it being found upon examination that the Vestry had no sewer there, nor one within 100 feet, the nearest being a 9 inch pipe inside or close to Park fence at the bottom of Moreton Terrace, which if extended to take in this property would be no further us», it was Resolved—To extend the 12 inch pipe which had recently been constructed from Union Road to opposite No. 510, Southwark Park Road, for about GO yards, so as to take in the property, at an estimated further cost of £65. Southwark Park Road, A notice having been received to drain a stable at 510, Southwark Park Road, the outlet being shown into Arica Place, Prospect Street, and the Surveyor reporting that there was no sewer in Arica Place other than a 9 inch pipe taking a gully half-way along the place, and that there was no sewer in Southwark Park Road opposite the property, and that to drain the stable as shown, and take the sewer to the boundary of the property, would require about 40 yards of 9 inch pipe with a man-hole in Prospect Street, and a flushing shaft or ventilator at one end, the matter was referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, and on 16th April, 1895, they reported as under:— "With reference to the notice received by the Surveyor to drain a stable at 510, Southwark Park Road, it appears the Vestry have no sewer in Arica Place other than a inch pipe taking a gully placed halfway along the place continuing to near the top where it is only - foot 2 inches deep, and contains 6 inches of silt, and which pipe has been examined and found to be very irregular in line and level, and that to drain the stable as shown (there being no sewer in Southwark Park Road opposite the property), about 40 yards of 9 inch pipe with a man-hole in Prospect Street and a flushing shaft or ventilator at the top, would he required, so as to bring the existing sewer in Arica Place to the boundary of the property; that having inspected the property they were of opinion that as the extension of the 9 inch pipe in Arica Place as mentioned would be of no 94 further use to the Vestry than to receive the drainage of Arica Place and the stable when brought to the front, it would be preferable to construct a sewer in Southwark Park Road, which they estimate to cost £125." Resolved-That a 12 inch pipe sewer be constructed in Southwark Park Road extending from Union Road to the gateway, 510, Southwark Park Road, into which the stable be required to drain. St. Marychurch Street. The owners of the "Ship" P.IL, St. Marychurch Street, having received notice of defective drainage and bad smells arising therefrom, commenced to trace the course of their drainage, and in doing so came across an old sewer running at the rear of the property. Tho attention of the Surveyor having been called to the same he caused an examination to be made of the sewer in question, and reported the result as under :— "I have examined the sewer and traccd its course by means of openings at various points. It discharges through a 12-inch pipe into the sewer in St. Marychurch Street, near the end of the Burial Ground, runs along the 'right of way' between the Burial Ground and No. 42, St. Marychurch Street, in a 2-feet culvert, which was clear at the point of inspection, thence under the scullery and wash-house of No. 42, after which it takes a sharp turn to the left and proceeds across the back gardens of the houses, receiving in due course the whole of the drainage from No. 42 to No. 64, St. Marychurch Street, including the cow house and the closets belonging to the "Ship" P.H., in the back yard of which it consists of a culvert about 4 feet high and 2 feet wide, with 2 feet 6 inches of silt therein and in No. 62, St. Marychurch Street, it is a 12-inch pipe. This sewer was constructed according to the old plans by the Commissioners of Sewers before the establishment of Vestries, and in my opinion there are three ways of dealing with the matter, viz.:— 1.- Thoroughly cleanse as soon as possible and leave it. 2. Thoroughly cleanse and substitute a 12 inch pipe surrounded with concrete for the old culvert, which would be abolished, or Abolish it entirely by transferring the existing drainage into the front sewer in St. Marychurch Street." 95 The Vestry, upon the recommendation of their Sanitary Committee, Resolved—To adopt the middle course, viz.: To thoroughly cleanse and substitute a 12 inch pipe surrounded with concrete for the old culvert, which would be abolished. Notices were accordingly served upon the Owners of Nos. 42 to 54, and 62 and 64, St. Marychurch Street, to reconstruct the drainage thereto. The Vestry subsequently received an intimation from the Owners that they would not object to transfer the existing drainage into the front sewer in St. Marychurch Street, provided the Vestry would meet them in the matter, but questioned the right of the Vestry to compel them to do so : the premises having for so many years been drained into the old sewer in the rear. The Clerk having advised the Vestry that the Owners having acquired an easement of drainage into the back sewer, it was doubtful whether they could be compelled to drain into the new sewer and that the Vestry might be called upon to reconstruct the back sewer. It was Besolved.—"With the view of abolishing whenever possible back drainage, to meet the Owners in the matter by putting in the new connections up to the fronts of the houses free of expense to the Owners, at an estimated cost of from £30 to £35, and that upon the existing drainage being transferred to the front sewer in St. Marychurch Street, the Surveyor be instructed to fill up and entirely abolish the old sewer at the back, and that the previous resolution of the Vestry in the matter be rescinded. The Clerk subsequently reported that he, with the Surveyor, had had an interview with Messrs. Still & Son (Solicitors for the Owners), upon the matter and had learnt that the estimate of Messrs. Stock, Page and Stock (the Owners' Surveyors) of the cost ol reconstruction amounted to considerably more than that of the Surveyor aiul that consequently there was a hitch in coming to an arrangement in the matter, when the following resolution was passed:— "That the matter be referred back to the Sanitary Committee for reconsideration and report, and that the Clerk in the meantime take counsel s opinion as to the power of the Vestry to compel the Owners to drain into the Vestry's sewer in St. Marychurch Street." 90 The opinion of Mr. Alexander Macmorran was obtained as under "I observe that the Surveyor in his report to the Vestry says that the old sewer at the back was constructed according to the old plans by the Commissioners previous to the establishment of Vestries. This is not a very clear statement. If it means that the old sewer was laid by the Commissioners of Sewers themselves, then it is undoubtedly a sewer; but if laid by private persons according to plans approved by the Commissioners, then it is a drain and not a sewer. (Sections 25 and 26 Vict.,c. 102 and 112.) If there is any doubt about this,enquiry should be made. Meantime, for purposes of this opinion I shall assume it to be a sewer, and not a drain. Upon this assumption I am of opinion that Section 73 does not enable the Vestry to close the old sewer and compel the Owners to connect with the new. Section 73 applies only when a house is found to be without 'a sufficient drain communicating with some sewer.' In such a case the Vestry have undoubtedly power to require a new drain to be laid, and they can prescribe the level, fall, etc., of the new drain. But I have very great doubt whether they can require the Owner of the house to lay the new drain so that it shall communicate with a different sewer from that into which the old drain discharged. If the Vestry are right in their suggestion they would have power upon discovering any defect, however trivial, in a house drain to require the house to be drained by another system altogether. I do not think this is a reasonable interpretation of Section 73. That section was really intended only to apply to cases where the house was not drained into any sewer. The insufficient or defective condition of an existing drain is dealt with by Sections 82-85. Assuming, however, that Section 73 does apply to a house which is now drained into a sewer, and the house drains are in some way insufficient, it is by no means clear that the Vestry have the right to prescribe the sewer into which the drain, when re-laid or made sufficient, shall go. The Vestry have full discretion as to the drain, its materials, level, fall, etc., but the drain when laid or repaired may lead into 'any such sewer.' The judgment in St. Marylebone (Vestry of) v. Vivet, 34 L.I., M.C. 214, confirm this view, though in that case the house drains were not found to be insufficient, and the precise point in the present case did not arise. "I may add that in my opinion the Owners would comply with the notices served upon them by relaying their house drains from new houses to the old sewer. It appears to me from the Surveyor's report that the real cause of complaint is the old sewer itself, the insufficiency of the house drains being capable of easy remedy and probably of secondary importance. If that sewer ought to be discontinued the procedure is under Section 69, which 97 provides for the very case, and under this section if the Vestry discontinue a sewer they must at their own expense provide new house drains iDto the new sevrer. I am of opinion that this is plainly the course which should be adopted in the case before me, the contrary suggestion, even if warranted by the language of section 73 (which I think is not the case) is in my judgment a straining of that section so as to apply to circumstances which 1 am sure were never in the contemplation of the legislature." The Vestry (in view of the above adverse opinion) resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the officers of the Vestry to endeavour to arrange terms with the Owners by putting in the new connections up to the fronts of the houses free of expense to them or otherwise and that upon the existing drainage being transferred to the front sewer in St. Marychurch Street, the old sewer at the back be abolished and that the previous resolution of the Vestry in the matter be rescinded, as previously recommended to the Vestry and of which notice has already been given, and on 16th April, 1895, the resolution of 20th November, 1891, referred to above, was, on the motion of Mr. Bisley, and seconded by Mr. Streeton, duly rescinded. The matter was subsequently satisfactorily arranged and the existing drainage transferred to the front sewer in St. Marychurch Street. Upon the application of the Owner of 56, St. Marychurch Street, upon whom a notice had been served to reconstruct the drainage thereto, the Vestry resolved upon the drainage being transferred to the front sewer in St. Marychurch Street, to put in the connection up to the front of the house free of expense to him, and to bear half the cost of the construction of the drainage up to the back wall of the house, in view of the fact of the house having drained into the back sewer for so many years, and which the Vestry now propose to abolish. On 16th July, 1895, the Surveyor was authorised to allow the drain of the School House in St. Marychurch Street to go into the new drain being made in the Burial Ground for the new Mortuary. 98 Swan Lane and Ainsty Street. On 17th December, 1895, the Sanitary Committee reported with reference to the drainage works at 14 and 16, Swan Lane, and 60 and 62, Ainsty Street, having inspected the sewer into which the properties drain, which consisted of an old brick culvert varying in size from 3 feet 2 inches by 2 feet, to 2 feet 9 inches by 2 feet, and drains, in addition to the premises mentioned, houses between Swan Lane and Ainsty Street, and Ainsty Street and Clarence Street, and Recommended that the existing old brick sewer extending from the junction with the main sewer belonging to the London County Council in Albion Street along Swan Lane and under the houses to Clarence Street be taken up and abolished and that a 15 inch pipe sewer be constructed along Swan Lane for a distance of about 65 yards, and a 12 inch pipe from Swan Lane under the houses and across Ainsty Street to Clarence Street, a distance of about 80 yards, both sewers to have the necessary man-holes, and to be laid on and surrounded with 6 inches of cement concrete. The Surveyor reported that since the meeting of the Committee he had ascertained that the old brick sewer in Swan Lane, for which it was proposed to substitute 65 yards of 15 inch pipe sewer, belonged to the London County Council, who were consequently liable for its reconstruction. Resolved—That the Clerk write to the London County Council informing them of the condition of the sewer in question and requesting them, subject to their approval of the Surveyor s estimate for the reconstruction thereof, to allow the work to be executed by the Vestry. Resolved That the recommendation of the Committee be approved subject to the foregoing variation. On 18th February, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk to the London ( ounty Council stating that the Main Drainage Committee did not see any objection to the said sewer being abolished if the A estry undertook to lay down and maintain a 15 inch 99 pipe sewer in the manner shown on the plan and section submitted, and further stating that in the event of the Vestry agreeing to such proposal the Committee would be prepared to recommend the Council to contribute the sum of £80 towards the cost of filling up the old brick sewer. Resolved That inasmuch as the Surveyor s estimate of the cost of reconstruction amounts to £115 12s. 6d., the Clerk write in reply, requesting them to reconsider the matter with a view to their paying the whole of the estimated cost of reconstruction. On 24th March, 1896, the Vestry had before them a further letter from the Clerk of the London County Council, stating that the Main Drainage Committee of the Council were unable to depart from their previous decision as regards the reconstruction of the sewer in Swan Lane, and asking to be informed whether the Vestry would now agree to the proposal contained in his previous letter. Resolved—That the Clerk write a further letter to the Council again drawing their attention to the fact that the sewer in question is in a defective condition, and being entirely under their jurisdiction they should pay for its reconstruction, and urging them to again take the matter into their consideration ; but that in the event of the Council declining to depart from their previous resolution, the Surveyor be instructed to at once proceed with the work upon the terms of the Council's letter of 4th February, 1896. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. On 18th February, 1896, the Vestry had before them copy of a letter addressed by the Vestry of St. Pancras to the London County Council as under Vestry Hill, Pancras Road, N.W., 17th January, 1896. Sir, HOUSE DRAINAGE. The Vestry at their meeting on Wednesday last had under consideration the question of the supervision of house drainage, more particularly the mattei el plans 100 being deposited with them for approval before the work is commenced, such plans to be retained by the Vestry as a permanent record of the course of the drains. At the present time the Vestry have 110 power to make By-laws in regard to house drainage, this duty resting with the London County Council under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. Under the Act, however, the Aestry some years since framed regulations, but they are of opinion that an amendment of the law is necessary making it compulsory upon builders and others to deposit plans with the local Authority before drainage work is commenced. Such plans would be most useful to the public to refer to in selling, letting, or hiring houses or parts of houses, and would also be of great benefit in saving expense and time in excavating and tracing the course of underground drainage in case of repairs or amendments. I am instructed by the Vestry to urge that the Council will be pleased to take such steps as may be necessary for promoting an amendment of the law to the following effect, viz. :— (a) "Before making any drain and before relaying, reconstructing, or amending the same, notice in writing sliall be given to the Vestry or District Board by the person intending to make such drain." (0) "Before making any drain, or altering the level or course of, or. making any addition to, or extending or curtailing any existing drain or any branch drain, a plan of the proposed drain and any existing drain shall be deposited with the Vestry or District Board by the person intending to make such drain or to alter or amend any existing drain." I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Clerk, C. H. F. barrett, London County Council, Vestry Clerk. Spring Gardens, S.W. and Resolved to take similar action. 101 Holidays. An application having been made by the Masons, Paviors and Labourers for leave of absence, the Vestry, on 2nd July, 1895, Resolved That those of the Masons, Paviors, and Labourers who have been in the employ of the Vestry for a continuous period of 12 months be paid for the four Bank holidays occurring during the year. An application having been made by the Caretaker at Bull Head Dock for leave of absence, the Vestry, on 2nd July, 1895, Resolved—That the Caretaker at Bull Head Dock and the Victoria Oil Mills be granted one week's leave of absence, subject to the Surveyor taking steps for the proper care of the premises meanwhile. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. Fulford Street and Braddon Street Insanitary Area.

Resolved That upon the scheme receiving the approval of the Council, the Clerk be instructed to have the same printed and deposited at the Vestry Offices, and have notices served upon the Owners and Occupiers of the properties scheduled therein, in accordance with the Act of Parliament. 103 On 4th February, 1896, the Surveyor reported that the notice to build four houses, Nos. 24, 25, 26 and 27, Braddon Street, and the plans for the drainage there to, were deposited again with him on the 28th January, that the proposed frontage line was in accordance with the frontage of the existing buildings, and that subject to the Owner taking all risks as to flooding in the proposed cellars, and to the main drains being laid to uniform gradients between the man-holes at the front and rear, the proposed works were in accordance with the regulations.

On 18th February, 1896, the Vestry resolved to appoint Mr. Robert Page, of the firm of Messrs.

(3) That the duties of Mortuary Keeper and Disinfector as printed, etc., be approved and adopted subject to the substitution of the words "Sanitary Inspector Davies for the words "Medical Officer of Health" in paragraph l, and the omission of the words "Medical Officer of Health" in paragraphs 3 and 9. (See also By-laws and Regulations.) 118 Obituary. Mrs. Brownfield, the wife of Mr. Samuel Brownfield, formerly a Commissioner for Public Baths and Washhouses and Public Libraries, died on 14th December, 1895, and on 17th December, 1895, the Vestry, on the motion of Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley, seconded by Mr. Mabbs, instructed the Clerk to write to Mr. Brownfield expressing the condolence of the Vestry with him in his loss. Mr. William Marillier, Librarian to the Public Library, died on 3rd January, 1896, and at the meeting of the Vestry on the 21st January, 1896, Mr. Stuart called attention to the fact, and moved that a vote of condolence be forwarded to Mrs. Marillier and her family in the irreparable loss sustained by them, and expressing regret at the small number attending the funeral, which was 110 doubt due to the want of timely information as to the date and time fixed for the ceremony; this was seconded by Mr. Mabbs, put, and curried unanimously and Resolved accordingly. At a meeting of the Vestry held on the 21st January, 1890, Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley drew attention to the sad circumstances attending the death of Prince Henry of Battenberg, and moved that this Vestry beg leave to offer to Her Majesty the Queen and H.R.H. Princess Beatrice respectful sympathy in their present deep affliction; this was seconded by Mr. Brownfield, put, and carried, and Resolved accordingly. At a meeting of the Vestry held on 3rd March, 1896, the Chairman alluded in feeling terms to the sad bereavement sustained by Mr. Sydney Brownfield by the death of his wife, and also to the exceptional trouble he had lately undergone by reason of the death of other members of his family following so closely upon each other, and moved that a letter be written to Mr. Sydney Brownfield expressing the very deep sympathy of this Vestry with him in his affliction; this was seconded by Mr. Mabbs, put, and carried, and Resolved accordingly. 110 Paving. Commercial Dock Road. The General Purposes and Works Committee having reported that their attention had been called to the condition of the paving in Commercial Dock Road abutting upon the premises occupied by Messrs. Holland and Hannen, it was Resolved—That the Surveyor be instructed to reset the kerb and relay the paving where necessary. Providence Row. On 3rd March, 1896, the Surveyor reported that as instructed by the Vestry he had prepared an estimate for paving with granite setts upon a foundation of concrete, the roadway by "China Hall" P.H.; formerly known as Providence Row, including a continuation of the existing footway upon the north side, the same amounting to £80. Mr. F. T. Talbot having called attention to the fact that no provision had been made for such expenditure in the estimate for the half-year ending 25th March, 1896, it was Resolved—That the Surveyor be instructed to delay putting the work in hand for a period of two months. Roadway, Southside Plough Road. Serious complaints having been made as to the nuisance arising from the bad and undrained condition of the roadway, south side of Plough Road, leading to Messrs. Hobman's stables, the Vestry on 18th February, 1896, instructed the Surveyor to prepare an estimate of the cost of pitching the roadway with granite setts upon a concrete foundation with the necessary crossing, and apportion the same upon the Owners of land or premises bounding or abutting upon the said road, and to carry out the work upon receipt of the money so apportioned. Rotherhithe Street. On 4th February, 1896, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having inspected the paving in Rotherhithe Street, abutting upon the premises occupied by 120 Messrs. Gabriel and Sons, and which they found apparently slightly undermined by water flowing under the paving stones and through the joints coming from Messrs. Gabriel's premises, but which apart from that-required repaving for a distance of about 150 feet. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That the Surveyor he instructed to relay the paving and reset the kerb as required at an estimated cost of £14, at the expense of the Vestry, the damage done by the water referred to not being great enough to warrant a charge being made in respect thereto, taking into consideration the general condition of the paving. St. Helena Road and Rotherhithe New Road. The sett crossing at the junction of St. Helena Road and Rotherhithe Now Road being in a bad state of repair, the Vestry, on the 1st October, 1895, instructed the Surveyor to relay the same with new stones upon a foundation of concrete at an estimated cost of £40. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Fines, etc. On 2nd July, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Solicitor to the London County Council, notifying the fact of convictions having been obtained by the Council under Sec. 19 of the Act, for breaches of the by-laws regulating the business of a manure manufacturer, and stating that the penalties imposed,—£55,—were payable under Sec. 119 of the Act to the Vestry as the Sanitary Authority upon application to the Police Court. Hospital Accommodation for Cases of Infectious Diseases. On l6th July, 1895, the Vestry had before them a circular letter from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, dated 11th July, 1895, as under;- 121 The Metropolitan Asylums Board, Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, London, W.C., 11th July, 1895. Dear Sir, Hospital Accommodation for Fever Patients. I regret to inform you that the available accommodation at the Hospitals of this Board for patients suffering from scarlet fever and diphtheria is nearly exhausted, and that new cases can only be admitted as vacancies are occasioned by discharges and deaths. I have therefore to express the hope that instructions may be given by your Board (or Vestry) to the Officers concerned to arrange for preference being given to the removal to the Board's Hospitals of these patients who, as a consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life, are most in need of Hospital treatment. I am also to ask your Board (or Vestry) to be good enough to instruct all Officers, who make applications for the removal of patients, to ascertain whether their requests are complied with or not, and when they have not been complied with, to repeat their applications day by day so long as their patients continue in a fit condition for removal, and until the removal is effected, and to add a statement of the circumstances which render the removal of the cases urgent. Yours faithfully, T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk to the Board. To T. J. Stokes, Esq., The Clerk to the Vestry of Rotherhithe. The suggestions made by the Board being already in practice in the Parish no action was taken thereon. On 15th October, 1895, the Medical Officer of Health called the attention of the Vestry to the delay in securing admission into the Board's Hospitals, and by direction of the Vestry the following letter was sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board:- 122 21st October, 1895. Dear Sir, Re Hospital Accommodation for Fever Patients. Adverting to your letter of 11th July last, asking this Vestry to arrange for preference being given for the removal to the Board's Hospitals of those patients who, as a consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life, are most in need of Hospital treatment; I am directed by the Vestry of this Parish to state that from a report of their Medical Officer it appears great difficulty is experienced by the Sanitary Officials in getting accommodation in the Board's Hospitals for even very urgent cases, without great delay, and as a consequence, the Vestry are receiving constant complaints from the parishioners; and to express the hope that the Managers will take into their serious consideration the immediate necessity of providing further accommodation for urgent cases, and thus prevent the risks attending the long delay in removals from this Parish to the Board's Hospitals. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. The Clerk, Metropolitan Asylums Board. To which the following reply was received:- The Metropolitan Asylums Board, Norfolk House, Norfolk Street. London, W.C., 29th October, 1895. James J. Stokes, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Rotherhithe Vestry. Dear Sir, I submitted to the Managers at their meeting on Saturday last your letter of the 21st inst., regarding the need of further accommodation for fever patients. The Managers are fully alive to the urgency of this question, and have done everything that is possible to extend the accommodation existing in the present hospitals. You are doubtless aware that another hospital is in course of erection, and in fact nearing completion; a second has been begun; and a third will be begun very shortly. Yours faithfully, T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk to the Board. 123 On 17th December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, forwarding for the Vestry's information copy of a letter which he recently addressed to Sir Edwin Galsworthy, relative to the difficulties experienced by the Managers with regard to accommodation for patients suffering from scarlet fever and diphtheria, and the steps the Managers had taken and were taking to meet such difficulties by the provision of an adequate extension of such accommodation, of which the following is a reprint:— METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, Strand, W.C., 29th November, 1895. Dear Sir Edwin, During the past year or two, when the Managers' Hospitals have been full, and admission has had to be refused to urgent cases of scarlet fever in consequcnce of lack of beds, it has been frequently urged that the Managers ought to "do something" to increase their accommodation, and it has more than once been at least suggested that they have been negligent in the matter of provision of adequate accommodation. In answer, therefore, to your request for a statement of the facts, I will endeavour to state, as briefly and as clearly as I can, exactly what the Managers have done and are doing to cope with the difficulty in which they are undoubtedly placed, and how far they can, with any justice, be accused of negligence or want of foresight in this matter. Five years ago, when I became Clerk to the Board, the Board possessed six lever hospitals with a total normal accommodation of 2,110 beds. They had felt pressure in the east end of London, and had already come to the conclusion that a new hospital "for the relief of the Eastern Hospital" was required, and they were making diligent search for a suitable site. That search, as you are aware, was somewhat protracted, owing to the density in the east end and the consequent dearth, or rather, as it ultimately proved, entire absence of a suitable site within the Metropolitan area; and, in April, l891, they were compelled to select a site outside the Metropolitan area, at Tottenham. The difficulties they encountered before this site was ultimately acquired are well known, and I need not further refer to them. 124 Now, consideration of the figures relating to fevers through a series of years preceding 1890 will, I think, sufficiently show that the Managers had no reason to anticipate that any further additions to their hospitals than the one contemplated would be necessary. Here are the figures:— Year. Total number of cases admitted to Fever Hospitals. Maximum number in Hospital at one time. 1883 2720 661 1884 2547 476 1885 1855 352 1886 2197 734 1887 6537 2764 1888 5152 1015 1889 5772 1884 In 1890-91, however, the effects of compulsory notification began to be felt, and here are the figures for those years: — Year. Total number of cases admitted to Fever Hospitals. Maximum number in Hospital at one time. 1890 8334 2435 1891 7809 2055 Other causes were simultaneously contributing to a large increase in the proportion of fever patients seeking admission to the Board's hospitals, and, in 1892, the rush was sudden and overwhelming, no less than 37,784 cases of fevers and diphtheria being notified, and 16,276 cases actually admitted to the Board's hospitals within the year. Each year since the proportion of fever patients for whom hospital treatment is required has been steadily increasing. Thus of the total scarlet fever cases alone (which are by far the largest number) notified in London there were admitted to the Board's hospitals:— In 1890 42.64 per cent. „ 1891 46.16 „ 125 In 1892 48.32 per cent. „ 1893* 48.31 „ ,, 1894 62.89 „ 1895* 64.81 It appears, therefore, now that a reversion to anything like the figures of the years prior to 1892 is quite out of the question. The first great point which it is important to emphasise is that the necessity for a very large addition to the Board's hospital accommodation became apparent suddenly in the year 1892, but that each succeeding year's experience has amply confirmed the necessity. The experience of 1892 was quite sufficient to convice the Managers that they must look to a much larger scheme of hospital provision than had previously seemed necessary, and they accordingly resolved to endeavour to find suitable sites for three large acute hospitals on the south side, within the Metropolitan area, and a site for a southern convalescent hospital outside the area. Now, what have the Managers actually performed during the past four years ? They have actually purchased five large sites for new fever hospitals, viz.:— Tottenham, Tooting (temporary hospital), Do. (permanent hospital), Lewisham, Shooter's Hill. On the first two of these sites they have already erected hospitals, in 1802 and 1893. respectively. On the Shooter's Hill site a fine new permanent hospital is approaching completion. On the Lewisham site an equally fine (and somewhat larger) hospital is in course of erection, and is to be finished in 1807; and plans have been approved, and it is hoped that before long the building of a permanent hospital on the Tooting (permanent) site will be commenced. ♦The percentages for these years relate only to the period of the year during which it was unnecessary to refuse admission. 120 Unfortunately a site for the proposed Southern Convalescent Hospital has not yet been secured. A great number of sites have been considered and inspected-one actually adopted, but disapproved by the Local Government Board but the difficulties of finding a suitable site for this purpose seem even greater than those which surrounded the search for the acute hospital sites. Surely the work of extension already effected is no mean performance when the great difficulties of acquiring sites are considered—the scarcity of adequate areas, the intense local opposition, and other circumstances. But this is not all. The Managers have also, during the same period, been actively pushing on with most important and much-needed alterations, additions, and improvements in their existing hospitals. At the Western Hospital they have twice purchased adjoining property, after most difficult negotiations, to an extent which more than doubles the original area, for the purpose of extending the hospital accommodation, and they have already partly covered the added area with new permanent brick scarlet fever and diphtheria blocks. They have also entirely rebuilt the laundry on a much larger scale, and have largely added to the original nurses' accommodation and other administrative buildings. At the North-Western Hospital, previously consisting of wooden or corrugated iron buildings of a "temporary" character, an entirely new administrative block has been built and occupied, and about one-half of the old hospital wards have been pulled down and replaced by permanent brick structures. At the Eastern Hospital temporary wards have been replaced by permanent, and a new store, new staff blocks, and other administrative buildings to a considerable extent have been provided. At the South-Eastern Hospital the old temporary laundries have been replaced by new permanent laundries, and an entirely new nurses' home has been built, and new permanent wards are now in course of erection. At the South-Western Hospital extensive alterations, chiefly in the administrative buildings, have been, and are being, carried out. 127 At the Northern Hospital an additional new permanent block for 100 patients has just been completed, and a year or two back the administrative buildings were very considerably enlarged for the accommodation of the nurses and other staff. In addition to these larger works, many improvements of a minor character have at the same time been effected. The Managers have also, within the past two years, taken important steps for the extension of their Ambulance Service. They possess three Ambulance Stations, and, at two of these, important enlargements and extensions have been carried out. They arc also building a new Ambulance Station at Shooter's Hill, which is nearing completion. They have acquired a site for a new Ambulance Station adjoining the South-Western Hospital; and, after most protracted negotiations, and after encountering all the formalities and difficulties of compulsory purchase, they have obtained a site for a third new Ambulance Station adjoining the North-Western Hospital—plans for which have been already approved, and the building of which will shortly be commenced. I think a consideration of the above facts will satisfy any one acquainted with the proceedings of public boards, that the Managers' record of progress during the past few years in the direction of making adequate provision for infectious hospital accommodation for this great metropolis is a complete answer to any charge of negligence in this respect, and, if only a proper site for a Convalescent Hospital can be secured at an early date, there is no doubt that within, say, three years from now, the Managers' total accommodation in fever hospitals will be upwards of 6,000 beds; in other words, they will, within some six years, have increased their normal accommodation nearly threefold. Even now I have not exhausted the story of the Managers' dealing with an emergency, for while they have been looking to permanent provision as the proper solution of the difficulty, they have not neglected to take every step that has been possible to make temporary provision by erection of wooden hut wards, and otherwise, to the utmost extent allowable within their existing hospitals. In the above outline of the Managers' proceedings with regard to Hospital accommodation, I have dealt only with the fever Hospitals, which provide accommodation for the various fevers and diphtheria, but it is perhaps worth while to add that, while the extensive 128 increase of fever accommodation has been in progress, the Managers have had also to deal with the demand for increased small-pox accommodation and increased imbecile accommodation. For small-pox they have raised the permanent convalescent accommodation at Gore Farm from 600 to 1,000 beds, and have purchased a site for a new acute hospital. For imbeciles they have purchased a site at Tooting, on which a new Asylum Infirmary is to be erected. I trust that the facts which I have put together in this letter may be of some interest and service to those Managers who, having comparatively recently joined the Board, may, at present, not be thoroughly acquainted with them. I am, dear Sir Edwin, Your faithful Servant, T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk to the Board. To Sir E. H. Galsworthy, j.p., d.l., Chairman. P.S.—I find that I inadvertently omitted to record in the above letter the actual numbers of admissions of patients to the Fever Hospitals for the three years 1892-3-4. They are as follow :— Year. Total number of cases admitted to Fever Hospitals. Maximum number in Hospital at one time. 1892 16,276 4,389 1893 18,674 3,558 1894 16,667 2,950 With regard to the third column, I should explain that in 1892 the proper normal accommodation, including the new hospital erected at Tottenham, was only about 2,000, and that it was in the belief that the emergency was a temporary one only, and owing to their anxious desire not to refuse cases, that the Managers sanctioned a crowding which their 120 Medical Superintendents are not prepared to repeat; they also used the Gore Farm (Small-pox) Convalescent Hospital, which there fortunately seemed no prospect of their requiring for its proper purpose. In 1893 the normal accommodation was increased, by the erection of the Fountain Hospital at Tooting, to about 3,000 beds, and a portion only of Gore Farm could be used. In 1894 all applicants were admitted. T. D. M. 11th December, 1895. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry considered a letter from the Vestry Clerk of St. Pancras, transmitting copy resolution forwarded by that Vestry to the Local Government Board as under:— "That the Local Government Board be asked to hold an enquiry and take evidence as to the present administration of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, such enquiry also to include its constitution, the mode of election, and scope of duties, its largely increasing yearly expenditure, and its failure to provide for the requirements of the Local Sanitary Authorities." Resolved—That similar action be taken by this Vestry. Public Conveniences. There being no conveniences in the Parish for women, the Vestry appointed the undermentioned gentlemen as Delegates to wait upon the Bermondsey Vestry, with the view their joining this Vestry in the expense of the construction and mainteance of an underground convenience for men and women on the old Millpond site, in lieu of the present Urinal in Southwark Park Boad, near the "Queen Charlotte p.h., viz.:- Mr. Vice-chairman Bisley, Mr. Churchwarden F. T. Talbot, and Messrs. Bealey, J. Brown, Moss, Mullenger, Stuart. 130 The above delegates attended the Bermondsey Vestry, who promised to give the matter their consideration, and on 2nd April, 1895, a letter was read from the Bermondsey Vestry, stating that the Sanitary and Public Health Committee of that Vestry desired to hold a Conference with a Sub-Committee of this Vestry's Sanitary Committee upon the subject, when it was Resolved—That the above gentlemen form the Sub-Committee to confer with the Sanitary and Public Health Committee of the Vestry of Bermondsey. On the 19th November, the following Report was submitted to the Vestry The Committee appointed by the Vestry to confer with a Sub-Committee of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee of the Vestry of Bermondsey, with reference to the question of the mutual construction and maintenance of an underground convenience for men and women on the old Millpond site, in lieu of the present urinal in Southwark Park Road, near the "Queen Charlotte "p.h., report having met the Sub-Committee of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee of the Vestry of Bermondsey on three separate occasions, and having visited the site of the present urinal in Southwark Park Road, opposite the "Queen Charlotte" p.h., and also the site in Galleywall Road, opposite the "John Bull" p.h., at the junction of Galleywall Road and Southwark Park Road, and after consideration referred the matter to their respective Surveyors, with instructions to each to prepare a plan of a Sanitary Convenience for men and women, to be constructed on the sites before-mentioned, viz. :— The Rotherhithe Surveyor to prepare a plan of a Sanitary Convenience to be constructed in Southwark Park Road, in the centre of the roadway, opposite the Queen Charlotte" p.h., showing the footway opposite set back to a distance of 350 ft., varying in width from 6 to 11 ft. The Bermondsey Surveyor to prepare a plan of a Sanitary Convenience to be constructed in Galleywall Road, opposite the "John Bull" p.h., at the junction of Galleywall Road and Southwark Park Road; l31 And to submit the same to a future meeting of the Joint Committee, which plans have been submitted by the respective Surveyors as under A plan of a Sanitary Convenience to be constructed opposite the "John Bull" p.h., showing accommodation as under:— Ten urinals and 4 w.c.'s for men, and 5 w.c.'s for women and with an inside area of about 42 ft. 6 in. by 18 ft. 6 in., at an estimated cost of £1,800, exclusive of the cost, (estimated at £20), of setting back the footway. A plan of a Sanitary Convenience, opposite the "Queen Charlotte" p.h., showing accommodation as under: Eight urinals and 5 w.c.'s, for men, and 4 w.c.'s for women, and with an inside area of about 58 ft. 6 in. by 9 ft., at an estimated cost of £1,486, inclusive of the sum of £100, the estimated cost of setting back the footway on the east side to a distance of 350 ft. And the Joint Committee, after consideration of the same, have resolved to recommend their respective Vestries, as under:— 1. That the Local Government Board be approached for their sanction to borrow the money for the purpose of providing the Conveniences, and that they be requested to make one enquiry for the two Parishes. 2. That the said plans be approved and adopted. 3. That the cost of the construction of the Conveniences be equally shared by the two Vestries. 4. That the Works be carried out by means of a Contractor under the supervision of the respective Surveyors by whom the plans were prepared. 5. That separate tenders be invited by advertisement in the usual way. 6. That the tenders when received be referred unopened to the Joint Committee for consideration and report. 132 Motion (Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley and Mr. Vezey)—That the recommendations of the Joint Committee be approved, and that the necessary instructions be given to the Clerk to apply to the Local Government Board accordingly. Amendment (Mr. Stuart and Mr. Young)—That in view of the loan indebtedness of the Vestry, and the present high rates in Rotherhithe, the further consideration of the erection of the Sanitary Conveniences in question, be adjourned for 12 months. Amendment put and carried by 9 to 8. The Vestry divided with the following result For the amendment. Mr. Aldridge, ,, Board, ,, Brownfield, ., Kimber, ,, Mortimer, ,, Streeton, ,, Stuart, ,, E. J. Talbot, ,, Walker and „ Young. (10.) Against. The Chairman, ,, Vice-Chairman, ,, Churchwardens, Messrs. F.T. Talbot and Vezey, Mr. J. Brown, ,, Foster, ,, Mabbs, ,, Moss and ,, Mullenger, (9.) Amendment declared carried; again put as the substantive motion and carried, and it was Resolved accordingly. The matter therefore stands adjourned for twelve months. The Vestry of Lcunondsey, however, agreed to the recommendations of the Joint Committee. 133 Removal of Offensive Refuse. On the 3rd December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Kensington, as under:— Vestry of the PARISH OF ST. MARY ABBOTTS, KENSINGTON. Town Hall, Kensington High Street, W., 26th November, 1895. Dear Sir, Removal of Offensive Refuse. The attention of the Vestry of Kensington has been called to the By-law (No. 1) of the London County Council, under Sec. 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, prescribing the time for the removal of offensive refuse, and to the difficulties which have arisen in consequence of offal from the premises of certain fishmongers and game dealers in their Parish being removed on Saturday evenings in contravention of such By-law. At the time the By-law in question was framed by the Council, my Vestry put forward the suggestion that the hours for the removal of refuse should be from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., and had this suggestion been adopted, it is felt that the difficulties which have since been experienced would not have arisen. It will be seen that compliance with the Council's By-law necessitates the storage of offal at fishmongers' and poulterers' premises from Saturday morning until Monday, a proceeding which must, it is thought, be generally deprecated on sanitary grounds, and my Vestry have been led to address a communication to the Council expressing the opinion that the By-law in question should be revised to allow of the removal of fish offal, etc., at other than the times at present prescribed, provided such offal is removed from the premises in suitable and closely covered receptacles, which will effectually prevent any noxious effluvia escaping therefrom. My Vestry are of opinion that no nuisance would arise from the removal, and conveyance through the streets, of fish and game offal during evening hours under such a By-law as that which at present governs the removal of refuse 134 matter from slaughter-houses, and which provides that suitable covered galvanized iron receptacles shall be used for the reception of the refuse matter, and that such receptacles shall be kept closed and removed in such a manner as not to cause a nuisance, either at the premises or in the public streets; and if your Vestry or Board concur in this view, I am to ask that they will support this Vestry's representations to the London County Council on the subject. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, WM. CHAMBERS LEETE, J. J. Stokes, Esq. Vestry Clerk. Resolved—That this Vestry support the Vestry of Kensington in the action taken by them. Temporary Shelter. As stated in the last Report, the Vestry resolved to purchase No. 15, Cathay Street, for the purpose of adapting the same as a temporary Shelter for the accommodation of members of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwelling for the purpose of enabling such dwelling to be disinfected by the Sanitary authority. On 2nd April, 1895, a deputation attended before the Vestry and handed in a memorial signed by residents, protesting against the purchase by the Vestry of No. 15, Cathay Street, for the purposes of a temporary Shelter, when considerable discussion took place, and Mr. Stuart moved, and Mr. Foster seconded, that the memorial be referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report. The motion was lost and no further action taken. On 21st May, 1895, the Vestry instructed the Surveyor to prepare a specification of the works lequired to put the house into thorough repair and an estimate of the cost thereof, and in view of the at present insanitary condition of the premises, instructed the Clerk to give the tenant notice to quit. 135 On 12th September, 1895, the following letter was received from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 11th September, 1895. Sir I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward to the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe the accompanying extract from a letter which the Board have received from the Home Office with reference to the purchase by the Vestry of No. 15, Cathay Street. I am to ask that the Board may be furnished with the observations of the Vestry on the enclosed communication, together with information as to the precise objects for which they propose to use the premises referred to. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED D. ADRIAN, Assistant Secretary. J. J. Stokes, Esq., Clerk to the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe. Extract referred to:— "I am directed by the Secretary of State to acquaint you for the information of the Local Government Board that his attention has been drawn to the purchase of No. 15, Cathay Street, by the Rotherhithe Vestry, for the purpose of establishing a temporary Shelter for persons suffering from infectious diseases. This house adjoins one of the Metropolitan Police Stations, and the Chief Surgeon to the Police apprehends considerable danger to the men stationed there, arising from the use of the house for the purpose in question." And by direction of the Vestry, the following reply was sent:- 17th October, 1895. Sir, 15, Cathay Street. With reference to your letter of 11th September last, enclosing copy extract from a letter the Board have received from the Home Secretary with reference to the purchase by the Vestry of No. 15, Cathay Street, and asking the observations 136 of the Vestry thereon, together with information as to the precise objects to which the premises arc to be put ; I am directed to inform you in reply thereto, that the Vestry have for some long time past been endeavouring to secure premises for the purpose of providing, free of charge, temporaly shelter or house accommodation for the members of any family in which any dangerous or infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwelling for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority, in accordance with sub-section 4 of section 60 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; and it was upon the advice of Dr. Shaw, the Vestry's Medical Officer of Health (who had been instructed, in conjunction with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, to search the Parish for suitable premises), that the house in question was purchased. The following is a copy of the Report made to the Vestry by the Medical Ollicer of Health upon the subject:— "After three days' search with the Chief Sanitary Inspector in various "parts of the Parish, this house is, in my opinion, the most eligible site " now to be found. In the first place, it is an entire house; this of course is "an important point, indeed, an absolute necessity. Upon careful examina"tion, the premises appeared convenient and quite suitable for the purposes "they are proposed to be put to, for with very little outlay they can be "adapted to the needs of the Parish. In my judgment, the surroundings of "the house are less objectionable than any other premises visited, being "almost entirely closed in, having no connection with three portions of "premises abutting upon it. The only objectionable feature is, that it is "situated in a rather narrow street (not a court or alley); but this "narrowness I fear will hold true of most of the streets in the Parish where "premises might be met with. The house, however, will in all probability "be very little used, but the clothes and bedding of those who may be "obliged to use it will be disinfected before removal, and every precaution "taken to carry out the removal with as little display and fuss as possible." The Board will therefore see that the Secretary of State has been misinformed, as the Vestry have not acquired the property for the purpose of establishing a temporary shelter for persons suffering from infectious diseases, 137 I am, however, directed to intimate that if the Police authorities still harbour objections to the purposes to which the house is to be put, the Vestry may entertain overtures from them for the purchase of the property. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. The Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. A further letter was subsequently received from the Secretary to the Local Government Board stating that he had forwarded a copy of the above letter to the Home Office, but he had received no further communication upon the subject; so it may be presumed that the explanation furnished to the Local Government Board was satisfactory. On 18th February, 1896, the Sanitary Committee reported having adjourned consideration of the works necessary to be done to adapt 15 Cathay Street as a temporary shelter, and having instructed the Surveyor to report as to the suitability of any portion of the Vestry's premises at Bull Head Dock as a site for the erection of a temporary shelter. On 3rd March, 1896, the Sanitary Committee reported that the Surveyor had submitted to them two alternative plans for the erection of a shelter at Bull Head Dock. Plan A, showing the shelter erected over the house to be provided for the caretaker of the Depot, consisting on the first floor of day room, scullery, bath-room, w.c., and two bedrooms, and on the second floor three bedrooms and w.c., arranged as cubicles, at an estimated cost of £450 in respect to such shelter. Plan B, showing the shelter erected above the proposed cart shed which fronts Rotherhithe Street, consisting of day-room, scullery, bath-room, and two w.c. two bedrooms for married couples, and five other bedrooms, the whole arranged as cubicles at an estimated cost of £300 in respect of such shelter. And being of opinion that Bull Head Dock is a better position than 15, Cathay Street for the shelter in question, 138 Recommended— (I.) That the freehold of 15 Cathay Street be sold with a reserve price of the amount of the purchase money paid by the Vestry. (II.) That the Surveyor be instructed to have a board fixed outside the premises offering the same for sale. (III.) That plan B, at the sum of £300, be approved and adopted. Resolved—That the recommendations of the Committee be approved. Resolved—That the Surveyor be and he is hereby authorised to proceed with the necessary contract drawings. Private Mews, Yards, etc. On 18th February, 1896, the Vestry had before them the following letter from the Wandsworth District Board of Works:— THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE WANDSWORTH DISTRICT. East Hill, Wandsworth, S.W., 25th January, 1896. Dear Sir, I am directed by this Board to send you the annexed copy of a letter addressed by them to the London County Council, and of the Council's reply thereto, with reference to the desirability of powers being obtained for Local Authorities to pave and drain mews, yards, and other private places, at the cost of the owners of property abutting thereon, without being compelled to adopt such places as public highways under section 105 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. As stated in the letter, this Board have experienced great difficulty in dealing with places of this description, of which there are a very large number in the District, and they trust that your Vestry will be disposed to agree with them in the opinion that the powers sought for should be conferred upon Metropolitan Local Authorities. In the provinces the Local Authority is not bound to keep in repair a place which has been paved and drained by the Authority at the cost of the owners of the adjoining property, unless the Authority think fit to declare the place in question to be a highway under section 152 of the Public Health Act, 1875. 139 I may add that the Board have not been able to deal satisfactorily with these places under sections 99 and 100 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, the magistrate having declined to make an order under those sections in a case taken before him. Moreover in most cases the freehold of the site is not vested in the owner (within the meaning of the Act) of the adjoining property, and there are generally a great many owners having property abutting on the places which are in the worst condition. I shall be glad to learn that your Vestry concur in the views of this Board in the matter, so that I may answer the question of the London County Council in their letter of the 30th November to that effect. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, HENRY GEORGE HILLS, Clerk. To the Vestry Clerk, Rotherhithe. [Copy.] THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE WANDSWORTH DISTRICT. East Hill, Wandsworth, S.W., 18th July, 1895. Sir, I am directed by this Board to inform you that they have experienced great difficulty in securing the cleanliness and proper sanitary condition of mews, yards and similar private places in this District. It frequently happens that a row of houses has in the rear a yard or passage which is used as an approach in common by the occupiers of all the houses. These yards or passages are usually very imperfectly paved and drained. To some of the persons for whose use they are intended, they are of great use, whilst others, who have a right to use them, only exercise their right to a slight extent. The consequence is that the latter class of persons are aggrieved if required to abate a nuisance, which, though existing opposite to their premises, has really been caused by their neighbours. If the houses are used as shops the passage is generally in a more or less insanitary state, especially when staples arc built abutting on it. In cases where such a passage or place forms a mews it could no doubt be dealt with by being paved as a new street under section 105 of the Act of 1855, but that would be taking over the liability for its future cleansing, maintenance, and lighting, and the Board do not consider that this ought to be a charge upon the rates. 140 Under section 150 of the Public Health Act, 1875), Local Authorities outside the Metropolis have power to pave and drain streets at the cost of the owners of property abutting thereon, and do not thereby, unless they so desire, take over the liability for after maintenance. The Board will be obliged if the London County Council will take this matter into consideration with the view of obtaining powers for Local Authorities in the Metropolis to pave and drain mews, yards, and other private places at the cost of the owners of property abutting thereon without being compelled to adopt such places as public highways. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) HENRY GEORGE HILLS, Clerk. The Clerk, London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. [Copy.] LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL, Spring Gardens, S.W., 30th November, 1895. Sir, The Public Health Committee of the Council have had under consideration your letter of the 18th July last, suggesting that the Council should endeavour to obtain powers for Local Authorities in London to pave and drain mews, yards, and other private places, at the cost of the owners of property abutting thereon, without being compelled to adopt such places as public highways. As the proposal appears to the Committee to be of great importance, and one which would affect to a very large extent the owners of property and their rights, the Committee would be glad, before reporting on the subject to the Council, to be furnished with particulars of cases in which the need for further legislation of this nature has been felt, and also to know what are the views of the Local Authorities generally on the question. I am, Sir, Your obtdient servant, H. DE LA HOOKE, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Wandsworth District Board. Resolved- That this Vestry concur in the views of the Wandsworth District Board of Works in the matter, and that they be so informed. 141 Re-naming and Re-numbering of Streets, etc. During the year the following Streets, etc., were re-numbered and re-named under Orders of the London County Council:— Name of Street. New name (if any). Old No. New No. Corbett's Lane — 17a 19 „ — Piggery 20 „ — Francis Cottage 21 Commercial Cottages Corbett's Lane 1 22 „ ,, 2 23 „ ,, 3 24 „ „ 4 25 Eleanor Cottages „ 1 26 „ „ 2 27 St. Helena Road — la 1 ,, — 2a 3 „ — 3a 5 „ — 4a 7 „ - — 9 „ - 1 11 „ - 2 13 „ - 3 15 „ - 4 17 „ - 5 19 „ - yard 21 „ — "St. Helena" p.h. 23 142 Name of Street.

Silwood Street, and stating that the Council would be glad of an expression of the Vestry's views on the matter. Resolved That the Council be informed that the Vestry see no objection thereto. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the delay in receipt of letters experienced by residents in Suffolk street, through the dual and triple numbering of the houses therein, the Vestry on 3rd December, 1895, instructed the Clerk to apply to the London County Council for a re-numbering order. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry resolved to apply to the London County Council, for an order to incorporate Neptune Court with Mary Street, and to re-number the houses therein. These orders had not been received up to the close of the year. Rights of Way. The following is a list of the public rights of way to the river in this parish : Opposite West Lane Platform Stairs King's Stairs Prince's Stairs Elephant Stairs Church Stairs Spread Eagle Stairs Timothy's Wharf, E. side Do. W. side Hanover Stairs Surrey Dock Stairs King and Queen Stairs King and Queen wharf Globe Stairs Horseferry Stairs Pageant's Stairs Horns' Stairs Nelson Dock Dantzic Wharf White Horse Stairs Laystall, Durand's wharf Acorn Wharf Stairs Commercial Dock Pier Randall's Rents and Dog and Duck Stairs. 144 Trinity Union Wharf. An application having been made by Mr. John Hollway for permission to use the right of way (at present unused) adjoining his premises, Trinity union wharf, .50;) to 309 Rotherhithe Street, for the loading of vans from the new jetty being constructed in connection with the Wharf. The Vestry Resolved—To grant the application upon Mr. Hollway paying a rent of £10 per annum, to his paying for the necessary pitching of the roadway by the Vestry, and to the erection of gates thereon by the Vestry at his expense, subject however to any rights the Vestry and the public might have over the said right of way. On 24th September, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from Mr. Hollway, expressing his willingness to pay £10 per annum for the use of the right of way, and asking to be allowed at his own expense to pave the roadway with the necessary pitching, the same to be done to the satisfaction of the Vestry. Resolved—That the request of Mr. Hollway be complied with. Burt, Boulton and Haywood's Wharf. On the 3rd September, 1895, the Vestry bad before them a letter from Messrs. Burt, Boulton and Haywood, 299 Rotherhithe Street, complaining of the loss of the lock of the upper 10 ft. way next their Wharf, whereby persons trespassed upon their premises and damaged their goods. The Surveyor was instructed to have a new lock fixed upon the gate of the right of way in question. Globe Stairs. On 2nd April, 1895, the Surveyor reported that the piling and sheeting forming the river wall at Globe Stairs having given way and the concrete been displaced by the action of the tide, it would be necessary to drive two new piles in front of the old ones and re-sheet behind the same, tilling in with concrete between the back of the sheeting and the existing ground, 145 Resolved—That the Surveyor be and he is hereby instructed to have the necessary work carried out. A letter was afterwards received from the Thames Conservancy, drawing attention to the above matter, and they were informed that the Surveyor would put the work in hand at once, and they subsequently approved the sketch of the proposed repairs to the river wall submitted to them by the Surveyor. Land between Matthews' Wharf and Yardley’s Granaries. On 18th February, 1806, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported receipt of a letter from Mr. Bristow, Solicitor, of Greenwich, claiming on behalf of the 7th West Kent Building Society the piece of land opposite No. 84, Rotherhithe Street, between Matthews' Wharf and Yardley's Granaries, which had been enclosed by the Vestry, and that it appeared from a report by the Clerk that this piece of land was, in the year 1886, conveyed by the then owner, Mr. E. Matthews to Messrs. A. and C. N. Matthews, who mortgaged the same to the West Kent Building Society. Resolved—That the land be given up upon payment by Mr. Bristow of the cost of hoarding, amounting to £2 4s. The money was paid and the land given up. Roadway, Southwark Park. It will be remembered that at the close of the last financial year the vestry had resolved to adjourn the further consideration of this matter until after the next London County Council Election, which took place on 2nd March, 1895, when Mr. W. H. C. Payne and Mr. A. H. A. Morton were duly returned for the Parish of Rotherhithe. The matter again came before a Special Committee of the vestry on the 29th March, 1895, and on the 2nd April, they reported having conferred with Mr. payne with reference to the Roadway, Southwark Park, who stated that the Council would not maintain and light the roadway, and that unless the vestry were prepared to do so or jointly with the 146 Vestry of Bermondsey, it would be useless to approach the Council on the subject, that the Vestry had as far back as 20th November, 1891, resolved not to bear the cost of lighting and maintenance, and to which resolution the Committee recommended the vestry to adhere. The Vestry accordingly resolved to adhere to their resolution of the 20th November, 1891, and instructed the Clerk to notify the Vestry of Bermondsey of the action taken by this Vestry in the matter. On 24th September, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Bermondsey, stating that, in reply to a request to the Parks Committee of the London County Council to receive a deputation from that Vestry re the opening of the roadway, Southwark Park, the Committee asked to be furnished with the proposals of that vestry before receiving the deputation, and he was instructed to ask this Vestry to appoint six delegates to confer with six appointed by the Vestry of Bermondsey, to agree upon what recommendations they would make to their respective Vestries in the matter, so that a definite statement in writing might be sent to the Council; when the Vestry Resolved—That six delegates be appointed by this Vestry to confer with the delegates appointed by the Vestry of Bermondsey, and that the Bermondsey and Rotherliithe representatives on the Council be invited to attend. The following gentlemen were appointed:-Mr.Vice-Chairman Bisley and Messrs. Board, Moss, Stuart, F. T. Talbot, and Walker, and on the 15th October, 1895, the following Report was submitted to the Vestry:— The Delegates appointed by the Vestry to confer with a Committee of the Bermondsey Vestry relative to the opening of the roadway through Southwark Park, report having met the Bermondsey delegates at the Town Hall, Spa Road, on Thursday, the 10th October, 1895, and having mutually agreed as under, subject to the approval of their respective Vestries:— 1. To equally share the cost of providing lamps and maintaining the lighting of the roadway, the estimated cost of same being—lamps £3 each, and lighting £40 per annum. 2. To invite the Parks Committee of the London County Council to meet the Joint Committee in the Park to discuss the actual requirements of the 147 Council with regard to the fencing of the roadway, and whether they will year the cost thereof, and of watching. 3. To require that the roadway be opened by 5 o'clock in the morning, and kept open until midnight, but for foot traffic only after dusk; and recommended that the previous resolutions of the Vestry, dated respectively 26th November, 1891, and 2nd April, 1895, not to bear the cost of the lighting and maintenance of the roadway, be rescinded, and the action of the Delegates approved. Resolved That the report of the Delegates be received, adopted, and entered upon the Minutes, but that the notice to rescind stand over for the present. On 19th November, 1895, the Committee reported having met the Bermondsey Delegates and a Sub-Committee of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the Council, at the roadway, Southwark Park, on Saturday, the 16th November, 1895, and discussed the question of the fencing and patrolling of the roadway (the Bermondsey and Rotherliithe Vestries having already agreed to equally share the cost of providing lamps, and maintaining the lighting of the roadway), and that after considerable discussion as to whether the Vestries should pay for the fencing and patrolling, or a proportion of the cost thereof, they had resolved that the previous resolution of the Vestry in the matter, viz.: to equally share with the Vestry of Bermondsey the cost of providing lamps and maintaining the lighting of the roadway, be still adhered to; but that the London County Council be respectfully requested to take over the entire control of the roadway, both by way of fencing and patrolling, free of any further cost to the two Vestries; and that the Chairman of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the Council, who was present, had promised to report the result of the Conference to the Committee. Resolved—That the report of the Committee be adopted. On the 17th March, 1896, the London County Council adopted the following report and recommendation of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee: The hour for closing the Council's parks varies with the seasons of the year, but for some time past we have, as an experiment, allowed the gates at each end of the road which crosses Southwark Park to be kept open until seven o’c lock during 148 months in which, in the ordinary course, they would have been closed at an earlier hour. This has been done for the convenience of the residents of the locality, and has been much appreciated by them. We have now been asked to extend this benefit by leaving the gates open until twelve o'clock at night all the year round. We think this should be agreed to, for the situation and configuration of the park are such as to inflict considerable hardship upon persons wishing to get from parts of Bermondsey to Rotherhithe, and vice-Verd, after the park is closed. The distance across the Park from Southwark Park Road to Gomm Road is about 370 yards, but to arrive at the same points after the park gates are shut involves a journey of at least 1,460 yards. The Council will recognise the desirableness of this concession to the working population of the two districts and their families, when it is explained that on the eastern side of the park are the Surrey Commercial Docks, the Baths and Washhouses, the Free Library, St. Winifred's Institute, and St. Olave's Infirmary, besides the New Town Hall and the Vestry Offices, whilst on the west side are large manufactories, the local market, and the Spa Road Station on the South Eastern Railway. The efficiency of the Fire Brigade will also be improved, as the engines from Gomm Road Station will be able to get through the park into Bermondsey without having to stop and unlock the gates as is now the case. Some small expense will necessarily be involved in conferring this boon upon the inhabitants, and although it is not specifically provided for in the estimates it can be paid out of the contingency fund for next year. We recommend—That the central road through Southwark Park be kept open, during the pleasure of the Council, until midnight; and that, subject to an estimate being submitted to it by the Finance Committee, as required by the statute, the Council do authorise an expenditure of £'250 for the erection of fencing and gates along each side of the road referred to, an expenditure of £100 for the provision of gas lamps and the necessary connections thereto, and a further estimated annual expenditure of £8 for the lighting of the same. So the A estry may well congratulate themselves upon the result of their efforts in having seemed the use of the roadway without any charge to the local rates. 149 Sale of Food and Drugs Act. On 5th November, 1895, the Vestry resolved, with reference to the sale of milk, that the undermentioned suggestions and observations in respect to the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts be submitted to the Local Government Board for their consideration:— Mixtures.— The requirement that a mixed article should be sold as a mixture is not a protection to the public, as it is possible for the seller, who knows the Inspector, to notify the fact to him only, and a written notice can be produced that a certain article was sold as a mixture of milk and water. Taking Samples.— It is not clear that under Section 3 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act, 1879, an Officer is empowered to go to a place of delivery outside the district of his authority to take a sample of an article of food intended to be sold in such District. Labels.— Section 27 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, prescribes a penalty for giving a false label, but does not make a label compulsory. If every vessel or parcel in or from which any of these articles were sold, were required to bear a label, clearly and accurately describing its contents, this clause would be improved. All vehicles and vessels supplying milk to the public should bear in legible letters of a stipulated size the name and address of the owner of the milk. Milk and Water.— The possession of for instance, milk and water, by a milk seller, should be a criminal offence, as there is no demand for any such article. Separated Milk.— "Separated milk " should not be allowed to be used or sold; or, if it is, there should be a label to this effect in two-inch letters affixed to all the vessels carrying the same. Pure Milk.— The term "Milk" should be understood to mean pure milk with nothing added thereto or taken therefrom. Skim Milk.— "Skim Milk" should be understood to mean milk from which the whole or part of the fat has been abstracted, and all vessels carrying the same should be legibly labelled with two-inch letters. 150 Milk and Water.— Any person having milk and water in his possession for the purpose of sale, or exposed for sale, should be guilty of an offence under the Act, and liable to a penalty. Licensing of Milk Vendors.— All vendors of milk should be licensed by a Licensing Authority, and any person engaged in the sale of milk other than the servant of an employer should be liable to a fine of £5, and 40/- per day after notice thereof from the Licensing Authority, and licenses withdrawable or cancelled, endorsed or otherwise dealt with by the Licensing Authority on the application of the Inspector and proof of conviction. On 3rd March, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Clerkenwell re the sale of Ice Creams, stating that that Vestry had had a bacteriological examination made of samples of water in which ice cream glasses had been washed, such samples being taken from stalls in the street, enclosing copy of the analyst's report to the Local Government Board, again requesting the Board to promote legislation for the purpose of providing for the registration of the vendors of such creams, and for empowering the Board to make By-laws for the regulation of the trade. Resolved That this vestry support the action taken by the Vestry of Clerkenwell in the matter. On 24th March, 1896, the vestry had before them a letter from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board, suggesting that as the Select Committee on Food Products Adulteration had been re-appointed, the Vestry might offer evidence to the Committee with respect to their proposals as regards ice cream. The Medical Officer of Health was instructed accordingly. 151 School Board Rate and Divisions. On 1st October, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, protesting against the ever-increasing expenditure of the School Board for London, and resolved to concur in the views set forth by the Board. On 3rd December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Hammersmith with copy resolution passed by that Vestry as under:— [Copy of Resolution.] "That in view of the alarming increase which has taken place in the precepts of the London School Board, this Vestry is of opinion that the time has arrived when amounts raised under the provisions of the Elementary Education Act should be made an Imperial charge, and equalised throughout the kingdom." Resolved-That this Vestry agree with the resolution passed by the Vestry of Hammersmith. The following is a copy of the resolutions passed at a Conference of rating authorities of the Metropolis, held at the Town Hall, Kensington, upon the same subject:— [Copy Resolutions.] 1. (a) That this Conference of Delegates, representing twenty-four of the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis, as defined by the Elementary Education Act, 1870, whilst recognising the valuable work performed by the School Board for London and the benefits it confers upon the community, is nevertheless of opinion that the expenditure of the Board has been unduly excessive and has become a very heavy and oppressive burden upon the Ratepayers, and that action is urgently called for with a view to the curtailment of such expenditure. (b) That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that a limit should fixed by Statute to the School Board Rate. (c) That, in the opinion of this Conference, the time has arrived when an enquiry should be instituted, either by a Royal Commission or a Select Committee of one of the Houses of the Legislature, into the expenditure of the School 152 Board for London, and also into the present incidence of the Rate levied to meet the expenses incurred in the administration of the Elementary Education Acts in the Metropolis. 2. (a) That, in the opinion of this Conference, the present School Board Divisions are inconvenient, and the Parliamentary Boroughs as set out in the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, should be substituted therefor. (b) That the Register to be employed for School Board purposes should be the Register of Parochial Electors as defined by the Local Government Act, 1894. 3. That a copy of the resolutions passed by this Conference be communicated to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President and Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education, the School Board for London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, and that the Prime Minister be asked to receive a Deputation from this Conference to support the representations contained in the said resolutions. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Town Clerk, Borough of "West Ham, transmitting draft of a petition intended to be presented to Parliament with regard to the School Board Bate, and asking this Vestry should they agree with the views contained therein, to be good enough to seal a petition on the lines of the said draft, and present same to Parliament, and request their local Member to support any Bill which might be introduced into the House to give effect to the prayer of the petition. Resolved That the Vestry support the action taken by the Corporation of West Ham, and seal a similar petition to Parliament. The following is a copy of the petition of the Vestry:— To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition ot the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe in the administrative County of London, under their Common Seal. 153 Sheweth as follows:— That your petitioners are the Sanitary Authority for the Parish of Rotherhithe. That the Parish of Rotherhithe has a population of over 40,000 people, with a ratable value of £210,858. That, in the year 1871, a School Board District was formed under the Elementary Education Act of 1870 for the Parish of Rotherhithe. That at the time the Elementary Education Act of 1870 was passed into law by your Honourable House, the country at large was assured by Her Majesty's Ministers that it would be unnecessary to levy in the vast majority of "cases a rate to meet the deficiency in the school fund of a larger sum than threepence in the pound. That the Right Hon. W. E. Forster, the Vice-President of the Council on Education, stated, with regard to the rate,— "I know when I talk of rates I am touching very delicate ground, and I do not "for a moment dispute that the whole system and principle of rating is one of the "questions which urgently demand the consideration of this House. I trust, "however, that no reasonable Member present will wish to keep the children " throughout England untaught until that question is solved. After all, it is but a "very small matter as regards the rate. An Education Rate would save the Prison "Rate and the Pauper Rate. It would not be a special rate, but a charge on the "Poor Rate; but should it exceed threepence in the pound, and I do not believe "that it will amount to anything like that sum in the vast majority of cases, then "there is a clause in the Bill which stipulates that there shall be a very considerable "extra grant out of the Parliamentary votes." The Right Hon. Gentleman "further stated that "Practically the Bill provides for a rate not exceeding threepence "in the pound, in order to carry out the requirements of the Act. That amount "of rate would very rarely be exceeded, indeed in my opinion a smaller levy would "be quite sufficient to work the Act." That the said clause referred to is of no practical value as a means of relief in the present circumstances of the case, seeing that as against millions raised by local taxation in those districts where the rate is threepence in the pound and upwards, only a sum of about £18,000 is applicable in relief under the provisions thereof. That the financial results of working the Elementary Education Act of 1870 and the successive legislation passed since that date, have imposed a charge upon the ratepayers at large, which in your Petitioners' opinion is unjust and inequitable, as no 154 fewer than 2,127 boroughs and parishes out of an aggregate number of 2,304 are levying rates at the present time of threepence and upwards in the pound, and in no less than 310 boroughs and parishes is the rate levied one shilling and upwards in the pound, as is evidenced by the Annual Reports of the committee of the Council on Education. That in the Parish of Rotherhithe, the rate required to satisfy the Precept of the London School Board for the year ending 25th March, 1896, is no less than 12.63d. in the pound, producing a sum of £10,109, the amount required by the School Board for the District to meet the deficiency in the School Fund for the year named. That the rates levied in the Parish for the year ending 25th March, 1896, amount to the sum of 8s. 5d. in the pound. That having regard to the whole of the national circumstances which gave rise to the legislation of 1870; to the fact that local administration was resorted to in lieu of State administration, notwithstanding the fact that education was compulsory and the obligation of its provision a duty of the State ; to the unquestionable assertion that in some cases at the present time the amount falling upon local taxation in successfuly administrating the educational work of the country has now reached such proportions that the charge is intolerable and a dangerous barrier to municipal progress ; to the rapid increase of local taxation in general and to the duties annually imposed upon localities for the purposes of local self-government by Parliament; to the curriculum laid down by, and the ever increasing requirements of the Education Department, your Petitioners humbly and respectfully suggest that the time has arrived when the capitation grants should be increased and Parliament should limit the amount to be raised by means of local taxation, and should provide out of Imperial funds such other amount as may from time to time be necessary to meet the deficiency which might exist in the local school funds throughout the country. your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will, after due enquiry, pass a short Bill to redress what your Petitioners venture to consider is a grievance caused by a burden improperly placed on local taxation, which has assumed proportions beyond which Parliament ever intended or contemplated. And your Petitioners will as in duty bound ever pray, etc. The Common Seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe was hereunto affixed by order this 21st day of January, 1805, in the presence of JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. 155 South Eastern Railway Co. Station at Rotherhithe New Road. On the 5th November, 1895, the Clerk reported that by direction of the Vestry he had written a letter to the Secretary to the South Eastern Railway Co., urging the necessity for the provision of a station in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe New Road, and stating that the Vestry proposed to wait upon the Company by deputation in support thereof, in reply to which the Secretary had requested an interview; that he called upon Mr. Stevens, the Secretary, who informed him that the Company were doing all they possibly could in the matter, but had met with many difficulties which had caused delay, and stated that it would be more desirable that the Vestry should wait upon the Company by deputation at a later date. Resolved—That in view of Mr. Stevens' communication to the Clerk, the Vestry postpone their intended visit to the Company by deputation. On 30th November, 1895, a plan showing the widening of the railway from Raymouth Road across Rotherhithe New Road, along Corbett's Lane and Silwood Street to Deptford, together with notice of the intention of the Company to apply to Parliament for leave to bring in a Bill for the purpose was deposited at the Vestry offices. \ ' - On 17th December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Solicitors to the Company, requesting to be informed whether the Vestry assented to, dissented from, or remained neutral in respect to the same. Resolved—That the Vestry formally "dissent from" the proposed undertaking in order to obtain a locus standi in the matter, and that the Clerk at the same time write to the Solicitors explaining the Vestry's reasons for so doing and pointing out that the vestry are still unaware of the intentions of the Company with regard to the constitution station in the Rotherhithe New Road, as they have not yet had a copy of the Bill before them. On 21st January, 1896, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported in reference to the Bill of the South Eastern Railway Co., Session 1896, receipt of letter from the Solicitor to the Company, stating he was informed by the Company's. 156 Engineer that it was proposed to put a new station in the vicinity of Rotherhithe New Road, when the widening had been made; that the Clerk and Surveyor had had an interview with the Engineer, who assured them that it was the intention of the Company to erect a station at the "Half Way House," between Silwood Street and Rotherhithe New Road when the widening should be completed; that there were no rights of way along existing viaducts or at any point under the roadway, all the roads being private and belonging to the Company, and that the Company's addition to the existing bridge would be in one span of 70 ft., and that they were not prepared to face the walls of the existing or new abutments with white glazed bricks. Resolved—(1) That the question of any public rights of way alongside existing viaducts or at any point under the roadway, more especially at White Post Lane, be referred to tho Board of Churchwardens and Overseers for consideration and report.

On 18th February, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Solicitor. South Eastern Railway Company, asking to be informed whether Corbett’s Lane was a public or private road, the Solicitors to Ram's Trustees having stated that it was private, tho freehold thereof belonging to their clients.

Lower Road. On 2nd April, 1895,"the Vestry resolved to make application to the London County Council to set back the fence of Southwark Park, in the Lower Road, so as to widen the footway at that spot, and on 18th June, a letter was submitted from the Clerk to the Council, stating that the Council had resolved that the boundary railings of Southwark Park, Lower Road, which were to take the place of the old wooden fencing, be set back to the line shown on the plan submitted by the Vestry of Rotherhithe ; that the strip of the Park between the proposed new line and the original boundary be used as a portion of the footpath, and that stones be laid by the Vestry in the paving to the satisfaction of the Chief Officer of the Parks Sub-Department to mark the boundary of the Council's land, and asking whether the Vestry would agree to lay such boundary stones, which was agreed to by the Vestry. The Vestry also resolved, in view of the fact that the forecourts of the Public Library and house adjoining, No. 120 Lower Road, would then project beyond the Park railings, to approach the Library Commissioners and the owner of 120 Lower Road, as to setting back such forecourts to the line of the Park railings, and instructed the Clerk accordingly. On 2nd July, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the occupier and sub-lessee of 120 Lower Road, stating that he would offer no objection to the proposed setting back of the forecourt of the premises, subject to the consent of the leaseholder and freeholder; also a letter frcm the Library Commissioners, offering no objection to the setting back of the forecourt railings, conditionally upon the Vestry bearing the cost thereof, and placing a stone in the paving marking the boundary of the Commissioners' property. On 6th July, 1895, a letter was received from Messrs. Still & Son, stating that Mrs. Garr-Gomm, the freeholder, had no objection to forecourt of No. 120, Lower Road being set back, as desired by the Vestry, 2 feet 6 inches, provided that the sanction of Mr. Knust, the lessee, was obtained. And on 16th July, 1895, a letter was submitted-to the Vestry from Messrs. Loxley, Elam and Gardner, Solicitors to the lessee, enquiring what the Vestry proposed to pay for the setting back of the forecourt in question, when the Clerk was instructed to state in reply 161 that the freeholder and sub-lessee had notified their willingness that tbe forecourt fence should be set back as desired by the Vestry without consideration, and enquiring whether the lessee could not see his way to do the same, and intimating that any reasonable costs of the lessee's Solicitors in the matter would be borne by the Vestry. The lessee subsequently gave his consent without any consideration, and the work of setting back the fences of the forecourts of the Public Library and 120, Lower Road, was carried out at a cost of £28. Moreton Terrace and Slipper's Place. An application having been received from the Trustee of Slipper's Estate, for permission to enclose a portion of the site of the old millstream fronting Moreton Terrace, in exchange for a piece of land in Slipper's Place, to enable him to build upon the piece of vacant land at the corner of Moreton Terrace and Slipper's Place, the matter was referred to the Genera] Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report, and on 2nd July, 1895, the Committee reported with reference thereto that they had visited the spot, which was simply a piece of waste ground and a nuisance, and were of opinion that the houses intended to be erected thereon would be an improvement to the existing state of things as well as a source of increase of rates to the Parish. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the application be agreed to. Rotherhithe Street, by Bull Head Dock. In connection with the adaptation of Bull Head Dock and the victoria Oil Mills as a Wharf, and the scheme and plan prepared by the Surveyor, and appro\ed by the vestry; It was Resolved to widen Rotherhithe Street at that spot at an estimate cost of £600, by setting back the frontage line of the Vestry's premises to the line of the other buildings, and to ask the London County Council to contribute one-half of the estimated cost of the improvement. 162 Messrs. Green, of Surrey Commercial Wharf, having written stating that it was their intention to re-erect shortly the buildings fronting the street, and enquiring whether the Vestry desired any of the frontage for the widening of the road, the Vestry, on 2nd July, 1895, Resolved (1) That the setting back of the frontage line of Bull Head Dock and the Victoria Oil Mills to the line of the other buildings as previously agreed upon and submitted to the London County Council, be adhered to, and that the offer of Messrs. Green to set back their frontage line be not entertained. On 27th June, 1895, a letter was received from the London County Council, stating in reply to the Vestry's application for a contribution towards the cost of the improvement, that the Council being of opinion that the improvement was desirable, had decided to make a contribution, but the Council considered that the case would be met by a contribution of onethird instead of one-half of the net cost; that the Vestry's estimate of £600 included a sum of £170 for rebuilding the front of an office, making good a roof, and building a new fence wall along the whole length of the property, which the Council considered could not properly formed part of the cost of widening the street; deducting therefore this amount the estimated net cost of the improvement was £430, and the Council's contribution would therefore be limited to a third of the net cost, not exceeding £143 Gs. 8d. On 2nd July, 1895, the Vestry resolved to accept the offer of the Council to contribute one-third of the cost of the improvement, estimated at £430, and instructed the Surveyor to have the work of setting back the existing buildings executed at once. The improvement was duly effected before the close of the year. Rotherhithe Street, by Swan Lane. A letter having been received from Messrs. Long and Gardiner, Solicitors for the Owners of Nos. 158, 160, 162 and 164, Rotherhithe Street, and the "Royal Standard" p.h., enquiring what the Vestry would offer to have the frontage line of the whole block up to Paxton's Alley set back; the Vestry on 2nd April, 1895, instructed the Clerk to ascertain the terms required by the Owners, and referred the matter to the General Purposes and AVorks Committee for consideration and report: And on the 7th May, 1895, the Committee reported that the Surveyor had submitted a 163 plan showing the street widened by about 5½ ft. by setting back the frontages of the houses in Rotherhithe Street from No. 158, up to Paxton's Alley, and that the Clerk had ascertained from the Solicitors of the Owners of the property, they would require as compensation for setting back the frontages as shown on the before-mentioned plan the sum of 1150. Resolved—Upon the recommendation of the Committee, (1) That the offer of the Solicitors of the Owners of the property to set back the frontage line of Nos. 158, 160, 162 and 164 Rotherhithe Street, and tho Royal Standard p.h., corner of Paxton's Alley, to the line as shown on the plan submitted by the Surveyor, be accepted. (2) That the improvement be carried out at once, and that the London County Council be requested to make a contribution towards the cost thereof. The Clerk was also instructed to ascertain the terms of the freeholder and leaseholder of No. 168 Rotherhithe Street at the corner of Swan Lane, for the sale thereof to the Vestry: And on 2nd July, 1895, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported that the freeholder of No. 168 and the five adjoining houses was a Mr. Roffway, of 27 Blackheath Road, S.E., and the leaseholder a Mr. J. Ayres, of 70 Wyngate Street, E C., the latter holding the six houses on lease for an unexpired term of 60 years, at a ground rent of £22 for the whole ; that No. 168, the house proposed to be purchased by the Vestry, was let at 9s. per week, landlord paying taxes; that the freeholder apportioned the sum of i.'.» as the ground rent thereof, and upon that basis asked 40 years' purchase, viz., £200, for his interest, which amount the Committee thought excessive; that the leaseholder upon the same basis asked £164 for his interest, which the Committee thought reasonable, and having power to act, they had Resolved— (1) That subject to coming to terms with the freeholder, the oiler of Mr. Ayres to sell his leasehold interest in No. 168 Rotherhithe Street for the sum of £164, be accepted. (2) That Mr. Roffway's offer to sell his freehold interest in No. 168 Rotherhithe Street being in their opinion excessive, the Vestry offer Mr. Roffway the sum of £150, being at the rate of 30 years' purchase for his freehold interest. This was approved by the Vestry. 104 On 16th July, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from Mr. Roffway's Solicitors, stating that subject to an apportionment of £5 as the rent and their charges for arranging and completing the sale being paid by the Vestry, Mr. Roffway would accept £150 for his freehold interest in the property. The Clerk was instructed to apply to the London County Council for a contribution towards the total cost of the improvement. The purchase was on 1st October, 1895, reported by the Clerk to be completed, and the Surveyor was instructed to proceed with the improvement at once : And on 5th November, 1895, the Clerk was instructed to invite tenders by advertisement in the local papers for the pulling down of 168 Rotherhithe Street, and the erection of a gable end wall in connection with the improvement at that spot, and the following tenders were subsequentlv received:— £ s. d.

On 17th December, 1895, the Yestry had before them a letter from the Clerk, London County Council, stating that the Council had Resolved to make a contribution towards the cost of the proposed widening of the road, such contribution to be limited to half the net cost, not exceeding £302, and enclosing a copy of the conditions on which the contribution was made. The improvement was duly effected before the close of the year. 165 Somerset Place, Lower Road. As instructed, the Surveyor prepared and submitted to the Vestry at their meeting on 7th March, 1895, a plan with reference to the setting back of the fence by Somerset Place, embracing the houses in the Lower Road as far as the Public Paths and Washhouses, and showing the footway widened to the line of the Workhouse wall to a width of 12-ft. and with the view of either then or at some future time effecting an improvement by widening the footway up to that spot. It was Resolved— (1) That the plan and line showing the footway from the Workhouse wall up to the Baths widened to a width of 12 ft., be approved and adopted. (2) That a plan of the improvement be forwarded to Messrs. Still & Sons, the Solicitors to the freeholder, notifying them that the line as shown on the plan has been approved and adopted by the Vestry, and asking that the line may be taken into consideration as the leases of the property fall in. (3) That the Clerk negotiate at once with the owners for the setting back of the projecting wooden fence in front of the houses in Somerset Place, to a line with the Workhouse wall, and widening the footway to the width shown on the plan before mentioned. On 18th February, 1896, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported that the freeholder required the sum of £36, and the leaseholder the sum of £85 for their interests in the strip of land in question. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the matter stand over until it be seen what action the St. Olave's Guardians propose to take in the matter of the erection of a new Workhouse. 166 Surrey Commercial Dock Scheme. On 18th June, 1895, the Surveyor reported receipt of a letter from the Engineer of the Pock Company, in reference to the width of the footways to the new roads to he constructed under the Surrey Commercial Dock Company's Act of 1894: that the total width of the roads had to be 40 feet in the clear, but no apportionment of roadway or footway was given ; that the usual width was 8 ft. on either side for a total width of 40 ft., but he was of opinion that a width of 6 ft. on either side would be quite sufficient as the extra 4 ft. in the roadway would best serve the particular traffic to be provided for, and that the Engineer to the Dock Company had forwarded his plan to the Engineer of the London County Council, showing a 6 ft. footway on either side, but that the Council's Engineer asked for an official confirmation of the 6-ft. Resolved—That the footways to the new roads be of a width of not less than 7 ft. on either side. Application having been made by Messrs. Pearson & Son, the Contractors for the Dock Extension, for permission to construct a line of rails across Plough Road, level with the pitching, so as to facilitate their work on either side of the road in connection with the extension of the Docks; the Vestry on 2nd July, 1895, Resolved—That upon Messrs. Pearson & Son undertaking to take steps to stop the traffic on either side of Plough Bridge each time anything is about to cross by keeping a watch (police preferred) at each end, and upon the condition that only two trains an hour shall be allowed to cross during the day, say up to 8 p.m. [no restriction being placed as to the number of trains from 8 p.m. up to say 5 a.m.,] their application be agreed to, subject to the work being carried out to the satisfaction of the Surveyor, and to their entering into an agreement to indemnify the Vestry against all loss, costs, charges, damages, and expenses, by reason of any accident occurring, or otherwise. This was agreed to by Messrs. Pearson & Son, and an agreement entered into by them in accordance with the terms laid down by the Vestry. 167 Thames Communication. On 7th May, 1895, Mr. Payne, L.C.C., informed the Vestry that the necessity for Thames Communication between Rotherhithe and Ratcliff had been admitted by the London County Council, and that they had endeavoured to bring in a Bill, but that it was so opposed by the shipping interest that the matter dropped, and the Council would probably now wait until the Blackwall Tunnel should be completed. On 2nd July, 1895, a letter was read to the Vestry from Mr. Morton, L.C.C., stating that the question of the Rotherhithe Tunnel had been before the Bridges Committee of the Council, at which the Chief Engineer was instructed to gain fall information with regard to the nature and character of the soil through which the tunnel would have to be constructed, and that probably some time would elapse before a report upon the subject would be received from the Engineer, but promising to keep the Vestry fully informed as to the progress of events. On 19th November, 1895, Mr. Vice-Chairman Bisley introduced Mr. Fairbairn as the speaker on behalf of a Deputation from the Eotherhithe and Bermondsey Electoral League, on the subject of Free Thames Communication at Eotherhithe, who handed in the undermentioned Memorial:— ROTHERHITHE AND BERMONDSEY LABOUR ELECTORAL LEAGUE. "The Ship" Tavern, St. Marychurch Street, Rotherhithe, S.E. November 19th, 1895. To the Vestry of St. Mary, Rotherhithe. Gentlemen, We, the undersigned, representing a meeting of the above League as Ratepayers of the Parish, Respectfully Sheweth—That for very many years the public have been demanding some means of crossing the river from Rotherhithe to Wapping. Several suggestions have been put forward,such as a Tunnel, Steam Ferries, or bridge. About 168 1893, two years ago, it was proposed to establish a Steam Ferry from Rotlierhithe to Stepney, which was abandoned, owing to the opposition of the St. George-in-the-East Vestry, who required a direct Ferry, and about nine months ago the matter was placed before the Members of the Rotherhithe Division of the London County Council, who promised to use their best efforts to bring the proposal before the Bridges Committee of the Council, and also that instructions had been given to the Engineer to prepare a plan for a Tunnel, and up to the present no report has been given. Your Memorialists respectfully consider that after all these years of delay the public requirements of the District have been apparently neglected. The St. Ceorge-in-the-East Vestry are still in favour of a direct Steam Ferry. Your Memorialists consider with them that a Free Steam-boat Ferry would meet the requirements of the District. The proposal for a Tunnel would mean a further delay. And as the greater portion of the vehicular traffic to the South side passing over the Tower Bridge comes towards Rotlierhithe (85 per cent.), no doubt 50 per cent. enters the Docks. And as the Districts of Greenwich and Deptford are agitating for a Steam Ferry we believe no very serious opposition can be raised against the same for Rotlierhithe. We respectfully submit the time has arrived for the Vestry, as representing the public requirements of the District, to at once place the proposal before the London County Council Bridges Committee, and urge them to include the same in their Omnibus Bill, in the coming Session of Parliament, 189G, in view of the necessity for Free Thames Communication being established in Rotlierhithe. And Your Memorialists will as in duty bound ever pray. Richard Faiiirairn, William Henry Foreman, Henry Simpson, W. E. Skudder, J. G. Baker, H. J. Huff. The Memorial was referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report. 169 On 3rd December, 1895, the Committee reported with reference to the Memorial from the Rotherhithe and Bermondsey Electoral League, praying the Vestry to take steps to secure free Thames communication at Kotherhithe; that as far back as 1885, the Vestry were agitating in the matter, and quite recently presented a Memorial to the London County Council, urging them to apply to Parliament for powers to establish a Free Ferry from Rotherhithe to Wapping with the necessary approaches. Resolved—That the Rotherhithe and Bermondsey Electoral League be informed in reply to their Memorial, that the Vestry have not lost sight of the necessity for Free Thames Communication at Rotherhithe, and are urging the matter upon the London County Council. Town Hall, Vestry Hall, Offices, etc., Erection of It will be remembered that before the close of last year, the Vestry accepted the plans of Messrs. Murray & Foster, of Adelphi Chambers, 7 John Street, AV.C., which were approved by the London County Council; and on 2nd April, 1895, the Vestry Resolved to invite tenders for the erection of the Buildings, in the "Builder," "Contract Journal," "London" and "Southwark Recorder." The plans being subsequently found not to meet the requirements of the Council with regard to Stage Plays, but only for Music and Dancing, the Architects were instructed to make such alterations as were necessary to meet the requirements of the Council in the matter, and on 30th April, 1895, they wrote stating that a slight modification was required to the plans, so as to obtain the Lord Chamberlain's licence, as well as that of the London County Council, and forwarding tracings showing such modification, and that the application had passed the Committee, and they expected the Official approval in a few days, and on 9th May, 1895, they wrote again stating that they had that day received the Official approval to the Town Hall Drawings for the Lord Chamberlain's licence for Stage Plays. Before inviting tenders for the erection of the buildings, tenders were invited for the demolition of Nos. 81, 83, 85, and 87, Neptune Street, which stood upon part of the site. The tender of Mr. W. Penfold, of East Greenwich, was accepted at the sum of £32 10s. 170 Advertisements were in due course inserted in the following newspapers, inviting tenders for the erection of the buildings : "Southwark Recorder," "Contract Journal," "Builder," "London," and on 21st May, 1895, the Clerk submitted nine tenders received, which were opened and numbered by the Chairman, and referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration, and to recommend a tender for acceptance. The Committee met on 24th May, 1895, and reported as under to a Special Meeting of the Vestry, called in pursuance of a requisition on 31st May, 1895:— That the nine tenders received for the erection of the Buildings were as under: If panelling to Vestry Hall in Oak—add If stonework to South elevation artificial stone —deduct £ £ s. d. £ s. d. 1.

Williams, be accepted at the sum of £14,768, plus £280 for oak panelling to Vestry Hall, making a total of £14,998, subject to his sureties being found satisfactory, and to the bill of quantities being properly filled in. An amendment to this, however, was moved—That the next lowest tender, that of Mr. H. L. Holloway, be accepted at the sum of £15,200 plus £200 for oak panelling to Vestiy Hall, making a total of £15,400, subject to his sureties being found satisfactory, and to the bill of quantities being properly filled in. 171 This was carried, and upon being again put as the substantive motion. A further amendment was moved-That the whole question be referred back to the Committee for reconsideration and report. This was put and carried, again put as the substantive motion and carried, and Resolved accordingly. On 11th June, 1895, the Committee reported having reconsidered as to the acceptance of a tender for the erection of the Buildings, and again recommended the acceptance of the tender of Mr. Williams. An amendment to this was again moved—That the tender of Mr. Holloway bo accepted ; this, however, was lost, and the Vestry ultimately Resolved—That tender No. 4, that of Mr. Howell J. Williams, be accepted at the sum of £14,768 plus £230, for oak panelling to Vestry Hall, making a total of £14,998, subject to his sureties being found satisfactory, and to the bill of quantities being properly filled in. On 18th June, 1895, the Clerk reported that he was in receipt of a letter from Mr. Howell J. Williams, asking that a Bond of the Provident Clerks and General Guarantee Association, of Birchin Lane, might be accepted in lieu of personal sureties. This was agreed to by the Vestry, but on 2nd July, 1895, the Clerk further reported with reference to the Contract for the Town Hall, that Mr. Williams, in view of the fact that it would cost him £300, wished to substitute sureties for the Guarantee Bond, and gave as his sureties his father and brother, or if the Vestry preferred he would give a Bond for £1000 or deposit £1000 with the Vestry's Treasurer, in the names of the Chairman and himself; and the Vestry ultimately Resolved to dispense with personal sureties upon Mr. Williams depositing as a guarantee for the due performance of the Contract, £1000 with the Treasurer, in the names of the Chairman and himself, or deeds to that amount to the satisfaction of the Clerk. Mr. Williams subsequently deposited £1000 with the Vestry's Treasurer, in accordance with the above resolution. 172 Advertisements were issued inviting applications for the post of Clerk of Works for the erection of the buildings, and 50 applications were received, and on 11th June, 1895, the Vestry elected Mr. John Carter, of 20, Chadwell Street, Myddleton Square, E.C., Clerk of Works, to superintend the erection of the new Town Hall, A estry Hall, Offices, etc., at a salary of £8 10s. per week, subject to a week's notice to quit, to his residing in the Parish, and devoting his whole time to the duties of the office. On 2nd July, 1895, the Vestry Resolved to appoint a Committee of seven, consisting of Mr. F. J. Bisley, Vice-Chairman, and Messrs. Stuart, Mullenger, E. J. Talbot, Moss, Vezey, and Kimber, to watch the progress of the Town Hall buildings. On 16th July, 1895, the Vestry Resolved to invite Mrs. Carr-Gomm, the Lady of the Manor, to perform the ceremony of laying the foundation stone, and instructed the Committee to make the necessary arrangements. On 3rd September, 1895, the Town Hall Committee reported that they had been in communication with Mr. Carr-Gomm, who had written stating that it would afford much pleasure to Mrs. Carr-Gomm to assist at the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone, and intimating Tuesday, the 17th September, as the most convenient day for the purpose, and they had therefore Resolved that the ceremony should take place on that day, which was approved by the Vestry. The Committee also reported that they had instructed the Surveyor to provide some flags and other decorations for the occasion, and submitted the following inscription to be placed upon the stone for the approval of the Vestry:— "This foundation stone was laid on Tuesday, the 17th day of September, a.d. 1895,by Emily Blanche Carr-Gomm, the wife of Francis Culling Carr-Gomm, Esq., and Lady of the Manor of Rotherhithe." The Vestry Resolved That the inscription be approved and adopted. That the foundation stone be of red granite, and be laid in front of the buildings facing Lower Road, and that a separate stone be provided bearing the names of all the Vestrymen, and placed adjacent to the foundation stone, and in front of the buildings facing Lower Road, 178 That a bottle containing some of the current coins of the realm and newspapers be provided for placing in the stone, together with a parchment scroll containing a short description of the day's proceedings, and a list of the Members and Officers of the Vestry. The Committee also reported that their attention had been called to the excavations for the foundations of the buildings, the depths of which according to the specifications had apparently been deviated from; that they had attended on the site and met the District Suveyor, Architect and Builder thereon, that the Architect explained the exact alterations in the foundations which he proposed to make, and in which Mr. Stenning, the District Surveyor, concurred:— "The main trenches and the concrete thereto to office block to be spread from 5 to 8 ft., the foundation of Tower to be spread from 18 to 25 ft., the pier holes to Hall to be spread 9 ins. all round the bottom of all trenches, and the concrete to same to be placed at an average of 12 ft. 6ins. from ground line instead of 14 ft.," which he considered quite satisfactory and would take all responsibility, and stated that the reason of the proposed alterations was that the ballast was found to be of a higher level than was anticipated, and that in his opinion the present bottom was quite good enough and would be no better further down, being perfectly reliable and quite sufficient for the superstructure and as good as pile driving, and in view of Mr. Murray's explanation, the Yestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, to leave the matter in the Architect's hands to carry out as suggested. The ceremony of laying the foundation stone by Mrs. Carr-Gomm, the Lady of the Manor, took place on Tuesday, 17th September, 1805, at 3 o'clock, and the company present included amongst others the following:— F. C. Carr-Gomm, Esq., Hubert Carr-Gomm, Esq., W. H. C. Payne, Esq., Stafford Still, Esq. (Steward of the Gomm Estate), Rev, Canon Beck, M.A., J.P. (Chairman, and ex-officio Member of the Ventry).

Kimber, Moss, Mullenger, Stuart, E. J. Talbot and Vezey, be rescinded, and that such Committee consist of the whole of the members of the Vestry. This was seconded by Mr. Young, and upon being put to the meeting, there appeared 10 for and 3 against, but not being carried by the requisite majority of two-thirds of the members present, in accordance with By-law 12, was declared to be lost. On the 9th October, 1895, the Licensing Committee of the London County Council granted the application of the Vestry for a provisional licence for Music and Dancing, in respect to the Town Hall, subject to no restrictions. On 5th November, 1895, the Clerk was instructed to convene a meeting of the Town Hall Committee, periodically, so that a report may be made to each meeting of the Vestry. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry Resolved—That the Architects be requested to instruct the Clerk of Works to make a fortnightly report to them as to the progress of the works, and upon receipt of such report, to forward same to the Clerk for the consideration of the Vestry. Application was made by the direction of the Vestry, for the redemption of the Land lax charged on the site of the old Drill Hall, and on 21st January, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Deputy Registrar of Land Tax, stating that the Commissioners oi Inland Revenue had signed a Contract for the redemption of the land tax upon the land in question, and that the amount of consideration, £34 17s. 2d., must be paid to the Receiving Officer ot Inland Revenue, at 18, Newington Butts, S.E. (to whom the Contract had been forwarded), on or before 25th January, 1896. A cheque was accordingly ordered to be drawn for that amount in favour of the Receiving Officer of Inland Revenue. 177 Tower Bridge. On 17th December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry of Bermondsey, with copy resolution passed by that Vestry as under: That a communication be sent to the Corporation of the City of London, pointing out the great inconvenience caused by the high level footway being closed at dusk, and asking them to allow the footway to remain open (at such times as the Bascules are raised) until 10 p.m., also to suggest the desirability of opening the lifts to the public at such times as the Bascules are open for river traffic until 10 p.m., and asking this Vestry, should they approve of such resolution, to send a similar communication to the Corporation. Resolved—That this Vestry support the aetion taken by the Vestry of Bermondsey in the matter, and send a similar communication to the Corporation of the City of London. Tradesmen.

On 21st May, 1805, the Surveyor was instructed to have made vertical all the bars of the Tree Guards, which curved outwards, and were under the height of six feet. On 2nd July, 1895, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having inspected the Tree Guards in the Southward Park Road, which they found varied very much in height, 28 of them being very low. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Surveyor be, and he is hereby instructed, to have the 28 low guards made of one uniform height of six feet. Unemployed. On 2nd April, 1895, the Surveyor reported that 1,921 men had been employed since the opening of the register, at a total cost of £425 1s. 6d. On 21st May, 1895, the Vestry Resolved to grant to Mr. A. Fletcher, one of the Vestry's employees, the sum of £2 for keeping the Unemployed register. On 3rd December, 1895, the Vestry had before them a circular letter from the General Secretary, Amalgamated Society of House Decorators and Painters, asking the Vestry to assist in mitigating the evils of lack of employment which every year play such havoc in their ranks, by giving out as much painting work as possible, and pointing out that there is no reason why the interior work of every description in the painting trade could not be done equally well in the winter as in the summer season of the year. Resolved—That the Clerk write to the London County Council and the School Board for London, requesting them to give out the work in the winter time as suggested. On 17 th December, 1895, the following replies were submitted to the Vestry:— From the Clerk of the London School Board, stating that the Board had declined to have painting done in the schools during the Christmas holidays as it was impossible to allow sufficient time for the work to dry before the reassembling of the scholars, but that tenders had been accepted for the cleaning of 42 schools during the holidays. From the Clerk of the London County Council, stating that every effort would be made by the Council to carry out during the winter, not only painting, but other kinds of work Which could, having due regard to the interests of the ratepayers, be executed at that period. (See also Conferences.) 179 Vacant Land. Wyndham Road. On 2nd July, 1895, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported having considered a letter from a Mr. Knight complaining of the piece of vacant land in front of St. George's Terrace, Wyndham Road, being a nuisance and a danger in consequence of children throwing the loose stones about, and also complaining of the refuse from the horses belonging to a Mr. Chicken. The Vestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee (1) That the piece of land, having apparently no owner and being a nuisance, be enclosed by the Vestry, sufficient space being left to give Mr. Chicken access to his premises which partly abut upon the land in question. (2) That Mr. Knight be referred to Mr. Chicken with reference to his further complaint as to the nuisance occasioned by Mr. Chicken's horses. On 1st October, 1895, the Surveyor reported that he had seen Mr. Chicken, the occupier of the premises adjoining the waste piece of ground opposite St. George's Terrace, Wyndham Road, in reference to providing him with access thereto, and that Mr. Chicken claimed "right of user" over the whole area, and threatened to apply for an injunction should the Vestry in any way prevent him free access, not only to his doorway but over the whole land, but that he had, however, expressed his willingness to pay the Vestry a rent f«»r the fence should such be erected, so that he might enjoy the use of the enclosed land; when the Vestry Resolved—To enclose the whole of the land in question, and that it Mr. Chicken wants permission to use part of the land for his business, a formal application must be made to the Vestry who will deal with it in the ordinary way. On 3rd December, 1895, the Surveyor reported that acting upon the Vestry's instructions, he commenced on Monday, the 25th November, the erection ot the fence around the waste piece of ground in Wyndham Road, and on the Wednesday afternoon the work was completed, except the post in front of the doorway in the hide wall of the adjoining factory, 180 in the occupation of Mr. Chicken, who assaulted one of the workmen by striking him in the face and prevented the men going on with the work by placing himself in the hole dug for the post, desiring them to assault him by pulling him out, and that it was subsequently arranged between the Clerk, Mr. Chicken and himself, that the work should be completed without prejudice to the rights of the Vestry or those asserted by Mr. Chicken, he to have the use of the ground until the matter should be brought to the Vestry's notice, and his Solicitor in the meantime to communicate with the Clerk. The matter was referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report, and a summons taken out in the meantime against Mr. Chicken for assault. On 17th December, 1895, the Clerk reported that he attended at the Greenwich Police Court on Tuesday, 10th December, 1895, in support of a summons taken out by one of the Vestry's workmen against Mr. Chicken, for an assault committed during the erection by the Vestry of a fence to enclose a vacant piece of land in Wyndham Road, when the magistrate adjourned the same for a week; that he had again attended the Court that morning, and upon the case being called, Mr. Chicken contended through his Solicitor that he had a right over the said ground, and that in view of the question of right having been raised, the magistrate adjourned the further hearing for 4 weeks to see what steps might be taken by Mr. Chicken in the meantime for the enforcement of his alleged rights over the land in question. On 21st January, 1896, the Clerk reported that he had that morning attended Greenwich Police Court at the adjourned hearing of the summons taken out by one of the Vestry's workmen for an assault committed by Mr. Chicken, when the magistrate inflicted a fine of 5s. and .£2 2s. costs upon Mr. Chicken, who had given notice to appeal. On 4th February, 1896, the Vestry, in view of Mr. Chicken having several times broken open the gate to the land, which was padlocked, Resolved That the resolution of 1st October, 1895, be strictly adhered to, and that the Surveyor be instructed to entirely fence in the land without any gate, and that Mr. Chicken bo informed that if he wants permission to use part of the land for his business, a formal application must be made to the Vestry, who will deal with it in the ordinary way. 181 On the 18th February, 1896, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported receipt of a letter from Mr. C. 0. Took, offering without prejudice, on behalf of Mr. Chicken, to pay an amount of money as might be agreed upon in respect to the fence erected by the Vestry on the land in question, and also a further amount in respect to the paving provided he is allowed the use of the land, and upon the Vestry agreeing to refund the same should any one successfully lay claim to the land at any time, and that they had referred the matter to the Clerk with the view to Mr. Chicken entering into an agreement to pay an annual rental and to give up possession of the land on short notice. Resolved—That the action of the Committee be adopted. On 24th March, 1896, the Surveyor reported that in accordance with the resolution of the Vestry, and after notice to Mr. Chicken, he had early that morning boarded up the fence enclosing the land, but that at 7.30 a.m., a person named Harry Chicken, residing at the "Duke of Edinburgh" P.H., No. 1, Forsyth Street, wilfully and maliciously broke down and destroyed the fence so erected, doing damage to the extent of .£2 4s. The Clerk reported that upon the Surveyor being about to entirely fence in the ground notice was given to Mr. Chicken to remove eight vans belonging to him, which were on the vacant land, and upon default they were moved by the Vestry's men and placed in the roadway, but as they could not be allowed to remain there, a second notice was served by the Surveyor, under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, giving Mr. Chicken notice to remove the vans within. 12 hours, in default of which the same would be removed by the Vestry at his cost. Resolved—That the matter be left in the hands of the Clerk to take immediate action. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. 182 Water Supply, etc- In view of the dearth of water owing to the frost during the winter of 1895, the Surveyor was instructed to have the water vans thoroughly cleansed and supply water to the poorer inhabitants of the Parish, subject to the consent of the Water Companies, and to tender accounts to the Water Companies (The Southwark and Vauxhall and the Kent Waterworks) of the cost of sending out the water vans to supply the inhabitants with water, and on 7th May, 1895, the Surveyor reported that as instructed by the Vestry he had tendered accounts to the Water Companies as mentioned above, and had received a letter from the Southwark and Yauxhall Water Company, denying their liability to pay the amount. Resolved—That it be referred to the Clerk to report as to the powers of the Vestry in the matter. On 2nd July, 1895, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported as to the drying up of the wells in the Parish, and the consequent loss of time experienced by the Vestry's workmen, and also as to the number of water carts in the possession of the Vestry not being sufficient. Resolved— (1) That the Surveyor be authorised to have three stand posts erected and connected with the Water Company's mains, such stand posts to be erected where the dearth of water is mostly felt, at a cost of 8.½d. per thousand gallons, 10s. 6d. per quarter meter rent, and the cost of making the connections. (2) That the Surveyor be authorised to purchase one of Willacy's Patent Rotary Water Vans at a cost of about £45. The Surveyor was also authorised to have a supply of water laid on to the Depot for filling Loiler of Steam Roller, and washing-out purposes. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of St. George's, Hanover Square, with copy resolutions passed by that Vestry praying the Right Hon. G. J. Goschen, M.P., to use his influence with the Government to promote legislation 183 to prevent the water companies increasing their charges for water, which are based on annual value, by adopting the increased values contained in the Valuation List recently deposited, and expressing the hope that this Vestry would take similar action in their district. Resolved That this Vestry support the resolution passed by the Vestry of St. George's. Hanover Square, and send a similar communication to Mr. Macdona, M.P. On 21st January, 1896, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Paddington, with copy resolution passed by that Vestry, viz.:— "That it be an instruction to the Representatives of this Vestry on the London Water Supply Conference, to press for such legislation as will throw upon the Water Companies the responsibility for the maintenance of the communicating pipe from the Company's main to the screw-down valve or tap on the Occupier's premises, instead of on the Occupier as at present." Resolved—That this Vestry support the action taken by the Vestry of Paddington. Water Troughs. On the 8th May, 1895, the following letter was received from the London Master Carmen and Cartage Contractors' Association relative to the use of water troughs: LONDON MASTER CARMEN AND CARTAGE CONTRACTORS' ASSOCIATION. 79, Wool Exchange, Coleman Street, London, E.C., May 7th, 1895. Dear Sir, I am directed by my Association to approach your Board with a view of obtaining their co-operation in the closing of the public water troughs under their control, and the erection of standpipes in their stead. My Association have long been of opinion that the public water troughs are a constant source of spreading infection of glanders and farcy among horses—in which opinion they have the support of nearly every veterinary surgeon of reputation. 184 We have already been heard before the London County Council, and that body whilst expressing themselves in complete accord with our views, explained that the powers of closing the troughs rested with the several district authorities. We have also approached the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, but they decline to receive a deputation from this Association on the subject. In response to our representation the City Authorities have thrown open all the standpipes within their jurisdiction, free of charge, for the use of horse-owners for watering horses. Of course a plentiful supply of fresh water for horses is absolutely necessary, but so strongly do my Association feel as to the danger of the open troughs that they would rather see them closed even if no other accommodation was provided, but they suggest that standpipes at more frequent intervals could be erected and maintained at much less cost than the public troughs as now in existence, ar.d the danger of infection from this source would be greatly minimised. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) ARCHIBALD WHITE, Secretary. And referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report, but the Committee before taking any action in the matter invited the views of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association upon the subject, in response to which they received the following letter :— METROPOLITAN DRINKING FOUNTAIN AND CATTLE TROUGH ASSOCIATION. 70, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W., James J. Stokes, Esq., July 5th, 1895. Vestry of Rotherhithe, Dear Sir, In reply to your letter of the 3rd respecting a communication received from the London Master Carmens and Cartage Contractors' Association, asking to close our troughs, I have to inform you that from long and careful experience my Committee are fully convinced that there is no danger of the troughs being a source of contagion. 185 In deference to the public outcry two years since as to the spread of glanders the Association temporarily closed all its troughs for a few weeks, but as no abatement of the disease was observed, and so much suffering and increase of abdominal complaints, distinctly traced to the want of water, were produced, the Committee felt compelled, after taking the best possible advice, to again open all the structures. The Committee are, of course, fully aware thai in an outbreak of disease it is natural that some suspicion should immediately attach to the troughs, but they have no hesitation in saying that if the disease is spreading, the cause must be sought elsewhere, and may be found in the deficient ventilation, defective sanitary arrangements, and overcrowding of many of our Metropolitan stables, and from too lax an enforcement of the laws which so strictly prohibit the concealing, using and selling horses suffering from glanders and farcy. The fittings at the end of each trough through which the water flows direct into the gulley, are of the best possible kind, and all the troughs are constantly inspected and cleaned by men specially employed for that purpose; many schemes have been suggested at various times, but after cartful consideration have been found impracticable. The Committee consider that the vast number of valuable horses which hourly drink at our troughs in London and suburts ought to be sufficient proof that the owners of such animals do not consider the troughs a source of danger. I enclosc copy of correspondence which took place with the Metropolitan Hoard of Works in 1881, and we have no reason to alter the opinions then formed. We sincerely trust that for the sake of the thousands of animals who so largely benefit by a free draught of water, that your Vestry will not listen to unfounded and vague charges, but rather encourage the erection of more troughs in your district. Yours faithfully, (Signed) M. W. MIL I ON, Secretary. 186 [copr correspondence referred to.] CORRESPONDENCE between the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association and the Metropolitan Hoard of Works, respecting alleged danger arising from glandered horses drinking at the public cattle troughs. Spring Gardens, S.W. November 24th, 1S80. Sir, Your Association may possibly be aware of a fact which is officially within the knowledge of the Board, that the disease of glanders has lately been spreading in the Metropolis; and it has been suggested to the Board by various persons that the spread of the disease is in some measure to be attributed to the use of the public drinking troughs, most of which are under the control of your Association. It is unnecessary to point out the serious nature of the disease, and the Board has no doubt that your Association will desire to do whatever lies in its power to check and prevent its extension. I am accordingly to suggest for your consideration, the desirability of making some alteration in the construction of the drinking troughs in the streets of the Metropolis, which might tend to lessen the possibility of disease being communicated through animals drinking at these troughs,. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIELD, Clerk of the Board. The Secretary, Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cuttle Trough Association, 111, Victoria Street, S.W. 187 Victor'a House. Victoria Street, Westminster, December 9th, 1880. J. E. Wakefield, Esq., Metropolitan Board of Works. Sir, I have submitted your letter of the 24th ult. to the Committes of this Association, and am instructed to thank the Board for their communication, and to assure them that the possibility of disease being communicated through glandered horses drinking at the public cattle troughs is a subject which has never been lost sight of by them, and that every precaution has always been taken to diminish the risk. The accompanying Memorandum on the subject will show that the watchfulness of the Association in this direction has been so successful that since the formation of the Society in 1859, not a single complaint or intimation has been received of a horse having contracted the disease at one of their troughs, although it is estimated that not less than 200,000 horses are now drinking daily at them. The whole matter was anxiously considered by the Association before they originated these structures, and the experience of many years fully confirms the opinion at which they then arrived, that the benefit and relief to be derived from them would be incalculable, whilst with proper precaution the risk of spreading disease would be very slight. The Committee are, of course, fully aware that in an outbreak of disease, it is natural that some suspicion should immediately attach to the troughs, but in view of the facts enumerated in the accompanying Memorandum, they have no hesitation in saying, that if the disease is spreading, the cause must be sought, elsewhere, and amy probably be found in the deficient ventilation, and defective sanitary arrangements, and overcrowding of many of our Metropolitan stables, resulting from too lax an enforcement of the laws which so strictly prohibit the concealing, using, and selling 188 horses suffering from glanders and farcy. You arc possibly aware that when an inquiry was addressed to Her Majesty's Government respecting the increase of the disease in March last, it was officially stated by one of the Under Secretaries of State in the House of Commons, that this increase was more apparent than real, being probably attributable to greater activity on the part of local authorities in prosecuting persons under the Contagious Disease (Animals) Act. but in view of the statement contained in your letter, that it is officially within the knowledge of your Board that glanders has lately been spreading in the Metropolis, the Committee of the Association have, since the receipt of that letter, increased the flow of wafer through their troughs, which they believe to be the most effectual way of still further minimising the risk. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JOHN LEE, General Manager and Secretary. Spring Gardens, S.W., December 2<)th, 1880. Sir, The Board has considered your letter of the 9th instant, containing the reply which the Committee of your Association has been good enough to make to the communication made by the Board with reference to the desirability of measures being taken to prevent the possibility of the spread of glanders among horses through the medium of the public drinking troughs provided by the Association. In the Memorandum which accompanied your letter it is, I observe, stated that a stream of fresh water is continually running through the troughs, and that they arc constantly inspected and cleansed by men specially employed for the purpose. The Board is glad to find that, as it expccted, the desirability of taking precautions against the drinking troughs being a means of spreading disease has been recognised by your Association, and that measures have been taken for that purpose. The Board now desires to suggest for the consideration of the Association 189 that, in addition to the drinking troughs being so constructed and used as to have a constant supply of water through them, there should be an arrangement for the water to run off by means of a tumbling bay direct to a gully. The Hoard would further suggest that the troughs should be thoroughly cleansed every morning. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, T. E. WAKEFIELD, The Secretary, Clerk ot the Board. Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, 111, Victoria Street, S.W. Victoria House, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W., J. E. Wakefield, Esq., January 19th, 1881. Metropolitan Board of Works. Sir, I am instructed by the Committee of this Association to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, suggesting that in addition to the precautions described in my letter and accompanying Memorandum of the 9th ult., there should be an arrangement at the troughs for the water to run off by means of a tumbling bay direct to the gully, and that each trough should be thoroughly cleansed every morning; and I am directed to inform you that, acting on that suggestion, we have now fixed a bay or weir at the end of each trough through which the water flows direct into the gully, and that (as stated before) all the troughs are constantly inspected and cleaned by men specially employed for that purpose, and the Committee believe that with the increased overflow alluded to in my last, the risk of contagion is practically nil. Whether they will be able to continue this increased overflow is simply a question of money, as all the water required for the troughs is supplied by meter, and charged for by the various Water Companies. To secure such an overflow for mere cleansing purposes as has been suggested by some members of your Board, we should require certainly not less than 500 gallons a day more at each trough than we now use, and this would involve an addition to the present expenditure of the Association of something like £1,000 a year. The Committee do not know whether, 190 under the Metropolis Local Management Act, August 7th, 1802, Section 70, or any subsequent Act, your Board have power to vote money for such a purpose; but if so, they would suggest that they should exercise that power, and grant the cost of the water which they consider necessary to prevent the risk of contagion at the troughs, at any rate during such period as they shall be of opinion that glanders is increasing in the Metropolis. I am, however, to state that the Committee of the Association still hold very strongly to the belief alluded to in my letter of the 9th ult., that the disease is not really on the increase, but that the exercise of the enormous powers for its detection and suppression conferred upon the Metropolitan Board of "Works and their inspectors by 41 and 42 Vict. cap. 74, is simply bringing into prominence an evil, which before that Act came into full force, in January, 1879, existed almost outside the reach of the law, and therefore comparatively unnoticed, and the Committee feel assured that a continued and still more vigorous exercise of those powers must result in not a glanderel horse being found in the streets of London, and then the public drinking troughs cannot be contaminated. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JOHN LEE, General Manager and Secretary. memorandum on the alleged danger arising from slandered horses drinking at the public cattle troughs. 1. 41 & 42 Vic. cap. 74.—This Act was passed on August lGth, 1878, and came into full force in January, 1879 ; it repeals a similar one passed about ten years ago, prior to which no serious attempt had been made to discover glanders. Under this Act, and the Orders of Council proceeding therefrom, provision is made for the prosecution by the police and the local author ties of persons concealing, exposing, selling, or using horses suffering from glanders or farcy. The Metropolitan Board of Works is appointed the "local authority" for the administration of this Act in the Metropolis, and its inspectors are appointed all over London. Any person having a glandered animal is bound now to report it to the police, and they must report it to the local authority (the Metropolitan Board of Works) or its inspectors (Sec. 31.) 191 1 he police may take action themselves in suspicions cases by detention and arrest without warrant of a magistrate, and an inspector under the Act may do anything which the police may do, and in addition may enter any land or premises where he thinks disease is, or has been, and may order any animal to be destroyed (Sec. 50). The Metropolitan Board of Works, as the "local authority," has also very large powers to prevent animals being moved when a diseased animal has been found, and to kill suspected animals—a terrible power, which makes persons at once report their own diseased animals in order to prevent the local authority intervening. Thus a network of detective power has been organised during the last few years to detect the disease, and a strong inducement has been created to force people to report their own cases direct. 2. In addition to the police restrictions resulting from the above Act, any person watering a glandered horse at a public trough is exposed to detection by the owners and drivers of other horses using these troughs, whose interest it would clearly be to give the offender into custody at once; and when it is known that more than 2,000 horses frequently drink at one trough in a single day, and that a large proportion of these are driven by their owners—who are, in many cases, small tradesmen, carriers, cabmen, and others, whose livelihood depends mainly upon the health of their horses—it is manifest that a public trough is one of the last places to which a mail would bring a glandered horse, as he would thereby almost infallibly expose himself to certain detection and punishment. 3. The vast number of vans, waggons, and other vehicles bearing the names of various railway companies, carriers, coal merchants, builders, and others, which may be constantly seen crowding round the troughs, sufficiently prove that not only small owners driving their own horses, as described in the preceding clause, but most of the larger employers of horse-labour attach no importance to the allegation that they an a source of danger, and this is further strengthened by the foot that in the published list of the supporters of the Association the names of a very large number of horse owners are to be found, many of whom in sending their contributions have said that 192 they regard it as a duty incumbent on all who own horses to contribute towards the support of an Association which does so much to alleviate suffering amongst them, and thus to promote their health and usefulness. 4. It is unreasonable to suppose that any person who would be brutal enough to drive a glandered horse through the streets would be humane enough to care whether it suffered from thirst or not, much less to expose himself to detection and punishment in the desire to give it drink. 5. In addition to the supervision involved in Clauses 1 and 2 of this Memorandum, a stream of fresh water is continually running through the troughs of the Association, and they are constantly inspected and cleaned by men specially employed for that purpose. 6. Although glanders is a disease peculiar to horses, it is well-known that if the poison comes in contact with wounds or abrasions of the skin in human beings malignant sores are produced, and although the men employed by the Association as described in above clause have had their hands daily and continually in the water whilst cleaning these troughs for many years past, and are subject to such abrasions of the skin as are incidental to all who are constantly engaged in rough manual labour, no evil results have ever been known to ensue. 7. As a matter of fact, not a single intimation or complaint has ever been received by the Association since the troughs were first opened some years ago, of a horse having been glandered by drinking at them. (Signed) JOHN LEE, General Manager and Secretary, Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and January, 1881. Cattle Trough Association, Victoria House, Victoria Street, Westminster. In view of the above correspondence, the Vestry on l6th July, 1895, Resolved to invite the views of the London County Council upon the subject and received the following letter under date 25th July, 1895 193 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Spring Gardens, S.W., 25th July, 1895. Sir, In reply to your letter of the 17th instant, I have to inform you that in the opinion of the Council, water troughs may be a source of infection of glanders or farcy, and, as you will see, this possibility was borne in mind when the suggestions were prepared which are appended to the Council's regulations as to glanders or farcy, a copy of which I enclose. I may add that some time since the Commissioner of Police was communicated with by the Council as to the cat-stand hydrants being made available for the use of the public, but it was ascertained that this would involve an additional cost of £600 in respect of existing hydrants, and the Council has no power of expenditure for the purpose. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Clerk of the Vestry (Signed) H. DE LA. HOOKE, of Rotherhithe. Clerk of the Council. [copy of regulations referred to.] LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Diseases of Amimals Act and the Glanders or Farcy Order of 1894. This Order requires every person having, or having had, in his possession or under his charge, any animal affected with Glanders or Farcy, to at once give notice thereof to the police. Any such person failing to give notice is liable to a penally £20. On the police receiving notice, the animal affected will be examined by one of the Council's Veterinary Inspectors. Should it prove to be glandered, all necessary steps for its slaughter and for the removal and destruction of the carcase will taken by and at the expense of the Council. The Council is prepared to pay the sum of two pounds compensation in respect of every glandered or farcied horse as to which proper notice has been yum. 194 Precautions against Glanders. General. 1. Glanders is a contagious disease, and may be communicated to a healthy animal by contact with a diseased animal ; by infected water or food ; or by contact with a manger, utensil, or other thing infected by a diseased animal. 2. Infected horses may give the disease to others long before they show any outward signs of it themselves. 3. A glandered horse may sometimes be kept alive and even at work for a time, during which, although no disease may be visible, it is a source of contagion. 4. The continuance of glanders is largely due to want of promptitude in detecting disease, to delay in killing diseased horses, and in taking proper precautions against infection. It is mainly by the vigilance of owners that the disease can be stamped out. 5. Horses weeded out from studs should not be sold until it has been ascertained that they are free from disease. The present practice of selling weeded-out horses at auction, without such precaution, is a fruitful means of spreading glanders. 6. Healthy studs may be kept free from glanders by the adoption of proper precautions against infection. Suppression of Glanders. 7. When glanders is already in a stud it can be got rid of only by killing all horses infected, and by thoroughly cleansing and disinfecting the premises. 8. The presence of disease in a stud may be ascertained by frequent careful inspection. The injection of mallein by a veterinary surgeon skilled in the work might be adopted in doubtful cases. Directly disease is detected the horse should, as far as practicable, be separated from other horses ; notice should be given to the police ; any place where the 195 horse has been kept should be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected; and all clothing, utensils, and appliances used for it should be destroyed or thoroughly disinfected. 10. Horses that have been in contact with diseased horses, either by standing next them in a stable, working in harness with them, or otherwise, should as far us possible be isolated from other horses, and kept under close observation for a time. 11. When a horse has any discharge from the nostrils, or swelling of the glands under the jaws, it should be at once isolated, and its stall, &c , should be cleansed and disinfected. 12. Horse-keepers should be instructed to give immediate notice to their employers of any ailment, however slight, in the horses under their charge. Precautions against Glanders. 13. Drivers and horse-keepers should frequently be impressed with the danger of letting their horses come into contact with other horses. 14. Drivers should be warned against leaving their horses more than is absolutely necessary when in the streets, as during their absence their horses may come into contact with glandered horses. 15. Drivers should also be warned against allowing their horses to drink at watertroughs at which other horses can drink. 16. Whenever possible, pails should be sent out with vehicles; and watering horses except by means of pails, and with water drawn from a standpipe or tap, should be prohibited. 17. It is important to keep horses under good sanitary conditions, and especially important to well ventilate all stables, both near the roof and near the floor. Symptoms of the Disease. 1. Chronic cough. 2. Thin unthrifty appearance with rapid wasting. 3. Excessive staling. 196 4. Enlargement of the gland (or "jug") under the jaw. 5. Slight sticky discharge from the nose. 6. An ulcerated patch on the membrane which divides the nostrils. 7. Thickened leg. 8. Corded veins. 9. Small lumps (or " buds ") on the hide, which afterwards burst and discharge sticky matter. CAUTION.—All who have anything to do with glandered or farcied animals should bear in mind the following facts:— 1. That the disease can be communicated to man by discharge from the nostrils, or other parts of a diseased animal or carcase. 2. That the disease in man is almost always fatal. 3. That it is specially dangerous for any person with scratches or sores on the hands or face, to handle diseased horses or carcases. 4. That by care and strict attention to cleanliness the danger of inoculation is avoidable. ALFRED SPENCER, Chief Officer. Public Control Department, 21, Whitehall Place, S.W. November, 1894.

Thirty-four Licenses were granted to erect scaffolds and hoardings on the public footpaths and carriageways, for new buildings, alterations, or repairs, a decrease of twenty when compared with the number granted last year. Roads and Footways. No addition has been made to the lengths of roads in the Parish which amount, as reported last year, to 14½ miles. In addition to the general repairs, a large quantity of special works have been executed as enumerated below:— Wyndham Road.—The Apportionments being paid, the footway on the west-side was laid with Victoria stone at the owners expense, the kerb redressed and relaid, and a new three-course channel provided at the expense of the Vestry. The actual cost of the paving works paid for by the abutting owners upon each side of the.street, was £55 19s., or £l 12s. 6d. less than the estimated cost. 206 Dodd's Place and Kinburn Street.—The unpaved portions of these streets, as stated in last year's report, were ordered to be paved at the expense of the owners, and the amounts of my apportionment being paid, except as regards the piece of waste ground, the Vestry ordered the work to be executed, the footways being paved with V ictoria stone. New kerb was provided where none previously existed, and a three-course granite channel provided at the expense of the Vestry; the cost of the work charged amongst the owners amounted to £64 3s. 8d., as against £64 14s. 6d., the estimated cost. Lower Road by Park.—The roadway upon the west side between the tram rails and the kerb, having sunk and become dangerous, it has been relaid to an improved level, the stones being redressed. The kerb was redressed, relaid upon and backed up with concrete. The footway widened by setting back the frontage line opposite the Park, Public Library, and No. 120, and paved with Victoria stone, 9718 square feet of stone being used, the land given up by the London County Council and Library Commissioners being marked by brass lines and letters inserted in the footway. Swan Lane.—The footway upon the east-side, from Rotherhithe Street to No. 82, has been paved with Victoria stone at the expense of the abutting owners, and new kerb and three-course granite channel provided by the Vestry, the cost to the owners being £20 17s. 3d., or £2 19s. less than the estimated cost as apportioned. Clark's Orchard.—This roadway has been repaved with 4 in. by 7 in. granite setts upon a foundation of 6 in. of cement concrete, new granite kerb inserted where required and the remainder redressed, and the footways relaid with redressed York flags. When building the warehouse near the Rotherhithe Street end, the owner gave up a piece of land to widen the roadway, and the Vestry continued the carriageway paving to beyond the centre of the warehouse. Rotherhithe Street.—(Opposite Bull Head Dock). The portion of the Old Dock adjoining Rotherhithe Street has been filled up, the existing buildings demolished, and the frontage line set back so as to provide for a double line of vehicular traffic, the existing kerb and footway relaid, new kerb laid upon the north-side of the street, and the roadway paved with 4 in, by 7 in. granite setts upon a foundation of concrete, the net cost of the Street Improvement amounting to £299 10s. 2d. 207 Silver Street.—This street from its southern entrance in Rotherhithe Street to beyond the Wesleyan Chapel property has been reconstructed, new kerb and footway laid, a three-course and five-course channel provided, the roadway formed with macadam, and rolled with the steam roller. Gomm Road.—The footways upon both sides of this road extending over a greater portion of their length have been relaid, the kerbs reset, and the channels regulated. Rotherhithe Street and Swing Bridge Road.—(Elgar Street to No. 686, Rotherhithe Street.) The footway upon the west side of these roads has been paved with Victoria stone, for a width of 5 feet from the kerb line, at the owners expense, as per the apportionment detailed in last year's report, the actual cost of the work being £141 19s. 1d., as against £143 0s. 4d. the estimated cost. The kerb has been redressed and reset, and a new three-course channel provided at the expense of the Vestry. Rotherhithe New Road and Raymouth Road.—Extensive repairs have been executed to these roads where necessary, and some portions have been relaid the whole width extending from the tram lines to the kerbs. Southwark Park Road.—The footway upon the east side within this parish and extending from the entrance gates of the Park to Slipper's Place, has been relaid and the kerb reset. Rotherhithe Street.—(From No. 158 to Swan Lane corner.) This roadway has been widened by the setting back of the "Royal Standard" p.h. and adjoining land, and the purchase of the house at the corner of Swan Lane; the kerb and footway upon the south-side have been set back and re-laid so as to provide for a double line of vehicular traffic, and the roadway re-paved with 4 in. by 7 in. granite setts upon a cement concrete foundation. The cost of the improvement, exclusive of the purchase of the necessary property, but including £65 6s. for the building of a gable wall to No. 77, Swan Lane, amounts to £225 2s. 4d. 208 The footways have received attention in the following streets:- Derrick Street Osprey Street Paradise Street Aspinden Road Cornick Street Elgar Street Lower Road Ilderton Road Delaford Road Odessa Street St. Mary Church Street Nelldale Road Bush Road Union Road Neptune Street Dog and Duck Passage In the various works throughout the Parish, executed by our own workmen, the following materials have been used:— Broken Guernsey Granite 1593 cubic yards or 1833 tons Thames Ballast 1610½ „ „ Sand 100 „ Stone Lime 55 „ Ground Stone Lime 3 „ Portland Cement 255 tons 3 inch York Flags 2248 square feet Victoria Stone 13580 „ 4 in. by 7 in.

The past winter being exceedingly mild, any slight fall of snow which took place was so small that it did not require any special means for its disposal, and no extra expenses were incurred during the whole season. Unemployed. Very few applications were received of persons out of employment during the past winter, and no especial works were undertaken for their relief. Stone breaking was carried on at Bull Head Dock from 6th December, 1895, to 17th January, 1896 the number of men. employed varying from 11 to 1; 212 tons of granite were broken at a cost of £55 10s. 2d., or about 5s. 3d. per ton. This is exclusive of the Cost of tools, and no extra expense was incurred in superintendence, the men being paid their usual rate of wages of 6d. per hour. Cement Testing Machine. A table pattern cement testing machine has been purchased from Messrs. Bailey & Co., of Salford,at a cost of £15 10s., and an additional set of five moulds from Messrs. Death and Ellwood, of Leicester, at a cost of £4 15s. The machine and moulds have been exceedingly useful during the past year, and especially during the construction of the New Dock and River Walls at the Depot, upon which over 400 tons of cement have been used. Livery consignment has been tested, and in addition to the tests required to comply with the specification, extensive and continuous ones have been made to determine the percentage of increase in strength after the first seven days. Mortuary. During the past year New Mortuary Buildings have been erected from designs prepared by myself and approved by the County Council upon the site of the Old Mortuary. They consist of Non-Infectious Mortuary, 24 feet by 20 feet, Infectious Mortuary and Post Mortem Rooms, 16 feet by 16 feet each. Microscopic Room, 8 feet by 7½ feet, Viewing 212 Lobby and Shell Room. The whole of the buildings are built in hard stock bricks, with band courses and arches in red facing bricks, the only external windows are upon the North side, high up, and consist of iron casements with Beer stone, semi-circular heads, jambs, mullions and cills. The interiors are lined with glazed bricks for a height of 6½ feet, and Keene's parian cement above, finished to a very smooth surface. The whole of the roofs are constructed in pitch pine stained and varnished, covered with Broseley tiles upon tongued and grooved boarding, and surmounted with lanterns and side lights to open, fitted with the most approved opening and closing gearing. The floors are of cement concrete trowelled to a very smooth surface, and laid to proper falls and with perforated cast iron channels down the centre of each, which discharge on to external syphon traps. Water is laid on to each of the rooms; the Post Mortem Room is provided with slate rotary dissecting table, glazed slop sink, and slate slab table, and the Microscopic Room has sink, slate table, lavatory basin, and cupboard. The Viewing Lobby is placed between the Mortuaries, the walls being lined with glazed bricks, with wrought iron roof glazed with Mellowes' patent glazing, and the floor is laid in Mosaic. The Mortuary Yard is paved with tar macadam, and is surrounded with a brick wall having entrances 7 feet wide upon the East and South sides. The drains are all external, and discharge into one inspection chamber placed just within the yard, which is connected to a new 9-inch pipe sewer laid by the Vestry, and discharging into the main sewer in St. Marychurch Street, opposite the Parish Church. Owing to the nature of the ground special precautions were taken as regards the foundations, which were put in by own workmen, and consist practically of a solid block of concrete 2 feet G inches thick, extending over the whole area of the site, and 2 feet 6 inches outside the external face of all the walls. During the execution of the work the old Watch-house at the northern end of the Burial Ground was converted into and used as a temporary mortuary. 218 The old building was commenced to be demolished on 26th April. Foundations for New Buildings commenced 4th May. Foundations for New Buildings finished 21st May. Contractor commenced work 11th June. Contractor completed buildings 15th October. Buildings open for Public Inspection, 6th to 9th November, inclusive. Buildings inspected by 387 persons. Buildings first used as Mortuary, 9th November. The buildings were erected by Messrs. T. White & Son, of Bow, E., the amount of the accepted tender being £998 ; the final accounts as settled by me amount to £993 11s. 3d. Steam Roller. The Steam Roller was delivered by Messrs. Aveling and Porter on the 29th May, and commenced working immediately upon arrival, between that date and the 25th March, 1896, was at work 133 days. Previous to delivery it was weighed in the presence of Mr. Moss and myself, with water tank and coal bunker full, and weighed 12 tons 18 cwts. 3 qrs., the contract weight being 12 tons. The following particulars may be of interest for future reference. Length over all 18 ft. 6 in. Width of roller surface 6 ft. 6 in. Driving wheels 5 ft. 6 in. diameter. Driving wheels 1 ft. 5 in. wide. Front rollers 3ft.8 in diameter. Front rollers 1 ft. 10 in. wide. Total height from top of funnel to ground 9 ft. 10 in. The price delivered was £390. 214 Previous to the purchase of a rollerthe cost of hiring a 10-ton roller was 34s. per day, and for the 133 days would have amounted to £226 2s., so that after deducting the 10 per cent, for depreciation a saving of £114 3s. 8d. has been effected upon the first year's working, and we have always a roller at hand to consolidate the trenches when required. It was engaged in 35 streets in different parts of the parish and was hired for 3 days by the Asylums Board to roll the roadway at the South Wharf, Rotherhithe Street. The cost of working during the above-mentioned period has been as follows:— £ s. d. £ s. d. Driving 38 15 10 Cleaning 8 16 6 Oil, Packing, Coke, etc. 25 6 0 72 18 4 Say 10 per cent. for depreciation and repairs 39 0 0 £111 18 4 Sewers. The following lengths of pipe sewers have been constructed during the year:— 12 in. sewer Risdon Street 33 ft. 12 in. sewer Southwark Park Road 470 ft. 12 in. sewer Ainsty Street 81 ft. 9 in. sewer Mary Street 60 ft. 12 in. sewer Renforth Street 123 ft. 9 in. sewer Hatteraick Street 70 ft. 9 in. sewer Nolan Place 80 ft. 917 ft. 215 In all cases they have been laid to uniform gradients between the points of inspection, laid on and surrounded with cement concrete, with the provision of manholes where required, and flushing manholes at the end of the sewers wherever possible. During the past year, 135¾ cubic yards of deposit have been removed from the sewers, the disposal of which has cost £28 17s. An one-horse flushing cart and two men were employed flushing the sewers upon 105 days, and 1,285 loads of water or 321,250 gallons were used. The carts belonging to the Vestry are practically useless for the work they have to perform ; they only hold about 250 gallons of water and the outlets are much too small; it sometimes takes a quarter of an hour to discharge that quantity, and longer if, as mentioned in my last year's report, a length of hose pipe has to be taken through a house to reach the top of the sewer. The velocity of the water becomes so small that it passes through tlx sewer in a mere dribble, so that it is quite unable to remove any of the solid matter lying in the bottom of the sewer. If this work is to be done as it should be, vans holding from 450 to 500 gallons, and fitted with a large outlet valve, so that the whole contents can be discharged in about 1 minute, must be substituted for the carts, which can be utilised for giving the gullies a flush through during the periods of dry weather to prevent smells arising therefrom. The following sewers have been taken up and relaid to proper gradients:— 9 in. sewer Chilton Street (rear of South-side, East of Croft Street) 108 ft. 9 in. sewer Neptune Court (rear of West side) 110 ft. 278 ft. 1195 ft. 216 Gullies. The gullies in the parish now number 818, being an increase of 9 during the year; they have been regularly cleansed, two men with a horse and van being constantly employed upon this work, which takes about six weeks to get round the Parish. 1052 cubic yards of deposit have been removed from them during the year. A horse and cart has been engaged flushing them out on 135£ days, using 1,763 loads or 440,750 gallons of water. In all cases where new gullies have been inserted I have used cast iron ones, which are double trapped and provided with an inner sludge box, which is emptied weekly by the sweepers. The new gullies have been inserted as follows: Clark's Orchard 2 Burial Ground 2 Eugenia Road 1 Nolan Place 1 Dodds Place 1 Risdon Street 2 Nelldale Boad 1 Forty-seven of the existing gullies have been found with broken traps, and have had new stoneware ones inserted, surrounded with concrete, in the streets as detailed below: Fulford Street 2 Cranham Road 1 Cornick Street 1 Rotherhithe New Road 1 Bisdon Street 1 Aspinden Road 1 Ilderton Road 1 Manor Lane 1 Suffolk Street 2 Neptune Street 1 Plough Road 1 Dilston Grove 2 Maynard Road 3 Hothfield Place 2 Seven Step Alley 1 Gomm Road 1 Chilton Street 1 Neston Street 1 Clare Hall Place 2 Silwood Street 2 Silverlock Street 2 Forsyth Street 2 Westlake Road 2 Kinburn Street 1 Rotherhithe Street 4 Ainsty Street 1 217 Parfitt Road 1 Abbeyfield Road 1 Delaford Road 2 Neptune Court 1 Eugenia Road 1 Lillington Street l The following 5 gullies were found to be without any trap whatever, and have had stoneware ones inserted, surrounded with concrete :— Glebe Road 1 Kinburn Street 1 Lower Road l Slippers Place 2 5 Manholes. New Manholes have been constructed upon the sewers during the year, and provided with heavy cast iron circular covers in the following streets :— Burial Ground 2 Southwark Park Road 8 Croft Street 1 Neptune Court 1 Renforth Street 2 Risdon Street 1 Mary Street 1 Nolan Place 2 The following existing Manholes, which were covered over below the surface of the ground at varying depths, have been brought up to the surface and provided with cast iron circular covers:— Clare Hall Place 1 Abbeyfield Road 1 Old Road 1 Gattaker Street 1 Debnam'sRoad1 Rotherhithe Street 1 Corbette Lane 2 Kenning Street 1 Silwood Street 1 Seven StepAlley 1 Cow Lane 1 Silverlock Street 1 Dilston Grove 2 Aspinden Road 1 Litlington Street 1 218 Drainage Works. One hundred and sixty-eight notices have been received in reference to the redrainage of houses, erection of new houses, etc., as follows Existing Houses redrained 247 Buildings and Premises other than houses drained or redrained 23 New Houses erected or rebuilt and drained 21 Additions and Alterations to Houses 10 Other Buildings 20 House Drains cleansed 23 344 In connection with the above, 86 new connections have been made with the sewers ; of this number 8 were connected to the County Council's mains. The cost charged to the owners for the connections and for the necessary interceptor and inspection chamber under the footway where no forecourt existed, amounted to £379 7s. 2d. Street Watering. At the commencement of the season the pumps were overhauled and painted at a cost of ,£21 19s., and the amount paid for their maintenance, exclusive of the work done by our own employees, was £1 19s. 6d. In June I reported to the Vestry that some of the wells were proving very deficient of water and giving considerable trouble, the "Bed Lion," "Plough Bridge," and "Horns" pumps only yielding two or three loads per day, and that some time must elapse between each lead, and I was instructed on the 2nd July to have three standposts erected and connected with the Company's mains: one near the " Red Lion" p.h., the other two in Rotherhithe Street, but owing to the advancement of the season, and the terms asked by the Kent Company for those in Rotherhithe Street being such as I could not recommend for your approval, only the one near the " Red Lion ' p.h. was erected, that being upon the area of supply of 219 the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, for which we pay 8½d. per 1,000 gallons of water used, and 10s. 6d. per quarter meter rent. The standpost was purchased by the. Vestry from Messrs. Stone & Co., of Deptford, and coat complete, including valves, connecting to main, building chambers for meter and stop valve, and surface box covers £20 7s. 10d. As foreshadowed in my last year's report the number of vans at my disposal was again insufficient for the requirements of the Parish, and the Vestry purchased a Now Rotary Water Van of 400 gallons capacity from Messrs W. Glover & Son, of Warwick, at a cost of £46. The seven other vans and the two flushing carts were repaired and painted by Messrs Oakley & Son, at a cost of £25 3s. 6d. The cost of the street watering amounted to £535 0s. 9d., and is divided as follows: £ s. d. Horse hire and drivers 363 15 0 Labour (pumpers) 167 2 2 Water from standpost, and rent 4 3 7 £535 0 9 727½ horses were hired for the watering, and I estimate the quantity of water used as follows:— Pumped from wells 3,644,920 gallons. Standpost 81,000 ,, Total 3,725,920 Urinals. No addition has been made to the Public Urinals in the Parish .during the year, their number being as stated in last year's report, nine, with accommodation for36 personsat one time. They have been cleaned down and painted by Mr. Cracknell, of Plough Road,at a cost of £29 10s. 220 Owing to the erection of the Town Hall, the Urinal in Neptune Street was removed to the corner of Moodkee Street. As anticipated, the provision of a regulation tap upon each supply pipe, so as to ensure a more uniform consumption of water consistent with the accommodation, with bye pass for flushing purposes, has considerably reduced the quantity of water used, the decrease in the cost of the water for the year amounting to over £30. The cost of the maintenance of the nine urinals for the year was as follows : £ s. d. Wages, urinal man, 52 weeks 84 0 0 Water supply and rent of meters 80 19 9 Hose pipe 0 10 0 Brooms 1 1 4 £166 11 1 The urinals attached to twelve public-houses, in different parts of the Parish, are also cleansed by the urinal man as per the list given in my report of last year. Lighting. At the commencement of the year the Public Lamps in the Parish numbered as follows:— Ordinary Street Lamps 488 Sugg's Patent Lamps 4 10-feet per hour Lamps 2 Large Lanterns 4 498 The lamps upon the Lower Road have been re-arranged, eight new lamps have been erected, one lamp discontinued and the positions of six lamps altered during the year. 221 NEW LAMPS.

Neptune Street, altered position of Urinal. Nelldale Road, owing to additional lamp in street. Swan Lane, on account of street improvement. Lower Road (2), to suit positions of new lamps. When the question of improving the Lighting of the Lower Road was under consideration, I placed myself in communication with the Engineer to the Gas Company as to trying the incandescent burners upon the main roads, and the Vestry accepted his offer to fix six as an experiment. They were fixed in the Union Road on 14th November, between Cathay Street and Paradise Street, but the Company were compelled on 1st January to remove the burner from Lamp No. 22, as the mantles would not stand owing to the continued jarring and vibration caused by the heavy traffic at that point. I he live are still up, and had used, up to the 25th March, as follows:— 55 Mantles. 18 Forks. 3 Chimneys. It is my intention at the end of the experiments, or earlier if 1 can oitain the necessary particulars from the Gas Company, to present to the Vestry a report upon the cost of the lighting with these burners as compared with ordinary street ones. 222 Repairs of Trenches. The repairs to the various Trenches, opened by the Companies under the powers of their respective Acts of Parliament, have been executed by the employees of the \ estry.

Two additional cast-iron name plates with raised letters have been fitted during the year in Corbetts Lane and St. Helena Eoad. Tree Guards. The whole of the tree guards, numbering 28, that were below 6 ft. in height have been altered and made to that height by extension pieces welded to the bottom bars. The additional pieces were made wider than the existing bars and the base of each was specially cramped to ensure same being rigid when fixed. The cost of the alterations amounted to £10 13s. 6d. Watch Boxes. Two new boxes for night watchmen have been made and two thoroughly repaired and altered by the Vestry's carpenter, at a cost of £14 10s. Overhead Wires. As required by the Overhead Wires Act, 1891, and the By-laws made by the County Council, the National Telephone Company have forwarded monthly statements showing the position of the poles erected in the Parish and the number of wires upon each, with particulars of all alterations or additions thereto. Globe Stairs. The embankment at Globe Stairs being in an extremely dangerous condition, and a great portion of it having fallen upon the foreshore of the river, it has been repaired and a concrete wall substituted for the timber sheeting. The consent of the Conservancy was obtained to place the new wall about 4 feet in front of the old sheeting. Re-numbering Orders. Orders have been received from the County Council directing that St. Helena Road shall extend from Rotherhithe New Road to Silwood Street, and that Corbetts Lane shall extend 224 from Silwood Street to Rotherhithe New Road. Name plates have been put up and the houses in both streets re-numbered by the owners, after receiving the notice from me, in accordance with the orders. " Library Drainage. The basement of the Public Library becoming flooded after every severe storm, I was desired by the Commissioners, with the consent of the Vestry, to report upon the cause and suggest a remedy, and upon the receipt of my report the Commissioners requested the Vestry to undertake the alterations suggested therein, and which have been done. New Dock and River Waiis at the Depot. % Having submitted my plans for the adaptation of the Bull Head Dock and Victoria Oil Mills for the use of the Vestry as a Depot, and the Vestry having adopted plan B, and the County Council being satisfied with the plans and estimates, and having given their consent for a loan to enable the works to be carried out, the contract drawings, specifiaation and quantities for the first section were prepared, consisting of river walls, and new dock 100 feet long by 50 feet wide, composed of cement concrete faced with Staffordshire blue bricks coped with Devonshire granite coping, together with timber slop shoots and other works in connection therewith. Advertisements were issued and the contract let to Mr. Thomas Adams, of Wood Green, N., for £8,723 15s. 11d. The work was commenced on the 17th January, 1896, and is now in hand, the whole to be completed within six months from the date of commencement. Apportionments. During the past year apportionments have been served upon the owners of property in the following streets :— Hatteraick Street, Nolan Place, Slippers Place. South side, Plough Road.

To the Chairman and Members of the Rotherhithe Vestry. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report upon the work of my department for the year ending 31st December, 1895. Drainage, Raymouth Road. The question of drainage of the houses, Nos. 73 to 91, Raymouth Road, remained in obeyance at the end of last year. Proceedings were instituted at Greenwich Police Court against the owner for non-compliance with the Statutory Notices issued, who contended the combined drains were a sewer, and repairable at the cost of the Vestry. The magistrate after the second hearing decided in the Vestry's favour, making orders for the work to be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Vestry, and payment of6s. costs in each case. The owner failing to comply with the magistrate's orders in the time specified, further summonses were issued to recover penalties; however, the owner having commenced the works, the summonses were subsequently withdrawn on the completion of the works and on payment of £6 and 6s. costs. Trade Nuisances. Complaints having been received from the inhabitants of Rotherhithe Street. respecting offensive effluvia arising from the premises in the occupation of Messrs. Dick & Co., and the Medical Officer of Health having certified that such was a nuisance or injurious to the health of the surrounding inhabitants, proceedings were instituted and ultimately the defendants were fined £20 and £2 2s. costs. 248 On visiting No. 7, Wormald Place and 26, Fulford Street, I found these premises were used for the purpose of Roker skin dressing. No nuisance was found to exist at 7, Worrnald Place. At 26, Fulford Street, the trade was carried on as to bo a nuisance, and upon the Medical Officer of Health certifying that such was a nuisance, or injurious, or dangerous to health, proceedings were instituted against George Tucker, the occupier. the magistrate adjourned the case for a month on the defendant promising to abate the nuisance, the summonses being subsequently withdrawn upon the payment of 12s. 6d. costs. I attended Greenwich Police Court at the request of the London County Council, as a witness on their behalf, in support of summons against James Judd, of the London and Brighton Railway Company's arches, Rotherhithe New Road, for a contravention of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; the case having been proved against the defendant, the magistrate imposed penalties amounting to £50 11s., including costs. Complaints having been received from Messrs. Croggan & Co., of offensive smells arising from the Railway arches in the occupation of James Judd, and the Medical Officer of Health having certified that such was a nuisance, or injurious to health, proceedings were instituted and the defendant fined £5 and 2s. costs. Workshops. On receiving complaint from Her Majesty's Superintending Inspector of Workshops relative to the dirty condition of a workshop, situated at 36, Cranham Road, Notice was served after inspection to remedy this nuisance, which was complied with. On inspecting the workshop adjoining 36, Ilderton Road, and in the occupation of Messrs. Rogers, I found the sanitary conveniences were insufficient for the workpeople employed there. Notice was served to provide the requisite accommodation, the works being carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor. 249 Licensed Cowhouses. The cowhouses in the parish were under regular inspection during the year. It was found necessary to serve Notices in three cases on the cowkeepers to the effect that their licenses would be opposed at the Special Sessions of the London County Council, unless the requirements of the Vestry were complied with. In two instances the Notices were at once complied with, but in the other case, that of Albion Street, the cowkeeper failing to comply with the Vestry's Notice, I attended the Sessions to oppose the renewal of his license, which was subsequently withdrawn. Bakehouses. The whole of the bakehouses in the Parish were under regular inspection by the Medical Officer of Health and myself. In 12 instances it was found that the premises were not in a proper sanitary condition. Notices were served in each of these cases, calling upon the bakers to comply with the regulations. In each instance the Notice was complied with. Dust and Dust Pails. The Dusting Contract has been carried out satisfactorily and in accordance with the daily schedule. The stock of pails having become exhausted, the Vestry instructed tenders to be issued for a further supply of 250. Disinfecting Van. This van, used for the removal of infected bedding, required to be thoroughly overhauled and painted; instructions were given to the Vestry's contractor to carry out the work, according to estimate submitted. 250 Private Roadway, Lower Road. On serving a notice upon Messrs. Taylor & Walker, of Limehouse, calling their attention to the offensive state of the roadway abutting upon the "China Hall" P.H., a letter was received in reply stating that the roadway in question was not a private but public roadway. The letter was referred to the Law Clerk. inhabited Shed. From information received I visited a shed at the rear of 60, Osprey Street and found it inhabited by a family consisting of seven persons. The shed being totally unfit for habitation, I reported the matter to the Vestry, who ordered a Notice to be served to abate the overcrowding, which had the desired effect. It appeared the man had originally taken the shed as a storage for his barrows. Magistrate's Orders. On the 18th January, I attended Greenwich Police Court in support of five summonses against the owner of Nos. 11 to 15, Hatteraick Street, for non-compliance with the Vestry's Notices. The magistrate made an order for the works to be carried out within 14 days, and for payment of costs. On the 3rd December, I attended Greenwich Police Court to obtain Closing Orders in respect to Nos. 11 to 15, Silver Street. These houses were found to be in such a state as to be unfit for human habitation, and, upon the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, proceedings were instituted under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The magistrate made an order for the closing of the houses and payment of 30/- costs. On the 17th December Notices were served on the occupiers to quit within 14 days, and the houses were subsequently closed. 251 Sate of Food and Drugs Acts. During the year, 84 samples have been purchased for Analysis under these Acts as follows :— Milk 51. Butter 17. Coffee 10. Oatmeal 1. Flour 1. Arrowroot 2. Mustard 2. Proceedings were instituted in all cases of adulteration. The fines and costs amount to £44 1s. 6d. In one instance the defendant, in default of paying the fine, went to prison for 14 days. On the 15th October, I reported to the Vestry "Questions" relating to the purchase of Milk, which were referred to your Sanitary Committee, with a view of making a representation to the Local Government Board on the subject. Inspections and other matters are included in a tabulated statement on the following page. My sincere thanks are due to those who have assisted me in carrying out the numerous duties relating to my department, and providing in many places, healthier homes for the parishioners of Rotherhithe.
