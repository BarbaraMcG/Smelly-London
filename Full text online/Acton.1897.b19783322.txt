ACT 5 8232 THE Urban District Council of Acton. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER, FOR THE YEAR 1897. ACTON: Printed by J. Knowles, Market Place, & Hooper's Mews. ACT 5 THE Urban District Council of Acton. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER, FOR THE YEAR 1897. ACTON: Printed by J. Knowles, Market Place, & Hooper's Mews. The Urban District Council of Acton. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER FOR THE YEAR 1897. To the Chairman and Members of the Acton District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report: together with tables setting forth the Births, Deaths and Sickness in the district during the year 1897. The public health was, upon the whole, satisfactory; the death rate for the year being 15.9 per thousand of the population, and I should have had the satisfaction of recording a much lower rate but for an outbreak of epidemic diarrhoea during the summer months, which was responsible for no less than eighty deaths. In this report I have dealt with the probable causes of the outbreak, and the precautions to be taken in the future with a view of preventing the disease becoming epidemic. The Section of this report which deals with the prevalence of Zymotic disease in the district may, with regard to Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough and Puerperal Fever be called extremely satisfactory, there being not one single death to record from these diseases, and only two deaths from Typhoid Fever, and two from Measles. Though we have no Isolation Hospital at present, yet the Notification Act is of great benefit to the district. In securing authentic reports of the first cases that are recognised, we are able, in many cases, to confine the disease to one house, by educating the people up to their responsibilities as set forth in the Public Health Act, and carefully explaining to them the danger likely to ensue to their neighbour's health from any careless disobedience to our instructions. 4 The system that I have instituted of educating the public by means of Pamphlets and Leaflets has done more to stop exposure of infected persons than any method previously adopted. Although I have persistently and constantly urged upon you the necessity of providing an Isolation Hospital, or making proper and efficient provision for cases of Infectious Disease, I regret that I have been so far unsuccessful. With the exception of Edmonton (where the population in 1896 was estimated at 32,045) Acton is the only parish in Middlesex with a population over 30,000 which has no means of Isolation. Paving, Sewering, and Widening of Streets go on year after year, and cannot but lead to improved health. The old ill-constructed pan closets and defective ashpits are becoming rare, giving place to better arrangements, and the dangerous conditions of house drainage which passed muster at one time, are, I think, entirely cleared away. Among the public works of importance may be mentioned the building of a Cottage Hospital, the gift of Mr. Passmore Edwards, on a site in Gunnersbury Lane, presented by Lord Rothschild. Certain houses unfit for human habitation have been demolished. A special report on the prevalence of Diphtheria during the quarter ending September 30th was presented to you in November. The Inspector reports to me that the state of the Cowsheds and Dairies throughout the district is satisfactory. I have at intervals inspected the district as occasion may have required. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. A. GARRY SIMPSON, Medical Officer of Health. 5 POPULATION. In the middle of 1897 the number of inhabited houses was 5,272; allowing as usual six persons for every occupied house, the population is 31,632, an estimated increase of 2,178 compared with 1896. The following table shows the number of the population and the inhabited houses at the four preceeding censuses. Year. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1861. 610 3,151 1871. 1,568 8,306 1881. 2,844 17,110 1891. 4,084 24,207 BIRTHS. The total number registered was 973 (510 boys and 463 girls.) The birth rate is 307 per thousand persons living. The following table shows the births since 1890. Year. Number of Births. 1890. 704 1891. 772 1892. 763 1893. 831 1894. 834 1895. 874 1896. 894 1897. 973 Birth Rate for London 30.0 per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered was 503, this includes 33 residents of Acton who died in Public Institutions outside the parish. The annual death rate calculated on a population of 31,632 was 15.9 per thousand, as against 15.7 in 1896. The average Death Rate for London was 18.2. 6 The following table shows the various ages at which death occurred in the District:— Under 1 year 193 Under 5 257 1 year and under 5 64 5 years and under 15 24 Over 5 246 15 „ „ 25 19 25 „ „ 65 125 65 „ and upwards 78 503 503 The following table compares the death rate of children under one year per thousand registered births, and the birth rate for the last ten years. Birth Rate Per Thousand. Deaths of Children under 1 year. Per Thousand Registered Births. 1887 28.7 147 1888 31.1 182 1889 34.1 175 1890 28.3 151 1891 30.8 146 1892 30.5 185 1893 31.9 192.5 1894 30.2 160.6 1895 31.6 168.1 1896 30.3 168.9 1897 30.7 198.3 It will be seen that our Infant Mortality is very high; this is explainable by the number of children who died during the summer months from epidemic Diarrhoea. This disease was prevalent all over England during August; in London at this time the deaths of children under one year per thousand births was 243. 7 Epidemic Diarrhoea is due to a Micro-organism, which is capable of leaving its primary abode, the earth, and becoming air borne, obtains opportunity for fastening itself on food ; and from food or organic matter which serves as pabulum, it can manufacture a virulent chemical poison, and this chemical poison is the material cause of Epidemic Diarrhoea. It will thus be evident that the means at the disposal of the Medical Officer of Health to prevent these recurring epidemics is limited, but I think much may be done by the distribution of leaflets, advising amongst other matters :— (i.) The importance of boiling milk. (2.) Only taking in sufficient fermentable food, as is required for the day's use. (3.) Advice as to the conditions under which food can be stored. (4.) Situation of the larder as regards ventilation &c., In the houses of the poorer class the household food is put in a cupboard, or simply exposed in the dwelling, or it may be a sleeping room ; in such cases as these contamination of the food is almost impossible to prevent. ZYMOTIC DEATH RATE. The total number of deaths registered for the Zymotic diseases was 130, no less than 80 being due to diarrhoea. The Zymotic death rate for the year was 4.1 per thousand of the population. 8 In the following table the death rate and Zymotic death rate are so arranged that comparison can be made for the last ten years. 1888. 1889. 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897.

There were 221 notified, as against 259 in 1896. The following table gives the number reported each year since the Act came into force. 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897.

No cases have been notified since 1894, and no deaths have occurred in the district during the last thirteen years. It is very probable that great changes will shortly be inaugurated by the Local Government Board with reference to the system of Vaccination. We shall have the use of humanised lymph prohibited, and vaccine lymph derived from the calf exclusively used for both primary and secondary vaccination. In Germany the system of Vaccinating direct from the Calf has been abandoned as completely as that from Arm to Arm, the use of Glycerinated Calf Lymph having become general throughout the Empire. 10 Ur. Copeman in this country showed some years ago that glycerinated lymph possessed many advantages; but the German Government have extended his investigations, and have turned the results to practical account. It has been proved by competent bacteriologists that, by the admixture to Calf Lymph of 50 per cent, solution of pure Glycerine in sterile water, and storage of the lymph material in tubes, under proper precautions for a term of several weeks, the preparation remains quite active as vaccine, yet all disease producing micro-organisms which may be in the lymph are destroyed or rendered harmless. SCARLET FEVER. Ninety three cases were notified, but not a single death occurred. In 1896 we had only one death. This is a remarkably low death rate, and is highly satisfactory. DIPHTHERIA. Eighty nine cases were notified, and twenty one deaths occurred during the year. Most of the cases were of a purely sporadic form, viz.:— attacking only one or two in a house, and not spreading. In a few of the houses where deaths occurred defective drainage was found and .at once rectified. The long continued inhalation of diluted sewer air tends to produce a general loss of health, especially in children; shown in various ways, and one of these symptoms may be sore throat; or there may be only a condition of depressed vitality, which offers slight resistance to attacks of acute disease. Occasionally a severe form of tonsillitis attacks the occupants of a badly drained house; this form is generally recognised as " Sewer air Throat." These throats are contagious and 11 directly transmissible from person to person, and without a bacteriological examination is made of the membrane on the tonsils or throat, it is difficult to say that these cases are not true Diphtheria. What is more common is to find in these throats not the true bacillus of diphtheria but a microbe that plays an important part in preparing the throat for Diphtheria, by weakening it so that the throat offers less resistance to the action of the specific organism. Dampness and moisture in the air of a house is also a strong predisposing factor in the production of Diphtheria outbreaks. MEASLES. In the early spring I caused the following Leaflet to be circulated amongst the poorer class, and it has produced a very beneficial result, as although we had a distinct epidemic in the Autumn there were only two deaths recorded during the year. Instructions to the Public as pegapds Measles. Leaflet Issued by the Sanitary Authority of Acton. VERY IMPORTANT TO PARENTS. In order that you may take steps to prevent Measles becoming prevalent here during the coming Spring, it is important that you should know the following facts :— Measles is a dangerous disease and must not be neglected ; it is also most contagious from the commencement of the attack, and remains so for four weeks. Measles begins with symptoms of a severe cold, watering of the eyes, running of the nose, pain in forehead, and irritable cough. At this stage, before the rash appears, the disease is extremely Catching. 12 Look upon all colds with suspicion just now, and keep any child with the above symptoms in a warm room to himself. Send at Once for Medical Assistance. It is dangerous for parents to trust to household remedies. On the fourth day a rash appears, first on the forehead and face, in the form of minute dots of a dull red or raspberry colour, many of the spots join together.) The great danger in Measles is the tendency of the cold to spread to the lungs. So All Exposure to Cold Must be Avoided. The Infection of Measles is easily conveyed by the clothing of persons not themselves attacked by the disease. Should you have the disease in your home, forbid your house to ALL, and let nobody from your house go into any one else's. Clothing and bed clothes should be disinfected by being well boiled in water. Any articles which will not bear toiling should be thoroughly washed with Carbolic Soap, and then freely exposed to the out-door air. G. A. GARRY SIMPSON, East Acton, W. Medical Officer of Health. TYPHOID FEVER. Ten cases were recorded, and two deaths occurred. It will be noticed that we have had only eight deaths from Typhoid Fever during the last four years. 13 PUERPERAL FEVER. No cases were notified. There were 973 confinements during the year. WATER SUPPLY. No complaints reached me during the year. An analysis was made of a sample on October 9th, and the report was satisfactory. DRAINAGE. The only sewers laid down during the year were short lengths in Bedford Park and Acton Lane. NUISANCES. Reference to the subjoined report of your Sanitary Inspector will show the various classes under which these have been treated. 14 REPORT OF SANITARY INSPECTOR For the year ending December 31st, 1897.
