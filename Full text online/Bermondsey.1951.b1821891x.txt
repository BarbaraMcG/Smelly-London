HEALTH AND EDUCATION LECTURES AND FILM DISPLAYS The following lectures and film displays were given during the year:— To Youth Clubs and Children's Organisations 27 attended by 3,865 „ Adult Organisations 112 „ 5,184 139 9,049 Included in the above figures are 12 lectures given by the Sanitary Inspector responsible for catering establishments to factory canteen staffs, caterers and their staffs, etc. This series began in the latter part of the year and opened an intensified campaign for the clean handling of food. Each lecture was illustrated by film strips and cine film. Over 400 persons attended these lectures. ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGN Assistance was again given to the Road Safety Sub-Committee during the year, the number of film displays given being 20 with a total attendance of 4,930. CIVIL DEFENCE CORPS Films, film strips and lantern slides have all been used by lecturers and instructors in training members of the Civil Defence Corps. Such means of teaching are invaluable and it is regretted that there are not more good films available for this purpose. There were 16 lectures illustrated by films during the year. SUMMARY The total number of lectures with films and film displays given during 1951 was 175 with an attendance of 14,290. These necessitated the use of about 125 films, some of which were of general interest as well as those of specific propaganda and teaching value. Audiences varied from about 30 women at a " Mothers' Meeting" or 50 adolescents at a Youth Club to 300 adults at displays in the Council's halls. Wherever an audience was to be found or got together propaganda of one kind or another was carried on. V.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION HOUSING. During the year 1951 no insanitary areas have been reported or declared by the Council, but Demolition Orders under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, have been made on 12 unfit houses, and Closing Orders under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, have been made on 2 parts of houses, involving altogether the displacement of 45 persons. 6 Closing Orders were determined during the year. A block of 41 flats and 1 shop was completed at Neckinger Estate continuation. Accommodation for 117 families was provided during 1951 in properties controlled by this Council and 291 exchanges or transfers were arranged, providing improved accommodation for tenants. A further 313 Bermondsey families were accommodated by the London County Council during 1951, 75 of these having been specially recommended by the Bermondsey Borough Council. Notification has been received that one Bermondsey family has been re-housed in a New Town. HOUSING ACT, 1936 —OVERCROWDING.

The Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 234, requires the Borough Council to provide a proper place for the reception of dead bodies before interment. The Regional Hospital Board acts as agent for the Borough Council in this matter and receives into the mortuary at St. Olave's Hospital those bodies for which it is the duty of the Borough Council to provide. A fee of one guinea per body is paid by the Borough Council for this service.

Thirteen further summonses were dealt with as follows: 3 were adjourned sine die owing to the continued illness of police witnesses, 2 were adjourned sine die as the defendant had been called up for military service, 4 were dismissed as the magistrate was not satisfied that the evidence was conclusive, and 4 were marked "Not separately dealt with", the defendants having been convicted and fined for offences committed on the same day. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948—SECTION 47 On Friday, 9th November, 1951, I was asked by the District Sanitary Inspector to visit a flat in Bermondsey, his attention having been drawn to the conditions there by the owners who had visited in connection with its redecoration. The flat consisted of a small kitchen, a smaller bedroom, a separate W.C. and a tiny scullery. The premises were exceedingly dirty and verminous; there was almost no furniture, but there was a small iron bedstead in the bedroom and another in the kitchen on each of which was a filthy mattress but no bed-clothes. The two occupants, both old women, were not related to one another; they were personally filthy and did not appear to have washed for many days. I endeavoured to persuade these two old ladies, whose respective ages were 86 and 73, to agree to be removed to an Institution where they could get proper care and cleansing, and I promised that while they were away the flat would be redecorated and prepared for their return. I suggested that this would require at least a fortnight, but both old ladies refused to consider going away. I visited the flat on three subsequent occasions and eventually persuaded one of the ladies to go to relatives, and the other one promised at the same time to go into an Institution. Unfortunately, in the first case, the relatives refused to take her, and she was ultimately removed to Newington Lodge Institution, S.E.17, with her own consent. In the meantime the other lady had disappeared and could not be found; when she did return to the flat she was helplessly drunk. I visited her again with the Chief Inspector and found her still too drunk to stand or speak coherently, and there was on the table in front of her a teacup one-third full of methylated spirits and three empty bottles which appeared also to have held methylated spirits. Later on the same day I visited again, accompanied by the Chief Inspector and Dr. Mary Nixon of St. Olave's Hospital, and Dr. Nixon and I signed a certificate in accordance with Section I(1) of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, and the necessary Order under Section 3 of that Act was made by a Justice of the Peace for the County of London for a period of fourteen days, whereupon she was removed by ambulance to Newington Lodge Institution, S.E.17. The owners of the flat were notified and the flat was disinfected in preparation for the workmen, after which it was redecorated. The old lady who had voluntarily entered an Institution returned to the flat after its redecoration. The one removed by the Order decided to remain in the Institution and is still there.

On examination by the Wharves and Food Inspector at the wharf the bottles were found to contain a preparation known as " Dutch Drops " and a sample was submitted for analysis. The accompanying literature made claims some of which were in contravention of the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. The labels did not disclose the names of the ingredients used, and a " Stop " Notice was placed on the goods. Subsequently the importer was interviewed and gave an undertaking to destroy the literature and have the labels corrected to comply with the Act. UNSOUND FOOD.
