FUL 1 Destrn of the Parish of Fulham. Annual Report OF THE Medieal Officer of Health, J. CHARLES JACKSON. For the Year ending December 31st, 1893. FUL 1 Town Hall, Fulham. To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you the Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year ending December 31st, 1893. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census of 1891 was 91,640, and in the middle of 1893 was estimated to be 104,735, on the assumption that the rates of increase which prevailed between 1881 and 1891 have been maintained. That the population is still increasing at the same remarkable rate that it did between 1881 and 1891, during which period it increased from 42,900 to 91,640, is shown by the increase in the number of inhabited houses in the parish as given in the following table:— 1881—Number of inhabited houses in Fulham 6,685 1891 „ „ „ „ 13,496 1892 „ „ „ „ 14,407 1893 „ „ „ „ 14,906 The increase for the last two years being at the rate of 714 houses a year, as against 681 a year during the previous inter-censal period of 10 years. SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE INHABITANTS. In the Census of 1891 each head of family or occupier living in less than five rooms was asked to state the number of rooms occupied, so that from the amount of overcrowding some idea may be gathered 4 of the conditions under which a large proportion of the population lives. The results taken from a return recently issued by the Registrar-General are as follows :— in tenement Number of tenements with lessthan 5 rooms. Number of Occupants of Tenements. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Eleven 12 or more 1 2245 951 660 374 181 54 17 7 1 - - - - 2 3200 317 864 730 561 377 210 95 31 12 - 2 1 3 5028 174 967 1009 904 748 589 347 170 85 23 9 3 4 2958 41 316 442 504 465 440 355 215 122 36 12 10 51,138, or 55 per cent. of the total population, were therefore at the time of the Census living in tenements of less than five rooms and they may be classified as follows:- Class A. 4 or more persons to each room 1579 or 1'7 per cent. of total Class B. population 3 and under 4 persons to each room, 4261 ,, 4.6 „ „ Class C. Under 3 and over 2 „ ,, 7265 ,, 8.0 „ „ Class D. 2 persons to a room 8818 „ 9.6 „ „ Class E. 1 and under 2 persons to each room, 24718 „ 26 .9 „ „ Class F. Less than 1 person to each room 4497 „ 4.9 „ „ The following comparison with the whole of London may be o interest:— fulham. london. Class A 1.7 4.4 „ B 4.6 7.2 „ c 8.0 9.2 „ D 9.6 9.3 „ E 26.9 23.0 „ F 4.9 3.7 55.7 56.8 5 Although the number of rooms and occupants cannot be taken as an absolutely sure guide, as rooms may differ considerably in size, still it is certain that the rooms in tenements with less than five rooms will not as a rule be large, especially in Fulham where the great majority of these tenements are in small houses and not as in some parts of London in large old houses with proportionally large rooms, so that tenements with more than two occupants to a room must be considered overcrowded. The first three classes, then, constituting 14.5 per cent. of the population, are living in an over-crowded condition. Class D, too, constituting another 9 per cent. of the population, must also be considered as living too closely packed and are in all probability very poor, as poverty and crowding in Fulham where rents are low go hand in hand together. In fact the amount of crowding in Fulham agrees pretty closely with the amount of poverty as ascertained by the careful enquiries of Mr. Charles Booth, who, in his "Life and Labour of the People," gives the following classification of the population of Fulham:- Living in comfort 74.6 per cent. Living in poverty 25.4 „ These being subdivided into the following classes:— Living in Poverty. per cent. Class 1. The lowest class, occasional labourers, loafers, &c. 1.3 „ 2. The very poor, casual labour, hand-to-mouth existence, chronic want 5.4 „ 3. The poor, including alike those whose earnings are small because of irregularity of employment and those whose work though regular is ill-paid 18.6 25.4 Living in Comfort. per cent. Class 4. The regularly employed and fairly well paid working class of all grades 42.4 „ 5. Lower and upper middle class and all above that level 32.2 74.6 B 6 The distribution of these classes in the various districts of the parish being :— Boundaries of District.

The following table gives the number of persons living at different ages in Fulham and London expressed in percentages of the total population:— 7 FULHAM. LONDON. Under 5 14.1 11.9 5 to 10 12.4 10.7 10 „ 15 10.1 9.8 15 „ 20 8.3 9.9 20 „ 25 8.9 10.2 25 „ 35 18 .0 17.3 35 „ 45 12.7 12.4 45 „ 55 7.8 8.7 55 „ 65 4.5 5.2 65 „ 75 2.4 2.9 Over 75 0.8 1.0 100.0 100.0 The age constitution of a district is of importance in considering the death rate and especially the Zymotic death rate, as some of the most prevalent of these diseases as Diarrhoea, Whooping Cough, and Measles are mainly fatal to young children, consequently a large proportion of children under 5 in a population must give rise to a relatively high Zymotic death rate. Comparing Fulham with the neighbouring parishes a great difference will be found in the proportion of children under 5 in the respective populations :— No. of Children under 5. Fulham 14.1 per cent. of population. Hammersmith 12.0 „ „ Chelsea 11.0 „ „ Kensington 8.1 „ „ St. George's, Hanover Square 7.2 „ „ AREA AND DENSITY OF POPULATION. The area of Fulham is 1701 acres and there are 61 persons to the acre. A considerable portion of the parish, probably some 450 acres lying chiefly in the southern and western portions of the district, is still unbuilt on, so these figures give a misleading idea of the actual 8 density of the population ; thus in four of the enumeration districts in the centre of the parish with a total population of about 9,000, there are 270 persons to the acre. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages which took place in Fulham during 1893 was 735, against 759 and 705 during the two preceding years. The marriage rate, i.e., persons married per 1000 inhabitants, was 14.5, the rate for the whole of London being 17.1, and for England and Wales, 14.6 BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. 3711 births were registered during the year, of these 1860 were males and 1851 were females. There was one birth to every 28.2 inhabitants, the birth rate being 35.4, considerably above that for the whole of London which was 30.9. Illegitimate Children. The births of illegitimate children were 166, 95 males and 71 females, forming 4.5 per cent. of the total births. Still-born Children. 184 still-born children were buried in the Fulham Cemetery, representing a proportion of one still-born child in every 20 births. A record of still-births is much needed and among the recommendations of the Select Committee of the House of Commons for the improvement of Death Certification and Registration is one to the effect that still-births which have reached the stage of development of seven months should be registered upon the certificate of a registered medical practitioner, and that it should not be permitted to bury or otherwise dispose of the still-birth until an order for burial has been issued by the registrar. This is certainly desirable, but there seems to be no adequate reason why it should apply only to still-births of seven months' gestation and upwards and that cases under that age should be left unprovided for. A medical certificate and an order for burial should be required in every case of still-birth irrespective of the period of gestation. 9 DEATHS AND DEATH RATE. The deaths of 2245 persons were registered in Fulham during the year; but of these 447 were of persons not belonging to the district, while the deaths of 226 parishioners occurred in institutions outside the district. There were, therefore, 2024 deaths of parishioners of Fulham, this number being equivalent to a death rate of 19.3. The death rate for the whole of London for the same period was 20.9. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. Of the 2024 deaths registered, 659 or 32 per cent. were those of children under one year of age. The rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was 177 per 1000 births, the rate for the whole of London being 164 per 1000; the latter exceeding by 11 the average proportion for the preceding ten years. The lowest rate among the London Sanitary Districts was that of Hampstead, with 102 deaths per 1000 births; and the highest that of the Strand, where the proportion was 219 per 1000. The rates in the large towns ranged from 141 in Bristol and Huddersfield; to 220 at Leicester; and 223, 241 and 269 at Barnsley, Blackburn and Preston; and the average rate for the 32 large provincial towns was 193. Childhood. Between the age of one and five years 264 deaths were registered, so that the total number of deaths of children under five years of age numbered 923, or 45.6 per cent. of the total number of deaths. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 62.5 per 1000 of the population estimated to be living at this age. Deaths of Illegitimate Children. The deaths of 72 illegitimate children were registered, of whom 63 were under one year of age; thus the mortality of illegitimate children under one year was in the proportion of 358 deaths per 1000 births, or double the rate of children born in wedlock. Illegitimacy is well known to render the life of infants extremely precarious, the investigations of the commission appointed to examine into the mortality of illegitimate 10 children showed that, the proportion of illegitimate to legitimate children born being on an average about 5 per 1000, not more than 10 per cent. of those lived to grow up. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Acts were issued during the year for 444 children under the age of five years, and 47 for children between the age of five and ten; thus 48 per cent. of the children who died before attaining the age of five were insured. School Age. At the age of 5 to 15, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 100 deaths, corresponding to an annual rate of 4.2 per 1000 of the population estimated to be living at this age. Adolescence. At the age, 15 to 25, 86 deaths were registered, the mortality being 4.7 per 1000 living at this age. Maturity. At the age 25 to 65, 591 deaths were recorded, which was equal to a death rate of 13.1 per 1000 persons estimated to be living at this age. Decline. At 65 and over the deaths of 324 persons were registered or 16 per cent. of the total number of deaths and corresponding to a rate of 96.7 per 1000 of those living at that age. Deaths and Death Rate from Zymotic Diseases. 344 deaths were due to the seven principal Zymotic diseases:— Smallpox 3 Measles 12 Scarlet Fever 34 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 65 Whooping Cough 81 Enteric Fever 16 Diarrhœa 133 344 The death rate from these diseases being 3 3, and the rate for the whole of London, 3.0. 11 NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The following table gives the number of cases of infectious disease notified in Fulham since 1890, when compulsory notification came into force, excluding duplicate notifications:— 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. Scarlatina 286 118 517 701 Diphtheria 70 69 96 230 Membranous Croup 23 13 15 20 Enteric Fever 72 51 41 58 Continued Fever - - - 6 Typhus Fever 2 3 - 1 Smallpox - - 3 30 Cholera - - - 5 Puerperal Fever 6 9 10 18 Erysipelas 114 67 104 153 576 330 786 1222 There is a marked increase in the number of cases of all notifiable infectious diseases as compared with previous years, and this has been the case all over London, and from table H in the appendix which gives the number of cases notified in each Sanitary District during 1893, it will be seen that the position of Fulham, especially when the age distribution of the district is considered, is not unsatisfactory. Smallpox. London was threatened during the year with a formidable epidemic of this disease, as notwithstanding the perfect organization of the Metropolitan Asylum Board's ambulance service, the disease spread rapidly during the first five months of the year, the number of cases under treatment at the Board's Hospitals and at the Highgate Hospital rising steadily from 38 in the first week of January to 570 in the middle of May, the disease then declined till the end of September, there being then 77 cases under treatment in the Hospitals, after this it again 12 showed signs of increased prevalence, and in the middle of November 151 cases were under treatment, since when there has been a slow but regular decline, the number of cases in Hospital numbering 93 on December 31st. In Fulham 32 cases have been notified, but of these 3 were found by the Medical Officer of the River Ambulance Service not to have Smallpox and were not sent on to the Hospital Ships, but were sent back to their homes, one of the cases being detained at the Wharf for six days before a final decision was arrived at. The difficulty of diagnosing many cases of Smallpox is well known and it must be remembered that as London was practically free from Smallpox during the six years prior to 1812, many practitioners have never had the opportunity of seeing cases of the disease, mistakes of this nature must almost of necessity be not infrequent. Thus in 1891, of 90 patients throughout London certified to be suffering from Smallpox and removed from their homes by the Metropolitan Asylum's Board's ambulances, 27 or 30 per cent. proved not to have Smallpox. In 1892 out of 412 cases, 93 or 22 per cent. and this year of 2.557 cases, 274 or 10 per cent. were similarly found to have been incorrectly certified. It is however obvious that as the arrangements of the Managers for removing patients are so admirable, that there can be no danger to the patient in removal, and as the patient is not allowed to proceed to the Hospital Ships and so be exposed to infection until the diagnosis is confirmed, it is better where means of complete isolation are wanting that doubtful cases should be at once notified, so that they can be promptly removed and isolated, than that the risk should be run of spreading the disease broadcast by the neglect, or the impossibility of taking the proper precautions. The disastrous effect of this was shown recently in an adjoining parish, where a case of Smallpox was unrecognized until just before death, with the result that the disease rapidly spread in the neighbourhood and some 70 persons were attacked. Of the cases notified in Fulham all but two were removed, one of these being well isolated, and in the other case the exhaustion consequent on the extreme age of the patient, viz., 85, in the opinion of the Medical attendant forbade removal. Three of the cases proved fatal, being equivalent to a death rate of .03, the rate for the whole of London being .0.4; the average rate for the previous ten years having been .07. The following table gives the age and condition of the patient as regards vaccination, together with the result of the case:— 13 AGE. Cases Cases Vaccinated. Deaths. Unvaccinated. Deaths. Under 1 year - - 1 1 1 to 5 years — — — — 5 „ 10 — — 1 — 10 „ 15 — — — — 15 „ 20 3 — — _ 20 „ 25 5 — — — 25 „ 80 7 — — _ 30 „ 35 2 — — — 35 „ 40 5 — — — 40 „ 50 — — — 50 „ 60 „ 1 — _ _ 60 „7 0 2—1 1 70 „ 80 — — Over 80 — — 1 1 25 0 4 3 It will be noticed that no death occurred among vaccinated persons and that no case occurred among vaccinated children under the age of 15, but the number of cases is too small to warrant any conclusions being drawn from them. Seven cases occurred in the Union Infirmary, the disease being introduced into that institution by a man who had come from the casual ward at Epsom. The frequency with which infectious disease is spread by vagrants is well known and it is certainly most desirable that Sanitary Authorities should obtain further powers in order that as far as possible vagrants may be prevented from carrying infection about the country. Of 63 towns invaded by Smallpox during the last two years, 37 or 53 per cent. had the infection primarily from vagrants, and in many of these towns it was introduced again and again by this class of persons. Scarlet Fever. Epidemic Scarlet Fever has been present in London throughout the year and in Fulham 701 cases have been notified, or 184 in excess of the number notified last year when it was also exceptionally prevalent. Probably the long continuance and the wide-spread character of the epidemic have been partly due to the breakdown of the 14 arrangements of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the provision of Hospital accommodation for cases of infectious illness. At the end of May the accommodation for Scarlet Ferer patients in the Board's Hospitals was exhausted and patients could only be removed as vacancies occurred, through death or recovery, so that although the removal only of the most urgent cases, was requested, a delay of many days often occurred before this could be done; and in some instances the removal was deferred so long, that ultimately the patient remained at home until recovery. There were also many cases where removal was advisable and was desired by the patient or his friends, but no application was made for removal as other more urgent cases were awaiting admission. Some idea of the number of these cases may be gathered from the fact that during the first 21 weeks of the year when the accommodation was ample and cases could be promptly removed, of 228 cases 200 or 87 per cent. were removed; while during the remaining 31 weeks, of 475 cases 243 or only 50 per cent. were removed; so that accommodation was required for about 100 more cases in Fulham alone. The reason of the Managers being unable to cope with the present epidemic of Scarlet Fever was principally due to the opposition raised to their acquisition of additional sites; but they have now succeeded in obtaining vacant land at Lower Tooting, Lewisham and Shooter's Hill, which will suffice for Hospitals containing in all about 1500 beds; and additional buildings are also in course of erection at the Eastern, the South Western and the Western Hospitals, so that when Hospitals are erected on the sites already purchased and land is obtained for one or more Convalescent Hospitals for the Southern Districts, the Managers hope that these will be sufficient accommodation for the ordinary requirements of the Metropolis; but even this additional accommodation would be insufficient to meet the needs of an epidemic such as we have recently experienced, and as unless the system of isolating cases of infectious disease is completely carried out, the money spent in half doing it is simply thrown away, it is to be hoped that the Managers will not relax their efforts to obtain sites for additional Hospitals until provision is made, not merely for the average prevalence of infectious diseases, but for the maximum amount that is likely to occur. When the Hospitals were full, the selection of patients for the beds becoming vacant daily by deaths or discharges was made by the 15 officers employed in the Ambulance Department of the Asylum's Board; but it would be better in future, if unfortunately a similar block should exist, that only those cases should be removed whose removal is requested by the Medical Officer of Health, and as far as possible that priority should be given to cases as suggested by him, as, knowing the circumstances and surrouudings of all the cases in his district, he is in a position to decide what cases are really the most urgent; as it was, the least urgent were sometimes first removed, and in one instance a case was removed in spite of the Acting Medical Officer of Health having telegraphed to the Asylum's Board stating that he considered the case properly isolated and that other really urgent cases were awaiting admission. Mortality.—Of the 445 cases admitted into Hospitals, 25 or 5.6 per cent, proved fatal; among the 256 cases treated at home there were 8 deaths, a mortality of 31 per cent.; the mortality for all cases being 47 per cent. The death rate from the disease per 1000 living was 0.32, the rate for the whole of London being 0.37. and the average rate for the past ten years in London being 0.29. The case mortality shows that the disease though very prevalent was of a mild type, as the average mortality in the Asylums Board's Hospitals for the ten years ending 1892, was 9.3. The difference between the mortality of the cases treated in the Hospitals and of those treated at home was not so marked as usual: in 1892 the mortality among 13093 patients admitted to the Board's Hospitals was 6.4 per cent.; while of 140C2 cases treated, only 2 3 per cent. died. The difference has been described as being partly due to the worse nourished condition of the cases admitted, but it must also be remembered that cases are sometimes admitted in a practically moribund condition. The question of the influence on the mortality from the disease of massing together large numbers of sufferers has not yet been determined; but Dr. Caiger, the Medical Superintendent of the South Western Hospital, has drawn attention to the occurrence of Secondary Diphtheria among Scarlet Fever convalescents on several occasions when the wards were more crowded than usual, the floor space on these occasions being reduced from 144 to 105 square feet; and in view of the new Hospitals about to be erected, these facts should be borne in mind, for though an outcry has been raised in some quarters about the alleged excessive cost of 16 one of the Board's proposed new Hospitals, as this increased cost is due to the fact that more space will be allotted to the patients, economy practised at the expense of the patients can hardly be seriously advocated. The following table gives the Cases and Deaths in Age Periods age. cases. deaths.

Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Diphtheria has shown a greatly-increased prevalence throughout London during the year, 13694 cases being notified, against 5907 and 8349 in the two preceding year. In Fulham, 230 cases of Diphtheria and 20 of Membranous Croup, which is Laryngeal Diphtheria, were notified. Of these 250 cases, 65 proved fatal, a mortality of 26.1 per cent. 119 patients were removed to a Hospital, of whom 37 died, a mortality of 31 per cent. Of the 131 who were treated at home, 28 died, a morality of 21 percent. The difference in the rate of mortality is certainly not greater than we would expect, as many of the patients removed died within a few hours of their admission; while some of the cases treated at home were of a very mild type, as patients when visited on the day of notification were found to be engaged at their ordinary occupation. The 65 deaths from the disease represent a death rate of 0.61 per 1000, the rate for the whole of London being 0.74, and the average number of deaths in Fnlham during the previous six years was 20. 17 Table showing ages of cases of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup and rates of mortality at different ages:— AGE.

The belief once entertained, that Diphtheria was essentially a "filth" disease, has been of late largely modified, and though there can be but little doubt that insanitary conditions must at least predispose to the disease, it is probable that direct infection plays the chief part in spreading it. Attention has been drawn, notably by Dr. Thome, to the increase of Diphtheria coincident with the extension of primary education, and he, in common with others, regards the aggregation of children at school as the most constant of the conditions under which ordinary Diphtheria arises out of the prevalence of indefinite sore throats, which so generally precede and accompany its outburst. No special school influence could be traced in the cases occurring here during the year, as among children attending school there were 99 cases with 23 deaths and 90 cases with 39 deaths among children not attending school; the incidence of the disease, taking into account the relative number of the two classes, being greater on the latter, and in only five of the cases occurring among those not attending school was the disease apparently contracted from another child in the same house who had been attending school. 18 Enteric or Typhoid Fever. 58 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, of which were removed and treated in Hospital, 16 cases proved fatal, representing the high case mortality of 27.5 per cent. In addition to these, another case which was notified as Typhoid ended fatally, but the cause of death was returned as Acute Tuberculosis, a disease which when it occurs without marked symptoms indicating localisation in any particular organ frequently closely simulates Enteric Fever. In ten cases, including three fatal ones, the disease was contracted outside the district. The deaths represent a death rate of .13 per 1000 living, the rate for the whole of London being .16, and the average rate in London during the past ten years .19. The deaths in Fulham from Enteric Fever averaged 11 during the previous seven years. Continued Fever. Six cases were notified. Typhus Fever. One case was notified during the year. The Acting Medical Officer was unable to trace the source of infection and the house was found to be in fair sanitary condition. Cholera. As there were good grounds for apprehending that Cholera, which had not wholly disappeared during the winter from any part of Europe where it had prevailed during the autumn of 1892, would be introduced into London, the Local Government Board issued in June a circular calling the attention of Sanitary Authorities to the responsibilities and duties devolving upon them in connection with the organisation of measures of precaution against the possibie introduction of the disease into London. 19 The Vestry at once appointed a Special Committee empowered to take any steps they might think fit in relation to the threatened epidemic, such as the provision of medical attendance and nursing, and the supply of medicine and disinfectants. The Guardians of the Fulham Union had promised to provide beds for 50 patients at the Union Infirmary, and steps were also taken to obtain sites for the erection of temporary Hospitals and shelters should they have been required, The removal of patients was undertaken by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and arrangements were made by them to establish Ambulance Stations, should the disease have appeared in London in an epidemic form, at the Workhouse, Fulham Palace Road; the Vestry Yard, Munster Road; the Vestry Yard, Trafalgar House, Fulham Road; and the West Wharf, Wandsworth Bridge. Fortunately, however, the disease obtained no real footing in England, although cases were reported at some 30 different places, many of which were in direct communication with Grimsby, where the most serious outbreak occurred. In Fulham, five cases of Cholera were notified, of these four were undoubtedly cases of the so-called English Cholera and two of them proved fatal, both being children aged six and nine respectively. The fifth case, that of a woman aged 54, occurred at the Fulham Union and was notified on September 10th, the patient dying on September 11th. The history of the case and the post-mortem appearances were strongly suggestive of Asiatic Cholera, and Dr. Klein, reporting on the specimen submitted to him, stated "that although the microscopical character of the intestinal contents were not so typical as in the Westminster case, the cultivations were positive and in every respect characteristic of Asiatic Cholera." The woman had been an inmate of the Union for some years and had not been outside for some months, and recently had been engaged in washing there, so that no light can be thrown on the origin of the disease. Besides this only three cases of undoubted Asiatic Cholera are known to have occurred in London, viz.:— Case at Westminster Sept. 6th „ Lambeth „ 12th „ South wark ,, 26th all proving fatal. 20 In consequence of this case, at the request of the Guardians, samples of the water supplied to the Union were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst, who pronounced the water to be of good average quality, but the sample taken from a cistern supplying w.c., the water of which was also used for drinking, was distinctly inferior to that obtained from the main. A careful inspection was also made of tne Workhouse and the Infirmary by Inspector Jones and myself, with the result that the sanitary condition of the building was found to be faulty, and I reported fully on tne matter to the Vestry. A copy of the report was forwarded to the Guardians, who had also instructed their Architect, Mr. Saxon Snell, to make a thorough examination of the sanitary condition of the building, and I was requested by the Guardians to attend a meeting of the Building Committee, to whom the matter had been referred, and the Committee then arranged that the necessary work to remedy the existing defects should be carried out under the superintendence of Mr. Saxon Snell, and this has since been done. Erysipelas. 153 cases of this disease were notified, and it was the cause of 11 deaths—5 being of children under the age of 1 year, and one of a woman three days after confinement. Puerperal Fever. Eighteen cases were notified, six of which, including two of nonparishioners, occurred in the Union Infirmary. Of these 18 cases 14 or 77 per cent. proved fatal, two of the deaths being of non-parishioners. Including the death ascribed to Erysipelas 13 deaths of parishioners were due to Septic poisoning after child-birth, being in the proportion of 3.5 deaths to 1000 births. NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. Twelve deaths were due to this disease, 11 being of children under 5. The death-rate was 0.11, that for London being 0.38. Fulham was exceptionally free from Measles during the year, and the number of deaths from it was much under the average number which for the previous seven year was 77. 21 Whooping Cough. Whooping Cough was the cause of 81 deaths, the average number for the preceding seven years being 54. Of these, 42 were of children under one year of age, and 37 of children between one and five. The death-rates for Fulham and London from this disease were 0.77 and 0.54 respectively. As usual it was most prevalent in the early months of the year, attaining its maximum fatality in April, when there were 19 deaths from it. Although the case mortality of Whooping Cough is low the disease kills more than any other Zymotic disease, except Diarrhoea. Unfortunately it is always looked upon as a very trivial ailment and comparatively little care is taken of the sufferers who generally succumb to one of the pulmonary complications of the disease. Diarrhcea. Under the heading Diarrhcea are included several different affections confounded with one another on account of the presence of Diarrhcea as a symptom, but there is no doubt that Summer Diarrhcea which is so fatal to young children is essentially a specific disease. One hundred and thirty-three deaths were registered from Diarrhcea (the average number for the previous seven years being 92), 110 of which occurred in the four months from June to September. 109 of the deaths were of children under one year of age, the disease being the assigned cause of death in 16 per cent. of those dying at that age from all causes. In addition to these the deaths of 31 infants ascribed to GastroEnteritis and Gastro Enteric Catarrh were probably of the same nature. The death-rate from this disease was 1.2 per 1000 living, a rate nearly double that for London, which was 0.7, and above that obtaining in any of the Metropolitan Sanitary Districts with the exception of Shoreditch and St. George's-in-the-East. This is by no means satisfactory, as of all the factors which contribute to the prevalence of Diarrha filth is the most potent, and the majority of cases of Summer Diarrhœa probably arise from filth infection, of which the vehicle is the food administered to the infant. c 22 In addition to what can be done by the Local Authority to reduce the largely preventable mortality among children from this and other causes by a strict attention to all the details of sanitary administration upon which the healthiness of a district depends, there is a large field for private individual effort to combat the ignorance and carelessness to which so many of the deaths of young children are due, and much good could probably be accomplished by charitable organizations having specially in view the prevention of infant mortality. Influenza. For the fourth successive year Influenza has shown itself in London. During the first nine months of the year it was the cause of 790 deaths in London, and in the middle of November there was a marked extension of the disease the fatal cases rising from 22 in the second week of November to 164 in the second week of December, and it seemed as if there were to be another serious epidemic. The spread of the disease, however, then became checked, and there has been a continuous diminution in the mortality since. In Fulham the deaths recorded were 39, 19 of which occurred during the last month of the year. In 1892 59 deaths were attributed to Influenza, and in 1891, 47. The Vestry distributed a circular among the householders of the parish calling attention to the infectiveness of the disease and the precautions advisable to prevent its spread and stating that the necessary disinfection of rooms, clothing, etc., would be undertaken free of cost. Other Miasmatic Diseases One death was attributed to Chicken-pox, and one to Rotheln or German Measles. Venereal Diseases. To these diseases were attributed 17 deaths, 15 being from Syphilis, the disease in 13 cases being congenital. 23 CLASS III.—DIETIC DISEASES. Eight deaths were directly stated to be due to alcoholic excess and in four cases the disease to which death was attributed was stated to be aggravated by alcohol, but doubtless this addition might be justly made in many more instances. The death of an army pensioner, aged 64, was returned as due to Fatty Degeneration of the Heart accelerated by " want." CLASS IV.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. The number of deaths from disease in this group were 848, being 17 per cent. of the total number of deaths. Of these 151 were due to Phthisis and 80 to other tubercular diseases, as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica and General Tuberculosis, these diseases thus accounting for 11.4 per cent. of all the deaths and it is probable that some of the deaths ascribed to Marasmus, Debility, Convulsions, were also of a tubercular nature. 65 deaths were registered from Cancer, 50 being of persons of 45 years and upwards. Rheumatic Fever was responsible for 24 deaths, and Chronic Rheumatism and Gout for 5. CLASS V.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. From diseases of this class 137 deaths were certified, 83 being of infants from premature birth, atelectasis or non-inflation of lungs, and congenital malformation; and 54 deaths were returned as due to "old age." CLASS VI.—LOCAL DISEASES. The diseases of this group were responsible for 903 deaths or 44 per cent. of the total number, the following being the principal classes :— 1.—Diseases of Nervous System. From these there were 180 deaths, 72 being from Apoplexy, etc., 19 from Insanity and General Paralysis of the Insane, and 42 from Convulsions, 24 2.—Diseases of the Circulatory System. Diseases of the Heart or Blood-vessels, were accountable for 123 deaths. 3.—Diseases of Respiratory System. From these diseases, Phthisis being excluded, there were 406 deaths or 20 per cent, of the deaths from all causes. Of these Pneumonia was responsible for 152, and Bronchitis for 218 deaths. 4.—Diseases of Reproductive System. 14 deaths were recorded in this class, 7 being due to flooding and other accidents of childbirth. The total number of deaths recorded as occurring within 21 days of childbirth were:— Septic Diseases 13 Flooding and other Accidents of Childbirth 7 Influenza 2 Pneumonia 3 Scarlet Fever 2 Phthisis 1 28 Or one death to 132 births. From the other classes of Local Diseases there were 188 deaths. CLASS VIII.—DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE. Various forms of violence caused 63 deaths, as under:— Accident or Negligence. (Falls 15 Fractures and Contusions Run Over 8 (Fall of Building 1 Burns 6 Drowning 5 Poison 3 Infants in Bed 10 Suffocation Infants by Food 2 Otherwise 1 Other Injuries 3 54 25 Suicide. Gunshot Wounds 1 Poisons 6 Cuts 2 9 The death-rate from violence was 0.6, as against 0.77 for London. CLASS VIII.—ILL-DEFINED AND NOT SPECIFIED CAUSES. Under this heading there were 134 deaths, the great majority 113 being certified as due to Debility, Inanition, or Marasmus. CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 2,024 deaths the causes of 1,860 or 91.9 per cent, were duly certified by registered medical practitioners, and of 156 or 7.7 per cent, by the coroner after inquest, while the causes of only 8 or 0 4 per cent, were uncertified. INQUESTS. Of the 155 inquests held on parishioners 127 were held in the parish and 28 at institutions outside. The subjects were males, 82; females, 73 ; and their ages — Under 5 65 5 to 60 66 Over 60 24 91 deaths were due to natural causes, and 64 to violence. Those due to natural causes may be classified as follows:— Zymotic Diseases 7 Tubercular 4 Diseases of Respiratory Organs 23 Diseases of Circulatory System 29 Diseases of Nervous System 15 Other Diseases 13 91 The deaths due to violence have been already classified 26 UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. Six of these were of prematurely-born infants none of whom lived for 24 hours. The other two were of persons aged 55 and 77 and the causes of death were stated to be Cancer and Decay of Nature. The proportion of uncertified deaths was in London 0.9 per cent. and in England and Wales 2.5. The Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the sufficiency of the existing law as to the disposal of the dead, for securing an accurate record of the causes of death in all cases, and especially for detecting them where death may have been due to poison, violence, or criminal neglect, made their report during the year. The most important recommendations in addition to the one respecting still-birth previously alluded to were, that in no case should a death be registered without the production of a certificate of the cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner or by a coroner after inquest. That a registered medical practitioner should be appointed as public medical certifier of the cause of death in which a certificate from a medical practitioner is not forthcoming. That a medical attendant should be required before giving a certificate of death to personally inspect the body. DEATH IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Union Infirmary and Workhouse. This institution, situated in Fulham, serves for the two parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith. 389 deaths occurred in the Infirmary and 25 in the Workhouse . of these 206 were of parishioners of Fulham, and 208 of persons belonging to Hammersmith. Ages :— Under 1 68 1 to 5 26 5 to 60 155 Over 60 165 27 Western Fever Hospital. 272 deaths occurred at the Western Fever Hospital. Of these 41 were of parishioners and 231 of persons belonging to other districts. The deaths were due to Scarlet Fever 161 Diphtheria 93 Enteric Fever 8 Other Diseases 10 272 The deaths of parishioners at public institutions and other places outside the parish numbered 226, and occurred in the following institutions:— St. George's Hospital 46 West London ,, 29 Middlesex ,, 3 Charing Cross ,, 4 King's College ,, 3 Westminster „ 2 St. Bartholomew „ 2 London „ 1 St. Mary's „ 2 St. Thomas's „ 2 University College „ 1 German ,, 2 Queen's Jubilee „ 4 Brompton „ for Diseases of Chest 18 Victoria „ for Children 19 Cancer „ 8 Hospital for Women, Chelsea 5 Hospital for Women, Euston Road 1 National Hospital 2 St. Elizabeth's Hospital 1 Homerton Fever „ 1 Northern Fever Hospital 1 South Western Fever Hospital 7 28 Fountain Fever Hospital 2 North-Western Fever Hospital 10 Hospital Ships 2 Cane Hill Asylum 1 Banstead „ 4 Hanwell „ 5 Leavesden „ 5 Colney Hatch ,, 2 Caterham „ 9 Darenth „ 1 Middlesex ,, Wandsworth 2 Ilford „ 2 Asylum Friern Barnet 1 St. George's Workhouse 1 Chelsea Infirmary 1 Islington „ 1 Home of St. John the Divine 2 Lambeth Workhouse Schools 2 The Convent, Carlisle Place 1 Essex Buildings 1 Wormwood Scrubs Prison 1 Friedenheim 1 221 The following deaths of parishioners were also recorded:— On Metropolitan Railway 2 At Lime Works, King's Road 1 Drowned in River Thames 2 In all 460 deaths or 23 per cent, of the total number occurred in workhouses, hospitals, and public lunatic asylums. The proportion of deaths in institutions was, in the whole of London, 26-9 per cent., and in England and Wales 21.1 per cent. 29 VACCINATION. The following tables, furnished by Mr. Croft, the Vaccination Officer, gives the Vaccination returns for 1892 and for the first six months of 1893, those for the last six months not being yet complete. The returns show that 93 per cent, of the infantile population have been vaccinated. SUPPLEMENTAL RETURN FOR 1892, FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Births Registered from 1st Jan., 1892, to 31st Dec., 1892. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. 3,518 2,930 14 — 341 21 203 9 RETURN OF VACCINATION FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO JUNE, 1893. PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Births Registered from 1st Jan. to30th June. 1893. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. 1,862 1,404 14 — 243 46 147 8 A Bill was introduced into Parliament during the year to give effect to the opinion expressed in the interim report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination, to the effect that repeated prosecutions for the same child under the Vaccination Acts should cease, and that persons convicted under those Acts should not be liable to be treated as criminals. It proposed that " a person shall not be liable under Section 29 or Section 31 of the Vaccination Act, 1867, to any penalty for a second or subsequent offence. When a person is committed to prison for non-payment under either of those Sections he shall be dealt with in like manner as if he had been committed to prison for nonpayment of a civil debt." The Bill was however withdrawn by the Government, D 30 DISINFECTION. Infected articles were disinfected by the contractor, Mr. Lacy, Townmead Wharf, by whom the articles were also collected. Mr. Lacy's disinfecting plant is of the most approved pattern and has proved fully equal to all demands made upon it. The infected articles were always promptly removed, and the work most efficiently done. The weight of the articles disinfected was 1,345 cwt., and the amount paid by the Vestry to Mr. Lacy £850 11S. od. The three years contract between Mr. Lacy and the Vestry expired last October, and I reported fully to the Vestry on the question of the advisability of their undertaking the disinfection themselves, but as they have at present no site suitable for the erection of the necessary apparatus, the matter has been for the present postponed, and the disinfection is carried out by Mr. Lacy as heretofore. Accommodation for Temporary Shelter. The necessity for the acquisition of some premises where persons can be temporarily housed during the disinfection of their dwellings has been brought under the notice of the Vestry, as the want of this accommodation was on several occasions severely felt, and the Vestry decided that a shelter should be provided; but the matter is standing over, as, could some suitable site be obtained for the erection of disinfecting apparatus, it would be advisable to also provide the necessary shelter there. PUBLIC MORTUARY. 130 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows :— At the request of the Coroner 107 Brought in by the Police 11 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 12 130 Six of the last being cases of infectious disease. Inquests were held on 111, and post-mortem examinations were made in 95 of the above cases. 31 HOUSE REFUSE. There is now a weekly collection of house refuse by the Vestry, and the service has been fairly satisfactory; 470 complaints of nonremoval of dust were received, and a very large proportion of these were due to the refusal of the servants to allow the refuse to be removed when the usual weekly call was made. In 1892 780 complaints were received, and in 1891 3,800, so that the improvement in the service is manifest. REMOVAL OF OFFAL.—OFFENSIVE MATTER. The By-laws made by the London County Council under Section 16 of the Public Health (London) Act prescribing the times for the removal of any offensive or noxious matter and providing for the proper construction of the carriage or vessel used therefore came into force on July 1st. The attention of persons removing offal and other refuse was at once drawn to these By-laws, and the contractor who removes all the fish offal from the parish after some correspondence undertook to comply with them, which he has done, but no attention was paid to them by the persons removing bones and other refuse from butchers' shops, though these are frequently most offensive. Consequently proceedings were instituted against Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co. for carrying offensive matter—to wit, bones and fat, from butchers' shops through the streets during the hours prohibited by the By-laws of the L.C.C. After these proceedings were instituted the Defendants complied with the By-laws, and on their Counsel undertaking that they would continue to observe them pending an application to the L.C.C., to define whether such a business was" within the meaning of the By-laws, the summons was withdrawn. Sewer Ventilation. The smells from the man-holes and the surface ventilators of the sewers in the roadway gave rise to general complaint throughout the parish, especially during the hot season; and there is no doubt that the present system of only imperfectly ventilating the sewers causes a most serious nuisance. The Surveyor to the Vestry has repeatedly recommended that more efficient ventilation be secured by having the open grids not more than 60 yards apart, and by the erection of 32 ventilating pipes wherever possible, but unfortunately there is considerable difficulty in obtaining the consent of owners to these being carried up their own houses, though they are always anxious to see them on their neighbour's property, so that during the year only ten of these have been put up. It is to be greatly regretted, too, that, although hundreds of houses are built yearly, in no single instance has the Vestry's recommendation "urging on builders the desirability of providing and fixing ventilators up the fronts of the houses between the syphon trap and the sewer" being acted on. If this were done, and it could be done, when building, at a trifling cost, much future trouble would be avoided. Remedying the defective ventilation and reconstructing very defective sewers must however necessarily be a work of time, but in the meanwhile much might be done by cleansing, more frequent flushing, and the use of deodorants to mitigate the nuisance. Mr. Laws, in his report to the London County Council on sewer air investigation, says " The carbonic acid in the Fulham Road sewer reached the abnormally high percentage of 93-1 per 10,000. The sewer contained a large amount of heavy deposit, and was otherwise in a filthy condition. It was practically unventilated, as nearly all the ventilators had been closed for some time past owing to the number of complaints about the bad smell," so that there is evidently room for improvement in this direction. The Surveyor, however, has pointed out that, owing to the surcharging of the western sewer belonging to the County Council, which occurs after heavy rainfall, the subsidence of the sewage in the sewers of the district must be very gradual, and that such gradual subsidence leads to large deposits of solid matter; and, further, that the flooding of the basements in the neighbourhood of Greyhound Road and in the Broadway is due to the insufficient size of their main sewer or to the inadequate pumping power at the Victoria pumping station. The smells from the main County Council sewers were, if anything, rather worse than those from the parish sewers, and so numerous were the complaints of the offensive emanations from the Harwood Road sewer that the Vestry saw fit to take proceedings against the London County Council to compel them to abate the nuisance, but the summons was dismissed on technical grounds. A sample of the air taken from their sewer was found by Mr. Clayton, the Public Analyst, to contain the enormous amount of 4.5 per cent, of Carbon Dioxide and .07 per cent, of Ammonia. 33 Since these proceedings a Reeling's sewer gas destructor, an arrangement of a lamp column with a 6-inch connexion from the sewer for passing sewer air through an atmospheric gas-burner fixed in the base of the column, the outlet being about ten feet above the ground. A consumption of about eight feet of gas per hour is said to be required to keep it burning, which produces a heat of about 600° F. at the burner and about 100° F. at the outlet, where the velocity is about 200 feet per minute, or equal to about 40 cubic feet per minute of air extracted. This apparatus seemed to act satisfactorily, and while it was in use there were no complaints of offensive smells. But it appears that there is danger attending the use of gas in these destructors as explosions are liable to occur, and in consequence of this the Directors of the Gas Light and Coke Company decided to discontinue the supply of gas to these apparatus wherever fixed in the Company's district, so that the " destructor " is now not used. WATER SUPPLY. All the houses in the district supplied by the Chelsea Water Company, embracing all that portion of the parish lying to the south of the Lillie Road, have now a constant service, and in the remainder of the parish which is supplied by the West Middlesex Company 5,406 houses have a constant service and 660 an intermittent service, but the Company expect that within a few months all the houses in the district supplied by them will have a constant service. On the 19th and 20th of August that portion of the parish served by the Chelsea Water Company was practically without water and the inhabitants had to be supplied by the Vestry's water carts, which obtained a supply from the West Middlesex stand-pipes. The Company's excuse was that the failure was due to a serious accident of an unavoidable nature to one of the large pumping mains, and they also stated that householders in this parish had suffered more than those in other parts of the Company's district owing to the inadequate size of the cisterns, especially in those parts under constant supply. The Vestry considered the explanation unsatisfactory, as the parish ought not to be dependent on the entirety of one pumping main, and as one of the advantages of a constant supply is that large cisterns with their attendant evils can be dispensed with the relevancy of the latter excuse was not evident. A copy of the correspondence on the matter was forwarded to the London County Council. 34 Water Cut Off by the Water Companies. During the year notices under Section 49 of the Public Health Act were given by the companies that the water had been cut off from 211 occupied houses. The Vestry in all these cases refused to take any action, though in so doing they were acting illegally, as Section 48 enacts "that an occupied house without a proper and sufficient supply of water shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under this act, and if it is a dwelling house shall be deemed unfit for human habitation."Doubtless it is most undesirable that the Water Companies should have this power to cut off the supply of water and so create a nuisance, and that the Sanitary Authority should be placed in the position of debt collectors for the companies; but until they are deprived of this power the Vestry are adopting a most unwise and unjustifiable course in deliberately refusing to carry out the provisions of the Public Health Act, which they are bound to administer. As the water from six shallow wells situated in South Fulham was used for drinking and domestic purposes, samples of the water from them were taken and analysed. All were found to be exceptionally hard, and with one exception were unfit for drinking. The following analysis is an average specimen. The results are expessed in grains per gallon: Total Solids 123.6 Volatile „ 10.14 Free Ammonia 0.0033 Organic „ 0.0092 Nitrogen in Nitrates 3.13 Chlorine 8.33 Oxygen absorbed in four hours 0.115 Temporary hardness 12.8 Permanent „ 45.3 Total „ 58.6 Steps have been taken under Section 54 of the Public Health (London) Act to prevent the water being used for drinking and domestic purposes. The report of the Royal Commission on the Water Supply of the Metropolis has recently been issued. The scope of the enquiry instituted by them was whether the present sources of supply are 35 adequate in quantity and quality, and, if not, whether such supply can be obtained without going outside the watersheds of the Thames and Lea. They find that the water as at present supplied is of a high standard of excellence and purity, and they consider that it can be used without danger provided there is adequate storage and efficient filtration. As to quantity they show that a very large addition to the present powers of supply of the Companies will be needed in order to meet the requirements of the next forty years, but they find that the means of satisfying these requirements exist within the watersheds of the Thames and Lea, and can be made available by storage reservoirs, increased abstraction of water from the rivers and the sinking of wells in the chalk. They add important recommendations for the prevention of the pollution of the rivers and for insuring the proper filtration of the water after abstraction. The report has been freely criticised, mainly on the ground that it cannot be considered as a final settlement of the question, as the Commissioners have limited their forecast to a term of 40 years. It has been pointed out that the capacity of the Thames and Lea watersheds as sources of supply will reach their limit about the year 1931, and then it will be impossible to avoid turning to some outside source; and by that time the best gathering grounds in the country, which are already being rapidly taken possession of by other municipalities, may be lost to London. Mr. Binnie, engineer to the London County Council, says that, bearing in mind the long time which is required for the vast works necessary in large water schemes, at some not very distant date—probably twenty years hence—the people of London will have to contemplate the exhaustion of the supplies which can be obtained in the Thames valley and the necessity of looking elsewhere for an increased supply. And with regard to the quality of the water it has also been pointed out by Mr. Binnie that "there is a population of upwards of a million "persons, and steadily increasing; draining into the Thames above the "intakes of the Water Companies ; and, that, besides the human "population, there are probably 1,600,000 animals inhabiting the above "area. Consequently," he says, " it is clear that if the Thames is to be "retained as a source of supply, the people of London must drink the "more or less clarified excreta of this vast population. That, with "regard to the purification of this water, Dr. Frankland has stated that "the river is the common waterway for a large quantity of polluting 36 "matter, some of which is dangerous to the health of the persons using "the water for dietetic purposes, and that it is practically impossible to "keep sewage or sewage effluents out of the river, and though there is "no positive evidence that the filtered water is unwholesome, the lives "of a large community ought not to be dependent on the efficient "filtering plant of commercial companies. Under present circumstances "a serious epidemic of typhoid or cholera in the Thames basin above "the intakes would be attended with great risk to the water drinkers of "London. Such experiments should not be tried upon large communi"ties. Before the cholera outbreak of 1849 it was believed that Thames "water taken between bridges in London was perfectly safe, as testified "by the evidence of many eminent experts, but the belief cost London "25,000 lives in 1849 and 1854, and his opinion is that the Thames ought "to be abandoned as soon as practicable for the supply of London. "Sir George Buchanan also is of opinion that, as contaminated waters "do under certain unknown conditions produce disease, but that neither "by chemical, microscopical nor bacteriological examination can the "cause be detected, the only really reasonable course to adopt when a "water is known to be polluted as the Thames is, is to avoid its use." Attention, too, has been drawn to the fact that the Commissioners have not accepted the conclusions drawn by Dr. Barry in his report on the enteric fever in the Tees valley, in which he shows that in his opinion typhoid fever was spread broadcast by water drawn from a sewagepolluted river, and have come to the conclusion that such a thing was impossible, or at least infinitely improbable, though Dr. Thorne-Thome has stated " that seldom, if ever, has the proof of the relation of water so befouled to wholesale occurrence of enteric fever been more obvious and patent" than in this case of the Tees, the bearing of which on the purity of the London water supply the Commissioners have refused to admit. In the face of these criticisms of the report it must be obvious that the decision of the Commissioners cannot be regarded as final. Certificates under Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890 and 1891. Certificates for exemption from Inhabited House Duty have been granted in respect of 61 houses containing 137 dwellings, and refused in respect of 32 houses containing 90 dwellings. 37 Factory and Workshop Act, 1891. Increased duties have been placed on the Sanitary staff by the above Act, and the circular issued by the Home Secretary relating to outworkers, but with the existing number of Inspectors it is not possible to attend to them thoroughly, so that the Act in Fulham is almost a "dead letter." Bye-Laws under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Bye-Laws have been made by the Vestry and approved by the Local Government Board: Under Section 16, "for the prevention of particular nuisances" ;under Section 39, "with respect to the keeping of water closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action"; and under Section 50, " for securing the cleanliness and freedom from pollution of tanks, cisterns and other receptacles used for storing water, used or likely to be used by man for drinking and domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man."Bye-Laws have also been made by the Vestry, but have not yet been confirmed by the Local Government Board, under Section 94, in respect of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. These Bye-Laws, together with the Bye-Laws made by the London County Council, are appended to this report. Bye-Laws under Section 39, Sub-section 1, "with respect to waterclosets, earth-closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act," were made by the London County Council and were confirmed by the Local Government Board on June 25th. I pointed out that as some of these Bye-Laws related to matters also dealt with in the Vestry's drainage regulations made under the Metropolis Management Acts, it would be necessary, as it was the duty of the Vestry as the Sanitary Authority, to observe and enforce the Bye-Laws to make the Vestry's regulations agree exactly with them, or confusion would arise and the Vestry ordered that their regulations should be so altered. It will be noticed that although the Public Health Act recites that the London County Council shall make Bye-Laws with respect to water-closets in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, the Bye-Laws are not retrospective but only apply to water-closets constructed after the confirmation of the 38 Bye-Laws, excepting that where any apparatus shall be newly fitted in connection with any existing water-closet the requirements of the Bye-Laws as would be applicable to the apparatus if such water-closet was being newly constructed must be complied with. Smoke Nuisances. The duty of enforcing the abatement of smoke nuisances formerly performed by the police, now by Sections 23 and 24 of the Public Health Act, devolves upon the Sanitary Authority; and in many cases where there was an infringement of the Act letters were written calling the attention of the offenders to the nuisance, which was then abated ; but the complaints of the smoke arising from the Fulham Pottery, in spite of several letters, were so numerous that the Vestry took proceedings against them "for so negligently using the furnace as that the smoke arising therefrom is not effectually consumed or burnt." The summons was dismissed, without costs, the magistrate holding that although the existence of the nuisance was shown, it was for the Vestry to prove that the furnace was so constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising therefrom, otherwise there could be no conviction for negligence. Overcrowding. Sixteen houses were certified as being overcrowded, and notices to abate the overcrowding were served on the persons responsible for it, which were promptly complied with. From the census returns it is evident that there is a good deal of overcrowding in the parish, but it escapes notice, as the staff of inspectors is too limited to undertake a systematic examination even of the very poor property, which is so eminently desirable. Much good could probably be effected if district visitors and others who visit the poor would always inform the Sanitary Department of any case of apparent overcrowding, and of any insanitary condition they meet with. At present it is greatly to be regretted that so few complaints are received from those who necessarily have an intimate knowledge of the conditions under which the majority of the poor live. BAKEHOUSES. There are 75 bakehouses in Fulham which have been regularly inspected during the year. On the whole they have been found in a fairly satisfactory condition; great improvements in respect to the 39 water supply, drainage &c., having been effected during the two previous years. The defects found were mainly of a minor character and were promptly remedied on attention being called to them. It is however to be regretted that all with but five exceptions are underground, and this, too, is the case with those recently opened in new districts. Legislation is urgently needed to enforce the registration and annual licensing of all bakehouses and although it would entail too great a hardship on many bakers to interfere with existing underground bakehouses, provided they are in good sanitary condition as far as an underground bakehouse can be, no newly-erected bakehouse should be permitted to be underground. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. The licenses of the undermentioned slaughter-houses were renewed in October last by the County Council, no objection to the renewal being raised by the Vestry. They are but little used, the parish being mainly supplied by the dead meat trade, and have always been found well kept. Situation. Licensee. 62, Melmoth Place T. H. Belcher. 567, King's Road W. F.

Turvey 5 40 COMMON LODGING HOUSES. Of these there are only three in Fulham. By the Lodging Houses Acts, 14 and 15 Vic., c. 28, and 17 and 18 Vic., c. 41, the control of common lodging houses was entrusted to the Police. These Acts were repealed except so far as relates to the Metropolitan Police District, by the Public Health Act of 1875, and Sanitary Authorities throughout the country have consequently been exercising powers of control over such houses which in London was vested in the Police. In the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, there are no clauses corresponding to Clause 76 to 89 of the Public Health Act, 1875, which deal with common lodging houses, but that the Sanitary Authority have right of entry and consequent power to deal with any insanitary condition of the premises they may find is clear from the following case:— On 30th May last Sanitary-Inspector Grigg applied to be admitted to inspect a common lodging house 541a King's Road. He was refused admission unless he had the police officer with him. He informed the deputy in charge that unless he was admitted freely to perform his duties under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, he should apply to the magistrate at the West London Police Court for a warrant empowering him to enter. Admission was still refused and he accordingly applied to Mr. Curtis Bennett, the sitting magistrate at the West London Police Court for a warrant to enter. The application was opposed by two Inspectors of lodging houses, who contended that under the Common Lodging Houses Acts only the police officers duly appointed by the Chief Commissioner, were entitled to inspect. The Sanitary Inspector explained that he did not apply for admission under the Common Lodging Houses Act but under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which requires that every house in the district should be inspected, and as there was no exemption in respect of Common Lodging Houses. The magistrate upheld this view and in granting the warrant of entry said that the Sanitary Inspector not only had a right to inspect Common Lodging Houses in his district, but it was his duty to do so. On endeavouring to execute the magistrate's warrant, the Sanitary Inspector was again refused admission and the Vestry issued a summons against the deputy for penalties for obstructing their Inspector jn executing the warrant. The case was heard by Mr. Curtis- 41 Bennett, and the defendant's solicitor again raised the point that Common Lodging Houses were under control of the Police and that the Sanitary Authority had no right of entry, but the learned magistrate held that it was the duty of the Sanitary Authority, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to cause every house in their district to be inspected and there was no exemption in respect of common lodging houses. The Sanitary Inspector was perfectly within his right and he fined the defendant £20 and costs, but as the deputy was only acting under his employer's orders in refusing the Sanitary Inspector admission, the penalty would be reduced to £2 and costs if the Inspector was admitted within 24 hours. The magistrate recommended that if the Inspector was further obstructed, the owner who gave the order to the deputy should be included in further proceedings, and he would be punished. The Secretary of State for the Home Department has informed the County Council that it is his intention to transfer to the Council by Provisional Order, the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of common lodging houses. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. The following houses were represented to the Sanitary Authority, under this Act, as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation :— 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, & 56, Rylston Road Closed by owner, since repaired and re-opened. 93, 95, & 97, Peterboro' Road Closed by magistrate's order. 1, Sotheron Road Closed by owner, since paired and re-opened. 1, Queen Anne's Terrace Closed by magistrate's order. 482, Fulham Road Closed by owner. 51, Hammersmith Road Demolished. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Hatfield Street Closed by owner. 6 and 7, Hatfield Street Closed by magistrate's order. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, & 14, Hatfield Street Houses have changed hands since notice was served.

Repaired by owner. 39, 41, and 43, High Street Demolished. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. The following samples were taken during the year for analysis :— North Ward 26 South Ward 20 Walham Ward 17 63 All were samples of milk, and 13, or 20 per cent., were found to be adulterated, and 9 were stated to be of poor quality. In the following table is a record of the proceedings taken and their result:— Thomas Dawson, Milk 10 per cent. Fined £1 and 26, New Crown Terrace added water 12s. 6d. costs Frank Stride, Milk 24 per cent. Fined £2 and 17 Filmer Road added water 12s. 6d. costs William Brown, Milk 44 per cent. Dismissed.

Bertram & Co., Milk 36 per cent. Dismissed. Earl's Court Exhibition added water peal lodged W. Morrish, Ditto Withdrawn. 15, Bellevue Road £2 2s. costs against Vestry W. Brown, Milk 10 per cent. Fined £20 and Farmers' Direct Supply added water, 43 12s. 6d. costs Association per cent, fat stracted J. Holloway, Milk 33 per cent. Fined £1 and 4, Greyhound Road added water 12 s. 6d. costs It will be noticed that William Brown, who trades under the designation of the Farmers' Direct Supply Association, figures three times in the list, and that on two occasions the maximum penalty of £20 was imposed, while on the third the summons was dismissed on a technical point. As this man had been repeatedly convicted in different parts of London of selling adulterated milk, I suggested to the Vestry that as the infliction of fines had no deterrent effect they should proceed against him by indictment, as Clause 28 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act says, " Nothing in this Act contained shall affect the power of proceeding by indictment, or take away any remedy against any offender under this Act." The Solicitor to the Vestry, however, advised that there would be difficulties in the way of proceeding by indictment, so proceedings were taken in the ordinary way. Fewer samples were taken than usual during the year, there being only one sample taken for every 1,662 of the population, while in London during '92 the proportion was 1 to every 573 persons, in fact, the number taken was utterly inadequate to act as an efficient check to adulteration. That more samples were not taken was due to the fact that the time of the Inspectors was fully taken up in dealing with ordinary complaints and cases of notified infectious diseases, which were exceptionally numerous, while the delay in removal made necessary many additional visits. The need of additional Sanitary Inspectors is urgently felt in connection with this matter, and when it is remembered that there are in Fulham 185 registered milkshops, some idea may be formed of the 44 number of samples of various kinds of food that should be taken in order to adequately protect the public. The appointment of a Sanitary Inspector is advisable whose special duties would be to procure samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, to undertake a general supervision, as far as practicable, of the food supply, and the frequent inspection of bake-houses and other places where food is prepared. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL. A Bill to amend the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and the Margarine Act, 1887, was brought before the House of Commons in February last. The main provision of the Bill was to make the act of sale by a wholesale trader to a retailer a warranty that the article sold is of the nature, substance, and quality demanded by the purchaser. Such a provision, if passed into law, would entirely prevent the successful application of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and your Vestry while considering that a thoroughly comprehensive Amendment Act is required both in the interest of the retailer and of the public, considered the proposed bill to be altogether of a most unsatisfactory character and accordingly presented a petition against the Bill. Meteorology. In Table J in the appendix will be found a record of the meteorological conditions in each week of the year, together with the number of deaths from certain diseases. SANITARY WORK. The subjoined table gives a record of the work done during the year by your Sanitary Officials.

Allusion has previously been made to the neglect of certain very necessary work owing to the insufficient number of Sanitary Inspectors, and the Vestry must clearly understand that the present staff is quite inadequate to properly perform the duties devolving upon the Sanitary Authority. If Fulham be compared with the rest of London, this deficiency is most noticeable, as taking the whole of the Metropolis there is one Sanitary Inspector to every 21,000 inhabitants, while in Fulham there is only one to every 35,000; so that two additional Inspectors are needed to merely bring us up to the average level of other districts, and no Sanitary Authority has been accused of undue extravagance in respect of the sanitary staff. Then it must be borne in mind that there has been no increase in the number of Sanitary Inspectors since January, 1891, and since then not only has the population of Fulham increased by some 18,000, but the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, have come into operation, both of which impose many additional duties on the Sanitary Authority. The attention of your Vestry has been respeatedly drawn to the necessity for increasing the number of 49 Inspectors, and although a Sub-Committee appointed to consider the question recommended that an additional Sanitary Inspector should be appointed, together with an Assistant Clerk in the Sanitary Department, as much of the time of the Inspectors is at present taken up by clerical work, the Vestry declined to act on the recommendation. No excuse on the ground of enforced economy can be alleged, since if the Inspectors were reappointed under the Local Government Board the half of their salaries could be obtained from the London County Council, so that should the Vestry persist in their refusal to employ an adequate staff the inference will be unavoidable that they are unwilling that the Acts—for the faithful administration of which, in the interests of the public health, they, as the Sanitary Authority, are responsible— should be properly carried out. I have given a resume of the work done in the Sanitary Department during the year, but cannot conclude without recording my opinion that the thanks of the Vestry are due to the Sanitary Inspectors and the Sanitary Clerk for the zeal and discretion with which they have carried out the important duties devolving on them. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. CHARLES JACKSON. Feb., 1894 Medical Officer of Health. ERRATA.

The occupier of any premises fronting, adjoining, or abutting on any street not repairable by the inhabitants at large shall, as soon as conveniently may be after the cessation of any fall of snow, remove or cause to be removed from the footways and pavements adjoining such premises and forming part of such street all snow fallen or accumulated on such footways and pavements in such a manner and with such precautions as will prevent any undue accumulation in any channel or carriageway or upon any paved crossing. The person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of the premises, or if there is no such person, then any person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of any part of the premises, and in the case of any premises the whole of which is let in tenements or to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the tenants or lodgers, either on his own account or as the agent of another person, shall for the purposes of this bye-law be deemed to be the occupier. I 3. Every person who shall remove any snow from any premises on to any carriageway shall deposit the same in such a manner and with such precautions as to prevent any accumulation thereof in any channel or upon any paved crossing. If in the process of such removal any snow be deposited upon any footway or pavement in any street, he shall forthwith remove such snow from such footway or pavement. 4. Every person who shall throw any salt upon any snow on the footway of any street shall do so in such quantity and in such manner as effectually to dissolve the whole of such snow, and he shall forthwith effectually remove from the footway the whole of the deposit resulting from the mixture of the salt with the snow.

The occupier of a manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or of any premises comprising a dunghill, shall not cause or suffer any offensive matter to run out of such manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence, so as to be likely to become a nuisance. For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner, as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. 8. The occupier of any premises shall not keep nor allow to be keep any animal on such premises in such a place or in such a manner as to pollute, or to be likely to pollute, any water supplied for use or used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, or any water used or likely to be used in any dairy. 9. Every occupier of a building or premises wherein or whereon any horse or other beast of draught or burden, or any cattle may be kept, shall deposit or cause to be deposited in a suitable receptable all dung, manure, soil, filth, or other offensive or noxious matter other than urine and other liquid filth which may, from time to time, be produced in the keeping of any such animal in such building or upon such premises. He shall likewise provide in connection with such building or premises a sufficient drain, constructed in such a manner, and of such materials, and maintained at all times in such a condition, as effectually to carry away all urine and liquid filth or refuse therefrom.
