ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 194. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 2,. Shalston Villas, Surbiton. November, 1944. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in submitting my 22nd Annual Report which concerns the health of Surbiton during the year 1943. In spite of the war, the health of the district compares favourably with previous years. An important feature is the.increasing.numoerof Pulmonary Tuberculosis cases which is attributed to the fact that there is an acute shortage of houses, which in turn leads to overcrowding and a lower standard of living. It is imperative that the Council Should proceed with the erection of houses to prevent a further deterioration of the health of the people, particularly in the case of Tuberculosis. The deaths of infants below 1 year still show an improvement on past years in spite of the four years of war.

Immunisation and Schick Testing was started in 1935 and from that date the decline has continued. A slight increase is shown in 1941-1942 probably due to falling off in immunisation, removal due to war conditions and bombing etc. Scarlet Fever shows a remarkable increase, but fortunately the disease is not so severe as was the case in earlier years. The increase is not readily explained, but overcrowding and the fact that all cases are not sent to hospital may account for this rise. There have been a few return cases. -8- TOTAL CASES NOTIFIED.

War conditions, want of proper and efficient nourishment, bad living conditions (overcrowding ooth in homes and in shelters) are, no doubt,"a contributory cause. The building of houses,in my opinion, should be greatly accelerated. -10 - of the 96 now cases tabulated ov rleaf 22 eases are transferred-from oth-r districts. The table shows an increase compared with la3t year of 35 pulmonary cases of tuberculosis, and the nOn-pulmonary cases show .an increase of 9. The deaths, show a decrease of 1. . • At the. commencement of the year there were 318 cases of tuberculosis on the register and at the end of the year this figure had increased to 362. During, the year 1 case was notified as recovered -from the disease, 24 patients left the district, and there were 27 deaths, of the 96 new cases it is interesting to note that 73 of these were cases first notified in the district.

RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. has hitherto been administered in this Borough by the Surrey County Council. In 1942 Ministerial responsibility under that Act in Urban areas was transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Ministry of Food. In May 1943' the minifeter of Food, under powers conferred on him by the Defence Regulations, ftiadfe the infestation Order, 1943. This Order, amongst other things gave power to the Minister of Food to give "directions" to"local'atithbritiek to perform the fallowing functions:- (a) To make a comprehensive report to the Minister with regard to infestations by rats and mice and the measures taken or proposed to deal therewith. (b) The remedying of such infestations, and (c) The enforcement of any "direction" in relation to infestations given by 'the" Minister to any occupier or other responsible' per'son. A conference of' reper'e's'ehtative's' 'of authorities in the London Area was called by the Ministry of Food, and subsequently a Committee comprising fifteen members appointed by those authorities was formed to assist the Ministry in administering a scheme of rodent control, The first "direction" issued was for the making of a survey in each local authority area to locate the large colonies of rats ("reservoir" and-•"■ma jor-"' -infestations) . This survey was to be made by each local a-u-thority whether or not it possessed statutory powers under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. The survey was duly carried out in this Borough with the co-operation of the Surrey County Council's Superviser of Rat Destruction, and revealed one "reservoir" and two "major" infestrtions. These infestations were subsequently dealt with by the County'Council under contract with the occupie. Ministry ers of the premises concerned. To facilitate .this survey thof Food embarked upon a publicity campaign, urging the public to report the presence of rats. This brought a considerable number of complaints to the Department and, on the whole, the information was valuable. Unfortunately there was -22- some misconception of the duties of the Corporation, many people getting the impression that they were to he relieved of responsibility in the matter rnd thrt the Corporation would forthwith proceed to disinfest their premises free of charge. The position was rather confused, because, although the Corporation hrd received a "direction" from the Ministry of Pood under the Infestation Order, the County Council was still administering the 1919 Act. The Ministry therefore arranged for the County Council to delegate its powers under that Act to the Corporation, and urged the Corporation to accept such delegation. After some negotiation the Corporation accepted such powers in May 1944. On the 31st August, 1944, the Corporation was "directed" by the Minister of Pood to "take such action as may be necessary to remedy infestation of lrnd within your administrative area." Prom the foregoing it will be seen that the only duty of the Corporation in connection with rat destruction during 1943 (the year under review in this Report) wps that of making the Survey, all operational duties being performed by the Surrey County Council. CONCLUSION. Examination of the staff shown on the first page explains the manpower difficulty the Department was in until the close of the yerr, and is the explanation of the decreased total number of visits made during the year. In spite of this shortage, and the fact that I was away ill for a considerable period, the actual works of sanitary improvements effected compare very favourably with other years; this observation applying equally to the work done on Council Houses. An energetic drive was made on the industrial area to ensure adequate means of escape in case of fire in factories; sampling under the Pood and Drugs Act was considerably increased and in general food inspection work there was a very heavy increase in the amount of food dec It with, which, as the report shows, was of great variety. No detail is given in this report of the multifarious duties carried out consequent upon enemy action, nor to the volume of day and night work put in by the staff find voluntary helpers in connection v;ith evacuation, rehousing, billeting and generc 1 care of the homeless. I can confidently say that no essential public health matter hrs been neglected, rnd this is due to the efficient, loyal service rendered by members of my staff, and the co-operation of colleagues in all departments. I particularly commend my,Deputy Mr. Eldridge, for the able way in which the functions of the Department were maintained during my absence, and his valuable help throughout the whole of the year. I am, ladies and gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEOFFREY McCICELAND, Chief Sanitary Inspector. -23-
