VESTRY OF THE Parish of Saint Leonard,Shoreditch. MIDDLESEX. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT, 1855. TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT for the YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1880. PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18 & 19 VIC., CAP. 120. LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co., Steam Printers, 5, Hackney Road. 1881 A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saiut Leonard, Shore ditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ending Lady-day, 1880. Published pursuant to the " Metropolis Local Management Acts." REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1880, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £51,566 6s. 4d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. 1d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 5d.; to Michaelmas, 7d. ; to Christmas, 6d.; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 6d. The amount of: the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Lady-day, 1879, was £50,000; and for the last year, £39,000; and for the half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1880, is £24,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1879, was nil; at the end of the year, ending at Lady-day, 1880, the sum of £4,500 was due. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rate will be found in the Balance Sheet, as audited and signed. 6 SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last three years were— 1878. 1879. 1880. General, in the £ 1/9 2/- 2/1 Sewers ditto 6d. 6d. 7d. 2/3 2/6 2/8 The total amount collected on the Vestry rates for the year was £65,418 4s. 10d., an increase from the previous year of £4,848 15s. 0d. Of these sums collected by the Vestry large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £39,000 paid to the Guardians, out which the County Rates and Metropolitan Asylum Board's charges are paid, there is the sum of £10,641 15s. 9d. paid to the Commissioners of Police, equal to an actual rate on the parish of 5d. in the £; also £210 9s. 9d. to the Returning Officer for Borough Registration expenses. From the Sewers rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated rate of £11,114 13s. 6d. From the General rate is paid the School Board rate of £11,538 6s. 2d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses or for the allowance to owners. It will therefore be seen that where, from local circumstances, a considerable portion of property is unoccupied the burden of taxation falls unequally upon the remaining portion, but possibly a remedy for this inequality is not to be easily devised. 7 ASSESSMENTS. The Valuation List for the previous year amounted to £641,204 Gross value, £517,897 Rateable value. For the present year the amount is fixed at Gross value, £650,990; Rateable value, £526,035 ; being an increase of £9,786 and £8,138 respectively. RAILWAYS, TRAMWAYS, &c.. The only proposal relating to works of this character made to Parliament in the Session commencing 1880, affecting this parish, was one which projected a line of tramway from Shoreditch High Street, through Bethnal Green Road, and thence eastwards. So far as the parish of Shoreditch was concerned, it was a matter of the extension of the tramway from the High Street through the New Bethnal Green Road for about a distance of 200 yards. The Company agreed with the Vestry in respect to this proposed extension, to the same terms as had been previously settled for the Shoreditch High Street. It now transpires that owing to difficulties which have arisen as to terms in other parishes, the Company has abandoned all projects for new works during the present Session. HARWAR STREET IMPROVEMENT. In the report of the last year the following was stated:— " The arrangements between the Vestry, the Drapers' Company, and the Charity Commissioners, for the removal of Harwar's Almshouses, in Kingsland Road, and the completing the thoroughfare through Harwar Street, late Thomas Street, have progressed somewhat slowly owing to some differences between the Company and the Commissioners. These have now been settled and the order will shortly be issued. " The scheme to be sanctioned "will be the conversion of the benefits of the Almshouses into twelve pensions,—six men, married or single, and six women, single or widows, of £30 per year each. 8 The present inmates will receive £35 15s. per year. One half of the pensions will be appointed on the recommendation of the Charity Trustees of this parish, the other half will be appointed by the Drapers' Company. So much of the present site as is not required for improvement purposes will be let by the Company on building lease, and the rent obtainable will be applied to the Pension Fund. To make up the Pension Fund to £240 per year, the Vestry is to pay into Consols such a sum as will afford dividends which, when added to the rent obtainable, will provide that sum of £240; but at first the sum of £3,000 is to be invested to await the final adjustment after the property has been let. It is estimated that the total cost of widening and paving the widened portions of the thoroughfares will be £3,000, but that will depend upon the amount of rent that will be obtained. The Metropolitan Board has agreed to contribute one-half, such contribution not to exceed £2,000." I have now only to report that the order has been issued by the Charity Commissioners, and is dated the 12th of August, 1879, confirming the scheme as stated in outline above, and that a copy of the same may be seen at the Vestry Offices. By the terms of the agreement between the Vestry and the Charity Trustees, as approved by the Charity Commissioners, the sum of £240 was to be secured to the Charity, firstly by the ground rent of the property to be let, and secondly the balance by dividends acoruing from a sum to be invested in Consols by the Vestry; but in no case was the Vestry to pay a less sum as purchase-money for the land taken from the Company than £450. The property was put up for letting by the Drapers' Company, and the highest bid (apparently a genuine one, as one year's rent was deposited) was £230, leaving but £10 per year to be made up by the Vestry. Under these circumstances the proviso for payment of £450 conies into operation. The Vestry has paid to the account of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds the sum of £2,932 10s. 0d., representing £3,000 in Consols; and should the arrangement be, as is expected, fully 9 carried out upon the terms as above stated, there will have to be returned to the Vestry a sum representing in Consols at the time of the transfers £2,550. The Vestry has also paid to the Drapers' Company towards the allowance to pensioners (late inmates of Harwar's Almshouses), as per agreement, £150, for one year, Michaelmas, 1879, to Michaelmas, 1880. There will be a further sum to pay, perhaps £30, to Christmas next; but the exact amount will depend upon matters not yet quite determined. The Metropolitan Board has agreed to contribute one-half the net cost of this improvement, such contribution not to exceed the sum of £2,000. This matter as to total cost and contribution is not finally settled. LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. During the last year the Vestry has effected two improvements of a somewhat small, still of an important, character. First, the removal of the forecourt of No. 7, Curtain Road, at a total cost, including compensation to owners, professioual charges, paving, &c., of £222 15s. 4d.; and second, the rounding of the corner of the Chapel yard at the junction of Mintern Street and New North Road—total cost, £182 15s. 5d.; towards which the Tramway Company, whose lines pass the corner, paid £50. It is expected that the Metropolitan Board will contribute one-half of the cost of both these improvements. DRINKING FOUNTAIN AND COLUMN, GREAT EASTERN STREET AND OLD STREET. In the last Annual Report reference was made to a subject which was then under the consideration of the Improvement Committee—the erection of a Drinking Fountain and Column, at the junction of Great Eastern Street and Old Street. Since then the Committee submitted to the Vestry a proposal which has been adopted. It has been decided to erect a pedestal and column, to be of polished grey and red Scotch granite, with bronze capital and 10 other ornaments. The granite work has been entrusted to Mr. A. Nicholson, of Mark Lane; the bronze work to the Coalbrooke Dale Company, through the agency of Mr. E. Wells, of Wood Street; the foundations have been entrusted to Messrs. Nowell & Robson. The arrangements for fixing are not yet determined; the water supply and apparatus connected therewith will be provided by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association. It is expected that the column will be erected in September next. The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association has already provided a granite horse trough, near the spot, which is extensively used. RAILWAYS, TRAMWAYS, &c. No Railway or other Bills of a like character, affecting the Parish, have been promoted during the past year, except a Bill to authorise inter alia the extension of the North Metropolitan Tramway, from the High Street, Shoreditch, through the Bethnal Green Road, to a junction with the existing line in Cambridge Road. A very small portion of this line would have affected this parish, and no difficulty was experienced by the Vestry in coming to an agreement with the Tramway Company. Owing, however, to difficulties which arose between other parishes and districts, and the Company, the latter was induced to abandon all extensions which were struck out of the Bill, and the same is now being promoted for the Company's private purposes only, and has no relation to public works. SALE OF FOOD ANDJRUGS ACT Appended are the Reports of Dr. Stevenson, Analyst. Prosecutions were instituted and convictions obtained in several cases, the penalties varying from £5 to the costs of the summons. The Act has practically put an end to food adulteration. Milk and butter are now almost the only articles in respect to which it is practised. 11 THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 154 times; the Council Chamber 13 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting were £1,037 19s. Od. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended April 30th, 1880, is as follows:— Number of Vestry Meetings 36 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 35 Sewers, &c., Committee 42 Lighting Committee 6 Sanitary Committee (including Meetings of Sub-Committee) 12 Valuation Committee 20 Town Hall Committee 32 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 13 Appended is a list of Contracts entered into by the Vestry for the year, with other requisite information.

The following quantities of old stone in the Vestry Stoneyards were dressed during the year at a cost of £222 13s, 9d., viz:— 28 yards super York edging 1845 „ „ Granites 310 feet run Channel stones 2136 „ „ Curb SEWERS WORK. The following new works were executed during the year at a cost of £104 5s. 7d.:— Norris Street and Hutley Place—292 feet 12-in. pipe 77 5 2 Hare Walk, by Preedy's Buildings—150 feet 12-inch pipe 23 5 7 Kingsland Road, by Dunston Street—Gulley reconstructed 3 14 10 40 Four flushers and several laborers have been employed in the cleansing and repairing the sowers and gullies in the Parish, and their wages for the year amounted to the large sum of £432 18s. 6d. I am sorry to have to say that the condition of the sewers is not so satisfactory as I could wish, as since the constant water supply came into operation in this parish the amount of water that is allowed to pass through the drains into the sewers is so little that some of the smaller and pipe sewers get stopped up in consequence, as the large amount spent in labor, in opening on to and cleansing will show, being nearly double that of last year. One man has been constantly employed in cleansing the urinals in the parish, and on Sundays and holidays two men are employed in the early morning for the same purpose; the amount paid in wages for the year, for this purpose, was £6 1 4s. 4d. The sum of £22 18s. 8d. was expended in wages for labor in removing and setting up Lamp Columns under the direction of the Lamp Inspector. The sum of £42 12s. 9d. was paid the Inspector for supervision of the water carts during the watering season. As regards the general condition of the parish, I may state that as a very large amount of money has been expended in carriageway paving during the year, the paved carriageways are in very fair order, with the following exceptions:— Sun Street (since ordered to be done) Clifton Street Holywell Lane Pitfield Street and Bevenden Street. The unpaved roadways, in consequence of the use of the steam roller, are getting in a very good state, and I think and hope 41 that I shall be able in my next report to say that the whole of the McAdam and ballast roads in the parish are in good order. The footway paving, excepting a few instances, is in good order. Reports and estimates for new work will be laid before the Vestry in due course. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE CHARLES PERRETT, Surveyor. Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1880. VESTRY O??? DEATHS REGISTERED FROM ALL CAUSES D??? YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1880. AGES.

To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, 5,125 births—2,501 males and 2,624 females—and 3,138 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1880. Deducting the deaths (242) which occurred in Holborn Infirmary, the mortality was 22.71 per 1,000 living, above the average of the last five years, which was 22.50 per 1,000. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerstone West District, in which is situated Shoreditch Infirmary. Population. Deaths. Average per 1000. Hoxton New Town 27,835 559 20.30 Hoxton Old Town 26,933 560 20.50 Haggerstone West 24,162 826 33.30 Haggerstone East 19,259 445 23.10 St. Leonard 16,545 333 20.30 Holywell 12,430 172 13.60 44 608 deaths occurred in public institutions of the parish; 317 in Shoreditch Infirmary; 242 in Holborn Infirmary, situate in Hoxton New Town; 37 in the North Eastern Hospital; and 12 in Hoxton House. Diseases acknowledged to be caused by cold and damp were very destructive. There were 545 deaths from bronchitis, 300 from phthisis, and 239 from pneumonia. All lung affections are much influenced by cold and wet. The number of deaths registered under one year has slightly diminished, there being 919, against 963 the year before; and under live years of age, 1,432, against 1,481 in the previous year. 535 deaths occurred in persons at and over 65 years of age; 192 persons died from 75 to 85; 46 from 85 to 95; and 6 deaths were registered at 95 and upwards;—whilst in the previous year, the weather then also being severe—very cold, 576 died at 65 to 75; 184 from 75 to 85; 53 from 85 to 95; and 6 from 95 and upwards. In infancy, the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease (289), comprising 125 from bronchitis, 74 from pneumonia, and 90 from other pulmonary affections. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were—atrophy and debility, 100 deaths; convulsions, 94; whooping cough, 76; premature birth, 58; and diarrhoea, 50. In old age, 130 deaths were caused by bronchitis, 36 by heart disease, and 35 by paralysis; but the largest number, 235, was registered under the term of "old age." During the winter and spring months (December, January, February and March) of the year ending 25th March, 1880, there were 1,275 deaths registered, whilst in the corresponding months of the previous year there were 1,168 deaths. ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 508 deaths—153 by whooping cough, 78 by diarrhoea, 57 by scarlet fever, 132 by measles, 45 13 by diptheria, and 69 by other zymotic diseases. 76 of the 153 deaths from whooping cough occurred to infants under one year of age ; 50 of the 78 deaths from diarrhoea occurred under one year. The influence of age is much more manifest; —128 of the 153 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years; and 61 of the 78 deaths from diarrhoea occurred under two years of age. There were 6 deaths from small-pox, and the reports made to the Sanitary Department show that the disease lingers in the parish, but the cases are mostly of a very mild kind. IMPROVEMENT OF DWELLINGS.—It is an old saying, and physiological observation at the present day confirms it, that human beings are as the surroundings affect them. The matter and forces reflected from the structures standing by evidently alter and color living beings accordingly, like producing like. If the materials are enduring, stability results; if decomposing and unreliable, the transmitted influence and effect is similar. Therefore the welfare of cities must largely depend on the dwellings of the inhabitants. The Sanitary Authority in the past year have directed much attention to the dwellings, and labored to make them more helpful; and after inspecting much of the work done, I have to report that the character of the improvements is much more calculated to protect the health of the inhabitants. Inspector Alexander's report enumerates the improvements; it shews that the purpose has been to secure greater cleanliness, more light and air, more protection from cold and damp, and from other injurious agents. The walls and ceilings of 419 dwellings have been cleansed, repaired and whitewashed. Yards and areas were cleansed and limewhited in 180 dwellings. Dust bins provided in 233 premises. Water 40 closets cleansed and repaired in 605. Water laid on to closets or restored in 617. Water for drinking and other domestic purposes supplied direct from the main (without cisterns or butts) in 526. In 249 premises, old leaky brick drains were removed and glazed pipes properly constructed were substituted. 295 drains were re-trapped. 28 cesspools emptied and ground saturated with sewage removed, and replaced with lime rubbish and earth. Stack pipes communicating with drains, and their heads dangerously close to bed room windows, leading sewer gases into the houses, were removed from 21.3 dwellings. 140 waste pipes of sinks were properly trapped or ended in the open air; the direct communication with the sewer having conveyed sewer gases into the dwellings. Ventilators were provided under the floors of 65 dwellings. Eaves gutters provided to prevent water from the roof saturating the walls in 69 premises. Roofs repaired in 90. Leaking water pipes, causing dampness, repaired in 10. The yards of 496 dwellings were paved with impervious material; cement, concrete, or York stone, to keep the surface soil dry, and allow air to circulate freely through it, so to oxidize and otherwise render harmless poisonous gases collected in the ground. Pavement repaired and rendered impervious in 111 yards; and areas paved and rendered impervious in 25. Sculleries paved in 78. Areas constructed to remove dampness in 6 premises; 88 stairs and 125 floors were repaired to prevent persons being thrown down and injured. 20 dwellings unfit for human habitation were ordered to be closed, owing to their dirty dilapidated condition. In many small premises, having small yards, the accumulation of dust and other decomposing matter spreads much dirt through the dwellings; to prevent this the Sanitary Officer has during the last few years induced many owners to remove the dust bins from the yards of the houses and provide public dust bins in much more 47 airy places. This has been done in 195 premises; and another advantage is the newly erected dust bins are much more serviceable because much better constructed. Day by day inspections to ascertain the dangerous conditions, to secure their removal, and to ensure the work being well done, required much care and energy. This is evidenced from the fact that 5311 separate nuisances, dangerous to health, were removed during the year. WATER SUPPLY.—The constant supply from the New River Company has worked well. The inhabitants draw the water direct from the main in a large number of premises, but in a number of others cisterns are retained, and whilst the practice may be excused it exposes the water to dirt in the air, and in the cisterns, &c. Cisterns are retained from the apprehension that the Water Company may fail to continue the constant supply; and the supply has been discontinued for a few hours on more than one occasion during the year, but the inhabitants have stated that the inconvenience therefrom has been small, and little complaint of it has been made to the Sanitary Department. Water butts doubtless are retained in some of the smaller dwellings, but the Sanitary Authorities have lost no opportunity of inducing or compelling the owners to remove them and supply the premises with water for drinking purposes direct from the main. The East London Water Company's district in Shoreditch, has also the Constant Service, and on the whole has worked well. The inhabitants from a part of the district (High street, Shoreditch) attended before the Vestry and Sanitary Committee and complained that the second and higher stories of their houses were unsupplied with water, and they were inconsequence put to great inconvenience. The Medical Officer reported to the Vestry, as follows—"That from the representation recently 48 made to the Sanitary Committee of the parish, it was evident that many of the inhabitants were suffering, not only inconvenience but probably injury to their health in consequence of not having sufficient water supplied to their dwellings by the "East London Water Company." And in order that there might be no doubt of the facts, I instructed Inspector Alexander to visit a number of the dwellings and ascertain the condition of their water supply. He has inspected 122 premises and found that in most of the dwellings the inhabitants could obtain sufficient water for ordinary purposes, so long as they required a comparatively small quantity, but if they required a large continued supply they could not obtain it. In nine premises the supply was totally inadequate, the water did not reach the upper part of the houses, and in some it did not extend sufficiently to the first floors. These premises contained 427 persons, and the closets used by them had no water supply or only an intermittent supply. It is evident that the health of the inhabitants of these promises is prejudically affected by the neglect of the "Water Company;" and I venture to urge the Vestry to represent the facts to the Government Authorities, requesting them to take measures to bring the Company to supply the premises properly with water according to their undertaking." Representations were made to the Local Government Board and to the Company with a view to obtain an increased pressure. This was attended with benefit to the consumers at that time, but it has been found to be a benefit of an intermittent character. The pressure failing often to force the water to the prescribed level, and occasioning in consequence great inconvenience. 49 DISINFECTION.—Inspector Fletcher shews in his report appended that 215 houses in which small pox, scarlet and other fevers had occurred, were disinfected, by fumigating the infected rooms with sulphur, and by exposing the rooms, keeping the windows open much to the open air, therewith diluting and destroying the poison, and by cleansing the walls, floors and ceilings with carbolic acid and water. The Disinfecting Oven has worked well, 123 infected beds, 158 pillows, 112 bolsters, 87 mattrasses, and 713 other articles were disinfected at the Disinfecting Oven. Much of the Inspector's time has been occupied in securing the isolation of infected persons; for this purpose 41 of the 50 persons suffering from small pox were removed to the small pox hospital. TRADE NUISANCES.—Several minor complaints have been made to the Sanitary Department, of trades such as Skin Dryers, of dust and offensive effluvia escaping into the surrounding premises. Gas Works, Great Cambridge Street. Noxious gases escape from the purifiers. This nuisance has been much lessened during the past year, but occasional nuisances are caused in the course of cleansing the purifiers. COW HOUSES and SLAUGHTER HOUSES are now supervised by the Inspectors of the Metropolitan Board, but should nuisances dangerous to health occur in these premises the Vestry could, under the Nuisance Removal Act, at any time take action. REMOVAL OF DUST.—Inspector Fletcher reports that it has been in the last year better attended to, about 18,000 loads were removed from the parish ; but it is needless to say that 50 much more energy and attention on the part of all concerned is needed to prevent large accumulations of dust. WATERING THE STREETS.—The Inspector reports that this has been more effectually done since the Vestry had the watering arrangement more directly under its own control. 1 am. Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON. 51 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department, To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ending 25th March, 1880, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. A special report was made with reference to complaints of insufficient water supply to houses in High Street, showing the state of supply in 122 premises House to house visitation, and special inspections with reference to complaints made in 1028 premises Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 972 premises 52 WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES. Glazed pipe drains provided in lieu of dilapidated brick drains in 249 premises Defectively constructed pipe drains repaired or relaid in 289 „ Drains provided where there were none before in 19 „ Drains (untrapped), traps provided in 295 „ Cesspools emptied and filled up in 28 „ Stack pipes (having their heads dangerously close to bedroom windows, permitting sewer gas to pass into the dwellings) disconnected from drains in 243 ,, Stack pipes provided in 45 „ Eaves gutters provided in 69 „ Waste pipes, of sinks within doors (untrapped and permitting sewer gas to impregnate thedwellings) have been securely trapped, or otherwise disconnected from drains, and have now their ends in the open air, and immediately over the yard sinks in 140 „ Roofs repaired in 90 „ Flooring repaired in 125 „ Stairs repaired in 88 „ Walls and ceilings cleansed, whitened and repaired throughout in 220 „ Ditto ditto in part in 199 „ Sashes provided to improve light and ventilation in 10 „ Window Cills provided in 10 „ Ventilation provided under ground floor in 65 „ Water closets (foul and dilapidated) cleansed and repaired in 605 „ Water restored or newly laid on to water closets in 617 „ Obstructions in water closets removed in 59 „ Waters closets in close dark situations removed into light and air in 12 „ 53 Water closets in close dark places lighted and ventilated in 7 premises Water closets, in close dark places, abolished ...in 1 „ Water supplied direct from the main in lieu of cisterns in 359 „ Water supplied direct from the main in lieu of butts in 167 „ Leaking water pipes, causing dampness, repaired in 10 „ Water laid on or restored in 25 „ Yards and areas limewhited in 180 ,, Dust bins provided in 233 „ „ repaired in 58 „ Yards paved imperviously with stone or cement concrete in 496 „ Yard paving repaired, and rendered impervious in 111 „ Areas paved imperviously with stone or cement concrete in 25 „ Sculleries ditto ditto in 78 , Dry areas, constructed to obviate dampness in 6 Premises unfit for habitation, closed 20 MISCELLANEOUS. Overcrowding abated in 2 premises Public urinal constructed in passage of the "Jolly Butchers'" Tavern, Old Street Public urinal attached to the "Marquis of Landsdowne" Tavern, Maria Street, reconstructed 42 Horses and donkeys (improperly stabled), removed from 6 Accumulations of dung and rubbish, removed from 18 Making a total of 5,311 separate nuisances, dangerous to health abated. To ensure the work done being as far as possible of a durable character, many re-inspections had to be made, and 285 letters were written, which took up much time, resulting, however, in the 54 owners having their work generally well done. A few instances are again mentioned in detail, to show the manner of procedure, and the nature of the work accomplished. GLADSTONE BUILDINGS, WILLOW STREET.—In these model dwellings there are 168 suites of apartments, each suite having a separate water supply, and closet accommodation, situate in the scullery. None of the closets were properly supplied with water, so as to flush the pans effectually. The cisterns in which drinking water was stored were all uncovered, placed over the closets close to the ceilings, and immediately under the closet of the apartments above. Several of the tenants complained that their drinking water was polluted with foul liquids dripping from the ceilings, by reason of defective closet arrangements, and many of the ceilings bore evidence as to the fact. Notices were served on the owners requiring the abatement of these nuisances, in compliance with which the whole of the cisterns have been removed. Water is now supplied from tanks placed on the roofs, and the closets are now efficiently flushed by waste preventor cisterns distinct from the household supply in each case. PREEDY'S BUILDINGS, HARE WALK, 9 houses.—These houses were generally dirty and dilapidated. Water for drinking purposes was stored in small and foul butts. The closets and back yards were in the foulest condition. The drains, formed partly of pipes and partly of brickwork, were only a few inches below the surface of the yards. They were periodically blocked, causing thereby great nuisances. It was represented to the Vestry that these houses could not be properly drained, except by the provision of a new sewer in Hare Walk. The Vestry thereupon directed a 12" pipe sewer to be so provided, which has been done. The owner has drained the houses in connection therewith in 55 a proper manner. The yards have been paved with cement concrete. The water closets have been cleansed and repaired, cement floors provided, and water laid on. The sculleries have likewise been paved with cement. The water butts removed, a constant supply of water given to the inhabitants by a "draw-off" direct from the main, and the interiors cleansed and repaired. MARK'S PLAGE, HAGGERSTONE, 12 houses.—These houses were generally in an extreme state of dilapidation. Notices were therefore served, resulting in the transfer of the property under covenants, by which the houses have been very largely renovated, and fitted with improved sanitary appliances. WARE STREET, 6 houses.—These houses were defectively drained. The yards were unpaved. There were no dust bins. The water closets were foul and dilapidated, and without water supply; and water for drinking purposes was stored in foul uncovered cisterns placed on the roofs of the closets. The owner being called upon to abate these nuisances, did after much delay begin the work, but carried it on in such a slow and desultory manner as to largely aggravate the original nuisance. This being reported to the Vestry an order was made by resolution to enter the premises under the power given by the " Metropolis Local Management Acts," and do all necessary works, charging the owner with all costs thereon. The works have been successfully carried out by the Vestry's builder; drains laid, yards paved, water closets repaired and cleansed, and water laid on, dust bins built, and water for drinking purposes laid on direct from the main. No. 5, CUSTANCE STREET.—This house having been found to be largely impregnated with sewer gas, and infested with rats, 56 an order was made upon the owner, requiring the ground under the floor to be opened up, which resulted in the discovery of a large, old, and partially disused sewer at a depth of about 18 below the floor. In this sewer there was a deposit of semi-solid sewage 1-ft. 10-in. deep. This sewer extended from the back of the houses on the other side of Custance Street, and in the opposite direction, behind the houses in Plumber's Place, to its junction with the sewer in Provost Street. Its condition throughout was most defective and caused a large number of premises to be largely infested with rats. This being reported to the Vestry, a Special Committee, with power to act was appointed, under whose direction the whole of the sewage deposit was removed, the sewer broken up, and filled with lime rubbish, and new drains provided by the owners of the houses which had drained into the old sewer. The house, No. 5, had a bed of concrete spread over its entire area, and a ventilated space provided under the floor. It was also thoroughly cleansed and repaired throughout, water closet cleansed and repaired, water laid on; and water for drinking purposes provided direct from the main. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HABITATION.—The two roomed houses, Nos. 1 to 10, Norman's Buildings, Haggerstone, are old, damp, and very dilapidated premises. They were closed in accordance with the Vestry's order. The six-roomed houses, Nos. 5, 7 & 9, Hewett Street, were found in the following state:—The drains (admitted to be defective) blocked and flooding the yards with sewage; the water closets overflowing, and the brickwork dangerously dilapidated. The yards were not paved, there were no dust bins, the roofs leaked badly, the walls, ceilings, floors, stairs, and all internal fittings were very dilapidated. They were closed in accordance with the Vestry's order The four-roomed houses, Nos. 1 to 6, Hoxton Market, may be described in the same terms as the houses in Hewett 57 Street. They also were closed in compliance with the Vestry's order. The eight-roomed houses, Nos. 8 & 9, Hoxton Market, were also in a dirty and dilapidated state. The Owner being required to render the dwellings fit for habitation, decided to close them (which has been done) with a view to re-construction. ST. MARY'S LODGE, HAGGERSTON CHURCH.—Several eases of fever having occurred in these premises, and there being reason to believe the ground under and around the premises to be charged with human remains, notice was therefore served requiring the premises to be closed, and kept closed, until satisfactory evidence was given that they might be inhabited without danger to health. In accordance with the Vestry's order the premises were closed, and remain closed at this time. No Police Court Summonses, for the abatement of Nuisances, have been taken out during the year. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. ALEXANDER, Sanitary Inspector. 59 INSPECTOR FLETCHER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report to you, that during the year ending March 25th, 1880, the conditions named below have caused nuisances dangerous to health, and were inspected and remedied under my supervision. Accumulations of dung, &c., removed from 25 premises Obstructed closet drains, repaired and cleansed in 5 „ Water closets cleansed and repaired in 2 „ Water laid on, or reinstated in 53 „ Overcrowding abated in 7 „ 60 Dirty rooms cleansed in 4 premises Smoke nuisances abated in 2 „ Pigs removed from 1 „ Corpses, decomposing, removed „ 9 „ Minor nuisances (not referred to Inspector Alexander) little alteration needed in 3 „ NUISANCES DANGEROUS TO HEALTH CONSEQUENT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES.—The following details shew the sanitary measures adopted where cases of contagious disease occurred. No. of houses inspected and disinfected 215 Notices served requiring occupiers to disinfect articles liable to retain infection in 215 premises 50 cases of small pox were reported to the sanitary authorities. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease, by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses, drains, &c. 41 of the above cases were removed to the Small Pox Hospital, 9 were not removed. No. of infected beds disinfected at the Vestry's disinfecting oven 123 „ pillows ditto ditto 158 „ mattrasses ditto ditto 87 „ bolsters ditto ditto 112 „ other articles ditto ditto 713 Making a total of 1,203 articles disinfected. COW and SLAUGHTER HOUSES are now under the supervision of the Metropolitan Board's Inspector. 61 ARTICLES OF FOOD, &c., condenmed and destroyed by me as being unfit for human consumption:— 4 barrels of Potatoes 1 box of Apples 2½ bushels of Apples 25 Rabbits 168-lbs. of Veal. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT—See Analyst's Reports. REMOVAL OF DUST.—During the year ending 25th March, 1880, the dust on the whole has been fairly removed from the parish; and there has been about the same number of applications for the removal of dust from private dwellings as last year. The number of applications during the past year, compared with the number of applications during the previous three years, is shewn below:— Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1879-80 1163 9 0 1105 4 0 In the three previous years the average number was— 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1138 8 0 1613 12 0 The plan of exposing the letter D in the front window when an inhabitant requires the dust removed has answered satisfactorily. The removal of dust is better attended to than in years past, but there are large accumulations speaking generally, and this to a great extent is due to the neglect of the inhabitants themselves in not sufficiently recognising the necessity for its removal. To show how enormous is the quantity of dust and the accumulations of decomposing matter, it is enough to mention 62 that upwards of 18,000 loads of dust were removed during the year. SCAVENGING.—The system adopted by the Vestry two years since of accepting the proposals of two contractors, viz.: one for the Eastern and one for the Western Division, has been found to work satisfactorily, and is the means of getting the work done in an efficient manner. Despite the long and severe winter, the complaints were very few. WATERING THE ROADS.—The system of hiring vans, carts, horses, men, &c., to water the roads and streets, under the immediate supervision of the Vestry's officers, has worked well. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. R. FLETCHER, Sanitary Inspector. 63 Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. To the Lighting Committee of the Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. April, 1880. Gentlemen, In presenting the following Tables shewing the operation of the Average Meter System during the second year and a comparison with that under the Old System, I beg to say that the total cost of Gas Lighting and Maintenance to 1389 Lamps for the year is £5693 7s. 3d. The cost under the Old System to 1224 Lamps would have been nearly the same, being 165 Lamps in favor of present system. The difference between the cost of Gas Lighting and Maintenance for the past two years, and what it would have been under the Old System with the same number of Lamps, and allowing for the reduction in the price of gas in each case, is £1782 4s. 5½d., which is £286 12s. 11d½d. more than covers the first outlay on Meters, etc. in favor of the present system. There is a further receipt of £52 3s. 1d. for Lamps to be paid for by railways and theatres. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, CHAS. DOUGHTY, Inspector. 64 TABLE I.
