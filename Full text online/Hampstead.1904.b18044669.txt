The following Chart shews the number of deaths of persons resident in or belonging to the Borough occurring during each week of 1904 Death Rate The crude death rate was 13.1 per 1000 of the population but after subtracting from the total registered deaths the deaths of nonresident persons dying in Hampstead and adding the deaths of Hampstead residents who died outside the district the true or corrected death rate was 10.3 per 1000 of the population as compared with the rate of 9.8 per 1000 of the population in 1903. The average rata for the 10 years 1894 —1903, was 11.3. It is of interest to note that this is the second lowest rate ever recorded for Hampstead the lowest being that of 1903.

The total mortality from this class of disease was 140, or 15.7 per cent, of the total deaths, of which -46 or 32.8 per cent, occurred in children under the age of 5 years, and 42 or 302 per cent, in persons of 65 years of age or upwards. Of the total deaths, 69 were due to Pneumonia, 57 to Bronchitis, and 14 to other diseases of the respiratory organs. Accidents. Of the 20 deaths classified under this heading, 10 were due to falls, 1 to burns 1 to a street accident, 7 to suffocation, and 1 to a railway accident. Suicides. Of the 8 deaths from this cause, 5 were due to poisoning, I to shooting, 1 to a fall from a window, and 1 to being run over by a train. Murder. Two deaths from Murder were registered, both cases of infants and due to want of attention at birth. All other Causes. Under the heading of all other causes in Table IV page 95 are included the following:— Inanition Debility from birth and Marasmus 16 Epilepsy 3 Anuerism 1 Cerebral hœmorrhage Thrombosis, Embolism, Hemiplegia, Apoplexy 46 Senile Decay 65 Diseases of Kidney (Acute and Chronic) 39 Rheumatism (Acute and Chronic) 6 Appendicitis 8 Syphilis 1 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Of the notifiable Zymotic diseases 494 cases equivalent to an attack rate of 3.5 per 1000 of the population and comprising 159 of Scarlet Fever, 26 of Enteric Fever, 55 of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup, 6 of Puerperal Fever, 54 of Erysipelas, 1 of Continued Fever, and 193 of Chicken-pox, were notified during the year, with a mortality of 20 ; Chart shewing the monthly notifications of all Notifiable Infectious Diseases (excepting Chickenpox) during 1904, and previous year. Dotted lines denote Monthly Notifications of all Notifiable Infectious Diseases (excepting Chickenpox) in 1903. while Whooping Cough Measles, and Epidemic Diarrhoea, to which notification does not apply, contributed 36 deaths. With regard to Chicken-pox, the London County Council's Order making this disease compulsorily notifiable, came into operation on the 8th April, and was in force for four months. A further Order extended the period for another three months. This Order continued in force until the 7th November. The total mortality from all the Zymotic diseases was 56, representing a Zymotic death rate of 0.65 per 1000 of the population, as compared with 43 or 0.50 per 1000 of the population in 1903. The mortality from the 7 principal Zymotic diseases was 48, representing a death rate of 0.55 per 1000 of the population. The mortality from the 7 principal Zymotic: diseases in 1903 was 42, and the death rate was 0.49 per 1000 of the population.

One supposed case was removed, but was afterwards returned certified to be not suffering from Smallpox. Scarlet Fever. 159 cases were notified, as compared with 165 in 1903, and the attack rate per 1000 of the population was 1.83. Two deaths were recorded, equal to 1.2 per cent, of the cases notified, or or 0.02 per 1000 of the population. Of the cases notified, 120 or 75 per cent, were removed to hospital. The houses in which cases occurred were inspected and the drains examined. Defective drains were found in 36 instances, defective soil pipes in 33 instances, defective water supplies in 38 instances, and general defects in 48 instances. Owing to a fairly large number of cases occurring, which were traced to the Emmanuel Schools, Mill Lane, I communicated with the Medical Officer of the Education Department of the London County Council on the subject. The whole School was closed in October for a period of three weeks, when the outbreak ceased. The Sunday School in connection with the Church was also closed for the same period.

It will be seen from the following table that the disease was rather more prevalent in September than any other month. Of the total cases 5 proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 19.2 per cent, or 0.06 per 1000 of the population. The sanitary conitary condition of houses in which the cases occurred was investigated and the drains tested. Defective drains were found in 4 instances, defective soil pipes in 7 instances, defective water supplies in 5 instances, and general defects in 10 instances.

The houses in which the cases occurred were inspected, and defective drains were found in 2 instances, defective soil pipes in 2 instances, and general defects in 3 instances. The Ward distribution of these cases is as follows:—2 in Ward 1, 2 in Ward 2, and 2 in Ward 3. Erysipelas. 54 cases were notified, and 4 deaths occurred, as compared with 41 cases and 1 death in 1903. The case mortality was 7.4 per cent. The attack rate per 1000 of the population was 0.62, and the death rate 0.04. Of the cases notified 5 or 9 per cent., were removed to hospital. Cases of Erysipelas notified in each Month. Jan. Feb.

This disease was, by Orders of the London County Council, made compulsorily notifiable from 8th April until 7th November, and during this period 193 cases were notified ; these were distributed as follows : — Town Ward 85, Belsize Ward 13, Adelaide Ward 19, Central Ward 22, West End Ward 11, Kilburn Ward 27, and Priory Ward 16. So far as I am aware in no case was the diagnosis doubtful Whooping Cough. This disease accounted for 8 deaths during the year, as compared with 15 in 1903. Measles. 15 deaths were recorded from this disease, as compared with 8 in 1903. The mortality was 0.17 per 1000 of the population. Measles is now included amongst the dangerous infectious diseases in so far as Sections 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, and 74 the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, apply. The Sections in question, while not making the disease compulsorily notifiable, extend to it provisions relating to isolation and disinfection. During the year under review 741 cases have been brought to my knowledge, the sources of information of which were as follows:— Cases notified by medical practitioners 53 parents or guardians 142 head teachers of schools 531 employers and others 5 Death Returns 10 741 In 166 cases it was found, on enquiry, no doctor was in attendance. The fact of this large number of Measles cases being without medical attendance is a matter of grave importance considering the serious complications which so often follow the high death rate, and the fact that each case reported keeps from School a number of children not themselves ill. Amongst the poorest families it is almost impossible to properly nurse cases of Measles at home. The mother of the family is obliged to give up doing any wage earning work in order to nurse the patient, thus lessening the income at a time when expenses are necessarily increased. The family is debarred from the help from district nurses and isolation from hospitals which it would receive in case of non-infectious illness; while the hospitals provided for infectious diseases do not receive cases of Measles. The following Table shews the Ward and Month distribution of the cases of Measles:— Total No. of Cases Ward 1 (Town) Ward 2 (Belsize) Ward 3 (Adelaide) Ward 4 (Central) Ward 5 (WestEnd) Ward 6 (Kilburn) Ward 7 (Priory) Month.

Dear Sir or Madam, MEASLES. I beg to call your attention to the fact that there is a marked prevalence of Measles amongst children attending several of the Schools in the Borough. This disease is now included amongst the dangerous infectious diseases referred to in the London Public Health Act; the object being the isolation of the infected persons and the disinfection of infected rooms and articles of clothing, &c. In order that I may enforce these measures, may I ask you to be good enough to give me early information of any cases you become aware of amongst your scholars, their relations, or other inmates of the houses in which they reside. Yours faithfully, Herbert Littlejohn, Medical Officer of Health. To the Head Teacher. Epidemic Diarrhœa. The number of deaths registered from this cause was 13 as compared with 4 in 1903.

Totals 10 3 13 Deaths from Diarrhœa. 12 of these deaths took place in the three months July to September. Age incidence.—Of the 13 cases, 10 were under one year, 2 were between one and two years of age, while one was a person over 60 years of age. 10 deaths were investigated, i.e., 8 of infants, and 2 of children between the ages of one and two years. Manner of feeding.—The 8 infants had all been fed by a proper bottle. 3 by the obnoxious long tubed bottle. 2 children had been fed with cow's milk and barley water. 1 child „ „ water. 1 „ „ „ lime water. 1 „ „ Nestlé's milk and barley water. 1 „ „ „ lime water. 1 „ „ Benger's food. 1 „ „ miscellaneous diet. Previous health.—Of the 8 infants: in 3 cases the children were stated to have been previously delicate; in 5 cases the children were stated to have been healthy until the diarrhœa set in. The two children over one year were both stated to have been delicate from birth. Duration of illness.—Of the 10 cases, 4 died within three days of the onset, 2 within a week, 2 in fourteen days; while in two cases the illness lasted several months. Of the 10 houses visited, in only 2 were other cases of diarrhœa found to have occurred. The houses were in each case inspected. Insanitary conditions were discovered in 6 out of 10 houses. In 2 instances the homes were found in an exceptionally dirty and neglected state. Influenza. 11 deaths resulted from this disease, as compared with 12 in 1903. Of the total deaths, 2 occurred to persons between 1 and under 5 years of age, 2 to persons between 25 and 65 years of age, and 7 to persons of 65 years of age or upwards. Pulmonary Phthisis. The deaths from this disease amounted to 73 as compared with 66 in 1903. In the following table the deaths are distributed in Wards, and it will be noted that the mortality was greatest in the Kilburn Ward. Phthisis Deaths arranged in Wards. Ward 1 (Town).

Of these 65 deaths, 24 were of notified cases and 41 were of nonnotified cases. Deaths of Notified Cases.—Of these 24 deaths, 19 were notified during 1904, 3 in 1903, and 2in 1902. 8 of the deaths occurred in the Workhouse Infirmary, 1 at Friedenheim, and 15 at the homes of the patients. Disinfection was carried out in 12 of the cases which died at home. Of the 8 deaths which occured in the Workhouse, disinfection had been carried out in 6 instances on the removal of the patient to that Institution. Deaths of Non-notified Cases.—4l deaths took place of cases which had not been notified. Of these, 32 occurred in private houses and 9 in Institutions. Of the 32 deaths in private houses, 9 were not visited on account of the social position of the deceased, 23 were visited and disinfection was offered but only accepted in 13 instances. In 4 other cases, partial measures of disinfection were carried out by the families of the deceased. The 65 "residents" who died in Hampstead consisted of 31 males and 34 females; the occupations were as follows:— Males. Females. No occupation 1 No occupation given in death return Bank manager 1 17 Bank clerk 1 Boot fitter 1 Baths superintendent 1 Charwomen 2 Blacksmith 1 Domestic servants 4 1 Cabinet maker and carpenters Draper's assistant 2 Dressmakers 2 Caretaker 1 Housewives 5 Civil engineer 1 Lady's maid 1 Coachman 1 Typist 1 Coal merchant 1 Cook (Restaurant) 1 Crossing sweeper 1 French polisher 1 Gas fitter 1 Horsekeeper 1 House painter 1 Labourers 4 Milk carrier 1 Pianoforte maker 1 Police constable 1 Postmen 2 Road sweeper 1 1 Tobacconist Upholsterer 1 Upholsterer's porter 1 Woollen merchant 1 In comparing the number of phthisis deaths with the notified cases it is interesting to note the relative numbers of males to females. Males. Females. Deaths 31 34 Notified cases 23 16 VOLUNTARY NOTIFICATION. 42 notifications of cases of phthisis were received during 1904, being 5 more than in 1903. Of these cases, 2 were twice notified during the year, and 1 had been already notified in a previous year: there were therefore 39 new cases notified during 1904. Of these, 23 were of males and 16 females Of the total cases notified, 19 died during the year and 13 within, one month after notification. In 35 instances the circumstances in connection with the patient and his disease were investigated, with the following results: — In 13, or 37 per cent. of the cases, a definite history of Phthisis having occurred amongst other members of the family was obtained. In 13, or 37 per cent. of the cases, there was no family history of Phthisis or of other Tubercular disease, but in 2 instances it appeared that other members of the family had suffered from chest affections. In 9 instances, or 26 per cent. of the cases, no particulars as to family history were obtainable. Disinfection of rooms and bedding was carried out in 27 instances with regard to cases notified during 1904, and in 3 cases was twice performed during the year. The following is a list of the occupations of the 35 cases where investigations were made:— 1 Blacksmith 1 Cabinet maker 1 Charwoman 1 Coal Porter 1 Cook, restaurant 1 Crossing Sweeper 1 Domestic Servants 2 Dressmakers 2 Ex-Soldier 1 Baths Superintendent Ex-Naval Officer 1 Fireman 1 Gasfitter 1 House Painter 1 Housewives 6 Ironer 1 Labourers 4 Milliner 1 Needlewoman 1 Page 1 Plasterer 1 Postman 1 Roadsweeper 1 Typist 1 Upholsterer's Porter 1 35 Insanitary conditions were found in 15 instances on the inspection of the dwellings of cases, while overcrowding was discovered in 2 instances. In connection with cases of Phthisis notified or otherwise brought to the knowledge of the Public Health Department, rooms were disinfected in 55 instances, bedding in 51 instances. SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. Inspection of Workshops (other than Bakehouses). Number of Inspections.- Workshop Laundries 16 Other Workshops 1245 Workrooms measured 93 Cleanliness. —35 Workrooms were found on inspection in such a condition as to require cleansing. In 25 cases the occupier at once took the necessary steps to remedy the conditions complained of, but in the other 10 instances notices had to be served before the nuisance was abated. Ventilation. —The section of the Factory and Workshop Act dealing with ventilation is one of the most difficult to enforce; many of the workers are unaccustomed to ventilation in their homes, and therefore dislike fresh air in the workroom. The result is that windows and ventilators are closed. The attention of the workers and the employers is directed to the importance to health of proper ventilation when work is in progress. In 7 workrooms the means of ventilation was improved, in 4 cases after notice had been served. Warming.—2 workrooms were found to be warmed by gas Moves without flues, and 1 workroom was without heating apparatus of any kind. In all 3 cases the occupiers arranged to heat the workroom in a proper manner. Overcrowding. —10 workrooms were found to be overcrowded. In 2 instances the overcrowding was abated forthwith, but intimation notices had to be served in the remaining cases before the number of workers was reduced.

This is due, no doubt, to the difficulty of hand laundries competing successfully with the large steam "Factory Laundries," and partly to the hand laundries removing further from London in order to get larger premises at lower rents.

At the end of 1904, there were 38 Bakehouses on the Register, 23 being under and 15 over ground. This is a decrease in the total number, of 3, and is due to the fact that there are 4 less underground bakehouses, and 1 more overground bakehouse. A list of the Bakehouses on the Register at the end of the year will be found in Table XVI, page 110. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. The bakehouses situated at 26, New End, and 48, High Street, were closed during the year, the properties having been compulsorily acquired by the London County Council and the Charing Cross and Hampstead Railway Company, respectively. Aboveground Bakehouses. These have been regularly inspected during the year. The number of inspections made amounted to 66. A new bakehouse has been built at 19, New End, in place of one at 26, New End. Underground Bakehouses. The question of the duties imposed on the Council by Section 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, was dealt with at length in my Annual Report for 1903.

HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT 1890. Part I Kilburn Vale Area. The Representation of this Area, together with the resolutions of the London County Council, and the letter from the Secretary of State upon the subject (set out in ray Annual Report for 1903), are still under the consideration of the Housing Committee. Part II. Silver Street Area. The Council on the 3rd March adopted the report of the Housing Committee, stating that they had considered the question of this area, and recommended that no further action should be taken in the matter pending the development of the suggested scheme for a Garden Suburb adjoining WYldes Farm, North End. In answer to an inquiry from their Medical Officer received in June, the London County Council were informed of this resolution. Part III. The question of the extent and condition of the Housing accommodation available for the Working Classes resident in the Fleet Road district, formed the subject of considerable investigation and enquiry by the Housing Committee as a result of which the following conclusions embodied in a report adopted by the Council were arrived at — That— 1.—There is no accommodation to spare. 2.—Much of the existing accommodation is bad. 3.—There is an evident tendency to overcrowd. 4.—That the rents are high. 5.—That the death rate is considerably higher than the average for the whole Borough notwithstanding the nearness to the Heath, and the extent of open spaces. To improve this state of things the following remedies were suggested:— 1.—The vigilant enforcement of the sanitary regulations. 2. —The provision of accommodation for the persons who would be displaced as the result of such action. With a view to the provision of such accommodation negotiations for the acquisition of a piece of vacant land at the corner of Lower Cross Road and Upper Park Road were brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and the following scheme was prepared by the Borough Engineer, and approved by the Council on 28th April:— Short description of proposed Housing Scheme, Lower Cross Road. The plans provide accommodation for a total of 248 persons housed in three blocks. The following table shews the disposition of the 42 tenements in the blocks:— Two-roomed tenements. Three-roomed tenements. Four-roomed tenements. Block "A" 8 8 Block "B" 10 Block "C" 4 12 12 10 20 It is proposed that the entrance to each block should be from the open courtyard, the courtyard itself being approachcd from Lower Cross Road by an opening sufficiently wide to admit a cart. By this arrangement of entrances, constant traffic through the courtyard (of value for supervision) is ensured, and the carrying through the street of the dust-pails to the dust-bins in the courtyard is obviated. Each tenement is provided with a scullery, larger than the usual tenement scullery, containing sink and coal hunker, and a w.c. placed as far as possible from the living rooms, with a ventilated lobby between. - - - - The rooms are well lighted, 8 feet 10 inches high in the clear, and better proportioned than in many dwellings, very narrow widths being avoided. The recognised minimum area has been observed on the ground floor, with rather larger dimensions on the floors above and the more rooms a tenement contains the larger the living room. The following table shews the average areas of rooms for the various sized tenements:— Living rooms. Bedrooms. Four-roomed tenements 164 feet 118 feet. Three-roomed tenements 170 feet 110 feet. Two-roomed tenements 152 feet 108 feet. Note —About 12 feet superficial of these living-rooms is due to a passageway to scullery being thrown into room, but the space is available for no purpose other than passage. Each tenement has two cupboards (one ventilated for food), and dresser shelving in addition. In regard to construction, it is proposed that all partitions other than brick shall be of breeze and cement concrete 3 inches thick, and all dividing floors and staircases of steel and concrete. The floors of living-rooms and bedrooms to be finished with floor boards on battens nailed direct on to the concrete, and the staircases, landings, sculleries, and w.c.'s with granolithic paving. The walls of the staircases and landings it is proposed should be faced with a dado of salt-glazed bricks and flettons above. The scullery walls are to be rendered in cement for a height of 4 feet from the floor line, and all internal walls (except staircases and landings mentioned above) finished with washable distemper. Portable ranges (each with an oven and a boiler fed by cold water cistern) will be fitted in the living rooms, and mantel registers in the bedrooms. The elevations are to be of Luton bricks at the base, with picked stock facings and red brick strings and arches above, and the top storey finished in rough cast. Tiles are proposed as the roof covering for all the blocks. The courtyard is to be paved with tar paving- The rents proposed to be charged for the various tenements are as follows:— 4-roomed tenements 11s. 6d. 3 9s. 0d. (Block "A") 6s. 9d. "C") 6s. 6d.

In many cases this has involved extensive structural alterations.

Winchester Mews, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. In addition, the following Mews dwellings have been remodelled and put in a Sanitary condition:— Quex Mews, 1—5. Steeles Mews South, 7. Victoria Yard, 3. Alteration of Standing Orders respecting the duties of the Public Health and Housing Committees. By resolution of the Council of 21st January, the Standing Orders were altered, resulting in the transference from the Housing to the Public Health Committee, of the duty of carrying out all matters arising under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except in so far as it relates to the provision of new buildings for the working classes and all matters relating thereto. Houses let in Lodgings. No inspections for the purpose of enforcing the Bye-laws made under Section 94 of the Public Health Act have been made during the year owing to the penalty clause in the existing Bye-laws being practically identical with that contained in the Bye-laws of the Boroughs of Islington and Stepney which the High Court declared to be unreasonable, owing to the absence of a provision for the service of a notice before a person became liable to a penalty. On the 12th July, the Public Health Committee referred the question of these Bye-laws to a Sub-Committee consisting of Councillors Lyell (Chairman), Gard and Hendrick. The matter is still the subject of negotiation with the Local Government Board. Sanitary Bye-laws. Administration by Bye-law is one of the essentials of local government. This being so, and in view of the fact that all Bye-laws have to be confirmed by the Local Government Board or one of the other Departments of State before they take effect, it seems to me that this confirmation should be accepted as sufficient guarantee that their provisions are reasonable. To frame a Code of Bye-laws which could be relied upon to survive all attacks likely to be made upon them on the ground of their being unreasonable, does not appear to be within the range of possibility, especially when it is remembered that the penalty clauses to which exception was successfully taken in the cases of Nokes v. Islington Borough Council and Stiles v. Galinski were based upon the directions of Parliament, laid down in Section 183 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and made applicable to the Metropolis by the First Schedule of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The set back to sanitary administration and progress which results from the Bye-laws of a Sanitary Authority being declared invalid, by a decision of the High Court, is so serious as, in my opinion, to demand prompt legislation to ensure that the provisions of Bye-laws made by a local authority and duly confirmed in the manner prescribed by the Act under which they are made, should have full validity and force. Overcrowding. Fourteen complaints of overcrowding were received, but upon investigation only 6 were found to be accurate, and in each case the nuisance was abated upon the service of a Notice. It is interesting to note that in many streets in the Borough where the mode of occupation of the houses has changed from family residences to tenement houses, the rooms are both large and lofty. In such cases it is possible for the rooms to be occupied both for living and sleeping purposes by several persons, and yet not be overcrowded according to the standard now usually accepted, viz.:—400 cubic feet per adult (2 children under 10 years of age counting as 1 adult). The following are characteristic instances:— No. of Rooms. Actual No. of Occupants. Total No. of Occupants permissable (Adults). District. Adults. Children. (Adults). 16 17 Fleet Road 8 26 2 5 Lowfield Road 8 24 16 18½ Netherwood Street 9 37½ 15 11 20½ Palmerston Road 11 34 14 5 16½ Upper Park Road 24½ 13 12 19 8 The Medical Officer of Health of the London Comity Council in a Report based upon the figures of the Census of 1901, states that there are 864 "Overcrowded tenements" in Hampstead, every tenement of less than 5 rooms occupied to the extent of more than 2 persons per room being regarded as an overcrowded tenement. The table which is set out above, shews that on an average 3 persons may occupy each room in such houses without infringing the law, consequently the number of overcrowded tenements mnst be considerably less than the number quoted in the report referred to. FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. During the year, 406 samples were taken for analysis, an increase of 40 over the number taken in 1903. Of these, 8, or 1.9 per cent., were found to be adulterated. The samples were as follows:— Number of Samples taken. Nature of Article. Ale 2 Arrowroot 2 Brandy 2 Butter 108 Camphorated Oil 2 Cheese 21 Cocoa 11 Cod Liver Oil Emulsion 1 Coffee 37 Cream of Tartar 1 Glycerine 3 Ground Rice 1 Lard 20 Lemon Squash 2 Milk 173 Mustard 5 Olive Oil 2 Pepper 6 Porter 2 Rum 1 Tapioca 2 Tea 1 Whiskey 1 406 The following statement shows the nature of the samples which were found on analysis to be adulterated and in each case the percentage of samples adulterated to those analysed:— Number adulterated. Percentage of adulterated to total taken. Nature of Article. Butter 2 1.8 per cent. Cod Liver Oil Emulsion 1 100 Coffee 1 2.7 Milk 4 2.3 8 In addition to these adulterated samples, 14 samples of milk have been reported as being of low quality. The following table gives a comparison of the work accomplished from 1901-1904. Samples analysed. Number adulterated. Percentage adulterated. Fines and Costs. Year. 1 I 1 i r I £ d. s. 1901 306 6 1.9 1.3 15 0 1902 315 4.7 42 7 6 15 1903 366 14 3.8 37 3 0 1904 406 8 1.9 35 8 6 It will be seen from this table that the percentage of adulteration has materially decreased, although the number of samples taken has increased each year. I am satisfied that the rigid administration of the Food and Drugs Acts, and the imposition of substantial penalties where convictions are obtained, is the surest way to safeguard the purity of the food supply. The following table shews a comparison of the Wards in the Borough in respect of Food Adulteration:— Samples analysed. Number adulterated. Percentage adulterated Ward.

Prosecutions were ordered in 6 instances, with the following results:— Fine.

No. 127, Cod Liver Oil Emulsion, was purchased with a guarantee that it contained 33 per cent. of Cod Liver Oil, but upon analysis it wasfound to be deficient to the extent of 9½ per cent. No. 135, Milk, was 9 2/3 per cent. deficient in butter fat. In both the above cases, the Council gave instructions for the vendors to be cautioned. The food offered for sale on and near the Heath on all Bank Holidays has been carefully inspected, and samples purchased for analysis. One sample of milk was found to be 90 per cent. deficient in fat, the vendor of which was fined £1 and 16s. costs; and another contained 8 per cent. of added water, the vendors of which were summonsed, but relied upon the warranty defence, and the case was dismissed without costs. Warranty Clause.ln October, the question of the difficult position of local authorities in administering the Acts owing to the "warranty clause" in the Act of 1899, was considered by the Public Health Committee; and the Council, on the 20th October, resolved to call the attention of the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture to the difficult and anomalous position of local authorities in administrating the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, owing to the use, or abuse, of warranties given under such Acts, particularly in cases of adulterated milk, and to urge the necessity for the position being considered by the above Departments, with a view to amending legislation being introduced to prevent that evasion of the Acts which the warranty defence now makes possible. Unsound Food. During the year, the inspection of food supply has been systematic ally carried out. The following table shews the seizures or surrenders which have taken place. Date. Unsound Food Seized or Surrendered. Premises. April 4th 1 tin pineapple. Hampstead Heath April 8th The Parade, Cricklewood 20 lbs. butter. April 9th High Road 6lbs. dates, 1 tin peaches. June 7th Mill Lane 1 pork pie. June 24th Boundary Road 2 bushels potatoes, 3 lbs. lemons. July 30th High Road 2 lbs. apples. July 30th High Road 6 lbs.apples, 3 lbs. tomatoes. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops. At the end of the year 1903, there were 89 persons on the register occupying 110 shops, as follows:— Dairies 51 Bakers and Confectioners 28 Restaurants and Coffee Shops 10 General Shops 21 and during 1904, the following additions were made to the register:— Persons registered as milk sellers (previously trading without being registered) 5 Persons registered as milk sellers owing to change of proprietorship 6 New premises opened as milk shops by persons already registered 1 The names of 2 persons who had discontinued selling milk were removed, so that at the end of the year the register comprised 90 persons, occupying 114 shops, as follows:— Dairies 50 Bakers and Confectioners 29 Restaurants and Coffee Shops 11 General Shops 24 These orders only require the registration of persons, any of whom may occupy more than one shop in the Borough. This accounts for the difference between the number of persons registered and the shops occupied. Inspections of premises where milk is sold 347 On January 2nd, an inspection of a certain milkshop in the Town Ward was made, when it was found that the milk utensils and the premises generally were in a dirty condition. Proceedings were taken against the occupier, who was fined £5 and costs. With this exception, the conditions under which milk has been sold have been on the whole found to be satisfactory. Table of sanitary works carried out at shops within the Borough where milk is sold:— Premises or parts of premises cleansed and whitewashed 20 Lumber removed from premises 5 Water cisterns cleansed 6 Water cisterns covered 3 Drains amended or reconstructed and ventilated 4 Drains unstopped 4 Soil pipes reconstructed 4 Water closet accommodation provided 2 Water closets amended or reconstructed 5 Water closets cleansed 8 Flushing cisterns to water closets repaired 4 Improperly placed gully traps removed 1 Gully traps cleansed 6 Waste pipes of sinks trapped 3 Dilapidated premises repaired (walls and ceilings) 3 Roofs and guttering repaired 6 Movable metal dust bins provided 6 Yard paving repaired or renewed 8 Yards cleansed 3 Ice Cream Shops. There are at the present time 69 premises in the Borough where ice cream is made and sold. These, and the barrows of street vendors, have been regularly inspected and their condition found to be generally satisfactory. Number of inspections of ice cream shops, 118. In addition to these, the barrows on Hampstead Heath on Bank Holidays were inspected. The majority of the barrows which vend ice cream in the streets of the Borough are sent out by a shopkeeper in the Kilburn Ward. One barrow had no name and address on. The attendant was cautioned, and has since given no further cause for complaint. Table of sanitary work carried out: — Premises or parts of premises cleansed and limewashed 1 Drains amended or reconstructed 1 Water closets cleansed 4 Gully traps cleansed 2 Yard paving repaired 1 Roofs repaired 1 Rainwater pipes disconnected from drain 1 Waste pipes disconnected from drain 1 Flushing cisterns to water-closets repaired 1 Water cisterns repaired 1 London Milk Supply. In January, the Islington Borough Council communicated with your Council on this subject, and as the result of the report of the Public Health Committee, your Council, in May, adopted the following recommendations:— "That the Council do signify its agreement with the Islington Borough Council that additional powers of control over the London milk supply are needed, and in particular:— (i) Power for the London County Council to prevent the introduction into London of unwholesome milk, and for that purpose to take samples outside London. (ii) Powers to enable the London County Council outside London, and each local sanitary authority in its own district, to take immediate action where serious infectious disease is suspected, subject to proper compensation. (iii) Power for the London County Council or the local authority to require from purveyors of milk all necessary information; and That the London County Council and Islington Borough Council be informed accordingly. By the provisions of Section 27 of the London County Council Powers) Act, 1904, which came into operation on the 15th August, powers were conferred on the London County Council to cause any cow in any dairyfarm or cowshed in the County which is suspected to he suffering from Tuberculosis of the udder, to be removed and slaughtered. This is a most important enactment, but as there are no cowsheds within the Borough, and I have no reason to believe that any part of the milk supplied within the district is derived from within the County of London, it is obvious that before Hampstead can be effectually protected, powers to prevent the introduction of unwholesome milk from without the County are urgently needed. Boracic Acid and other Preservatives in Food. In June a communication was received from the Camberwell Borough Council asking that your Council should communicate with the Local Government Board pointing out the importance of fixing a limit to the amount of Boracic Acid which may be mixed with food stuffs. The matter was referred to the Public Health Committee, to whom I presented a report upon the subject. The Committee recommended the Council to support the application of the Camberwell Borough Council, and also that at the same time it be suggested that the recommendations on this subject of the Departmental Committee of 1901 should be given effect to. This recommendation was adopted by the Council on the 7th July. That such preservatives are unnecessary, is shewn by the fact that according to your Analyst's Report, of the 173 samples of Milk and 108 samples of Butter taken in the Borough during the year, in no case was Boracic Acid or other preservative found to be present. Slaughter-houses. There are 5 slaughter-houses in the Borough, and these have been regularly inspected during the year. On the 3rd October the annual inspection was made, in view of the approach of the licensing session, by the Public Health Committee, who decided not to oppose any of the licenses. Table of inspections and work carried out:— Inspections made 159 Lime washing carried out 20 Lumber removed from slaughter-houses 2 New flushing cistern to water closet 1 Water closets cleansed 4 New galvanized iron offal bins provided 2 The following is a list of the existing slaughter-houses in the Borough:— 40, England's Lane 17, High Street 69 High Street 242, Belsize Road; 6, Fairfax Mews. Restaurant Kitchens. These kitchens have been kept under observation during the year and their sanitary conditions supervised. Reference to Table XVII page 111 gives a, list of the 49 restaurant kitchens on the Register at the end 1904. Premises where Food is Prepared or Stored. During the year the Sanitary Inspectors have visited the various food shops in the Borough. The instances in which it became necessary to draw the occupiers' attention to matters in regard to which improvement might with advantage be effected, were few in number, but there can be no doubt that the visits of the Inspectors were of considerable value. The number of premises inspected during the year, together with the nature of the business carried on, are as follows:— Butchers and pork butchers 57 Confectioners 44 Grocers. 72 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 65 Provision and cheesemongers 47 Fishmongers 21 Fried fish 5 General shops 20 331 Cow-Houses. There has been no licensed cow-house in the Borough since 1898. Common Lodging Houses. There is now no common lodging house in the Borough. Offensive Trades. There are no offensive trades carried on within the Borough. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS. During the year, applications were received for Certificates under this Act in respect to 168 dwellings, being 127 in excess of the number applied for in 1903. Each application involves a detailed survey of the dwelling, as well as an inspection of the drains and sanitary fittings. In most cases a considerable amount of work has had to be carried out before the premises were in such a condition as to entitle the owner to a Certificate. It will be readily understood that this has resulted in a great increase in the work of the staff of my department, and illustrates how year by year additional duties and responsibilities are imposed upon Local Sanitary Authorities and their Officers. The following is a list of the 102 "dwellings" certified by me in 1904, together with the date of certification: — Date when Certified. No. of Dwellings.

So far as I am aware, beyond the Quarterly Returns from the Registrar General, there exists no official arrangement by which the Medical Officer of Health of a Metropolitan Borough can become aware of the occurrence of outlying deaths belonging to his district, unless the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the death occurs, upon receipt of the information from the Local Registrar of Births and Deaths, forwards it to him. Nor can the Medical Officer of Health of a district outside the Metropolis receive similar information as to outlying deaths rightly belonging to his district. The practice of forwarding full information concerning such deaths to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned, I have carried out since March, 1904. During each year, I no doubt receive the Quarterly Returns above mentioned, but those only refer to persons dying in Public Institutions. In 1904 these amounted to 91, while in only 4 instances were particulars of outlying deaths supplied to me from districts outside the Metropolis. In view of the foregoing, and of the number of hospitals throughout the country, and also the number of "Hampstead Residents," who for various reasons may be residing away from home, it is obvious that a number of deaths must occur which should properly be taken into consideration in calculating our death rate. As the principle involved affects not only Hampstead, but all sanitary districts, it appears to me that it would be advantageous, in the interests of greater accuracy, if a system of distributing information of this nature to the districts concerned was inaugurated. This might easily be carried out if all Registrars of Births and Deaths were directed to notify the occurrence of such deaths to the Registrars of the districts in which the deceased persons had residence. The alternative to such an arrangement, would be for the information to be forwarded from the Registrar General's Office, upon the receipt of the Registrar's Quarterly returns. Inspection of Nuisances. During the year 11,927 inspections have been made by the District and other Inspectors, and in 12,266 instances premises were re-inspected, as compared with 8,002 inspection and 13,865 re-inspections in 1903. Dust Shoots. The demand for a device by which house refuse from dwellings built on the flat principle could be readily disposed of with a minimum amount of trouble to the tenants, led to the construction of what are known as "dust shoots." These consist of a brick or metal flue, constructed in or upon one of the main walls of the building, extending to the top flat, and usually terminating in a brick ashpit at or below the ground level. There is an opening to this flue on each floor, either inside the kitchen or scullery or immediately outside the window or door. In addition to the ordinary house refuse, all kinds of decomposing animal and vegetable matter are deposited in these shoots, and consequently their condition soon becomes far more offensive than that of a drain owing to the fact that they are neither flushed nor trapped. They are especially liable to get choked through bulky rubbish being placed in their, and when the wind is in certain directions it is almost impossible for dust to be shot into them without some of it blowing back into the dwelling. It does not appear to me that any building (whether flats or model dwellings) can be regarded as being provided with suitable dust receptacles where this arrangement exists, in fact, they are frequently the subject of complaint. Dust shoots have been abolished and in their place proper sanitary moveable receptacles provided, in the following instances: — No. of Dust Shoots abolished.

An abnormal fall of rain occurred on the 25th July, of which "Symons Meteoroligical Magazinefor August gives the following particulars:— "Registered at Burrard Road, West Hampstead, 2.24 inches." "Registered at Camden Square, 1.7l inches." At the latter Station, the following details are also supplied:- Several gentle showers during the forenoon and afternoon of yesterday yielded 0.20 inches, the thunderstorm from 6.45 to to 7.30 p.m. brought down 0.99 inches (of which 0.40 fell in 10 minutes), between 9 and 11 p.m. 0.50 inches fell, and a slight shower some time after midnight brought the total for the day up to 1.7l inches. At this time, complaints were received of the flooding of premises in Bell Terrace, West End Lane, Fleet Road, and Holtham Road. In Bell Terrace and West End Lane the houses were of the nonbasement type, but the level of the ground floor was in each case below that of the adjoining street, and the trouble was primarily due to the forecourts not being provided with a proper drain. This defect has since been remedied. In Fleet Road and Holtham Road no doubt the sewers became surcharged, a state of things liable to recur in times of heavy rainfall. The London County Council are, however, dealing with the matter, and have decided to spend a considerable sum upon the construction of relief sewers; contracts for about two-thirds of the proposed expenditure have, I understand, already been entered into. The whole scheme will be completed as early as is possible in view of the magnitude of the works involved. It is to be hoped that the benefits of these works will extend to Hampstead. Effluvium Nuisances. The Memorial of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood complaining of the nuisance caused by the frying of fish at a shop in Broomsleigh Street was still under consideration when my Annual Report for 1903 (page 77) was issued. At the suggestion of the Council, the occupier of the premises carried the flue from the frying room to above the roofs of the houses immediately adjoining, and since this improvement has been carried out, no further complaints have been received. The complaints of effluvium nuisances received during the year were as follows:— Asphalting 1 Ammonia flues 1 Ballast burning 4 Fish curing 1 Offal burning 1 Of these, all but one, viz. that of offal burning, proved to be well founded. Legal proceedings had to be taken before two of the ballast fires were extinguished, but in each of the other cases the nuisance was promptly abated upon the matter being brought to the notice of the responsible persons. Smoke Nuisances. In January the furnace of one of the steam navvies employed on the widening of the Midland Railway at Mill Lane was found to be emitting black smoke in such quantities as to be a nuisance. The matter was reported to the Public Health Committee, who gave instructions for the contractor to be cautioned. Subsequently a number of communications were received from the London County Council, stating that their Inspector had found the engine in question offending on days and at times specified. Numerous observations were kept by your Inspectors without any further infringements of the law being discovered. The Public Health Committee, in considering the matter, declined to take action without the evidence of its own Officers, and directed that a letter be sent to the London County Council giving the names and addresses of three Sanitary Inspectors residing in the immediate vicinity, and suggesting that the London County Council Inspector should communicate with one of them when next he found cause of complaint, but no such communications have been received. Four complaints that chimneys other than those of private houses were emitting black smoke were received. In three instances no verification could be obtained, but in the remaining case the complaint was well founded, and abated on the service of notice. In another instance, high buildings erected next a dwelling house had such an effect on the action of its chimneys that whenever fires were lighted the rooms were filled with smoke, and the occupiers' health affected to such an extent that complaint was lodged with the Council. Notice served on the builder resulted in the chimneys being; carried up to a proper height, and the nuisance abated. Two occupiers of top rooms in tenement houses alleged that the smoke coming from the chimneys of low back additions of neighbouring houses prevented them from opening their windows for the purpose of ventilation. THES ARE THE CHIMNEYS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT OF COMPLAINT. Investigation shewed that in both cases they had serious ground for complaint, and notices were served and proceedings taken in both instances, which resulted in an abatement order being obtained in regard to one; but at the hearing of the other summons the owner raised the defence that the chimneys had been constructed in accordance with the requirements of section 20 of the Metropolis Building Act, 1855, maintained in a proper condition, and reasonably used; and further, that the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in dealing with smoke nuisances, had especially exempted the chimneys of private houses. The Magistrate declined to dismiss the summons on the facts of the case, but did so on the points of law mentioned above. Reference to the photograph will shew how serious from a public health point of view this state of things is, and as a large number of houses now occupied as tenements are affected, it appears to me that the attention of the London County Council should be specially drawn to the matter, with a view to obtaining such an amendment of the law as would bring this class of nuisance within the operation of section 2 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Frognal Mansions, Caretaker's Quarters. During an inspection of these Mansions it was found that the provision of scullery, lavatory, and watercloset in the Caretaker's Quarters consisted of an apartment 10 feet long by 9½ feet wide; along one side of which were shelves for the storage of food, whilst in one corner was a sink with water tap over, and in another was a watercloset apparatus without an enclosing partition of any kind. These conditions were rendered more unsatisfactory by the fact that this general apartment had no door separating it from the passage leading to it. Upon these facts being reported to the Public Health Committee, an Order was made requiring the owner to enclose the watercloset apparatus with a solid partition, and thus form a proper and separate apartment. This Order was not complied with, and proceedings were taken against the owner, resulting in him being fined £2 and 10s. 6d. costs, at the Hampstead Petty Sessions. Against this conviction he appealed to Clerkenwell Sessions, where the Judgment of the Justices was confirmed with costs. Certificates as to Water Supply. During the year 320 Certificates have been issued under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as compared with 286 in 1903. Drainage (Plan) Bye-laws. In my last Annual Report I commented upon the requirements of these Bye-laws. It is satisfactory to record that with very few exceptions there has been no difficulty in obtaining the required particulars. A considerable amount of additional work has been entailed in the examination and checking of these plans and specifications, and in communicating with the persons depositing them; but there can be no doubt that their value as records is well worth the trouble involved. During the year 680 notices of alteration or addition to, or the reconstruction of, drains or sanitary fittings in existing houses have been received, 545 of them being for such work as necessitated the deposit of drawings, and written particulars. Of the latter, 409 were cases of urgency in which the work could not be delayed but had to be proceeded with at once, notice being given oil the prescribed "Urgency" form, and the required plans and particulars being sent in at a later date. Condition of Sewers. Complaints.—During the year 94 complaints of the nuisance arising from the offensive emanations from sewer ventilators have been received be me, involving 55 streets; and these have been duly reported to the Public Health Committee; and also to the Borough Engineer. Ventilation by Shafts. —Pursuant to the resolution of the Council, "That in all cases of complaint of bad smells arising from open grids in the roadway, tall ventilating shafts be erected wherever practicable and necessary, there have been erected the following:— Brick shaft in Cemetery, Fortune Green. 8 in. by 4 in. rectangular shaft against No. 32, Compayne Gardens. 40 ft. steel column, Agamemnon Road. 30 ft. steel column,Gondar Gardens. Observation will be kept, and the matter further dealt with in my next Annual Report. Conference on the Administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. On the invitation of the London County Council, the Council on the 9th June appointed the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Mr. Councillor Hendrick), and Mr. Councillor Nunn, together with the Town Clerk and the Medical Officer of Health, to attend this Conference. The representatives met at the County Hall on the 7th and 18th July, and proceeded to consider the administration of the Act. The scope of the discussions were fairly comprehensive, as the following list of subjects of resolutions adopted will show: — Housing.—Houses let in Lodgings. Underground Rooms. Water Supply. Factories and Workshops. Shops. Food.—Premises where food is prepared for Sale. Abolition of private Slaughterhouses. Inspection of Meat killed in private Slaughterhouses. Inspection of Slaughterhouses, Cowhouses, Dairies,Milkshops, and Milkstores. Registration of Milkshops, Sale of Milk. Municipal Milk Depots. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Cisterns. Pretention of Disease.-Disinfection,'and provision of Laundry. Provision of permanent Shelter accommodation. Precautionary Measures against Phthisis, and Hospital Accommodation for this disease. Offensive trades. House refuse. Collection of fish offal and other offensive trade refuse. Sanitary Infection Miscellaneous.—Municipal Crèches. Smoke Nuisances. Metropolitan Ambulance Service. Application of Acts to Government Property. On the 17th November, the Council, on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, resolved that the Loudon County Council be informed that they generally approve of the resolutions adopted. Staff of the Public Health Department. No change has taken place in the personnel of the Department during the year. Temporary Offices. The lack of adequate accommodation for the Council's Staff at the Town Hall having been under consideration for some time, it was decided to transfer the Public Health and Borough Accountant's Departments to No. 7, Belsize Park Gardens. This removal took place on the 4th November. Dangerous Structures. During the year I reported to the Superintending Architect of the London County Council, or to the District Surveyor, 25 cases, in which dangerous structures, contraventions of the London Building Act, &v., have come under my notice. Public Mortuary. During the year the bodies of 82 persons were brought to the Mortuary as against 74 last year—51 by order of the Coroner, 20 by the Police, 10 at the request of friends of the deceased persons, and 1 under a Magistrate's Order. In 71 instances, or 86 per cent. of the bodies admitted, inquests were held, and in 44 instances, or 53 per cent., post-mortem examinations were made. The following table indicates the causes of death of the persons whose bodies were received into the Mortuary:— Cause of Death. Number of Bodies received. Deaths from natural causes 45 Accidental deaths 22 Suicide 12 Neglect at birth 3 Total 82 In only one instance was the body of a person who had died from an infectious disease brought to the Mortuary.

Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 4 Edw. 7 chap. 29. By this Act, the Vaccination Act 1898 is continued in force for another year, until the end 1905. London County Council (General Powers) Act 1904. Part IV. of this Act gives to Metropolitan Borough Councils the power, upon the certificate of their Medical Officer of Health, to disinfect, purify, or destroy, filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles in any house within their district, when the same is necessary to prevent health being affected or endangered, or prevent risk of, or check, infectious disease; and to require the Owner of any house or part of house which is infested with vermin, to remove the paper from the walls and to take such other steps as the case may require. Notice may now be served upon the Owner of any sanitary convenience erected in or accessible from any street, requiring him to remove or reconstruct any such convenience if it is either a nuisance or offensive to public decency. Where a movable sanitary dustbin has been provided for the storage of house refuse pursuant to or in conformity wit the requirements of any Bye-law, Order, or Statutory Authority, the Owner can be required to remove the fixed ashpit which previously did duty and to restore the site thereof to a good sanitary condition. Part V.—This part of the Act confers powers on the London County Council to cause cows suffering or suspected to be suffering from Tuberculosis of the Udder, in any dairyfarm or cowshed in the County, to be removed and slaughtered.
