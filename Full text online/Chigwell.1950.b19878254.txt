AC 4411 (3) LIBRARY CA 16 WEU CHIG 14 CHIGWELL URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH including the Report of the SENIOR SANITARY INSPECTOR for the Year ending DECEMBER 31st, 1950 Chigwell Urban District Council To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to you the Annual Report, including the report of the Senior Sanitary Inspector, for the year ending 31st December, 1950. In the statistical tables which follow, births and deaths have been corrected for "inward" and "outward" transfers, i.e. they refer only to persons who normally reside in the district, and they include all births and deaths among them wherever occurring. Infectious diseases, however, are allocated to the district in which they arise, irrespective of the place of normal residence of the patient. All rates and figures include members of the armed forces stationed in the area. The health of the population remained satisfactory and except for outbreaks of whooping cough and scarlet fever of moderate severity, there were no epidemics. Measles and poliomyelitis were considerably less prevalent than in the previous year. There were only two deaths from infectious diseases other than tuberculosis (meningitis 1, whooping cough 1.) It was particularly pleasing to note that despite the "polio scare," the number of children immunised against diphtheria did not fall, and once again no cases of this disease occured in the District throughout the year. It was possible to effect a marked increase in the number of reinforcing injections to 5 year olds by personal propaganda to the parents during 1 routine school medical inspection of entrants, followed by immunisation sessions held at the schools attended. If the District is to remain free from diphtheria, however, it is essential that there should be no abatement of immunisation, particularly of infants between 6 and 12 months old. There was no significant change in the birth rate or death rate. Births exceeded deaths by 515, but the population of the District increased from 40,940 to 48,680 (Registrar General's mid-year figures) chiefly owing to continued immigration into the L.C.C. Housing Estates. 1357 new houses were erected and occupied on these estates during the year, and as in the past, many of the houses were allocated on medical grounds, of which tuberculosis, asthma and heart disease were the most frequent. The problem of providing adequate health services to meet the rapid growth of the L.C.C. estates has been great. The residents on the estates have been accustomed to well equipped modern clinics within easy reach of their homes, and have made heavy demands on the services which are being provided by the County Council in existing buildings and improvised houses until permanent Combined Treatment Centres can be erected. (At time of writing, the Centre on the Hainault Estate is already functioning and that for the Loughton Estate is in course of erection). There have also been insistent demands for provision of Day Nurseries and Home Helps, which have not so far been adequately met because of transport and accomodation difficulties and the lack of available persons living on the estates who are suitable for this type of employment. Despite all these problems and difficulties (which are not surprising in such rapidly growing communities with a high proportion of medical priority cases) there is definite evidence of improving health, physique and well being— especially amongst the children. 2 National Assistance Act, 1948. Seven cases were referred for possible action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Five of these were kept under observation and the remaining two were admitted to institutions as voluntary cases by arrangement with the Welfare Department of the Essex County Council. It was thus possible to avoid compulsory action under the above Act in all cases. The Hygienic Food Traders Guild, operated in conjunction with the Waltham Holy Cross Urban District Council, has continued to advise the Councils, the traders and the public alike, on the need for improved standards of food handling. New codes of practice for vehicle ice cream Vendors and Licensed Public Houses were prepared and distributed and a film show on Rat Infestation and Food Poisoning was arranged in the Lopping Hall, and was attended by many traders, canteen workers and members of the public. Membership increased during the year from 35 to 47, and it is hoped that as many people as possible will visit the ambitious and attractive exhibition which the Guild has planned to take place in the Lopping Hall October 22nd —25th (inclusive) 1951. During the year the Council adopted model Bye-Laws issued by the Ministry of Food on the Clean Preparation, Handling and Distribution of Food. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Public Health Department for their help and co-operation during the year. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

(i) Water. The water supply for almost the whole district is derived from the Metropolitan Water Board. There is one house where the supply is obtained from a well. The supply to the area has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. All but one of the houses in the district have a piped water supply and it has not been found necessary to take samples for bacteriological examination, to test plumbosolvency or contamination. Houses supplied from standpipes Nil Houses supplied from wells 1 Two samples were obtained from the well referred to above for chemical and bacteriological analysis. The results were satisfactory in both cases. A sample was also obtained from a London County Council house on the Hainault Estate at Chigwell. The report received from the Laboratory was satisfactory. (ii) Drainage and Sewerage. Sanction to proceed with the reconstruction of the main works at Luxborough was received and the contractors commenced operations in the latter part of the year. The contract is likely to need eighteen months to two years to complete, especially in view of increasingly long delivery periods for essential materials and plant. In the meantime, the works have been functioning reasonably well under overload conditions and the standard of effluent has in the circumstances been fairly well maintained. The reconstruction of Millers Lane Works was completed during the year and a satisfactory effluent is now being produced. 13 The five pumping plants have given satisfactory service throughout the year. 2. Rivers and Streams. The River Roding is the only one passing through the centre of the district, dividing the wards of Chigwell on the south-east side and Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area which is under the jurisdiction of the Roding Catchment Board. 3. (i) Closet Accommodation and Cesspools. A block of six houses and two semi-detached houses previously served by cesspools were connected to the main sewerage system during the year. Properties still served by earth and Elsan closets and cesspools are in areas where no sewer is available. As development takes place every opportunity is taken to arrange for premises which are not at present connected to a sewer, to be so connected. (ii) Public Cleansing. Collection of house refuse has continued to be carried out once weekly throughout the district, by the Council's own covered vehicles. Another lorry has been added to cope with the increased number of premises and the fleet engaged on this service now comprises five 10/12 cub. yd. 'Fordson' lorries with 'Eagle' bodies, with a 7 cub. yd. similar vehicle in part time use for schools and other special collections. Trade refuse has been collected on a scale of charges as in previous years and the number of traders utilising this service has further increased. Refuse disposal has been by controlled tipping at a tip rented from a local contractor. Measures were again taken against fly and vermin infestation, and were increased during the hot weather. 14 Salvage recovery was continued at the tip by Council employees. Material recovered and disposed of as useful salvage during the year totalled 382 tons, including 370 tons of paper. Collection of Kitchen waste from street bins has also . been continued, and 305 tons were conveyed during the year to a concentration plant at Stapleford Abbotts. Road gullies (in streets maintained by the inhabitants at large) are emptied three times in each year and re-sealed with clean water. This is done by mechanical suction process under contract. (iii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area. An outline of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is given below:— Complaints received and dealt with 641 Inspections made 8,218 Nuisances abated 223 Informal Notices served 146 Informal Notices complied with 113 Statutory Notices served 44 S.atutory Notices complied with 43 Legal Proceedings 4 Summary of Nuisances.

Six houses were found to be verminous during this year. These houses were fumigated with "Fumite" and sprayed with "Zaldercide" or Cooper's Bed Bug Spray, with satisfactory results. Number of Inspections and visits: 67. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. 2,020 visits were made on rodent control. Treatment. "Cymag" gas, Red Squill, Arsenic, Zinc Phosphide and "Antu" poisons were used and traps were also employed. There is no serious infestation, but as the number of houses in the District increases so do the number of complaints received. There are large areas of open space such as farm and forest land. Baiting and poisoning of the Council's Sewers was carried out three times during the year with the following results. The latter, as shown below, being a test-bait only. Manholes baited 137 96 140 Prebait (part takes) 19 15 8 (complete takes) 40 31 15 Poison (part takes) 30 22 - „ (complete takes) 2 - - Dead rats picked up 2 - - The poison and bait bases used were as follows:— 1st Treatment.

The Chigwell and Waltham Holy Cross Hygienic Food Traders Guild was formed in 1948. An Advisory Committee was set up and has formulated the policy of the Guild. Codes of Practice were drawn up for each type of trade including Licensed Premises and Mobile Ice Cream Vendors. The Advisory Committee meets six times a year to receive reports from the Sanitary Inspectors concerning applications for membership and to discuss new problems and suggestions. The Committee is comprised as follows:— 22 Councillors 4 Food Traders 9 Trade Union 1 Employees 1 Technical Officers: Medical Officer of Health 1 Sanitary Inspectors 2 47 Food Traders have applied and been admitted to membership. The Certificate of Membership and employee badges have been issued in each case. The members represent the following trades:— Grocers and Provision Merchants 11 Fishmongers 3 Butchers 11 Confectioners 4 Bakers 2 Restaurants 3 Greengrocers 16 General Stores 3 Dairies 3 Licensed Premises 1 Arrangements are being made for a Clean Food Exhibition to be held at the Lopping Hall, Loughton, 22nd—25th October, 1951, inclusive. (c) Factories. 223 inspections have been made. Complaints regarding cellulose spraying plants have not been so numerous. The premises concerned are regularly visited and the managements show a willingness to reduce smells to a minimum. As regards stove enamel paint spraying, a triple booth wash plant has been installed in one factory with good results. Inspections have been carried out of factory premises in connection with means of escape in case of fire. We have been assisted by Officers of the Essex County Fire Brigade (Fire Prevention Branch), and a technical representative from the Engineer and Surveyor's Department of this Authority. I again wish to record my thanks for their assistance and cooperation during these important inspections. Twelve certificates have been issued by this Authority certifying that in each case the means of escape in case of fire have been adequate. 23 24 Factories Act, 1937. 1.
