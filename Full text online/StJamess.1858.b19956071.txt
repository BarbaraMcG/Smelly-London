JOHN CLEMENTS, General Report of Works executed by the Vestry of St. Jamess, Westminster, in the Year 1858-59. 8th June, 1859. Gentlemen, The List of Works executed by you which I have to submit for the past year is not a very long one, and no doubt will decrease annually as sewerage and other works are gradually brought to completion. The most important Work performed during the year is the remaking the carriageway in Regent Street and laying down iron channels for the same; as the principles followed in this work have been fully explained in a Report from the Committee appointed to carry it out, it does not appear necessary for me to go into the subject again here, and I have therefore contented myself with reporting the total expenditure. The carriageway in St. James's Square was repaired with a portion of the stone forming the previously existing paved margin in Regent Street, after it had furnished employment for the X stone breakers in the yard: other part of the same stone has been usefully employed in re-paving Mason's Yard, Duke Street, in slight repairs, and we still have a considerable quantity left, stored in the yard, I should say enough, or more, to last us during the present year in repairing or relaying paved carriageways; at the present time, taking the whole of the streets into consideration, I think there is every reason to be satisfied with their condition, especially the Macadamized portions, which will probably require but slight repairs till winter. The horse and cart purchased and maintained by you are and have been extremely useful in preventing delays to men at work by keeping them constantly supplied with all the necessary materials. It will be seen from the List of Sewerage Works that two new Sewers have been built, one in Peter Street and one in Noel Street, both of which were previously not only in a most dilapidated condition, but did not answer their purpose in carrying away the deposit in them; this was also the case with the Sewers in Old Burlington Street and Cork Street, to remedy which new inverts or curved bottoms have been built and the falls improved, whereby all their contents either find their own way or are easily swept out. It was intended last year to form a number of ventilating shafts in Sewers of small calibre, but upon examination and experiment it has been xi proved that inasmuch as an egg shaped Sewer 3 feet X 2 feet is too small for a man to work in, though he can crawl through it, it would be almost useless to go to the expense of forming air shafts for the purpose of enabling him to work, which is their principal intention. One ventilating grating has been fixed in Piccadilly, where from a peculiar combination of circumstances men constantly wanted to pass, and all foul gases congregated, being the highest point in the vicinity. Where gullies have been complained of I have had them trapped, and a regular system of cleansing and examination of all local Sewers that admit of it has been practised. At the time of constructing new Sewers it not unfrequently happens when they are "driven" or tunnelled, that existing drains are overlooked or some mistake is made in connecting them; I have found one or two cases of this kind and have therefore been obliged to have such defects remedied; they were not in the Sewers recently constructed by the Vestry but those previously made. Perhaps also in the vexed question of public Urinals as much has been done as could be, considering the few sites that there are available in this Parish for the purpose; one half of the Urinal originally fixed in the Haymarket has been reerected in Wells Street, Jermyn Street, and has been very useful, a small one to hold two persons xii has also been built in a court leading from the Haymarket to Market Street, in the hope that it would mitigate the fearful nuisances committed there after dark, and to a great extent it has accomplished this purpose; three others, in Blenheim Street, Marlborough Row, and Great Pulteney Street, have had cisterns made and water supplied to facilitate cleansing, for which purpose men arc constantly employed, and I think you may congratulate yourselves on the state of your local Sewerage, which I believe to be now in as good condition and as perfect as any in the Metropolis, and allowing for accidents, which may happen in some of the older portions, will probably be maintained at a comparatively small cost for many years. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, A. P. HOWELL, Surveyor.

TO THE VESTRY of The parish of St. James, Westminster. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, In laying before you my Third Annual Report, I have divided it into two heads:— I.—On the Death Rate and prevailing Diseases of the parish in the year 1858. II.—On the Sanitary work done in the parish in the year 1858. I.—ON THE DEATH RATE AND PREVAILING DISEASES IN THE YEAR 1858. I have this year, as I have done in my two previous Reports, drawn up four Tables*, in which you will find the causes of death in each division of the parish and the Workhouse recorded. From these Tables may be learned not only the actual cause of the mortality in the parish for the entire year, but the quarter of the year in which particular diseases have been prevalent, and the district of the parish in which they have occurred. *See Appendix. 4 On adding together the death of the four quarters of the year, it will be found that the number is 666, which must be regarded as a highly favourable result. The death in your parish in the years 1857 and 1856 and previously, will be seen by the following Table:— Average death for 10 years previous to 1856, 775 Death in the year 1856, 682 Ditto „ 1857, 712 Ditto „ 1858, 666 The death-rate of last year is thus found to be 109 below the average of the ten years previous to 1856, and is 18 below the average of the last three years. Adding the three years since your sanitary operations commenced, to the previous ten years, the mortality of 1858 presents us with 100 deaths less than the average. It may be thought premature to claim this large amount of saving of life as due to the sanitary agencies you have put in force, and were it a solitary case, further evidence might be demanded ; but as this result is the uniform sequence of welldirected measures of sanitary reform, there can be no doubt that you are justified in attributing this large diminution of your annual mortality to the sanitary organization which the Metropolis Management Act of 1855 was enacted to institute, and which has since been brought into play. 5 In a previous Report I have endeavoured to shew that where one death is prevented, there you have prevented at least ten cases of disease. I have also calculated, that the average value of a human being in England is, taking the young with the old and the rich with the poor, at least £.100. Thus, if we calculate the money worth of the life saved in our parish during the year 1858, it will be found to represent a sum of not less than £.10,000; whilst, if we calculated the cost of each illness prevented at the sum of £.5, we shall find that a further sum of £.5,000 has been saved. The whole sum saved, then, to the parish, is £.15,000. I know this sum does not appear as gained or lost in the yearly parochial accounts, but it is nevertheless as easily proved as though the loss of each life fell upon the poor-rates, and the cost of each illness was defrayed from the same fund. Every one knows the cost of disease and death in their own family, although it does not occur to every one to calculate how much he has saved by the draining of his own or his neighbour's house, the trapping of the neighbouring sewer, the closing of the poisoned pump, or the destruction of the adjacent fever-nests. Still, these are matters, I repeat, which can be accounted for in hard cash, and there is no more truthful position than that health is wealth. When the whole public of England is alive to this great fact, they will look back with perfect astonishment at the apathy and indifference with which, in past times, they have 6 regarded the causes of so vast an amount ot misery, poverty, and death, and wonder that so little was done for their removal. I now present you with a table which will shew the districts in which the death in 1858 has occurred, as well as the number of deaths, and affords a comparison between the deaths of 1856, '57, and '58. Name of District. Population in 1857. Acres in each Division. Persons to an Acre. Deaths in the Year 1858. 1857. 1856. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total. Total. Total.

It will also be seen that the death in 1858 has been precisely the same in the Berwick Street division as in 1857, greater in the Workhouse, 9 less in the St. James's Square division, and 50 less in the Golden Square division than in that year. The greatest improvement took place in the third *The number of persons in the Workhouse during 1848, was less than usual on account of the alterations going on in the building. I have ascertained from the Master of the Workhouse that 170 persons have thus been temporarily removed, and that amongst them four deaths have occurred. 7 and fourth, the summer and autumn quarters of the year; the first and second, the winter and spring: quarters, were higher than the average. The following Table gives the quarterly deaths for the last three years:— 1856. 1857. 1858. First Quarter 178 182 200 Second Quarter 163 166 171 Third Quarter 1751 182 133 Fourth Quarter 169 185 162 682 715 666 Passing on from these general facts, let me now call your attention to the features of the special diseases for the year. The group of diseases which are called "zymotic" are those which appear most under the control of sanitary regulations. It should, however, be always recollected that one of the greatest barriers to the practical efficiency of sanitary arrangement is the ignorance and carelessness of the public. This is especially seen in the case of zymotic diseases, where personal cleanliness, and the separation of infected persons from the rest of the family are absolutely necessary to prevent the spread of disease. Instead of this, it is frequently seen that, where these diseases occur, little or no attention is paid to their infectious character, and an unscrupulous intercourse is carried on between the members of infected families, not only amongst themselves, but amongst their neighbours. 8 and thus these diseases arc propagated in spite of every warning and precaution. The following Tables shew the number of deaths from the most common forms of zymotic disease during the last four years:— 1855. Names of Diseases. St. James's Square. Golden Square. Berwlok Street.

There can be no doubt that zymotic diseases affect those most severely who are exposed to the devitalizing action of impure air, and other defective sanitary arrangements. The prevailing forms of zymotic disease has varied in each year. Thus in 1855 and 1856 the most fatal disease was hooping cough; in 1857 it was diarrhœa; and in 1858 it was scarlet fever. This latter disease, although most prevalent in the Berwick Street division of the parish, carried off 9 persons in the Golden Square district, and 12 in the St. James's Square district, thus shewing that it is not merely overcrowding that invites the attacks of this disease. In reference to the occurrence of this disease amongst the more wealthy and better housed inhabitants of the parish, I made the following remarks in my Report presented to Vestry on the 2nd of June, 1858:— "Such cases indicate that the utmost care on "the part of individuals is insufficient to prevent "the attacks of these diseases, whilst the sur"rounding population is careless or exposed to "the causes which propagate and maintain them. "The way in which contagious diseases may be "introduced into families where sanitary arrange"ments are more or less complete are three; 10 "1.—By the exposure of diseased person or "persons who have been in contact with them in "the public streets and ways. 2.—By the practice "of conveying such persons in cabs or other public "conveyances, by which the vehicle itself is ren"dered a source of poison; and, 3.—The effluvia "emitted from the common sewers into the streets. "With regard to the first source of the disease, "nothing more can be done than to instruct "people on the danger and guilt of such exposure. "It is a common practice for persons in whose "families contagious diseases arc prevailing to "attend places of worship or amusement, and send "their children to school. To the latter source I "traced the cases of scarlet fever in Marl"borough Mews. The second cause is one that "demands the interference of Government. In all "large towns conveyances ought to be kept es"pecially for persons affected with contagious "diseases, and heavy penalties ought to be in"flicted on those who convey or cause to be "conveyed such persons in ordinary conveyances "plying for hire. With regard to the third cause "it lies entirely in the hands of the Metropolitan "Board of Works. I have many times called your "attention to the necessity of ventilating the com"mon sewers. Till this is done a great part of our "sanitary activity is paralysed. It is useless to get "rid of poisons from the population in our houses, "if we throw it into our streets. The child wend- 11 "ing its way to the parks, the merchant returning "to his suburban residence, or the affluent riding "in his carriage may be stricken with disease and "death by the invisible agents of destruction steal"ing from every shaft and gully-hole of our system "of sewers. It would, I believe, be better for "these conduits of our house refuse to be entirely "open to the air, than that they should be allowed "to blow off at regular intervals as they do now, "a current of concentrated poison. To my mind, "the Metropolitan Board of Works is incurring a "fearful responsibility in neglecting the repeated "warnings it has received on this important part "of the sanitary arrangements of the Metropolis, "placed under their control." In the occurrence of scarlet fever in this part of London we have not been peculiar, as this disease carried off within the bills of mortality of London 4,118 persons. This is at the rate of one death to every 590 persons of the living population. We have, however, every reason to be thankful that the scourge has fallen upon us more lightly, as but one in every 1,200 of our population have fallen victims to this disease. With regard to all forms of zymotic disease, our parish this year contrasts equally favourably with the rest of London. Whilst in the parish of St. James, Westminster, the mortality from small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, hooping cough, diarrhœa, and typhus, was but one 12 in every 520 of the population, the mortality from these diseases in all London was one in 176. Thus, if the death in St. James's from all these diseases had been the same as the death in all London, then we should have lost 207 lives instead of 70. If all London had only lost in proportion to its population, the same number of lives in proportion to its population as the parish of St. James's, Westminster, then, instead of 13,443 deaths from these diseases, there would have been but 4,544. In other words, had there been as little zymotic disease in all London, in proportion to its population, in 1858, as there was in the parish of St. James, Westminster, 8,899 lives would have been saved. I have before spoken of the money value of life, and I must leave you to calculate the stupendous prodigality of the present sanitary arrangements of the Metropolis. The parish of St. James, Westminster, is by no means so healthy as it might be, or as I hope it will be ; but you will see by this comparison with the rest of London, what is the real object of sanitary legislation, and what a vast blessing waits upon the efforts of those who are seeking to prevent the origin and extension of disease. Accompanying scarlet fever, and in its epidemic character resembling that disease, there has prevailed in this country, for the last two years, a contagious disease, affecting the mouth, throat, and air passages, called first, in France, diphtherite, and 13 in this country diphtheria. This disease, which in some parts of the country has committed great ravages, prevailed to a considerable extent in London in 1858. In this parish only five fatal cases were recorded in that year. Although in these particular cases no unusual deficiency of sanitary arrangements could be detected, there can be no question that this disease is one that has originated in conditions of the system brought on by the presence of impurities in the atmosphere, arising from deficient drainage, and the consequent presence of animal and vegetable matter in a state of decay. Once developed, the disease spreads rapidly by contagion or infection, especially amongst families and populations where sanitary regulations have been long neglected. It is to be hoped that the attention which now, for three years, has been given to the sanitary condition of your parish, has been a check to the progress of this disease, and that it will not present more formidable features in future than it has done in the course of the year 1858. Turning from the zymotic group of diseases, and glancing over the other causes of death which present us with the highest number, we find standing out very prominently amongst diseases of the lungs, phthisis, ox pulmonary consumption. The following Table will enable you to compare the deaths from this disease in the three last years:— 14 1858. Deaths from Phthisis. St. James's Sq. Division. Golden Square Division. Workhouse. Berwick Street Division. Total. Total 1857. Total 1856. 1st Quarter, 4 4 11 10 29 18 29 2nd Quarter, 5 1 5 10 21 26 23 3rd Quarter, 3 9 6 3 21 21 32 4th Quarter, 4 7 9 8 28 22 26 16 21 31 31 99 87 110 In 1857 the death was a little less, and in 1856 a little more than in 1858, so that we may fairly take 100 as about the annual death in the parish from phthisis alone. The following Table shews the mortality for the last three years for each quarter and each division of the parish:— 1856. Quarters. St. James's Sq. Div. Golden Sq. Division. Workhouse Berwick St. Division. Total. 1st Quarter, 7 17 5 29 2nd Quarter, 3 9 11 23 3rd Quarter, 4 17 11 32 4th Quarter, 5 13 8 26 Total, 19 56 35 110 1857. 1st Quarter, 3 5 6 4 18 2nd Quarter, 7 6 7 6 26 3rd Quarter, 6 6 6 3 21 4th Quarter, 3 8 8 3 22 Total, 19 25 27 16 87 1858. 1st Quarter, 4 4 11 10 29 2nd Quarter, 5 1 5 10 21 3rd Quarter, 3 9 6 3 21 4th Quarter, 4 7 9 8 28 Total, 16 21 31 31 99 15 The death from phthisis, on the average in the parish, is 1 in every 360 of the population. This is favourable as contrasted with the whole population of London, the death from phthisis in which is 1 in every 324 of the population. But the death in our parish is not the same over the three districts into which the RegistrarGeneral's Returns are divided. If we take the death in the Workhouse, and equally divide it between the three districts of the parish, and then compare it with the population, we shall find that phthisis occurs very unequally. Thus, in the St. James's Square division only one person in 426 of the population died; in the Golden Square division 1 in 422; but in the Berwick Street division 1 in every 327 of the population, so that the death from phthisis is nearly one-fourth greater in the last than the other two divisions. This leads us at once to the question as to whether there is any absolute necessity that a fourth more people should die of consumption in one division of the parish more than another? We must answer, of course, that there is none. It then becomes our duty to seek out for the causes which destroy so large a number of our population every year, and in seeking for the cause of the excess of death from phthisis in the Berwick Street division, we shall be helped to discover generally the cause of this disease which produces the death of a seventh of those who die annually in the parish. Without quoting authori- 16 tics, then, I may say that all medical writers are agreed that impure air, from want of ventilation, is the most potent of all the causes of consumption. If we look to the death rate from phthisis in various parts of England, we shall find that " in "proportion as the male and female populations "are severally attracted to indoor branches of "industry, in such proportion, the things being "equal, their respective death-rates by phthisis are "increased*." It may be further stated that, just in proportion to the crowding together in rooms, houses, shops, workshops, or manufactories of such a population will be the death from phthisis. Now, if we turn to the Table at page 6 it will be seen that whilst 134 persons only live on an acre of ground in the St. James's Square division of your parish, there are 262 in the Golden Square division, and the large number of 432 on an acre in the Berwick Street division. It cannot therefore, I think, be doubted that it is the overcrowding and want of ventilation in this latter division of the parish that produces the tendency to an increased amount of death from phthisis. But this presence of impure air and want of ventilation acts throughout the parish, and I would especially call attention to the large population in St. James's who are confined in shops, and on whom *Series of Papers relating to the Sanitary State of the People of England.—London: 1858. 17 a want of ventilation must be constantly acting as a cause of consumption. It is probable that a large number of those who thus suffer leave their situations in the parish and die away from London. The amount of this mortality is not in any way indicated by the Registrar's Return. I would especially call attention to one great source of contamination of the atmosphere in the dwelling houses and shops of this parish, and that is the extensive employment of gas. One gas-light, as ordinarily burned, consumes as much air as six persons, and where gas is burned more than ordinary care should be taken to secure the proper ventilation of rooms in which it is consumed. From some experiments made in conjunction with Dr. Letheby, we found that the quantity of carbonic acid gas in a room over a shop in this parish, that it contained three times as much carbonic acid as Dr. Letheby had found in the most densely populated court in the City of London. Such a fact as this, shews that by the use of gas without sufficient ventilation, the houses of the most opulent may be reduced by neglect to the condition of the most thickly populated courts of the metropolis. It is very certain that where gas is extensively burned, unless every precaution is taken to get rid of the products of combustion, the health of those exposed to its influence must suffer, and there is every reason to believe that the most constant and fatal form which this suffering assumes is that of consumption. b 18 Under these circumstances, I think it my duty to urge upon all those who employ young persons in shops, work rooms, or factories, the necessity of ventilating properly such rooms, and diminishing as far as possible the number of hours in which young persons are employed, exposed to the contaminating influence of gas light. For this reason, I cordially concur in those public movements which have for their object the diminution of the hours in which young people are confined in shops, and the reduction of the hours of labour to which young females are exposed in dress making and millinery establishments. The next class of diseases to which I would call attention, and which are closely connected with the last, are diseases of the lungs, more especially the group comprehended under bronchitis, pleurisv, and pneumonia. The following Table shews the death from these diseases in 1858, in each quarter in each division of the parish, and the age of those attacked:— Diseases of the Lungs in 1858. St. James's Square. Golden Sq. Workhouse. Berwick St. Under 1 Year. Under 5 Years. Above 5 Years. Total. 1 st Quarter, 15 25 7 23 12 7 51 70 2nd Quarter, 5 4 2 15 11 6 9 26 3rd Quarter, 1 6 5 1 .. .. 13 13 4th Quarter, 8 11 4 19 10 9 23 42 29 46 18 58 33 22 96 151 19 If we suppose that the death in the workhouse is equally due to the three divisions of the parish, then we find the most thickly populated district suffering the same disparity as in the case of phthisis. Thus, in the Berwick Street district, the death from diseases of the lungs was one in 169 of the population, in the Golden Square district one in 241, and in St. James's Square district one in 392. Of these deaths, as you see by the above Table, onethird took place in children under five years of age. Although so large a proportion of those deaths occur during the autumn and winter quarters, and are attributable to the direct agency of cold, it is very obvious that the Berwick Street district is not colder than the other parts of the parish, and that we must look to the operation of other causes for the explanation of the greater mortality of that district from these diseases. I believe these causes will be found in the crowded character of that population. Where there is crowding there is defective ventilation, and impure air. Where the air is impure, the changes necessary to the health of the body do not go on, and that debility is produced, which results in those congestions of the lungs, brought on by exposure to cold, which end in disease and death. Unfortunately for the health of the community, people only look at the last link in this chain of causes, and frequently maintain the warmth of their houses at the expense of excluding the fresh air, by which alone the predisposition to disease can be prevented. 20 The mortality amongst children was reduced in 1858, as shewn in the following Table:— 1857. Deaths under 1 Year. Deaths under 5 Years. Total. 1st Quarter, 58 31 81 2nd Quarter, 52 28 80 3rd Quarter 73 32 105 4th Quarter, 50 23 73 225 114 339 1858. 1st Quarter, 45 24 69 2nd Quarter, 55 37 92 3rd Quarter, 44 16 60 4th Quarter, 35 26 61 179 163 282 These tables are interesting, as shewing that a large proportion of the life saved during the past year was infant life. They shew that 57 less children died in 1858 than in 1857; and moreover, that of these, 46 were above one year old. They also shew, in comparison with the whole mortality of the parish, that the relative mortality of child death to that of adult death was less in 1858 than in 1857; for in 1857, 376 persons died above 5 years of age, and in 1858, 384 died above that age. In order to shew the difference between the death of children in London, and the death of children in the country, 1 have made inquiries with regard to the mortality of the children at the parish school on 21 Wandsworth Common. I find that the average number of children in this school, since its opening in 1852, has been 150, and yet, marvellous to say, there has been but two deaths. The ages of these children is between 3 years and 15 years old, and if the mortality of the school had been equal to the mortality in the parish, instead of the deaths being 2, they would have been 14. If the deaths of the children between 3 and 15 in the parish had been no greater than the deaths in the Wandsworth school, instead of 900 deaths, there would have been but 130. I would call the attention of all those interested in the education of the young to these figures. There can be no doubt that the rearing of children in London is attended with an enormous loss of life, and not only a great loss of life, but a loss of health and strength which must always tell upon the population. Wherever schools can be removed into the country they ought, or those who maintain them in London should be prepared to shew what are the advantages which counterbalance this enormous loss of life. This question has been agitated with regard to the public schools of London, and I have the conviction that a fearful responsibility rests on those who, in spite of the evidence of the loss of health in children who live in London, oppose all plans for the removal of these schools to localities beyond the influence of those causes of death which are so numerous in the crowded parts of the metropolis. 22 In examining the weekly returns of death forwarded now through the Registrar-General, I have been struck with the large number of cases in which persons are found dead, or die without a medical attendant, and as I find on inquiry, this is the case in other parishes, I think it is a matter worthy of inquiry as to whether such cases undergo that examination which is necessary to determine whether any further investigation should take place. It appears to me that, in order to secure the ends of justice, that in such cases an inquiry ought to be instituted by a competent medical authority, which is not the case under the present system. II.—THE SANITARY WORK OF 1858. For a detail of the work done under the Sanitary Inspector, I must refer you to his Report, which is subjoined in the Appendix. By that Report you will see that nearly 1000 nuisances injurious to health have been detected, whilst upwards of 1600 nuisances previously existing, or detected during the year, have been either mitigated or removed. I would especially call your attention to the list of houses drained, or in which the drains have been repaired. A large number of these have occurred in the larger and better streets, and I would especially call the attention of the more opulent in the parish to the defective condition of the drains in their houses. It is not till the smell 23 becomes so offensive as not to be borne, or that disease is present in the house, or that one or more of the inhabitants have been snatched away bydeath, that the condition of these houses become known to the Sanitary Inspector, or is reported to myself. I would, therefore, again repeat what I said last year, that in all cases where brick drains have existed for seven or eight years, they ought to be examined whether they smell or not, in order to ascertain whether they are entire or not. It is not the gases which smell the most that are most injurious to health, and a broken drain or cesspool may be constantly pouring forth a deadly miasm that can only be detected by those accustomed to the investigation of such causes of disease. In connection with the deficient drainage of the % better class of houses, I would especially refer to their frequent deficient ventilation. The fear of a draught is alike the bane of the rich and poor. Windows are not only not opened, but they are not made to open; many windows have the topsash immoveable, the letting down of which is the only efficient way of ventilating the room at all. The water closets are frequently placed in positions where ventilation is next to impossible, and many of them even in good houses are disgustingly small, dark, and noisome. These are some of the causes which, amongst even the wealthier classes of society, produce directly attacks of disease, or by their constant action on the system 24 predispose it to succumb to the action of poisons from without. By reference to the Inspector's Report, you will see that certain establishments likely to become nuisances have been constantly visited by your Sanitary Inspector. Thus slaughter houses, cow houses, and mews have been regularly visited. During the year, the magistrates renewed the licence for slaughtering on their premises to 13 butchers, and refused the application of 10 others. In no case was any new licence to slaughter in dwelling houses granted. Licences have also altogether been refused in all cases where the slaughtering of animals was carried on under ground. It is to be hoped that these restrictions will lead, gradually, to the alteration of the practice of slaughtering in dwelling houses, or yards surrounded by houses, altogether. The following is a list of the cow houses and number of cows kept in the parish of St. James's:— Street. Number of Cows. 1. Marshall Street, 46 2. Pugh's Place, 19 3. New Street, 39 4. Hopkins Street, 20 5. Ham Yard, 20 6. William and Mary Yard, 12 7. Blenheim Mews, 34 8. Plough Yard, 15 205 25 These cow houses, though probably not more injurious to health than slaughter houses, are very great nuisances to the neighbourhood in which they are situated. Although a great deal has been done to prevent the nuisance arising from these places in the course of the last two or three years, the complaints with regard to them are constant. The St. James's Model Lodging House is permanently injured as a residence by its contiguity to the cow house in New Street. The nuisance of the cow house in Marshall Street is notorious throughout the whole parish; whatever may be done by the proprietor of this place, nothing can prevent the herding together of 25 or 30 cows in a room of a dwelling house, in a row of other houses, from being a nuisance to all who may have the misfortune to live near. It is the more to be regretted that these establishments are allowed to exist, as it does not appear that they are any accommodation to the public. Milk supplied by cows kept in the unnatural and artificial condition to which they are exposed in these sheds, cannot be so good as that which comes from the country, a due supply of which can now be obtained by the agency of the railways. The condition of the mews in the parish has been far from satisfactory, and, in conjunction with my colleagues, the Medical Officers of Health of the other parishes of London, I have for some time past been employed in collecting information with 26 regard to the condition of the mews in the parish, and the health of those who live in or near these establishments. During the year I have often had occasion to call your attention to the defective arrangements for carrying away the dust and other dry refuse from houses. Arising from the practice, by servants and others, of throwing all kinds of animal and vegetable matter into the dust-bin, decomposition of the matter, especially in summer, sets in, and the consequence is a most disgusting effluvia is emitted, which often becomes a source of disease. Such refuse ought not to decompose at all, it ought not to be allowed to remain long enough on the premises to do so, and if by neglect it becomes noxious, it ought to be removed at a time of the day when it is least likely to offend and injure those who are passing in the street. In making these remarks I wish to state, that I believe the removal of dust is not less attended to in St. James's than in any other parish of London, but I think the whole arrangement by which dust is removed in London is clumsy, dirty, and unhealthy. Dust should be removed from every house once in every two or three days; it should be removed before eight o'clock in the morning in the winter, and seven in the summer; it should be removed in covered carts, by skilful men, who should in no way be allowed bribes for the performance of their duty. I believe that all these 27 objects might be obtained were several parishes to unite together and act upon a common plan, and that it would cost less than the present inefficient, often offensive and unhealthy system. The cesspools filled up during the past year were sixty-four. Wherever cesspools have been found, they have been discovered as the result of discomfort, disease, or death. There is no doubt in my mind that the condition of the Thames in the summer of 1858, was brought on by the increased sanitary activity of the parishes of London during the two preceding years. Injurious as undoubtedly the state of the atmosphere was in the months of June and July, the gases producing this effect were less dangerous in the free air over the river than under the dwelling houses and near to the sleeping rooms of the inhabitants of London. As our sanitary action proceeds we may expect that each year will increase the effect of the sewage on the Thames: until something is done permanently to relieve the river of the burden of suspending, decomposing, and depositing a mass of animal and vegetable refuse, amounting to upwards of a thousand tons a day. No one can think on this subject without being reminded of the value of the matters that thus poison our houses and our rivers. Under Divine direction, this precious refuse was ordered to be applied to its natural purpose in the economy of nature by the old Jewish people. Acting in 28 accordance with this law, the hundreds of millions of China have no sanitary evil like this with which we have now to contend, and no one who looks to the laws which govern the life of animals and plants can believe that a system, which demands the destruction of so large an amount of material essential to the growth of the food of man, and at the expense of producing disease during that destruction, can long continue. It may be expedient to carry out the main drainage plan of the metropolis immediately; but the prevention of the permanent loss of the elements which constitute the refuse of our towns, is a problem fraught with too great interest to society ever to be given up. It seems impossible to recover these elements from the water with which they are mixed before passing into the sewers, and it does seem as if the time was come when the great question must be opened afresh, as to whether we have done right in the introduction of water for the removal of the human refuse in our houses. There can be no doubt that plans as cleanly, as free from objection, and as economical as this of water-removal might be introduced, and which would secure the utilisation of that which is now an entire loss, and which it is questionable whether, under any circumstances whatever, can be otherwise than a source of offence, disease, and death. Amongst the other sanitary operations of the year, I would especially allude to the improvements 29 that have been made in Burlington Arcade. The dead part of the ceiling of the roof have been removed, and glass frames, with spaces for ventilation at the bottom, supplied in their place. This has made the Arcade much lighter, and in consequence the inhabitants are not exposed for so many hours to the injurious atmosphere produced by the burning of a large quantity of gas. Permission has also been given by the Government to allow the ventilation to the backs of the houses on the east side through the dead wall facing the gardens of Burlington House. The large growth of vegetation which kept this wall continually moist, has also been removed. It is to be hoped that the inhabitants will not be slow to avail themselves of the opportunity for increased ventilation which the considerate permission of Her Majesty's First Commissioner of Works has given them. The proper ventilation of public buildings is a matter of great importance in a sanitary point of view, as there can be no doubt that the young and susceptible take great harm from long exposure in crowded and unventilated public rooms. I have examined the public places of meeting in this parish, and although they most of them have the means of ventilation, I am not able to say to how great an extent they may be employed. The ventilation of public rooms should be of a kind which, whilst it carries off impure air, admits fresh air without producing the impression of cold on 30 those who are in the room. All public rooms lighted with gas should be supplied with means for getting rid immediately of the products of combustion. Public rooms and places of worship are not often built with reference to these requirements, but I am glad to say that the new St. James's Hall which was opened in 1858, is so constructed as to secure a most satisfactory amount of ventilation, without inconvenience to the audience. Amongst other sanitary improvements going on in the parish, I may mention the building a new Police Court in Great Marlborough Street. The old premises were very deficient in sanitary arrangements, and the cells for the detention of prisoners small, inconvenient, and eminently insalubrious. The new offices have been built with every attention to the health and morality of its temporary inmates. In my last Annual Report, I drew your attention to the subject of the water supply of the parish. I was induced to do this in a somewhat detailed manner, on account of the erroneous opinions so generally held with regard to the nature and character of the water supplied for drinking purposes in London. The most dangerous of these opinions is that which regards the water obtained from the surface wells of this and other parishes as not only less impure than the water supplied from the river Thames, but as possessing highly salubrious and beneficial properties. It was not till the investigation that took place after the terrible catastrophe of 1854, when upwards of 500 inhabitants of this parish 31 were destroyed by the Broad Street pump, that I was made aware how largely the surface well waters of London are impregnated with sewage and other objectionable matters. It was then that I felt it to be a public duty to recommend you to close your pumps for drinking purposes, and obtained the sanction of thirty-four medical officers of health in the metropolis to that recommendation. The letters which I received from those gentlemen were published in my last Report, and after having been republished by the Vestry of Marylebone, they have formed the most convincing evidence of the necessity of a purer water supply in the streets of London, and have been extensively circulated in the publications of the Public Drinking Fountains Association. Although, after the adoption of my recommendation, you did not think it advisable to continue the closing the pumps, yet the fact of their contamination has become so generally known that comparatively little use is now made of them for drinking purposes. I have continued to make observations upon the surface well waters from time to time, and can report no amendment. Their impurity is habitual and constant, and I do not think that any means can be adopted for making them more pure. The fact is, the water supplied by the water companies at present is the purest, and if this is further submitted to a process of filtration before being supplied to the public, as is proposed by the Drinking Fountains Association, I do not think any harm can arise from the 32 ing such water. I have, however, already expressed to you my conviction that a water freer from injurious impurities than filtered Thames water may be obtained for drinking purposes in London, from the chalk beneath our feet, and that which forms the sides of the great basin of London. The Thames water is not pure, filtered, as it is by the present water companies, and as long as it is drunk at all it may be drunk in an impure condition, and become injurious to human health. In the pursuit of an object like that of the preservation of the life of society, we must recollect that the moral obligation is co-extensive with the law that "Thou shalt do no murder;" and, that we must not be satisfied with the conditions that kill only a few of the community, but seek for those that shall not kill at all. It is, I believe, under a sense of this obligation that you have endeavoured to carry out the sanitary welfare of this great parish, and I have, in conclusion, to offer you my sincere thanks for the support I have received during the past year, in carrying out the arduous and often thankless duties of the office which, through your confidence, I have the honour to hold. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. 8, Savile Row. APPENDIX, CONTAINING 1. Tables of Causes of Death. 2. Report of Sanitary Inspector's Work. 3.

JAMES H. MORGAN, Sanitary Inspector. 53 Sanitary Directions issued in 1858, by the Medical Officer of Health. The attention of the Parishioners is respectfully called to the following points connected with the Sanitary Arrangements of their Premises:— Dust-Bins and Ash-Pits.—These should never be allowed to smell. In order to avoid this, animal and vegetable refuse should not be thrown into them at all. All such matters should be Burned. The Dustmen employed by Mr. James Summersell, the Parish Contractor, are bound to remove the refuse from a Dust-Bin without fee or reward. In case of refusal, incivility, or extortion, the number of the Cart should be taken, and a complaint should be made at the Paving Office, Stone Yard, Dufour's Place, Broad Street, Golden Square. When the Dust-Bin smells offensively, it should be sprinkled with Chloride of Lime, or other deodorising liquid. House-Drains.—Whenever they smell offensively, they should be flushed, and all traps or valves connected with them should be examined, in order to ascertain if they are acting properly. Should the smell persist, the Drains should be examined, as they are either stopped or impaired, and the health of the household is endangered. Cesspools.—These receptacles frequently exist where they are not suspected, giving rise to offensive smells and 54 bud health. The Law regards them as "Nuisances "injurious to Health," and their immediate abolition is imperative on the Owner of the premises on which they are situated. Water.—Cisterns and Water-Butts should be cleaned out once a month. They should on no account be left uncovered. In the summer, it is a safe plan to boil or filter all water used for drinking. Water from Pumps with surface Wells is liable to contamination, and should be avoided for drinking purposes, especially in hot weather. Fresh Air.—When Fires are not in use, sitting-rooms, bed-rooms, and shops, should be ventilated, by letting down the top sash of the Window, by ventilating panes in the upper part of the Window, or by valves in the Chimnies. The majority of Windows do not open as they ought by sashes from the top, and a large number where top sashes do exist are not used, by which the proper ventilation of rooms is prevented, and a large amount of disease engendered. Persons having Complaints to make of Nuisances injurious to Health, should apply at the Vestry Offices, 14, Marshall Street, between the hours of 9 and 4 o'Clock, where a Book is kept for the Registry of Complaints, which will be attended to by the Medical Officer of Health, and Sanitary Inspector.
