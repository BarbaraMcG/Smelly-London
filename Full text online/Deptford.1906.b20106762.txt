To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the vital statistics and sanitary work for the Registration Year 190G, 52 weeks ending December 29th, 1906. POPULATION. The population of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was estimated at 115,495 at the middle of the year 1906. BIRTHS. During the 52 weeks ending the 29th December, 1906, 3,260 births (1,662 of males and 1,598 of females) were registered, compared with 3,290 in 1905, and 3,265 in 1904. The birth.rate in the Borough was equivalent to an annual rate of 28.22 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 28.73 for the two preceding years and with an average of 32.5 per 1,000 for past ten years. The birth.rate in London was 26.7 per 1,000, compared with 27.1 and 27.9 for the years 1905 and 1901 respectively, with an average of 28.9 per 1,000 for the past ten years. The birth.rate in England and Wales was 27.0 per 1,000, in the 76 great towns 27.9, and that in the 142 smaller towns 26.5 per 1,000. The subjoined table gives the number of births which occurre n each Ward, also the birth-rate in each Ward. (See also Table 10) Ward. Births. Birth Rate per 1,000. Males. Females. Total.

The illegitimate births numbered 56, which occurred in the several Wards as follows :— East Ward. North Ward. North.West South Ward. South.East South.West Ward. Ward. Ward. 17 7 17 3 4 8 MARRIAGES. The number of marriages registered during the year was 855, as compared with G57 during the previous year, 1905. The following table shows the number of marriages and the rate per 1.00 in the Borough of Deptford and London during the past ten years:— YEAR. DEPTFORD. Marriage Rate for London.

The number of deaths registered during the year was 1,918 (males 1023, and females 895). Of these 531 occurred in Public Institutions outside the borough, 68 occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South Eastern Hospital, of which 64 were non. parishioners, so that the actual number of deaths excluding non. parishioners is 1854, and upon these figures the statistics are based. The death-rate for the borough was equal to an annual rate of 16.0 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 14.3 for 1905, 16.0 for the year 1904, and 15.4 for 1903, per 1,000 persons living, with an average of 15.8 for the past 10 years. The number of deaths that occurred in the borough itself, of parishioners only, was 1,323, giving a death-rate of 11.4 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate in England and Wales was 15.4, in the 75 great towns was 15.9, in the 142 smaller towns 14.5, and in the County of London as a whole 15.1. The following table gives the number of deaths which occurred in each ward, and the death.rate in each ward (See also Tables 1, 2, 6, 7, 8):— Ward. Deaths. Death Rate per 1,000. Males. Females. Total. East Ward 266 203 469 20.8 North Ward 251 229 480 19.2 North West Ward 184 167 351 14.6 South Ward 75 98 173 13.9 South East Ward 109 72 181 14.8 South West Ward 105 95 200 13.8 (These death-rates are calculated on the census population of 1901.) Deaths of residents occurring in outlying public institutions are allocated to their respective wards according to the addresses of the deceased as received from the Registrar.General's Department. Table No. 11 gives a list of the institutions in which the deaths occurred. MORTALITY AT GROUP OF AGES. The 1,854 deaths recorded (of parishioners only) during the year included 748 children under five years of age. The deaths of 472 children occurred under one year, 276 under five years, 63 between five and fifteen, 69 between fifteen and twenty.five, 533 between the 4 ages of twenty-five and sixty-five, and 441 of parsons aged upwards of sixty-five. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 472, the rate of infantile mortality, that is to say the proportion of deaths of infants under one year of age to every 1,000 children born during the year was 144, compared with an average of 160 during the past ten years. The infantile mortality rate in London for the year was 130, and the average rate for the past ten years 151; in England and Wales the rate was 133 for the year, the average rate for the previous ten years being 150 per 1,000 births. By far the largest number of the deaths is due to disorders of digestion (diarrhoea and enteritis) respiratory diseases (bronchitis and pneumonia), atrophy, premature birth, and the ordinary infectious diseases, measles, whooping cough, etc. The deaths from diarrhoea alone numbered 119, as against 66 for the previous year; whooping cough 36, compared with 10 for the last year; measles 12 against 5 the year before. It will be seen from Table No. 5 that the number of infants who die in the first week after birth is much larger than the number who die in the second week after birth. So also the number who die in the second week is larger than the number who die during the third week, and so on in inverse proportion progressively. According to English law no cognisance is taken of the birth of a child before it is six weeks old, when civil registration has to take place; in Scotland the period is three weeks. The opinion expressed—by resolution - at the Conference on Infantile Mortality, was that all births should be notified to the Medical Officer of Health within 48 hours; and as I stated in my last year's report, the Town Hall should be the place for registration.

BIRTHS 3260 DEATHS (including 531 in Outlying Public Institutions) 1854 Excess of Births over Deaths 1406 The following resolutions were passed at a National Conference on Infantile Mortality, which was held at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, in June, 1906, under the presidency of the Rt. Hon. John Burns, M.P., President of the Local Government Board:— 1. That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in elementary Hygiene with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants, to their present scheme for systematically training girls of the senior classes in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and the elements of dietary. 2. That in the opinion of this Conference, immediate legislation is required enabling sanitary authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of pure, or modified, or sterilized milk, and to defray any cost out of the monies available for public health purposes. 3. That in view of the information submitted, the Conference is of opinion that all still births should be notified within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur, and that no burial should take place without a medical certificate. 4. That notification of all births should be given within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur. 5. That in the opinion of this Conference, the question of insurance of infant lives under 12 months is one demanding serious consideration, and, with the view of receiving reliable information, the Government should be asked to appoint a departmental committee of enquiry on the whole question. 6. (a) That the period of one month's abstention from factory work away from home now imposed on mothers, be extended to at least three months, and that, on their return to work, evidence must be produced, satisfactory to the local authority, that proper provision has been made for the care of the child. (b) That no employer of labour shall permit a woman advanced in pregnacy to engage in factory labour unless her ability therefor has been certified to the satisfaction of the local authority. 7. (a) That, having regard to the ascertained fact that in centres of industries where women are largely employed away from their homes, an excessive number of deaths of infants takes place, and that this is contributed to by the improper conditions existing at the houses in which the infants are placed out to nurse, it is necessary that the persons by whom and the places 6 into which infants are received should be under the supervision of the Local Sanitary Authority (b) That the Infant Life Protection Act be amended to remedy the abuses which are not at present provided against. 8. That all preparations offered or sold as food for infants should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injurious, and that each packer should contain its analysis. 9. That the Dairies, Milkshops and Cowsheds Order is defective, and that any amendment should extend the definition of disease as applied to animals, and should make the provision of Regulations by Local Authorities compulsory. That the scope of the Regulations should be extneded to cover dirty milk and should enable Local Authorities to prohibit the sale of any milk which fails to comply with the conditions of purity agreed upon. 10. That in the opinion of this Conference, the MidWives Act, 1902, should be extended to Scotland and Ireland. At the close of the Conference it was unanimously agreed:— That the Conference resolve itself into a Committe to give effect to the foregoing resolutions and with power to remit to an Executive Committee to carry out the same. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The following diseases are classified by the Registrar-General under this heading :—Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, "Fever" (Typhus, Enteric and Continued), Diarrhœa, Plague. The zymotic diseases caused 318 deaths as comcompared with 233, 211 and 2.57 for the three preceding years. The death-rate from zymotic diseases was 2.75, and for the three preceding years, 1.24, 2.32, 2.00; the average for the last five years being 1.95. The zymotic death-rate in England and Wales was 1.73, in the 76 great towns 2.24, and in the County of London 1.93. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The number of notifications received during the year, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 1,171, as compared with 991, 1129 and 1,184 for the three preceding years. Table No. 3 shows the total number received during the year, the number of cases in each district, also the number removed to hospital from each district. SMALL POX. Only one case of this disease was notified during the year. This was declared by the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Medical Officer to be an error of diagnosis, and was returned home. 7 SCARLET FEVER. The 674 notifications received during the year related to 649 cases, of these 9 proved to be errors of diagnosis, thus reducing the nett number of cases to 640. The number of cases during the last three years was 603, 405 and 501. The deaths were 16, compared with 9, 11 and 18 in the three preceding years. The death rate was 0.13 and for the three preceding years 0.07, 0.09, 0.20. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.10, in the 76 great towns 0.12, in the 142 smaller towns 0.09, and in the County of London 0.12. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3 :—North Deptford 286, South Deptford 121, Central Deptford 242. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANEOUS CROUP. There were 311 notifications received. Of these, three related to cases amongst the staff of the South Eastern Hospital, ten were errors of diagnosis, reducing the number of cases to 290, against 143 for last year. The deaths registered were 18, and for the three preceding years 9,16 and 45. The rate of mortality was 0.15 per 1,000 of the population, and for the three preceding years 0.07, 0.14 and 0.40, the rate in England and Wales was 0.17; in the 76 great provincial towns 0.19; in the 142 smaller provincial towns 0.17, and in the County of London 0.14. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3—North Deptford 94, South Deptford 66, Central Deptford 151. Bacteriological examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association of 137 specimens of membrane sent to them, of which 50 were found to be positive and 87 negative. ENTERIC FEVER. There were 40 cases notified, of these 3 were returned as errors of diagnosis, leaving 37 cases, against 30 last year; 35 of the cases were removed to hospital. It was not possible to trace the source of infection in any of the cases. The deaths were 6, in the preceding three years 6, 3, and 11 respectively. The death.rate was equal to an annual rate of 0 05, and for the preceding three years, 0.05, 0.02 and 0.03. 8 The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.09, in the 76 great provincial towns 0.09, in the 142 smaller provincial towns 0.09, and in London as a whole 0.05. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3—North Deptford 10, South Deptford 10, Central Deptford '20. Bacteriological examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association of 10 specimens of blood sent to them, 5 of which were found to be positive and 5 negative. ERYSIPELAS. There were 161 notifications of Erysipelas received during the year as compared with 152, 146 and 134 for the three preceding years. In connection with Erysipelas the Public Health Committee in July considered a letter from the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, suggesting that Erysipelas should be removed from the list of notifiable diseases, as they were of opinion that very little good resulted from its notification. In order to ascertain the views of other Sanitary Authorities, a communication was sent to each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, asking what action they were taking on the suggestion. Replies were received from 20 Boroughs, from which it appeared that 14 disagreed, and 6 concurred with Stepney in the matter. The London Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health have also passed resolutions disapproving of this suggestion. The Committee after full consideration recommended, and the Council passed the following resolution:—"That a communication be addressed to the Stepney Borough Council, informing them that this Council does not agree with the suggestion that the notification of Erysipelas should be discontinued." PUERPERAL FEVER. Notifications of 9 cases were received during the year, as compared with 7, 8 and 3 for the the three preceding years. Seven cases were removed to the Infirmary. The number of deaths was 2, against 1, 2 and 2 for the three preceding years. The death rate was equal to 0.01 per 1,000, com. with 0.008, 0.01 and 0.01 for the three preceding years. DIARRHŒA. The total number of deaths registered from the above disease was 146, against 84, 112 and 42 for the three preceding years. Of the 146 deaths, 140 were of children under five years of age, 119 of these were under one year of age. 9 The death rate per 1,000 persons living was equal to 1.26. The death rates for the past five years in Deptford and London are shewn in the following table. Deptford. London. 1901 0.94 0.86 1902 0.67 0.53 1903 0.64 0.64 1904 0.98 1.02 1905 0.73 0.73 Average for years 1901-1905 0.79 0.75 1906 1.26 0.94 The rate of mortality for England and Wales was 0.87, for the 76 great towns 1.16, for the 142 smaller towns 0.94, and for London as a whole 0.95. In North Deptford there were 55 deaths, in South Deptford there were 17, and in Central Deptford 74. MEASLES. The number of cases of measles dealt with during the year was 1,007, as compared with 600, 1,029, 273 for the three preceding years. As the disease is not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the above figure does not represent the total number of cases which have occurred in the Borough, as our only source of information as to the existence of cases is from the Head Teachers of the London County Council schools. The same procedure is adopted in the case of measles, with regard to disinfection, as if it was notifiable. Dr. Kerr, Medical Officer (Education), in his report to the Education Committee of the London County Council under the heading "Measles," says "measles is the most fatal disease of childhood." He pointed out last year (1905) that the ordinary history of measles in a school containing a number of children is somewhat as follows:—A child, who has contracted measles elsewhere, attends school in an infectious state, and a certain c 10 number of other susceptible children who are thrown more or less into intimate contact with it, contract the disease. Dr. Kerr calls the first case the seed, and the children infected by this child the first crop. The children of the first crop may act as seed for a second crop. So that he holds, that closure of schools, to be effectual, must take place before the first crop develops, that is to say, it must be carried out on the occurrence of the first case in a susceptible class. If it is deferred until the first crop has appeared, then the seed will have so widely spread that practically all the susceptible children will have received the infection, and will form the second crop. For practical purposes it must be assumed that all children who have not already suffered from the disease are susceptible, so that to work the system of individual exclusion, it is necessary to know the history of all the children in a class with respect to measles. Dr. Kerr holds that the balance in favour of closure, even at the earliest opportunity is doubtful, and that later, it is without doubt, futile. The following letter was received :— London County Council. Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 3rd April, 1906. Dear Sir, I have to inform you that the Council has adopted the undermentioned regulations for the exclusion from school of children suffering from measles, or coming from houses where measles exists " Children suffering from measles must be excluded for at least one month." Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, should be dealt with as follows :— (1) A child attending other than an Infants' school, who has had measles need not be excluded from attendance at school. (2) A child attending other than an Infants' school who has not had measles must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the first case. (3) A child attending an Infants' school whether or not it has had measles, must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the last case. This procedure supercedes the existing regulation, Sub sec. 5 of Section C of Article III. of the Provisional School Management Code. Yours faithfully, (Signed) James Kerr, Medical Officer (Education). H. W. Roberts, Esq., M.R.C.S., Borough of Deptford. c 2 11 The number of deaths which were registered was 71, as compared with 16, 72 and 72 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality was equal to 061 per 1,000 persons living, compared with 0.13, 0.64 and 0.64 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.27, in the 76 great towns 0.40, in the 142 smaller towns 0.22, and in the metropolis as a whole 0.40. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough was the cause of 61 deaths, compared with 18, 49 and 36 for three preceding years. The death-rate per 1,000 persons living was equal to 0.52 as compared with 0.15, 0.43 and 0.41 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.23, in the 76 great towns 0.28, and in the 142 smaller towns 0.20, and in the County of London 0.26. Of the 61 deaths from this cause 26 were of children under one year of age, and 34 of children over one year and under five years. North Deptford had 28 deaths, South Deptford 8 and Central Deptford 25. TUBERCULOSIS. Phthisis or consumption and other tubercular diseases occasioned 196 deaths, equal to a death.rate of 1.69 per 1,000 persons living, that for London as a whole was 1.44. The rate of mortality in the borough for the three preceding years was 1.58, 1.93 and 1.81 respectively. There were 63 deaths registered in North Deptford, 45 in South Deptford and 88 in Central Deptford. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and other diseases of the respiratory organs. The number of deaths registered during the year was 329 compared with 329, 344 and 293 for the three previous years. 75 were of children under one year of age, 64 of children over one and under five years, and 81 were of persons over 65 years of age.

The arrangement for the bacteriological examination and report upon doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, was renewed by the Council with the Clinical Research Association of No. 1 Southwark Street, London Bridge. The number of examinations made by them during the year ending 29th Debember, 1905, was 147; 137 of them being for 13 Diphtheria and 10 for Enteric Fever, the result being that 55 were found to be positive and 92 negative:— Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria 50 87 137 Enteric 5 5 10 55 92 147 At a cost of £32 11s. 6d. DISINFECTION. Disinfection is carried out at the Council's yard by means of a steam apparatus (Washington-Lyons), in which all articles of clothing and bedding are disinfected. Such infected articles which would be destroyed by steam, viz., leather goods, boots, furs, books, etc., are disinfected by formic aldehyde, volotised in an alformant lamp in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. There are two vans employed, one used for collecting infected articles, the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions, all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is made. The number of rooms disinfected by the Council's staff during the year was 1,769. The number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c. disinfected at the Council's yard being 8,575. No complaint of damage done to any article was received during the year, and only by the desire of the owners were any articles destroyed. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis where required. Disinfection of wearing apparel, &c., under the Midwives Act, was carried out in 7 cases. 105 books belonging to the Council's Public Library, collected from houses where infectious disease had occurred, were disinfected before being put back into circulation. 10 premises consisting of 28 rooms were fumigated during the year, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, as being verminous. THE SHELTER. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 60, Sub-Section 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. The premises are situated in Watson Street. It is very satisfactory to report the premises were not required to be used during the year. 14 MORTUARY AND CORONER S COURT. Considerable progress was made during the year for the erection of a mortuary and coroner's court. In February, the Council accepted the design of Mr. H. Bonner, of 13 and 14, King Street, Cheapside, E.C. In July, after certain modifications and amendments were made, advertisements were issued inviting tenders, and in December the Council resolved to accept the tender of Mr. S. B. Baldwin, of 10, Kemble Road, Croydon. I hope to have the pleasure of recording in my next annual report its completion and opening. During the year 68 bodies were received into the Mortuary.

The following table gives the result of the inquests held during the year:— Natural Causes 39 Accidents 35 Suffocation 10 Suicides 5 Drowning 9 98 15 SCHOOLS CLOSED. The following schools were, by my orders, closed during the year on account of an epidemic of measles:— Waller Road, Infant Department.

At a conference convened by the Southwark Borough Council in June, at the Town Hall, Walworth Road, mainly to consider the question of warranties in connection with the sale of milk, representatives of most of the Metropolitan Borough Councils were present. 17 On the motion of the Rev. Canon Horsley, the following resolutions were adopted: (a) "That in the opinion of this conference the provisions of section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and section 20 of the Amendment Act of 1899 operate to the prejudice of the purchaser and the public health, and should be repealed, leaving the seller to his remedy at common law against the persons from whom he purchased; (b) that notices in shops, etc., to the effect that milk therein is not warranted as pure shall be no defence; (c) that the act of mixing water or separated milk with whole milk for the purpose of sale shall be made a penal offence, and (d) that any Metropolitan Borough Council shall be enabled to sample at any railway station milk coming to dairymen in the area of that borough, although the station may be in another district." It was resolved to send copies of the resolutions to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, asking them to give legal effect to them. CANNED MEATS. In consequence of recent occurrences with regard to this matter, a circular letter was sent by the Local Government Board to the various Medical Officers of Health for the Metropolis, giving certain directions with regard to the matter. The letter was as follows:— Local Government Board. Office of Inspector of Foods, 50, Parliament Street, S.W. 19 th June, 1906. Dear Sir, I understand that in many administrative districts under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, samples of canned and preserved meats are being sent to public analysts. In view of the recent events in the United States, I am anxious to utilize the opportunity to collect information as to the use of preservatives and colouring matters in the foods in question. The presence of preservatives and colours in such foods as sausages, potted shrimps, etc., has often, of course, been ascertained, but the condition of certain other meat products, whether of home or foreign manufacture, in regard to preservatives is less clearly established; and there seems to be special need for information as to presence or absence of preservative in canned, tinned or other foods which are hermetically sealed, in view of the indication that may be afforded that the meat was not fresh at the time of "canning." Accordingly I am inviting public analysts by letter to supply me with facts as to preservatives and colouring matters in any meat products which they have lately examined or may shortly be receiving. d 18 In order that this information may be as complete as possible 1 would be much obliged if you would kindly arrange to transmit to the analyst, in regard of samples lately collected, or shortly to be collected, full particulars as to each sample, namely:— (a) The description of the article purchased. (b) The nature of the receptacle, if any, in which it was purchased (hermetically sealed tin or can, covered pot, &c.) (c) The name of the manufacturer, brand of goods, or any other statement on the label. I may state here that it is not intended to make published use of any name, &c., by which individual firms could be indentified. I would like to make a further suggestion regarding samples shortly to be collected, namely, that in case of meat products in cans, tins, etc., it would often be best that the whole sample as purchased be sent to the analyst. This proceeding would prevent prosecutions being instituted in the case of such samples, but on the other hand the principal point in many of these cases, alike for local and central authority, is knowledge of facts, before questions of prosecution are considered. By not dividing the sample the analyst has more material for examination, he can if he desires make bacteriological examination to see if the contents of the can, etc., are sterile, and he is better acquainted with the nature of the material he is testing. If, in ordinary circumstances arrangements regarding sampling under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts do not come under your direction, I would be glad if you would kindly forward this to the officer or officers of the Council with whom such arrangements rest. I am, Yours faithfully, (Signed) G. S. Buchanan. To the Medical Officer of Health, Deptford. In accordance with the directions contained in this letter, a number of samples of canned meats and other foods were purchased and submitted to the public analyst. There were 29 samples in all, consisting of soup, fish, meat pastes, cooked corned beef, roast meats, brawn, tongue, beef loaf, veal loaf, vienna sausage, corned beef hash, and pork and beans. These particulars were submitted to the Public Health Committee on the 11th July, when the report of the public analyst, on the examination thereof was read ; from which it appeared that in some cases the meat was fresh and good, in others there was considerable action on the tin and the contents were unusually soft, in others the samples were described as in an unsatisfactory condition as regards appearance, while in one instance he states that " while it is impossible to say that it is unfit for food, its appearance generally may be described as objectionable." The report also stated that all the specimens had been carefully analysed for preservatives, but with negative results, except in one d 2 19 case, in which a minute quantity of boric acid was detected. The general conclusions drawn by the Public Analyst are that artificial colouring matter being absent in every case it is evident that oxide of iron, aniline dyes, &c., are not in general use; and although in some cases the meat was uninviting, there was nothing which would warrant its being condemned as unfit for human food. In July, 1906, the Public Health Committee reported to the Council that they had had under consideration a communication from the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health transmitting a copy of the following resolutions passed at the annual meeting of the Metropolitan Branch of that society, viz.:— "That, in the opinion of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, it is necessary in order to secure better protection for the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods, that legislation should be passed embodying the following important reforms ":— 1. The name and address of the manufacturer and the date of canning shall be impressed on the cans. 2. It shall be unlawful to sell for any purpose canned goods that are unfit for human consumption, and it shall be the duty of any person in possession of unsound canned foods to notify and surrender same to the local authority, who shall destroy such unsound food free of charge. 3. A certain number of tins (say one per cent.) from each consignment shall be opened on importation and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the Sanitary Authority concerned, prior to such canned foods being placed on the market. 4. Tins which are known in the trade as "doubtfuls" shall be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. 5. Food intended for canning shall be inspected by pendent officials prior to being canned, and all foods shall be canned under strictly hygienic conditions. G. In the opinion of the branch the use of preservatives in canned foods is unnecessary, and should under no circumstances be permitted. The above-named society forwarded the resolution to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the London County Council also, and expressed the hope that this Council would adopt a similar course. The Committee, being of opinion that the precautions referred to in the resolutions were most desirable, recommended, and the Council resolved, "That communications be addressed to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture and the London County Council in support of the action of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, and that the Secretary of the Society be so informed." 20 BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. In June, 1906, a communication was received from the London County Council, in which it was stated that it had under consideration a suggestion that it should establish a laboratory and engage the services of a bacteriologist with the view of considerably reducing the cost of bacteriological examinations, a large number of which are required to be made by the several Sanitary Authorities and the London County Council during the year, and asking for the views of the Deptford Borough Council on the suggestion. A further letter was received in August stating that it had been suggested that any bacteriological examinations in such laboratory undertaken at the request of any of the Sanitary Authorities in London should be conducted without cost to such authority. As a result of enquiries made by this Council, it was found that eleven of the Metropolitan Borough Councils disagreed with the suggestion of the London County Council, two had decided to take no action, one required further particulars before arriving at a decision, and two agreed that the suggestion would be desirable. The Public Health Committee recommended, and the Council passed in July, the following resolution:— "That the London County Council be informed that this Council has already made arrangements for such bacteriological examinations as are required to be made so far as regards this Council, and is not prepared to take any action in the direction suggested by the London County Council." LAUNDRIES AND INFECTED CLOTHING. In February, the Public Health Committee considered a circular letter from the Islington Borough Council upon the above subject. It was pointed out that "the powers possessed under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, only apply to infectious diseases which are notifiable," and it was proposed that powers should be obtained respecting the transmission of any infected clothing to laundries. The recommendation of the Committee that "no action be taken" was referred back at the Council meeting of the 27th February, and upon further consideration and after a communication from the London County Council had been received upon the subject, the Committee recommended that "the London County Council be informed that this Council concurs in the suggestion that the sending of infected clothing to laundries should be made a punishable offence," which recommendation was passed by the Council on the 8th May, 1906 21 REVENUE ACT, 1903. In 1890 Parliament passed the Customs and Inland Revenue Act (33 Vict. Cap. 8), in which (Section 26, 2) they granted exemption from inhabited house duty for houses used solely for providing separate dwellings at rents not exceeding 7s. 6d. a week for each dwelling, provided that a certificate is produced from the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the house is situated, to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, with due provision for their sanitary requirements. The Medical Officer of Health must examine such premises on request for the purpose of ascertaining whether such certificate can properly be given. In 1891 Parliament extended the benefits of the Act, and in 1903 the provisions were again extended and embodied in a new Section (Revenue Act, 1903, Section 11), the previous enactments being repealed except with regard to the mode of obtaining the certificate. The exact words of the Section are:— II. (i.) Where a house, so far as it is used as a dwelling house, is used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings:— (a) The value of any dwelling in the house which is of an annual value below twenty pounds shall be excluded from the annual value of the house for the purposes of inhabited house duty; and (b) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual value of twenty pounds, but not exceeding forty pounds, shall be reduced to threepence; and (c) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual rate exceeding forty pounds, but not exceeding sixty pounds, shall be reduced to sixpence. The only application made under this Act during the year was with respect to six houses in Trundleys Road, containing twelve tenements; as suitable sanitary requirements were wanting, the certificates were refused. COMMON LODGING-HOUSE ACTS, 1851 AND 1853. The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common Lodging-houses. The following is a list of the Common Lodging-houses registered in this district, providing accommodation for 552 persons; in addition to the above there is Carrington House, Brookmill Road, which provides for 804 lodgers. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. The following is a list of the common lodging houses registered in the district, providing accommodation for 552 persons:— Beg. No. Date when registered.

The total number of premises inspected was 5,301, whilst re-inspections, calls, services of notices, etc., amounted to 13,566. The number of preliminary notices or "intimations" served during the year was 2,292, whilst the number of "statutory notices" served was 264, and in only one case was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders. Overcrowding was abated in 22 cases without having to take legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year 133 observations were made of chimneys emitting black smoke, and in 17 cases where black smoke was emitted in such quantity as to be a nuisance, notices were served to abate the nuisance. Legal proceedings were taken in one case only, Messrs. R. H.& L. Rogers & Co., Ltd., shirtmakers, Bolina Road, Cliftonville, and they were fined £5 and £1 3s. costs. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The bylaws relating to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, made by the Council pursuant to Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of houses so let or occupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. (c) For the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises. (f) For the taking of precautions in case of infectious disease. The number on the register is 269, the whole of which were regularly inspected with a view to seeing that they comply with the bylaws as regards cleanliness, overcrowding, etc. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. These premises have been regularly inspected during the year, and include hotel kitchens, restaurants, ham and beef shops, eel pie shops, fried fish shops, coffee shops and eating houses of all kinds, and any place where food is prepared or cooked for sale to the public. 24 A register of the premises is kept, and at present contains 106 premises of all kinds, an increase of 7 during the year, with a total of 148 rooms. 367 inspections have been made during the year, and 41 intimations served for the remedying of the various defects discovered. Constant inspection and attention is necessary in order to keep the various premises in a clean and satisfactory condition. Special attention has been paid during the year to the conditions under which work is carried on in sausage chopping, and ham and beef premises, and where found necessary, the occupiers of the premises have been called upon to carry out certain alterations, viz., to cement the walls to a height of five feet from the ground level, so as to render them washable and impervious; to pave the floors with a hard and impervious material, so as to be readily cleansed, and to provide proper receptacles for offal and refuse. Considerable improvement has been effected in the condition of these premises. BAKEHOUSES. These premises received special inspection and attention during the year. One bakehouse was taken off the register, not having been used for a considerable period, and in such a condition as to render it unsuitable. This reduces the number on the register to 77, as compared with 78 last year, 75 workshop premises and 2 factory premises. The number of inspections for the year was 328. Six intimations were served for various defects. No underground bakehouses were closed during the year; the number of same remaining at 28. The necessary cleansing and lime-washing was carried out in all cases. As a result of constant attention I am pleased to say that the bakehouses of the Borough were kept in a satisfactory condition. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. These premises were periodically inspected during the year, special attention being paid to the sanitary accommodation provided for the use of persons employed, under Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, also to cleansing and ventilation, the reception and issuing of outworkers' lists, and the keeping of the necessary registers. Where required, the necessary works have been carried out. It was not necessary to take any legal proceedings during the year. 25 I would again direct attention to the labour involved by the constant removal and change of address of persons on the register of outworkers. This required 164 names to be cancelled during the year. In one case it was necessary to take action owing to homework being done in unwholesome premises; and in three cases work was found on premises where infectious sickness had been notified, and the articles were disinfected before removal to the employers. The number of factories on register at the close of the year was 39 ; number of inspections, 68. The number of workshops on register at the close of the year was 269; number of inspections, 423. The number of outworkers on register at the close of the year was 411; number of inspections, 380. Workplaces other than the above (including food premises) were—on the register, 207; number of inspections, 389. 101 intimations were served during the year with respect to the various premises. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS AND PURVEYORS OF MILK. Constant supervision has been observed in connection with these premises. The number on the register at the close of 1905 was 193; there were added during the year 57, and cancelled during the year 52, leaving on the register at the close of the year 198. The number of inspections during the year was 504. Nine notices were issued during the year. The necessary cleansing and lime-washing was carried out, when asked for, it being necessary in very few cases to proceed by notice. Defective or corroded measures or vessels were prohibited, when found in use. Constant inspection is essential to enforce compliance with the dairies, cowsheds and milkshops orders, more particularly in small general shops. During the year the following circular was printed and circulated, a copy being served on each registered premises, and has had a good effect:— Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Public Health Department, Town Hall, New Cross Road, S.E. September, 1906. dairies, cowsheds and milkshops. Dear Sir or Madam, It has been found upon inspection, from time to time, of the dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, in the borough, that special care is e 26 not always taken with regard to the conditions under which the businesses are carried on. There are certain matters which require your special attention, amongst which are the following items:— Dairies.—All the milk stored in a dairy should be kept covered in such a manner as to prevent the access of dust or foreign substances of any kind, and upon delivery from the farm by rail should be strained immediately. All persons handling or dealing with the milk should be scrupulously clean in person and clothing. Cowsheds.—Cows should be groomed daily and their udders cleansed before milking. On inspection, animals have been found with dung accumulations on the udders and flanks in such a position that if not removed must contaminate the milk in the process of milking. The persons milking should carefully cleanse their hands before operating. The walls of the cowshed should be periodically brushed down and kept free from dust and cobwebs. Milkshops (Registered Purveyors of Milk).—Milk for sale on shop counters, &c., should be kept covered in such a manner as to prevent the access of flies or dust from any other commodity, or from the street surface in dry or dusty weather. Milk should not be kept near such articles as paraffin oil, fish, &c. Preservatives.—No preservatives of any kind should be added to milk. Notice is Hereby Given that action will be taken under the Sale of Foods and Drugs Acts in instances where preservatives are reported in milk. I trust you will give the above your very careful consideration so far as it may apply to your premises, and that you will take every precaution to prevent any conditions arising likely to deteriorate the quality of the milk. Yours faithfully, H. W. Roberts, Medical Officer of Health. In no case was it found necessary to take legal proceedings. Infectious Cases.—The following cases of infectious diseases have occurred in connection with dairy and milkshop premises during the year:— Scarlet Fever 3 Dipththeria 1 Erysipelas 1 Membraneous Croup 1 Measles 3 9 cases In each case the necessary measures were taken, in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. 27 ICE CREAM. The inspection of these premises was continued, and where found necessary cleansing and repairs carried out. Street barrows were kept under observation, but owing to the action of the police with regard to obstruction, the number was very materially reduced during the year. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was 114, an increase of 15 on the previous year. Number of inspections, 241. The making of ice cream is general in the summer months, and the premises concerned are confectioners, and Italian wholesale dealers, and itinerant vendors. Constant supervision is necessary to control the premises occupied by the Italian dealers. No legal proceedings were found necessary during the year. COWSHEDS.

I have the honour to present the following report under the Canal Boats Acts, for the year ending December 31st, 1906:— During the year 48 visits for the purposes of inspection have been made, on the following dates, viz. January 19th and 26th; February 1st, 9th, 15th, 16th and 23rd; March 1st, 9th, 15th and 23rd; April 5th, 11th, 24th and 25th; May 3rd, 4th, 10th, 18th and 25th; June 2nd, 7th, 12th, 15th, 18th and 20th; July 4th, 9th, 13th 19th, 26th and 27th; August 4th, 9th and 15th; September 7th, 10th, 19th and 27th; October 2nd, 11th, 12th and 26th; November 2nd, 9th, 22nd and 30th; December 6th. Boats were inspected on 29 occasions, as follows, viz.:—On February 1st and 16th; March 9th, 15th and 23rd; April 11th (2 boats) and 24th; May 3rd (2 boats), 25th and 30th; June 2nd, 7th, 11th, 18th and 20th (2 boats); July 4th, 9th and 26th; August 4th; 29 September 7th, 10th and 19th; October 2nd, 11th and 26th; November 9th, 12th and 22nd; December 6th (3 boats). Number of visits 48 Number of boats inspected 34 Infringements. The following matters were found calling for attention:— 1st February.—Boat "Charles" 254, registered at Brierley Hill— No date on registration papers. Year 1905 only stated. New register provided and certified by the Inspector of Registration Authority. 3rd May.—Boat "Lois" 237, registered at Brierley Hill—Registration mark and number defaced and partly obliterated. Repainted and certified by the Inspector of Registration Authority. 2nd October.—Boat "Vic" 153, registered at Brierley Hill.—No pump on board. Under notice to provide. 71th October.—Boat "Mary" 244, registered at Brierley Hill.— No pump on board, no water vessel on board.

On 8 boats during the year children of school age were found, and on each occasion information was forwarded to the local educational authority for their attention. This effort is rendered useless by the continual movement of the boats, as before the school officers can take action in the matter the boats are out of the district. No cases of sickness have been found on board the boats during the year. I have again pleasure in stating that I find the boats kept in a very clean and habitable condition. An increased number of boats have come under inspection during the year, being 34, as compared with 17 of the previous year, but the portion of the Canal within the Borough is very little used by boats within the jurisdiction of the Canal Boats Acts. This borough is not a registration authority. f 30 The arrangements made for the inspection of boats are—Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector duly appointed an Inspector under the Canal Boats Acts, jointly with other duties as Inspector of Workshops, Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, &c. Name and address of Inspector—Thomas Turner, 161, St. Asaph Road, Brock ley, S.E. Remuneration of Inspector—£2 per annum (part of salary as a Sanitary Inspector) apportioned to these duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Thomas Turner, Canal Boats Inspector. I desire to express my appreciation of my staff who have so ably assisted me during the year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. W. Roberts, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX. 32 Table No. 1. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD.
