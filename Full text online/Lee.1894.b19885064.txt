Pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, the following is the Report of the proceedings of the Board in the execution of that Act and the statutes amending the same, and of the works commenced and completed respectively in the year ended 25th March, 1895, and the works remaining in progress at the termination of such year, and also of any proceedings taken by the Board in such year for the removal of nuisances or the improvement of the Sanitary condition of the District. Some of such works and proceedings are shown in detail in 12 the reports of the Surveyors and Sanitary Inspectors and other Officers following. There are also annexed hereto copies of the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, and other tabular statements, including a report (Table A, page 18), showing Population, Number of Houses, and Rateable Value in respect of each Parish in the District as compared with last year and with the whole Metropolis. The result of the election of the last County Council is also shown (page 17). 2. The annual report of the Public Analyst for this District is also published herewith. 3. Particulars of prosecutions by the Board for offences are also given in a separate report. 4. The Acts of Parliament under which this Board exercises its various powers in this District of the Metropolis, are chiefly as follows:— The Metropolis Management Acts. 5. The Metropolis Management Act, 1855, 18 and 19 Vic., Cap. 120, is the Act under which the Board was originally constituted and the District defined. The District, then called Plumstead District, included the following parishes, viz.:—Charlton, Eltham, Kidbrook, Lee and Plumstead. The Metropolis Management (Plumstead and Hackney) Act, 1893, separated Plumstead from the District. It is now the “Lee District," and includes Charlton, Eltham, Lee, and Kidbrook Parishes. The Vestries of these Parishes elect members to the Board, the 13 vestries being themselves chosen by the ratepayers. The annual election of members to the Board by the Vestries takes place in each Parish on the first Wednesday in the month of June. One third of the members go out of office annually; all members go out of office on the first Wednesday in June in the third year from their election. The number of members for each Parish is set out in the tabular form at the foot of this report. The members of the Board were formerly persons rated or assessed at a certain amount. The Local Government Act, 1894, now regulates the qualification of members. 6. The principal duties of this District Board under the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855-90, and the new London Building Act, 1894, consist of the construction, repair, and cleansing of sewers (except main sewers, which are now vested in the London County Council), the supervision of house drainage, and the execution of the office of “Surveyor of Highways," and certain lines of frontage. The Board can repair, pave, light, improve, water, and maintain public ways, and prevent obstructions there. Paving works and sewers in new streets can also be constructed by the Board at the cost of the owners and occupiers. The growth of the District involves the frequent formation of new streets, and consequently much work has to be done by the Board in paving and sewerage. Under these Acts also, temporary repairs can now be executed by the Board in new streets, and this also has been done in several cases. 7. The expenditure of the Board, under these and other Acts hereinafter mentioned, and the contributions of the District to the expenditure of the London School Board, 14 are met by precepts issued by the Board to the Overseers of the various Parishes in the District in proportion to the rateable value of property in such Parishes. The rateable value appears in the table set out at the end of this report. The accounts of the Board have to be audited annually by three unpaid auditors chosen by the Board in April from amongst the Vestry Auditors of the District. The London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, has afforded some slight relief to this district. (See Accounts). Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 8. This Act came into operation on the 1st of January, 1892. It has been slightly extended by the “Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Amendment Act, 1893. “This Act of 1891 is a most important Act, and repeals many of the provisions of the Metropolis Management and other Acts. It also repeals the Nuisance Removal Act, 1855, and some sections of the later Sanitary Acts and makes new and in some respects different provisions in substitution of the Acts repealed, and also makes additional provisions with regard to Public Health in the County of London. The Act of 1891 constitutes this Board the “Sanitary Authority" for the District. New provisions are introduced as to the appointment or re-appointment of Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors, and as to Polluted Wells, Cesspools, Mortuaries, and other matters. Duties are imposed upon the Board as a Sanitary Authority to properly cleanse and sweep Streets, including the footways, and to collect street refuse. All Owners and Occupiers are now exempt from obligation to sweep and cleanse footways. This Act 15 is now in operation, and prosecutions under it have been numerous. This Board passed and the Local Government Board approved some necessary bye-laws under this Act, in 1893, and others in 1895. Food and Drugs Acts. 9. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875-9, (38 and 39 Vic., c. 63, and 42 and 43 Vic., c. 30), the Board appoints Inspectors, who obtain samples of food and drugs, which are analysed by the Public Analyst appointed by the Board. The vendors of adulterated articles are prosecuted. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 10. The Housing of the Working Class Act, 1890, has been very much used in other and more crowded districts, but the houses here are comparatively new, and are not so closely built. The health of the district stands high, and the Board after enquiry has not found it necessary to take any proceedings under this Act. Local Government Act, 1894. 11. With the Annual Report for the preceding year was published a special report by myself upon the effect of the Local Government Act, 1894, on the constitution and powers of this Board. It is only necessary therefore to add that by an Order of the 23rd March, 1895, (amended by an Order of 4th April, 1895), the Local Government Board, with the concurrence of this Board, amongst other things, transferred from the Justices to the Vestries of the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrook, within this district, the duty of appointing Overseers for such Parishes respectively. 16 Bye Laws. 12. It having been found necessary to enact new Bye Laws, in lieu of those adopted by the Board in 1886, and which have since been much altered, a new consolidated set of Bye Laws has been prepared by me, and was approved and adopted by the Board in February, 1895, and has since been printed. Generally. 13. There is still a continuing increase in population, houses and streets, and consequently in the work and duties of the Board's officers. The report of Police Court proceedings annexed gives particulars of summonses issued. The rateable value of the District according to the Valuation List which will come into force on the 6th April next, is £278,616. The annexed Table “A" gives some other figures showing the growth of the district. The present movement as to rating Government property may hereafter relieve the ratepayers of some Parishes in this district. GEORGE WHALE, Clerk.

I have the honour to report to you upon the work done by me as Public Analyst to your Board, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, during the year ending March 31st, 1895. 2. During the year 100 samples have been analysed, and of these 90 were found genuine and 10 adulterated or of inferior quality. 3. All the samples were purchased and submitted for analysis by the Inspectors of the Board. 4. The subjoined tables give the various articles which have been examined, their number and description as well B 22 as the general analytical results, and where the article was found to bo adulterated the nature and extent of the adulteration are shown. 5. The milk supply still leaves much to be desired ; the groceries on the other hand were all of fair quality. With the exception of trifling additions of water to spirits, and the milk adulteration above mentioned, the food supply of the district is very satisfactory. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.S., Ed., Professor of Forensic Medicine in King's College, London. 23 TABLE I.

CHARLTON. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1894. To the Board of Works for the Lee District. Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Parish of Charlton for 1894, which I am pleased to say is a satisfactory one. It has been healthy throughout as regards serious illness compared with many other years, and in spite of the very large increase in the number of inhabited houses (which in 1893 equalled 93, and in 1894 equalled 49), the deaths have fallen from 222 in 1893, to 19G in 1894, and this in both instances include cases belonging to the Parish that died in out-lying institutions, etc. 26 The Births are less than last year by 32, in spite of the larger number of inhabited houses, viz., 336— Males 171 females 165 336 Giving a ratio of 24.214 per thousand of the population— estimated at 12,403. The Deaths are considerably less. Whereas in 1893 they numbered 222, this year, 1894, they have dropped to 196— Males 101 Females 95 196 Giving a ratio of 15'6 per thousand of the population, and if we eliminate the cases incidental to old age, premature birth, and violence, we shall show record of which no parish can complain. Deaths in Outlying Institutions. South Eastern Fever Hospital 3 Ship "Atlas" 1 Woolwich Union 3 Charing Cross Hospital 1 Greenwich Union 1 The Thames (Rotherhithe) 1 St. John's Hospital 1 Seamen's Hospital 1 Darenth Asylum 1 Throat Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 2 Banstead Asylum 1 Brompton Hospital 1 Evelina Hospital 1 " Red Lion," Woolwich 1 20 27 Infectious Diseases. With regard to these I should say the Parish has never been so free. The total number of cases notified from all causes has only been 75 (153 in 1893), and they may be classified as follows— Small Pox 11 Scarlatina 39 Diphtheria 13 Erysipelas 9 Typhoid 3 75 Out of which 40 cases were removed to the Hospital, and this year I may add that there was no delay in this being accomplished. The chief regrettable incident with regard to the Infectious Diseases, was the 11 cases of Small Pox, which arose from one case not being recognised as such, and from which all the cases arose. Three deaths were the result. There have not been so many cases of small pox in Charlton for many years. The promptest measures were taken by the Sanitary Department to stamp out the disease, and with satisfactory results. Ten cases were removed to Hospital, and one died before the ambulance arrived. 28 As regards Scarlatina, the record is very good indeed. Only 39 cases occurred, out of which 24 were removed, and 1 should say that there was no other Parish in the Metropolis, compared with the population, that could boast of so small a number. Here I should like to add that not once has a case recurred in a house after disinfection by the Sanitary Department. The Metropolis has no doubt suffered from a large amount of Diptheria, and Charlton is credited with 11 cases notified. I found some of these so trivial that I venture to think that they might have been called by a milder name—indeed, one of them had never been ordered to bed at all. Here is an instance of a case where a Medical Officer of Health might have some power of revising or confirming diagnosis, as the credit of a house or neighbourhood might suffer in consequence. Typhoid cases were only 3, and it was difficult to account for any of thsm, but at any rate the number is not large compared with other Parishes. 29 There were 9 cases of Erysipelas, but these were of no importance, and only one fatal result happened from them. There were 23 in 1893. This ends the cases of " Notifiable " Infectious Diseases, but there remains to be recorded a very heavy outbreak of Measles in October, out of which there were no fewer than 111 children excluded from, the Fossdene Road Board School in consequence. Fortunately there were very few deaths. Later in the year, in December, another outbreak occurred, in which the children attending the Charlton National Schools were mostly affected, but with the same satisfactory results, as taking the whole year through there were only eight deaths due to the disease. Whooping Cough frequently a very fatal disease among young children, has only 7 deaths—there were 6 last year—so that we cannot complain of any severe outbreak. During the whole year, and even during the latter months, the amount of Diarrhœa was merely nominal, and only 3 deaths occurred. This is a particularly small number for a year. 30 There has been no evidence or even suspicion of Influenza becoming epidemic daring the past year, and only a very few stray cases that have at all resembled it. Phthisis is responsible for 28 deaths against 16 daring 1893, and hero I would take another opportunity of stating, as I have done in previous years, that dampness is one of the predisposing causes to this disease, and should be avoided as much as possible. The overflow in the "Marsh District" has not been so severe during 1894, but that is no reason why the proposed relief sewer should not be laid down. Nothing but that can ever render that large piece of flat ground as dry and healthy as it might be. The deaths from Cancer are larger than usual, viz. 16. This is the misfortune rather than the fault of the neighbourhood. Old Age pure and simple, is recorded as the cause of 11 deaths, and some of these at a very advanced time of life. 31 Coroner's Inquests were held on 15 bodies. Ten of these were due to violence of various kinds, and 5 to sudden deaths from causes mostly natural. General. The only case of any importance that had to be taken to the Police Court during 1894, was with reference to a new road being formed (between Church Lane and Charlton Lane), with house refuse, etc. Various complaints arose, but for a long time I was unable to say that any nuisance arose, dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants, although I by no means approve of it as a suitable material for making a road, on or near which houses will eventually be built. The case was very thoroughly investigated by the Magistrate, and five hearings took place, during which time he (the Magistrate) viewed the place, with the result that this refuse, which had preivously been left very inadequately covered, was very thoroughly done, and it ended in the Magistrate dismissing one summons, and advising that the others should be withdrawn. He gave no costs in these cases, and although he considered that owing to the more recent measures taken to abate any nuisance, he intimated that he did not consider house refuse a suitable material to make roads of near to houses. This case, although the Board did not obtain a conviction, is useful in many ways. 32 A large amount of general work Las been carried on by the Sanitary Department during the year, and much fewer notices have had to be served, as in many instances property owners have adopted the suggestions of myself and the Sanitary Inspector without any trouble. Perhaps the greatest improvement in the Parish has come upon us in a very unexpected way—one that no local body could have enforced. About three months ago orders were issued by the Ground Landlords of the Marsh District (Roupell's) that all the property should be put in order to the satisfaction of their Surveyor. Since then roofs have been repaired, brickwork pointed, floors and window sashes improved, and a general overhaul of all premises. The Water Company has also exercised a greater watchfulness over their department, with a most satisfactory result? particularly in doing its utmost to ensure better fittings in houses. The chief difficulty affecting this is that the walls of the houses and closets are not sufficiently well built to stand the weight of a better apparatus, and the closets are all so low that there is not sufficient distance for a good fall to take place, and a really sufficient flush to occur. Bakehouses. Twice during the year (March and September) I have inspected them all, and have been able to report them as "satisfactory." The Inspector drops in from time to time, and we are thus assured that they are kept as well as one could expect.
