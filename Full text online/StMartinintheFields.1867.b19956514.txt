Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields for the Year 1867. There have been in 1867, 595 births and 561 deaths. Of children under 5 years of age, there have been 207 deaths, and of persons over 6O years, 117. There have been 79 deaths from zymotic diseases, against 82 last year: 8 of the deaths were caused by smallpox, 6 by measles, 6 by scarlatina, 36 by whooping-cough, 12 by diarrhoea, and 11 by typhus fever. There were 75 deaths from consumption, and 92 from other diseases of the lungs. In the workhouse the number of deaths was 68; in Charing Cross Hospital, 61. In comparing the mortality of the year 1867 with that of preceding years, we find the number of deaths smaller than any, although it is only less by 5 than the year 1866. The mortality from smallpox has exceeded that of any of the last 10 years, except 1863. Measles and scarlatina have been below the average, while whooping-cough has been very fatal : 11 deaths from diarrhoea show the smallest number for 10 years, as do those from fever. We have had no death from delirium tremens. We may observe how closely the number of deaths annually approximate in many classes of disease, while in others there are remarkable differences. From 19 cancer we had 5 deaths last year; in 1865 there were 6. Consumption caused 81 deaths in 1866; the last year only 64. In both these years the deaths from apoplexy were the same, 16. From paralysis 7 in the one year, 11 in the other. In 1867 there were only 6 deaths from diseases of the brain; in 1866 there were 11. From dheases of the heart, 21 to 40. Last year we had 71 deaths from bronchitis; in the preceding year, 65. From inflammation of the lungs, the numbers were 18 to 25. From premature birth and debility list year there were 31 deaths; in the preceding year 23. From old age the numbers were 36 to 39. In 1866 the deaths of persons over 80 years amounted to 21; last year to 16. From fractures and other accidents, the numbers were 17 last year and 18 the year before. I am happy to be able to report that the general condition of the houses occupied by the working classcs is both cleaner and in better repair than in any previous year, although there is still room for improvement. We have nearly succeeded in having every house let out in tenements cleansed and whitewashed at least once every year. The water supply has been more satisfactory, but the condition of the closets in some of the courts is almost uniformly disgraceful, although in many instances the landlord provides a person who cleanses them daily. We find from year to year less difficulty in regard to cleansing and repairing the houses let out in rooms. There has been no occasion during the last year to obtain the aid of the magistrates tor this purpose, our notices having been attended to with tolerable exactness. I have endeavoured to get the landlords to do all that is requisite in repairs, &c., during the milder months of the year. It is the duty of all to promote vaccination as much as possible. In all the cases of smallpox after vaccina c 2 20 tion which I have seen this year, the vaccine marks on the arm were very indistinct. Wherever this is the case. it is the duty of parents to have the children revaccinated. It happens too frequently that the mother is contented with having had the operation performed, but not so just as she ought to be to her own child, and to the vaccinator in giving him the opportunity of judging for himself of the effects of the operation by seeing the arm the day week after he has vaccinated. Every child should be again brought to the vaccinator the week following, as is always directed to the person bringing the child. Were this uniformly attended to so that vaccination could be repeated in all unsatisfactory cases, we should have little or no smallpox. I can speak with the utmost confidence of the value of carbolic acid in checking the spread of smallpox in several closely-inhabited houses, where one case only of smallpox occurred; the free use of the disinfectant having prevented its spread in every other instance, although three or four families of young children were living in the same house. The mortuary has been found more and more useful from year to year. There have been more bodies of the dead, awaiting burial, placed there this year than in any one preceding. I trust that the prejudice against parting with the bodies of the dead, where families have only one room, is diminishing, and that the mortuary will from year to year be more and more made use of.
