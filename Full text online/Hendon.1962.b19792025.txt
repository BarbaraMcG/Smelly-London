ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1962 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hendon Madam Mayor, Ladles and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Report for the year 1962. The health statistics were good in 1962. It is a pleasure to report that there has been no increase in lung cancer for the last two years, but this is probably a matter of statistical good fortune rather than any real reduction in the progress of this unpleasant disease. There is little evidence of any decrease in cigarette smoking, except perhaps in the medical profession, and there is an unfortunate impression that the age of onset of the addiction is being gradually lowered, especially amongst those who become wage earners as soon as they reach school leaving age. In the course of time such a trend must lead inevitably to an earlier onset of the disease. The smallpox scare at the beginning of the year caused considerable anxiety, especially as it was associated with the immigration of people from Pakistan, whose lack of literacy and frequent change of address made for administrative difficulty in contact tracking. No case occurred in Hendon, but vaccination was required by those who wished to satisfy the requirements of continental countries, by those proceeding to parts of the United Kingdom where mass vaccination was in practice, and others. As a result of the enthusiasm for vaccination about 1/5 of the population was vaccinated, and this should help to maintain the state of our herd immunity for some years to come. The surveillance of smallpox contacts drew attention to the extent of immigration from Pakistan, and the varied housing conditions of the immigrants. The Housing Act 1961 gives the Council powers to deal with "houses in multiple occupation" so that reasonable living conditions can be obtained, but, unfortunately, that part of the Act which will enable local authorities to require, with the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, compulsory registration of such houses does not come into operation until 1964. It is hoped that the Government's plans for "area improvements" will provide better housing conditions in houses which are structually sound but lacking in certain essential amenities i.e. bath or shower in a bathroom, wash basin, hot water supply, internal water-closet and ventilated food store. Under the scheme, 4 selected areas or blocks of such properties are surveyed and owners and tenants encouraged to take advantage of the Improvement Grants Scheme. It is doubtful, however, whether any real progress will be made in this work until local authorities are given powers to require compulsorily the provision of such amenities. More progress was made towards clean air, and two additional parts of the Borough are now Smoke Control Areas - Hampstead Garden Suburb and the Council's Whitefield Housing Estate. Work towards the formation of other areas proceeds steadily. In the interests of better dental health for future generations to be born and nurtured in Hendon, the Council has informed the Middlesex County Council, the Metropolitan Water Board and the Colne Valley Water Company that the Council are in favour of the fluoridation of those public water supplies which are deficient in it naturally. The investigation which was initiated last year by the Director of the Central Laboratory of the Public Health Laboratory Service has been completed and published*. I have included in my Report an extract from the report of the Hendon Old People's Housing Society and the report of the Chairman of the Borough of Hendon Old People's Welfare Committee. I would like to thank the members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement, and also the members of the staff for their loyal and conscientious service during the year. I have the honour to be, Madam Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J.L. PATTON, Medical Officer of Health *Galbraith, N.S., et al "Lancet" 1962, Vol. 1, p.372 "Pet Foods and Garden Fertilisers as Sources of Human Salmonellosis". 5 SECTION A: STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA GENERAL WARDS (9) AREA IN ACRES Edgware 2,327 Burnt Oak 477 Mill Hill 2,695 West Hendon 1,143 Central 1,139 Park 580 Golders Green 748 Garden Suburb 669 Childs Hill 593 Area of the Borough 10,371 Population figures supplied by Registrar General 150,720 Density of population, i.e. number of persons per acre 14.53 Number of inhabited houses at 31st December 1962 (according to Rate Book) 44,942 Average number of persons per house 3.35 Rateable value as at 31st December 1962 £3,722,724 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £14,900 BIRTHS LIVE BIRTHS: Male Female Total Legitimate 971 1,030 2,001 Illegitimate 74 64 138 1,045 1,094 2,139 6 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 14.19 Birth Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 13.62 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 6.4% Comparability factor supplied by Registrar-General 0.96 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home population, England & Wales 18.00 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Hendon for the year 1961 13.44 STILLBIRTHS Male Female Total Legitimate 11 13 24 Illegitimate 3 3 6 14 16 30 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Total Births 13.78 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Total Births, England & Wales 18.1 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 0.19 DEATHS Male Female Total 832 797 1,629 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population 10.80 Death Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 11.34 Comparability factor supplied by Registrar-General 1.05 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population, England & Wales 11.9 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Hendon for the year 1961 11.43 7 MATERNAL MORTALITY Number of women dying in consequence of childbirth 1 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 total births 0.46 Comparative figure for England and Wales 0.35 INFANTILE MORTALITY: Deaths of infants under 1 year of age:- Male Female Total Legitimate 21 17 38 Illegitimate 1 1 2 22 18 40 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births 18.7 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births - legitimate 18.9 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births/illegitimate 14.49 Death Rate of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 21.4 Deaths of infants under the age of 4 weeks:- Male Female Total Legitimate 19 12 31 Illegitimate 1 1 2 20 13 33 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 15.42 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 15,1 8 An analysis of the causes of death and the age at the time of death reveals the following figures:- Causes of death Age at the time of death Under 1 day 1-7 days 1-2 weeks 2-3 weeks 3 weeks to 1 month TOTAL UNDER 1 MONTH 1-3 months 3-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months TOTAL UNDER 1 YEAR Prematurity 12 2 - - - 14 - - - - 14 Congenital defects 3 2 1 - 2 8 3 1 1 - 13 Pneumonia and Bronchitis - - - - - - 2 - - - 2 Intracranial haemorrhage - 2 - - - 2 - - - - 2 Asphyxia - - 1 - - 1 - - - - 1 Haemolytic disease - 1 - - - 1 - - - - 1 Atelectasis 4 2 - - - 6 - - - - 6 Peritonitis - - 1 - - 1 - - - - 1 TOTAL 19 9 3 - 2 33 5 1 1 - 40 9 TABLE 1 The following table shows the Infantile Mortality Rates over the various years.

This is 1,123 less than the Census figure for 1961. BIRTHS The number of live births recorded during the year increased by 26, 2,139 occurring compared with 2,113 in 1961, giving an increased corrected birth rate of 13.62 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 13.44 last year. The rate is less than that for England and Wales, which is 18.0 per 1,000 Home Population. The number of stillbirths increased from 26 to 30, giving a stillbirth rate of 13.78 per 1,000 total births compared with 12.15 in 1961. The rate for the Borough of Hendon compares favourably with that for England and Wales, which is 18.1 per 1,000 total births. DEATHS There was a decrease of 15 in the number of deaths. This gives a corrected death rate of 11.34 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 11.43 in 1961. The rate for England and Wales is 11.9 per 1,000 Home Population. As in previous years, heart and associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths, 638 people dying from these causes. Second in the principal causes was cancer. Deaths from motor vehicle and other accidents decreased, 31 people dying from these causes compared with 50 in 1961. Twenty four people committed suicide, an increase of five on the previous year. INFANTILE MORTALITY Forty children died in the first year of life compared with 36 in 1961, giving an infantile mortality rate of 18.7 per 1,000 live births. The rate for England and Wales is 21.4 per 1,000 related live births. 14 Of the 40 children, 33 died before reaching the age of 1 month, giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 15.42 per 1,000 live births compared with 15.1 for England and Wales, MATERNAL MORTALITY One woman died as a result of childbirth, giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.46 per 1,000 total (Live & Still) births. DEATHS FROM CANCER OP THE LUNG AND BRONCHUS During the year in Hendon 26 men and 11 women under 65 years of age died from this cause. 15 Borough of Hendon DEATHS PROM CANCER OF LONG AND BRONCHUS DEATHS PROM RESPIRATORY TUBERCULOSIS 1951-1962 16 ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS The following tables show the road traffic accidents and casualties occurring within the Borough of Hendon during the year 1962 and the comparative figures for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961. It should be noted that the figures shown refer not only to Hendon residents but also to persons living in other areas who were involved in accidents within the Borough. The figures for fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those shown in the list of causes of death supplied by the RegistrarGeneral. The Registrar-General's figures refer to Hendon residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Hendon or outside the district.

Fatal accidents were excluded, but a coloured diagram was prepared to show the number of accidents at the different ages, and the amount of time spent in hospital as a result of home accidents and from road traffic accidents. The traffic accidents were, however, differentiated into four different categories - pedestrians, motor cyclists, cyclists and motorists. The number of accidents at different ages is shown in the diagram by the central column of black squares. Age 0-5 In this age group home accidents predominate. Traffic accidents are negligible. The infant and toddler is especially liable to accidents at home, and it will be seen that these accidents necessitate a considerable period of time in hospital. The accidents are varied, and in an attempt to reduce their number the following factors might be studied:- (a) the standards of flammability of textiles for children's clothing; (b) the design of furniture and baby carriers of all kinds and toys, to minimize the possibility of injury; (c) more adequate control of poisons, so that common drugs and household requisites, for example aspirin and paraffin, are made difficult of access to children in this age group. An accident not unknown, occurs when the hand and arm of a small child is caught in the wringer of a washing machine. Pesticides, weed killers, chemical cleansers ano plastic bags are all hazards to child life. If we look at the American experience to find out what hazards the future may hold we must include power tools, mowers, discarded batteries and discarded refrigerators. The discarded motor car with its potentially explosive petrol tank is another menace. Age 5 - 10 The total shows that children in this age group escape from the home to suffer as pedestrians on the roads, with age groups 7 and 8 spending a large amount of time in hospital. Age 10 - 15 This particular age group is fairly free from accidents although road traffic accidents to cyclists are noticeable. 20 Age 15 - 20 Youth in this age group suffers a large number of road traffic accidents, especially as motor cyclists. Age 20 - 25 At this age home accidents are infrequent, but the young motorist is now in danger. Age 25 - 50 This age group would appear to be relatively free from serious accidents both at home and on the road. Age 50 - 75 Between the age of 50 and 75 the effects of accidents which probably occurred in the previous age group become more serious. At home, accidents as a result of "do-it-yourself" activities and the use of complex tools by relatively unskilled people cause accidents which result in a considerable degree of hospitalization. Between the ages of 50 and 75 the pedestrian would appear to be very vulnerable to road traffic accidents. Pedestrians would appear to have suffered more serious injury than motorists. Cyclists in this age group are more vulnerable to serious accidents. Over 75 There is a noticeable decline in hospital admission from road traffic accidents, and a very marked increase in the time spent in hospital as a result of home accidents. I am indebted to Mr. E.L. Tricky, F.R.C.S., Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Edgware General Hospital, for providing me with the information on which this short survey has been based. 21 22 SECTION B: PREVALENCE OP, AND CONTROL OVER.

PUERPERAL PYREXIA There was a decrease in the number of cases of Puerperal Pyrexia, 39 cases occurring compared with 92 in 1961. Of the 39 cases 17 only were Hendon residents, the remainder being women from other areas who entered the maternity hospital in the Borough for their confinement. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM Two cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum were notified during the year, compared with none in 1961 SCARLET FEVER There was a decrease in the number of cases notified, 53 cases occurring compared with 59 in 1961 MEASLES During the course of this year, 138 cases of Measles were notified compared with 2,215 in 1961. Measles tend to occur in epidemic form every two years. An epidemic can be expected about Spring 1965. WHOOPING COUGH There were 14 cases of Whooping Cough notified as compared with 25 in 1961. SONNE DYSENTERY There was a decrease in the number of cases notified - 13 compared with 37 in 1961. The disease is usually mild in character. TYPHOID FEVER There was one case of Typhoid Fever notified in Hendon. The patient was a school-girl who had recently returned from a holiday in Israel and North Africa. 26 PARATYPHOID FEVER One case of this disease was notified. The patient, a school-boy, had recently returned from a holiday in Southern Italy, where he had been drinking well water. This was probably the source of infection. FOOD POISONING During the year 29 cases of food poisoning were notified compared with 31 in 1961.

AREA SERVED The official catchment area of the Edgware Chest Clinic includes the whole of the Borough of Hendon and the Edgware, Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of the Boroughs of Harrow and Wembley. The clinic is. in fact, sited very close to the meeting point of the boundaries of the three boroughs mentioned. The Middlesex County Council appoints Health Visitors and Welfare staff whose work is based on the chest clinic. They deal primarily with patients in the catchment area. Many patients whose homes are in fact outside the official catchment area are referred by their practitioners for opinion and are dealt with at the clinic. LIAISON Close liaison is maintained with the Health Departments of the Middlesex County Council - in particular the Area Medical Officers and the Medical Officers of Health for the Boroughs of Harrow, Hendon and Wembley is maintained. The Welfare Department of the Chest Clinic keeps in touch with many statutory and voluntary organisations such as the Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour, the local 34 offices of the National Assistance Board and Ministry of National Insurance, the Housing Departments of Local Authorities, Councils of Social Service, the Chest and Heart Association, Regimental Benevolent Associations, etc. On the therapy side there is close liaison with Edgware General, Colindale and West Hendon Hospitals of whose staffs our physicians are members. Patients are sometimes referred to Clare Hall, Harefield, Pinewood and St. Charles' Hospitals for treatment of tuberculosis, for thoracic surgery and for treatment in bronchitis units. Patients for radiotherapy are referred to the Middlesex Hospital and to Mount Vernon Hospital. Consultant staff from these hospitals are numbered amongst the visiting consultants of the chest clinic SOURCE OP PATIENTS The majority of patients are referred to the Chest Clinic by their general practitioners. Considerable use is made of the facilities for X-ray of the chest without previous appointment. patients referred in this way are examined on 70mm. miniature film and a number of them are subsequently called for examination by a physician where this appears necessary. Patients are also referred from the various divisions of the Out-patients Department of Edgware General Hospital or from the In-patient Departments of Edgware, Colindale and West Hendon hospitals. Others come from the Mass Radiography Units and from Chest Clinic in other parts of the country (when a patient moves his home into our area). TUBERCULOSIS The primary function of the Chest Clinic is to deal with pulmonary tuberculosis. During 1962 the number of cases on the register fell by 144 and is now about two thirds of what it was 10 years ago. The number of new cases of tuberculosis was 17 less than in 1961 and about one half the number in 1952. Although diminished the tuberculosis problem is not yet solved; but progress is encouraging. Unfortunately, some new cases are still quite advanced by the time that they are referred for investigation. The disease occurs particularly in young people of both sexes and in the older males. The fact that admission of tuberculous patients can be arranged without much delay has meant that the serious problems of 10 years ago are no longer with us, and has diminished the work of the Welfare Department quite considerably. CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG The diagnosis and treatment of this condition continues to be a major 35 activity of the Chest Clinic. The disease in the majority of instances is due to cigarette smoking and could be prevented if this habit was overcome in time. HYPNOTHERAPY Regular clinics are held for the treatment of asthma and certain psychosomatic disorders by this medium. Patients deemed to be suitable in this form of treatment are selected and seen by appointment. ANTI-SMOKING CLINIC At the latter end of the year, a start has been made in the provision of special facilities to help patients give up smoking. It is appreciated that certain people who genuinely wish to give up the habit, need help to overcome the addiction. These people are being seen and helped at regular sessions and, although the numbers dealt with to date are small, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the coming year. CHRONIC BRONCHITIS Chronic bronchitis, emphysema and associated conditions are common amongst chest clinic patients of all ages, but esnecially so amongst the older age groups - particularly in males. It is the result no doubt of many factors of which atmospheric pollution is an important one. Previous reports have made mention of the scheme to send some severe bronchitics to country hospitals with bronchitis units. This benefits the patient and avoids inevitable admission to a local hospital bed in January or February when the pressure on beds is at its highest. Further notes on how this scheme has fared are appended. During the seven winters 1956 to 1963 during October or November, consideration was given to recommending the admission to a bronchitic unit in a hospital outside the built up area of Greater London of middle aged or old men with the chronic bronchitic syndrome and a degree of respiratory failure. Altogether 45 patients were considered on 131 occasions and admission was offered on 89. On 53 occasions the patient accepted a bed. The country hospitals had been asked to keep the patients from November until February so as to miss the period when smog was most likely to occur in London. On 6 occasions the patients were discharged prematurely. This was followed by 2 deaths (33%) and admission to local hospitals with respiratory illnesses on 3 occasions (50%). Of the 27 patients admitted to the bronchitic unit on 53 occasions, 4 died in hospital (8% of admissions or 15% of patients). Of the 78 occasions, on which 39 patients were either not offered a bronchitis unit bed or refused the offer, there were 10 deaths in the relevant winter (13% of 36 occasions or 26% of patients). On 31 occasions (40%) admission to a local hospital bed was necessary during the relevant winter. INDUSTRIAL ILLNESS The use of a chemical in a local factory caused an outbreak of respiratory symptoms amongst some of those in contact with it. Occurring as this did during the winter months when bronchitic illnesses are so common it was not immediately realised that the problem was one of industrial hazard. The recognition of this fact was made after a short interval and enabled steps to be taken to prevent further cases. RESEARCH AND EDUCATION Co-operation with the Medical Research Council and British Tuberculosis Association on research into chronic bronchitis has continued. Post graduate instruction to public health and to clinical students has continued during the year. PUBLICATIONS H. J. Trenchard Carcinoma of the Bronchus in a Community.

A person requiring a licence or renewal of a licence under this part of the Act must make application to the Local Authority giving certain information, such as age, nationality, technical qualifications and the nature of the establishment and the business conducted thereat. The Council considered and granted the following applications:- New Licences 2 Renewal of Licences 30 Certificates lodged under Section 363 by members of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy 4 Licences Refused NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Section 47 This section deals with securing the necessary care and attention by removal to hospital or other place of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. In no instance was it considered necessary to use the powers available under the Act, but nevertheless the Act is valuable in that the knowledge that the statutory power of removal exists often helps towards an effective decision. In dealing with the problem the co-operation of Mr. C. Austwick, the Area Welfare Officer, has been greatly appreciated. 40 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 SECTION 50 - PUBLIC BURIALS Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is required to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who died or been found dead in their area if in such case it appears to the Council that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. During the year nine burials were carried out, eight adults and one child. GENERAL HOSPITAL FACILITIES Edgware General Hospital. Hendon District Hospital. The needs for mental treatment are served by Napsbury Hospital. INFECTIOUS DISEASES - HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION West Hendon Hospital. Neasden Isolation Hospital, Willesden. Any other Infectious Disease Hospital controlled by the North-Western Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT AND HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION Edgware General Hospital. Admissions are also arranged through the Regional Hospital Board to the Regional Chest Hospitals, particularly Clare Hall and Colindale. The Chest Clinic at Edgware serves primarily those living in the Borough of Hendon and the Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of Harrow and Wembley. HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL The following services are provided by the Middlesex County Council under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946:- * Care of mothers and young children (Section 22) * Midwives Service (Section 23) * Health Visiting (Section 24) 41 * Home Nursing (Section 25) * Vaccination and Immunisation (Section 26) * Chiropody Service (Section 28) * Domestic Help (Section 29) School Health Services and Dental Services (Provided under Education Act, 1944, the Borough of Hendon being an Excepted District). * These services are administered on an area basis, Area 4 consisting of the Boroughs of Hendon and Finchley. The Area Health Committee acts as a Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the County Council and consists of representatives of the two Boroughs, Middlesex County Council, certain professional bodies and other persons with special knowledge of these services. MEDICAL PRACTITIONER SERVICE AND CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS The Middlesex Executive Committee has classified the different wards of the Borough into three categories, (1) Open Areas - Burnt Oak, Central, Childs Hill, Mill Hill and West Hendon. Applications from doctors to enter practice in areas classified as Designated or Open will be granted automatically on the completion of their arrangements. (2) Intermediate Areas - Edgware and Park. In these areas the number of patients on the average general practitioner's list is reasonable. New practices may be established in such areas but the initial practice allowance is not likely to be paid. (3) Restricted Areas - Garden Suburb and Golders Green. These are areas in which the numbers of doctors is adequate. Normally applications by doctors to start new practices is not granted. LABORATORY FACILITIES These are provided at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. Specimens may be sent direct to the laboratory by medical practitioners or by special collection from the Public Health Department provided they are received not later than 3.30 p.m. Monday to Friday. I would like to express my appreciation of the work carried out by the staff at the Laboratory who, during the course of the year, have given considerable advice and help to the Public Health Department. 42 The number of samples taken in respect of milk, ice cream, domestic water supplies and swimming pools is shown elsewhere in the report. the edgware group health services liaison committee Fifth Report of the Edgware Group Health Services Liaison Committee I am indebted to Dr. G. Barwell, Chairman of the Edgware Group Health Services Liaison Committee, for the following report on the work of the Committee since 1961 "MEMBERS Nominated by Hendon Group Medical Advisory Committee Dr. G.S.C. Sowry Dr. W.E. Snell Dr. J.A. Livingston Mr. E. ap I. Rosser Nominated by Middlesex Local Medical Committee Dr. G. Barwell (Chairman) Dr. J.S. Lindsay Dr. G.N. Grose Dr. F. McConnell Thomson Nominated by the Hare field & Northwood Group Hospital Management Committee Dr. R. Grenville Mathers Nominated by Middlesex County Council to represent the Local Health Authority Dr. G.S. Wigley Dr. E. Grundy Dr. K.M. Bodkin Dr. W. Cormack Nominated by the Hospital Management Committee to represent Nursing Services when the Committee deals with Maternity problems Miss L. Darker Nominated by the Borough of Hendon Dr. J.L. Patton (Secretary) The aim of the Medical Liaison Committee is to improve Liaison between the different branches of the National Health Service and it serves also as a Maternity Liaison Committee for the Area. The Committee is always glad to learn of any difficulty between the different branches of the National Health Service which would benefit by discussion. Since 1961 the Committee has considered many and varied problems, but the following are of special interest:- 43 Since 1961 the Committee has considered many and varied problems, but the following are of special interest ACCOMMODATION FOR OLD PEOPLE The Committee submitted the following resolution to various authorities:- "That in this area accommodation provided by the Geriatric Department of the Hospital Service and by the Welfare Department of the County Council is inadequate in quantity and that, taking into account the increase in demand which is occurring and will continue to occur, the Authorities concerned should take immediate steps to increase this accommodation." A reply from the Middlesex County Council indicated that the County Council was anxious to provide additional welfare accommodation, but the rate at which new homes can be established is entirely dependent on the speed at which loan sanction for the projects are issued by the Ministries concerned. The waiting list for such accommodation in Middlesex is over 700. New homes have been opened at Ithell Court and Preston Hill (opened and functioning 100 beds - April 1962) in Wembley, and further homes were under construction at Copeland Avenue and Stanmore. MENTAL HEALTH The Committee heard a symposium on Mental Health from Dr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Heimler, Mr. Inglis and Dr. Greenberg, and consideration was given to the difficulty of admitting the disturbed elderly patient to hospital. GENERAL PRACTITIONER PARTICIPATION IN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE The possibility of General Practitioner participation in the Hospital Service was considered under the following headings:- 1. Assistance by G.P. in the Out Patients Departments of Hospital. 2. Assistance in In Patients work in certain Departments. 3. The access to certain Departments. 4. The question of Clinical Meetings etc. 5. The role of the Hospital as a centre for reference and particularly for the provision of a medical library open to all doctors in the Area. 44 6. The development of G.P. units within general hospitals. 7. The continuance of special units for G.P.s as exist at the moment in this area. 8. The recruitment of G.P.s from amongst junior hospital staff some of these would be serving part-time in hospital, part-time in the G.P.s surgery. MATERNITY LIAISON Clinical Assistantship for General Practitioners The Committee learned that the Hendon Group Management Committee had approved the suggestion that a limited number of General Practitioners should be appointed as Out Patient Assistants in the Ante-Natal Clinic at Edgware General Hospital. Early Discharge of Maternity Patients The North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board drew attention to the increased pressure on maternity beds, and it was suggested that the discharge of a number of carefully selected patients after 48 hours would help the situation, provided that maternity nursing was available and that there were arrangements for domestic help. An approach is to be made to the Ministry to try to modify the system of maternity grants so that the patient will suffer no financial disincentive. The Maternity Co-operation Card The Committee are considering the introduction of the standard maternity cooperation card to include important basic clinical data which could be held by the patient for the assistance of any doctor or midwife called to her in emergency. The matter is still under consideration. Blood Grouping Mr. Rosser explained that routine A.B.O. grouping in pregnancy had never been adopted in Edgware General Hospital because it was the practice to rely on cross matching at the time of transfusion WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE I am indebted to County Councillor Miss E.M. Weavers, B.A., F.R.S.A., Chairman of the Hendon Old People's Welfare Committee and to Mr. E.B. Pinder Davis, Hon. Secretary for the Report for the year 1962/63. 'VISITING. In the previous Annual Report particular emphasis was laid upon the need for a well organised visiting service as the basis for the work of an Old People's Welfare Committee. We are now glad to report that a grant of £850 per annum for the employment of a whole-time Supervisor of Visiting has been authorised 45 by the Middlesex County Council. The post of Visitor has been advertised and it is hoped that an appointment will be made without delay. It is anticipated that the Supervisor will spend her mornings visiting and devote the afternoons to work in the office. Application has been made to the Borough Council for a grant for running a car. TRANSPORT This will probably always present problems. We continue to receive most valuable help from members of voluntary organisations and from individual car owners. To all of them we are most grateful, particularly for their help with the housebound and disabled, as these activities could not continue without this help. HANDCRAFTS The second Handcraft Exhibition in this Borough was held at Hendon County School on October 30th last year. The number of entries was smaller than on the previous occasion but most of the work submitted was of excellent quality. The Group Trophy was won by the Friendship Clubs and the Visitors' Trophy by Friern Barnet. The 1963 Handcraft Exhibition organised by the Middlesex Old People's Welfare Committee takes place in Wembley Town Hall on Wednesday October 23rd and this Borough expects to be well represented. ANNUAL APPEAL This brought in just over £200 gross. This figure does not include donations which are received from time to time but which may not be the direct result of the appeal letter. CLUBS The "Over 60's" Club continues to play an important part in the lives of its members. But for reasons which were discussed in last year's Annual Report the membership is not growing. It had been intended to hold a New Year Party in January but this was cancelled because of the weather. An outing by coach to Southend in June is being arranged instead. The "Third Thursday Club" for the housebound and disabled continues to meet each month at Station Road. Unfortunately owing to the weather, there were no meetings in December and January, but members met again in February after this rather long interval. 46 CHIROPODY This important service continues to be operated jointly by the Middlesex County Council Health Department and ourselves. The County have approved a small increase in the number of patients who may be treated in private surgeries, but nearly all new applicants are now referred to the County Clinics in various parts of the Borough. Mrs. McCabe continues her valuable domiciliary visits and is able also to bring us information about special needs of certain of her patients. NAPSBURY HOSPITAL Dr. Patton had informed the Committee of a request, which he had received from the Secretary of the Friends of Napsbury Hospital, asking for visitors who would be willing to go to the hospital and mix with some of the patients. Mrs. Josephs brought this to the notice of the League of Jewish Women. A group of sixteen membe: has been formed of whom four visit the hospital each week. They meet the patients an informal way, play games with them and sometimes make music. Dr. Pattison of Napsbury Hospital is very pleased with the results. The Committee are glad that that help is being given at an institution which must always have a certain proportion of patients from this Borough. LUNCHEON CLUBS Arising from Ministry of Health Circular 12/62, the Hon. Secretary visited Willesden and Harrow to obtain information on the operation of Luncheon Clubs in those two Boroughs. His report has been discussed by the Executive Committee and sent to all members of the Main Committee. Further discussion will take place with a view to making a recommendation to the Borough Council. ORANGE HILL SCHOOL At the Chairman's suggestion and with the approval of the Headmistress, a groui of senior girls visited members of the Third Thursday Club at Christmas taking small gifts. This appears to have been a great success and numerous letters of appreciatj were received. TELEVISION FOR THE HOUSEBOUND For the last two years we have been paying the licence fees and repair charges on two television sets. One set was bought with the help of a £30 grant from the Television Society. The second was a discarded set which we had put in order but which now needs replacing. We feel that gifts of second hand television sets shouli in future be refused. But several radio concerns supply on hire reconditioned 47 small screen sets receiving both programmes for about 22/25 shillings per month. This charge covers service and replacement if the set goes wrong. The annual cost to the Committee for each set including the licence would be £17 - £18. This would be a most beneficial activity and, as suggested under "Finance", a proportion of our fund raising might well be devoted to this purpose. HOLIDAYS The Annual holiday which we organise at Cliftonville was again very successful. Red Cross Nurse O'Brien who accompanied the party gave, as always, indefatigable service. Two questions now need consideration: (i) It may be necessary to find further occommodation for the people who are able and willing to pay £7 to £8 for one week at the sea. (ii) From enquiries which are received in the office it seems clear that there is a substantial number of elderly people who are unable to save anything towards a holiday and who, therefore, never get away. For these, an assisted holiday appears to be the answer. FINANCE As will be seen from the Accounts our annual expenses continue to exceed our income. The Chairman's appeal has not in itself proved a satisfactory means of raising funds. A co-ordinated effort such as a really well organised bazaar held every two ytars, might be more satisfactory. In any case, it is felt that any fund raising effort is more likely to succeed if it is made clear that the proceeds will be devoted to some special purpose not covered by statutory grants. Meanwhile, it will probably be necessary for the Committee to discuss its financial position with the Borough Council " HENDON OLD PEOPLE' S HOUSING SOCIETY I am indebted to the Honorary Secretary, Mr. A.E. Harvey of 36 Grampian Gardens, N.W.2. for the Annual Report for 1962 which describes the work of the Society at Church Walk House. The Report Includes the following comments - "During the past year we have continued to do our best to give comforts to those in our charge, although it is not always easy to win the confidence of a difficult resident, but when achieved it is one of the most rewarding experiences of all. There have been ten new entries, fourteen sent to hospital, eight left for various reasons and five died. 48 There are still many elderly people waiting for Part III accommodation. Much can be done to reduce this, by encouraging them to remain longer in their own home, with the assistance of voluntary organisations, Home helps and the District Nurses. Much is being done in Middlesex to interest the husbands of Home Helps. During the last six months 37 Housing Associations for the elderly have been formed in this Country, bringing the total up to 286. In a recent address to the National Old People's Welfare Council, Dr. A.M. Exton-Smith, Secretary of the British Geriatrics Society, stated that old people were making a much greater claim on the hospital services now than at the start of the National Health Service. At the present time, more than 50 per cent of patients in general wards of hospitals were of pensionable age and over, and this was twice as many as in 1948. He referred to the debate in the House of Lords in December 1961, during which figures were quoted showing that there were over one million people of pensionable age in England and Wales confined to their homes and a further 98,000 confined to bed. It was obvious from these figures that old people would provide a major challenge to the Health Service during the next twenty years. Flatlets: Mention was made in the last Report of our proposal to build a block of flatlets for elderly people who are still capable of looking after themselves in suitable accommodation. I am pleased to say we hope to start building in April 1963. (The estimated cost is £21,094. There will be 12 single flatlets and two double flatlets for married couples, together with Warden's accommodation). We are greatly indebted to the Hendon Borough Council for a grant of £2,500 towards these flatlets; also they have kindly arranged a mortgage." STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year under review 116 new entrants or employees of the Hendon Borough Council were medically examined for superannuation purposes. Of this number 114 were passed as fit, and a decision on two others was deferred for a further six months. The number of examinations in respect of each department of the Council was as follows:- Town Clerk's 12 Borough Treasurer's 10 Borough Engineer's 55 Borough Librarian's 17 Borough Housing 22 Medical Officer of Health's - 116 49 SECTION D: Sanitary Circumstances of the Area WATER SUPPLY The Borough has a dual source of supply. The northern part is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the central and southern portion by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Colne Valley water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk and before distribution to the consumers the water is under constant supervision of a chemical and bacteriological staff which carries out examinations in modern laboratories situated at the works. The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board is selected Thames water which has been subjected to purification by storage in which time it is freed of the bulk of organisms. It is filtered through rapid and then slow filters, attaining a degree of purity which compares favourably with the general supplies in Great Britain, but as a further safeguard terminal chlorination is applied which ensures a first class water in every respect. Samples of water are examined bacteriologically, chemically and for taste and other special purposes on every day. The supply to all areas was satisfactory in quality and quantity. Number of dwelling houses supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to houses 44,942 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Number of population supplied from public water mains:- (a) Direct to houses 150,720 (b) by means of standpipes Nil Natural flouride content of water supplies:- Colne Valley Water Company: Fluoride content - Nil Metropolitan Water Board : Fluoride content - 0.25 parts per million. The water supplied to Hendon is deficient in fluoride and dental decay is more prevalent here than in those areas where the element is present in optimum quantity. 50 HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Housing Officer for the following observations on the Council's building and development progress during the year and on the housing situation generally - "The main feature of the Housing Programme for 1962 was the letting of Granville Point and Harpenmead Point. These 15-storey point blocks each containing 60 flats are the tallest blocks erected to date by the Council and complete Phase I of the Granville Road Redevelopment Scheme. Work on the following Phases has commenced, which will in course of time diminish the industrial character of this area, and the present medley of obsolete buildings will gradually be replaced by modern flats and maisonettes. At the end of 1962 the total number of post-war dwellings erected by the Council was 3,118. The purchase of dwellings in advance of actual redevelopment continues to bring under Council control many dwellings which can be used for habitation, and these are being used for the relief of overcrowding and other instances of housing hardship. The pool of family dwellings is also added to from time to time by the purchase by the Council of owner-occupied houses where the residents, who are elderly, seek smaller property suitable for their advancing age. In these cases the Council is able to offer a choice of elderly persons bungalows and flats in a convenient locality. The Council has given support to plans submitted by private housing associations for the new building or conversion of property for occupation by elderly people. Demand from the more elderly members of the community for small selfcontained units of accommodation continues, as it is apparent that the majority of such persons are anxious to remain independent of outside care for as late in life as possible. The problem of the rehousing of families under orders of eviction has continued to receive attention. In most cases action has been taken to avoid hardship ana in very few instances has a family first had to be admitted to a County Council reception centre or to face separation. An average of one family a week transferred to the New and Expanded Towns during the year, and support was given to nearly 100 housing applicants seeking employment and rehousing away from the Greater London area. The Housing Waiting List at 31st December, 1962, numbered 1,875 families with a further 238 applicants recorded from elderly persons requiring bed/sitting-room accommodation. Ordinary applications for housing during the year numbered 421 and from single people 75. 51 Applicants assisted in 1962, were as follows:- (a) Rehoused into permanent accommodation (pre-war) 68 (b) Rehoused into permanent accommodation (post-war) 100 (c) Transferred to other accommodation so as to resolve cases of overcrowding or under-occupation of Council dwellings 274" PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION A staff consisting of Chief Public Health Inspector, Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector, nine District Public Health Inspectors and one Pupil Public Health Inspector,is employed in the Department. The duties of these officers necessitate inspection of several different types of premises and dealing with numerous matters affecting the health and welfare of the public.

Rag Flock - supervision of use in making of upholstery etc., Exhumations - attendance to see that these are properly conducted. During the year 10,559 inspections and 11,850 reinspections were made and 653 samples taken. Details of these are given later in the report. In addition to visiting and inspecting premises, the Inspectors devote a considerable amount of time to interviewing members of the public seeking advice on various health matters, owners and builders proposing to execute works,householders regarding their liabilities under Smoke Control Orders, food traders regarding their premises and supplies, etc., The Inspectors have regular hours i.e. 9.a.m. - 10.a.m. and 5.p.m. - 5.30.p.m. when they are in attendance at the Town Hall and are available for interview. The rest of their time is spent out on their respective districts. 54 NOTICES SERVED To deal with unsatisfactory conditions found during the course of the above inspections, the following notices were served:- Informal or Cautionary 747 Statutory Notices Served under Public Health Acts 53 Served under other Acts, Regulations, etc.102 As will be seen from these numbers, the majority of matters found requiring attentions are successfully dealt with without recourse to the service of Statutory Notices under the various Acts, Orders or Regulations. The institution of legal proceedings only became necessary in the following instances:- Charge Result Failure to pay his proportion of The Magistrates made an order re- the cost of work carried out by quiring the Defendant to pay the the Council in scavenging a private amount of £1.0.3d. due and awarded common passage in default under Sec. the Council costs. 78,PHA1936.

HOUSING Inspection of dwelling houses during the year- Number of dwellings inspected at which defects were found requiring action under the Public Health Acts 360 Number of houses surveyed for action under Housing Acts 40 Number of houses surveyed for issue of Certificates of Unfitness under Housing (Financial) Provisions Act, 1958 17 Number of houses surveyed and reports submitted for use by District Valuer in connection with negotiations for acquisition by the Council 102 Total number of inspections and reinspections made 4,650 55 HOUSING ACT. 1957 Six houses were dealt with under the Act, involving the making of one demolition order and five closing orders. As a result of this action or that taken under the Act in previous years, 21 unfit houses were demolished, and three others were closed after the occupants had been rehoused. Twelve families comprising 36 persons vacated unfit properties dealt with under the Act, the majority being rehoused by the Council. Three parts of houses were closed during the year involving the rehousing of five families comprising 17 persons. HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 Certificates of Unfitness were issued in respect of 22 houses in the Council's ownership. These were all in areas scheduled for redevelopment. The acceptance of these Certificates by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government enabled the Council to claim "slum clearance" subsidy in respect of the houses or flats provided to rehouse the tenants. The "slum clearance subsidy scheme" terminated with the passing of the Housing Act, 1961 except for projects for which tenders had been accepted before the Act came into operation. The tender for the two "point" blocks in Granville Road had previously been accepted and these Certificates of Unfitness in addition to those issued previously enabled all the 120 units of accommodation in this scheme to be erected with the aid of the subsidy. The following housing projects were erected with the aid of slum clearance subsidy - New Brent Street 129 units Tennyson Road and Cheshir House 53 units Granville Road 120 units Total 302 units The subsidy attracted in the 60 years over which it is payable will amount to £966,754. During the year 73 houses which had been the subject of Certificates of Unfitness in this or previous years were demolished. 32 families comprising 90 persons were rehoused from Council-owned unfit houses during the year. 56 UNFIT HOUSES MADE FIT AND HOUSES IN WHICH DEFECTS WERE REMEDIED The following houses were made fit or had defects remedied as a result of action taken:- After informal action 303 After formal action under (a) Public Health Acts (i) by owner 45 (ii) by local authority 10 (b) Housing Acts (i) by owner 2 (ii) by local authority SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMME The Council's slum clearance programme which commenced in 1955 when the Minister of Housing and Local Government re-introduced slum clearance work has almost been completed. Very few houses now remain to be dealt with, but others will no doubt be found from time to time which will have deteriorated to an extent which will demand their closure or demolition. Two principal aspects of the Department's housing work remain to be dealt with - (a) houses in multiple occupation (b) houses in good structural condition but lacking essential amenities, i e., bath or shower in a bathroom, internal watercloset, lavatory basin, hot water system with supplies to sink, bath and lavatory basin, and a ventilated food cupboard. The Housing Act, 1961 gave the Council power to require adequate provision in houses in multiple occupation of natural and artificial lighting, ventilation, water supply, personal washing facilities, drainage and sanitary conveniences, facilites for the storage, preparation and cooking of food, installations for space heating or for the use of space heating appliances, and proper means of escape from fire. 57 A preliminary survey of the Borough showed that there are approximately 2,000 houses in the Borough let in multiple occupation. A large proportion are in areas scheduled for redevelopment but bringing the remainder up to a proper standard will keep the Department's resources as fully occupied during the next few years as they have been recently in dealing with slum clearance. The squalid conditions found in some of the muIti-occupied houses certainly demand as energetic action as any devoted to clearing the areas now under re-development. A further survey also indicated that there were approximately 1,000 houses in good structural condition with a useful life left of at least 20 - 30 years but which were without the standard amenities detailed in (b) above. Steps are being taken to visit each of these blocks of property and to bring to the notice of the owners and tenants the benefits of the Improvement Grants Scheme. OVERCROWDING The following report on overcrowding for the year ended 31st. December, 1962 was submitted to the Ministry of Health as required by the Public Health Officers Regulations, 1959. (a) Number of dwellings known to be overcrowded at end of year 10 Number of families dwelling therein 12 Number of persons dwelling therein 64 Equivalent number of persons dwelling therein (Section 77 Housing Act, 1957) 57 (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 9 (c) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 10 Number of persons concerned 46 Equivalent number of persons concerned (Section 77, Housing Act, 1957) 35 (d) Cases in which dwelling houses in respect of which Local Authority has taken steps for abatement of overcrowding and have again become overcrowded. Nil It is very unlikely that the above represents the entire extent of the overcrowding in the Borough but they represent the only cases known to the Department. These cases were brought to our notice either by tenants seeking to improve their "points" position on the Council's housing application list, by Medical or Hospital Authorites, or by owners endeavouring to secure possession of tneir properties on the grounds that they were overcrowded. It is probable that much more evidence of overcrowding will be discovered now that the systematic 58 inspection of houses let in multiple occupation has begun. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. RENT ACT, 1957 The following figures show the number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair and Revocation received and the action taken during the year. Applications for Certificates of Disrepair. No. of applications for certificates 7 No. of decisions not to issue certificates No. of decisions to issue certificates 8 (2 previous,1 (a) in respect of some but not all not proceeded defects 5 with) (b) in respect of all defects 3 No. of applications outstanding at end of year 1 No. of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 5 No. of undertakings refused by Local Authority No. of certificates issued 2(1 previous) Applications for Cancellation of Certificates No. of applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 1 No. of objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates No. of decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections No. of certificates cancelled by Local Authority 1 59 CARAVANS CARAVAN SITES & CONTROL OP DEVELOPMENT ACT - 1960 There Is now only one licensed caiavan site in the Borough. This is at a site at Brockley Hill, Stanmore, and is for one caravan only. The conditions attached to the licence were in process of being complied with at the close of the year. A site at Brent Park Road, N.W.9. is used only for winter Quarters by members of the Showman's Guild of Great Britain and so is exempt from the provisions of the Act relating to site licences. Town Planning Enforcement action is being taken in respect of caravans which were placed during the year on land adjoining the North Circular Road, N.W.2. Action also has to be taken from time to time to remove caravans from the grass verge and a service road at the North Circular Road, N.W.2. The owners of these caravans are usually engaged in scrap metal dealing and car breaking and frequently leave accumulations of unwanted rubbish and other filth behind. Although commonly referred to as gypsies, the shiftless population of these caravans have no connection with or semblance of that respected race. On one occasion a group of such caravans could not be "moved-on" as the entire adult male population was remanded in custody. One hundred and seventy visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to caravans during the Year. DRAIN TESTS AND DRAINAGE WORKS Test of drainage systems and examination of sanitary fitments were carried out and reports submitted thereon during the year as follows:- For prospective purchasers of properties 10 In connection with applications for advances under the Housing (F.P.) Act 1958 59 Fees are paid to the Council for this work. In addition 66 tests of drainage systems were carried out in connection with the investigation of nuisances. As a result of the above sanitary surveys the following works were carried out under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors:- Main drains relaid or repaired 39 Branch drains relaid or repaired 111 60 Manholes reconstructed or repaired 103 Soil or ventilating pipes renewed or repaired 48 Fresh air inlets renewed, repaired or removed 29 Sanitary fitments renewed 117 Gutters or rainwater pipes renewed or repaired 49 Gullies or gully surrounds renewed or repaired 41 Waste-pipes renewed or repaired 41 378 inspections and 1970 reinspections were made in connection with drainage and plumbing works being carried out. CLEARANCE OP BLOCKED DRAINS The Council continues to operate its service for the clearing of drains at private premises, where this can be done by rodding or plunging, on request by owner or occupier. The charges for this work are as follows: During normal working hours 15. 0d. Evenings - Monday to Friday £1.10. 0d. At week-ends £3. 0. 0d. The use made of this service continues to grow, no less than 1248 drains being cleared during the year. Fifty-three were cleared at weekends. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Parts of Mill Hill, Elstree and Barnet Gate remain unsewered, 145 properties being served by cesspools or small septic tank sewage disposal installations. 291 requests for the emptying of the cesspools or septic tanks were complied with, the work, in most instances, being carried out at the Council's expense. By the end of the year the Council had decided to lay a new soil sewer to serve the Burton Hole Lane, N.W.7. area. This will permit the number of cesspools to be reduced by 32, and should considerably reduce the pollution of the Folly Brook which occurs from time to time. The major part of the Borough is sewered by gravity sewers of adequate capacity, with the exception of the Hendon Way soil sewer which carries surface wager drainage from old development in the Childs Hill area. The work 61 of redeveloping the old parts of this area has, however, already commenced and separate surface water drainage will be provided for this new development. This will ameliorate to a great extent the surcharging of the Hendon Way sewer. The main trunk soil sewers discharge into the West Middlesex trunk sewer which has its outfall at Mogden, Middlesex. The surface water drainage of the Borough is carried by public surface water sewers and open watercourses into the River Brent and the Dollis Brook, which discharge to the Brent Reservoir. Over the past six years extensive flood relief schemes have been carried out by the Council for dealing with run-off from normal storms. The Council's proposals are by no means completed but the necessary work of preparatory investigation and preparation of technical reports is proceeding, so that flooding difficulties which occur during times of normal storms may be ameliorated. POLLUTION OP WATERCOURSES Two hundred and five visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors in investigating the pollution of watercourses. The waste-pipes from 71 sinks or lavatory basins were found to be incorrectly discharging to surface water drainage systems and thence to watercourses. These were dealt with, either by having the fitments removed or the waste-pipes diverted to soil drainage systems. A number of complaints were received of oil pollution of the watercourses. These are not so easily dealt with. Two major sources of pollution were successfully traced and steps taken to prevent a recurrence, but a number of minor sources could not be located. These probably arose from thoughtless pouring of waste oil down surface water gullies in garage drives. This may seem a matter of little importance to those disposing of the oil, but to householders whose gardens border on to open watercourses, the prolonged pungent smell of oil during the summer, when at times there is little flow of water, can be most nauseating. LOCAL LAND CHARGES ENQUIRIES During the year, enquiries were received from the Town Clerk in respect of 3388 properties. These related to any action being taken under the Public Health, Housing and Rent Acts, inclusion in Smoke Control Areas and in Housing Areas (areas schedules for redevelopment). The necessary enquiries or inspections were made and the information supplied. 62 SCAVENGING OP PRIVATE PASSAGES AND ACCOMMODATION ROADS The Public Health Inspectors made 489 inspections or re-inspections of private passages or accommodation roads. Very few of such passages, etc., have been taken over and are scavenged by the Council. The scavenging of the great majority remains the responsibility, under the Public Health Act, 1936, of the occupiers of the premises to which the passage or road affords access. Most of the accommodation roads have to be repeatedly visited by the Inspectors to deal with accumulations of rubbish left outside premises. Proper scavenging is frequently impracticable, the roads being unpaved and at times an insanitary quagmire after heavy rain. Sections of road at the rear of premises having no access to the road have to be scavenged jointly by the occupiers of those premises with access. This, of course, usually results in these sections of road receiving no attention unless pressure is brought to bear by the Public Health Inspectors. Rubbish is also dumped at times by unknown outsiders, causing great annoyance to shopkeepers, etc., when they are called upon to arrange and pay for its removal. On nine occasions it became necessary for the Council to carry out the work of scavenging a road or passage in default, and to proceed to recover the cost from the occupiers of the premises concerned. In one instance proceedings had to be ta jn in the Magistrate's Court to recover the expense. A further problem arises in the usually 3-feet wide passages between the rear gardens of houses which are used by the refuse collectors for the removal of refuse from the houses. Neglected fences are sometimes allowed to lean or collapse over the passages, or trees to overhang, so obstructing the refuse collectors in their work, sometimes to an extent that the use of the passage has to be discontinued and refuse collection made from the front of the houses through which the full bins have to be carried by the householders. Much is done informally by the Public Health Inspectors to deal with the owners of the fences and trees but there does not appear to be any satisfactory statutory power under the Public Health Acts to require them to keep the passages unobstructed. The only satisfactory remedy to deal with this problem of private accommodation roads and passages is, in my opinion, the making up of them under Part IX of the Highways Act, 1959, and the'- subsequent maintenance and scavenging by the Council. Records show that this is the procedure which the Public Health Department has been urging since 1930, but little progress has been made in doing so. PEST AND VERMIN CONTROL During the year, 541 inspections and 322 re-inspections were made of premises by the Public-Health Inspectors in connection with the control of a wide variety of 63 insect pests. Each year sees an increasing number of requests from housewives for advice on the identification of insects they come across in their homes and on the method of eradication and control. Many of these insects are of little or no public health significance but in every case steps are taken to supply the appropriate information and advice and, if necessary, the premises are visited and an inspection carried out. The incidence of vermin (bugs, fleas and lice) is now very low, only seven infestations having to be dealt with. In these cases disinfestation work is carried out by one of the Council's rodent operatives who has been trained in this work. Wasps nests are also destroyed, free of charge, 180 being dealt with during the year. Routine inspections of the effects of new Council tenants are also carried out prior to their removal into their new accommodation, but it is now only very occasionally that any evidence of vermin is found. In these cases the necessary disinfestation work is carried out before removal takes place. 246 inspections were made during the year The Public Health Act, 1961, gave the Council power to take steps " for the purpose of abating or mitigating any nuisance, annoyance or damage caused by the congregation in any built-up area of pigeons". As a result of complaints received, steps were accordingly taken to deal with those which had congregated under railway bridges and in the roofs of vacant houses awaiting demolition. 242 pigeons were removed and 106 eggs destroyed. The pigeons are taken by hand, late at night, when they are roosting, and handed to the local Inspector of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for disposal. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949 - RODENT CONTROL Rodent control at dwelling houses and business premises is carried out by a foreman, three whole-time and one part-time operatives working under the supervision of the District Public Health Inspectors and in accordance with recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The foreman and operatives attend refresher courses arranged by the Ministry from time to time to ensure that they are properly aware of the latest methods and poisons, etc., in use. Treatment of sewers is carried out by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. A few instances occurred, particularly in the Edgware District, of rats breaking out from sewers via the rodding arms of intercepting traps and defective fresh air inlet heads on the drainage systems of houses. The necessary rep airs to the drains were carried out by the householders and the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department advised so that disinfestation work could be carried out in the sewers. 64 In the case of dwelling houses, treatment is undertaken by the Council free of charge. In the case of business premises, a charge based upon time, cost of materials and overhead expenses, is made. An estimate of the cost is prepared and submitted to the occupier of the business premises and it is open to him either to accept it, engage a private specialist firm or undertake the work himself. Almost invariably the Council's estimate is accepted. Should an occupier elect to do the work himself, the District Public Health Inspector ensures that the treatment is successfully carried out. In a number of cases it was necessary to take steps to have removed accumulations of rubbish which had been harbouring rats, to have gardens or land cleared of excessive growth, or buildings made rat-proof. In no case, however, did formal action under the Act become necessary, all essential work of rat-proofing, clearing etc., being satisfactorily carried out as a result of representations to the occupiers or owners by the Public Health Inspectors. All of the rat infestations were by the Common (brown) rat. Ship (black) rats have not been found in the Borough for several years. Details of the work carried out during the year, in the form required by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is set out in appendix II. An infestation is considered to be "major" when more than 20 bodies are picked up after treatment. DISINFECTION Disinfection of rooms by the use of formalin spray is carried out after the incidence of certain notifiable infectious diseases and, in the case of tuberculosis, when considered necessary by the Chest Physician. Bedding and clothing were disinfected throughout the year at the disinfecting station at West Hendon Hospital by arrangement with the Regional Hospital Board, but as the disinfector used for clothing and for library books has become worn out, arrangements have now been made with Finchley Borough Council for this work to be carried out at their disinfecting station at North Circular Road, London N. 3. in future. Library books at houses where cases of certain notifiable infectious diseases occur, are removed and disinfected before return to the library. Disinfection is also occasionally carried out at other premises to meet the wishes of an occupier. In such cases a charge Is made for this service. Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad are disinfected on request and an appropriate accompanying certificate issued. During the year the following were dealt with:- Rooms 75 65 Bedding and/or clothing 189 Library books 87 Parcels of clothing to be sent abroad 40 DOMICILIARY LAUNDRY SERVICE A problem which arises in the case of aged and sick persons in their own homes, is the cleansing and laundering of soiled linen and clothing. Where such persons have no relative living with them who is able to deal with the articles, assistance is given under Section 84, Public Health Act, 1936, as amended by Section 42, Middlesex County Council Act, These sections give the Council necessary authority to have the articles collected and cleansed (laundered). During the year 12,175 articles were collected from the houses of 44 such incontinent persons. The articles are collected twice weekly and returned to them after laundering. The scheme frequently enables these people to remain in their homes instead of having to occupy beds in hospitals which can therefore be put to more urgent and better use. FACTORIES ACT, 1961 At the request of the Ministry of Health the tables showing the work carried out in the administration of the health provisions of the Factories Acts, are given in the prescribed form as an annex to the report. The occupiers of factories are required to supply the Local Authority twice yearly with lists of the names and addresses of persons employed by them as outworkers, i.e. carrying out work in their own homes. These lists are submitted in February and August. The homes are then inspected by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that conditions there are suitable. Twenty-two lists were received from employers in the Borough giving details of 130 outworkers. Of these 101 did not reside in the Borough and the appropriate details were forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned. In turn, notifications were received from other Local Authorities of 151 outworkers residing in Hendon but employed in factories elsewhere. 66 The homes of all the outworkers were Inspected but in no instance were conditions found to be unsatisfacory. In factories where no mechanical power is used in the processes involved, the Local Authority is responsible for seeing that proper cleanliness is maintained, that there is no overcrowding of employees, that ventilation is adequate, that a reasonable temperature is maintained, (one or more thermometers has to be provided in each room), that floors are properly drained if any wet process is carried on and that suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences are maintained. There are thirteen such factories in the Borough but at only one were matters found requiring attention, i.e. want of redecoration and failure to provide a thermometer. These were remedied. Fifty inspections were made. At factories where mechanical power is used in the process, the Local Authority is only responsible for seeing that suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences are maintained. 746 inspections or re-inspections were made of the 369 such factories in the register. At 66, matters were found requiring attention and the appropriate notices were served. At 89 factories works were carried out in compliance with notices, some of which were served in 1961. The Local Authority is also responsible for reporting to Her Majesty's Inspector of Factories any instances of where it is found that a factory does not have displayed an "Abstract" of the Act outlining its requirements, for the benefit of the employees. Forty-five such instances were notified to H.M. Inspectors. PREMISES LICENSED FOR PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT In accordance with the usual annual procedure, inspections were made at the request of the Middlesex County Council of the sanitary conveniences, kitchens, etc., at hotels, church halls, cinemas, restaurants, etc., licensed for public entertainment. Forty-six premises were inspected. At thirty-six premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. At the other ten the following were found requiring attention:- Sanitary Conveniences Repairs 4 Cleansing 3 Redecoration 5 Kitchens Repairs 2 Renewal of equipment 2 67 Cleansing 1 These were all satisfactorily dealt with and reports submitted to the County Council. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS One hundred and nine visits were paid to hairdressers' or barbers' establishments during the year to ensure that the requirements of the Council's bye-laws were being met. The following matters were found and appropriate action taken to deal with them. The necessary works or improvements were carried out without recourse to legal proceedings. Redecoration of (a) Saloons 10 (b) Staffrooms 13 (c) Sanitary Accommodation 11 General Repairs 6 Repairs to Sanitary Accommodation 8 Inadequate ventilation 2 Floors or floor covering worn 6 Inadequate Sanitary Accommodation for staff 1 Accumulations of rubbish 12 Drain choked 1 Insufficient number of covered receptacles for hair clippings, etc., 3 Repairs to upholstery of chairs required 4 Instruments not being properly cleansed before use on each person 1 Copy of bye-laws not displayed 1 Despite the efforts of the Public Health Inspectors to discourage the use of styptic pencils instead of powdered or liquid alum to stop bleeding, twelve barbers were found to be still using them. The bye-laws do not prohibit their use, the requirement being that, if used, they shall be kept clean. The Code of Hygiene compiled by the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers also strongly deprecates the use of solid sticks and recommends that styptics should be applied by spray or clean cotton wool. 68 RAG PLOCK AND OTHER PILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 This Act and the Regulations made thereunder prescribe standards of cleanliness for each of certain specified filling materials used in the manufacture of furniture, prams, toys, etc. Premises at which the work is carried out are required to be registered with the Local Authority and records have to be kept showing the amounts etc., of the filling materials used. Pour premises are registered with the Council. Each was inspected during the year and found to be conforming with the Act and Regulations. One new premises was registered. One ceased to be used for this purpose and the registration was revoked. SWIMMING BATHS There are two municipal-owned open air swimming baths and one open air school teaching swimming pool in the Borough. The privately-owned swimming pool open to the public at Hendon Hall Hotel was not used during 1962 because of building operations at the site. Samples of swimming bath water were taken during the summer months and submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination. The following are the results of the samples:- No, taken Results Mill Hill Swimming Bath 12 11 satisfactory 1 unsatisfactory West Hendon Swimming Bath 9 all satisfactory Broadfields Junior School Swimming Pool 3 2 satisfactory 1 unsatisfactory There was no apparent cause for the unsatisfactory sample at Mill Hill bath, where the standard is normally very high. The samples from Broadfields Junior School showed an improvement on previous years when difficulties had been met in controlling the chlorine input to the bath. 69 The following figures show the attendances at the two municipal-owned baths during the opening season. West Hendon Mill Hill Adults 3,918 11,872 Children 12,203 47,631 Season Tickets 2,267 6,041 Schools Middlesex County Council 8,607 14,006 Private 902 26,995 80,452 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Ten applications were received for the renewal of licences to keep pet shops. The "animals" kept included puppies, kittens, hamsters, guinea-pigs, rabbits, birds, mice, fish and reptiles. The premises were inspected for adequacy of means of ventilation, natural and artificial lighting, water supply, state of repair and cleanliness, arrangements for storage of food, hay and straw, disposal of excreta, adequacy of fire fighting equipment, and availability of some person with key to premises to be called in case of emergency when premises closed, and exhibition of suitable notice on door or window giving name and address of such person. All of the premises have now been brought to a high standard, the only item requiring attention being the renewal of a fire extinguisher. All applications for licences were granted. The opportunity was also taken to check on fresh meat on sale in these shops. Such meat, if from a knacker's yard, must have been sterilised or be stained with an approved green dye. In each case it was found, however, that the fresh meat on sale was either horseflesh fit for human consumption coming from slaughterhouses where the carcases had been properly inspected and passed as fit for human consumption by a Public Health inspector, or frozen horseflesh imported from abroad and accompanied by a Veterinary Certificate approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939 The riding establishments are inspected biannually by the Council's Veterinary Officer. 70 The four establishments in use in 1962 had a total of 52 animals. One pony was found to be unfit for work due to saddle sores which had developed as a result of the leatherwork of a saddle having become worn. The pony had already been withdrawn from use and was put out to grass until it recovered. All of the other animals were found to be in good condition. As a result of representation made to the owner of one establishment, the stabling was improved. The unsatisfactory stabling at Ebenezer Mews, N.W.2. which had been giving the Veterinary Officer some concern, was demolished during the year in connection with the redevelopment of the Hermitage Lane Housing Area and the animals transferred to temporary stabling until the building of the new stables is completed. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH & WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT,1956 Inspections were made during the year of the thirteen farms and other agricultural or horticultural premises in the Borough to ensure that the requirements of the Act relating to the provision and maintenance of suitable sanitary conveniences for the use of the workers, were being complied with. At five premises works of cleansing, redecoration or repair were found to be necessary. The appropriate notices were served and the works executed. At the other eight premises conditions were found to be satisfactory. One farm closed during the year. NOISE NUISANCES Complaints were received regarding 21 noise nuisances during the year. These related to Industrial or Commercial Premises. Noise from vehicles arriving during the night and from the work of repairing vehicles in open workshops. Observations showed that there was noise from panel beating in an open workshop, from an air compressor and electrically driven hand tools also in an open workshop, and from the arrival and garaging of taxis arriving between the hours of 1.0 am. and 3.0 am. To abate the nuisances the proprietors had a new workshop built to enclose the compressor and electrically driven tools, the panel beating shop converted to closed workshop with insulated walls and roof, a second entrance to the premises formed to avoid undue manouvring of vehicles inside the 71 premises with attendant "revving" of engines, and gave instructions to the drivers and night operatives to exercise care to keep night noises down to a minimum and posted notices to this effect. These precautions greatly improved conditions and no further complaints were received. Noise from break-down lorry going out at night. An inspection of the firm's records showed that the vehicle was called out only very occasionally at night. The management undertook to see that when called out the vehicle would leave and return as quietly as possible. No further complaint received. Noise from fans and motors of new boiler installation at laundry. The proprietor isolated the motors from the structure by use of vibration isolation mats and provided flexible connections to the fan units, on request. Nuisance abated. Noises from ready mix concrete installation and general operations in builder's yard. After the service of Abatement Notices on them, and unsuccessful attempts to baffle noise by enclosing machinery, erecting baffle walls, etc. the firm transferred its business to other premises. Noise from Radio Repair Shop. After numerous complaints from the tenant of the flat over the shop and after several hours of observation at various times of the day and night, particularly on Saturdays, sufficient evidence was collected to warrant the service of an Abatement Notice. The tenant then vacated the flat. A new tenant moved in and has not found the noise a nuisance. This is an indication of the difficulty likely to arise in proving to the Magistrates that a noise is, in fact, a nuisance. What is a nuisance and a genuine disturbance to one person can go practically Unnoticed by another. "Noise from pump at night". The complaint was investigated at night and found to be coming from a building site in an adjoining area. The complaint was referred to the local authority concerned, shortly after which the nuisance was abated. Noise from coaches arriving at garage late at night and leaving in early morning. Investigation showed that vehicles were stopped some distance from the garage and left by the drivers whilst they attended at the office. On returning to the vehicles these were started again and the engines "revved" before moving off. This was stopped, reducing the cause for complaint. Later the garage was transferred to another area. 72 Noise from alarm bell on jib crane on building site. Investigation showed that the bell sounded when the crane was overloaded. The builders were requested to take proper steps to see that the crane was not overloaded. Greater care was taken and no further complaints were received. Noise from work carried out in all-night garage. A call bell rung by cars passing over cables on entering the garage was muffled, the doors of the workshop were kept closed as much as possible and unnecessary shouting by employees eliminated after representations by the Public Health Inspector keeping observation. Beyond that, it was not possible to state that the "best practicable means" of abating the nuisance had not been taken, the other noises being those from the normal running of a garage. Although the complaints continued no further action was possible Noise from six-way cutting machine in joinery shop Extensive sound-proofing works were carried out to the building and the nuisance reduced to a minimum. Noise from movement of hydraulic jacks about a factory and excessive noise from factory radio. The radio was successfully dealt with by reducing the volume, but no practicable steps appeared to be possible to reduce the noise from the jacks. Noise from children entering and leaving school and during break-time The school was on a busy main road and it was not considered that the noise of the children, at the times when it occurred, was sufficiently above the general background of noise of the district to be a nuisance liable to be dealt with under the Act. Noise from building operations at premises It was established that the work was being carried out with unnecessary noise. The builder was requested to stop this and did so. Noise from compressor at laundry The compressor was resited in another part of the premises where it did not cause nuisance to surrounding householders. Noise from handling and hammering of metals in factory The lay-out of the factory was altered so as to take the operation further away from surrounding dwelling-houses. This reduced, but did not eliminate the 73 noise, but as the premises are due for demolition in the near future it was considered that the high cost of sound-proofing the building was not warranted. Ice-Cream Vendors. Three successful prosecutions were taken against mobile ice-cream vendors for sounding a "loudspeaker" (chimes) after 7.0 p.m. Dwellinghouses. "Tenants noisy at night" The Public Health Inspector interviewed the tenants complained of and this apparently resulted in an improvement as no further complaints were received. Such nuisances are, however, in my opinion best left to be dealt with by private action. It is not sound practice to utilise the services of a professional officer for some hours every evening for, perhaps, weeks on end to hang around trying to obtain evidence of a nuisance which only affects very few people. The Noise abatement Act provides that three occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a nuisance may take similar action under the Act to that open to a local authority, and I consider that private complaints of this kind are best left to the complainants who can collect the necessary evidence and proceed privately for a remedy. One tenant of a house deliberately making noise to annoy another. In this case the complainant was advised to consult her own solicitor who would, no doubt, if he considered it necessary, apply for an injunction to restrain the other tenant from causing a nuisance. A number of complaints of noisy animals and radios at privpte premises were referred to the Town Clerk for action under the Council's Good Rule and Government Byelaws. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACTS Foot and Mouth Disease Swine Fever No outbreaks of these diseases in or near the Borough during the year so that it did not become necessary at any time to place restrictions on the movement of animals. FOWL PEST Fowl Pest was discovered at two premises at Mill Hill early in the year. Some 210 fowls were destroyed, the poultry houses and runs cleansed and disinfected, 74 and the movement of poultry in the area restricted for a period of 28 days. No further outbreaks occurred. THE MOVEMENT OP ANIMALS (RECORDS) ORDERS. 1960 & 1961 Detailed records have to be kept by stockholders of the movement of bovines, sheep, goats and pigs to and from their premises. These records are necessary so that in the event of outbreaks of foot-andmouth and other infectious diseases, investigations can be made at the premises from which any animals have recently been received. Animals which have left the premises can also be traced and kept under observation. All stockholders were visited during the year to ensure that the proper records were being kept. The records showed that the following stock was held in the Borough:- Pigs Bovines 670 365 Diseases of Animals (Waste Pood) Order, 1957 Once again during the year the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Pood urged the need for care in the handling of waste foods and swill to minimise the risk of spread of animal diseases. There has been increasing evidence that outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever and fowl pest are being caused by animals and poultry gaining access, either to raw foodstuffs or to waste which had not been properly boiled. The Diseases of Animals (Waste Pood) Order, 1957 prohibits the feeding of unboiled waste food to farm animals and poultry and requires that all such food shall be boiled for at least one hour in plant licensed by the Local Authority. Ten licences were originally issued under the Order but only five plants now remain in use. These are all visited by the Public Health Inspectors from time to time to ensure that the licence conditions are being complied with. One infringement was noted and dealt with. Importation of Dogs and Cats Order, 1928 There is an establishment at Mill Hill licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and used for the detention and isolation of imported dogs undergoing quarantine. 75 The establishment is run by veterinary surgeons and is licensed for the detention of 35 dogs at any one time. During the year, 80 dogs were received at the premises after being authorised to land in this country. The dogs are kept strictly isolated from all other dogs during the six months period of quarantine. The premises are kept under observation by the Police and the Council' s Disease of Animals Inspector to check on the presence and isolation of the dogs. As a result of careful and strict observance of the Importation Order, no rabies has been confirmed in this country since 1922. 76 SECTION E FOOD ADMINISTRATION INSPECTION OP FOOD PREMISES POOD & DRUGS ACT 1955 POOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 The following table classifies the various premises in the Borough at which food is manufactured, prepared or sold, and shows the number of inspections and re-inspections made by the Public Health Inspectors. Premises Inspections Re-inspections Bakehouses 25 43 19 Bakers and Confectioners 37 36 24 Butchers 97 271 235 Caterers Production Kitchen 1 11 Confectioners (Sweets) 153 120 33 Dairies & Milk Distributors 56 43 18 Fishmongers 32 60 50 Greengrocers & Fruiterers 108 87 124 Grocers & Provisions Merchants 171 197 151 Hawkers' Storage premises 12 36 2 Hotels, Restaurants & Cafes 132 156 219 Ice Cream - Premises registered for manufacture or sale 245 364 127 Licensed Premises 50 128 208 Preserved Foods - Premises registered for (a) Preparation of Sausages 13 105 34 (b) Brining of Meat 63 (c) Frying of fish 11 School Meals Kitchens and Centres 52 38 16 Works Canteens 62 56 14 77 WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT During the year the following works, etc. were carried out at the abovementioned premises in response to notices served or requests made verbally by the Public Health Inspectors. The institution of legal proceedings for failure to comply with the Act or Regulations did not become necessary during the year. Decorations of Shops, Storerooms etc. 116 General Repairs 38 Floor finishes or coverings renewed 27 Ventilation improved 4 Sanitary Accommodation - Repairs 48 Redecoration 60 "Now Wash Your Hands" notices displayed 34 Personal Washing facilities improved 54 Refuse bins renewed 22 Drains repaired or cleared 12 Refrigerators repaired 17 Equipment renewed 37 Unsuitable Brining Containers renewed 11 Protection provided to Food on Display 10 First Aid Materials Renewed 18 Lockers provided for Outdoor Clothing 9 Accumulations of Rubbish removed 28 Vermin infestations dealt with 4 Dirty conditions improved 24 Miscellaneous contraventions remedied 12 NEW PREMISES An arrangement exists whereby all plans deposited with the Borough Engineer & Surveyor for new food premises or for alterations to existing premises are passed to the Chief Public Health Inspector for his observations in connection with the enactments which will apply when the premises become occupied. This co-operation has resulted in many improvements in design, lay-out and equipment being incorporated in the work, so raising the general standard of hygiene at the premises and avoiding the possible necessity of the Public Health Inspector having to ask for additional works or the provision of additional equipment etc., when the premises have come into use and subject to the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. 78 The arrangement is welcomed by the shop-keepers and their Architects, the Public Health Inspectors, as a result of their experience in dealing with the different types of food premises, often being in a position to make recommendations which not only improve the standard of hygiene but also give better working conditions at the premises. COMPLAINTS OF FOREIGN MATTER IN FOODS Nineteen complaints were made to the Department during the year and below are details of the action taken. Complaint Action Selling two packets of Vienna sausages later found to be partially in a state of putrefaction. There appeared to be no neglect on the part of the retailer. The sausages were manufactured in Dublin and outside the jurisdiction of the English Courts. Warning letters were sent to both manufacturer and retailer. Selling confectionery which had been nibbled by mice. Legal proceedings taken against retailers for selling food unfit for human consumption under Section 8, Food and Drugs Act, 1955. The defendants pleaded guilty and the Magistrates imposed a fine of £20 and awarded the Council £5.5.0d. costs. Selling pork pie containing mould growth. The pie appeared to have been kept too long on the retailer's premises. Legal proceedings were accordingly taken against the retailers who pleaded guilty. The Magistrates imposed a fine of £5 and awarded the Council £5.5.0d. costs. Selling sliced and wrapped loaf found to contain mould growth. The loaf, which had been set aside for return to the manufacturer was accidentally sold by an assistant. The retailer had only recently commenced business and the case was dealt with by sending him a warning letter. Selling chocolate gateau containing mould growth. This cake was also said to have been set aside as "stale" for return to the manufacturer, but had inadvertantly been sold. As there had been previous complaints regarding food supplied by the retailer, legal proceedings were taken. The Magistrates imposed a fine of £10 and awarded the Council £5.5.0d. costs. 79 Soiling a wrapped sliced loaf containing fragments of a black substance. The loaf was sent to the Public Analyst who reported that the black substance was charred dough and harmless. No further action was taken. Selling bottle of orange drink containing metal bottle cap. In a similar case, which was taken to the High Court on appeal, a summons was dismissed on the grounds that the cap was sterile and that the substance of the (in that case) milk was not affected by its presence. It was accordingly decided to take no further action. Selling wrapped sliced loaf found to contain spots of mould. The loaf was baked on a Friday and delivered to the retailer early on the Saturday. It was delivered by a roundsman to the complainant on the same day but not opened for use until the Monday evening. The period between purchase and examination precluded the taking of legal proceedings and the case was dealt with by warning letters to retailer and manufacturer. Selling pair of kippers unfit for human consumption. As some 20 hours elapsed between the time of sale and the kippers being handed in to the Department, it was difficult to assess their condition at the time of sale, particularly as the weather was warm at the time. The retailer's premises were visited and all stock checked. No other complaints were received and it was accordingly considered that no further action could be taken. Selling bread roll containing part of razor blade. Legal proceedings were instituted against the retailers who were also the manufacturers. They pleaded guilty and the Magistrates imposed a fine of £20. and awarded the Council 5 guineas costs. Selling loaf alleged to contain parts of a cockroach. The part of the cockroach was not found until the loaf has been in use 3 days. It showed no evidence of adhesions of dough such as might have been expected had the cockroach been present in the dough during baking. 80 Selling loaf alleged to contain parts of a cockroach - cont. At our request the Chief Public Health Inspector to the Local authority concerned inspected the bakehouse and found no evidence of infestation. He also reported that the proprietor had a contract with a leading firm of disinfestors to keep the premises free from all pests and vermin. In all the circumstances it was decided to take no further action. Selling a loaf containing small pieces of rubber. The rubber was considered to be part of a seal from a machine newly installed by the millers. The problem had not been foreseen and steps were taken to prevent a recurrence. In the circumstances, the case was dealt with by a warning letter to the manufacturer who has previously had a good record. Selling a loaf with a small insect embedded in the outside of the crust. The local authority in whose area the bakery was situated was asked to investigate. They reported that the bakery was scrupulously clean, equipped with modern machinery and well managed. Its output was approximately 8,000 loaves per hour per 144 hour week. They considered that the insect, which was winged, had settled in a bakery tin immediately before the dough being placed in it. As the insect was tiny and as the manufacturer had a previous good record, the case was dealt with by sending a warning letter to him. Selling dried apricots containing small insects. The insects which were about 1/8 inch in length were identified as "Dried Fruit Beetle" and were hidden in the folds of the apricots. The fruit was imported from California and the insects must have been present in the fruit when it came into this country. The consignment was withdrawn from sale and the matter taken up with the importers. As it would have been extremely difficult for the retailer to detect the insects and as the fruit 81 Selling dried apricots containing small insects - cont. would in any case be washed before being consumed, the case was dealt with by a warning letter to the retailer. Selling wrapped and sliced loaf containing small quantity of grease. The grease was about 1/4 inch square and concentrated in the centre of two slices. The Public Analyst confirmed that it was machine oil probably from the dough-making machinery, Although aesthetically unpleasant it was harmless. There were no known previous convictions against the manufacturers and in the circumstances it was decided to deal with the case by the issue of a warning letter. Selling wrapped sliced loaf with spots of mould on one side. The amount of mould was small and there was a good deal of conflicting evidence between purchaser, retailer and manufacturer. As both retailer and manufacturer had a good record it was decided only to issue warning letters to both. Sale of wrapped sliced brown loaf affected by mould. Enquiries elicited the fact that after purchase the bread had been stored for 48 hours in an unventilated wall cupboard over a gas-heated refrigerator in the purchaser's kitchen. As this would promote mould growth it was decided to deal with the case only by way of warning letters to retailer and manufacturer. Presence of cigarette end in fish fillets. The circumstances were that after purchasing a plaice the customer asked for it to be filleted. The assistant accordingly took the fish to the preparing room at the rear of the shop and whilst he was there the purchaser called to him that she would like the bones. By then they had been thrown into the waste bin. He recovered them and wrapped them with the fish. When the purchaser unwrapped the fish at home she discovered the cigarette end lying on top of the fish with the bones. The bones should, of course, have been 82 Presence of cigarette end in fish fillets - cont. wrapped separately but in view of the retailer's previous very good record it was decided in the somewhat unusual circumstances to deal with the case by means of a warning letter. Selling bacon found to contain a number of maggots. A joint of Swedish half-shoulder bacon was purchased and found to contain a number of dead maggots. The retailer (and importers) outlined the steps taken by them to treat the bales of sides of bacon they receive to protect the sides against flies. The insecticide used had evidently killed the larvae on hatching. The problem of protecting meat at all stages against flies is formidable and in view of the previous good record of the retailers the case was dealt with by the issue of a warning letter. CONDEMNED POODS A list of the foodstuffs condemned by the Public Health Inspectors during the year as unfit for human consumption is given below. It is rarely nowadays that an inspector finds unsound food displayed or intended for sale. All of the food detailed below was condemned as a result of requests received from retailers to inspect the food which had become unfit from such causes as breakdown of refrigerators at week-ends or delay or damage in transit. Condemned foods are destroyed by incineration at the Council's Refuse Disposal Works. LIST OP FOODSTUFFS CONDEMNED DURING 1962 Meat 501 lbs 3 ozs (including Beef, Pork, Veal, Chicken, Rabbit, Offal, Sausages, Sausage Meat, Corned Beef, Ox Tongues) 2¼ lbs Veal Pie Fish 1 stone Kipper 2 stones Soft Roes 83 Tinned Foods Cream 1 Pish 33 Fruit 543 Fruit Juice 41 Ham 17 (151 lbs 10 ozs) Jam 9 Meat 76 Milk 10 Paste 1 Puddings 17 Soup 10 Tomato Juice 1 Vegetables 203 Miscellaneous Goods Apricots (dried) 22½ lbs Biscuits ½ lb Butter 16 lbs Jam 60 jars Margarine 14 lbs Pickles 7 jars Rice Pudding 1 pkt Frozen Foods Cakes 111 Cannelloni 3 pkts Chickens 7 " Dinners 42 " Eclairs 2 " Fish 404 " Fruit 21 " Ice Cream 153 " Meat 271 " Mousse 256 " Pastries 49 ,, Pies 63 " Potato Chips 1° " 84 Sausages l pkt Sausage Rolls 9 .. Vegetables 724 " Yorkshire Puddings 9 " The amount of food condemned was substantially less than in previous years. POOD POISONING - SAMPLES The following samples were taken, either in connection with the investigation of food poisoning or suspected food poisoning outbreaks or as routine sampling of foods found in the past to have been associated with such outbreaks. Desiccated Coconut 14 Chinese Egg Albumin 4 Marzipan 1 Peanut Butter 1 Cashew Nuts 1 Clotted Cream 1 Chocolate Eclair 1 Cold Roast Chicken 1 Cheese Spread 1 Danish Rye Bread 1 In no case, however, was any food poisoning organism found. In 1961, a number of samples of coconut were found to contain such organisms, but the stricter bacteriological control of imports undertaken at the port of entry and the improved methods adopted by the Ceylonese producers have apparently not been without success. The following were also taken in connection with a survey being carried out by the Central Public Health Laboratory Service to determine the proportion of poultry on retail sale infected with food poisoning organisms and the extent of the risk of cross-contamination to other foods. Swabs from uneviscerated poultry - Chickens Turkeys Ducks Satisfactory 39 11 62 Unsatisfactory 7 _ 26 85 The importance of a high standard of hygiene in butchers' s or poulterers' shops handling uneviscerated ducks is evident. These were all visited by the Public Health Inspectors and the need stressed for this to be carried out on a seperated bench or table with equipment kept for this purpose, by an employee wearing a washable apron used only when engaged on this work, to be so engaged only when free from other duties in or about the shop, and to pay strict attention to washing and scrubbing of hands and sterilisation of benches and equipment after the work has been completed. Forty-four samples of minced meat, sausage meat, offal, etc., were also taken. Three of these contained food poisoning organisms and special attention was given to the possibility of cross-contamination from poultry handling. MILK & DAIRIES (GENERAL) REGULATIONS The large milk bottling establishment at Claremont Road, NW.2. was frequently inspected during the year and 130 bottles were taken at random from the bottle-washing machines after having been subjected to the washing and sterilising processes. The bottles were subjected to bacteriological examination with the following results:- Satisfactory 119 Unsatisfactory 11 Ten of the unsatisfactory samples were school milk bottles which appear to give more trouble than the ordinary pint bottle. The bottles go through a sevenstage washer, which includes three detergent washes, the final wash reaching a temperature of 71° C. It is rarely that an unsatisfactory result is reported on a pint bottle sample but school milk bottles, despite the special attention given to them by the Dairy Company, do occasionally show unsatisfactory results. The Company attributes this to the facts that a) school milk bottles are rarely rinsed after use b) these bottles have a longer life than pint bottles, the percentage of breakages being much lower. This renders them more liable to chipping or roughening of the internal surfaces due to mis-use and so more prone to build-up of contamination. c) mis-use of such bottles is not uncommon, a variety of objects being recovered from them on return, including plants, earth and coloured sand. 86 The fact that a bacteriological report on a sample records it is unsatisfactory does not necessarily mean that it is injurious to health, but the presence of any abnormal number of bacteria, however harmless, is an indication that the washing processes are not producing in the bottle that degree of cleanliness approaching sterility which is desirable. It is understood that pilot schemes are now being conducted in Middlesex, Surrey and the London County Council area with the use of tetrapac cartons in schools, Por older children, who can be relied upon to open the cartons without difficulty or spilling, this method of using a non-returnable container is, from a public health viewpoint, greatly to be preferred. On one occasion during the year it was necessary to send a warning letter to the firm concerned regarding a bottle of milk delivered to a customer in Tottenham, the bottle having in the interior some brown stairing which had not been removed in the washing processes. During the year, three new registrations were made of distributors of milk from retail premises and two were removed from the register, the sale of milk having been discontinued. The total number of registered premises at the end of the year was accordingly 51, ten being depots from which milk is distributed by roundsmen and 41 being retail shops. The premises were inspected and eight works were required which included repairs, redecoration, provision of "Now Wash Your Hands" notices in waterclosets, improved ventilation and adequate protection of foodstuffs exposed for sale. Two samples of milk were taken from a vending machine which had previously not been operating satisfactorily but the results of the samples were good. Routine sampling of milk is now carried out by Middlesex County Council. ICE CREAM At the end of the year there were 245 premises registered for the sale or manufacture of ice cream. 23 new registrations were made during the year, eight registrations were transferred to new occupiers, and ten registrations were revoked, the sale of ice cream having been discontinued. Ice cream is also sold at several hotels, restaurants and cinemas. These premises are not subject to registration 271 samples of ice cream were taken and submitted to the central Public Health Laboratory Service for bacteriological examination and grading according to the Ministry of Health's Provisional Grading Scheme, with the following results:- 87 Grades 1 and 2 are satisfactory. Grade 3 calls for Investigationof the methods of production and/or handling. Grade 4 is unsatisfactory. No. of Samples Results taken Prepacked 103 Grade 1 4 "2 - " 3 - " 4 Ice Lollies 36 "1 (Semi-wrapped) 1 " 2 - " 3 - ,, 4 Loose 39 ,, 1 24 " 2 26 " 3 24 " 4 Soft Ice 5 " 1 4 " 2 2 " 3 3 ,, 4 271 The results show that prepacked ice cream and ice lollies are of excellent bacteriological standard. The high percentage of poor results of samples of loose ice cream was largely due to a series of unsatisfactory samples from two manufacturers delivering supplies to restaurants in the Borough. The matter was taken up with the local authorities of the areas concerned and eventually better results were obtained. In a few instances other poor results were found to be due to failure to keep the servers in a proper sterilant solution whilst not in use. The unsatisfactory results obtained from samples of soft ice cream taken towards the end of the summer season when this type of ice cream was gaining popularity, indicate the need for attention in 1963 to the mobile vans from which the greater proportion of this type of ice cream appears to be sold. 88 BUTCHERS' SHOPS All 98 butchers' shops In the Borough were thoroughly inspected during the year. At 68, matters were found requiring attention which included repair, redecoration, renewal of equipment, lack of proper cleanliness, unsatisfactory storage of refuse, inadequate use of protection of meat and other foods against contamination, insufficient use if protective clothing and separation of processes, e. g. evisceration of poultry from places where meat is stored and handled. Most of these matters had received attention by the end of the year. It was disappointing to note that at no less than 62 premises the use of sawdust on floors is still practised This introduces hygienic risks and should be avoided. Unless properly damped and sprinkled with care on the floor, and particularly well damped again before sweeping up there is a danger of dust rising and contaminating any exposed meat, chopping blocks, counters, etc. When it dries during the day it can also be raised in the form of dust by the feet of customers. It may also be used to cover floors that have not been properly cleansed. A hard-core of proprietors and managers, however, insist that the use of sawdust is essential to provide a non-slip surface and to act as a floor dressing to take up any moisture from the meat dripping on to it. Non-slip floors can, however, be provided by the use of granolithic incorporating carborundum, and other surfaces have proved quite satisfactory in shops where the use of sawdust would not be tolerated. Hygienists have been campaigning for years to abolish the use of sawdust and it is to be hoped that when next the Pood Hygiene Regulations are revised this abolition will be achieved. A copy of the Pood Hygiene Code of Practice for Hygiene in the Retail Meat Trade, produced by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Pood, was handed to each proprietor or manager, and, where they were willing to display them, notices asking customers to kindly refrain from bringing their dogs into the shops. PREMISES REGISTERED FOR PREPARATION OP MANUFACTURE OF SAUSAGES OR POTTED, PRESSED, PICKLED OR PRESERVED FOOD INTENDED FOR SALE At the end of the year 96 premises were registered for the following purposes: Brining of meat 75 Boiling of Hams 7 Cooking and/or pressing of Meat 4 89 Preparation of Sausages 8 Preparation of " Hot-Dogs" 1 Roasting of Chickens 6 Preparation of Meat Pies 1 Frying of Fish 10 Curing of Fish 4 (Some premises are registered for more than one purpose) Thirty new registrations were made during the year, ten were transferred to new occupiers and 25 premises were removed from the register. 105 inspections and 34 re-inspections were carried out. At 25 premises various matters were found requiring attention, i.e. repairs, redecoration, washing facilities for staff not being properly maintained, equipment renewal, and brine not being kept at adequate strength. These matters were dealt with without recourse to statutory action. HAWKERS Hawkers of food in the Borough are required to be registered with the Council under Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950. Before an application for registration is granted the van is inspected for suitability, the storage premises checked and the source of the food supplies investigated. At the close of the year there were 44 hawkers on the register, being registered for the sale of - Greengrocery and Fruit 31 Fish 4 Ice Cream 5 Eggs 1 Shellfish 1 Confectionery 1 Tea and Cakes etc. 1 During the year six new registrations were made, and 27 names were removed from the register it having been ascertained that the hawkers were no longer 90 trading in the Borough. Sixty-two inspections or re-inspections were made of vans but the only matters found requiring attention were - Name and address not legibly inscribed on van 5 Repairs to vehicle required 2 These matters were dealt with. LICENSED PREMISES Inspections were carried out of the 50 licensed hotels, restaurants and Public Houses in the Borough and reports submitted to the Licensing Justices on the conditions found. These reports are considered by the Justices at the Brewster Sessions when applications for renewal of existing, or for new licences, are dealt with. This is an annual procedure. Twenty-three of the premises were found to be satisfactory. At the other 27 premises the following works were found to be necessary. Bars or Dining Booms Repairs 5 Redecoration 15 Food Stores or Cellars Repairs 1 Redecoration 7 Cloakrooms, Pas sages, etc., Redecoration 5 Kitchens Repairs 5 Redecoration 5 Repair of refrigerator 3 Repair or renewal of equipment 6 Cleansing of equipment 6 91 Personal Washing Facilities Not properly maintained 2 Sanitary Conveniences Repairs 15 Redecoration 17 Cleansing 2 Refuse Bins Unsatisfactory 5 Apart from a few instances where the necessary works were forming part of reconstruct ion programmes, the works had been completed by the end of the year. LICENSING ACT, 1961 Registration of Clubs This Act, the final part of which came into operation on 1st. March, 1962, amended the general law on licensing and contains special provisions relating to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor in clubs. A new system of registration of these clubs was introduced, each club being required to apply for registration to the Magistrates Court. Registration is for 12 months save that on the second or subsequent renewal this may be extended to a period not exceeding 10 years. The Magistrates may refuse an application either for the issue or renewal of a registration certificate on a number of grounds listed in the Act. On receipt of an application for registration the Clerk of the Justices is required to send forthwith a copy to the Clerk of the Local Authority, and the Local Authority may, within 28 days, object to the application being granted. Power of entry to inspect the premises is given to a local authority's authorised officers. The Public Health Inspectors were accordingly appointed " authorised officers" and as copies of applications were received they proceeded to inspect the premises ascertain whether, so far as the Department is concerned, " the premises are suitable and convenient for the purpose in view of their character and condition and the size and nature of the club". Attention was paid to the following:- Meetings Rooms, Bars, etc , Condition of ceilings, walls, floor, iture and fittings, means of natural and artificial lighting and of ventilation. 92 Sanitary Accommodation Adequacy, suitability, accessibility, rection notices and condition. Washing Facilities Adequacy, suitability, (lavatory basin with (Personal) hot and cold water supplies, soap, towels etc.,) Washing Arrangements (Glasses) Provision of proper facilities. Food Condition of preparation room - lighting, ventilation, suitability, cleanliness, provision of proper equipment. Adequate and proper storage facilities. Proper washing facilities for equipment. Crockery & Glasses Condition General Sanitation Condition of drains, pavings, refuse receptacles, etc., Forty-nine premises were inspected Nineteen were found to be satisfactory. At the otner thirty the following matters were found requiring attention:- Meeting Rooms, Bars, Etc. Repairs 2 Redecoration 12 Renewal of floor covering 5 Inadequate ventilation 1 Unsatisfactory glass washing facilities 2 General cleaning 1 Renewal of sink 1 Renewal of other equipment 1 Sanitary Accommodation Inadequate ventilation 2 Inadequate artificial lighting 4 Repairs 7 Redecoration 5 Renewal of fittings 3 Not properly indicated for sexes 2 Not available at all times 1 " Now Wash Your Hands" notices not displayed in those used by persons handling food 17 93 Personal Washing Facilities Inadequate 14 Kitchens Inadequate lighting 1 Inadequate ventilation 2 Repairs 7 Redecoration 9 Renewal of floor covering 7 Renewal of sinks 4 Renewal of other equipment 8 Insufficient hot water supplies 2 Inadequate washing facilities 3 Inadequate first aid equipment 3 Food Stores Insufficient 1 Redecoration 7 Refuse Receptacles Insufficient 2 No paved standings 2 Drains Repairs 5 Cleansing 2 Rubbish Accumulation 1 In most cases the necessary works were carried out before the hearing of applications by the Magistrates. In others, where the mere extensive works were required, and as this was the first inspection requiring the premises to be brought up to a proper standard, suitable undertakings were accepted to carry out the work within prescribed periods. These were all honoured and in no case did it become necessary to object to the granting of a licence. SCHOOL MEALS KITCHENS AND CENTRES Swabs from utensils and crockery after washing Samples of washing and rinse waters The work, commenced in 1961, of checking the efficiency of the methods of washing and sterilising crockery and utensils in canteen kitchens and centre was 94 continued throughout the year. Twenty-nine were visited and swabs taken of 435 dinner plates, spoons and forks after washing and sterilising. These were submitted to bacteriological examination and it is satisfying to record that only ten of these were unsatisfactory. This was a decided improvement on those taken in 1961. When unsatisfactory results are obtained the methods of washing and sterilising are checked by the Public Health Inspectors and the swabbing repeated until satisfactory results are produced. Of 35 samples of washing water taken, twelve were found to have a high bacterial content. On checking this was found to be due to - (a) as much waste food as is reasonably possible not being scraped from plates etc., before they are placed in the washing water. If undue quantities are allowed to enter the water the action of the steriliser is expended in dealing with the bacterial content of these instead of acting on the utensils. (b) washing water being allowed to remain in use too long before changing and not being at a suitable temperature. (c) the correct quantity of detergent/steriliser not being added. All 35 samples of rinse water taken were, however, satisfactory, which indicates the value of sterilising sinks. In these the crockery and utensils are placed, in racks or trays, in water at a temperature of about 82 °C. This not only destroys any bacteria remaining on the articles but also raises the articles to a temperature which renders cloth-drying, with its risk of re-contamination, unnecessary. FOOD AND DRUGS SAMPLING I am indebted to Mr. John O'Keefe, O.B.E., Chief Officer, Public Control Department, Middlesex County Council for the following report on the work carried out by his Department in the Borough of Hendon in the sampling of food and drugs and in the administration of the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 - 1953 and the Labelling of Pood Order, 1953 " Samples procured in the Borough of Hendon during the year 1962 - Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 24 3 Milk (evaporated) 1 - Butter 47 - Cakes and Biscuits 3 - Cream 20 - 95 Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Cheese 6 1 Drugs 51 1 Pish and Fish Products 32 1 Fruit (fresh and canned) 33 - Fruit (dried and preserved) 9 1 Ice Cream 21 - Lard 5 - Liver 15 - Margarine 17 - Meat and Meat Products 105 2 Sausages 2 - Soft Drinks and Fruit Juices 4 - Sweets 3 - Spirits 12 - Vinegar 65 - Miscellaneous 22 1 TOTALS 497 10 With regard to those samples noted in the table as unsatisfactory I have the following comments:- MILK The three samples of milk not satisfactory were all procured from cafes. One sample was found to be slightly deficient in solids-not-fat and attempts were therefore made on several later occasions to procure further samples. On each occasion the cafe refused to serve hot milk and no action was therefore possible. Two samples of hot milk were procured from another cafe both of which were found to contain added water. It was found that the cafe did not normally sell hot milk but produced them to oblige the customer. The added water was introduced because cold milk was taken from stock and was heated on a steam injector. There was in fact no other way at this cafe of heating milk. Steam injection it is found normally causes about 10% of water to be added to milk during the heating process. Having had regard to the circumstances of these particular samples the County Council instructed that a caution be sent to the cafe proprietor. CHEESE A sample labelled by a retailer as "French Cream Cheese" was procured which on analysis was found to contain 27.98% of milk-fat. It is considered that a cheese 96 should contain at least 50% of milk-fat. The cheese (which was sold in a package bearing no statement in English) was not in fact a Cream Cheese and was not intended by the importers to be sold. On investigation it appeared that the retailer had presumed from the statement in French on the label 60% fat in dry matter, that the cheese was one which could properly described as Cream Cheese. Although the cheese did in fact contain 60% of fat in the dry matter, because it also contained 54% of water the actual fat present in the sample was 27.98%. The retailer was sent a letter of caution, and the import ers were required to label the cheese so as to conform with the statutory requirements. DRUGS It will be recalled that as a result of representations made by you during the previous year, a sample of tablets containing sodium fluoride was procured from a chemist in your Borough. A further sample of these tablets was procured during the year now under review and although the quantity of sodium fluoride was greater than in the sample previously procured it was not in accordance with the formula printed on the label. It was found on investigations that the packer had in the interim period ordered the manufacture of the tablets from a different source from that from which the original sample was procured. The new manufacturer had not fully appreciated the problems involved in the manufacture of this product and had in fact used sodium fluoride of 95% purity in the manufacture of the tablets. This had not been taken into account in manufacturing the tablets and in declaring the quantity of sodium fluoride on the label and as a result the tablets were deficient of the stated quantity of sodium fluoride. Because it was considered that the efficacy of the tablets was not impaired it was decided not to prosecute, and a caution was sent to the packer. FISH For selling smoked cod when smoked haddock was asked for, a fishmonger in your Borough was sent a caution. The purchaser was served by an elderly assistant who was helping out at a time of difficulty in the retail shop. MEAT Two samples of minced beef procured from a retail butchers shop were found to contain sulphur dioxide which is a preservative not permitted in this class of meat product. In respect of one of the samples, which was found to contain 1,014 parts per million of sulphur dioxide the butcher was prosecuted and was fined £5 and was ordered to pay £6.8.0d. towards the cost. MISCELLANEOUS A sample of "Butter Milk Drink* was procured from a retailer in your District. The sample on analysis was found to contain 0.1% of butter-fat. It was considered that the label on the product was misleading because the words * butter" and "milk" were separated. In fact the sample was one of " Buttermilk-Drink". Buttermilk is 97 a well-known term which describes the liquid which remains after the abstraction of milk-fat from soured cream by churning. The manufacturer agreed to correct his labels, and the offence was dealt with by sending him a letter of warning. EXAMINATION OF FOODSTUFFS In addition to samples purchased in the Borough, labelled stacks and displays of fish (84), meat (55), apples (104), citrus fruit (165), vegetables (21), offal (58), and other miscellaneous foods (17), were examined in 221 shops. Formal samples are selectively procured from retail shops based on these examinations of labelled displays natural foods where there is doubt as to the accuracy of the label or where there is need for further examination. The Inspectors of the Department have, over a number of years, acquired a considerable expertise in the identification of cuts of meat and of varieties of fish and fruit. The sample of fish referred to above was purchased as a result of such examination. NEW LEGISLATION In 1962 new regulations were introduced dealing with emulsifiers and stabilizers in food, and with preservatives in food In addition there has been an amended Food Standard relating to table jellies. The effect of the regulations dealing with emulsifiers and stabilizers and with preservatives is to define and limit the additives which are permitted, and (in the case of preservatives), to extend the range of foods and the types of preservatives which are allowed but nevertheless closely limiting the quantities of such preservatives. No infringement arising from the new regulations has been reported during the year. THE MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS, 1887-1953 Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of the origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 335 premises, and 170 stacks and displays of meat, 493 of apples, 330 of tomatoes, 157 of poultry, and 6 of other miscellaneous foods were examined for compliances with the Orders. Minor infringements have been dealt with by verbal warnings. One more serious infringement resulted in the prosecution of a butcher. In this case it was found that English meat was correctly marked and that no imported meat was marked at all. The Magistrates gave the butcher a conditional discharge on payment of £5. 5. Od. towards the costs. SAFE MILK Thirty-seven samples of pasteurised or sterilized milk were procured from retailers in the Borough and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed. Forty-one inspections of premises were made to ensure that they conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. Two of the samples procured failed to satisfy the 98 methylene blue test for pasteurised milk. In respect of each failure the retailers concerned were sent the prescribed statutory warning notice. Five samples of raw milk were procured and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All five were satisfactory THE LABELLING OP POOD ORDER, 1953 This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. A total of 299 premises were visited in connection with the Order, and 1,111 articles of food have been examined. Arising from these examinations letters of warning were sent to an importer who described a fish product imported by him as "Herring Fillets in Beer Sauce". Analytical tests showed that ethyl alcohol was not present in the sample, and the description was therefore considered to be inaccurate. The label of this product did not disclose the ingredients of which it was composed. The importer promised to correct the label without delay. A sample of imported rasberry syrup was found to contain a permitted added colouring. This fact was not disclosed on the label. Correction of the label was secured. LABELLING AND ADVERTISING INFRINGEMENTS A considerable amount of work was done in the year which, while it did not arise from samples and inspections in the area of Hendon nevertheless has the effect of protecting the residents of your county district. The matters mentioned below were of nationally retailed articles of food, which are widely distributed throughout the County. Several manufacturers and importers were reminded of the obligation to put on the labels of foods the name and address of the packer or labeller. Similar action was taken in respect of pickles, canned peas and mixed vegetables which did not bear a statement of ingredients. One manufacturer of ice cream was found to be putting all the statutory declarations on the base of the carton. He was reminded that these declarations are required to be both conspicuous and prominent. Two advertisements for honey did not disclose that the honeys offered were of foreign origin. The Merchandise Marks Act requires this, and letters were sent to the advertisers reminding them of their obligations to declare the origin in advertisements. Some prepacked lamb chops found to be generally on sale were of imported origin. The declaration in such a case is required to be half inch letters; The lettering used was so small as to be quite inconspicuous, and the packers were required to comply with the prescribed conditions. Matters dealt with under the Food and Drugs Act by correspondence included a sample of cream cheese containing less milk fat than was considered sufficient to 99 justify the title. Five examples of cake-mixes, which were not complete mixes in that other additions, such as egg or milk were necessary before the mix could be used, were found. The manufacturers were required prominently to show what additions were necessary. The manufacturers of four brands of milk pudding which were described on the label as "creamed rice" were challenged on the ground that the product was in fact a rice milk pudding and not creamed rice. Correction to the labels was secured. The manufacturer of a lemon juice was challenged that a claim on the label for slimming properties for the juice was not justified, and he amended his labels to delete the claim. A sample of cream was procured which was labelled "thick cream". The fat content of this cream was less than the standard prescribed for thick cream and the product was re-labelled "sterilised cream". A manufacturer of a canned meat product claimed on the label that it was "full of lean red meat", in fact, the meat content was no more than is normal for this class of product, and the manufacturer was therefore challenged as to the accuracy of the claim. It was withdrawn. It was claimed for a sample of chopped pork that it contained " more meat". In fact the percentage of meat was no greater than that of comparable products and the manufacturer was required to delete the claim. The manufacturers of several breakfast cereals were challenged on the ground that the labels claimed the foods to be "vitamin enriched". The vitamins present did not provide one half of the daily requirements which, it is considered, is the minimum to support claim to enrichment. The labels were amended to "vitamin fortified" which, because vitamins were added, was true. A sample of ice lollies for which it was claimed that glucose was present, was found on analysis not be to correct. The lollies originally it was found had been made with added glucose, but glucose had been dropped from the recipe. The label was not amended to conform to the new recipe, and was therefore incorrect. Reference to glucose was deleted from the new labels. A sample of butter mintoes was labelled "made with butter". This was not true; other fats were present as well; the label was amended after representations to the manufacturer to "contains butter". Two samples of instant coffee were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not at the time permitted in instant coffee. The manufacturers and importers concerned were sent letters of caution. Similar action was taken in respect of a sample of dried apricots which were found to contain sulphur dioxide. The quantity of preservative would have been satisfactory if its presence had been declared, and the manufacturers were required to amend the label. 100 A firm of confectionery importers was cautioned for selling sweets containing colouring matter not permitted. The firm had withdrawn from retailers sweets imported earlier, and had thought the stock from which the sample was procured was satisfactory. Only permitted colours are now used. During the year a manufacturer put on the market with a large scale newspaper advertising campaign a new product which consisted of 99% pure sugar with 1% of saccharin. It was claimed for this product that it was "Slimmers Sugar". The manufacturer was challenged on the ground that the product (because it contained saccharin) was not sugar. Exception was taken to advertising matter for the same reasons. Correction of advertising matter and the labels was secured, the manufacturer devising a new description for this product. An advertisement for vitamin capsules made extravagant claims. On being challenged, the advertisement and literature were modified so as to delete the objectionable wording used". 101 SECTION F Atmospheric Pollution SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Work proceeded steadily throughout the year In connected with the formation of smoke control areas under the Clean Air Act, 1956. The position at the end of the year was as follows;- Smoke Control Area No.l (Elstree and part of Edgware) The Order controlling this area came into operation on 1st September, 1960 but adaptations of fireplaces continued until June, 1961. The preparatory survey of the area showed that of the 658 properties in the area, adaptations were required at 122 at an estimated cost to the Council by way of grant of £1292.10.0. Actually only 48 householders claimed grant the total amount paid being £490.6.8. At the remaining 74 premises the position was in 1962 as follows:- 1. Work carried out but no grant claimed 9.5% 2. Work carried out but claims disallowed because work did not comply with conditions of grant 6.0% 3. Householders continuing to use existing un-approved type of solid fuel burning appliances usually with "premium" fuels 23.5% 4. Householders who converted to portable gas appliances 1.5% 5. Householders who converted to portable electrical appliances 36.0% 6. Householders who converted to portable oil burning appliances. 1.5% (Portable appliances do not rank for grants) 7. Houses where central heating installed but no claims for grants received. 22.0% Those householders relying on the fact that "premium" smokeless fuels can easily be burned in ordinary stool bottom grates may, if supplies of these fuels become not so readily available due to tne increase in the number of Smoke Control Areas, find thamselves in difficulty if they are at times able to obtain coke, which will not burn satisfactorily in these grates. 102 Smoke Control Area No.2 (Hampstead Garden Suburb). The Order controlling this area came into operation on 1st. October, 1962. The area contains 2,554 dwellings and 90 other premises. Adaptations to fireplaces were found to be necessary at 1273 dwellings at an estimated cost to the Council of £6532. Work was still proceeding at the end of the year, a number of householders finding difficulty in obtaining the services of contractors to execute the work. The Council have accordingly allowed until 30th June, 1963 for the submission of claims for grant. Prom the number of applications received for the approval of estimates, it is anticipated that 640 claims will be received, i.e. approximately 50% of the possible number. Others are known to have had work carried out without claiming grant so that it is likely that the final response to this Order will be an improvement on Area No.1. Smoke Control Area No.3 (Claremont Road Estate) The Order controlling this area came into operation on 1st. October, 1962. This is a small area made principally to enable adaptations which were necessary at the Council's Housing Estate at Claremont Road to be carried out with the benefit of 40% grant from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The total estimated cost of these works was £541. These works, and others at a few privately-owned dwellings in the area were satisfactorily completed by the end of the year. As in Area No.2, arrangements were made for the mobile exhibition unit of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation to visit the area. It spent two days there at various sites in October and demonstrated various types of solid smokeless fuel burning appliances in use. Technical specialists were in attendance to give advice on problems relating to the use of these fuels and were kept busily engaged doing so during the whole of the two days. Smoke Control Area No.U (West Hendon and The Hyde) This Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 27th. September, 1962 and comes into operation on 1st. October, 1963. This Order was made principally to cover the Council's The Hyde, Reet's Farm and Kingsbury Road housing estates where adaptations were necessary to 387 appliances at an estimated cost of £13,718. Adaptations were also necessary of 289 appliances in privately-owned dwellings at an estimated cost to the Council by the way of a grant of £375. 103 Work was proceeding satisfactorily at the end of the year. The existing properties in the West Hendon and The Hyde areas scheduled for redevelopment are exempt from the Order. Smoke Control Area No.5 (Clitterhouse Estate) This Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and local Government on 21st. November, 1962 and will come into operation on 1st. October, 1963. This Order was also made to cover a Council Housing Estate (Clitterhouse) where adaptations of 385 appliances were found to be necessary at an estimated cost of £18,539. It also covered the Railway cottages in Brent Terrace and a few other privatelyowned dwellings where adaptations were necessary at an estimated cost to the Council by way of grant of £589. Smoke Control Area No.6 (Granville Road and Cloister Road Estates) This Order was submitted to, and later confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. It will come into operation on 1st. October, 1963. Council-owned properties are again involved (Cloister Road Estate) where 215 appliances require adaptation at an estimated cost of £3,740. Work at privately-owned dwellings is estimated to cost the Council £201. Smoke Control Areas Nos.7 and 8 Work on the survey of these areas (Broadfields and Kenilworth Estates, Edgware) was proceeding at the end of the year. The Council continued its policy of making 100% grant where applied foi to Charitable and Religious Organisations, and to persons in receipt of retirement pensions or living on small fixed incomes, subject to the applications being approved by the Borough Treasurer. INDUSTRIAL PREMISES 465 observations were made by the Public Health Inspectors of the chimneys of industrial or commercial premises during the year. The number of emissions of smoke noted which contravened the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956 was relatively small and all were satisfactorily dealt with without recourse to statutory action. 104 BONFIRES Numerous enquiries were received from householders regarding the burning of garden rubbish in Smoke Control Areas. The position is that smoke from bonfires, if a nuisance to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, is, by virture of Section 16 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, a statutory nuisance liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act, 1936 irrespective of whether the bonfire is in a Smoke Control area or not. It follows, therefore, that bonfires should never be lighted on calm or foggy days but only when there is a fairly strong wind blowing which will quickly disperse the smoke without blowing it into adjoining properties so as to be a nuisance to the occupants. Materials should also be dried before burning so that the bonfire burns briskly and is not allowed to smoulder for prolonged periods. It is better to have small bonfires at more frequent intervals which are burned out quickly than large bonfires which might have a tendency to smoulder. Wherever possible, of course, disposal should be by composting. Several complaints were received regarding bonfires during the year. In all cases the offenders were interviewed by the Public Health Inspector of the district concerned and in no case was any recurrence noted which warranted statutory action. MEASUREMENT OP ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Measurements of the Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide contents of the atmosphere are taken by most local authorities in " black" areas at various sites in their areas in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Readings of the instruments are taken daily and the report submitted monthly to the Department. Published lists of the readings are then issued. By this means, not only can a local authority note the progress it is making in its efforts to produce a cleaner atmosphere but it can also make comparisons with local authorities of all types throughout the country. The relationship between air pollution and the incidence of respiratory and other diseases in an area can also be considered. The dust and grit which is sometimes emitted from industrial chimneys, whilst it may be a serious nuisance to the occupiers of premises on which it falls, is of no great significance to public health as the particles are too coarse to reach the human lung. The smoke, however, which is extracted from the atmosphere and measured in the smoke-measuring apparatus consists of very small particles, small enough to remain airborne indefinitely and capable of passing the natural defence mechanisms of the nose and throat and reaching the lungs. These particles come principally from the smoke of domestic chimneys burning bituminous fuel. For a period of 24 hours, air containing this smoke is drawn through a filter in the measuring apparatus upon which the particles are collected. The darkness 105 of the stain on the filter pad is then measured in a reflectometer and from this reading is calculated the concentration of smoke in the air. Sulphur dioxide, which is derived from the sulphur present in coal and in fuel oils, is an important gaseous pollutant and its measurement is recorded as, combined with smoke particles, it can seriously injure buildings and fabrics. There is, as yet, no known economical method available of removing sulphur from fuel or from flue gases. This Council operates three smoke measuring stations at sites approved by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, i.e., at Golders Green, Mill Hill and Edgware Branch Libraries. 106 SMOKE FILTER AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE STATION EDGWARE 1962 107 SMOKE FILTER AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE STATION GOLDERS GREEN 1962 108 SMOKE FILTER AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE STATION MILL HILL 1962 109 TABLE DAILY AVERAGE OP SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE AT EDGWARE MILL HILL AND GOLDERS GREEN MEASURING STATIONS (Microgrammes per cubic metre) Jan.
