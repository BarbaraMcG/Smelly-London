To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, The Medical Officer of Health has instructed me to submit to you the "Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health" for the year 1915, in order to comply with the requirements of the "Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board. The Birth Rate is 24.38 per 1,000 for Greenwich and 22.6 for the whole of the County of London. The mortality statistics for the year are, unfortunately, not quite of so satisfactory a character as we have been in the habit of recording during recent years, the recorded Death Rate of 17.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population (including 130 deaths of persons, i.e. soldiers and sailors not ordinarily resident in the Borough) being slightly higher than 16.1 per 1,000 of the Death Rate for the County of London and 15.6 per 1,000, the figure for the 96 large towns. If Military deaths were excluded, the recorded Death Rate would be 16.2 per 1,000. The information contained in the National Register has been utilized by the Registrar-General in his calculation of local populations. Estimates of local populations based on the Census returns were clearly inadmissible owing to alterations in populations due to conditions caused by the War. The National Register referred to a date only six weeks removed from that for which estimates were required, viz., the middle of the year 1915. The Registrar-General is of opinion that the estimation of populations in sex and age groups, and the standardizing factors dependent upon them will not be possible, and without these data the correction of recorded Death Rales as regards these particulars cannot be carried out. 12 Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to the recorded Death Rate shows that Greenwich has the highest Death Rate but 10 amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs, the 10 having a higher Death Rate than Greenwich being Chelsea, St. Pancras, Holborn, Finsbury, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Poplar, Southwark, Bermondsey, Deptford. Comparing our relative position with that of last year it will be seen that we still occupy the eighteenth place among the other Metropolitan Boroughs. Full particulars of all the Boroughs in this respect are to be found in the table on page 20. The Infantile Mortality Rate for the Borough, measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered, is 101, an increase from 98, the figure for last year; the figure for all London is 112, compared with 104 in 1914, and the Borough average during the last five years, 1910-14 inclusive, is 104. The Zymotic Death Rate of 1.80 is 0.33 per 1,000 above the corresponding figure for last year. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows:— Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhœa Death fill Rate. Conniption Death Rate.

I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, G. H. DART. 14 VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1915. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the middle of 1915 was 96,385. The distribution of the population throughout the Borough is as follows:— Census, 1911. Estimated Population at middle of year 1915. East Greenwich 45,960 46,406 West Greenwich 22,933 22,960 St. Nicholas 7,290 7,299 Charlton 16,910 16,854 Kidbrooke 2,875 2,866 Total 95,968 96,385 15 MARRIAGES. The Superintendent-Registrar of the Greenwich Registration District has kindly furnished me with the particulars relating to the number of marriages solemnized in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent-Registrar for the Woolwich Registration District has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, with the exception, in these latter particulars, that the marriages performed in the Woolwich Superintendent-Registrar's Office and in Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are not included. The following table shows these particulars, giving the number of marriages in Greenwich and St. Nicholas, etc., for each year since 1893. Year. In Churches of England in in Greenwich.

The total number of Births in the Borough during the year has been 2,347, but of these, 75 occurred in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, the address of the mother being in 27 instances in Deptford, Lewisham 26, Woolwich and Holloway one each. Deducting these and adding 72 which were transferred from Lambeth, City of London, Lewisham and Woolwich, it will be seen that the number of strictly Greenwich births for 1915 is 2,364, of which 1,125 were males and 1,239 females. This corrected figure gives a Birth Rate of 24.56 per 1,000 of the population, being 0.65 below the average for the last fourteen years, 1901 to 1914, the period since the formation of the Metropolitan Borough. Amongst the total number of births registered in the Borough there were 108 in which the name of the father was not registered and therefore not given in the return; accordingly, these births may be presumed to be of an illegitimate character. 36 of such births were registered in the East Greenwich District, which includes the Infirmary of the Greenwich Union. In 20 cases the mother was ordinarily a resident in the Borough of Deptford, one each in Woolwich and Holloway and 21 in Lewisham, and accordingly this number of births have been transferred to those Boroughs. The remaining 65 were similarly allocated to the districts in this Borough in which the mother ordinarily resided, making 36 of such births belonging to East Greenwich, 17 to West Greenwich, 6 to St. Nicholas, and 6 to Charlton. The Birth Rate for the County of London equals 22.6 per 1,000 of the population. It varied from 9.2 in the City of London, 13.4 in the City of Westminster, to 29.99 in Poplar. The Birth Rate for all England and Wales was 21.9. Under the provisions of the Notifications of Births Act, 1907, intimations have been received from medical men, parents, and others, with respect to 2,280 births, from which it will be seen 17 that we have 67 intimations to be credited to births which were registered during the latter part of 1914, or will be registered during the early parts of 1915, as the time allowed by law for registration purposes extends up to six weeks, whereas that under the Notification of Births Act is to be within 36 hours. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during 1915 was 1,690, of which 966 were males and 724 females. The crude Death Rate for the Borough of 17.56 per 1,000 compares with 16.1, the Death Rate for the County of London, and 15.6, the Death Rate for the 96 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude Death Rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 12.4 in Hampstead, 13.4 in Wandsworth, 15.5 in Fulham; whilst the highest rates were 19.4 in Poplar, 21.3 in Bermondsey, 20.7 in Southwark. Locally the Death Rate varied from 17.56 in Charlton, 13.57 in East Greenwich, 19.62 in West Greenwich, 26.52 in St. Nicholas, to 43.41 in Kidbrooke. The following table shows the variation in, and average of, the Death Rates in each of the five Districts of the Borough in the five years, 1910 to 1914, compared with the figures for 1915:— District. 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914. Average for Five Years. East Greenwich 11.19 14.04 11.99 12.46 12.87 12.51 West „ 13.71 16.15 15.03 18.81 18.61 16.46 St. Nicholas 14.46 22.15 22.86 18.78 18.73 19.40 Charlton 9.09 13.61 10.88 12.75 11.83 11.63 Kidbrooke 4.70 6.29 5.63 6.55 27.42 10.12 Borough 11.45 14.86 13.20 14.31 14.95 13.75 Included in the above total number of deaths in the Borough of Greenwich, and all of them with the exception of 1 dying in stretcher in road in East Greenwich, specially allocated to the 18 district of West Greenwich, are a total of 37 deaths of sailors and others occurring in the "Dreadnought" Hospital. Such persons had no known fixed residence in England, and, unfortunately, died in the "Dreadnought" Hospital. The total deaths of soldiers and naval men in the Borough numbered 130, of which 114 occurred in the Royal Herbert Hospital, 1 in the Miller Hospital, 2 in the Brook Hospital, 1 in the Cottage Hospital, 3 in the Seamen's Hospital, 5 in outside institutions, 3 in the public highway, and 1 at the Military Officers' Mess, Shooters Hill Road. The deaths were made up as follows: — English—Expeditionary Forces 36 Others 90 Naval Men 2 128 Belgian 1 German 1 130 The high Death Rate of 43.41 in Kidbrooke includes the deaths of soldiers 117 in number—114 in the Royal Herbert Hospital, 2 in the Brook Hospital, and 1 in the Cottage Hospital. Had these military deaths not have been included in our figures the Death Rate for West Greenwich would have been 16.21 per 1,000, Kidbrooke 5.95 per 1,000, and that of the Borough as a whole 16.20 per 1,000, which figure is still not as favourable as that of previous years. The higher Death Rate is very largely due to the greater number of deaths from diseases of the Respiratory System. There were 301 deaths due to diseases of the respiratory organs, as compared with 115 in the preceding year. Pneumonia alone caused 146 deaths this year. 19 DEATHS IN INSTITUTIONS.

There has been a slight rise in the Infantile Mortality in Charlton and West Greenwich, St. Nicholas and East Greenwich have improved St. Nicholas suffered heavily last year under the abnormal conditions caused by the< alteration of the Foreign Cattle Market, Deiptford, into a barracks. The extra traffic, combined with disturbance of scavenging, and possibly delay in delivery of milk from the conditions which resulted from the outbreak of War, were quite sufficient to account for the increased fatality in this district from Infantile Diarrhoea. With the transfer of this barracks to Blackheath, St. Nicholas has shown an improved Infantile Mortality Rate and an improvement in Diarrhoea Mortality and Notifications also.

Amongst which number, the Hospital Authorities reported that in 8 cases they considered the diagnosis incorrect; 1 of the case.i being thought to be Tonsillitis; 1 Cellulitis; 2 Bronchitis; 1 Laryngitis and 3 not stated. There were 14 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 8.3 per cent. One thousand one hundred and thirty-six specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 1,000 were reported to give negative or doubtful results, and 70 were positive in character, being dealt with accordingly. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1915 has been as follows: — 1st Quarter— East Greenwich, 14 cases; West Greenw ich, 16; St. Nicholas, 1; Charlton, 5; Kidbrooke, 1; a total of 37 cases. 2nd Quarter-—East Greenwich, 10 cases; West Greenwich, 12; St. Nicholas, 3; Charlton, 5; Kidbrooke, 4; a total of 43 cases. 3rd Quarter—East Greenwich, 23 cases; West Greenwich, 0; St. Nicholas, 2; Charlton, 6; a total of 37 cases. 4tk Quarter—East Greenwich, 14 cases; West Greenwich, 23; St. Nicholas, 5; Charlton, 9; Kidbrooke, 1; a total of 52 cases. 34 Membranous Croup.

This Council made an order requiring the notification of cases of Zymotic Enteritis or Summer Diarrhcea during the months of June, July, August and September. The order was duly advertised and came into operation for the months stated. The sections included in the order were Sections 55 and 57 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and under the provisions of these sections 250 cases of Diarrhoea were notified throughout the whole of the Borough, 102 being under one year of age; 125 between one and five; 20 between five and fifteen; 4 between fifteen and twenty-five, 3 between twenty-five and forty-five and 2, sixty-five years and over. One hundred and twenty-eight of such notifications related to patients in East Greenwich, 84 in West Greenwich, 25 in St. Nicholas and 19 in Charlton. Instructions are given by the Female Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitors to the mothers with a view to lessening the mortality among the children already infected and preventing the infection of other members of the family. The importance of cleanliness with regard to the milk and other food supply is pointed out, and a leaflet is left for the general guidance of the parents in dealing with the sick children. Ignorance and improper feeding are the causes of many deaths from this disease. The fact that Diarrhoea is infectious comes as a surprise to many mothers. The number of notifications for Greenwich in 1915 shows a striking decrease in every district, especially in St. Nicholas which shows a decrease of 64. There were 50 deaths ascribed to this disease, comparing with 57 in the previous year. Whooping Cough. Three hundred and three cases were notified (compared with 72 in 1914), 56 being under one year of age, 158 from one to five and 89 from five to fifteen; the districts 39 concerned being East Greenwich, 150; West Greenwich, 95; St. Nicholas 32, and Charlton, 26 (of which total number 4 were treated in Institutions in ihe district). Each of ihese cases was visited and leaflets and instructions left iogeiher with verbal advice respecting the isolation and care of the patient, and at the conclusion of the illness the usual disinfection was carried out. Leprosy. The Local Government Board has not vet agreed to the notification of cases of this disease. Epidemic Cerf.bro-Spinal Meningitis or Cerebo-Spinal Fever. There were 21 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis notified during the year, 5 in East Greenwich, 6 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, 5 in Charlton and 3 in Kidbrooke. Acute Folio-Myelitis or Acute Polio-Encephalitis. This disease was permanently added to the list of notifiable infectious diseases during last year, on an order of the London County Council, approved by the Local Government Board. No case was notified during 1915. There were no cases in 1914 and 1913 and 2 in 1912. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. During the year 12 case of this disease have been notified, 9 being in East Greenwich and 3 in St. Nicholas, and have been dealt with by the nurses at the patients' homes, or in some cases as Out-patients at the Miller Hospital. Contacts. No intimations were received from the Medical Officer of Health of the various Port Sanitary Authorities respecting persons who had been in contact with Small-pox, Plague or Yellow Fever. Glanders. Under the Glanders Order no notification has been made to this authority during the year with respect to outbreaks of Glanders. Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia. No notification of any case of these diseases in man has been received during the year. 40 Tuberculosis. During the year there were 549 cases of Tuberculosis notified in the Borough, 432 being pulmonary cases, ordinarily known as Consumption, and 117 non-pulmonary, being Tuberculosis affecting other portions of the body than the lungs. Of this number of cases, 175 Pulmonary and 57 Non-pulmonary occurred in East Greenwich, 117 Pulmonary and 31 Non-pulmonary in West Greenwich, 60 Pulmonary and 18 Non-pulmonary in St. Nicholas, 52 Pulmonary and 10 Non-pulmonary in Charlton, and 28 Pulmonary and 1 Non-pulmonary in Kidbrooke. The various ages of the patients were as follows:—Pulmonary cases, under one year of age, three cases; from 1 to 5, fourteen cases; 5 to 15, sixtyfour cases; 15 to 25, eighty-eight cases; 25 to 45, one hundred and eighty-six cases; 45 to 65, seventy cases; and 65 and upwards, seven cases: whilst the Non-pulmonary Were—under 1 year of age, seven cases; 1 to 5, seventeen cases; 5 to 15, seventy-three cases; 15 to 25, twelve cases; 25 to 45, five cases; 45 to 65 two cases; and 65 and over, one case. Three hundred and thirty-two specimens were forwarded by medical practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be consumptive; 274 were reported to be negative and 58 positive. Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 88 cases, including 90 rooms and 217 articles of bedding, etc.; disinfectant has also been supplied to patients to disinfect sputum, etc., and sputum pots where such are found necessary. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. Report of Tuberculosis Officer on the Working of the Dispensary for the Year 1915. I have the honour to submit the third report upon the work carried out at the Tuberculosis Dispensary. 41 In the second report the methods of working and the functions of the Dispensary were described at some length; so that it will only be necessary in this report to set out the work donei, and briefly to mention any incidents peculiar to the year. The Dispensary has been affected, as has everything else, by the abnormal times. The principal result has been that everyone not absolutely incapacitated has been able to find work, and overtime work, and insured patients in particular have been affected by this circumstance. The new Dispensary was opened at Maze Hill on 22nd September, 1915, and the work was transferred from Lassell Street with as little disarrangement of the routine as possible. The new premises have been as fully equipped and furnished as the times permit, though much still remains to be done in this respect. New Patients examined during 1915. Recommended by. Males.

Those classed in column 2 have ceascd to attend for various reasons, and a certain number will return; but in the meantime they feel quite well and "complain of nothing." The majority of these are patients who have undoubtedly been exposed to gross infection, and have presented suspicious physical signs, but have not shown sufficiently definite signs to iustify a diagnosis of tuberculosis. It is this class of patient thai, later, without any immediate exposure to infection develops signs sufficient to convince the most sceptical. The tendency of tuberculosis to lie latent has been proved beyond all doubt: these patients, if they should return to the Dispensary complaining of some slight ailment, will be examined to see if any latent focus has "lit up," and the data we have already with regard to them will be very helpful in arriving at a decision. 44 Suspected (observation) Patients disposed of otherwise.

An Interim Tuberculosis Care Committee has been formed for the purpose, principally, of utilizing the resources of those institutions in the Borough which have been for some time past dealing with cases of Tuberculosis. By this means it is hoped bo prevent "overlapping," and to co-ordinate the work of agencies and persons interested from various points of view in the prevention and cure of Tuberculosis. The Interim Committee at present has the following members: — The Medical Officer of Health. The Tuberculosis Officer. The Divisional Medical Officer, L.C.C. Dr. Forbes. District Organiser, L.C.C. Miss Stevens. 45 Charity Organisation Society. Miss Johnston, Hon. Sec. Invalid Children's Aid Association. Miss Dudgeon, Hon. Sec. Invalid Children's Aid Association (St. Nicholas). Miss Dickinson. Board of Guardians. Mrs. Whibley. Miller Hospital. Miss Ferguson, Almoner. The Treatment of Advanced Cases. The weakest point in the present scheme is the lack of adequate institutional accomodation for advanced and failing cases. "There can be no manner of doubt that the far advanced or dying cases constitute the greatest source of infection." G. H. Dart, Tuberculosis Officer. SCHOOL CLINICS, HEALTH CENTRES AND INFANT CONSULTATIONS. These Institutions, as enumerated last year, still continue their good work in the Borough, and, at the time of writing this Report, the Greenwich Borough Council have decided to adopt the course suggested in last year's Annual Report, and to take over the responsibility of administering Conduit House Consultation Centre. In fact this Consultation is now working as a Municipal Institution, and it has been decided to considerably increase the activities of the Centre in the near future. INFANT CONSULTATION, CONDUIT HOUSE. The Consultation at Conduit House, East Greenwich, was started in June, 1913, by the Medical Officer of Health and a number of ladies living in the Borough. The Centre has recently become a Municipal Institution and is administered by the Public Health Committee of the Council, 46 Matters connected with the Clinical working of the Centre have been left in the hands of the former voluntary committee. The Committee has appointed Dr. Helen Pickard, Clinical Assistant at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, to earnon the medical work of the Institution. The doctor advises the mothers on questions of diet, etc., and gives treatment for minor ailments. When necessary, mothers are directed to outside medical aid or hospital treatment. Help is given to the mothers as regards hospital letters,. Surgical Aid Society letters, etc., and debilitated mothers are sent with their babies to Convalescent Homes. Medicines, Virol and other necessaries are supplied. Statistics for the year 1915:— New Cases 436 Attendances 2,332 Medical Consultations 1,432 The Children are weighed at every attendance. HOUSES INSPECTED AND ENQUIRIES MADE IN CONNECTION WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Excluding Measles.

The Public Health Staff have continued to help the Military Authorities in every possible way on the lines laid down by the Local Government Board in various letters and memoranda. The sanitary arrangements of the important Military camps formed in the Borough during the past year have been put into a Satisfactory condition; the work of the Sanitary Inspectors in this direction has undoubtedly been of the first importance in bringing about this desirable state of affairs. DISINFECTION. A total of 4,126 articles were disinfected for the military during this period. A detailed statement will be found on page 47. SANITARY WORK. The Tables on pages 88 to 92 summarise, as far as possible, the Sanitary work of the Department; from this it will be seen that a total of 11,614 houses and premises have been inspected or reinspected during the year; 1,052 intimation notices have been served, and 137 statutory notices With the exception of prosecutions in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, it was not found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings in any case during the year. There were altogether throughout the year 290 complaints entered in the Public Complaints Register of the Department; these were in each case carefully investigated, and any necessary action immediately taken; thus there are none of these matters left outstanding or unattended to. 50 Bakehouses. One hundred and forty-nine inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 49 nuisances found therein have been abated as the result. Factories and Workshops. One hundred and seventy-three inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 219 workshop premises on the Register at the beginning of the year, 3 have been added during the year, and 10 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 212. This total includes 18 laundries, 35 dressmaking and mantle works, 7 fuel and firewood works, 3 cycle works, 8 milliners, and various others, including workplaces, such as 5 blacksmiths, 14 barge builders, 3 builders' yards, etc. Information has been sent to H.M.
