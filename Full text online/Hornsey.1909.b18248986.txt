To His Worship the Mayor, the Aldermen, and the Members of the Council of the Borough of Hornsey. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the health of the Borough during the year 1909. The position as shewn by the chief Vital Statistics is a very satisfactory one. The death-rate remains very low indeed. The Infantile death-rate is considerably lower than that of 1908, which was itself the lowest on record. Infectious disease was a little more prevalent than in 1908, but the number of cases notified to me was much below the average of the last 20 years, notwithstanding the great growth in the population of the district. Of the non-notifiable infectious diseases, Measles was prevalent in the district for the greater part of the year, but the disease was of a very mild type, no more deaths being registered from this cause than in 1908, when the disease was much less prevalent. This year a limited scheme of compulsory notification of Phthisis is in operation. The Medical Officers and other Officials of the Poor Law Union must notify cases of Phthisis occurring in Poor Law patients under their control. This year, therefore, Phthisis takes its place on the table on page 36 of notification of Infectious Disease. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HAROLD COATES, M.D., D.P.H. 3 BOROUGH OF HORNSEY.

Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part 3, adopted July, 1896. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, adopted. Population. Year by year I have drawn attention to the growing divergence of the estimates formed of the population of the district, according as the calculation is based on the number of occupied houses as shown in the rate books, or is reckoned by the Registrar General's method. On the former basis, for 1909, the estimated population is 92,389. For the same year the Registrar General's estimate is 95,628, a difference of 3,239. The true population probably lies somewhere between these two estimates. The Registrar General's figures are too high, because the rate of building has slackened down very much of recent years. On the other hand the estimate based on the number cf occupied houses and the number of occupants per house is too low, as in some parts of the Borough the tendency is for the average 4 number of occupants per house to increase, owing to the growing practice of sub-letting parts of a house, and the letting of furnished rooms. For the purpose of statistics one method of calculation or tbe other must be adopted, and the estimated population of 92,389 is the one more nearly correct. The population calculated on this basis in 1908 was 90,814, so that the estimated increase in numbers for the twelve months is 1,575. This is a much larger increase than in the previous year, when it was only 593, but is much less than some of the annual increases of population of recent years. The following table shews the yearly increase per cent, for each year since the last census:— Increase of population during the year. Increase per cent. 1901-1902 2,076 2.8 1902-1903 2,829 3.7 1903-1904 5.775 7.3 1904-1905 986 1.5 1905-1906 1,664 1.9 1906-1907 3,344 3.7 1907-1908 593 0.6 1908-1909 1,575 1.7 The table also indicates the spasmodic nature of our growth, and is fairly characteristic of new suburban areas. The year's increase of population on the estimates for 1908 and 1909 of the Registrar General is 2,915. In this report all statistics are based on the estimated population at the middle of the year of 92,389. The estimated population at the end of each Quarter of 1909 was as follows:— End of first quarter 91,503 ,, second ,, 91,693 ,, third ,, 91,978 fourth ,, 93,759 The population of the Borough at the last census (1901) was 72,056. The increase of Population during 8¼ years, from the date of the census to the middle of 1909, was, therefore, 20,333. 5 This is equal to an average yearly increase of 2,464, so that the increase (1,575) for the twelve months 1908-1909 is considerably below the average yearly increase of the last 8 years. The "natural increase" of population during 1909, i.e., excess of births over deaths, was 721. As the actual increase was 1,575, a little less than one half the actual increase of population is attributable to "natural growth" of the 1908 population and a little more than half is due to immigration, so that the Borough has gained 734 new residents from outside during the year. The following table shews the estimated population for each Ward in 1908 and 1909, with the increase or decrease which has taken place in the interval:— Ward. Estimated population, 1908. Estimated population, 1909. Variation during the year, 30th June, 1908, to 30th June, 1909. Increase. Decrease. Highgate 13.100 13,331 231 - Muswell Hill 12,565 13,167 602 — Crouch End 5,782 5,951 169 — West Hornsey 14,054 14,343 289 — East Hornsey 12,842 13,033 191 — North Haringey 10,090 10,086 — 4 South Haringey 5,753 5,969 216 — Stroud Green 9,575 9,354 — 221 Finsbury Park 7,053 7,155 102 — The Borough 90,814 92,389 1,800 225 The chief increase has been in Muswell Hill, 602 out of a net increase for the whole Borough of 1,575. Highgate and West Hornsey have grown at about the same rate as during the previous year. South Haringey and East Hornsey have considerable increases to set against losses in the previous twelve months. In Crouch End the increase is considerably larger than in the preceding year, and Finsbury Park maintains an even rate of growth. 6 In the two remaining Wards there are losses in numbers on the estimated population. In North Haringey there is a small loss of 4, as against a considerable loss of 195 in 1908, but in Stroud Green the loss is 221 this year, as compared with a loss of 78 in 1908. For the whole Borough, therefore, there is a total gain of 1,800, and a loss of 225, or a net gain of 1,575. The following table shews the Ward populations at the census, the estimated population 1909, and the increase in 8¼ years:— Ward. Population, Census 1901. Estimated Population. June 30th, 1909.

Highgate 10,176 13,331 3,155 — Muswell Hill 5,833 13,167 7,334 — Crouch End 4,761 5,951 1,190 — West Hornsey 14,343 18,662 8,714 — East Hornsey 13,033 North Haringey 10,129 10,086 — 43 South Haringey 5,917 5,969 52 — Stroud Green 9,356 9,354 — 2 Finsbury Park 7,222 7,155 - 67 72,056 92,389 20,445 112 This table shews the remarkable growth of Muswell Hill. In a little over 8 years the population of this part of the Borough has grown from 5,833 to 13,167. Very considerable increases have also occurred at Highgate and Hornsey. At the date of the census, the division into East and West Hornsey had not been made, and the gain is, therefore, shewn on the combined population of the two wards. A gain of nearly 1,200 in Crouch End on a small initial population is also satisfactory. In the other parts of the Borough the population is almost unchanged as regards numbers. Density of Population.—With the growth of the population of the Borough, the number of persons per acre has increased 7 from 25 at the time of the 1901 census to 32.1 at the middle of 1909. At the middle of 1908 the density was 31.5 persons per acre. North Haringey remains much the most thickly-populated ward, with 80 persons per acre, though East and West Hornsey are gradually creeping up near this figure. Crouch End, with 15 persons per acre, is at the other extreme. Muswell Hill, in spite of its rapid growth, has still only 19 persons per acre, and Highgate 18. The following table shews the density of population for each Ward:— Ward. Area in acres. Population. ' Number of persons per acre. Highgate 709.5 13,331 18 Muswell Hill 663.5 13,167 19 Crouch End 376 5,951 15 West Hornsey 227.5 14,343 63 East Horusey 195.5 13,033 66 North Haringey 125 10,086 80 South Haringey 109 5,969 54 Stroud Green 269 9,354 34 Finsbury Park 199 7,155 35 2,874 92,389 32.1 Births .—The number of births recorded during 1909 was 1,508. This is an increase of 23 over the number of births registered in 1908. In the preceding twelve months (1908, compared with 1907) there was a decrease of 39 in the recorded births. Twenty-seven of the births were illegitimate (25 in 1908). Ten of the births occurred at the Edmonton Workhouse, but no other births belonging to the Borough are recorded as occurring in Public Institutions. The birth-rate for the year was 16.3, exactly the same as in 1908. The accompanying chart shews that in 1884 the birth-rate was over 33 per 1,000 of the population. Now it is less than half that figure, and the decline from 1884 to the present time has 8 been almost continuous. The last occasion on which there was a slight rise in the birth.rate was 1899. The number of births and the birth.rate for each quarter of the year is as follows:— 1609. HOENSEY. ENGLAND AND WALES. No. of Birtbs. Birth.rate. Birth.rate. 1st Quarter 368 15.8 25.9 2nd ,, 422 18.2 26.6 3rd , 371 160 25.4 4th 349 15.1 24.3 1,508 16.3 25.6 In the second and fourth quarters of the year the birth.rate was slightly higher than in the corresponding quarters of 1908, and slightly lower in the first and third quarters. The birth.rates in certain towns are given below:— London and adjoining districts ' Tottenham 29.4 West Ham Willesden 27.2 25.2 Croydon London 24.4 24.2 East Ham 23.6 Finchley 20.3 Hornsey 16.3 Swansea 33.033.0 Huddersfield 24.5 St. Helen's 32.1 Wolverhampton 23.8 Middlesbrough 31.9 York 23.8 Wigan 31.5 Aston Manor 23.7 Walsall 28.0 Rochdale 22.7 Stockport 26.4 Reading 20.9 Devonport 26.1 Northampton 20.1 Burnley 25.1 The following table gives the number of births during the year, and the birth.rate for each Ward of the Borough:— 9 WARD.

The proportion of illegitimate births of the total registered births is a very low one, viz.:—1.7 per cent. Eight of the illegitimate births occurred in the Edmontou Workhouse, and in the following table these have been allocated to the wards of the Borough in which the mothers resided before gaining admission to the Workhouse.

The death-rate calculated on these figures (gross death-rate) is 7.53 per thousand of the mean population for the year. The table on page 17 shews that the death-rate for the last 6 or 7 years has been somewhere about this figure, which, of course, is an extremely low one. This, however, includes only deaths actually registered in the Borough, and does not include those of Hornsey people dying elsewhere. There were 127 Hornsey people who died outside the district during 1909, viz.:— 34 in the Edmonton Workhouse, 18 in the Great Northern Central Hospital, 51 in other Hospitals outside the Borough, 16 in Lunatic Asylums, and 8 in various other places. On the other hand there were 36 deaths registered in Hornsey of persons non-resident in the district. To get the net deaths belonging to Hornsey we must add to the number of deaths registered in the Borough the number (127) of Hornsey people dying outside the Borough, and deduct the number (36) of deaths registered in Hornsey of persons who normally resided in other districts. This gives us the net number of deaths belonging to Hornsey as 787, an increase of 35 over the corresponding number for 1908. The death-rate calculated on these figures is the net deathrate, and for the past 5 years is as follows:— Year. Net death-rate. 1905 8.16 1906 8.85 1907 8.49 1908 8.28 1909 8.51 For these five years, for which alone can the comparison be made, as the figures for years preceding 1905 are not obtainable, it is seen that the net death-rate, which is the true death-rate of the district, has been remarkably constant and also very low. The following table gives the net death-rates for England and Wales, and the 76 Great Towns:— 13 England and Wales 14.5 76 Great Towns 14.7 Hornsey 8.5 Plymouth 14.5 Walthamstow 9.6 Walsall 14.5 Handsworth 9.8 Newcastle-on-Tyne 14.8 King's Norton 9.8 Hull 14.9 East Ham 9.9 Bolton 15.1 Leyton 10.3 Sheffield 15.1 Willesden 10.4 South Shields 15.1 York 11.4 Brighton 15.3 Reading 11.5 Newport (Mon.) 15.3 Tottenham 11.5 West Bromwich 15.3 Devonport 11.6 Birmingham 15.4 Croydon 11.7 Preston 15.8 West Hartlepool 11.8 Birkenhead 15.9 Burton-on-Trent 12.0 Coventry 16.0 Barrow-in-Furness 12.2 Wolverhampton 16.0 Hastings 12.5 Burnley 16.1 Bristol 12.7 Bury 16.2 Gateshead 12.7 Rochdale 16.2 Bournemouth 12.8 Blackburn 16.3 Smethwiek 12.8 Nottingham 16.3 Wallasey 12.8 Huddersfield 16.3 Leicester 12.9 Rhondda 16.3 Aston Manor 13.0 Stockport 16.5 Cardiff 13.1 Bootle 16.9 Ipswich 13.2 Sunderland 16.9 Rotherham 13.2 Warrington 17.1 Grimsby 13.3 Tynemouth 17.3 Northampton 13.3 Great Yarmouth 17.5 Derby 13.4 Merthyr Tydfil 17.7 Southampton 13.4 Manchester 17.9 Halifax 13.9 Salford 18.0 Norwich 13.9 Hanley 18.1 Stockton-on-Tees 13.9 St. Helens 18.6 London 14.0 Liverpool 19.0 West Ham 14.0 Middlesbrough 19.1 Leeds 14.1 Oldham 19.1 Portsmouth 14.2 Wigan 19.1 Bradford 14.5 Swansea 19.4 14 1908. 1909.

Of those diseases which have caused an increased mortality, the chief are diseases of the respiratory organs, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Emphysema and Asthma having caused 37 more deaths than in 1908. No doubt the cold wet weather of the past twelve months has been responsible for much of the increased mortality from these causes. From Phthisis and other forms of tuberculosis 14 more deaths are attributed than in the previous year. The chief diseases from which there is a decreased death roll included Influenza, with 11 fewer victims, and Cancer, with 9 fewer deaths, compared with 1908. There is a large drop in the number of deaths registered as due to Alcoholism, less than half the number being recorded in 1909 as compared with 1908 (9 and 19 respectively). The following table shews the diseases which caused fewer deaths in 1909 as compared with 1908, and the gain in each case: 1909. 1908. Decrease Cancer 75 84 9 Old Age 66 69 3 Premature Birth 17 20 3 Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of Liver 9 19 10 Epidemic Influenza 15 26 11 Want of Breast Milk, Marasmus and Convulsions 12 17 5 19  1909. 1908.

Increase Bronchitis and Pneumonia 114 89 25 Heart Disease 94 83 11 Phthisis 57 53 4 Apoplexy 44 39 5 Bright's Disease 30 22 8 Forms of Tuberculosis other than Phthisis 26 16 10 Accidents 24 14 10 Diabetes Mellitus 17 10 7 Emphysema, Asthma 14 2 12 Whooping Cough 12 11 1 Appendicitis 12 4 8 Diphtheria 10 9 1 Debility at Birth and Congenital Defects 10 9 1 Tuberculosis. -The deaths from Phthisis of the Lung numbered 57, or 4 more than in the previous year and 5 more than the yearly average for the preceding 5 years. Three of these 57 deaths occurred in persons who had been removed to the Edmonton Workhouse. During the last four years the number of deaths from Phthisis has increased rather more than in proportion to the growth of the population, so that the death-rate from consumption per 1,000 persons living has slowly risen. From forms of Tuberculosis other than Phthisis there were 26 deaths registered, an increase of 10, compared with the year 1908. The total deaths from all forms of Tuberculosis were, therefore, 83, or 14 more than in the previous year. 20 By as Order of the Local Govern merit Board, the Medical Officers and certain other officials in the service of the Poor Law Guardians are directed to notify to the Medical Officer of Health cases of Phthisis occurring among their Poor Law patients. During the year I have had 16 such cases notified to me. In each case a visit or visits have been paid to the house of the patient. In those cases where the patient had not been admitted into the Workhouse, verbal and printed directions were given as to the avoidance of the spread of infection, and where necessary disinfection of looms or articles of bedding, clothing, etc., has been carried out. Similar preventive measures are carried out in other cases of Phthisis brought to my knowledge, when they appear necessary or desirable. The following table shews the ages at death from Phthisis an * from other forms of Tuberculosis:— Ages at death from Phthisis and from other forms of tub:/culosis:— Years inclusive : 0-4 5-14 15-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65 & over Number of deaths from Phthisis 1 1 7 12 14 10 6 6 Other forms of tuberculosis 16 1 2 4 2 0 1 0 All forms of tuberculosis 17 2 9 16 16 10 7 6 This shews again that the principal incidence of Phthisis is in the middle years of life, and that other forms of Tuberculosis are chiefly fatal in infancy. At the middle years of life, viz.:—15-44 years of age, out of a total of 144 deaths registered in the Borough, 33, or nearly onefourth, were due to Phthisis alone. The following table is interesting as giving the number of deaths from Phthisis and other forms of Tuberculosis and the number of deaths from the seven principal infectious diseases fnr the past 8 years : —  1909. 1908. 1907. 1908. 1905. 1904. 1903. 1902.

There were 75 yeaths registered as due to Cancer in 1909, a decrease of 9, comparing 1909 with 1908. Reference to the accompanying chart will shew that there has been a considerable and fairly regular rise in the death-rate from Cancer in recent years, and that on previous occasions a drop in the death-rate has only been of a temporary character. The death-rate from Cancer rose from 0.38 per thousand persons living in 1895 to 0.92 in 1908, and now stands at 0.81. 25 Annual death-rates from Cancer per thousand persons living for 15 years 1895-1909. 26 The following table shews the Wards in which deaths from Cancer have occurred during the last 10 years: — Year.

Only one death was registered from this cause. Reference to the table on page 26 will shew that in epidemic years as 1906, 1904, 1899, the number of deaths from this cause has been 30, 24 and 32 respectively. tion is taken into account, as the following table shews, the past year is the most favourable so far, in the experience of the Borough, as far as these causes of death are conoerned. 28 Reference to column 5 of the accompanying table will shew that the type of case was on the whole of a mild character, and column 9 of the same table shews that the influence of Diphtheria on the death.rate is not above the average of recent years.

Enteric Fever, which caused 2 deaths in 1908, did not, in any of the few cases occurring in the Borough in 1909, cause a single death. Scarlet Fever caused 3 deaths in 1909, the same number as in 1908. Hot dry summers are favourable to the prevalence of this disease, and its almost complete absence in 1909 is largely due to the cold and wet weather which prevailed in the summer months. The death.rate from Diarrhoea per 1,000 of the population was 0.01 in 1909, 0.09 in 1908, 0.03 in 1907 and 0.47 in 1906. Diphtheria.—Although there were considerably more cases of Diphtheria notified than in the previous year, the number of deaths from this cause in 1909 (viz.:—10) only exceeded by one those due to the same cause in 1908 (viz.:—9). 29 From Measles also the number of deaths, 12, was the same in 1909 as in 1908, although the disease was much more prevalent in 1909. Whooping Cough saused one more death in 1909 than in 1908, 12 as against 11. The death.rate from this cause was 0.12 per 1,000 of the population. From Puerperal Fever 2 deaths occurred, as compared with 3 in 1908 and 2 in 1907. Ages at Death.—The ages at which deaths occurred are as follows : — 1909 1908 1907 1906 1905 1904 Under 1 year 87 95 116 136 106 145 1 year and under 5 years 55 52 50 55 43 66 5 years and under 15 21 19 23 32 16 24 15 „ 25 „ 27 33 16 34 24 28 25 „ 65 „ 309 295 291 269 272 203 65 years and over 288 258 270 243 235 224 Total deaths 787 752 766 769 696 690 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

The infantile mortality for the year 1909, i.e., deaths under 1 year of age per 1,000 births, is 57, the lowest yet recorded in Hornsey. In 1908 the infantile mortality rate was 63, and the average rate of the 15 years 1894-1908 was 91, the highest being 133 in 1895 and the lowest 63 in 1908.

Full particulars of infantile deaths, as to causes and ages, are tabulated at the end of this report. Deaths under one year of age of Illegitimate Children.— There were 27 illegitimate births registered during the year, and 8 deaths under 1 year of age of illegitimate children occurred. This gives an infantile mortality among illegitimate children of 296. The number of legitimate births registered was 1,481, and the number of deaths under 1 year of age of legitimate children was 79. This gives an infantile mortality among legitimate children of 53 35 The following table gives the principal Ward statistics: — WARD. EStimated population. Birth.rate. Death.rate.

The increase is almost entirely due to a greater prevalence of Diphtheria this year, the increase of cases over 1908 being 58. There are also 16 cases of Phthisis included for the first time, owing to the notification of Poor Law cases. In the case of every other disease there is a decrease of notifications as compared with 1908. Scarlet Fever shews a decrease of 18 in the notifications received, although 1908 was itself a year when the disease was prevalent to an extent much below the average. In the case of Enteric Fever, only 4 notifications were received during the year. This disease shews an almost regular decline in the number of cases notified, from 48 in the year 1895 down to 11 in 1907, 9 in 1908 and 4 this year. Erysipelas keeps fairly constant, and 37 cases notified this year is not far from the average. The cases notified during each quarter of the year were as follows:— 36 1909. Scarlet Fever.

Diphtheria was chiefly prevalent during the last quarter of the year. The cases were for the most part of a mild type, and 37 the mortality from the disease was, in fact, less than in many years when the disease was less prevalent. The extreme mildness of many of the cases was, indeed, the chief factor in the spread of the disease. Cases frequently occurred where, owing to the slight illness in the primary case, several other persons had been infected before the nature of the disease was recognized, and consequently no steps towards prevention had been taken.

As compared with the previous year there were 179 more patients admitted in 1909, viz.:—673 in 1909 and 494 in 1908 The following table gives particulars of the admissions of patients in recent years. From the following tables it will be seen that Hornsey and Wood Green made use of the Hospital in almost equal degree, 272 cases being admitted from Hornsey and 270 from Wood Green. While there was a slight increase in the admission of Hornsey patients, as compared with 1908, the number of Wood Green patients admitted in 1909 was nearly double the number admittel from the same district in 1908. From Finchley 130 cases were admitted in 1909, almost the same number as in the previous year. 1909 1908. 1907. 1906. 1905.

Scarlet Fever.—The number of cases notified in Hornsey during 1909 was 221, and of these 173, equal to 78 per cent. of the cases notified, were admitted to the Isolation Hospital. There were also 67 cases of Scarlet Fever admitted from Finchley and 229 from Wood Green. There were seven deaths in the Hospital during the year from Scarlet Fever, giving a case mortality of 1.3 per cent. of the cases of Scarlet Fever under treatment. Diphtheria.—There were 151 cases of Diphtheria notified in the Borough during the year, and of these 99 cases (equal to 65 per cent. of those notified) were admitted to the Isolation Hospital. There were also 60 cases of Diphtheria admitted from Finchley and 41 from Wood Green. There were 17 deaths in the Hospital during the year from Diphtheria, giving a case mortality of 7.7 per cent. of the cases of Diphtheria under treatment. Enteric Fever.—There were four cases of this disease notified in the Borough during the year, none of which were admitted to the Borough Hospital. There were 3 cases of Enteric Fever admitted from Finchley, all of whom recovered. Municipal Laboratory.—During the year 1,791 specimens were examined from patients who were, or were suspected to be., suffering from Diphtheria. Of these 1,493 were specimens taken at the Hospital, and 298 specimens were sent in by Medical men practising in the district. 45 There were 43 specimens sent by Medical practitioners for examination from suspected cases of Tuberculosis, and 17 miscel laneous specimens were received and examined. There were also 31 specimens examined from children suffering from Ringworm who were scholars at the public elementary schools. Altogether 1,882 specimens were examined in the Bacteriological Laboratory, of which 358 were received from Medical men praptising in the district. Last year there were 173 specimens received from Medical practitioners. There were 1,624 samples of sewage and effluent analysed and reported on. There were also 34 samples of drinking water examined, and in every case the sample was found to be quite satisfactory. Eleven miscellaneous samples were also examined. Diseases of Animals Acts.—There were two outbreaks of Glanders during the year, and 2 horses were destroyed. The Council paid £10 to the owners as compensation, in accordance with the Glanders Order, for the loss of these horses. There were 4 certificates for the movement of swine issued. The following table shews the number of dogs seized and dealt with, for the nine months ending 30th September, under the Dogs Act, 1906:— DOGS. Seized by Police. Claimed _ by, Owners. Sold. Destroyed. 1st Quarter 136 6 9 121 2nd ,, 126 12 5 109 3rd „ 107 8 10 89 Totals for the 9 months 369 26 24 319 The Agreement between the Council and the Commissioner of Police, for the keep and destruction of stray dogs, expired on the 30th September. 46 Employment of Children Act, 1903.—The Report of the Chief Inspector for the year ended December 31st, 1909, is as follows:— "It would appear from the Officers' reports that the number of children employed under the provisions of the above Act differ very little from year to year. Of the 93 cases of illegal employment recorded, 59 children were engaged during prohibited hours, 15 in occupations not allowed by the Bye-laws, while 19 were under the prescribed age. In all cases the notice served on the employer had the desired effect, and legal proceedings were not necessary. The working arrangement with the London Authority has proved very useful in stopping the influx of children from the Metropolitan area." Inspection of Meat and other Foods.—All the Inspectors have obtained the special certificate granted by the Royal Sanitary Institute for this work, and the whole of the slaughter-houses and butchers' shops are kept under observation by them. There are nine slaughter-houses and seventy-six butchers' shops in the Borough. Four of the slaughter-houses are only used occasionally and for slaughtering sheep. Frequent inspections are made of the slaughter-houses during the time of slaughtering and also at other times. Special attention is paid to butchers' shops at the latter part of the week, when the stock is usually largest. At the time of inspection no tuberculous carcases were found, but a pluck from a bullock was found to be affected; this was immediately surrendered and destroyed by the Corporation at their destructor. Diseased and Unsound Food.—The following articles have been destroyed at the instance of the Local Authority during the year: 47 lbs. Offal (Liver, Lungs, etc.) 11 lbs. Pears. 15 lbs. Strawberries. 2 doz. Oranges. 24 lbs. Greengages. 47 Factory and Workshop Act, 11)01.—Register of Workshops.—The number of Workshops 011 the Register at the end of 1908 was 332. During the year 1909 46 workshops have been added and 6 taken off the Register, so that at the end of 1909 there were 368 workshops 011 the Register in Hornsey. They were as follows:— Dressmakers 73 Milliners 30 Bootmakers and repairers 46 Cycle makers and repairers 6 Farriers 3 Picture Frame makers 3 Children's Outfitters 1 Tailors 25 Laundries 25 Restaurant Kitchens 35 Bakers 42 Miscellaneous 79 711 inspections were made and 61 written notices were served. The number of sanitary defects discovered and remedied was 92. As in previous years, want of cleanliness is the most frequent defect to be dealt with. In 40 cases, comparing with 30 for the previous year, the occupier was requested to cleanse, and this was immediately done. During the year 2 cases of overcrowding were found, and in each case the nuisance was at once abated. In 32 cases the sanitary accommodation was found to be unsuitable, insufficient or defective. At 1 workshop separate accommodation was not provided for each sex. These nuisances were, however, remedied on the occupier's attention being called to the matter. Home Work.—There are 77 persons on the list of homeworkers, an increase of 14 during the year. In every case the premises occupied have been inspected, but no insanitary condition existed. No case of infectious disease has occurred in a house occupied by a home-worker. Uakchouscs.—There are 42 bakehouses in the Borough, being one more than in 1908. 48 There are 5 underground bakehouses in the Borough. Frequent inspections have been made of bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, places where ice cream is made, and other business premises concerned in the preparation of food, and, speaking generally, the conditions found were satisfactory. Dairies and Milkshops, numbering 74, and 3 Cowsheds in the Borough, have been frequently inspected. In 12 instances contravention of the bye-laws or regulations have been found, and the matters were at once attended to. The number of premises now on the list for periodical inspection is 907, as compared with 715 for last year, 705 for 1907, 525 for 1906, 495 for 1905, 412 in 1904, and 152 in 1903. Preliminary notices issued numbered 713, and statutory notices 166.
