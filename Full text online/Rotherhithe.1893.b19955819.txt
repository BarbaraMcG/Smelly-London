The consent of the London County Council having been obtained to borrow the sum of £5000 for the purpose, and the Council having notified their willingness to advance the same for a period of 55 years to be repaid by equal annual instalments on 28th February in each year, and to bear interest at the rate of£3 10s. per cent, per annum, payable quarterly on 28th February, 28th May, 28th August and 28th November, it was Resolved to take up the loan upon these terms. The purchase of the property had not been completed at the close of the year Erection of Town Hall, Vestry Hall, Offices, &c. As mentioned in the previous report the Vestry had resolved to purchase the old Drill Hall site in the Lower Road for the erection thereon of a Town Hall, Vestry Hall, Offices, etc., subject to the sanction of the London County Council being obtained to borrow the money, Application having since been made to the London County Council for their sanction to borrow the money (£1100) for the purchase thereof, the Council notified their willingness to lend the amount to be repaid by 50 equal annual instalments of £22 with interest at the rate of £3 10s. per cent, per annum, payable quarterly. This loan was taken up by the Vestry on 9th June, 1893. Negotiations having been entered into for the purchase of the freehold and leasehold interests in 85 and 87, Neptune Street (which join the old Drill Hall site) as an additional site for the erection of the buildings, and £1250 being the very lowest sum for which the purchase could be effected, and it being absolutely necessary that the additional site should be acquired for the purposes of the Vestry's scheme for the erection thereon of a Town Hall, etc., the Vestry agreed to the said terms subject to the sanction of the London County Council being obtained to borrow the money The matter was still incomplete at the close of the year. 43 Roadway, Southwark Park. On the 9th June, 1893, a deputation from this Vestry, together with one from the Vestry of Bermondsey, attended before the Parks Committee of the London County Council to present a petition praying that the main thoroughfare through Southwark Park might be daily kept open until midnight in order to obviate the necessity of persons whose employment lies in Bermondsey but who reside in Rotherhithe or Deptford, having to go a long distance round every day to get to and from their work. The case was strongly put to the Committee who promised to give the matter their full consideration. Surrey Commercial Dock Scheme. A Bill was introduced into Parliament, Session 1894, by the Surrey Commercial Dock Company to authorise them to alter and extend their works, to raise further capital, and for other purposes. On 27th November, 1893, a letter was received from Messrs. Druces & Attlee, the Solicitors for the Dock Company, forwarding plan, sections, book of reference and copy advertisement of their proposed undertaking in the Parish for which they intended to apply for Parliamentary powers, for deposit in the Vestry office. On 4th December, 1893, a letter was received from the Engineer of the London County Council requesting to be informed whether the Vestry objected to the proposed scheme of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, or any part thereof, and if so, enquiring the nature of such objections, and what provisions the Vestry deemed necessary for the protection of the public interests entrusted to their charge; These letters were referred to a Special Committee of the whole Vestry for consideration and report. The Committee having met, reported as under:— That the Clerk had submitted to them a report by the Surveyor of Sewers upon the several works proposed to be executed by the Dock Company, also the notices dated 9th December, 1893. 44 received from the Company's Solicitors with cards to be returned, stating whether the Vestry "assented to" or "dissented from," or "remained neutral" in respect to the proposed undertaking, and that after discussion and inspection of the deposited plans, they had decided to visit the portions of the Parish affected by the proposed undertaking, and the meeting was accordingly adjourned until Friday, 15th December, at 2 p.m., for that purpose, and the Clerk was instructed to write and ask Mr. McConnochic, the Engineer to the Dock Company, to meet the Committee. The Meeting was held, and the Committee reported having met Mr. McConnochie, who accompanied them along the route of the proposed undertaking, and fully explained the same in detail, and also the proposed gradients of the new roads to be formed, and after consideration of the matter, Eecommended—That with the view of giving the Vestry a locus standi to obtain such improvements or concessions as they may deem advisable, the Vestry formally "dissent from" the proposed undertaking. This was agreed to by the Vestry, who also ordered a return to be made of the number of people who would be displaced by the scheme, and of the ratable value of all the hereditaments included in the proposed undertaking. It was also Besolved upon the recommendation of the Committee that the whole question of the stopping up and diversion of the Parish roads be referred to the Surveyor of Sewers, and that he be requested to report as to the difference in the area between the present Parish roads to be taken and the new roads to be given in substitution therefor, and also as to the gradients of the proposed new roads, and advise as to making a better approach to the new road to be formed out of the Lower Road at Osprey Street, than that shown upon the deposited plan. The Surveyor of Sewers having reported to the Committee as under:— 61, King William Street, London Bridge, E.C. 14th February, 1894. REPORT ON SUBBEY COMMEBCIAL DOCK EXTENSION BILL, 1894. Dear Sirs, The area of roads to be stopped is the total of 107,300 ft. supl. The total area of new roads to be formed is 115,200 supl. 45 The gradients of the new roads are all less than those of the old, and therefore easier for traffic. I have seen Mr. McConnochie, the engineer of the Dock Company, and have pointed out to him the wish of the Vestry, that the entrance to the new road from the Lower Road should be made 60 ft. wide, and the Board of Directors have approved that should be so, and extending northward for a distance of 100 ft. into the width of the new road shewn on the plans deposited and the Company concede that should be so for a distance of 80 ft., this I think the Vestry should be satisfied with as the width with Osprey Street, would thus be 100 ft. at the entrance. The Bill provides that all the substituted sewers should be of the same sectional area as the old ; this I consider should be satisfactory, although a very small portion is under the jurisdiction of the Vestry, the other portions belonging to the County Council; and all the works are to be executed subject to the approval of the Council and the Vestry respectively. The 12th Section of the Bill provides that the "Swing Bridge Road" may be stopped between "the junction of the Swing Bridge with the Plough Road" and so much of the Plough Road, as is between its junction with the Swing Bridge Road, and its junction with Yeoman Street. That Jewett Street may be stopped; as also William Street from east end of Osprey Street to a point 19 yards northward of the east end of Trident Street; Maynard Road for a distance of 70 yards at its end; Charlotte Place so far as it runs parallel with Purnell Place and for a distance of 115 yards from its south eastern end; So much of the footpath crossing Greenland Dock as will be rendered unnecessary; and So much of London Street as is between the junction therewith of Grove Street and Plough Road, but only a small portion is in Rotherhithe. The Company shall not stop up the Street and portions until they are owners of and in possession of the said houses and land on both sides of the etreet and portion of streets, roads, and places to be stopped up. 13th Section. If any differences arise they are to bo settled by the decision of two Justices. 46 14th Section. The Company may maintain a tramway across the road No. 2. The Company are to give 21 days' notice before making sewers with plans, and 21 days is allowed for the approval of the Council and Vestry. Ten years are allowed for the completion of the Works. New dwellings to be provided before old are displaced. Conditions of Secretary of State may be enforced by mandamus. If the Company acquire any house or houses in contravention of the Act, they are liable to a penalty of £500 recoverable by the Secretary of State. The Court may reduce the penalty. The Secretary of State may direct any inquiries by the Local Government Board under the Public Health Act, 1875, and appoint inspectors, the Company to pay all expenses. All buildings are to be subject to the Metropolitan Buildings and Metropolis Management Act, 1855. The Secretary of State may dispense with the provisions as to dwellings when houses empty or subject. Land for dwellings to be appropriated for 25 years. 29th Section. Power to raise £350,000 additional capital. This I think is all that the Bill generally provides for, but as I only had the Bill in the middle of yesterday there may be matters that have escaped my attention, owing to limited time allowed. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, GEO. LEGG. To the Vestry of Rotherhithe. It was resolved upon the recommendation of the Committee—That the Committee confer with the Directors of the Company, with the view of the extension of section 21 of the Bill, so as to include all houses taken, and accommodation being provided for all persons displaced. That the Clerk be instructed to take all necessary steps to protect the interests of the Vestry, and in recovering an equivalent from the Company for loss of rates during the progress and construction of the works, and that he be authorised to instruct Messrs. Roberts and Chubb, Parlimentary Agents, to watch the progress of the Bill through its various stages through the House of Commons (if necessary). 47 That the Company be requested to pitch the new roads in the same way as the old ones, and maintain them in good repair for three years from the date of the opening of such roads, etc., to traffic. That with reference to the culs de sac at the bottom of William Street, Maynard Road, and Osprey Street, the Company be requested to provide a better means of ingress and egress. That the Directors of the Dock Company be requested to agree to the widening of the bridges to 30 ft., instead of 25 ft., so as to embrace a double line for vehicular traffic, as suggested by the engineer to the London County Council, in his report to the Council on the provisions of the Bill. That the Directors of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company be asked to receive a deputation from the Vestry on Tuesday, 29th February, at 2 p.m., that the deputation consist of five members of the Vestry, and that the following gentlemen be deputed to form such deputation, Rev. Canon Beck, Messrs. Talbot, Bisley and Stuart, and that Mr. Legg, the Surveyor of Sewers, be invited to attend with the Clerk and Surveyor. The Directors of the Company having expressed their willingness to receive the deputations they waited upon the Directors at the time and on the day above stated, and reported the result of their interview, as under:— 6th March, 1894. The deputation appointed by the Vestry report that they met and conferred with a Committee of the Directors of the Dock Company, on Tuesday last, the 29th February, with reference to the resolutions passed by the Vestry at their last meeting on the following points in the Company's proposed bill for the extension of their Docks:— " The provision of accommodation for families displaced. The insertion of a clause providing for the Company making up the deficiency in the rate during the progress, and until the completion of the works. The pitching of the new roads in the same way as the old ones, and the maintenance of them in good repair for three years from date of opening to traffic. The provision of better ingress and egress to William Street, Maynard Road and Osprey Street, which would be formed into culs de sac. The widening of the bridges so as to admit of a double line of vehicular traffic, with a footpath on either side, and the alteration at the junction of Osprey Street with the Lower Road, so as to give a better approach for vehicles. 48 And that the Directors expressed their willingness to meet the wishes of the Vestry as far as possible, and stated that they would consider the points brought before them by the deputation with the full Board of Directors, and communicate with the Vestry thereon, and that with regard to the widening of the bridges it had already been determined to make them wide enough for a double line of vehicular traffic, and that no objection would be offered to the Vestry's proposal with regard to the approach from the Lower Road to Osprey Street. (Signed) EDWARD JOSSELYN BECK. The matter had not been settled at the close of the year. Staff. At a General Meeting of the Vestry, held 18th July, 1893, in pursuance of notice given by Mr. Stuart, it was Resolved—That the question of the reorganisation of the Clerical Staff in the Vestry office bo referred to a Special Committee of the whole of the Vestry for consideration and report, the present staff being insufficient to deal with the increased work in the office. The following is a copy of the Committee's Report to the Vestry, dated the 25th October, 1893:— Your Committee have hold several meetings, and have fully discussed and considered the reference to them by the Vestry on the subject of the adequacy and reorganisation of the Vestry's Staff ; and having conferred with Mr. James Day, the present Assistant Clerk, who was willing to meet the views of the Vestry, they beg to recommend as follows:— That advertisements be issued for the appointment of an Assistant Clerk, at a salary of £170 a year, and that the person to be appointed be a thoroughly competent man who has held the position of Clerk or Assistant Clerk in a Metropolitan Vestry Office, and is well acquainted with the nature of the duties required of him; his age to be not under 30 nor over 40 years; and that upon such appointment being made, the engagement with Mr. James Day, as Assistant Clerk, be terminated; and that he be thereupon appointed second Assistant Clerk, at a salary of £140 a year. The Committee recommend that the Clerk be authorised to employ such extra temporary assistance as he may stand in need of pending the appointment of such Assistant Clerk. 49 The Committee are of opinion that the duties of the Surveyor of Sewers are such as require the employment of a strong and active man, and having regard to the age of the present Surveyor and to his long period of valuable service, and a previous Committee having conferred with Mr. Legg upon the subject, and he having expressed his willingness to resign upon a superannuation allowance; Recommend—That arrangements be made with Mr. Legg for his resignation accordingly, and that upon such resignation taking effect, he be allowed the full superannuation allowance as provided by the Act, namely, £200 per annum, being 40/60ths of his present salary. The Committee being also of opinion that it is desirable that the office and duties of the Surveyor of Pavements should be revised, and a former Committee having conferred with Mr. Thomas upon the subject, and he having expressed his willingness to fall in with the views of the Vestry, provided he be granted a suitable superannuation allowance; Recommend—That arrangements be made with Mr. Thomas for his resignation, and that upon such resignation taking effect, he be allowed a superannuation allowance of £120 a year, taking into consideration his long and valuable services during a period of 25 years, such duties requiring peculiar qualifications for the due and efficient discharge thereof. The Committee further Recommend—That one Surveyor be appointed in the place of Mr. Legg and Mr. Thomas to carry out the whole of the duties hitherto carried out by them, and any other duties that may be required of him according to a schedule of duties to be prepared and approved of by the Vestry, at a salary commencing at £300 a year, and rising by yearly sums after the first year of £20 to a maximum salary of £400 a year, he to have no claim for compensation allowance; that he be not less than 30 nor more than 40 years of age and that he be required to reside in the Parish, and devote his whole time to the duties of his office; and that advertisements for his appointment be issued accordingly.

The Committee also recommended—That the Resolution of the 4th June, 1889, be rescinded and that notice be given for that purpose accordingly. The Committee recommend—That no addition be made to the Clerical Staff of the Sanitary Department, but that the Clerk be authorised to retain the service of Mr. Sanderson for the present. The foregoing recommendations of the Committee having been approved of by the Vestry at a general meeting held 7th November, 1893, it was Resolved—That the Clerk prepare the necessary advertisements for the appointments of Assistant Clerk, Surveyor, and Sanitary Inspector, together with schedules of duties, and submit them to a meeting of the Staff Committee for approval. The Clerk accordingly prepared and submitted draft advertisements and schedules of duties to the Committee, and they having settled and approved of the same, and given instructions for their insertion in certain newspapers; A Special Committee Meeting of the Vestry was held on the 14th day of December, 1893, to receive applications for the said offices and to make a selection therefrom, to be submitted to the Vestry at a subsequent meeting, when the election was to be made. A Special Meeting of the Vestry was accordingly convened on 21st December, 1893, to make such appointments, when it was Resolved That Mr. Ernest Carr Olivier be elected and appointed Assistant Clerk to the Vestry, at a salary of £170 per annum. That Mr. Norman Scorgie be elected and appointed Surveyor to the Vestry at a salary of £300 per annum, rising by annual increments of £20 after the first year to £400 per annum; and That Mr. Thomas Lane Davies be elected and appointed Chief Sanitary Inspector to the Vestry, at a salary of £200 per annum. 51 Mr. Alfred Carter and Mr. William Wallis were appointed Assistant Sanitary Inspectors temporarily in March, 1893, and left the service of the Vestry in February, 1891 (a summary of work done by them during the time they were in the service of the Vestry, will be found on pages 24-5). Mr. Edward Thomas who had held the office of Surveyor of Pavements to the Vestry for 25 years, died in November, 1893, and at a Special Meeting of the Vestry, held 17th November, 1893, it was moved by Mr. Bisley, seconded by Mr. Young, and unanimously Resolved—That this Vestry expresses its deep sympathy and condolence with the widow and family of the late Mr. E.

In some of them alterations which have proved to be great improvements have been effected. Slaughter Houses and Cow-sheds Have been inspected twice daring the year. Messrs. W. B. Dick & Co.'s Premises, Rotherhithe Street. These works were visited many times in the course of the year, and on one occasion the Sanitary Committee inspected them. Attempts were made by various methods to prevent the escape of the nauseous fumes. The aid of experts was called in, and experiments were carried on with a view to lessening the power if not doing away altogether with the escape of the odour. Evidently the true mode of dealing with the nuisance has not yet been found out. I am, Gentlemen, yours faithfully, JOSEPHUS SHAW, Medical Officer of Health. 67 APPENDIX NO. 2.
