2 ISL 26 REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON, DURING APRIL, 1857 No. 1. One Hundred and Ninety deaths of residents in Islington were registered during the four weeks ending April 25th, and of these 100 were of persons under 20 years of age, 46 being under 1 year. During the corresponding four weeks of last year 198 deaths were registered. The mortality has thus been less, notwithstanding the increase in population. Of the total number of deaths, 37 were referred primarily to maladies of the Zymotic class. The details appear in the annexed tables. In April last year, the deaths from this class of diseases were 38. Scarlatina has occasioned fewer deaths, Measles and Hooping Cough rather more than in the corresponding weeks of last year. The diseases of the Organs of Respiration occasioned 34 of the deaths registered ; in April last year the number was 38. The general sickness among the poor, as represented by the number of new cases coming under the care of the Parochial Surgeons, has not been very great. In April last year it was 689. In the 4 weeks just terminated, 661 new cases were admitted under treatment, of which 96 belonged to the Zymotic class of diseases, and 131 were referred to Catarrh, Bronchitis or other affections of the respiratory organs. In April last year 20 cases of Measles, 6 of Scarlatina, and 11 of Hooping Cough came under treatment. The two former diseases have been therefore less prevalent during the past four weeks, while Hooping Cough has been greatly more so. The number of cases of Fever, Erysipelas, and Diarrhoea was nearly the same in the two corresponding periods. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 42, Myddelton Square, May 4th, 1857.

The Public Health of Islington during the month of May has been favourable. The number of deaths registered was 213, viz.:—117 in the West, and 96 in the East sub-district. In the corresponding period of last year, the deaths were 206, which, augmented by one-twentieth for a year's increase of population, would be 216—three above the number registered this year. In the last week of the month only 13 deaths were registered in the East sub-district. Allowing also for the difference in the number of weeks included, the mortality this month has been less by 24 than it would have been had the death-rate of April continued. The zymotic mortality (allowing again for increase of population) differed little from last year's rate. Forty deaths from this class of diseases were registered,—4 less than last month, or 15 less than if the same proportion of deaths from zymotic diseaseshad been upheld. The occurrence of warmer weather has been accompanied by a preponderance of the zymotic deaths in the East, over those in the West sub-district. The deaths from diarrhoea have also increased to 7, from 4 last month; measles, hooping-cough, and diarrhoea, have all been more fatal than in May 1856, measles having then produced 5 deaths, hooping-cough 9, and diarrhoea only 3; typhus and scarlatina, however, have been less fatal. The mortality from diseases of the respiratory organs has also been lowered from 34 in 4 weeks to 32 in 5 weeks; in the corresponding 5 weeks of last year, 43 deaths were registered from this cause. 2 Eight hundred and seven new cases of disease came under the care of the Parochial Surgeons, so that (making allowance for the difference between 5 and 4 weeks) the general sickness also among the poor has been less than last month : there has been especially a diminution in the number of cases of catarrh and other acute pulmonary affections. The cases of disease of the zymotic class show a slight increase. Had last month's rate continued 120 would have been entered, whereas the number was 128. Chicken-pox has been prevalent among children, and there has been more small-pox than was met with in the pauper practice last month. The health of the poor stands also to advantage when compared with the corresponding five weeks last year, (807 new cases against 815). Typhus and s carlet fever are less prevalent, 8 cases of the former, and 9 of the latter disease having presented themselves in May, 1856. There has been, however, more hooping-cough, (15 cases against 19) and a larger number of cases of diarrhoea (42 against 32). The atmospheric temperature (Greenwich) has been every week higher than in the corresponding period of last year;—in the 3rd and 4th weeks of the month, higher by 6 or 7 degrees. The average for the 5 weeks has been 51.9°, that of May last year was 48.6°. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer o f Health. 42, Myddelton Square, June 4th, 1857. TABLE I.

Not with standing the unusually hot weather, which has commenced producing its customary results rather early in the year, the public health in the Parish has been altogether very satisfactory. The general mortality has continued to decrease. During the four weeks ending June 27th, one hundred and sixty-two deaths were registered, including 19 on which inquests had been held during former months, and which are usually not registered until the close of the quarter. If these be excluded, the lowered mortality will appear in a still more favourable light. The deaths in the West sub-district were 84, those in the East, 78. The registered mortality of the corresponding weeks of last year was 175, which, corrected for augmented population, becomes 183. The mortality of the past month therefore, has been 21 less than if the death-rate of June last year had prevailed. Thirty-three deaths are stated to have resulted from diseases of the zymotic class, being 11 less than in the month of April, but, allowing for the number of weeks included, 1 in excess of May. The zymotic mortality of June last year was 39. so that, notwithstanding the increased population, the deaths from these diseases have been 6 less. Scarlet fever last year produced 6 deaths in June, but only 3 this year. The deaths from diarrhoea have, however, been more numerous, viz.:—6 against 4 last year. Measles, hoopingcough, and fever, all presented a much lower mortality than in May or April. It is very worthy of remark that two deaths have been registered as from chicken-pox—a disease not usually fatal, but to the prevalence of which I called attention in my last monthly report. They were thus registered—June 13th, at Stock Orchard Crescent, son of Clerk in Excise, aged 6 months; chicken-pox (4 days), congestion of the brain, convulsions (36 hours). June 14th, at 10, Albion Place, Balls Pond, son of a Carman, aged 7 months; chicken-pox (3 weeks), marasmus. The mortality from the tubercular and respiratory diseases, after making the necessary corrections, has differed little from that of the previous month. The deaths from tubercular diseases have been less by 6 than in June last year. The general sickness among the poor, making allowance for the number of weeks, has differed little from that during May. As might be anticipated, 2 however, with the high temperature that has prevailed, the cases of zymotic disease have increased by one-filth, the same number, 128, representing the cases of this class during the past 4 weeks, and duriug the 5 weeks previous. The principal increase is observed in the cases returned as fever or typhus, in diarrhoea and in chicken-pox. Of diarrhoea, 8 cases were entered in the first week of the month, 8 in the second, 12 in the third, and 25 in the fourth. Two cases were also returned as dysentery. Compared with June last year, the principal difference observable is, that while the total number of cases has been less by 31, some important zymotic diseases have been more prevalent. Thus hooping-cough has furnished 14 cases against 8 last year (although the disease has been less fatal), diarrhoea 53 against 35, and fever 13 against 9. On the other hand, there were only 13 cases of measles, against 35 in June last year, and only 2 cases of scarlet fever against 7. A case of cholera came under my notice at the begining of the month (commencing on June 1st), which recovered under the care of a private practitioner. The temperature of the month just closed has been unusually high; in the last week it is said to have exceeded the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher) by 6.9 degrees. The mean temperature of the four weeks, was 61°, that of the corresponding weeks last year, being 56.9°. The mean temperature of the last week of the month was 67.3°, or about as high as that of the hottest week (the first week in August) last year.

During the Month of July, Islington shared in the increase of sickness which has prevailed in the Metropolis, especially over the parishes constituting its Northern division. The mean temperature (Greenwich) of the five weeks of July, has been 64.7°, or three degrees higher than during the corresponding weeks of last year. The result has been an unusually early increase of zymotic sickness and mortality, especially from the diarrhoea and choleraic disorder, which the heat of summer invariably elicits. According to Mr. Glaisher, the mean temperature of the first week of the month, was 1 degree higher than the average of the same week in 43 years; in the third week it was (5.3 degrees higher; in the fourth, 6.7 degrees higher; and in the fifth, 2.3 degrees higher. An additional cause of sickness is being pointed out by the Association of Medical Officers of Health, in the diminution which the water in the rivers supplying London has been undergoing, (as measured on the weir at Stonebridge Lock, River Lea), and the increased impurity of the drinking water occasioned thereby; the impurities both in source and supply remaining the same, while their dilution is lessened. On Saturday, April 11th, the depth of water on the weir was 6.1 in.; on July 25th, it was only 2.0in. Diarrhoea has been increasing in London just in proportion as the water has lessened. During the whole of the five weeks also, the wind has been principally in the South-West, and Islington has thus been supplied with air partially damaged by having passed over London. The number of deaths registered in the five weeks was, 248, viz.—125 in the West Sub-district, and 123 in the East. In the corresponding weeks of last year, the mortality was 202, or 212, if augmented for increased population with a view to comparison with this year. The excess of 36 deaths is due to zymotic disease, diarrhoea and infantile cholera being the diseases to which it is especially attributable. Last year in the month of July, the registered deaths from diarrhoea and cholera were only 16; they have this year amounted to 57, (29 males and 28 females ) All these, with the exception of two females, aged respectively 70 and 78 years, were infants, 49 being under one year of 2 age, and 6 between 1 and 2 years; between the ages of 2 years and 70 although diarrhœa has spared no age in its attacks, not a single death was registered. The large number of cases of diarrhœa which have occurred, is also the principal cause of the high total of 1084 new cases of disease entered in the hooks of the parochial Surgeons. Hooping cough, diarrhoea and fever, have all been more prevalent than in July last year, when there were entered 12 cases of hooping cough, 135 ofdiarrhœa, and 11 of fever. Diarrhoea and fever have especially made progress during the two last weeks of the month. The following table represents this fact in its relation to atmospheric temperature. Mean Temp. (Greenwich.)

She was seized in the morning of the 19th, and was removed in the afternoon to the hospital, where she ultimately recovered. Three children in the same house had recently suffered from fever. The drains were all untrapped and extremely offensive. I directed an inspection of all the houses in the Crescent, and the result is now laid before the Committee in the customary form. Your Inspector was seized with illness immediately after spending a short time in No. 5. Six of the nine cases of fever which were entered by the Parochial Surgeons in the last week of the month, occurred in Stroud's Vale. The sanitary condition of this locality will receive immediate attention. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 42, Myddelton Square, August 6th, 1857. TABLE I.

The accompanying tables of mortality and sickness will bear, on the whole, favourable comparison with those in my July report. The total mortality has fallen from 248 in five weeks, to 176 in four weeks, and the mortality from zymotic diseases from 94 to 54. The deaths from diarrhoea have fallen from 53 to 30, and only 1 death has been registered from infantile cholera. Measles and hooping cough have also been less fatal. There have been 10 deaths from fever, 8 in the West and 2 in the East subdistrict. The deaths from "Tabes Mesenterica" (a scrofulous affection of the mesenteric glands in the abdomen), registered this month were very numerous, but the excess is probably more apparent than real. The table shows that it is confined to the East sub-district, and the greater number of the deaths were returned by one of the parochial surgeons newly appointed, Mr. Greenwood. He assures me that these cases, in which gradual emaciation was the leading condition, were never returned as mesenteric disease, except where his mind was clear as to the cause of this symptom; and he considers that, in all probability, cases of this class were formerly returned as "Atrophy." The greater number of the deaths took place in the closest and most crowded courts and lanes of the South-Eastern division of the parish. Comparing the mortality with that of August last year, the result is not discouraging. The total mortality, notwithstanding increased population, has been 10 less (176 against 186), the mortality from zymotic diseases generally 19 less (54 against 73), and that from diarrhoea and cholera 18 less (31 against 49). The deaths from fever in August last year were 9. Making allowance for the difference between five and four weeks, the general sickness among the poor, as indicated by the number of new cases attended by the parochial surgeons, has remained much the same as during July. Diarrhoea, however, has been more extensively prevalent, 324 new 2 cases having been treated daring the last four weeks against 283 in the previous five weeks. But as the deaths have greatly lessened, the disease has probably assumed a milder character. There has also been a larger number of cases of fever, 26 against 24 last month. Of these 7 occurred in Stroud's Vale. More than half the cases of fever were entered in the first week of the month. Measles and chicken-pox have nearly disappeared from the Table, but there have been 10 cases of scarlatina, all but three of which occurred in the South-Eastern parochial district. The Stroud's Vale fever cases arose at a little school, at No. 5, James' Street, to which the sister of the schoolmistress had been brought ill from an adjoining parish. Several of the children attending the school were first attacked, and carrying the disease to their several homes infected other persons. The following table is a continuation of that presented last month. Mean Temp. (Greenwich.)

Nearly all are without covers, and consequently gather every variety of impurity, while in many instances, the receptacles themselves are rotten, and the water they contain acquires, after a few hours exposure in them, so offensive an odour, that the more decent inhabitants recoil from its use for drinking purposes. Where water thus contaminated however is drunk, there can be no question as to its exerting an injurious influence on the health, and favouring the disturbance of the digestive organs which the heat of the season calls forth.

The mortality and sickness, both general and zymotic, have continued to decrease during the month of September, and this, notwithstanding that both common fever and scarlatina have been more prevalent in the parish and more fatal than they were during the spring and earlier summer months. One hundred and ninety-eight deaths from all causes were registered during the five weeks ending October 3rd. Had the death-rate of August continued, the number that I should have had to record would have been 2'20. It is even less than in the corresponding weeks of last year, when 209 were registered, to correspond with which, in accordance to the increase of population, the present table should have represented a mortality of 219. In the fourth week of the month only 10 deaths were registered in the East sub-district. The number of persons who have been carried off by diseases of the zymotic class is 54—the same number that stands against this class in the table for August; but as the latter represented only four weeks, we must conclude the zymotic mortality to be reduced. This reduction is solely due to the subsidence of summer diarrhoea, for some other zymotic and infectious maladies have been more active. Thus, scarlatina has killed 6 children and 1 adult; 13 deaths are attributed to fever, 1 to chicken pox, and 2 to infantile syphilis, a disease which there is every reason to believe should be made to bear the blame of a far larger number of infant deaths than are referred to it in our mortality returns. In the corresponding period of last year there were 21 deaths from diarrhoea, 10 from fever, and only 2 from scarlatina. The death of chicken pox was thus returned:—"7, St. George's Yard, female, 3 years, daughter of a cab proprietor; Varicella, 3 days; diarrhœa, 24 hours; convulsions, 10 hours." The death placed in the table in the horizontal column for "Rheumatic Fever" was of a doubtful character; it was thus returned:—"Vale Royal, male, 30 years, horse slaughterer. Bheumatism, with erythematous spots, subsequently large pustules in various parts, as if the blood were in a poisoned state. Duration, 16 days." This was certified by Mr. Lloyd, and as the description might apply without improbability either to malignant pustule or to farcy (both occasional diseases in the human subject), I wrote to him asking for more definite information. 2 This, however, he was unable to afford me, as satisfactory, or corroborative evidence of the introduction of an animal poison was wanting, although the trade of the individual must have laid him continually open to such infection. The weekly sickness among the poor during September has been considerably less than during August and July. The cases of diarrhoea, attended by the parish surgeons, have numbered 164: they have been very few during the last weeks of the month. The cases of fever have fallen from 24 and 26, in the two previous months, to 14. Fourteen cases of measles have been registered, which number is about the average of the previous five months. Compared with last year, this amount of sickness is certainly less—the corrected total for the corresponding five weeks being 932; the absolute number of cases of scarlatina, 3.

I have to call your attention to a circular, recently issued by the General Board of Health, upon the subject of the cholera, which, during the past summer, has been ravaging the shores of the Baltic, and which has now arrived at Hamburgh. This city, on former visitations, has been its resting-place immediately before crossing the ocean to our own island. The customary summer diarrhoea, which this year commenced unusually early and has been unusually fatal, has now nearly subsided, so that there is no ground whatever for present alarm; but still, there is a loud call for preparation. In this will consist our safety. Our experience of this fearful pestilence has been too dearly purchased for its lessons to be forgotten now. Possibly cholera may not appear among us this year—possibly not at all; but neither you nor I, with the responsibilities which lie upon us, can dare to neglect the warning of its proximity. You cannot place yourselves in the attitude of defence too soon: you may delay until too late. My present advice is that the Sanitary Committee consider, at an early period, the arrangements which it may be desirable to make in the event of an outbreak in London, and receive full powers from the Vestry to take any necessary measures that emergency may demand.

But little alteration has, on the whole, taken place in the public health in Islington during the past month. The number of deaths registered, namely, 158, presenting the same weekly mean as those in September. The difference in the tables of mortality lies in a diminution of the fatality of diarrhœa and fever, and an increase of that from the various diseases of the chest. Nor has the public health been so good as in October last year, when the total mortality corrected for increased population, was 10 less, the zymotic mortality 4 less, and that from respiratory disease 12 less. As respects diarrhoea, it is to be observed that while the deaths occasioned by it have fallen from 18 to 8 in the month, those which occurred in October, last year, were but 4 in number. Fever has happily declined, only 2 deaths from this cause having occurred, against 13 in last month, and 7 in the corresponding weeks last year. The number of cases of disease, entered by the parochial Surgeons, has scarcely varied from the rate observed in September, when allowance is made for the difference between 5 or 4 weeks, but has been less by 51 than in October last year. The new cases of diarrhoea have fallen from 164 to 59, almost the precise number attended in October last year. It is to be presumed, however, from the difference in the mortality from this disease, that it is less mild in its character. Diseases of the chest are now beginning to swell the applications for medical relief. The condition of Stroud's Vale, where fever has of late been very prevalent, and where the mortality from zymotic diseases is always excessive, has engaged the attention of the Inspector, during the last month. I have also visited the greater part of it myself, and have been shocked at the glaring outrages of all sanitary laws perpetrated through nearly all the locality. I cannot say I am surprised at the result of the inquiry, for so greatly disproportionate a number of deaths from zymotic diseases in any district point, to the existence of these deficiencies as certainly as the needle to the pole. For the details I must refer you to the inspection sheets, and my appended recommendations, but cannot avoid directing your special attention to the almost complete absence of proper drainage in that densely populated portion of the vale which lies to the north of the Great Northern Railway. Unless this be placed in a satisfactory state before the next outbreak of epidemic sickness, I will not answer for the consequences of the neglect.

The average temperature of November during 15 years (from 1841 to 1855) is stated to be 43.8°, and the degree of humidity 88. Last year the mean temperature of November was 40.7° and the degree of humidity 88. As respects the public health, the month has been mainly remarkable for the epidemic prevalence of catarrh, involving commonly the lungs and air passages, and accompanied, in many cases, by much prostration of strength. The latter condition characterizes the malady as " influenza" and is that which chiefly distinguishes it from ordinary catarrh. To this must be attributed the large number of new cases (863) which have applied for treatment to the Parochial Medical Officers during the 4 weeks, exceeding by 194 the new entries in November last year. Of this number 363, or 42 per cent., consisted of cases of catarrh, bronchitis and other acute pulmonary affections: 37 of them were entered in the books as " influenza," against 10 thus entered last year. The latter were probably cases more prostrated than the rest, but there can be no question, from the experience of returns made in former epidemics of this kind, that the cases entered as catarrh, bronchitis, &c., are in great part instances of the same malady, where perhaps the nervous and muscular depression were less marked at the outset. Measles and hooping-cough have increased since October, the former from 14 to 20 cases, the latter from 8 to 20. Last year in November 35 cases of measles were entered, but none of hooping-cough. Twenty-one cases of continued fever have been admitted from various parts of Islington into the London Fever Hospital since the middle of September. All of these were cases of "typhoid" fever—a variety characterized by peculiar changes in the glandular apparatus of the small intestines. One of the cases of fever occurred in Albert Square, and is the fourth that has occurred in one family during the last few months. I have inquired of several medical practitioners and cannot learn that any case of " diphtherite" has occurred in Islington. The registered mortality of the month has been 198, that of November last year was 193; it is probable that an increase of 1/20 has since then been added to our population, so that the same rate of mortality in the present year would have been represented by 202 deaths, or 4 in excess of those which have actually been registered. As respects the zymotic mortality generally, we are certainly in a more favourable position than we were this time last year, when the deaths from zymotic diseases were 47, while they have this year been only 37. The difference is remarkable in the mortality from measles, 5 deaths against 10 last year; in scarlatina, 4 against 7 last year; and fever, 5 against 8 last year. The only excess is in hooping cough, where the deaths have been 9 against 5: 3 deaths from "influenza" have been recorded, while only one was thus designated last year. The number of deaths attributed to diseases of the respiratory organs is 54, in November last year it was 44. Although only three deaths are stated in the returns to be due to "influenza," there can be little question that the excess of deaths of the class we are considering is due to the same morbid influence. Of the deaths referred to "influenza," one occurred in a child aged 2 years, and the others in persons aged respectively 84 and 85 years. Of the deaths stated to have occurred from bronchitis and pneumonia, 29 took place under 4 years of age and 12 over 60 years. The past month has been unusually fatal to the aged inhabitants of the parish, 36 persons died between 60 and 80 years of age, and 14 at ages over 80; last year in November, only 5 died above 80 years of age. Of the 14 above 80 years, 5 were males, all but one in easy circumstances and aged respectively 80, two 82, 84 and 85; and 9 females, mostly in easy circumstances, aged respectively 82, two 83, two 84, 85, 87, 91 and 94, the two last of no specified disease but absolutely worn out by a prolonged existence.

The registered mortality of December has been 286; but this includes 9 deaths respecting which Inquests were held in October and November. Allowing, however, for these, the weekly mortality has been higher than that of last month. The deaths registered in the corresponding five weeks of last year were 249.' Raising this viz.: to 261 for comparison with the present return, we find that the deaths have this year presented an excess over last year of 25, The excess principally refers to the deaths in the early periods of life: the deaths under 20 years of age in December last year were 113; this year they have been 158. The deaths from zymotic diseases have risen to 62, of which 38 occurred in the West sub-district, where measles and hooping-cough have together occasioned 21 deaths. The deaths from pulmonary diseases (exclusive of phthisis) are lessened by one-fifth, and are less by ten than they were in December last year. Two deaths have been specially referred to influenza. Nine deaths have been registered as from fever, six in the West, and three in the East sub-district. The unusual circumstance deserves to be noted, that this month the deaths in the East sub-district have been altogether more numerous than in the West, while the zymotic mortality has been less, and that from tubercular diseases higher. The deaths from diseases of the organs of respiration have been, during November and December, about equal in the two sub-districts. The entries of new cases by the Parochial Surgeons have fallen from 863 in the four weeks of November to 788 in the five weeks just terminated. The latter, when allowance is made for our augmenting population, is nearly the same number as was entered in the corresponding weeks of last year. Of the ordinary zymotic diseases, it appears from the Table that hooping-cough still continues prevalent, but a reduced number of cases of measles has been observed, and only six cases of fever are recorded. The type of fever remains the same. In December last year, 56 cases of measles, 4 of scarlatina, 5 of hooping-cough, 28 of diarrhoea, and 9 of fever were entered. The sum of these cases is 102, while this year the sum of the cases of these diseases is 66. It will be observed that the cases of diseases of the organs of respiration, including 19 cases designated " Influenza," have been reduced from 363 in four weeks, to 255 in five weeks.

Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians; Fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London; and late Lecturer on the Practice of Medicine at the School adjoining St. George's Hospital; MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. LONDON: J. & I. TIREBUCK, PRINTERS AND LITHOGRAPHERS, Monkwell Street, City, and Islington. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, 1. There is little that I need say by way of introduction to my Second Annual Report. The assistance which I have received in various quarters, and my own increasing experience in the matters relating to my office, have combined in rendering this summary of the Sanitary condition of Islington in some respects, as it will probably be regarded, more perfect than that which I last year had the honour to submit. On the whole, you will, doubtless, consider there is no ground for dis-satisfaction. The mortality has been even below that of 1856, and extensive improvements have been effected in some of the warst-conditioned dwellings of the poor. MORTALITY AND DEATH-RATE. 2. The more important particulars relating to the mortality of the parish are embodied in the Tables appended to this Report. These Tables have been formed from the returns furnished to the General Register office from the Registrars of Births and Deaths for our Sub-Districts, and which, during the past year, have been regularly forwarded to me from Somerset House. I take this opportunity of expressing the obligation under which I lie to the Registrar-General for the only data on which I could presume to furnish an account of the sanitary condition of the parish. Between the 1st of January and the 31st ot December, 1857—2410 persons died in Islington, exclusive of strangers from other parishes, who were mentioned as such in the District Registrar's returns, and who died in the various hospitals situated within the parish.* There must be added as a correction to this mortality, 146 deaths, the proportion which Islington from its population may be presumed to furnish to the deaths that have occurred during the year in the General and Special Hospitals, Lying-in Hospitals, and Lunatic Asylums of the Metropolis. This addition will raise the mortality for 1857 to 2556. The births which have been registered in Islington during the year have been 4591, as shown by the subjoined Table. West Sub-district. East Sub-district. Whole Parish. Males. Females. Both Sex Males. Females. Both Sex. Males. Females. Both Sex. 1st quarter 314 291 605 316 254 570 630 545 1175 2nd ,, 303 275 578 273 261 534 576 536 1112 3rd „ 281 304 585 281 244 525 562 548 1110 4th „ 318 299 617 305 272 577 623 571 1194 Total 1216 1169 2385 1175 1031 2206 2391 2200 4591 Assuming that the reproductive character of our population has not altered since the last census, this number of Births represents a population of 143,830 persons, distributed between the Sub-districts in the proportion of 74,976 persons in the West, and 68,854 in the East.† The death-rate for the whole period then has been 177 in the 1,000 of those living.‡ *Since the Great Northern Hospital in Maiden Lane has been established, a number of patients dying there have been reckoned among the deaths of residents, because the places from which they had come were not mentioned in the returns; probably many of these should have been omitted. †This mode of computing the population of so rapidly and irregularly growing a district as this is more likely to give correct results than that which I have hitherto used, founded on the increase between 1841 and 1851. ‡By referring to Table VI. it will he seen how much in certain streets, &c., (marked *), the population of which has been ascertained, this death-rate is exceeded. 4 The mortality of 1856, had it taken place in a population equal to that of 1857, would have amounted to 2,594, so that we may consider, notwithstanding some unfavourable circumstances, our mortality has been less by 38 than during the previous year. 3. Distributing the corrected mortality between the Sub-districts, that of the West was 1,371, or 18.2 per 1,000 living; and 1,185 in the East, or 17.2 per 1,000 living. In either case the Death-rate has been low, but the West Sub-district has this year exhibited the higher mortality. 4. The greatest number of deaths (68) occurred in the fiftieth week, that ending December 12th, the next highest weekly mortality was in the thirtieth week, ending July 25th. The smallest number of deaths (30) took place in the twenty-fourth week, ending June 13th. Table 3 shows the total weekly mortality, and that from certain important diseases. 5. Mortality of the Sexes. Of the 2,410 deaths, particulars of which I possess, 1,145 were of Males, and 1,265 of Females. In relation to the number of each sex living in 1851, however, the mortality in the Male population must be considered to have really been in excess of that in the Female by 65; the greater part of this excess viz. 43, being observed in the East Sub-district. CAUSES OF DEATH. Table 1,* at the end of this Report, exhibits the diseseas from which the mortality of the year has arisen. As usual, the zymotic class of maladies occupies the most prominent position among the causes of death; next to it stand the tubercular diseases; and below them the diseases of the lungs, exclusive of consumption. a. Zymotic Diseases † 6. Five hundred and fifty-three or 22.9 per cent. of all the deaths which occurred in Islington, were attributed to diseases of this class. This per centage is lower than last year's. The proportion of deaths from these diseases has also been lower in London at large. In the West Sub-district these deaths formed 22.4 of the whole number that occurred; in the East Sub-district 23.4. Allowing for all the fallacies attendant upon this mode of estimating the comparative sanitary condition of the two Sub-districts, one cannot avoid observing the reduction from 27'0 per cent. last year to 23.4 in the East, and the rise by 2 per cent. in the West. One source of fallacy, which the study of this year's Tables forces upon me, lies in the different manner in which the mortality has, in the two Sub-districts, affected the different ages. A very large proportion of the zymotic sickness which proves fatal falls upon children under five years of age, and it is clear that the per centage of these deaths will be consequently reduced where from any cause the adult mortality is increased. Now on comparing the adult mortality (especially at the more advanced ages) with the population of 1851 in each Sub-district, you cannot fail to be struck with the discrepancy that exists. It may be partly explained by the fact of persons *This Table is a summary of more extended Tables in which the mortality is referred to each Subdistrict, distinguishing the sexes, and the age at death in quinquennial periods, and at each quarter of the year, prepared for future use. It is a tabulation quite distinct from that employed for my Monthly Reports, as also from that for the Weekly mortality, (Table 3). The former recognized the deaths as they were registered—this and the last mentioned, as they have occurred. †"This class comprises diseases which have been observed to be epidemic, endemic, or contagious. The blood is probably, in the greater number of them, the primary seat of disease; and they may be considered, by hypothesis, the result of specific poisons of organic origin, either derived from without or generated within the body."—Statistical Nosology, 1845, p. 14. 5 from the East Sub-district being received into the Workhouse, which is in the West Sub-district, and dying there. Of course, it is impossible to say whether or no the population is distributed, as to age, in the Sub-districts in the same manner as it was in 1851, but we must assume that it is in any estimate of the mortality that we can form. Column 23, in Table IV. shows the proportion of the deaths from zymotic disease in Islington and its Sub-districts to each 1,000 of persons estimated as living in each in 1857. It will be observed how trifling is the difference thus appreciable. 7. The greatest number of deaths, from this class of diseases, which occurred in one week was 36, and this was in that ending July 25th, when 65 deaths from all causes took place. Last year the highest weekly number was 21, and this mortality happened a month later. The cause of this, in the early and excessive heat of the summer, was pointed out in my Monthly Reports. The mortality from zymotic diseases was at its minimum in the fifth week of the year, when only 2 deaths occurred out of a total of 50 from all causes. 8. The number of deaths from each of the more important zymotic diseases, and the proportion that they bear to the deaths from all causes, appear in Table IV. Measles and Hooping Cough appear to have differed but little in fatality from last year's rate; the little difference observable is by way of excess. In the case of the former the percentage was greatest in the West Sub-district, in the latter disease, in the East. January, April, May, and December, were the months on which the greater number of deaths from Measles occurred; Hooping Cough being most fatal in April, May, November, and December. There has been decidedly less Scarlatina than last year, when the per centage of all deaths was 3.312. It has this year fallen to 2 116; still, however, retaining, as it would appear, its preference for the East Sub-district. Fever has been fatal to a larger number of persons than in 1856. The population has increased 1/13th, the deaths from Fever 1/7th. Out of 84 deaths, 54 occurred in the West Sub-district. I have already* had occasion to point out the cause of the spread of this disease in the West Sub-district. The greatest monthly mortality from Fever occurred in August and September, in each of which months Fever carried off 11 persons. In June and October it only destroyed 3 persons; in each of the other months of the year from 6 to 8. There has also been a higher mortality from diarrhœa, in connection with the excessive heat of the summer. Of the 139 deaths from this disease, the larger number, viz. 73, occurred in the East Sub-district—while 66 occurred in the West. Now, comparing this with last year's Table, one cannot help observing that the excess of fatal diarrhœa over that of last year is attributable to the deaths that look place in the West Sub-district alone. I may be wrong in my explanation, for one cannot draw conclusions with too much modesty and diffidence, but it is difficult to dissociate this exemption from increased fatality in the East Sub-district, (an increase which was observed to the extent of more than 1 per cent. in London generally) from the fact that some of the worst-conditioned streets and courts in this part of the parish, underwent improvement in 1856 and the early part of 1857. As to the increase in the West Sub-district., I shall endeavour to point out presently in what portion of the district the fatality was most remarkable. The deaths from diarrhoea rose from 4 in the first week of July to 9 in the second week, and 10 in the third week ; on the fourth week of July, that ending July 25th, (when the highest weekly mortality for the summer, both general and zymotic occurred), 17 deaths from diarrhoea took place. The decline of the disease was much more gradual. Even in October 10 deaths from diarrhoea occurred against 4 in that month last year. 9. AVith a view more accurately to localise the mortality from various causes, I have repeated, in a somewhat expended form, the Table 3 in my Report for 1856. This distribution of the deaths, with that into the several streets, involves, of course, * Monthly Reports, Nos. 5 and 6. 6 a distinct tabulation, but the information obtained by this means is so valuable that it amply repays the labour it requires. See Tables V. and VI. Recollecting that the proportion of deaths from zymotic disease in the parish generally was 22 9 per cent. of all deaths, it appears that Wards 1, 5, 6, and 7, exhibit a proportion of zymotic deaths decidedly below this mean. Barnsbury Ward occupies among these the most distinguished place; it held the same position last year . The Wards in which the deaths from these diseases have exceeded the mean, are Wards 2, .4, and 8. Ward 3 has greatly improved since last year, when it stood very low in this respect. The proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases stands this year at about the mean for the whole parish. Lower Holloway and Thornhill* Wards exhibit these deaths at, severally, 27.5 per cent. and 26.5 per cent. of those from all causes. Measles exceeded in fatality the mean for the parish generally, in Wards 2, 4, and 8, chieliy in Lower Holloway, where it was twice as fatal as in the Parish at large. Thornhill Ward was little behind it. Hooping Covgh was most fatal in Highbury Ward; it exceeded the mean, more or less, also in Thornhill and St. Peter's. Diarrhœa was most fatal in St. Mary's Ward, next in Lower Holloway and St. Peter's, and after these in Highbury and Thornhill Wards. The deaths from Fever exceeded the average in St. Mary's, Barnsbury, and Thornhill Wards. In Table VI. you will see the streets in each Ward in which fatal zymotic disease decidedly exceeded the mean for the whole parish. I have omitted all those streets where only one death occurred. I commend this list to your careful study. Many of the localities mentioned have undergone a sanitary inspection under my direction, and are already under orders for improvement from the Sanitary Committee. b. Tubercular Diseases. 10. The tubercular class of diseases, represented among children chiefly by mesenteric disease and hydrocephalus, and among adults by phthisis, or pulmonary consumption, carried off during the year 436 persons, or 18 per cent. of those who died from all causes, and 3.03 in every 1,000 of our population. Of these deaths, 239 occurred in the West, and 197 in the East Sub-district; in the former they constituted 18.6 per cent. of all the deaths, and in the latter 17.6 per cent.: 209 were males, and 227 females. Comparing the mortality from these diseases with the population of each Sub-district, it appears that they were during the year fatal to 3.18 in every 1,000 in the West, and 2 86 per 1,000 living in the East Sub-district. The proportion of deaths from this class of diseases has been precisely the same as last year, and the West Sub-district still continues to exhibit them in excess of the East. 11. Phthisis alone was fatal to 294 persons, or to 2.04 in every 1,000 of those living. The deaths from this disease constituted 12.1 per cent. of all the deaths in the year : 137 were males, and 157 females. If we assume the sexes to be, as in 1851, in the relation of 100 males to 123 females, then the females, considering the numbers living, have suffered less from phthisis than the males; for in this proportion there should have died 168 females from this disease. In the West Sub-district 175 died from phthisis, or 2 33 per 1,000 of those living, and 13.5 per cent. of all deaths. Of these 83 were males and 92 females, (again an excess of male deaths: those of females in relation to their number living should have been 98†). In the East Sub-district, 119 died from phthisis, or 1.72 per 1,000 of the population, and 10.6 per cent of all deaths: 54 were males, and 65 females. The females from the number living,‡ should, to correspond with the male deaths have been 68. *I have no question that I placed Thornhill Ward in too favourable a position last year. A great many of the deaths from zymotic diseases which I was unable to refer to this Ward occurred in Strouds Yale, and my difficulty arose out of my ignorance of the names of the several cottages, &c., which constitute that locality. 100 males to 119 females. ‡100 males to about 127 females. 7 It thus appears that while little variation in the per centage of deaths from phthisis has taken place since last year, the West Sub-district continues to present the higher mortality from this disease. 12. As with the mortality from diseases of the zymotic class, Tables V. and VI. show where that from tubercular diseases and from phthisis has been principally observed. As respects the whole class, Wards 1, 4, 6, and 8 have, more or less, exceeded the mean for the whole parish, Upper Holloway and St. Mary's Wards being the most remarkable in this respect; Canonbury, Lower Holloway, and Barnsbury presenting the smallest proportion to all the deaths that occurred in them. With respect to phthisis, the mortality exceeded the mean in Wards 1 and 6 only; it closely approached the mean in Wards 4 and 5; and was greatly below it in Lower Holloway and Canonbury Wards. There are so many circumstances to be taken into consideration in estimating the value of these results, that I shall content myself at present with merely recording them. c. Diseases of the Organs of Respiration. 13. Four hundred and twenty-two persons—200 males, and 222 females died during the year of affections, mostly inflammatory, of the lungs and other organs engaged in the function of respiration. This was 17.5 per cent. of all the deaths which occurred in the parish, and 2 93 per 1,000 of all living. In the West Sub-district the number was 241, or 18.6 per cent. of all deaths, and 3.21 per 1000 of the population, and in the East 181, or 16 2 per cent. of all deaths, and 2.62 per 1,000 of those living. The mortality from these diseases has thus been 0.5 per cent. higher than last year, the excess being partly due to the slight prevalence of Influenza at the latter end of the year. It appears from Table V., that the largest proportion of deaths from diseases of this class occurred in Thornhill Ward, which alone materially exceeded the mean mortality of the parish. It appears to have impressed upon the West Sub-district the excess of mortality from respiratory diseases which it exhibits. AGE AT DEATH. 14. The more extended manner in which I have tabulated the deaths this year enables me to enter at greater length into this important subject than I did in my last year's report. In Table I. the deaths are arranged in periods of one year up to the age of 5 years, then in quinquennial periods up to 15 years, and then onwards in bi-quinquennial periods. It will be interesting while studying this Table to compare it with the corresponding Table in my last year's report. I desire especially to direct your attention to the deaths of children under 5 years 0f age —of those who are to form a considerable portion of the future population of the parish—and on whose healthiness now will greatly depend the capability to labour and of self-support when they arrive at maturer years. Recollect that the causes of mortality operate still more extensively in debilitating those who do not die under their influence, and in predisposing them to suffer from the various unhealthy conditions to which they may be unavoidably exposed in future life. 15. The following Table represents the infant mortality of the parish and its subdistricts, the proportion borne by the deaths under 5 years to the mortality at all ages, to the population under 5 years in 1851, and to the assumed population under 5 years in 1857; and it also shows the proportion borne by the deaths under 1 year to the births which have taken place, and the proportion of the latter deaths that occurred during the first 3 months of existence. 8 DEATHS UNDER 5 YEARS OF AGE.

Some of you who have not been in the habit of studying the returns issued by the Registrar-General, may be unprepared for such results, or may have imagined that the infant mortality you have read of, must have been confined to less healthy localities than Islington. But here it is at your own threshold; each death representing the hovering between life and death of many more children, of whom some, at that very time, receive the sentence which dooms them, after a sickly existence, to become early prey to the maladies which await them in advancing life. Does it not become us to think of all this, and to ask how it is that so many who must be believed to be born, that they may become useful to their generation, are thus lost to that object for which they appear in the world? It is irrelevant to reply as some do when such facts are urged upon them, that the race is improved by the death of the weakly ones. What makes them weakly? Do *Of course these numbers are only ventured as an approximation to the truth, being computed on the assumption that our population under five years of age bears the same proportion to those living at all ages as in 1851. 9 none but the weakly thus succumb ? Is this mode of argument, which it is reported leads the savage to the destruction of his offspring, worthy of our boasted civilization? 16. By referring to Table II. and casting the eye down the columns of totals for the whole parish, the relative frequency in the operation of each disease causing death under 5 years of age, under 1 year, and under 3 months, is readily ascertained. By comparing the items of these columns horizontally, it become apparent how large ft proportion of the deaths of children took place within the first year of life, and again how many of the latter in the first three months. A similar comparison may be made for the Sub-districts, and for the sexes. I shall content myself by soliciting your study of this table. You will observe that the following diseases are returned as the occasion of the greater number of the deaths. Diseases of the organs of respiration of an acute character 210 Diarrhœa 120 Hooping-cough 90 Measles 75 Atrophy 72 Convulsions 69 Hydrocephalus 67 Debility from premature birth 45 Teething45 Violent deaths 44 Tabes mesenterica 40 Scarlatina 32 How many of these children might have been preserved to an useful life, if poverty had not engendered apathy and ignorance neglect ? How much infant mortality throughout the country might in future be avoided, were the poor man's dwelling pervaded by a sweeter atmosphere ? how much were the daughters of the poor not merely instructed in our schools but educated,—educated to refuse the evil and choose the good; educated to the homely work of that station of life to which each future wife and mother is destined ? how much, if the State were to withdraw its patronage from the nostrum-monger, and to discountenance the sale of infant poisons? If ever this opprobium of our civilization is to be wiped off, the clergyman, the district visitor, and the schoolmistress, must join in the efforts of the professional sanitarian. 17. Tables V. and VI. show where during the year the infant mortality has been most remarkable. You cannot fail to notice, in how many instances the locality of high infant mortality has corresponded with that of high mortality from zymotic diseases. SICKNESS. 18. Notwithstanding the very high value which must be attached to the death-rate of a district, and to the returns of mortality within it from various diseases, it must be confessed that it fails to represent fully its sanitary condition. It shows accurately enough the number of cases of disease which terminate in one particular way, but it fails to tell of all those which terminate in recovery, or in imperfect restoration to health. And yet, these constitute by far the largest proportion of those attacks of disease, which either run their course untended, or are submitted to the control and guidance of medical art. In the present day, and in our metropolis, with all the provision that is made for the medical relief of the poor, as but few persons die who have not been previously seen by some medical practitioner, so probably but few of the really sick, I mean of those who are so ill as to be debarred from following their occupations, or whose lives are seriously embittered by bodily suffering, have not the advantage of medical advice. If then, it were possible to collect the experience of the profession from time to time, we should be in possession of a mass of facts from which we might positively declare how many persons were sick, from what complaints, and with what result. As, however, a variety of considerations debar us from obtaining at present this valuable and desirable information, we are driven to the adoption of some expedient, which may furnish at least an indication by which our estimate derived from the mortality may be corrected and rendered more available to our purpose. If the whole of the sickness of the district cannot be ascertained 10 with precision, a portion of it can ; and with this view I applied, on my appointment as your Health Officer, for permission to examine the weekly return of cases of disease, which came under the notice of the medical gentlemen appointed to attend to the poor in the Workhouse, and to the out-door paupers. On this, as on every subsequent occasion, when it has been necessary for me to request the aid of the Board of Trustees, my application was met by immediate acquiescence. I should, indeed, be failing in my duty, were I to omit my acknowledgments and thanks for their very valuable assistance; as also the obligation I am under to all the parochial medical officers for their courtesy and co-operation. I am this year, enabled to furnish a a complete statement of the number of cases of disease which have been attended by these gentlemen ; and in a Table (p. 17) have furnished the particulars, and endeavoured to exhibit the proportion of all cases which each of the more important forms of disease furnished in each of the parochial medical districts. But it must not be forgotten, that this is the sickness among the very poor. Each class of society suffers not alike from the various forms of disease; we should be wrong in arguing from this table as to the extent to which each malady or group of maladies has affected those in comfortable circumstances ; although we may infer that diseases, prevalent in the one class, have been also prevalent to some, though not to the same degree, in the other class. During a portion of the year I have also been favoured by a weekly return from the Holloway and North Islington Dispensary, kindly compiled with much care, and forwarded with great regularity by their very praiseworthy resident officer, Mr. Whittingham. I regret that, as the details do not embrace the whole year, I cannot avail myself of them in the present Report. I have also received a weekly statement from Dr. Scurrah, in respect of the London Fever Hospital. If I could obtain a similar statement from the oldest medical charity in the parish—the Islington Dispensary—I should be able to form a tolerably complete return of the sickness amongst the poor. I regret to say, however, that no book or other record is kept at that Institution, wherein the diseases of the patients are entered; and the authorities there have refused to furnish me with any information as to the cases of disease attended during the year on behalf of that Institution. The number of cases attended on behalf of the parish by the medical officers of the workhouse and Infant poorhouse, and by the gentlemen who have the out-door paupers in their charge, was 9,432, viz. 749 at the workhouse, 115 at the Infant poorhouse, and 8,568 out of doors. The mortality among the last-mentioned patients, who, of course, were from those who form the poorest of our population, was 259, or 1 in 33 cases. At the Holloway and North Islington Dispensary, in addition to 503 cases left over from the previous year, there have been admitted between the 1st of January and 31st December, 6,649 patients more or less incapacitated by illness.* Of these 79 died, or 1 in 84 cases. The lower mortality must be attributed to the fact, that although there are many very poor persons attended, yet a very large number are so situated as to enjoy some of the comforts of life, although unable to meet the accidental expenses which sickness occasions. This mortality seems somewhat small for a Dispensary, inasmuch as it appears that during the year ending March, 1856, the mortality was 1 in 73, and in that ending March, 1857, it was 1 in 72 admissions. At the Islington Dispensary it appears also from the last published report, that during the whole period of its existence (36 years) 2,275 patients have died out of 161,700 admitted, which also gives a close approximation to the same proportion, viz. 1 in 71 cases. 19. There are a few points with regard to the particulars furnished in Table VII. upon which I wish to make a few remarks. 1.° As to the sickness generally.—It will be observed that about one in every five cases was an instance of a disease belonging to the zymotic class, and about another fifth of all the cases were instances of diseases of the organs of respiration, mostly of an acute character. *This does not include: several hundreds of casual cases. 11 2.° Out of the 749 inmates of the workhouse who applied to the medical officers for advice, only 12 per cent. were cases of zymotic disease, while as large a number as 27 per cent. were suffering from diseases of the organs of respiration; the low proportion in the former instance is due to the exclusion to a great degree of children from the population, and the high proportion in the latter instance to the tendency in this climate of persons beyond the middle age (of which the population of the establishment largely consists) to such affections.* 3.° Of the 115 cases which occurred in the Infant Poor-house, it is to be observed that only 2 were cases of zymotic diseases, and these did not spread, although infectious, beyond the children first attacked. This fact must be coupled with the consideration that the inhabitants of this house are taken from the class of persons who, out-of-doors, furnished the cases of small pox, measles, scarlatina, hooping cough, diarrhoea, &c., mentioned in the first column.† There was not a single case of diarrhoea all the autumn ; and throughout the year there were only 2 cases, and those mild ones, of pulmonary ailment (exclusive of the 1 fatal case of consumption.) The other diseases were mostly skin affections of various kinds imported from without. There can be no question whatever that this immunity from disease, and especially from zymotic disease, is due to the very excellent arrangements in that establishment, the airiness of the dormitories, and the active supervision which I know is exercised over the children by the accomplished medical officer of the institution, Mr. Kesteven. The mortality of the year was only 2. 4.° With respect to the out-door poor it is to be remarked, that the medical districts which materially exceeded the mean of 20 per cent. of zymotic diseases, were the Northern and North-Western. The former district adjoins the latter, and practically includes but few patients beyond the railway bridge. The proportion in the Northern was nearly 28 per cent ; in the North-Western 26 per cent. The localities of principal zymotic sickness thus correspond pretty nearly with the two Wards, Lower Holloway and Thornhill, (including Strouds Yale,) where the mortality was observed to be highest from these maladies. Measles have prevailed chiefly in the Northern and North-Western and South-Western divisions; and hooping cough in the Northern and North-Western, especially in the latter. Diarrhoea was also most extensively prevalent in the NorthWestern division. It exceeded the mean of 11 per cent. also in the Northern, South-Western. and South-Eastern divisions. The Northern, North-Western, and South-Western districts also furnished the largest number of cases of fever. This apparent unhealthiness of the North-Western division, when carefully examined, is found to be due to Strouds Vale, and some other crowded streets, in its immediate neighbourhood. The greatest number of cases of respiratory disease, proportionally to all cases of every kind, was noticed in the NorthWestern division, the South-Western closely approaching it. This again corresponds with the high mortality from this class of diseases in Thornhill Ward. 20. It may be interesting also to know, that out of 212 cases of small-pox admitted into the Small-Pox Hospital, 20 entered it from various parts of this parish ; of these, 3 died. They entered at various periods from the 1st to the 7th day of eruption, most of these, however, on the 2nd or 3rd day. I am indebted for this information to Mr. Marson, the Resident Medical Officer, who politely permitted me to examine the hospital books. SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE YEAR. 21. The following statement exhibits the amount of work done by your inspectors, and under their superintendence during the past year—in respect to house *The mortality for the year was 105. † I am informed that the mean duration of children in this establishment, exclusive of orphans, is about six months. 12 improvements. They have visited and inspected, and reported fully upon the sanitary condition of 2,213 dwellings, and have superintended the several amendments which have been effected in them and the other dwellings where the improvements were not complete in 1856, although the necessary notices had been served. Taking the whole parish, 527 new drains have been constructed, 524 improved or repaired, and 1,439 trapped; 1,104 cesspools (including, in the West Sub-division, a considerable number of open privies, with receivers) abolished, and 12 cleansed and dis-infected; 843 open privies have been furnished with pan, trap, and water supply; and 354 with pan and trap only, while 282 privies, hitherto unsupplied with water, have been furnished with this essential improvement, on the necessity of it being pointed out. 721 dust bins have been constructed and 328 covered, in accordance with the requirements of the Act of Parliament; in 834 instances wet and dirty yards of dwellings-houses have been improved by paving or appropriate surface drainage; 132 new receptacles for water (butts or cisterns) have been furnished where the old ones were decayed or insufficient in capacity; 141 repaired or cleansed, and a water supply laid on to 11 houses which were previously unprovided with it; 101 houses have been repaired generally; 268 dirty houses cleansed or limewashed ; and lastly, but not least in importance, 94 dwellings in the Eastern Sub-district have been ventilated, in some instances by the introduction of a window, in others of an air brick in a convenient situation. The power to enforce this improvement so essential in the small dwellings of the poor, has been recognised by the magistrates, who compelled the owner of some dwellings in Swan Yard, who was summoned under the Nuisances Removal Act, upon my certificate, to make the alterations in a manner that would satisfy me as to their efficiency. In all the other instances the service of the ordinary notice has produced compliance. 22. In several instances the owners of dwelling-houses have been summoned upon my certificate, for permitting the over crowding of their houses, and in every instance the magistrate has convicted and fined the offenders. It is here especially that I have felt the greatest difficulty in tendering my advice to the Sanitary Committee. Strictly speaking, every house is over crowded where, taking the means of ventilation into account, the quantity of air in it or in any room of it is so small in comparison with its inmates, that the contamination it undergoes by exhalation from the lungs and bodies of the occupants, renders it poisonous. If this definition, however, were applied with severity to the interpretation and practical application of the Nuisances Removal Act, there is scarcely a tenement in the parish which your inspectors have visited which might not be made the subject of a summons. In putting, therefore, into operation the clause of the Act relating to this cause of unhealthiness, it was necessary to take very low ground. To preserve the health of the inmates of the Pentonville Prison, it has been considered necessary to supply each man in his cell with 800 cubic feet of air, and to renew this completely every 16 or 20 minutes. I have not examined and measured the apartment of any poor family residing in the small tenements in this parish, where I suspected its crowded condition to be the occasion of disease in which the capacity exceeded 662 feet per head, without any provision for the renewal of the air. In some instances I have met with as little as 220, 198, 190, 189, 170, 167, 142, and even 135, cubic feet only allowed to each occupant of a room, where every additional person's presence was a material item in still further diminishing the amount of air within the apartment; where the atmosphere reeking with the effluvia from filthy clothes, and with the exhalation from the lungs, skin, and excretions of its occupants, never was, and never could be completely changed; and where, in some instances, the window being never opened, the room was locked up when left in the morning until re-entered to be slept in at night. The late investigation into the sanitary condition of the army has demonstrated, beyond all chance of successful contradiction, that the frightful mortality of the soldiers, while in barracks at home, is mainly due to the crowded and ill-ventilated dormitories in which they pass the night; and what is the quantity of air allowed to each man in these poisonous rooms ? We are told that it is 450 cubic feet, in many instances' less 13 than this by 5, in some less by ½. If this is the effect which crowded apartments produce upon men in the prime of life, robust in frame, and previously free from disease, what operation must they exert upon those who are less healthy, and upon the delicate frames of children, and especially how fatally they must guide the course of disease ? Can you calculate, then, the sickness and permature death that must be dealt out among our population, where such extreme instances of over cro.vding, as I have instanced, are to be met with? I have felt it my duty to advise the Sanitary Committee to put the powers it is entrusted with into operation, in every instance where the capacity of the apartments inspected was found below 300 cubic feet per head. The difficulty in assuming a higher standard is the strongest argument I can adduce in recommending you to support, by your influence, any measure that may be proposed for extending the operation of the law as it relates to this subject. The advantages which have arisen from the building of well-constructed lodginghouses for the labouring classes cannot be denied. I should rejoice to see them in Islington, but they fail to benefit the lowest class of poor, who can only be reached by a law which would limit the population permitted to the tenements they inhabit. 23. The removal of noxious accumulations of various kinds, under the superintendence of the Inspectors of Nuisances, is that which is constantly going on, and need only be mentioned as a portion of the work they have done. The extension of the sewerage of the parish, than which no sanitary proceeding is more important, will be reported to you by your surveyor. 24. I have merely to record the addition, in obedience to.your orders, of two additional ambulances for the conveyance of the sick poor to the hospital—one for fever patients and the other for persons suffering from non-infectious diseases. One thousand copies of my "Directions for Preventing the Spread of Infectious Diseases" have also been distributed. I should desire your permission for a re-issue, from time to time, as occasion for it may become apparent. 25. No alteration has at present been made in the condition of the vaults beneath the parish church. They have been visited by Mr. Grainger, by direction of the Home Secretary. He expressed himself satisfied as to the desirableness of some such amendment in their condition as that proposed in my last Report; but as yet no other result has followed his visit. Another Government Inspector, Mr. Holland, has visited, during the year, the desecrated burial ground in Church Street. Happily the disinterments, which have been the occasion of so much scandal and nuisance, have been put a stop to, under the provisions of a recent Act of Parliament. As I write, also, an Order in Council has appeared, directing the levelling and planting of the ground, and prohibiting any further disturbance of the surface It is to be hoped that this subject which, more than once, has been brought under the notice of the Home Secretary, with the sanction of the Sanitary Committee, may now be considered as disposed of. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. 26. Prior to the licensing day for slaughter houses, the inspectors visited all those respecting which notice was given to the Vestry of an intention to apply for a licence. Of these there were 100, viz.: 49 in the West Sub-district and 51 in the East. As was to be expected from the alterations and improvements effected in 1856, in drainage and paving, &c., there was little to amend in the condition of those which were licensed the previous year. The magistrates took a very liberal view of the objections submitted to them, and licensed all but five. COW HOUSES. 27. In the month of May I drew up for the Sanitary Committee by their direction, a "Report upon the general condition of the Cow-houses in the parish," some of 14 which had at various times been made the subject of complaint by the neighbours. 1 may briefly summarise it:— 1.° There were discovered 54 separate establishments—27 in the East and 27 in the West Sub-district—containing an aggregate of 924 cows, 541 in the East, and 383 in the West Sub-district. In the largest establishment 293 cows were kept, in the next largest 119, and the remainder ranged from 2 to 46. 2.° In only 11 were there 1,000 cubic feet of air allowed to each cow; in 28 the space was between 500 and 1,000; in 15 it was under 500; in 1 it was as little as 254 ! The ventilation of the sheds was mostly defective. 3.° Eighteen of the sheds were very dirty, in many others the paving and drainage were defective. 4.° The arrangements for storing and removing the dung varied. In 12 instances it was stored within the cow-house itself; in some others so near to it as to endanger the health of the cows. In few instances were the arrangements such as I could approve of, being such as were calculated to create very offensive effluvia, and produce an injurious effect upon the health of those residing in the vicinity. 5.° In few instances could I approve of the mode in which the grains were kept. In some I found either that no pains were taken to prevent their becoming offensive, by subjecting them to proper draining, or the sour liquid that exuded flowed unrestrained over the unpaved surface of the yard, or over the paving of the cow shed itself. 6.° My inquires led me to conclude, that although there was on the whole less disease among (he cows than in some previous years; yet, that the losses of the cowkeepers were by no means small. The principal disease that prevailed was "pleuro-pneumonia" or "lung disease," under which name I could not avoid thinking that the cowkeepers embraced indiscriminately various other maladies, probably of a typhous character. According to the statement of the largest keeper in the parish, only about half of the cows, newly arrived from the country, escape attack within the first 2 months of their confinement in the sheds. For the most part, the cows attacked are immediately sold for slaughtering. So far as the facts I ascertained went, the amount of disease was inversely to the capacity of the sheds, and higher where the air breathed by the cows was contaminated by the storing of the manure within the sheds.* 7.° There can be no question that in several instances cow-keeping is conducted in Islington, so negligently as, directly or indirectly, to create nuisances and to endanger health. The unhealthy manner in which cows are often kept is calculated to furnish a constant supply of "hazardous" or unwholesome meat to the shops.f 27. In the parish of Marylebone, regulations which were approved of by the Cowkeepers' Association, were enjoined by the Vestry, and agreed to and adopted by the cowkeepers of the parish, in a friendly conference with the local authorities, with the effect of obviating legal proceedings. If the Sanitary Committee were to take a similar step, I cannot but think that great benefit would result in Islington. TRADE NUISANCES. 29. In my last Annual Report I gave an account of the offensive trades carried on at Belle Isle, and the proceedings which had been taken for their control. Notwithstanding that the majority of those who carry them on have on their premises apparatus, by the aid of which the offensive effluvia given off during the processes might be intercepted or destroyed, numerous and grievious complaints continue to be made, and I can testify that these are not unfounded. Since the commencement of last year, * The particulars are given in my Report to the Committee. †The result of inquiries into this subject is embodied in an article entitled "Diseased Meat and Public Health,"—Brit, and For. Med.-Chur. Rev., Jan., 1858, page 87—to which I may refer you. 15 the only manufacturer of artificial manure remaining at the close of 1856, has, in accordance with an order of the magistrate, which followed the infliction of a doubled penalty, ceased to manufacture. The principal causes of nuisance, therefore, now are the varnish factories and fat melters. Several cases have been taken to the police court during the year, under my certificate, in accordance with the 27th section of the Nuisances Removal Act. In the last alone a conviction was not obtained. It was the fourth occasion on which the proprietor of a boiling-house for condemned meat had been summoned on account of the intolerable nuisance which his negligent mode of conducting his business gave rise to. A fat melter, in adjoining premises, was summoned at the same time, and, as each case had to be heard separately, the evidence failed to show which was producing the offensive smell for which both were summoned. Even where convictions have been obtained, the penalties inflicted at the police court have not sufficed to render the manufacturers careful not to incur them. In proof that varnish making, the manufacture of enamel black, &c., may be carried on without the production of the most insignificant amount of offensive effluvium, I may refer to the largest works of the kind in the parish, those of Messrs. Wilkinson and Heywood, in Caledonia-place. 30. I have been asked so often by different members of the vestry, whether I consider these offensive effluvia injurious to health, that I feel under some sort of obligation to express my opinion upon the subject, and I do not know that a better opportunity than the present is likely to occur. When I reply, that I do, it is necessary that I should explain myself more fully; and especially as I cannot but infer, from observations that have fallen from some, whose anxiety to ascertain the truth is most apparent, that they have a very obscure idea themselves of the meaning to be attached to the phrase they employ " injurious to health." Now it is not to be supposed that this term implies or need imply the direct production of fever, measles, hooping cough, erysipelas, or any other form of zymotic or acute disease in those who are exposed to these effluvia, in the diluted form in which they reach the neighbouring habitations. This is not even the ordinary or conventional meaning of the phrase, much less its scientific meaning. Nothing would be more absurd than to attribute to them the direct production of such results as these, or to look for proof of their deleterious influence to the prevalence in the neighbourhood of acute or zymotic maladies. To assert, however, that they are not "injurious to health," in the sense that they do not assist in effecting that deterioration of the powers of life, which every dweller in London, or in any large town, is cognizant of in his own person, that lowering of vital force, which drives a man, periodically, into the purer atmosphere of the country for a period of renovation, and, unhappily, leads many, who cannot compass this luxury, to the use of alcoholic stimulants to counteract their operation, would be to deny the evidence of one's own experience, and the plainest inferences of one's own reason. The atmosphere which enters our lungs, and whose more important elements are carried to every portion of our frame, cannot receive additions foreign to its natural composition, without the latter exerting some influence upon the frame. Unless then we are prepared to allow that this influence is a favourable one, (a view which I suppose no one would gravely maintain,) the only alternative must be accepted,—namely, that however tardy their operation, however imperceptible the encroachment upon the powers of the system, even though no more definite result ensues than that general curtailment of life, which is observed in a town compared with a country population; nevertheless, these foreign constituents are not innocuous. I cannot allow any exception to this rule in favour of offensive trades. I am perfectly aware of the objection to which this mode of reasoning is exposed. It may be demanded of me to prove that, amid all the exhalation from sewers, cesspools, and undrained land, the trade effluvia in question, rising into an atmosphere already fouled by the smoke from above 300,000 dwellings, have actually produced the results attributed to them, have acted to reduce vitality, and have shortened life in their neighbourhoods. Now, I at once, repudiate the justice of this claim. The operation of such effluvia I have asserted to be a chronic one, and, therefore, impossible thus to 16 demonstrate in a shifting population. Besides, it is not, it cannot be thus circumscribed. According to the direction of the wind and other conditions, that I need not particularise, every portion of the Metropolis in turn may be laid under the influence of noxious effluvia from any other part of it. Islington does not suffer alone from the foul vapours it may throw off into the atmosphere, nor can it fail to take its share in the harm arising from adjacent or even more distant districts. But even if all this were not manifestly true, I say that it is neither possible nor necessary to prove the individual deleterious operation of these effluvia. It is impossible, not only for reason already assigned, but because, in a metropolis like this, no one of the various sources of atmospheric impurity ever does, or ever can act singly upon the inhabitants, although, now and then, from peculiar circumstances, the action of some one may be intensified; and it is unnecessary, because all that is practically requisite to be assured of, is the truth of my major proposition, and that the offensive, or irritating vapours arising from such trades as are the subject of discussion, really do contaminate the air. If, as is sometimes the case, the healthiness of the men engaged in these trades, and therefore exposed to the effluvia in a concentrated form, be alleged in disparagement of these opinions, the burthen of the proof clearly lies with those who make the assertion. The aspect of the men who have followed these occupations for the longest time, certainly cannot be adduced in their favour: in this respect, they will bear no comparison with the workmen, for example, in an iron foundry. They may not suffer more from absolute disease, but I question if they would be as readily accepted at an insurance office, where the appearance of a candidate in relation to his age, forms an important element in a medical opinion. It would also have to be shown that, as a body, they were equally little addicted to indulgence in spirituous liquors. Setting aside also, the occasional instances where the disgust occasioned by the unpleasant odour, diffused through a neighbourhood, gives rise to nausea and vomiting even in persons not unaccustomed to it, an indirect disadvantage in a sanitary point of view arises from the closure of all the doors and windows of dwelling houses reached by the effluvia, which their offensive character renders compulsory. This is no frivolous complaint. If there were no other reason for placing these trades under control for the benefit of the public health, this might alone constitute a basis for authoritative interference. At the very season of the year when for comfort and health, the admission of fresh air is most eagerly desired, some of the most disgusting of the trades (as that of boiling putrid meat) are in the height of their activity, and the prevalent winds are just such as to waft the nauseating vapours through the Western and North-Western districts of Islington.
