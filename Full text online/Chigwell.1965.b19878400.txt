THE CHAIRMAN, MADAM AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1965, which includes the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. As from 1st April, 1965, the revision of boundaries resulting from London Government re-organisation reduced the area of the District from 8,972 to 8,769 acres, the number of inhabited houses from 18,138 to 16,535, and the population from 62,650 to 55,940. The area absorbed into Greater London consisted mainly of post-war L.C.C. houses (Hainault Estate), and as no shops, industries or old properties were included, the work of the Public Health Department has not been materially affected by these changes. VITAL STATISTICS As the births and deaths which occurred during the early part of the year refer to the population within the old boundaries of the District, the annual birth and death rates, which are necessarily based on the smaller mid-1965 population, are not exactly comparable with the rates for previous years. However, there appear to have been no significant changes. The birth-rate (14.2 per thousand) remains a good deal less than the national average (18.1), and the death-rate at 10.7 per thousand is slightly lower than the national figure of 11.5 for the year. Both these figures have been "corrected" to allow for differences in the age and sex distribution of the local population as compared with the national average as we have, in fact, a smaller proportion of women of child-bearing age, and of old people than the country as a whole. The rather high incidence of still-births (19) last year has not been repeated, and the number this year (11) represents a similar rate (15.1 per 1000 total births) to that for all England and Wales (15.7). Deaths of infants under one year (14 per thousand live births) remain well below the national average rate (19.0) which shows great credit to the standard of infant care in the District, The unchanged death-rate from all causes is the result of a balance between rises in strokes and coronaries, and falls in other forms of heart and circulatory disease, and cancers of the lung and stomach. There were no deaths from child-birth or abortion, /CONTROL -3- CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Control of infectious diseases has been highly satisfactory, apart from an outbreak of measles. Only 4 of these cases, however, required to be admitted to hospital. The single case of typhoid fever was infected in Tangier, and became ill on the way home. He was quickly isolated, and no contacts were affected. All persons arriving in the District from smallpox endemic areas without valid certificates of successful vaccination during the past 3 years were kept under surveillance in accordance with Ministry of Health instructions. SECTION! 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACTS, 1951 AND 1962 No formal action was considered necessary during the year. 9 persons in possible need of care and attention were investigated; 3 cases were voluntarily removed to appropriate accommodation either in hospitals or old people's hostels; the remainder were kept under observation at home. The meals-on-wheels service continued to assist where necessary and was much appreciated. THE ABBEYFIELD CHIGWELL SOCIETY Since the opening of the Abbeyfield Chigwell Society's housing scheme for the elderly in the District, the Medical Officer of Health has assessed in consultation with the general Practitioner concerned, the fitness for admission of those applicants referred to him by the Organising Secretary for an opinion, MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF The Medical Officer of Health examined 35 officers and staff of the Chigwell Urban District Council and 29 officers and staff of the Essex County Council on appointment for duties in the District; also 6 Chigwell Urban District Council and 7 Essex County Council staff were assessed and reported on for sick-pay and superannuation purposes, following prolonged periods of sick-leave or retirement. /RE-HOUSING -4- RE-HOUSING PRIORITY (M MEDICAL GROUNDS 89 requests for priority for re-housing on medical grounds were referred to me for assessment, usually supported by a doctor's written certificate. Each case was fully investigated and my recommendations were as follows Diseases or Conditions Total Applicants Priority Recommended Priority Not Recommended Asthma, bronchitis, catarrhal diseases etc. 16 10 6 Blood pressure 1 1 - Heart disease 11 9 2 Nervous disease (anxiety states, neurasthenia, neurosis etc.) 26 12 14 Rheumatism 3 3 - Tuberculosis 7 5 2 Other diseases 7 3 4 Other conditions 18 3 15 89 46 43 Figures for 1961 were 80 41 39 " " 1962 " 86 34 52 " " 1963 " 110 34 76 " " 1964 " 113 49 64 The 43 applicants not recommended for medical priority include (l) Illness not aggravated by housing conditions; (2) Temporary indispositions; (3) Those pleading the discomforts of overcrowding and structural defects (i.e. grounds other than medical) ; (4) Repeated requests already assessed. /In -5- In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Education Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

Hospital services are provided by the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board at the Forest Hospital, Buckhurst Hill, and at hospitals in neighbouring districts. /Health -12- HEALTH CENTRES: The County Council has three Health Centres serving the District, as follows:- BUCKHURST HILL: Essex County Council Clinic, Buckhurst Way. Tel: Buckhurst 5180. LOUGHTON: Essex County Health Services Clinic, Loughton Hall, Rectory Lane. Tel: Loughton 6295. Essex County Health Services Clinic, The Drive. Tel: Loughton 5776. At each of these centres there are clinic sessions for expectant mothers, infant welfare, school children etc., and details of these may be had on application to the centre. Each centre has two or more health visitors or school nurses who call upon mothers in their own homes in addition to giving advice at the centres. In addition to the above, infant welfare centres are also held at the following:- CHIGWELL: St. Winifred's Hall, Manor Road. The Manse, Chigwell Row. LOUGHTON: Roding Road Church Hall. SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE: The following extracts from the Annual Report of the School Medical Officer for the Forest Division are of interest:- "The formation of this Division took place on the 1st April. 1965 as a consequence of the Greater London Reorganisation and represents a merger of parts of two existing County Areas namely the Forest and Mid-Essex Divisions. It has a total population of 169,150 and a school population of 22,000. The Division includes Saffron Walden Borough and the following Districts:- Chigwell Urban, Epping Urban, Waltham Holy Cross Urban, Dunmow Rural, Epping and Ongar Rural and Saffron Walden Rural. /In -13- In view of the fact that the Area was formed on the 1st April the statistics in this report cover only the nine month period from thst date to the end of the year. They cannot therefore reasonably be subjected to any valid comparison with the previous figures. It is pleasing to report however that the general health of school children in the area remains very satisfactory. Gross physical defects are few and far between and in the vast majority of cases are under treatment before the child starts school. School medical examinations reveal an increasing number of children with visual defects and this group forms the largest single category. Although as has been pointed out there are no previous figures for valid comparison there is definitely an increase in importance of psychological factors and defects of the special senses in the field of school health, and these may play an important part in limiting a child's educational progress without necessarily being very obvious. Handicapped Pupils: The assessment of handicapped pupils in accordance with Section 34 of the Education Act 1944, to ensure that they receive special educational treatment best suited to their physical and mental condition remains one of the most important duties of the school medical officer. 76 childrert were newly ascertained as requiring this treatment in 1965, 243 pupils* in the Division were receiving special educational treatment at the end of the year. Approximately half of these were educationally sub normal pupils. Health Education: Special health problems now needing particular attention in schools are education about the relationship of the sexes, in all its human and social implications, including future responsibilities as parents, and the ill effects of smoking. On the other hand it is stressed that the content of a school's health education syllabus should be broadly based, aimed at giving the child knowledge which would equip him to face the social and health problems he will meet in later years. Child Guidance Service; Satellite Child Guidance Clinics are to be opened in Loughton and Saffron Walden and arrangements for the Loughton Clinic were well advanced at the end of the year. /School -14- School Dental Service: During the year 57 schools (5 secondary and 52 primary) were visited and all pupils dentally inspected. 53.9% were found to be in need of treatment. In addition the pupils at 2 residential special schools - Chigwell High View for E.S.N. boys and Nazeing Park for maladjusted children were inspected and received treatment. The Area Dental Officer comments favourably on the growing practice of parents bringing their children back to the clinic for dental inspection at more frequent intervals and it is to be hoped that this will continue since it is only by frequent inspection that decay can be recognised in its early stages and many more teeth can be saved," * Figures for the whole of the West Essex Division, HOME NURSES: BUCKHURST HILL: Mrs. J, Turner, 55 Walnut Way (Buckhurst 7689).

CHAIRMAN, LADY AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in submitting to you ny report for the year 1965. The year, although presenting difficulties due to Staff shortages and changes in personnel, was in general successful in maintaining a good standard in food hygiene by food vendors, rodent control, and general satisfaction by the 'customer' that complaints are promptly and satisfactorily investigated and dealt with. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year, and to the staff of the Department and other of the Council's Officers without whose support it would have been quite impracticable to have achieved a successful year's working, owing to recruitment difficulties and the fact that in spite of increased work in the Department, its staff is still below its nominal establishment. I would also pay tribute to Mr. Hamence and his staff for their kind assistance and ready co-operation in matters of food samples and complaints, to Dr. Robertson of St. Margaret's Hospital for his assistance with bacteriological examinations of specimens and swimming pool waters, and to Mr. Bywater for his valuable aid with Riding Establishments, and finally, last but not least, to Mr, Edwards for his assistance during the year and his contribution to this report in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5. R. ROPER, F.R.S.H.,M,A.P.H.I, Chief Public Health Inspector. June, 1966. -18- ANNUAL REPORT of the CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR 1965 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 1. WATER SUPPLY, The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board giving a piped service to 16,535 dwellings housing 55,940 residents, has been satisfactory in quantity and quality. It is not plumbo-solvent. Examination of samples taken throughout the year have confirmed the high standard maintained by the Board both chemically and bacteriologically. 2 . SWIMMING POOLS. The swimming pools in the District have been regularly visited and tests have been carried out to check the bacterial standards of the water. This has been found to be satisfactory and no complaints concerning the condition of these pools have been received. 3. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area within this District which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex River Authority. Some flooding of fields in the valley occurs during the exceptionally heavy winter rains. 4. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough Lane which was improved in 1938, extended after the war and is now being further improved with the addition of final effluent and storm water treatment lagoons and further percolating filters. A smaller part of the District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works where the Council has also decided to make improvements. The completion of these improvements at both Works is expected to result in a higher standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the River Roding. As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing foul flows from the new development and flooding but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers which contribute to the flooding difficulties referred to below. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still ocist. These combined sewers have caused flooding at various points in the District and work has started on the laying of new surface water sewers to remove part of the flow from the combined sewers in South Loughton and Buckhurst Hill and thus from the Sewage Treatment Works. -19- /A A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of the London Borough of Redbridge at Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme. Part of Chigwell Row drains to the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking. There are four outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. 5. PUBLIC CLEANSING. Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of seven compressing type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a service of removing bulky articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. This free service cannot be stressed too much as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses, etc. into ditches or onto forest land. Trade refuse also is collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse, the character of which is clearly not domestic. Refuse is at present disposed of by controlled tipping in Chigwell at a site leased to the Council. The refuse is covered with spoil, hardcore or other innocuous filling, and during tipping, only a very small surface of refuse remains uncovered. Measures are taken against flies, etc., as necessary from time to time, but this rarely happens. This tip will be filled during the next few years. Further and more long term arrangements for refuse disposal will have to be made at great cost to the ratepayers if the other local controlled tip sites are not made available, Salvage of paper continues to produce sales during the year. New trailers are to be purchased for attachment to the refuse vehicles so that salvage can be better pre-separated before tipping. Nearly 5,000 road gullies in County and District roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine regularly during the year by contract. 6. SANITARY INSPECTIONS OF THE AREA. The following statistics indicate the work of the Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Operator during the year.

RODENT CONTROL, WASPS AND INSECT INFESTATION. During the year 365 complaints regarding infestation by rats and mice were received. These complaints were investigated and treatment carried out where required calling for 2,190 visits for baiting and treatment. There are no major rodent infestations in the District. There were 429 enquiries regarding infestation by wasps and other insects 10. CARAVAN SITES;. Inspections have been carried out on the 7 licensed sites occupied by caravans, these have been found to be maintained in a satisfactory condition, no complaints regarding these sites were received during the year, and no formal action was found to be necessary. /11. -22- ' 11. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION, 135 observations have been made on industrial plants in the area under the Clean Air Act 1956 to control the emission of smoke from furnaces and incinerators, and 80 visits made to the premises in connection with the installation of plant or incinerator and to give advice to the operators. The District is generally free of any intensive smoke pollution from the industrial zone. Complaints are frequently made regarding garden bonfires, and in such case the offender is interviewed and advice offered to mitigate nuisances arising from the source, no formal action has been necessary in these cases. The use of volumetric apparatus in the Public Health Department to measure daily pollution of smoke and gaseous contamination has been continued throughout the year, the results are forwarded to the Warren Spring Laboratory of the Ministry of Technology at the end of each month. 12. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1964. The riding establishments in the area have been inspected and Mr. H.E. Bywater reports as follows "The year under review is of importance, in so far as riding schools are concerned, since on 1st April, 1965 the Riding Establishments Act of 1939 was replaced by the above Act of 1964. It is now illegal to conduct the husiness of a riding establishment unless, each year, the owner obtains a licence granted by the Local Authority. Whereas formerly, Local Authorities had the powers to have riding establishments inspected from time to time, some Local Authorities failed to exercise this perogative. Now the new enactment makes it obligatory for licensing authorities to have a report of a veterinary inspector when they consider applications for licences. Your Council have, for some years, exercised its right to have quarterly inspections of such premises and can thus claim to be amongst the more progressive Authorities in this respect. The general conditions which exist in these businesses especially with regard to the buildings- vary considerably and are related, in the main, to the financial resources of the owners. Whilst many of the stables are converted farm buildings and, owing to age, are far from ideal, it has been the practice not to penalise the owners on these grounds alone but to judge each application on the suitability of the animals for the required purposes and the general treatment given to them, rather than to attempt to be too drastic in enforcing too high a standard in the available /accommodation —23— accommodation, provided there is no evidence that this does not adversely affect the wellbeing of the animals. One has always to bear in mind that owners have the right aC appeal to a Magistrates' Court should the Council refuse to grant or renew a licence or to impose conditions to a licence to which the applicants may consider unreasonable. During the period covered by this report, the Pony Riding for the Disabled Trust, registered under the National Assistance Act, 1948 and the Charities Act, 1960, and which is under distinctive patronage, opened a school at the Grange Farm Sports Centre for the rehabilitation of physically disabled children and adults. Unlike the privately owned schools, which have been established on lands where buildings already existed, the Trust have had erected buildings specifically designed for the purposes required and this school is a model of what establishments of this kind should be. In addition to the stabling, there is a large covered riding school of conventional design, changing and resting rooms for the disabled and housing accommodation for the resident manager and groom. Care has been taken to make access to the various buildings easy for the pupils. The Trust is to be congratulated on its worthy objects and the manner in which it is striving to achieve them. The usual quarterly inspections of all the establishments, under your control, were made during the year ended 31st December, 1965. During the earlier part of this period, various changes occurred in the management of the Chigwell Riding School at Chase Lane, but now appears to be more efficiently conducted under the present licensees. Conditions, generally, in the various establishments were reasonably satisfactory at the various times of inspection and no contraventions of the Act were observed or complaints received from the general public in connection with them.
