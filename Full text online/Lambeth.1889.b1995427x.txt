By the original vote of the Ratepayers under the Library Acts the Library Rate was limited to ½d. in the £. A Requisition was sent, pursuant to the Statute, to the Overseers, calling upon them to take the opinion of the Ratepayers for power to extend the Rate to the full legal limit of a 1d. in the £. An anonymous Donor at the time offered that if this limit was annulled and power given to levy for the full legal maximum of 1d. in the he would, at his own expense, provide a site for a Central Library at Brixton, and erect the neccssary building. Another anonymous Donor also offered, on the same condition that he would make a donation of £500 towards the purchase of the necessary books for this Brixton Library. On the 10th October, 1889, a resolution was almost unanimously passed by the Vestry in favour of the restriction to ½d. in the £ being withdrawn. Voting Papers were accordingly sent out to the Ratepayers, and on the votes being counted on the 10th December, 1889, there appeared for the abolition of the limit of ½d., 11,251 votes, and against the alteration, 13,239 votes, giving a majority of 1,988 votes against the alteration. A very large number of Voting Papers were returned perfectly blank. The limit of the Rate to ½d. in the £ was therefore continued. 1 28 29 STATEMENT of RECEIPTS and EXPENDITURE by the Commissioners for Public Libraries for the Parish for the year ended the 25th day of March, 1890.

The Board of Trade directed Major Marinden to hold an Enquiry into the various Electric Lighting schemes which had been brought forward for the supply of electricity to the Metropolis. The Enquiry was opened on the 3rd April, 1889, and was attended by Representatives of the various Electric Lighting Companies, and of several of the Vestries and District Boards of London, some of them attending by Counsel The Clerk represented the Vestry. The Enquiry lasted eighteen days, and the Referee afterwards made his Report to the Board of Trade, and in the result two companies pressed to have provisional orders for Lambeth, viz., the London Electric Supply Corporation for the northern portion of the Parish, and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company for the whole Parish. The Vestry at first preferred the latter company, as providing for the whole Parish, but the Board of Trade considering that it was necessary that the London Company should be allowed to pass through the northern end of the Parish for purposes of communication between their works at the south-east of London and their main area of supply north of the river, and as the London Company were prepared to allow the main streets in the northern end of the Parish to be included in the compulsory area of supply, the Vestry assented to their order, and the same was afterwards passed by Parliament. The area comprised in the order was the whole of the Parish north of the Westminster Bridge Road, and the compulsory area consisted of the following streets, viz., Waterloo Road, Westminster Bridge Road, York Road, Stamford Street, New Cut, and Lower Marsh. As the Metropolitan Company refused to include within the compulsory area of their order a satisfactory list of streets, the Vestry objected to their order, and in the result the company abandoned it. 31 For the Parliamentary Session of 1890, four companies applied for orders, viz., (1) The London Electric Supply Corporation Limited, for a part of the Parish to the south of the area comprised in their 1889 order; (2) The Metropolitan Electric Supply Company Limited, for the whole Parish; (3) The House to House Kleclric Light Supply Company, for the whole Parish; and (4) The Electric Construction and Maintenance Company Limited, for a very small part of the southern end of the Parish. The applications of the first two companies were not supported by the Vestry, as to the first, because the company declined to give any further compulsory area, and as to the second, because the company refused to give any satisfactory compulsory area; but the applications 3 and 4 were supported by the Vestry, both offering a satisfactory compulsory area, the area of supply for No. 3 being confined to the portion of the Parish not covered by the London Companies' 1889 order, and not comprised in the area of supply to be comprised in the Application No. 4. 32 Compulsory Area of the House to House Electric Light Supply Company.

A Contract for the purchase of Vauxhall Park was made by the Vestry with Mr. Cobeldick on the 8th May, 1889, at the sum of £43'500 and on the day fixed by the Contract, viz.: the 31st May, 1889, the purchase was completed, and the property 33 conveyed to the Vestry. The purchase-money was made up as follows: — 1. The Vestry's own Contribution £11,746 17 6 2. Contribution to be made by the Charity Commissioners, but in the meantime provided by the Vestry 12,500 0 0 3. Contribution by the London County Council 11,746 17 6 4. Provided by other donations 7,506 5 0 £43,500 0 0 The amounts No. 1 and 2 were borrowed by the Vestry from the London County Council, in accordance with a power given under the Vauxhall Park Act. An arrangement was made by the Vestry with the Kyrle Society for the proper fencing and laying out the grounds at the expense of the Society, and this work was approaching completion at the end of the Vestry's year. BROCKWELL PARK. An offer having been made to sell, for the purposes of a Public Park, about 78 acres of land, known as Brockwell Park, adjoining Herne Hill Station, at the sum of £ 122,000, the Vestry were applied to by a very influential Deputation, headed by Mr. Bristowe, M P., to make a contribution towards the purchasemoney, and on the 18th July, 1889, the Vestry passed a Resolution assenting to contribute £20,000; some other Vestries also agreed to make contributions and the London County Council resolved to contribute £61,000. A Bill was introduced during the Parliamentary Session of 1890, to carry out the purchase and sanction the contributions of the various local bodies, and at the close of the Vestry's year this Bill was passing through the House of Commons, and there was every belief that the purchase would be carried out, and the site secured as an open space for the free use (for ever) of the public. C 34 LIGHTING. The number of Lamps lighted and maintained at the expense of the Vestry on the 25th March, 1890, was 4,163, and the total cost for the year of lighting, cleaning and maintaining, including new columns and lanterns, removals and sundry expenses, amounted to £13,295 os. 1od.

The following is a comparative statement of the prices per lamp paid by the Vestry to the three Gas Companies which supply the Parish:— Gas Light and Coke Co.—On actual consumption, according to meter, at 2s. 2d. per 1000 feet (3940 hours per annum, and 472 feet per hour per lamp), per lamp per annum £2 0 3 Lighting, Extinguishing, Cleaning, Painting, Repairing 0 18 0 £2 18 3 South Metropolitan Gas Co.—At per lamp per annum (inclusive of lighting, cleaning, Ac.) £1 3 9 Discount 5 per cent, allowed if paid within one month from Quarter-day 0 3 2 £3 3 7 Crystal Palace District Gas Co.—At per lamp per annum (inclusive of lighting, cleaning, etc.) £3 10 4 Discount 5 per cent, allowed if paid within a month from Quarter-day 0 3 6 £3 6 10 The Gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company and by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company has been regularly tested 36 by the Medical Officer, and the following is a summary of the Lighting Committee's Reports to the Vestry: Gas Companies.

THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, being a Report for the year 1889 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. pursuance of the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 and 26 Vic., Chap. 102, Sec. 43, I beg to present to our Vestry, a Report for the year 1889, upon the vital statistics and sanitary condition of the parish of Lambeth. According to an estimate made in the month of December, the population consists of 285,784 persons. The calculation is based on the natural increase arising during the year from the excess in the number of births over that of the deaths, and is corrected having a regard to the number of occupied houses, and the average number of inhabitants therein contained. The figure of the nsus return are necessarilly the basis of all population estimates and calculations. But since the last official enumeration in 1881 many changes have taken place. The erection of new buildings a 2 and the demolition of old, the formtion of new streets and the establishment of populous districts, have so far altered the conditions existing when that return was made as to render it and all deductions from it, unless with considerable correction and modification unreliable for statistical purposes. The figures before you, therefore, should be regarded in the light only of an approach to the existing condition which must remain a subject of speculation until the next official enumeration is completed. The distribution of the population in the eight registration subdistricts has not been subject during the course of the current year to any unusual distributing influence. But a study of the returns discovers a steady growth. The several districts display a considerable divergence one from the other in regard to their capacity for increase exemplified in their birth and mortality rates. Kennington Second, a district characterised by a low rate augmented its population by the birth of one thousand and thirty children, an increase of 26^2 for every thousand persons living, whilst Lambeth Church 2nd, recording sixteen hundred births, shows an increase of 34.4 per 1,000. On the other hand Waterloo 2nd, in which district a lying-in hospital is situated, a disturbing influence which it is necessary to eliminate from the calculation, has a birth rate of 50.5 per 1,000, and Norwood a rate of 30.4. The death rate shows a decline of 1 per 1,000 on the preceding year. After collecting and adding to the death return, the number of parishioners who died in out-lying institutions, and separating from it the number of those who, although not being parishioners died in the hospitals of Lambeth, the death rate for the year 1889 is calculated at 17.5 per 1,000. In the districts, the rate of mortality is at its highest in Waterloo 1st being 19-5 per 1,000 living persons. It is at its lowest in Norwood, being 14.8. The district, characterised by The highest death rate, is also remarkable for the density of its population. Waterloo 1st boasts a population of 253.3 persons per acre. 3 Much of the acreage of this district is comprised in the wharfage upon the banks of the river and is uninhabited. If the uninhabited affection were excluded from the calculations, the degree of density could be represented by larger figures. Norwood, on the other hand, contains a population of only 212 persons per acre, its mortality rate standing at 14*8 is the lowest recorded among the districts. In examining the table of deaths from all causes, it will be observed that 1,259 deaths took place in children below the age of the year. The deaths occuring in this class comprise twenty-five per cent, of the whole number recorded, and in regard to infant mortality, it is to be noticed that fourteen per cent, of the children orn during the year, died before they had attained the age of one year. Twenty-five per cent, of the deaths is referable to persons ying at and over the age of sixty years. The remaining fifty per cent. includes the deaths of persons dying between the ages of ne and sixty. To Consumption during the year is attributable the deaths of 67 persons, 384 of which died between the ages of twenty and sixty years. 107 of the deaths from this disease are recorded as accuring in the Brixton district. It is worthy of note that 247 persons died after they had passed their eightieth year, and in 107 of these death is attributable to d age alone. 37 deaths are registered as directly resulting from effects of excessive alcoholic indulgence, and of the 114 deaths referred to liver disease, doubtless a large percentage is due to this cause. No estimate however can be framed of the full effect of coholic abuse upon the death rate ; the disease the proximate cause of death, is recorded on the certificate, but not the agency by which the disease is produced. The principal contagious and infectious diseases, including Diarrhœa are responsible during the year for the death of 719 persons, exceeding the return of the previous year by 79 cases, the A 2 4 excess is due to a larger return under the headings of Measles, Diarrhœa and Diphtheria. The deaths in the last named division having increased from 103 to 155. But Typhoid Fever, Scarlet Fever, and Whooping Cough record a decline. On the 31st day of October, the Notification of Infectious Diseases Act, came into operation. By this measure, the notification of certain scheduled infectious diseases occuring within the several districts comprised in the Metropolitan area is made compulsory. Neglect in giving information is punishable by a penalty. The medical man in attendance, and the householder or relative in charge are the persons liable. The systematic notification of infectious disease, whilst largely augmenting the usefulness of the Sanitary department, has in no small measure added to its labour. A rule of the department, defining the duty of the Sanitary Inspector when called upon to inspect any place in which a case of infectious disease has occurred, runs as follows:—" When the Inspector is called upon to make an inspection of any part of a house, he shall make an enquiry into the sanitary condition of the whole of the premises, and if in such house any case of contagious or infectious disease exist, or has recently occurred, the drains shall also be tested." A large number of cases, it may be observed, now find a place upon the Inspectors Report Books, which except through the instrumentality of the Notification Act, would have run their course without notice. The expenditure of time resulting from that which may be regarded as wholly additional work is difficult to estimate. That it is considerable may be gathered from a consideration of the detail of inspection, isolation and disinfection carried out in accordance with the rules of the Department in each individual case. But this routine in many cases is only the prelude to the commencement of further operations. In a section of the houses notified as infectious, comprising a large percentage of the whole number, Sanitary defects are found upon inspection. 5 farn showing the Number of Infected Houses, Certified under the Notification Act, from 31st October to 31st December, 1889, and the Sanitary defects discovered upon Inspection.

The prevalence of this disease in 6 London is becoming the subject of anxious consideration. Attention was called to it in last year's Annual Report. Since the earliest appearance of Diphtheria little more than thirty years ago, every annual return, with few exceptions, exhibits a larger number of cases than its predecessor. And the year of this Report does not furnish an exception to that which apparently has become an established rule. On the contrary, the percentage of increase is greater than on any previous occasion. Formerly Diphtheria showed a preference in its incidence for small villages or isolated country houses, especially when situated upon the banks of streams, in the shed of rivers, or in low-lying and marshy districts. The atmosphere of large towns was regarded as exercising a prejudicial influence upon the developement of the poison. Anything more than a feeble and occasional outbreak in the Metropolis was neither anticipated nor feared. But unfortunately experience now points to the possibility of its acclimatization, and in the Parish of I ambeth its distribution has not been affected by the altitude of the soil. By a reference to the map, which indicates the position of the affected houses, it may be observed that a local outbreak occurred in the neighbourhood of Lyham Road, Brixton Hill; the Board School there situated, bearing a conspicuous part in the dissemination of the contagion. As much care was exercised in the exclusion of children from attendance at school, when belonging to the family of an infected person ; the extreme measure of closing the school was not considered necessary. This decision was justified by subsequent events. No further cases among the children in attendance occurred after a notice of the existence of the outbreak was communicated to the Sanitary Office, and the necessary precautions had been acjvised and taken. The Notification of Infectious Disease Act, which came into operation on the 31st October, in the year of this Report, by securing an early intimation to the Authorities, leading to the prompt isolation of infectious persons will it may be anticipated have considerable effect in checking the extension of outbreaks such as the one to which reference is made. Although Diphtheria 7 may find its way into houses by other channels than in effluvia arising from a defect in the drain, there is little doubt that defective drainage does exert an influence in the dissemination of the Diptheria poison. An examination of the Sanitary condition of infected houses appears to point to such a conclusion. But it must be remembered in the consideration of cause and effect that an examination as carefully instituted in houses of the parish in which no cases of Diphtheria nor other infectious disease lud occurred, would in a considerable percentage record the existence of defects in drainage. The results of the examination however, when analysed, appear to point to the existence of a larger number of defects than it can fairly be presumed do exist in houses not belonging to this category. As Diphtheria sometimes attacks more than one member of a family, the number of cases reported is in excess of the number of houses. Thus, while 286 persons are said to have been the subjects of Diphtheria, 222 houses alone were included in the inspection. What does the result of this inspection demonstrate ? Only 95 houses out of 222 were free from Sanitary defect. One hundred and twenty-seven or fifty-seven per cent, were defective. In fifty-four houses the defects were grave in character, and the suspicion that the insanitary condition resulted from some faulty connection or breakage in the pipes beneath the surface, upon subsequently opening the ground was confirmed. Defects of a nature not so serious, were discovered in the remaining seventythree cases; these principally relating to connected sinks, wastewater pipes, and to broken or otherwise defective traps. Although much good may be expected to result from the operation of the Notification of Infectious Diseases Act in securing the isolation of persons suffering from certain dangerously infectious diseases, and the disinfection of their houses. The 8 schedule of diseases to which the Act relates is not sufficiently comprehensive, and fails to include several diseases which should receive a place in that category. Whooping Cough is a complaint of a highly contagious character, and is one of the most fatal oi the Zymotic diseases. During the year it caused the death of 137 persons. The mortality of the last twenty years has never been represented by a fewer number of cases than 89, and in 1878 it was characterised by the enormous total of 342. During the two decades, the fatality from Whooping Cough was greater by twenty-five per cent, than that produced from the combined effects of Small Pox, Typhus, Typhoid and Diphtheria. Although a childrens disease, people at all periods of life arc subject 10 its influence, and many complaints of the chest carelessly attributed 10 the effects of cold may be traced as deriving their origin from the poison of this unheeded Zymotic disease. However, the injury inflicted upon the population by the prevalence of Whooping Cough, is not represented in a tithe of it- extent by the death returns. An attack in children, even when the disease is not of a severe type, distorts the chest walls, contracts its cavity, and permanently impairs the elasticity of the lungs. People who suffer from the chest diseases that commonly result from an attack of Whooping Cough in early life, find themselves unequal to the strain of any prolonged muscular effort, subject to early fatigue and at a disadvantage as compared with their fellows in the pursuits and occupations of life. Measles, another child's complaint, a disease accompanied by a considerable mortality, and characterised by after effects, which although perhaps less formidable, arc sufficiently serious, docs not find a place in the Schedule. These diseases, it would appear, have been omitted because for the greater part the attacks are confined to the child population. But a consideration of the largeness of the death returns, and the injurious after effects of 9 these diseases mikei it desirable that some attempt should be mi 1« to piicc a limit to their extension. The fact that they are children's diseases is a strong argument in favour of action. A child suffering from a disease unrecognised by the Notification i\t t, is not precluded from attendance at School. Schools anil other places of child contact become in too miny instances the centres of infection. There is a provision in the Notification of Infectious Diseases Act, which em{>owcrs the Sanitary Authorities to place on the Schedule of returnable diseases with the consent of the Local Government Board, any disease, which in their opinion, should be included in that category. It is a matter for the consideration of the Vestry whether an application be made that Whooping Cough and Measles be included in the list of diseases, the Notification of which is made compulsory by the Act The improvement in the Sanitary condition of the houses of the parish has progressed during the year. 6854 cases of Sanitary work have been undertaken and completed ; 4192 of these arc structural in character, and relate to ne* and improved drainage, improved water supply, renewed paving, and the establishment of means for surface ventilation. These figures show a considerable increase as compared with those of 1888. In that year the total number of cases stood at 4891, and the structural work at 2969. The number of cases included in the latter category for the year is greater by 33 per cent. The growth, which has taken place in the demand for this class of Sanitary work is illustrated in the table showing the work of consecutive years since 1877, 'n l^c second column headed Sanitary work structural and permanent. 10 SANITARY WOBK Year.

The number of marriages celebrated in Lambeth show an increase upon last year of 12.
