6 CAM 61 1857—58. ST.GILES, CAMBERWELL, SURREY. REPORT OF THE VESTRY OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. 18 & 19, Vic., cap. 120. london: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, BY E. BILLING & SON, BERMONDSEY STREET 1858. SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF THE WORKS executed by the Vestry for Twelve months, ending 25th March, 1858. Gentlemen, The termination of the second year of your Local Management necessarily demands a general Account of your proceedings, and although but a resume of the numerous matters which during the past year have occupied your attention, such recapitulation will not, I feel, be considered superfluous or unnecessary for the information of the Parishioners at large. SEWERS, &c. The works executed in this department during the last twelve months have not been of so extensive a character as was exhibited in my last year's report, which may be accounted for by two circumstances; first, that the attention of the Yestry on its formation was early directed to the extinction of the many lines of offensive open Sewers surrounding the habitated 4 portions of the Parish, and which had gained for it such an unenviable notoriety, (now I believe happily removed) and which Sewers with but few exceptions have been so dealt with that not only have the nuisances therefrom been abolished, but they have in most instances been converted into the means of permanent drainage, for the property which previously they only served to render almost uninhabitable. The few remaining lines of objectionable open Sewers have also received your consideration, and will in a short time be similarly dealt with. The second and principal reason to be assigned is the still uncertain and deferred result of the Main Drainage question, the delay in finally deciding upon the most efficient method of draining the Metropolis (however desirable it may be to give further time to develope a perfect as well as an economical system for such a vast national work) affects most materially your operations in carrying out what, in my humble opinion, appears to be one of the most important duties cast upon you by the Legislature. This retarding influence is apparent in almost every instance when the Yestry is applied to for the purpose of providing new Sewerage, as it not only affects the proper direction of such new works, their sizes and inclinations, as well as other matters of detail, but it also materially determines the question of ultimate efficiency, and as a natural consequence the cost of such works ; therefore until this much vexed question is decided a clog will remain upon your proceedings in this department; the responsibility of which delay, however, it should be well understood does not rest with this Vestry. The inconvenience of thus allowing even your present 5 incomplete drainage to remain in statu quo, has been attempted to be obviated by the suggestion of the establishment of an outlet pumping station, (see my Report thereon, dated September 16th, 1857) an application for which was made by this Vestry to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and which proposition it is gratifying to state has been accepted by that Board, and measures are now being taken to carry out this important work,—important especially to this and the surrounding low lying parishes, inasmuch that it will have the effect of raising, as it were artificially, the natural level of the district, and also giving a large amount of relief to the present pent-up Sewage, as well as immunity from the frequent occurrence of floodings, prejudicial alike to the value of the house property erected upon it, and the health of the inhabitants residing therein. It might be considered premature and intrusive on my part (whilst anxiously looking forward to the large amount of relief which I anticipate from this pumping station) if I were at present to go further than to suggest the possibility of its extension as a means capable of producing still greater results. I refrain, therefore, from enlarging upon the subject at this time, pending the further consideration of the Main Drainage question, but of this I am assured, that Jailing the early settlement of that great controversy an extension of the system above referred to (at least on this side of the Thames) could be made to produce most important results, and to accomplish much that could be desired for our drainage, and it also might possibly admit the solution of the great problem of the " Main Drainage " to be further postponed, without producing 6 any serious effects either as to the drainage of the district or of the interests of the ratepayers. NEW SEWERS. The execution of the Sewerage Works in the Park Eoad, Old Kent Road, and its vicinity, proposed in my Report, of Sept. l6th, 1857, as also some minor works in other localities has been ordered by the Vestry, and only awaits the necessary funds to be carried into execution. In reference to these Works I beg to take this opportunity of observing that some misconception appears to have arisen through the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works in respect to their having been accorded in the qualified terms "temporary works," thus implying (unless the qualification is explained) that ultimately this outlay may have to be repeated in the event of the " Main Drainage " Works interfering with their course. I also feel bound to say that, although in my Report above referred to, I qualified my recommendation of these Works, (setting the question of the absence of the usual gradient and other details to which I therein alluded against the necessities of that particular locality,) I would not, even under these pressing circumstances, have permitted the Vestry to fall into the error of sanctioning the construction of Works so soon to be interfered with, and likely to be destroyed, had I not felt assured of its improbability, from the fact that the course of the proposed line of "Main Drainage" along the Old Kent Road, as suggested by the Metropolitan Board of Works, could in no way prejudicially affect this Work, but rather that the execution of 7 this latter Work would provide the means of eventually diverting a large portion of the Sewage (which for the present must have a sluggish outlet into the existing Park Eoad Sewer) by the construction of intercepting lines along the Commercial and adjacent Roads, and which in effect would cut up the proposed new line of Sewer in the Park Eoad into short lengths, and thus produce for it additional and nearer outlets towards the " Main Line," and which would ultimately relieve it from any inefficiency of working through the present want of fall. Another reason may be assigned in support of the efficiency of this line of Sewer (even under its present disadvantages) viz., the construction of the "Pumping Establishment" before spoken of, producing as it will a continual drawing off of the Sewage towards the outlet, and thus partially compensate by a constant flow for the deficiency of fall at present attainable in the proposed route. Nevertheless, I would here remark in justification of my former Reports on this matter, as well as the general plan for the entire Sewerage of the Parish prepared by me in 1856, that it would have been far preferable had the improved "Main Sewerage "Works" therein anticipated, been constructed so that no expedient should have had to be resorted to, such as has led to the necessity of this explanation. I hope I have succeeded in making this subject better understood, and for this purpose have also appended to this Report a plan to illustrate the present and probable future working of the proposed Sewers. During the past year to which this Report has reference, 8 the length of new Sewers executed (with Works incidental thereto) is as follows:— Feet. 5 0 Barrel 20 4 . 0 Ditto 398 Brck Sewers- 4.0x3.4 25 3.9x2.6 320 2 . 9 Barrel 198 1.6 Ditto 60 1021 Pipe Sewers 12" Pipe 3306 9" Ditto 346 3652 4673 fret. Mile. In the above is comprised a length of 3,763 feet of offensive open Sewer which has been wholly abolished. Having briefly adverted to the Works ordered by the Vestry in respect to a further diminution of the open Sewers within the Parish, I beg again to refer to the open Earl Hewer extending from near to the Camberwell Road, running parallel to the Albany Road, in close contiguity to the House property abutting on its Banks, both in this parish, and also in the Parish of Newington, and further continuing its course dividing the Parishes of Camberwell and Bermondsey, at the rear of the Old Kent Road. The necessity of ridding the District of this open Sewer has been frequently urged upon the Vestry by the inhabitants, and reported upon by me, and I venture to hope that the joint eflorts of the abovenamed Parishes in their application to the Metropolitan Board 9 of Works, "at once to arch over this Sewer," will be successful; the importance of which Work in a Sanitary point of view cannot be disputed, inasmuch, that its present offensive condition goes far to neutralise the beneficial effects of the Local Works already executed by this Vestry. FLUSHING AND CLEANSING LOCAL SEWERS DEAINS, GULLIES, &c. These Works have, as usual, been carried on by your staff of workmen employed for such purposes, and upon the present condition of which I am enabled to report satisfactoiily. The Park Road Sewer has been recently cleansed throughout, in anticipation of the proposed new works before referred to, also the deep Sewer along the Peckham Road to Camberwell Green, which has been cleansed along its whole length and the solid deposit therein removed by casting, that is, by raising the heavy matter to the surface and carting it away. This work was rendered expedient through an improvement recently executed by the Metropolitan Board of Works by lowering the invert of the deep Sewer in the High Road, next Camberwell Green, the effect of which will be, now that the solid deposit is removed, that no such accumulation can again occur, as there will be an uninterrupted flow of the Sewage along the whole of this line of Sewer extending from Bethwin's Bridge, at the Parish boundary in the Camberwell Road, to the junction with the Main Sewer, in Peckham High Street, at the end of Rye Lane, under the jurisdiction of the Central Board, consequently occasional flushing, which previously was not 10 possible, will be sufficient to keep it in proper condition. The raising of the heavy deposit was conducted with all possible precaution, and was promptly carted away to prevent annoyance to the inhabitants, and I believe without any complaints having been made by them during the progress of the work. The length of Sewers under the control of the Yestry, and to which the supervision of your officers is directed, is as follows:— HIGH LEVEL. LOW LEVEL. Open Sewers 9 Miles. Brick Sewers 2 Miles. Brick 12 „ Pipe 1 „ Pipe „ 25¼ „ 3 „ Total—High Level 25¼ Miles Low Level 3 „ 28¼ „ DEFECTIVE HIGH LEVEL SEWERS. In many parts of the Parish the ancient water courses, which had by piece-meal been arched over, have by the construction of danger lines of Sewer become superflous. I have adopted it as General rule in all such cases, where practicable, to abolish these stagnant Sewers, which in many instances are found to be the source of much hidden evil, and injury to the adjacent property. A Sewer of this description in the Peckham High Street, running in part of its course directly under the shops has been recently filled up and abolished, and . 15 the drainage communicating therewith diverted into the deep Sewer, thereby removing at once the double evil of the nuisance from the existence of the old Sewer, and the frequent and useless expense of repairs thereto. ROAD GULLIES. The repair, re-construction, and trapping of a number of Road Gullies have been found necessary, being from their original construction quite unsuited to be connected with Sewers and Drains conveying Sewage matter. Many of these Road Gullies have direct shoots into the Sewers without Sand Traps or Receivers. Consequently the Drains become stopped up by the Road Silt flowing into them. To remove which entails considerable expense; it therefore becomes a matter of economy in all such cases to provide proper receivers for the Road deposit, so that it may be speedily and cheaply removed. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The subjoined table will show the operations of the Vestry in regard to House Drainage. In all cases when application is made in respect to either new or old property, the drainage is communicated immediately with a Sewer, should a Sewer exist, or if not, into properly constructed cesspools, as a temporary drainage until Sewerage AVorks are constructed in the vicinity. The same course is also pursued 16 in respect to property inspected, and reported upon by your Medical Officer. It has also been found expedient in many instances to permit the owners of property to continue the use of the drains already existing on their premises, on their filling up the cesspools, and carrying out other remedial works which effect the necessary improvements, and remove the complaints of the occupants, whilst at the same time it releases the property from an outlay which, in many instances, it is scarcely able to bear. Pursuing this course, and thus carrying out the spirit of the Metropolitan Local Management Act, without exercising oppressive powers has been the means of effecting much sanitary good within the Parish, and has avoided complaints of harsh and overstrained authority from being charged either upon the Vestry or its officers; but two cases of appeal against the orders of the Vestry for Works considered necessary to be executed, have occurred during the last twelve months, and in both of these instances the works are now in progress by the owners. I beg to refer the Yestry to the appended table on this subject. 17 HIGHWAYS. PARISH ROADS. The repairs, cleansing, and carting away the refuse of the Public Roads within the Parish, in extent about 32 miles, has been carried out in the usual manner, as also the repairs of the footpaths, inclusive of those on the Trust Roads, which by the Metropolitan Local Management Act are now added to the charge of the Yestry. The advisability of laying down additional kirbing and paving referred to in my last year's Report, having been since then under the consideration of the Vestry, and it having determined that at present no additional sum shall be levied for such purposes, I need not here further remark upon the subject, except that the reference which I then made in respect to the increasing wear and tear on the Parish Roads, and the consequent additional cost of their repair, I am enabled, with the experience of the last twelve months, further to endorse. NEW ROADS. Numerous applications have been made to the Yestry from owners and residents on lines of Roads and Streets not 18 yet dedicated to the Public, calling for the powers of the Metropolitan Local Management Act to be put in force to compel their repair. Surveys and estimates have been made, and every consideration given to such applications, but most of these cases have failed to provide the estimated amount for the repair of the Roads so applied for, and through the Yestry not possessing the necessary powers to enforce compliance, many of these thoroughfares remain a detriment to the Parish, and a disgrace to the neighbourhood in which they are situate : and the reproach attendant on their present neglected condition is unjustly visited on the Local Body who ought to kave the control over them, but whose present powers in respect to such matters are limited. This defect in the operation of the Metropolitan Local Management Act has been sought to be remedied by suggestions forwarded from this Yestry to the Metropolitan Board of Works for insertion in the Amended Act, proposed to be applied for by that Board in the present Session of Parliament. The additional Road adopted by the Vestry during the past year is Cemetery Road, length 2,400 feet. ROAD WATERING. The length of the Parish Roads watered during the past season was 17¼ miles at a cost of about £1,220. 19 IMPROVEMENTS ON THE LINE OF HIGHWAYS. The improvements carried out by the Vestry during the past year have been as follows:— church street, and grove lane. The widening of the Public way of these thoroughfares, which was in progress when the Vestry Report of last year was published, has since been completed. plough hill, lordship lane. By an arrangement with the agent to the Lord of the Manor, a portion of the waste Land on the east side of this Road has been thrown into the Public way, which has effected a great improvement at this spot, where, from the previously acute angle in the turn of the Road, and the declivity being steep, frequent accidents resulted. CAMBEKWELL GREEN. The final arrangements for enclosing Camberwell Green having been completed, and a contract accepted for the 20 posed Works, this important improvement is now in progress. Advantage was taken during the past winter to raise the level of this ground by carting road slop on to it, and although objection was taken to this proceeding whilst it was in progress, it is hoped that the benefit arising therefrom as well as the economy with which it was carried out, will compensate for any temporary annoyance to which the adjacent residents were subjected whilst it was in progress. ST. GEORGE'S BRIDGE, CROSSING THE SURREY CANAL, NEAR TO ST. GEORGE'S CHURCH, WELLS STREET. The widening of this structure so as to adapt it to the increased traffic passing over it, has for some time been under the consideration of the Vestry, A plan has been decided upon by which this Bridge is proposed to be widened to the extent of 40 feet, and which plan has been submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works for their approval, as also to obtain a contribution from them towards the cost of the proposed works as a Metropolitan Improvement. BUILDING ERONTAGES. The Local Management Act having imposed upon the Metropolitan Board of "Works the adjudication upon all proposed extensions of Building Frontages, as also the laying out of New Boads and Streets, and that Board having by arrangement referred these matters to the several District Boards and "Vestries for their Suggestions thereon, such as 21 appertained to this Parish, have from time to time occupied the attention of your Committee, and received the sanction of the Vestry, by which every opportunity has been seized to preserve uniformity in, and to improve the general lines of thoroughfare within the Parish. LIGHTING. The Report of last year showed extensive additions to the number of Public Lamps formerly erected within this Parish. Frequent applications are still being made for a further extension of Lighting to which the Committee appointed by you for that purpose has given its best attention, and who, whilst endeavouring to comply with the necessities of the localities thus brought under its notice, has not been unmindful of the increase of rating consequent thereon, and it has in many instances, as shown by the subjoined table, endeavoured to meet the requirements of the several cases by a re-arrangement of the existing Lamps, and has thereby effected the required improvement without incurring additional annual expenditure. The following table will show the number of Lamps already erected within the Parish on the commencement of the powers of this Vestry, with the additions thereto, to the 25th March, 1858. 22 No. of Public Lamps erected No. to Dec. 31/ 1855 1023 No Additional Lamps from the Removals 90 above date, to Lady-day, 1857 154 Ditto 27 Ditto ditto 1858 19 Total No. of Lamps now erected 1196 Total No. of Removals 117 I need scarcely trouble the Vestry with the details of the many other matters which have occupied the attention of the several Committees, and also your officers during the past year, as they have in most cases from time to time formed portions of the Reports to the Yestry, and received its sanction. In conclusion, Grentlemen, I venture to hope that the same amount of confidence, kind consideration, and assistance in the performance of the many onerous and important duties devolving upon me, which it has been my privilege hitherto to enjoy, may be claimed from you for the future to enable me to continue satisfactorily the performance of those duties, and gradually to develope improvements and requirements for the benefit of the Parish at large, and to the credit of the Yestry, whose function it is to carry them into execution. J. C. REYNOLDS, SURVEYOR. June 23rd, 1858. 1857-58. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. / b 2 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Gentlemen, During the year 1857, there were registered in this Parish 1,259 deaths (Table 1). This number is greater by 70 than that recorded in the previous year; but as it includes the returns of 53 instead of 52 weeks, it is necessary, before a fair comparison can be instituted, that the average mortality for one week should be deducted from it. This average is 24, and its subtraction reduces the difference between the respective mortalities of the two years to 46. If allowance be further made for the effects of increase of population, and if moreover the fact that 39 more deaths occurred in the Lunatic Asylums this year than last be duly estimated, the above difference becomes yet further diminished; and we arrive at the satisfactory conclusion that there is essentially little or no numerical difference between the mortality tables of 1856 and 1857—that the last year therefore was for this parish at least as healthy as the previous one, which on a former occasion I showed to have been one of the most salubrious years we had experienced for a considerable period of time. The death rate per cent. was 1.93 or 2.02, (Table 6) according as one or other of two 26 estimates of the amount of population be adopted; and it is important to note that even the higher of these numbers indicates a smaller death rate, than is assigned by the Registrar General to any one of the five large sections into which he divides the Metropolis; and that Camberwell therefore maintains that relative healthiness, which I claimed for it in my last Report. The deaths (Table 1) were divided as nearly equally as possible between males and females, 629 having occurred among the former, 630 among the latter. They were distributed according to age as follows:—430 deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age; 46 in children between 5 and 10; and 20 in children between 10 and 15; 18 persons died from 15 to 20; 85 from 20 to 30; 101 from 30 to 40; 105 from 40 to 50; 112 from 50 to 60; 143 from 60 to 70; and 199 from 70 upwards, of whom one had attained the advanced age of 100. The proportions here indicated, approximate closely to those revealed in the returns of the previous year; deaths are still most numerous at the extremes of life—those of children under 5 forming more than one-third of the gross mortality, and those of old persons upwards of 70 nearly one-sixth. 107 deaths are placed under the head of "violence, privation, poison, and premature birth;" 24 under that of "fever;" 18 under that of "dysentery and acute diarrhoea (not of infants)"; 44 under that of "scarlet fever and cynanche maligna;" 4 under that of "small pox"; 16 under that of "erysipelas, pyoemia, and puerperal fever;" 120 under that of " diarrhœa, bronchitis, and pneumonia of infants under 3 years of age; "52 under that of" measles, hooping cough, 27 and croup;'' 99 under that of" hydrocephalus and convulsions of infancy;" 179 under that of "phthisis and other tubercular diseases;" and 596 under that of "other diseases chiefly chronic" In this list some differences from that issued for the year 1856 will be observed. Deaths from hydrocephalus, phthisis, and premature birth have increased, whilst those from erysipelas, and puerperal fever have considerably diminished. And again, if we refer to the zymotic class of diseases, (Table 4) we shall find that though the total number of deaths due to them was nearly equal in each of the last two years, the relative number of deaths due to the several diseases included in this class have varied. So that, while fever deaths have mounted from 19 to 24, while deaths from scarlatina have increased from 30 to 44, and those from diarrhoea from 20 to 50; the mortality due to small pox has sunk from 5 to 4, that due to hooping cough from 32 to 30, and that dependant on measles from 48 to 7. Wherefore, on the whole, the details of the returns confirm the view derived from the consideration of the gross, and demonstrate the persistence of a favourable state of health among the inhabitants of the parish generally. The number of deaths (Table 3) registered in the several quarters of the year varied; 353 occurred in the first, 298 in the second, 276 in the third, and 342 in the fourth. And hence, as in the previous year, and as indeed usually happens, the deaths were most numerous in the most inclement seasons, namely the first and the last. In Dulwicli 16 persons died; one leas than in 1856. In the sub-district of Camberwell, 296 deaths occurred; an increase of 24 on the returns of the preceding year. In St. George's 28 there were 314 deaths, or less by 2 than those recorded in the former returns. In Peckham were registered 434 deaths, an excess of 18. In the Workhouse (Table 2) exactly the same number of deaths, 73, occurred in 1857 as occurred in 1856 ; but in the Lunatic Asylums (Table 2) they mounted from 87 in the former year to 126 in the latter. Dulwich, therefore, presents still an absolutely small mortality as well as a comparatively low death rate ; while in each of the other districts the specific mortality remains comparatively high. Yet the mortality even of Dulwich is, I fear, higher than it should be, for half of its deaths occurred in children under 5, and 5 deaths were the result of diarrhoea. In the remaining 4 divisions of the parish the infantile mortality, and that due to zymotic diseases, were not in the aggregate different to what they were in the previous year. In Camberwell, 45 deaths were assigned to diseases of the latter class; in Peckham, 67; and in St. George's, 42. Scarlet fever has been most prevalent in Peckham; small pox in Camberwell; measles in St. George's ; and hooping cough in Peckham and St. George's. The health of the inmates of the Workhouse has been good, and the deaths within its walls have been for the most part due to other than zymotic causes. And the same, in spite of the increase in the number of deaths, holds good with regard to the Asylums. Yet, notwithstanding the comparative healthiness which has prevailed throughout the length and breadth of the parish, any skilled eye glancing over the mortality tables will observe, that a considerable number of the deaths might have been presented—that some were produced by causes which admit of removal, and that others occurred in the course of diseases, the fatality of which by proper precautions may be obviated. 29 The deaths under the head of p hthisis and allied disease are due to a peculiar unhealthy form of constitution, in which there is a tendency to the deposition in various organs of a substance, which rapidly breaks down and ulcerates, and thus destroys the healthy tissues of the body, and ultimately causes death. Many of those who are the subjects of this affection inherit the tendency to it from their parents, and not unfrequently from their parent's vices,—" the sins of the fathers are visited on the children." But many, especially among the poor, acquire it, not only as the penalty of a dissipated course of life, but by long continued inadequate diet, over-work, exposure to the weather, and unwholesome habitations. Phthisis is a disease which will probably always prevail; but it is one which may frequently be prevented, or delayed, or ameliorated, by guarding against those habits of life, and obviating those defects of constitution, on which its development in great measure depends. Scarlet fever, measles, and hooping cough, have always been present among us, and will possibly never vanish. They are diseases, too, of so uncertain a character that sometimes, even under the most favourable circumstances, they assume a malignant and rapidly fatal form. But many of the deaths which result from them are undoubtedly preventable, being caused less by the inherent intensity of the diseases, than by complications, such as dropsy and inflammation of the lungs, which arise during their progress, and which are commonly produced by all those adverse hygenic conditions, which again are present most abundantly in the dwellings of the poor. Similar observations may be made, in reference to the deaths collected under the head of diarrhoea, bronchitis, and pneumonia of children under three years of age, and to those assigned to hydrocephalus and 30 sions, and to many of those ascribed in the tables to premature birth. In respect of the 4 deaths from small pox, I do not hesitate to say that they ought never to have occurred. Small pox is wholly preventable ; and were vaccination universally adopted, as it ought to be, throughout the country, would become for this land a disease of the past. I need scarcely tell you that since the introduction of the vaccine virus, small pox, which was once the scourge and terror of mankind, has dwindled away, until attthe present time it constitutes a comparatively rare and mild disorder. But unfortunately many persons yet, with all the bigotry of ignorance, refuse to avail themselves of the boon which is offered them; and the disease consequently smoulders still amongst us, and occasionally bursts into a flame, from the ravages of which even the protected may not wholly escape. As I informed you on another occasion, the degree in which fever prevails in any locality may not unfairly be taken as a measure of the sanitary condition of that locality ; inasmuch as its constant presence is a tolerably sure indication that there is some local cause, such as over-crowding, bad drainage, want of ventilation, or accumulations of filth, which encourages its presence. The number of deaths due to fever was certainly somewhat larger last year than the year before; yet it is gratifying to be still able to report, that a smaller proportionate number of fever deaths have occurred in Camberwell, than in any of the 5 groups of districts into which London is divided (Table 5). Under the collective term of fever, are included at least two perfectly distinct diseases, which until recently were confounded together, and which even now are sometimes difficult to separate. One 31 of these is the true typhus, which, like small pox, scarlet fever, and allied diseases, is propagated by contagion, but spreads with remarkable virulence amongst the crowded inmates of unwholesome and closely-packed dwellings. The other, which passes under the denomination of typhoid fever, is little or not at all catching, and is developed almost solely as a direct consequence of bad drainage, filth, over-crowding, and other like conditions. It is far more common than the deaths referred to it might lead one to suppose; for it varies in intensity for a fever of the most malignant type to a slight diarrhoea, or a slight malaise ; on the one hand being likely to be confounded with typhus, and on the other, in the majority of instances, being regarded as a simple disorder of the bowels, or as a mild catarrh. But whether mild or severe it is attended by ulceration of the bowels, and is never free from the danger of producing a fatal result. The ravages of typhus may be arrested by improving the habits and dwellings of the poor; and typhoid may be altogether prevented by remedying those defects on which its development depends—defects, which happen to be precisely those to which the attention of your health officers are particularly directed. 1,065 boys, and 1,018 girls, in all 2,083 children were born during the same period as that for which the mortality has been reckoned. The births, therefore, exceeded the deaths by no less a figure than 824. The Sanitary labours of myself and your Inspectors of Nuisances, have been actively carried on during the year terminating March 31st, 1858, and with a result as satisfactory as that which attended our previous efforts. 2,594 houses, 32 chiefly of the poorer class, have been inspected, relating to which 596 first, and 82 second notices have been served. In accordance with the requirements of these notices, 228 cesspools have been emptied, and 336 filled up; 324 closets have been provided with pans and traps, and connected with the sewer; 635 drains have been trapped, cleansed, and otherwise improved; 74 yards have been paved; 171 houses have been cleansed and whitewashed, and 21 have undergone repair; in 98 instances water has been laid on to closets, and in 50 it has been supplied for drinking purposes; 41 dust-bins have been provided; and in addition 755 miscellaneous nuisances (those arising from pigs, accumulations of dung, vegetable refuse, ashes, &c.) have been remedied. Besides the above, the slaughter houses in the parish, 47 in number, were carefully examined last autumn. The majority were in good condition; but in 23 cases they were lime-whitened; in 10, paving was either newly laid down or amended; in 4, the premises were drained, and in 1 water was supplied. In 3 instances the premises were unfit for the purpose to which they were applied, and the licenses were successfully opposed before the Magistrates. I need scarcely comment on the importance of the above figures; they indicate that a large amount of improvement as regards the sanitary condition of dwelling houses has been effected throughout the parish, and this quietly, and with scarcely any necessity for ultimate appeal to the Magistrate, It must be recollected, too, in forming an estimate of the amount of work accomplished, that almost all the domiciliary visits indicated above, together with almost all the resulting benefits have been the fruit of seeking nuisances out, and that 33 the 755 cases of miscellaneous nuisances comprise nearly all those, in which the complaints have been initiated by the parties affected by them. In respect of several of the above classes of improvements which have been carried out, I should wish to make a few observations. The laying on to houses of water for drinking purposes has been accomplished in some cases, in which either no kind of supply had previously existed, or in which the pump water already in use, was found from its bad quality, to be unwholesome and unfit for drink. I may remind you, that for some months past, I have been in the habit of laying before you analysis of the waters supplied by the Kent, the Lambeth, and the Southwark companies, showing that, though the Kent company's water is scarcely so pure as that furnished by the other companies, they are all fair specimens of drinking water, and far superior to that generally furnished by shallow wells. Consequently, I believe it will be to the benefit of health, when the use of the companies' water has replaced that of the water derived from wells throughout the whole of the parish. The erection of dust-bins has been enforced in certain cases ; as for example in connection with houses of a superior class ; or where it was found possible to provide one for the use of several poorer dwellings. I must confess, however, that I should be glad to see dust-bins more generally erected than they are, for I am quite sure they would conduce to health, by preventing vegetable refuse, and other offensive matters, from lying about and rotting in the back-yards; and from being thrown out into the streets, as is often the case in the lower portions of the parish. 34 The cleansing, whitewashing, and repairing of houses, is an important item of our labours; not merely because these processes improve the appearance of houses, and give them an air of comfort; not merely because they remove the accumulated filth of years; but because they remove also, or neutralise those faint poisonous animal emanations, which, in the crowded dwellings of the poor, cling to the surface of the ill-ventilated rooms; and because, moreover, they tend to destroy those dangerous influences which infectious fevers engender, and which remain frequently for a considerable period, after the fevers, which have produced them, have themselves disappeared. But of all the improvements which have been accomplished, those dependent on the filling up of cesspools, and the carrying out of proper drainage works are the most important. Of all the abominations which disgrace and pollute the dwellings of the poor, the imperfect, rarely-emptied, and overflowing cesspools, are by far the worst. Placed generally in confined situations, frequently adjoining, and sometimes actually within the houses, their fluid contents soak into the surrounding soil, contaminating the water of springs; saturate the adjacent walls, diffusing through them a foetid moisture which rises sometimes to the ceiling ; and even overflow their margins, producing stagnant putrid pools beneath the very floors. And thus they pollute not merely the soil, but the water which that soil furnishes for drink; thus they not merely poison the atmosphere without, but pour their emanations constantly, silently, deadly, into the interior of the houses themselves. I am not here drawing from imagination ; not a fact, not a line is caricatured ; every horror which I have indicated has its original even now within this 35 parish. I invite you to Regent Street, to the Melon Ground, to New Peckham; aye, and to localities more wealthy and respectable than these, where, unfortunately, no means of drainage exist, in confirmation of the truth of my statement. I need scarcely say, however, that the last two years' labours have not been barren of result, and that in many places the nuisances alluded to have been more or less effectually remedied. In Wyndham Road, Nelson Street, Thomas Street, in Stockwell Street, Peckham Orchard, in the network of streets between Camberwell High Road and Southampton Street, and in numerous other localities, a vast number of cesspools are now replaced by tolerably efficient closets; and I assure you that the amelioration is striking. The inhabitants universally appreciate the change, and mostly express approbation and gratitude. And I may add that not only have landlords generally been willing to carry out the necessary alterations, but that not unfrequently they have been glad to avail themselves of the relief offered by ditches recently covered. The ill-effects of cesspools are not imaginary. They do not offend the nostrils merely, but they affect the health. They contain, not like a well-made sewer, a running stream of a comparatively inoffensive mixture of sewage and water; but their contents like the material, deposited on the sides of a foul open ditch, and on the mud banks of the Thames itself, form a stagnant mass of decomposing ordure, which is the common parent of diarrhoea, of fever, and of cholera, and often exerts a fatal influence over the course of other diseases. I refer to the appendix for a striking example of the dangerous effects of these abominations, in respect of which I have spoken thus fully, in order to urge 30 your honourable Board to carry out, whenever it is practicable, those drainage works which you have in anticipation; and to press you to persist in that good work, in which during the last two years you have been so earnestly and successfully engaged,—the persistance in which cannot do otherwise than eventuate in the permanent benefit of the parish. It may have been anticipated, that the present Report would be made the vehicle for some remarks on that subject in which we, in common with all London, are so deeply interested namely, the great drainage question. It has appeared to me, however, after mature consideration, that there could be little or 110 advantage, in obtruding upon you any observations of my own, in reference to the various schemes which are now before the public,—that on the contrary, it would be merely contributing my mite, towards throwing difficulties in the way of a subject already complex and difficult enough. It is necessary that this parish, and others similarly situated, should be efficiently drained; it is necessary that the river should be dispolluted, or at all events, that the present nasty and unwholesome results of its pollution should be remedied; and to accomplish those ends I sincerely trust that some scheme, approved by competent authorities, and satisfactory to the ratepayers, may be speedily determined on, and when determined on, carried into execution without unnecessary delay. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. S. BRISTOWE, M.D. June 16th, 1858. 37 Extract from Medical Officer's Fortnightly Report, read April 21st, 1858. On the 25th of February last, I received from one of the Physicians to the London Fever Hospital a letter, informing me that between June and September of last year, no fewer than six policemen labouring under Typhoid Fever had been received into that institution from the Peckham Police Station; and, at the same time, enquiring if it were possible to discover what could be the cause of the remarkable unhealthiness of the men liviug in that place. In consequence of this communication, I paid several visits to the station, and ascertained not only that fever had been prevalent, but that severe diarrhoea was a common complaint among those coming to reside there for the first time, and that cholera had appeared there during both of the late visitations. I ascertained also, that decidedly offensive smells were frequently perceived in a room on the ground floor, in which the policemen usually sit when off duty, and take their meals ; and that these smells had been in existence, off and on, for years. I found at the same time that there was a properly constructed water closet within the house, contiguous to the room alluded to. I was told that the drainage of the premises was perfect, that every water closet communicated with the sewer, that every drain was trapped; moreover, that all these matters had been thoroughly investigated, and all necessary improvements D 38 effected last autumn; and that the flooring even of the room in question had been removed, in order to discover whether any thing offensive could be situated beneath it. Having met by appointment the Surveyor to the Police Force, I was informed however, that the water closet of which I have spoken had been assumed (apparently on good grounds, for it was not offensive, had been in use for years, and had never" been obstructed) to communicate with the Sewer, but that the communication had never been traced. Guided by the well authenticated existence of offensive smells, and by the nature of the diseases which had prevailed, I strongly urged the importance of ascertaining positively whether some neglected cesspool or something of the sort might not after all really exist in connection with the closet, and the Surveyor readily agreed to order the necessary examination to be made. This was carried into execution about a fortnight ago; and it was found that the closet was not connected with the Sewer at all, but that its discharge pipe emptied itself into a cesspool between four and five feet wide, which had apparently been an old neglected well; and that the mouth of this well, covered only by a couple of stones, was under the the house, and within a few feet of the room to which I have alluded. Ten feet in depth of extremely foetid soil were taken away ; but to what depth the accumulation actually extended was not ascertained, for below this it had become so hard with age, and so difficult of removal that it was thought best to leave it, and cover it with lime. I need scarcely add that the cesspool has now been effectually abolished, that the necessary drainage works have been completed, and that so far as present experience goes all noxious smells have ceased. The importance of this case, not only as it affects the 39 persons dwelling on the spot, but as it relates to the causes and mode of prevention of cholera and fever, is so great, that I have felt it my duty to lay it fully before you. Here was a colony of men in the prime of life, naturally healthy, and robust, living in a handsome, airy, properly-ventilated, dry, and apparently well-drained house, and yet they were constantly subject to fever, and among the first to suffer from the poison of cholera. Cholera, as is now generally recognised, is always most severe and fatal where the drainage is bad or imperfect, and where emanations from cesspools or sewers abound and accumulate. The form of fever, too, under which these men laboured is not an infectious form, but is regarded by almost all practioners as a pro'duct of the same causes that favour the spread of cholera itself. It is the form of fever which, in consequence of defects in drainage, raged some years ago with such violence in Croydon. With the above facts before them I believe few would venture to dispute that the unhealtliiness (which was notorious) of the Peckham Police Station was due to the foetid cesspool which has now been abolished, and that had this been abolished years ago a great amount of ill health would have been prevented, and some lives spared. I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient servant, J. S. BRISTOWE. d 2 40 TABLE V. Table shewing Mortality due to Fever, (increase of Population not allowed for.) Population in 1831.
