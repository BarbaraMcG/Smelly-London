The Board, in June, 1881, re-appointed Mr. R. H. Davies as Public Analyst for this District, and an account of the various articles submitted for analysis with the result of the examination, will be found annexed (see Appendix No. 5). As an instance of the difficulties that are found in the endeavour to carry into effect the provisions of these most salutary Acts of Parliament, the Board desires to draw attention to the facts connected with the two following cases, which occured during the year. Upon the hearing of the summons issued against Mr. H. Aldridge, of 59, Masboro Road North, Hammersmith, for having sold milk adulterated with water, (the Public Analyst's certificate reporting the sample to be adulterated with 14 per cent. of added water). The defendant contended that the milk was pure and required that a further analysis should be made, as provided by the statute ; the second official part of the milk was accordingly submitted to the Analysts at Somerset House. Upon the adjourned hearing the report from Somerset House was produced, and it stated that the amount of solids "not fat" is low when compared with that found in genuine milk, and that the sample contained not less than 4 per cent. of added water. The defendant produced in court a certificate signed by Dr. Redwood, whom he had employed to analyse the (third) portion of the milk that had been left with the vendor according to the statute, and this certificate reported the sample as "poor milk." Dr. Redwood was called in support and admitted, in answer to my question, genuine milk should yield upon analysis at least 9'0 of "solids other than fat," and that the sample under consideration did not come up to that standard. A comparison of the figures given in the three several certificates shows thus:— Mr. Davies, Pub. Analyst, Fulham District. Somerset House. Mr. J. Bell. Mr. Bannister. Mr. G. Lewin. Dr. Redwood. Total Solids 10.60 10.61 11.30. Fat 2.86 2.77 2.70. Solids other than Fat 7.74 7.84 8.6o. 22 It must at once be apparent that the certificate of the three professors of chemistry at Somerset House confirms the results given by the public analyst, Mr. Davies, the difference being 0.1 only, or in other words, one hundredth of one per cent. Mr. Davies' certificate goes on to say the sample is adulterated with "14 per cent. of added water." The three professors of chemistry at Somerset House say "not less than 4 per cent. of added water!' Dr. Redwood says it is "poor milk." The difference in the per centage of "added water," between Mr. Davies and the three professors at Somerset House is accounted for by the fact of the authorities there adopting a low standard for pure milk and consequently allowing a larger per centage for the natural water found in all milk. My contention before the Court was that I had, upon the facts, clearly proved my case, the certificate from Somerset House, corroborating the Public Analyst's Certificate. Four experts declare the milk to be adulterated to one on the other side who called it "poor milk," and that Dr. Redwood's certificate itself showed that the sample did not come up to his own standard for pure milk and that I was entitled to a conviction. The learned magistrate after consideration stated that he found he was not bound by the certificate from Somerset House, and dismissed the summons with six guineas costs. Upon the hearing of the summons issued against James Bail, of 96, Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush, for having sold Milk adulterated with water (the Public Analyst's certificate reporting the milk to be adulterated with 14 percent. of added water). The Defendant contended that the milk was pure, and required that a further Analysis should be made, as provided by the Statute. It was then agreed that the two remaining portions of the samples should be submitted to the Analysts at Somerset House. Upon the adjourned hearing, the report from Somerset House was produced, and it stated that the amount of solids, "not fat," was lower than is found in genine milk, and that the sample contained not less than 5 per cent. of added water. The Magistrate decided that he must convict, but expressed his views that he could not place any reliance upon the certificate of the Local Analyst. Thereupon the Public Analyst was requested to give a report upon the case, which he did as follows:— "I feel it incumbent upon me to offer some remarks upon the prosecution, for milk adulteration, heard before the Hammersmith magistrate on Friday last, and his observations on that case. 23 "Upon several occasions milks analysed by me have been referred to Somerset House, and on every one of these the Analyses of the Somerset House Chemists has agreed well with mine. Thus, in the present instance, the figures obtained were— R.H. Davies. Somerset House Sample 1. Authorities. Sample 2. Total solid constituents present 10.36 9.92 10.00 Fat 2.52 2.42 2.56 Solids other than fat 7.84 7.50 7.44 "Sample I was that left with the Vendor; and sample 2 that left at the Office of the Board of Works, (both being taken from the same bulk). "It will be seen that the Somerset House Chemists obtain lower results than mine. This is accounted for by the fact that the milk had become sour and decomposed when examined by them. This decomposition takes place in the 'Solids other than Fat,' and always lowers their quantity somewhat. "Upon my results, I stated that the sample contained, in my opinion, 14 per cent. of added water. The Somerset House Authorities, though their Analysis indicates a rather poorer milk than mine does, state that "the milk in each sample contains not less than 5 per cent. of added water." "I will endeavour to explain this disagreement in the conclusions drawn from analytical results so closely resembling each other. "The limits of variation of milk from the properly fed, healthy cows are very slight, and are well known. It is found that in the great majority of cases such milk yields at least 93 per cent. of 'Solids other than Fat.' This is the most constant factor in milk analysis. Sometimes a higher, and occasionally, a slightly lower result is obtained ; but 9 3 is the average amount in many thousands of samples of milk derived from healthy cows, and consequently a sample yielding 9.3 per cent. of ' Solids not fat,' may be regarded as milk of average quality. "By ill healh, low feeding, and other causes, milk of a quality much poorer than this has sometimes been yielded by cows. "In the opinion of the Somerset House Authorities, a sample of milk has been known which, judged by the standard of average milk, was about one-tenth poorer, and would therefore, represent 10 per cent. of added water. "It is admitted that such a poor sample is abnormal, and 24 probably will not occur once in a hundred samples of milk ; also that the average of that hundred samples would yield 9.3 per cent. of solids not fat, "In case then a sample of milk is so low as to be worse than even this limit of very poor milk, and must therefore be declared adulterated with water, the question arises—Are we to assume that the milk before adulteration was milk of average quality ; or must we assume that it was the very poorest milk ? "Remember, it is impossible to tell by analysis what kind of milk was used. It is therefore a matter of probability only. Surely, the only commonsense assumption is that the milk used was of average quality, since probably 99 samples of this occur for one sample of very poor milk. " The Somerset House Authorities state the per centage of water which must have been added if this poorest possible milk had been used. Thus, in this case they say, ' Not less than 5 per cent. of added water' is present, that is to say, 5 parts added water, and 95 parts excessively poor milk (abnormally poor) would produce a sample equal to this. "This mode of stating the case is in perfect accord with the statement I make, since the poorest milk differs by about 10 per cent. from average milk, which I have assumed was used. Therefore such a mixture as above would about equal 15 parts added water, and 85 parts milk of average quality. "The Somerset House Authorities are, in my judgment, wrong in taking so low a standard of pure milk. In this opinion I am supported by the practice of the Public Analysts throughout the country, and especially by the Society of Public Analysts, which has indicated, after some thousands of analyses, performed by Members of the Society, that 9.3 per cent. of solids not fat, may be taken as the standard for pure milk, and that any sample yielding less than 9 per cent. of solids not fat, must be regarded as adulterated. "The Adulteration Act expressly states than an article is to be considered adulterated if it is not of the nature, substance and quality demanded; and I maintain that an abnormally poor milk containing only nine-tenths the nourishing power it should contain, does not fulfil this requirement, and is, therefore, adulterated. "The effect of the referees taking so low a standard is that the milk sellers throughout the country will be able to adulterate their milk to the extent of 10 per cent. without fear of consequences. 25 "In London alone, if this were done, £150,000 per year would be paid for water thus fraudulently added to milk. "(Signed) "R. H. DAVIES, F.I.C., F.C.S., "P.A. for the Fulham District, Chemist to Apothecaries Hall, &c." Crown Road. The Board took steps under the Highways' Act for the diversion of Crown Road, near the Halfway House, and for widening the road at that spot. The work is now completed, and a great improvement has been effected. Parliamentary Notices. In accordance with the standing orders of Parliament, plans, sections, books of reference and copy of Gazette notice were deposited at the office of the Board on the 30th day of November last, for the following Schemes:— 1.—Metropolitan District Railway (Hammersmith Junction). This Bill is for effecting a Junction between the existing District Railway at Hammersmith, and the Hammersmith and City Railway. The Board resolved to petition against the Bill in order to obtain protective clauses. The Bill was ultimately withdrawn. 2.—London and North Western Railway (Willesden Curve). This Bill, which proposes to form a junction by a double curve, commencing at the South Western end of the bridge which carries the Kensington and Broad Street Line over the London and North Western Railway, and to join the North and South Western Junction about 4 chains west of Old Oak Junction Bridge. No public property being interfered with, the Board resolved to take no action therein. 3.—Metropolitan Railway (additional lands). This Bill was for the purpose of giving power to the Metropolitan Railway Company to purchase the strip of land next the Sussex Arms in the Broadway, and other lands. No public property being interfered with, the Board decided to take no action therein. 4.—Mid Metropolitan Railway (Pneumatic System): This Bill proposed to form a tunnel railway, on the pneumatic system, from the northern end of Holland Road to Aldgate. As it was not intended to alter the level of Holland Road, the Board decided to take no action therein. 5.—Latymer Road and Acton Railway. This Bill is for the purpose of forming a railway, commencing at a junction with 26 present Hammersmith and City Line over Wood Lane, and terminating at a junction with the Great Western Railway at Acton. The Board decided to petition against the Bill to obtain protective clauses. The Board's clauses having been inserted in the Bill, it was decided to withdraw the petition against and present a petition in favour. The Bill subsequently passed into a Law. 6.—London and South Western and District Railway (Kingston and London Railway). This Bill does not in any way affect any public property, it being simply a deviation of the authorised line of Bridge over the Thames, the Board therefore took no action therein. 7.—West Metropolitan Tramways' Bill. This Bill being for the construction of a tramway from Gold Hawk Road to Beadon Road, and a relief line through Studland Street, Glenthorne Road and Beadon Road, and to Kew and Richmond, the Board decided to enter into negotiations with the promoters for the insertion in the Bill of protective clauses, and for certain modifications. The clauses having been inserted in the Bill, the Board gave its consent to the construction of the tramway, but the Bill has not yet passed the House of Lords. 8.—Westminster, Pimlico and Chelsea Tramways. This scheme was subsequently abandoned. New Streets. Under the provisions of the 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, 25 & 26 Vic., cap. 102, the Board has during the year taken to the following new streets :— Porten Road. Milson Road, 1. Dorville Road. Sinclair Road. Sinclair Gardens. Cathnor Road North. Masbro' Road North. Percy Road, 1. Percy Road, 2. Davisville Road. Westville Road. Macfarlane Road. Milson Road, 2. Chesson Road. Anselm Road. Estcourt Road, 3. Cumberland Crescent. Hammersmith Terrace. Land having been given up for the purpose of widening the Highway at Hammersmith Terrace, the Board, in consideration for the land given up by the owner on the north side of the Highway, kerbed and paved the path, and an improvement has been effected at this spot. 27 Survey of District. The Board has had under consideration for some considerable time the necessity of having a complete and correct map of the district, shewing all the alterations that have taken place since the formation of the Board in the year 1856. The matter is before the Works Committee to enquire and report as to the best mode of carrying it out, and Committee will shortly report thereon. Metropolitan Representative. The Board in the month of June, 1881, elected Mr. George Brown as the representative of this district at the Metropolitan Board of Works. Union Court. An action was brought by Mr. Mead, a lessee of certain houses in Union Court, to restrain the Board from using this Court as a roadway. The Board defended the action up to a certain point, and on 3rd June, 1881, under the advice of Counsel, consented to an order being made, (the terms of which were agreed with the plaintiff) by which the Board were not to use the Court as a roadway, unless the consent of the Metropolitan Board should thereafter be obtained. This consent up to the present time the Metropolitan Board has declined to give. Public Mortuary. \ The Board is of opinion that the time has arrived when the development of the district and rapid increase of the population demands that some efficient provision should be made for the reception of dead bodies awaiting coroner's inquest, and also that further provision be made for the reception of dead bodies of persons who have died from infectious or contagious disease. The matter has been referred to a Special Committee, who are making enquiries as to the cost of erection and maintenance of such buildings, and the Committee hope shortly to make their report. Chalet. The Board granted permission for the erection of a Chalet de Toilette at the eastern end of Shepherd's Bush Common, and an agreement was entered into with the Company. The Chalet however, has not yet been erected, but the Company state that they will in all probability be in a position to commence the works shortly. 28 Dawes Lane Improvement. A service of Omnibuses having been put on between Hammersmith and Victoria, the line of route being through Dawes Lane, the Board took into consideration the great necessity that existed for widening the road at the entrance from Walham Green. Negotiations were entered into and the Hoard purchased the freehold and leasehold interests in the corner shop for the sum of £2,000, the premises were pulled down, and this long needed improvement has been carried out. The surplus land was sold to the freeholder of the adjoining premises for the sum of £250. There is another projection in the Road, viz. : St. John's Vicarage Garden, that requires to be removed, and the Board has entered into arrangements for the setting back of the wall to the line of the fence of the adjoining new buildings. The Board paying the sum of £200. Path—Victoria Road, near Board School. Great complaints having been received as to the state of the path by the Victoria Road Board Schools, the Board has carried out certain paving works in front of the Schools, at the expense of the London School Board. Fish Supply to Metropolis. In July last year the Board passed a resolution as follows: That this Board learn with dismay that the quantity of fish forwarded for sale to the immense population of London, is at present greatly restricted, not only by the want of market accommodation, but large quantities of fish were weekly destroyed as unfit for food, in consequencc of the delay in conveyance to the existing market, by reason of the want of proper approaches; and in view of the great importance of securing to such a vast population as is contained in greater London, the most ample and the very cheapest supply of food that it is possible to secure, this Board is of opinion, that the time has arrived when the Legislature should be asked to annul or modify the ancient charter, which empowers the Corporation of London to control, restrain, or prevent the creation of markets within the City of London, or within a radius of seven miles thereof, and the Board is further of opinion that the Metropolitan Board of Works should be empowered by Parliament to take the necessary steps for the creation or erection of a market or markets, with the necessary approaches by road, rail and river, believing that the creation of such market or markets, would result in the greatly increased supply of good 29 wholesome food to the metropolis and surrounding neighbourhood, at a much cheaper rate than is possible with the present utterly inadequate market accommodation. A copy of the above resolution was communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Borough and County Members, and the Vestries and District Boards in the metropolis. The whole question of the fish supply to the metropolis, was considered by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and a recommendation was brought up, recommending the Board to apply for Parliamentary power for the purchase of a site for a new market, but the Metropolitan Board by a majority of one rejected the report, and no further action has been taken by that Board in the matter. However, an independent scheme has been promoted in Parliament to authorize the establishment of a market at Shadwell, and it is hoped that the effort to provide this much needed accommodation may be successful. Bell's—Cellar Flaps. It being reported that two cellar flaps had been inserted in the path opposite the Rose and Crown, Parson's Green Lane, without the sanction of the Board, notice was served upon the owner to remove the same, this notice not being complied with, the Board, under the powers conferred upon them by the 102 sec., 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 102, filled in the openings and reinstated the path, the cost of the work being afterwards paid by the owner. Sewer Ventilator, Bradmore Park Road. Great complaints having been received as to the foul stench coming up the sewer ventilator in Bradmore Park Road, the Board, with the permission of the owner, carried a shaft from the ventilator up the side of one of the houses, and the nuisance complained of has been removed. Nuisance at Hammersmith Station,—manufacture of gas. At the end of last year the Board commenced an action in the Chancery Division against the Metropolitan Railway Company, with the view of putting a stop to the serious nuisance arising from the manufacture of gas from mineral oil at the Railway Company's Station in the Broadway. On the 13th January in this year, an order was made by Mr. Justice Kay restraining the Metropolitan Railway Company, until the trial of the action, from manufacturing gas at or near the Broadway Station in such a manner as to create a nuisance. 30 The operation of this injunction was suspended for two months, to enable the Company to remove their works or alter their mode of manufacture. The Company did not however comply with the order, and on the 26th of May last your Board succeeded in obtaining an order for sequestration of the property of the Company, to enforce compliance with the injunction, but the Court directed that the order should not be acted upon for one month. Before the month had expired the action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Chitty, and in the result the Metropolitan Railway Company were restrained by a perpetual injunction from manufacturing or permitting to be manufactured, and from using or permitting to be used, gas at or near the Broadway Station, in such a manner as to be or create a nuisance to the public. And the Railway Company were also ordered to pay the costs of the motions and of the action. Wood Lane. The legal proceedings that were commenced upon the apportionment for paving Wood Lane (South end) were abandoned, in consequence of there being so many difficulties in the way; but the Board continued the negotiations with owners of property on the West side of the road, and eventually carried out the paving of the path on that side at the cost of the owners. Builders—7 day's notice. Sec. 76., 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120. The Board has resolved to enforce the provisions of the Act of Parliament, and public notices have been issued informing builders that previous to the commencement of building operations, they will be required to give seven days' notice, as provided in this section. Widening Fulham Road, opposite Union. A proposal having been made by Sir William Palliser to give up certain land for the purpose of widening the Fulham Road, opposite the Union, the Board resolved that they would kerb and pave the path upon condition that the length of road as shewn on the plan, be widened to 50 feet. The building operations have not been commenced, so that the proposed improvement is not yet carried out. Ann's Terrace. The entrance to Ann's Terrace having been widened by the Railway Company, the Board was of opinion that the improvement should be further extended by the setting back of the fences of the first six houses, and the Board took steps under the Act 31 57, Geo. III. for that purpose, and terms were arranged with the owners ; the work has been carried out and a very great improvement effected. Improvement King Street West—Asprey. Terms having been arranged with the parties interested in the premises at the corner of Clifton Road, a portion of the premises has been set back, and the improvement, part of which was carried out last year, has been continued to the corner of Clifton Road. Wood Lane and Scrub Lane. Line of thoroughfare, from Uxbridge Road to Harrow Road. In consequence of the receipt of a letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Board addressed a communication to the owners of land abutting on this line of Road as follows:— "Board of Works for the Fulham District. (Clerk's Office) . Broadway House, Hammersmith, W. 18th February, 1882. Sir, Construction of the new thoroughfare from Uxbridge Road to Harrow Road. The District Board has had under lengthened consideration the desirability of opening up a direct route, by way of Wood Lane, the Scrubbs, and Scrubbs Lane, from Uxbridge Road to the Harrow Road, and is fully aware of the great importance of such a thoroughfare to the Northern part of this district and to the places adjacent thereto. The matter has also received the careful consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which Board has control of the Scrubbs, the road across that common forming a link in the line of route of the very highest value. The Metropolitan Board of Works has now addressed a communication to the District Board, in which it is stated that that Board ' has resolved, under the special circumstances of the case, to make up and put into proper condition for carriage and foot traffic, the road between the gates of Wormwood Scrubbs, as a portion of the line of thoroughfare between the Uxbridge Road and Harrow Road, and also to remove the gates ; and is further willing to contribute, under 32 the powers it possesses with reference to local improvements, one third of the cost incurred by the District Board in making up the remaining portion of the thoroughfare, conditionally upon the District Board undertaking to light and maintain in good repair the whole line of thoroughfare between Uxbridge Road and Harrow Road, and to pay to the Metropolitan Board one third of the contributions which the said District Board may receive from the adjoining owners. The Metropolitan Board of Works has submitted the foregoing proposal to the District Board, and has applied to the War Department for its consent to the proposed works, but no definite agreement has yet been come to for carrying the proposal into effect. The District Board feels, that however desirable it may be to effect this improvement, and it is thoroughly aware of the importance of the work, to impose the cost of making up this proposed thoroughfare (North and South of the Scrubbs) upon the general body of Ratepayers, would be at once a hardship and an injustice, and the Board will not feel itself justified in undertaking such an onerous burden. I am to point out to you that the primary and by far the largest benefit to be derived from the opening of this thoroughfare, will be received by the various owners and occupiers of land abutting upon the road, and the District Board is of opinion that a fair share of the cost of making the thoroughfare should be borne by such owners and occupiers. I am therefore directed to ask you to inform me at your early convenience what amount you are prepared to contribute towards the cost of the works, which is estimated at the rate of thirty shillings (30/-) per foot run ; I may perhaps add for your information that the cost of maintenance, cleansing, lighting, etc. is estimated at the rate of two thousand pounds per annum. Upon receipt of your reply, and the replies from other owners and occupiers, the District Board will be in a position to consider as to whether, having regard to the amount of contributions promised, it can consistently undertake to enter into the proposed agreement with the Metropolitan Board of Works. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board" 33 Certain arrangements have been made with some of the owners, and negotiations are still in progress with others, and the Board hopes that, by a combined effort, embracing contributions from the Metropolitan Board of Works, the owners of land adjoining the road, and the public funds, this most important work may be undertaken and carried to a successful issue. North End Lane, Red Cow Lane, Talgarth Road. The necessary steps have been taken under the Highways' Act for the stopping up and diverting of North End Lane from the end of Great Church Lane to North End Road, and in lieu thereof, has been constructed and dedicated to the public, the Talgarth Road, and the road bounding the land belonging to the Mercers' Company of London, Governors of St. Paul's School, upon which land the Governors are now erecting a new school. A great public improvement has been effected by the laying out of these new streets. Tramway—Uxbridge Road.—(Sale of). The Southall, Ealing and Shepherd's Bush Tramway; the Shepherd's Bush and Priory Road, Acton, Tramway; and the Shepherd's Bush and Hammersmith Tramways, have been sold to the West Metropolitan Tramway Company. Hammersmith Bridge. The Metropolitan Board of Works having determined to make certain alterations to Hammersmith Bridge, the Board resolved to endeavour to obtain a new bridge, and presented the following memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works:— "Hammersmith Bridge. To the Honourable the Metropolitan Board of Works. The humble memorial of the Board of Works for the Fulham District in the County of Middlesex, Sheweth, That your Memorialists, the Board of Works for the Fulham District, are charged by the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, with the care and control of the public highways within the said District, comprising the parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith, and containing an area of four thousand and three acres. That within the Fulham District, which has a frontage to the river Thames, of four miles and a half, extending from Chelsea to Chiswick, there are three Bridges crossing the river Thames, which provide the means of communication through and from the said Fulham District, and the Parishes 34 and places on the Surrey side of the Thames; and that the said Bridges, were, by the provisions of the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act, 1877, placed under the care and control of your honourable Board. That with respect to Fulham (otherwise Putney) Bridge, one of the said three Bridges, your honourable Board has already recognised the necessity that existed for improving the means of communication between the two banks of the River, and has obtained an Act, called the Metropolitan Bridges Act, 1881, in the preamble whereof it is recited, that whereas the said existing Fulham or Putney Bridge is in a dangerous condition and unfit for general traffic, it is expedient to made provision for enabling your honourable Board to build a new Bridge in lieu thereof: Your honourable Board, in pursuance of the powers conferred by the lastmentioned Act, has commenced the work of constructing a new Bridge at Fulham, in order to meet the growing requirements of the public ; And your Memorialists feel that the ratepayers, inhabitants of this District and the Metropolis at large, are deeply indebted to your honourable Board for the manner in which a great public need has been met and provided for, and the daily increasing traffic through the southern highways of your Memorialists' district accommodated. That your Memorialists are informed, and have reason to believe, that your honourable Board has also had under consideration the question of altering, strengthening, and improving Hammersmith Bridge. That your Memorialists desire to draw the attention of your honourable Board to the fact, that, in the year 1824, while the Bill for the building of Hammersmith Bridge was before Parliament, it was publicly reported that some of the 'reasons in favour of the proposed Bridge of Suspension at Hammersmith,' were:— That a communication across the Thames by a Bridge at Hammersmith, has now become absolutely necessary to the Neighbourhood, and would be of great general benefit and convenience. At present an extensive and increasing population are obliged to submit to the inconvenience of a circuitous road of at least five miles to arrive at places from which the River alone separates them. The Roads and approaches to Hammersmith out of Hertfordshire, and the northern part of Middlesex, arc become 35 very numerous, and nothing prevents their extension into Surrey and Sussex, but the want of a Bridge at the proposed spot. The intended line of road on the Surrey side of the Bridge would lead directly to Barnes Common, from whence roads branch off to all the South and South Western parts of the Kingdom. The distance from London to Richmond by Hyde Park Corner will be considerably shortened, and an easier communication (avoiding the hills of Putney and Wimbledon) would be made to Kingston by way of Richmond. Through Kingston lies the great road to Portsmouth and other important places south-west of London. The proposed bridge would be only three miles and a half from Hyde Park Corner, possessing the advantage of having for its approach the Great Western Road. From Oxford Street by Shepherd's Bush it would be about the same distance as from Hyde Park Corner. That upon the Parliamentary power being obtained the existing Bridge was built and was opened for traffic in the year 1827. That your Memorialists are informed, and have reason to believe, that the existing Hammersmith Bridge is not of sufficient width, or of sufficient strength, to take the daily increasing heavy general traffic that passes through the highways of your Memorialists' district, and over the said Bridge, to and from the parishes and places on the Surrey side of the River. That in the Broadway, at the entrance to the approach road to the said Hammersmith Bridge, there converge five leading thoroughfares, viz.: King Street West, Beadon Road, Queen Street, King Street East, aud Brook Green Road. That through King Street West and Beadon Road there passes, to the said Bridge, a large and daily increasing amount of heavy and general traffic, coming from that portion of your Memorialists' district lying north-west of the Broadway and Brook Green Road, from the adjoining parishes of Chiswick, Acton, and Ealing, and from the places adjacent thereto. That through Queen Street there passes a further large amount of general traffic to the Bridge, coming from that portion of your Memorialists' district traversed by the Crown Road and Dawes Road, which part of the Fulham District is being rapidly built over and inhabited by a dense population. In addition to this local traffic, these roads accommodate the very heavy general traffic which passes through main arterial 36 thoroughfares of London, such as Piccadilly, Brompton Road, South Kensington, Old Brompton, etc., and the traffic which comes from the densely populated neighbourhoods adjacent thereto. That through King Street East and Brook Green Road, there passes the general traffic from the populous streets adjacent thereto, and in addition to this local traffic, these roads accommodate the enormous amount of heavy general traffic which passes along the main Great Western Road of London, and Brook Green Road accommodates the traffic coming from and through London by way of Holborn and Oxford Street, the densely populated neighbourhoods adjacent thereto, and the important districts lying north and north-west of the Metropolis. That in addition to the existing heavy general traffic, your Memorialists believe, that upon the opening of the thoroughfare in continuation of Wood Lane, across the Scrubbs, to the Harrow Road, a large additional amount of traffic will have to be accommodated, coming from that portion of the Metropolis lying north of the Wormwood Scrubbs, which large area is being converted from arable and garden ground into building land, and rapidly covered with houses. It is believed that the opening of the new thoroughfare in question will cause this large area to develope with increased speed, and that the new thoroughfare will be required to accommodate traffic coming therefrom, and from the adjacent neighbourhoods lying north-west of the Metropolis. That a very large amount of the heavy general traffic traversing the before-mentioned important highways in your Memorialists district, is composed of vehicles and pedestrians, drawn, not only from your Memorialists' district, but from the Metropolis generally, from the parishes and places adjoining the Metropolis, and from the general traffic daily passing and repassing through Greater London, and the whole of such traffic requiring to cross and recross the Thames at Hammersmith Bridge, both vehicular and pedestrian, has to pass through the two narrow arches of the suspension towers, where the fairway is fourteen feet only, and great danger and considerable delay is occasioned by the contraction of the highway at these two points. That while in the year 1827 the accommodation provided may have been amply sufficient for the requirements of that time, your Memorialists respectfully desire to point out, that since that period, the Metropolis has grown with gigantic strides, 37 as evidenced by a reference to the returns of population at the decennial census. The population of London was in the year 1821 1,378.947 1831 1,654,994 1841 1,948,417 1851 2,362,236 1861 2,803,989 1871 3,254,260 1881 3,814,571 Or an increase of about 276 per cent. since the year 1821, and the population of "Greater London," in 1881, was returned as 4,764,312. That as further evidence that additional accommodation is urgently required, it may be fairly stated, that the purely local traffic must of necessity have greatly increased since the Bridge was opened, and your Memorialists beg to refer to the following tables showing the growth of population, &c., in your Memorialists' district, and in the two parishes adjacent to the Bridge on the Surrey side of the River.

That your Memorialists do not presume to point out to your honourable Board the alleged weakness and consequent insecurity of the existing Bridge, as your Memorialists are informed that the facts in connexion with the structural defects of the Bridge have been already fully reported upon by the officers of your honorable Board. That your Memorialists submit, that the existing Bridge at Hammersmith, with its narrow fair way, of fourteen feet only, through the two suspension towers, is dangerous and unfit for general traffic, and is utterly inadequate to meet the exigencies of the present greatly increased and rapidly increasing traffic, which crosses and recrosses the said Bridge; that having regard to the statistics relating to London, to Greater London, to the Parish of Hammersmith, and the other parishes enumerated, the time has now arrived when your honorable Board should be asked to make provision for the 40 building of a new Bridge over the Thames at Hammersmith, of such width, character and design, as will be fitted to meet the growing necessities of the public traffic between the Middlesex and Surrey banks of the Thames at this point. Your Memorialists therefore humbly pray that your honorable Board may be pleased to promote in Parliament, a Bill to enable your honorable Board to undertake the construction of a new Bridge at Hammersmith, and to take such other steps in the premises as to your honorable Board may seem meet. And your Memorialists will ever pray. By Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. February, 1882. The reply received from the Metropolitan Board is as follows: [Copy Letter.] " Metropolitan Board of Works. Spring Gardens, S.W. March 23rd, 1882. No. 1445. B. 17. 3. Sir, Referring to the memorial presented to the Board by a deputation from the Fulham District Board of Works on the 17th ultimo, asking the Board, in consideration of the facts and circumstances stated in the memorial, to build a new bridge at Hammersmith ; I am directed to inform you that the subject has received the careful attention of the Board, and that after fully considering all the circumstances, the Board has come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to build an entirely new bridge. The Board has, however, resolved that with a view to strengthen the bridge and also to provide increased accommodation for the traffic, the superstruction shall be entirely reconstructed, and the southern pier underpinned. The reconstruction in the manner proposed, will have the effect of giving an additional width of 41 8 feet to the carriage-way and of I foot 9 inches to each of the foot-ways. Instructions have been given for the preparation of the plans and specification for the works. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIELD, The Clerk of Clerk of the Board. The Fulham District Board, Broadway House, Hammersmith." The Metropolitan Board has since that date approved of plans for certain alterations and improvements to the bridge, and tenders will be shortly taken for carrying out the works. Fulham Bridge. The Metropolitan Board having obtained the necessary Parliamentary powers, have completed arrangements for the building of a new bridge between Fulham and Putney, at a site closely adjoining that now occupied by the Chelsea Water Works Company's Aqueduct, and provision will be made for carrying the pipes of the aqueduct in the structure of the new bridge; a temporary aqueduct is now being formed, preparatory to removing the existing one and commencing the new bridge. The contract for the new bridge and works has been undertaken by Mr. John Waddell, of Edinburgh, at the sum of £240,433 „ 19 „ 0. Parson's Green. This Green having been taken under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works to be preserved as an open space for the recreation of the public for ever, the Board has resolved to carry out certain curbing and other works round the Green at an estimated cost of £ 1,815, to be raised by loan. School Board Precept. The precept received from the London School Board is yearly increasing, and the Board desires to point out to the ratepayers, that although the sum demanded by the School Board must be included in the yearly estimates, the Board has no control whatever over the expenditure of the School Board. The Board has called the special attention of the School Board to the continued increase, with a view to their taking such steps as they may deem necessary, in order to bring about greater economy in the administration of the funds entrusted to their control. 42 Horse Trough and Wall, Blythe Lane. The Board, in order to remove the unsightly obstruction at the Freemasons' Arms, Blythe Lane, took steps for acquiring the Horse Trough and Wall and land in front of the public house. As terms could not be arranged, a jury was empanelled as provided by 57 Geo. III.,Cap. 29—and the jury have awarded to the freeholder the sum of .£300, and to the leaseholder the sum of £440. The claims having been—freeholder £350, leaseholder £850. High Street, Fulham, hnprovement. The Board has had under consideration for many years the great necessity for improving the entrance to High Street, Fulham at the junction with the London Road, and has now purchased the freeholder's and leaseholder's interests in Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 10a, High Street; these properties will be shortly pulled down, and the desired improvement carried out. Cattle Trough, Queen Street. By the kindness of an anonymous donor through the Metropolitan Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain Association, a granite trough has been erected in Queen Street, opposite the Police Station, there being previously no public trough between Hyde Park Gate and Kew Bridge. The trough will remain during the pleasure of the Board, and has already proved a great boon to the daily increasing number of persons driving through the town. 43 LIST OF CONTRACTS Entered into by the Board for the twelve months, commencing Ist of April-, 1881, and CTiding March 31 st, 1882. 6th April, 1881.

CONSTRUCTION OF SEWERS. The Board of Works for the Fulham District hereby give notice to Landowners, Builders, and others whom it may concern, that the following rules and regulations have been made for the information and guidance of the public in relation to the construction of Sewers by persons other than the said Board within the parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith forming the district under the control of the said Board. RULES AND REGULATIONS. (Pursuant to provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts.) I. That before any person or persons shall construct, make or branch any sewer, for the purposes of draining any land, Road, Street, place or premises, within the aforesaid parishes of Fulham or Hammersmith, into any sewer within the said District,—such person or persons shall obtain the consent (in writing) of the aforesaid District Board. II. That in applying for such consent as aforesaid, the person or persons making such application must obtain and fill-up a form to be furnished by the Board, and send with such application three copies (3) of a plan of the land. road, street, place, or premises in which it is proposed to construct a sewer, drawn upon tracing linen to a scale of 88 feet to an inch ; and there shall be shown upon such plan the position, course and dimensions of the proposed sewer, with a section and cross-section thereof, together with such other information as from time to time may be required by the Board. III. That having obtained such written consent to the construction of a sewer, no abandonment, extension, contraction, or alteration of such sewer shall be made without the previous sanction and approval in writing of the aforesaid District Board. IV. That in case any sewer, sanctioned or approved as aforesaid, be not structed or executed within twelve calendar months from the date of sanction or approval, the works for the construction of such sewer shall not be executed without a fresh permission being applied for and obtained in manner hereinbefore provided by rules I and II. V. In case any person, without the consent of the District Board, make or branch, or cause to be made or branched, any sewer or drain, or make any opening into any of the sewers within the said District, or if any person make or branch, or cause to be made or branched, any sewers 68 of a different construction, size, material, or other conditions, or in another manner or form than shall be directed or appointed by the aforesaid District Board; every person so offending shall for every such offence, forfeit a sum not exceeding Fifty Pounds; and the Board may cut off the connection with such sewer.—Penalty: 25 and 26 Vic. Cap. 102, Sec. 61. VI. The person or persons making application under these Regulations will be required to lodge a sum sufficient to meet the expenses of the Board for supervision of the Works, such sum to be fixed at the time of granting the application.—See Note. Any further information required and forms of application for permission to construct sewers, etc., may be obtained of the Surveyor at the Offices of the Board. Approved and ordered to be printed, 4th April, 1877. By Order, THOMAS EDWARD JONES, Clerk to the Board. Broadway House, Hammersmith, W. REGULATION No. IV. amended by addition of words following Note.—That when the plans are approved, the owner or builder of thy Sewer as the case may be, shall give to the Surveyor to the Board seven days notice (in writing) of the date of his intention to commence, and of the quantity of work he intends to execute under such notice; and to deposit a sum equivalent to one guinea per week; or such other sum as may be considered necessary, for so many weeks as the works may be in progress; and if such time be exceeded, then a further notice shall be given and further suit shall be paid at the same rate.

To the Fulham District Board of Works. Gentlemen,— Last year was a very eventful one in reference to the sanitary work of your Board. The severe epidemic of smallpox occupied a great deal of time and consideration. We can not do otherwise than review the work with satisfaction. Many difficulties presented themselves, particularly in reference to dealing with the epidemic. These difficulties were met, to say the least, in a very satisfactory manner. Your Board was involved in several costly actions in the Court of Chancery. In some of these you were the plaintiffs and in some the defendants, but in all cases the actions were satisfactorily terminated. A large number of the inhabitants of the district were at one time greatly incensed against your Board for having erected a temporary Small-pox Hospital, but I venture to state that there are very few now who would not own that the course which you adopted, and to which they offered such strong opposition, was in the interests of humanity. There can be no doubt that a large number of lives were saved and a large amount of affliction was prevented by the action which you took. The Fulham district comprises an area of 4003 acres and an estimated population in the middle of last year of 116,000 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three sub-districts, namely:—Fulham, which is the parish of Fulham; 70 and St. Peter's and St. Paul's, which together make the parish of Hammersmith. For the sake of brevity these sub-districts are hereafter called Fulham, St. Peter's, and St. Paul's. Fulham comprises an area of 1,716 statute acres, St. Paul's 2,102, and St. Peter's 185. On the 3rd day of April, 1881, when the census was last taken, the population of Fulham was 42,900 inhabitants, that of St. Peter's and St. Paul's together i.e. Hammersmith Parish 71,939 inhabitants. The estimated population of the whole district on the 31st of last December was 120,000 inhabitants. The calculations in this report are based upon the population estimated in the middle of the year. On the 31st of last December there were 18,819 inhabited houses in the district against 16,548 in the previous year. On the population estimated at the end of last year there was an average of 6.31 persons to each house. Of the 18,819 inhabited houses at the end of last year, 11,920 were in the parish of Hammersmith, and 6,899 in the parish of Fulham, against 11,000 in the parish of Hammersmith, and 5,548 in the parish of Fulham at the end of the previous year. There was, therefore, an increase of 2,271 in the number of inhabited houses in the whole district last year, of which number 920 were in the parish of Hammersmith, and 1,351 were in the parish of Fulham. In the middle of last year there was an average of 29.0 persons to an acre in this district, while there was an average of 50.8 persons to each acre in the whole of London. A very large number of new houses were built in this district last year and a great many are still being constructed. So active have the building operations been that the supply of new houses has been greater than the demand for them, and the consequence is that there is a very large number of uninhabited houses in the district. The number of deaths registered in this district last year was 2,473 (males 1,231, females 1,242), being one death to every 46.9 of the population, against 2,217 in the previous year which equalled one death to each 50.9. The average number of deaths registered during the last ten years was 1,948. Making due allowance for the increase of population the deaths last year were 37 above the corrected decennial average. This mortality includes all the deaths registered in the district. If however we deduct the 223 deaths of non-parishioners that took place at theMetropolitan Asylum Small-pox Hospital at Fulham, allowing the deaths of non-parishioners that took place in the West London Hospital and other public institutions, to go as compensative allowance for the unknown deaths of parishioners which may have taken place in general hospitals and other public insti- 7 tutions outside the district, the corrected mortality for last year was 2250. The gross annual death rate therefore taking the deaths as registered (2,473) was 21.3 per 1,000 persons living, being .1 greater than the death rate of all London which was 21.2. The corrected mortality rate for this district was 19.3, being 1.9 less than that of all London. Of the deaths registered in this district last year 117 took place in St. Peter's, 1,188 in St. Paul's, and 1.168 in Fulham, against 120 in St. Peter's, 1,158 in St. Paul's, and 939 in Fulham, the previous year. The average number of deaths registered in the three sub-districts during the last five years was, St. Peter's 124, St. Paul's 1079, and Fulham 1,008. There was therefore, last year, as compared with the average mortality during the last five years, a decrease of 7 deaths in St. Peter's, an increase of 109 deaths in St. Paul's, and an increase of 160 deaths in Fulham. The increase in the number of deaths in St. Paul's is to be accounted for by the very cold winter, and by the increase of population through immigration. The increase in the number of deaths in Fulham was due to the large number of deaths of non-parishioners (223) which took place at the Metropolitan Asylum Small-pox Hospital at Fulham. When we take into consideration the fact that a very severe epidemic of small-pox existed last year, through which 44 deaths of parishioners were registered in this district, and when we consider the great increase in the population that has taken place, we can have no difficulty in perceiving the cause of a slight increase in the number of deaths registered. TABLE I. The following table shows the deaths registered in the three sub-districts in the years 1880-1881, also the average number in the five years 1877-1881:— Year. Sub-district of Fulham. Sub-district of St. Paul's. Sub-district of St. Peter's. 1880 939 1158 120 1881 1168 1188 117 Average of 5 years 1877-1881 1008 1079 124 t The number of deaths of infants at one year of age and under was 707, against 652 in the previous year. There were 35 in St. Peter's, 359 in St. Paul's, and 313 in Fulham, against 26 in St. Peter's, 33.1 in St. Paul's, and 295 in Fulham, during the previous year. These deaths were equal to 28.6 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and 15.7 per cent. of the total registered births. 72 The per centage of these deaths in the whole of London was 24.1 to the total deaths registered, and 14.8 to the total registered births. In the three sub-districts the per centage of deaths at one year of age and under to the total deaths and total births respectively, was, St. Peter's 29.9 and 15.8, St. Paul's 30.2 and I4.9, Fulham 26.8 and 16.7. In all of the three sub-districts therefore the per centage of deaths of infants to the total deaths and total births was greater than that of London. The per centage of deaths of infants is always slightly greater in this district than in London. This is attributable to the fact that there is in this district a large proportion of poor class inhabitants. The infantile mortality rate in this district was slightly lower last year than the year previous. The number of deaths at 60 years of age and upwards was 454, of which there were 35 in St. Peter's, 359 in St. Paul's, and 313 in Fulham, against 24 in St. Peter's, 227 in St. Paul's, and 181 in Fulham, registered the previous year. These deaths were equal to 18.4 per cent. of the total deaths registered, while the per centage of the same in all London was 21.0. The rapid development of the district that has taken place during the last decade and the large number of young persons who have come to reside in the newly constructed houses is the cause of the senile mortality rate being lower than that of all London.

The following table shows the mean temperature; the number of births; the number of deaths; the number of persons to each acre; the population; the proportion of births to each 1,000 persons living; the proportion of deaths to each 1,000 persons living; and the proportion of persons living to each death in each of the 10 years, 1872-1881:— Year.

The slight increase in the mortality rate is owing to the large number (223) of non-parishioners who died last year from small-pox at the Metropolitan Asylum Smallpox Hospital at Fulham. The fact that the mortality rate last year was only .4 above the decennial average, although the density of the population has increased from 17.2 persons per acre to 29.0 during the last ten years, and although there was an exceptionally severe epidemic of small-pox last year is satisfactory, and is an indication of an improved state of public health. TABLE III. The following table shows the number of deaths of each sex registered in each of the four quarters of the year 1881 in the Fulham District:— Sub-district of St. Peter's.

The number of deaths were increased in the first quarter from bronchial diseases, the result of the low temperature. In the third quarter the mortality rate was increased from enteric diseases, such as diarrhoea. The increase in the mortality rate which always takes place in cold and damp weather, is evidence of the necessity for persons, particularly the aged and young, being protected against cold. In warm weather germs are deposited from the atmosphere on food, and being rapidly developed into living organisms, they set up active decomposition. Such food when eaten becomes a source of irritation in the intestines and produces diarrhoea. In 74 very old persons and young children, whose vitality is weak, these attacks of diarrhoea are very apt to end fatally. It is important that no stale food should be eaten in warm weather, and that articles of diet should be thoroughly cooked. Attention to these well known facts would prevent many serious illnesses that occur in hot weather. The deaths of females exceeded those of males by nine. When we take into consideration the fact that there are nearly ten thousand more females than males in the district, it will be readily seen that the relative mortality of males was greater than that of females. More male children are annually born in London, yet owing to the greater mortality among males there is a much greater number of females living. The number of births registered in this district last year was 4,513 (males 2,308, females 2,205), against 4,195 in the previous year. The number of births of males exceeded that of the females by 103. Of the 4,513 births registered last year there were 222 in St. Peter's (males 112, females 110); 2,412 in St. Paul's (males 1,246, females 1,166); 1879 in Fulham (males 950, females 929). The birth rate in the whole district was at the rate of 38 9 births per annum per 1,000 persons living, being one birth to each 257 persons. The birth rate in the whole of London was equal to 347 per annum per 1,000 persons living. The births exceeded the deaths in this district last year by 2,040, and exceeded the number of births the previous year by 318. Estimating that the population has increased 2,500 in the year, 2,040 of this number was due to excess of births over deaths, and 460 to immigration. TABLE IV. The following table shows the quarterly numbers of births of each sex registered in the three sub-districts of the Fulham district during the year 1880:— Qrtr. Sub-district of St. Peter's. Sub-district of St. Paul's. Sub-district of Fulham. Grand Total. Males. Females. Total. Males. Females. Total. Males. Females.

The corrected number, therefore, of deaths from this class of diseases was 400, as compared with 405, the corrected number of deaths registered from the same class of diseases during the previous year. Thus we see that there was a comparative decrease of five in the number of these deaths last year, although there was an increase in the population to the extent of 2,500 inhabitants. It is somewhat satisfactory to notice that the actual number of deaths from this class of disease was decreased, although there was a very severe epidemic of smallpox. The corrected deaths from zymotic diseases registered last year were equal to I7.8 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 3.4 deaths per annum per 1,000 living persons. The deaths from these diseases in the whole of London were equal to 17.2 per cent. of the total deaths registered and were at the rate of 3.6 per annum per 1,000 persons living. There was, therefore, last year in this district a greater per centage of deaths from zymotic diseases than in all London, as compared with the total number of deaths registered, but a smaller proportion as compared with the population. The higher per centage as compared with the total deaths is attributable to the large proportion of poor inhabitants in this district. There is always a greater fatality from these diseases among the poor classes than among the rich. Of the 400 deaths from zymotic diseases which occurred last year, there were 18 in St. Peter's, against 13 the previous year; 220 in St. Paul's, against 228 the previous year; and 162 in Fulham, against 164 the previous year. Thus we see that there was an increase of 5 in the number of these deaths in St. Peter's and a decrease of 8 and 2 in St. Paul's and Fulham respectively. TABLE V. The following table shows the deaths from zymotic diseases (exclusive of those of non-parishioners that took place at the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham) registered in the Fulham district in the years 1880-1881:— 76  Year 1880.

Smallpox Epidemic. A severe outbreak of smallpox occurred in the East end of London towards the end of the year 1880. At the end of January, 1881, the Western districts of the Metropolis became infected, and during the month of February a considerable number of cases were reported in this district. At the commencement of the month of December, 1880, I prognosticated that there was going to be a severe epidemic, and you will remember that I gave it as my opinion that the hospital accommodation which was then provided at the several smallpox hospitals, would not be anything like sufficient for the isolation of the cases that would require removal. I strongly advised your Board to provide additional and independent accommodation for the cases that I thought would occur in this district. My inference was proved to be only too correct, as may be seen by reference to tables VI. and VII. To be forewarned was to be forearmed. If I am not very much mistaken the Fulham district was the only district in London in which on case of smallpox was left at home owing to the want of a vacant bed at the hospital. In some of the districts of London hundreds of cases had to be left at home to spread the disease, and consequently there was a great sacrifice of human life. By reference to table VIII, it may be seen that the number of deaths from smallpox in this district last year was only one 77 above the average number during the last five years. By reference to the same table, it will be seen that in nearly all the other districts of London the number of deaths last year was greatly in excess of the average during the same period. In one district there were as many as 145 deaths above the average. No improvement in sanitary law, in reference to the prevention of infectious diseases, has taken place since I presented my last annual report. Our Government seem at length to recognise the necessity for further legislative enactment on the subject, and a Royal Hospitals' Commission has been appointed to enquire into the question and to report to the House of Commons. I had the honor to give evidence before the Royal Commission, a copy of that evidence will be laid before your Board after the report has been made to the House. It is greatly to be hoped that the subject will be now effectually dealt with, and that the large sacrifice of human life which has occurred from this terrible complaint may be for the future prevented. I can see no reason why smallpox, if properly dealt with, should continue to exist, except as an occasional isolated case. In London last year there were 2371 deaths from smallpox, as compared with 475 the previous year. There were therefore nearly five times as many cases last year as the year previous. In this district there were 46 deaths of parishioners against 11 the previous year, which equals about 4 to 1. It is reasonable to assume that the large amount of energy that was expended to prevent the disease from spreading, was the means of this district being one of the least infected districts of London. During last year 327 cases of smallpox—males 177, females 150—were reported in this district, against 328, 266, 166, and 51 cases reported in the four years 1877, 1878, 1879,1880 respectively. From the number of deaths, 6 registered as occurring in private dwelling houses, we may estimate there were very few cases treated at home besides the 50 that were reported. Of the 327 cases reported last year, there were 82 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 9 the previous year, and 245 in the parish of Fulham, against 42 the previous year. It is a remarkable fact that there is always a very much larger number of cases in the parish of Fulham than in the parish of Hammersmith, although there is in the parish of Hammersmith a very much larger population than in the parish of Fulham. I have no doubt that the difference in the numbers of cases in the two parishes is to some extent due to the fact that a large number of non-parishioners suffering from the disease, have been treated at the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham. This evil is for the present removed ; still, taking all the circumstances of the two parishes 78 into consideration, I shall, when smallpox again breaks out, expect to find a greater proportion of cases occurring in the Fulham than in the Hammersmith parish. I do not however expect to find that there will be anything like the same difference as heretofore. These 327 cases occurred in 231 houses, in 158 streets. In 113 streets the outbreak was confined to 1 house in each street. 85 cases occurred singly in different houses in different streets. In 45 streets there was more than 1 house infected in each street. Thus in 1 street there were 10 houses infected; in 1 street 6 houses; in 1 street 5 houses; in 1 street 4 houses; in 11 streets 3 houses in each street; and in 30 streets 2 houses in each street. In 182 houses there was only 1 case in each house. In 49 houses there was more than 1 case in each house. Thus in 1 house there were 8 cases; in 1 house 7 cases; in 1 house 6 cases; in 1 house 5 cases; in 8 houses 4 cases in each house; in 11 houses 3 cases in each house; and in 26 houses 2 cases in each house. Of the 327 persons attacked, 261 had been once vaccinated; 30 had never been vaccinated; in the remaining 36 cases, no information as to vaccination was obtained. In no case was any evidence obtained that the patient had been re-vaccinated. The ages varied from 2 weeks to 73 years; the average age was 23.6 years. There were 46 deaths of parishioners of this district. This would give a mortality rate of 14.0 per cent. It is calculated upon the number of cases reported, and no allowance is made for the concealed cases which probably equalled about 133. Taking these into the calculation, the mortality rate would be about 10 per cent. Of the total cases reported, 277 were treated at hospitals and properly isolated; 50 cases were treated at the residences of the patients. 267 cases were removed by your Board; 1 case by the Fulham Board of Guardians; 6 patients walked to the hospital; 1 was removed by St. George's Hospital authorities; and 1 by St. Thomas's Hospital authorities. These latter 2 patients applied to the hospitals for medical advice, not knowing the nature of their complaints. They were at once removed to the Metropolitan Asylum Smallpox Hospital at Fulham. 227 cases were isolated at the Metropolitan Asylum Smallpox Hospital at Fulham; 7 at the Metropolitan Asylum Smallpox Hospital at Stockwell; 24 at the Cottage Hospital at the Fulham Union Workhouse; and 19 at the Tent Hospital erected by your Board at the end of Imperial Road in the parish of Fulham. The per centage of cases removed to hospitals was 847 as compared with a per centage of 90.2 in the year 1880. It is probable that the per centage of concealed cases has greatly decreased, for as has been before stated, there were only 6 deaths from the disease registered as occurring in private dwelling houses. This 79 would represent about 183 cases treated at home, of which number 50 were reported and 133 concealed. Of the 82 cases reported in the parish of Hammersmith, 73 were removed to hospitals and properly isolated, 9 were treated at home. Of the 245 in the parish of Fulham, 204 were removed to hospitals, 41 were treated at home. Thus of the reported cases in Hammersmith, 8902 per cent. were properly isolated, and of those in Fulham, 83.27. It is more than likely that the per centage of concealed cases in the parish of Fulham was greater than in the parish of Hammersmith. Of the 50 cases that were treated at home, 6 were not reported till after the death, and 23 till after the recovery of the patients. In 21 cases the patients or their relatives refused to allow removal. The accommodation in these cases was not sufficient for the effectual isolation of the patients, but was not sufficiently bad within the meaning of the 26 section of the Sanitary Act to justify an application to the Magistrate to enforce removal. In almost every instance where a case was early reported and at once removed to a hospital, there was no second outbreak in the same house. On the other hand, in very many instances where cases were not early reported or were not removed, other persons contracted the disease in the same dwelling. TABLE VI. The following table shows the number of cases of smallpox that were reported in each of the parishes of the Fulham district during each of the twelve months of the year 1882, also the number of cases that were treated at hospitals and those that were treated at the homes of the patients.

It is a curious fact that for a rule there is a very much larger number of cases in the first half of the year than in the second. It is usually the case that the disease almost entirely disappears towards the latter end of June. Last year, however, owing to the virulence and extent of the epidemic, the disease did not disappear until the month of December. It is satisfactory to be able to report that during the present year (1882) there has been almost a total absence of the disease in this district. TABLE VII.

The first case occurred on January 30th, and the second outbreak took place on February 28th, when two persons were attacked with the disease. The fourth case, which was reported on March 6th, was probably contracted from the second outbreak, before the second case was reported. It is probable that there was some infected article retained in the house, which accidentally escaped disinfection, or it might be that there was a common cause for the first and second outbreak. Of two cases that occurred at Kidder's Place, the first had been treated at home for several days before it was discovered. The second person had contracted the disease three days before any information was obtained of the first outbreak. Of three cases which took place at a house in Caroline Place and which were reported on February 13th, 25th and 26th, the first case was not reported till after the fourth day of the illness, or before the latter three patients had contracted the disease. Of the three cases at Field Road, reported February 21st, 24th and March 1st, all of the patients had caught the disease before the first case was reported. There was said to have been a case of chicken pox treated in the house some few weeks before. It is more than probable that this was a modified case of smallpox, and was the source from whence the other patients caught the disease. At Grove Terrace there were two cases reported, one on the 17th and the other on the 19th of March. Both of these patients probably caught the disease from the same source. There were four cases at a house in Church Street. The second person who was attacked, was heard of through the death returns on the 19th of March. Upon an inspection of the house being made, it was discovered that there was another person in the same dwelling who had recovered from the disease. The third and fourth cases were reported on March 29th and 30th, both of these had evidently contracted the disease before the death of the first patient. There were two cases at a house at North End Road, which were reported on March 23rd. Both the patients caught the disease about the same time and probably from the same source. There were five cases at a house at Waldo Road, College Park, which were reported on the 8th and 10th of March. They all contracted the disease about the same time, and probably from one common means of infection. There were eight cases at a house called Archer Buildings in 86 Havelock Road. They were reported on March 16th, 17th, 20th, 24th and 28th. The first case was not reported, but treated at home without medical advice for a period of about three weeks. This is a very instructive instance of the evil effects that follow the non-isolation of the disease. It is most satisfactory, however, to be able to record that no fresh person contracted the disease after the first case was reported to your Sanitary Department. Archer Buildings is a large lodging house, containing upwards of 70 inmates, and although eight persons had contracted the disease before the first case was reported, not one single person caught the complaint after the first case was known of by your officers. At a house at Farm Lane, the patient, although there was not proper accommodation for effectual isolation of the case, refused to allow removal. The accommodation was sufficiently bad to justify an application to the magistrate for an order to enforce removal. The order was granted by the learned magistrate and executed. The patient was against his will removed to the Metropolitan Asylum Small-pox Hospital at Fulham. He has since recovered from the disease and returned to his home. I am informed by one of the Sanitary Inspectors, that he, the patient, now expresses himself in terms of gratitude and satisfaction for the course that I deemed it my painful duty to adopt. At a house in Waterford Road, there were three cases. The first case was not reported but treated at home. The husband was allowed to sleep in the same room in which the patient his wife was being treated. The result was that he caught the disease and died. The first information obtained was in the death returns in which the second case was registered. Upon visiting and inspecting the other rooms of the house it was found that a youth of 17 years of age had also contracted the disease. The second and third cases might have easily been prevented had the first been immediately reported and removed to a hospital. At a house in Estcourt Road there were four cases. In the first that occurred the symptoms were so slight that the relatives did not suppose that the patient had small-pox, and they did not obtain any medical advice. Three other persons contracted the disease from this case. The three latter cases might easily have been prevented had the first case been diagnosed, reported, and removed to a hospital. At a house in Ashford Road there were two cases. The first was treated at home, and not reported until a second person had been attacked by the disease, which was contracted from the first case. 87 At Cambridge Terrace there were two cases in one house. The first was treated at home, and the second outbreak was the result of the first case. At a house in Elrick Street there were three cases. The first was reported on April 27th, when it was found that the patient had been ill for several days. The symptoms had so far disappeared that it was not possible to decide absolutely whether it was a case of small-pox or not, a second case was reported on May 9th and another on May 10th. These latter two cases were undoubtedly the result of the first case. Both of them might have been prevented had the first case been reported earlier and removed at once. At a house in Latymer Road there were 7 cases. The first case that occurred was not reported, nor was any medical advice obtained. The consequence was that six other persons afterwards caught the disease from this case. At a house at Anselm Road there were six cases. The first case was not removed and consequently five other persons contracted the disease afterwards in the same house. The five latter cases undoubtedly might have been prevented had the first case been immediately removed to a hospital when the patient was first attacked with the disease. The above statistics point clearly to the unquestionable advantage obtained by the early removal and proper isolation of cases of small-pox. We see, on the one hand, that where patients were at once removed directly they were known to be suffering from small-pox, almost without exception, no fresh person contracted the disease in the same house. On the other hand, where cases were not early removed, or treated at home, in most instances other persons in the same house caught the complaitit. TABLE VIII.

The epidemic continued still further to increase in severity, and in the first week of May you were obliged to use the cottage at the Fulham Union Workhouse, for the isolation of seven cases of small pox. Between this date and the 27th of April 16 more cases were taken to this Union Hospital. Of the 23 cases treated at the Fulham Union 4 died there, the others were removed before recovery to the Metropolitan Asylum Small-pox Hospital by your Board. On April the 27th, there were 7 cases of small-pox which required immediate removal, and it was found that there was not a vacant bed to be obtained in London. Under my directions an 89 ency Committee of your Board was called, when I laid before them the facts of the case. I pointed out to them that an inevitable destruction of human life would occur unless some prompt action was taken to isolate these cases. I reminded the Committee that I had forewarned your Board that the serious state of affairs which then existed would come to pass, and I pointed out to them that my advice had not been carried out by provision in the way of hospital accommodation being made for the isolation of cases which would require removal in this district. The Committee, after visiting several sites, passed a resolution to erect Hospital Marquees at the end of Imperial Road, in the parish of Fulham. The order was given by your Committee on April 27th, at 4 p.m., and the erection of it was placed in the hands of your clerk and myself. A very large number of men were at once employed, and telegrams were dispatched in very many directions. The work was carred on by torch-light all through the night, and at 3 p.m. the following day every thing was in readiness, and the first patient was admitted. Altogether there were 19 patients removed to these tents, 13 were discharged cured and 6 died. Of the 6 that died, in one case the patient was received two days after giving birth to a child, and she died from exhausition, the result of secondary hcemorrhage the second day after her admission. The child was attacked with the disease a few days afterwards and died. In the third case the patient was suffering from variole hoemorrhagica, an always fatal complaint. The other three were cases of variola confluens, the patients died from exhaustion. A great deal of public agitation was made about the action taken by your Board, and a mass meeting of the inhabitants was called with the view of condemning the course you had adopted. It was rumoured that the mob were going to pull down the tents. It was therefore deemed to be necessary to call out about 120 armed police. Fortunately a very heavy shower of rain fell at the time appointed for the mass meeting to assemble. The inclemency of the weather had the effect of cooling the mob, and the result was that after having passed two or three resolutions in condemnation of the action you had taken, the meeting terminated without any attempt at violence The Gas Light and Coke Company were not so easily satisfied, but applied in the name of the Attorney General to the Court of Chancery for an interlocutory injunction to restrain you from using the end of Imperial Road, a public thoroughfare, for the purpose of erecting a Hospital thereon. Your Board gave an undertaking to the Court not to take more than 19 patients into 90 the Hospital (there were 17 in at the time of the motion), and you paid the costs of the motion. The action was taken on merely technical grounds as no possible injury could have been caused by the presence of these tents. The end of Imperial Road never having been used, being no more than an isolated piece of ground on the banks of the Thames. In consideration that the epidemic might still further increase your Committee passed a resolution to erect, if necessary, a temporary Hospital on the Little Wormwood Scrubbs. Directly your intention became known, an interlocutory injunction was applied for to the Court? of Chancery, by the Rev. Mr. Robinson and others, to restrain you from carrying out the proposal. Your Board opposed the motion which was refused by the Master of the Rolls, who at the same time expressed his opinion greatly in favour of the action you had taken. The epidemic having begun to decrease, it was not necessary to erect the hospital and the case eventually terminated by each side paying its own costs. It is worth recording, that on the 29th of April last year, there were, in other districts of the metropolis, 1,500 cases of small-pox left at home, spreading the disease without proper isolation, owing to the fact that there were no vacant beds at any of the Small-pox Hospitals, while in the Fulham district there was not, during the whole course of the epidemic, one single case that was not properly isolated owing to the want of Hospital accommodation. Mr. Dodson, M.P., President of the Local Government Board, himself visited the Tent Hospital which you erected. He expressed his opinion that the arrangements were admirable, and that great credit was due for the course that had been adopted. He afterwards stated in the House of Commons that he regretted the apathy of the other Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis in not providing Hospitals for the isolation of the large number of persons suffering from small-pox, who had been left at home to spread the disease. Fulham Small-pox Hospital. On December the 31st, 1880, there were but 15 cases of smallpox at the Metropolitan Asylum Small-pox Hospital. Altogether last year there were 1,952 admissions from 22 Unions, 1,790 were acute cases, 162 were convalescents from other hospitals, 38 of the cases admitted were not small-pox ; the number of admissions of persons suffering from small-pox was therefore 1,752. During the month of April 355 applications made by telegram were refused, owing to the fact that all of the 91 available beds were occupied. The total number of deaths from small-pox was 250, which equals a mortality rate of 14.3 per cent. Of the 250, 99 occurred amongst the vaccinated, 58 amongst the doubtful, and 93 amongst the unvaccinated. Of the total cases, 499 were transferred to Deptford Hospital, from whence they were takeen to the Convalescent Camp at Darenth. The per centage mortality on completed cases was I4.18. The mortality in those cases in which the patients had been once vaccinated was 7.30 ; in those in which it was doubtful if the patient had been once vaccinated, 31.01 percent.; and in those in which vaccination had never been performed successfully, 44.28 per cent. These facts, if all other facts were wanting, would be quite sufficient to prove the great utility of vaccination. The following table shows the number of acute cases of smallpox admitted into the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham, during the year 1881, also the number of cases vaccinated, doubtful, and unvaccinated, with the Unions from which they were admitted:— Parish or Union.

An interlocutory injunction has been obtained in the Court of Chancery, by a Mr. Chambers and others, restraining the Metropolitan Asylum Board from receiving cases of small-pox into this Hospital from any district lying beyond a mile radius of the Hospital. The interpretation that was put upon the meaning of the words of the injunction by the Counsel on both sides, is that no case was to be received into the Hospital from any house situated at a greater distance than one mile from the Hospital. This excludes cases from being removed there from some portions of this district. Your Board, after the injunction was granted, was obliged to send all those cases that occurred outside a mile radius of the Fulham Hospital to the Metropolitan Asylum Small-pox Hospital at Stockwell. At the end of last year the Metropolitan Asylum Board closed the Fulham Hospital, having come to the decision that it was not worth while to keep it open for the isolation of cases from so small a portion of the Metropolis. It is not necessary for me here to express my views on the question of the disease having been propagated to the inhabitants of Fulham from the Hospital, as your Board will shortly have the opportunity of reading my evidence which I have given on the subject before the Royal Hospitals Commission at the House of Commons. Scarlet Fever. During last year scarlet Fever was not so prevalent in London as in the previous year. There were 2,108 deaths registered against 3,073 in the year 1880. In the Fulham district there was a greater number of cases reported last year than in the year previous. The number of deaths registered last year was 65 against 37 the previous year. Altogether last year there were 228 cases reported, against 248, 180, and 152 reported in the three years 1878, 1879 and 1880. These numbers do not represent all the cases that occurred in the district, because a very large proportion are treated at home and never reported to your officers at all. Of the 228 cases reported last year there were 140 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 85 in the previous year, and 88 in the parish of Fulham, against 67 in the previous year. Information of 58 cases were first obtained in the death returns ; 92 cases were not reported till after the recovery of the patients. Two cases were too bad to be removed. In 29 cases the patients or their relatives refused to allow 93 moval. The accommodation, in many of these cases was not sufficient for the effectual isolation of the patients, but was not so bad that a magistrate's order could be obtained to enforce the removal. Forty patients were removed to hospitals and properly isolated ; 38 were taken by your Board, 37 to the Metropolitan Asylum Fever Hospital at Stockwell, one to the Islington Fever Hospital. Two cases were removed by the Fulham Board of Guardians to the Metropolitan Asylum Fever Hospital at Stockwell. In all of the cases reported a most careful system of disinfection was carried out by your Inspector. We may estimate, from the number of deaths registered, that there were about 1,300 persons attacked by the disease in this district last year, so when we consider that there were only 228 cases reported, it is not surprising that the disease continues to spread, notwithstanding the measures adopted by your Board. It is greatly to be hoped that an Act of Parliament will soon be passed requiring all these cases to be immediately reported to the sanitary authority of each district where they occur. Diphtheria. Of the 21 deaths from diphtheria, there were 10 in the parish of Fulham and 11 in the parish of Hammersmith, against five cases registered in the previous year, of which there were three in the parish of Fulham and two in the parish of Hammersmith. None of these cases were known of till after the death of the patients. In all these cases the sanitary condition of the dwellings in which the deceaseds had resided was strictly inquired into, but in most cases no cause of the outbreak was discoverable A large number of deaths that are registered as from diphtheria are from other causes, the throat affection being only a symptom of some other complaint. Whooping Cough. Only 39 deaths from whooping cough were registered last year, six in the parish of Fulham and 33 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 128 deaths registered during the previous year, of which there were 46 in the parish of Fulham and 82 in the parish of Hammersmith. It is curious to observe the comparative decrease in the number of deaths from this disease, not only in this district, but in the whole of London. There were only 1961 deaths from whooping cough in all London last year, against 3438 the previous year. The epidemic influence, which was so favourable to the prevalence of smallpox, seems to have 94 been unfavourable to the propagation of whooping cough, or at any rate, favourable to the recovery of those attacked. As I have frequently pointed out to you in my reports, little or no precaution is for a rule taken in the treatment of this disease to isolate the patients. Typhus Fever. The death registered as from typhus fever occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, against 3 registered in the previous year, of which there were 2 in the parish of Fulham and 1 in the parish of Hammersmith. The case which occurred last year was reported on the 24th of September, and the patient died the following day. There was no other case afterwards reported in this district. This case was probably imported from some other part of London, because the disease was very prevalent in certain districts of London at the time when this death occurred. Enteric or Typhoid Fever. There were 33 cases of typhoid fever reported last year, of which there were 13 in the parish of Fulham, and 20 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 7 cases registered the previous year, of which there were 3 in the parish of Fulham, and 4 in the parish of Hammersmith. Twenty-five of the cases reported last year, died. In most instances, the first information obtained of the case, was through the death returns. Six cases were treated at home, and 3 were removed to the Stockwell Fever Hospital, 2 by your Board, and 1 by the Fulham Board of Guardians. Although typhoid fever is not a very infectious disease, nevertheless it is highly desirable that a proper system of isolation should be carried out in the treatment of the complaint. In many cases it is highly dangerous that the patient should be removed a long distance ; it would, therefore, be of great advantage if each Local Sanitary Authority were to provide a small building under proper management, for the isolation of persons suffering from this very dangerous complaint. Measles. During last year, 63 deaths from measles were reported. Twenty-five in the parish of Fulham, and 38 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 99 cases reported in the previous year, of which there were 52 in the parish of Fulham, and 47 in the parish of Hammersmith. Besides the above deaths registered, there were a few cases of the disease heard of, but it was very exceptional that any information of a case was obtained unless the 95 patient succumbed to the disease. There can be no doubt that if a proper system of isolation was adopted in the treatment of this disease, a very large number of lives might be annually saved. There were in London alone no less a number than 2,533 deaths registered from measles last year, and this was by no means an exceptional year. Simple Continued Fever. There were 3 deaths registered from simple continued fever, all of which occurred in the parish of Hammersmith, against 3 registered the previous year, of which there was one in the parish of Fulham, and 2 in the parish of Hammersmith. All of these cases last year were reported in the death returns. As usual, the number of deaths from this disease was very small, much smaller than we might expect with so large a population. Diarrhoea. Of the 139 deaths from diarrhoea, there were 49 in the parish of Fulham, and 90 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 135 in the previous year, of which there were 63 in the parish of Fulham, and 72 in the parish of Hammersmith. Deaths from diarrhoea chiefly occur in the warm weather. They are attributable in many instances to improper feeding, and mostly take place among very young and very old or feeble persons. A very large number of deaths from this cause might be prevented, if more attention was paid to the quality of the food upon which young children are fed. English Cholera. No death was registered last year as occurring from English cholera. The previous year there were 4, of which there were 2 in the parish of Fulham and 2 in the parish of Hammersmith. Violent Deaths. There were 76 deaths from violence, of which there were 17 in the parish of Fulham and 59 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 84 in the previous year, of which there were 25 in the parish of Fulham and 59 in the parish of Hammersmith. The great difference in the numbers of these deaths in the 2 parishes is partly due to the fact of the difference in the numbers of 96 inhabitants, and partly to the existence in the parish of Hammersmith of a public hospital, a large number of persons suffering from accidents are taken to the West London Hospital from other districts, consequently the number of deaths registered from violence is greatly increased thereby. Inquests. There were 151 inquests held last year, of which there were 54 in the parish of Fulham and 97 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 167 the previous year. It is satisfactory to notice a slight decrease in the number of inquests held. Deaths in Public Institutions. There were 447 deaths registered as occurring at public institutions (of which there were 390 in the parish of Fulham and 57 in the parish of Hammersmith), against 221 the previous year, of which there were 171 in the parish of Fulham and 50 in the parish of Hammersmith. Of the 402 in the parish of Fulham 126 (males 57, females 69,) took place at the Fulham Union Workhouse; 258 (males 144, females 114,) at the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital ; and 6 (2 males and 4 females) at the Tent Hospital for Small-pox. Of the 57 in the parish of Hammersmith there were 56 (males 37, females 19,) in the West London Hospital; and one (a female) at the Wormwood Scrubs Convict Prison. Piggeries. Very little was done last year in the direction of removing the remaining piggeries from the district. In the second and third quarters of the year proceedings were taken against a pig keeper for disobeying a magistrate's order, prohibiting him from keeping swine on his premises, situated in Normand Lane, in the parish of Fulham. He was fined £1 and had to pay £2 5s. costs, after which he again disobeyed the order and was again fined one shilling and was ordered to pay five guineas costs. Several other summonses were taken out in reference to places where swine were kept, and in all instances but one the learned magistrate made orders prohibiting swine from being kept upon the premises. Many hundreds of pigs are still kept in the locality of Latymer Road. This part of the district is totally unfit for the purpose of pig feeding, and a most serious nuisance, injurious to public 97 health, is produced by their presence. The year before last your Board took legal proceedings with the view of abolishing the nuisance, but owing to the fact that the inhabitants failed to give evidence the proceedings were not successful. It is greatly to be regretted that this nuisance still exists, but your Board can take no action until the inhabitants of the locality are willing to give evidence in support of your proceedings. The question as to the desirability of your commencing fresh proceedings against the pig keepers is at present referred to me for consideration and report. Licensed Cow Houses. The licensed cow houses were kept under regular inspection during last year. A great improvement has taken place in the sanitary condition of most of them. In a few cases it was deemed to be necessary to oppose the applications for the renewal of licenses before the magistrates. In October at the Kensington Sessions, the Bench adjourned the hearing of the applications, and before the next meeting the sanitary defects which then existed had been remedied. Licensed Slaughter Houses. The licensed slaughter houses were under regular inspection during the year, and they were found, with very few exceptions, to be well regulated in conformity with your requirements. In no case was it found to be necessary to oppose the application for the renewal of the license. Bakehouses. The whole of the bakehouses in the district were inspected. In a great many cases they were not found to be kept in a proper sanitary condition, and it was necessary to require the bakers, under legal notice, to remedy the defects. In no case was it necessary to do more than serve a notice under the Nuisance Removal Act, for in each instance the notice was at once complied with. Sanitary Work. I have to report that improvement has taken place in the manner in which the several inspectors have performed their duties during the past year. I beg particularly to mention the 98 energy which Inspector Marsh displayed in dealing with the small-pox epidemic. A large number of cases of small-pox were, without doubt, prevented by the zeal with which he carried out my instructions. During the great pressure of work when the epidemic was at its worst, this inspector worked night and day without any rest. I found Inspectors Chamberlen and Croucher willing also to go out of their way to carry out my instructions, and they performed their duties generally to my satisfaction. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. District of Fulham, Capstone House, Hammersmith.
