Since the annual Report for 1895 the figures of the Metropolitan Census, taken at the commencement of April, 1896, under the Equalization of Rates Act, have appeared. It is much to be regretted that no provision was made in the Act for recording ages at this Census enumeration, as ages are of as much value in vital statistics as gross numbers. This omission narrows attention solely to numbers at all ages, and for the purpose of comparing the changes that have taken place in the distribution of population, the following table has been compiled. Populatitm— All Ages, Regent's Park. Tottenham Court Rd. Gray's Inn Lane. Somers Town. Camden Town. Kentish Town. St. Pancras. Changes.

But if, instead of taking the changes in the last fifteen years in one sum, they be taken separately, it appears that, whereas between 1881 and 1891 there was a diminution in the population of each of the sub-districts except Kentish Town, between' 1891 and 1896 there was an increase in the population of every one of the subdistricts except Somers Town, and the total population of St. Pancras was diminished by 1,879 persons between 1881 and 1891, and increased by 6,385 between 1891 and 1896, so that now it amounts to 240,764 inhabitants. In considering the changes in detail it is desirable to take each sub-district separately, and to bear in mind the causes contributing to the fluctuation of population, apart from the natural increase or decrease due to births and deaths. The population may be (A.) increased in a given area by (1) the construction of new dwellings on previously vacant land, (2) the reconstruction or extension of dwelling houses with greater accommodation (3) immigration into the district or sub-district, and consequent aggregation, and the occupation of fewer rooms or less space per head or per family; and, it may be (B) decreased in the area by (1) the demolition of dwellings, (2) the displacement of dwellings by workshops, &c., (3) emigration from the district or sub-district, and consequent segregation, and the occupation of more room or rooms per head. 13 The Table below shows the number of Inhabited Houses in each of the sub-districts, and in St. Pancras, at the Census periods of 18S1 and 1891. Unfortunately the Census Returns, under the Equalization of Rates Act, for 1896, did not include the number of houses:— Inhabited Houses. Regent's Park. Tottenham Court Road. Gray's Inn Lane. Somers Town. Camden Town. Kentish Town. St. Pancras. Changes. Census 1881 4378 2420 2956 3202 1692 10057 24705 Difference —192 —86 —236 —260 —215 +727 —252 —989 (all but one + 727 (K.T. only) Census, 1891 4186 2331 2720 2942 1477 10784 24413 Regent's Park. —In this sub-district, due to the extension of the London and North-Western Railway Company's premises, the houses in Cardington Street were found vacated at the Census of 1891, and they were subsequently demolished. Fitzroy Row and also some of the houses in Fitzroy Place were closed, have since been demolished, and factories and workshops constructed in their place. Also, just before 1891 demolitions for a considerable extension of the Seaton Street Board School took place, and a large site was cleared of dwellings to make room for the electric lighting station in Stanhope Street. These changes will account for the diminution of population at the Census of 1891. The increase at the 1896 Census may be due to reconstructions with increased accommodation. It is probable that the population will now for some years remain more or less stationary. Tottenham Court.—In this sub-district, between 1881 and 1891, there appears to have been proceeding a diminution of population, probably caused by the displacement of dwellings by shops, workshops, &c. But since 1891 this tide appears to have been receding. Grays Inn Lane.—The Census of 1891 found a large number of houses in the area just north of Cromer Street, in this sub-district, demolished, and new model blocks of dwellings in course of erection; the Colonnade and other places had also been demolished. This would account for the large diminution in the population at this Census enumeration. The large increase at the 1896 Census would be accounted for by the completion and occupation of the new blocks of dwellings, assisted by the opening, at the beginning of the year, of the new building, Rowton House, in King's Cross Road. Somers Town.—At the Census of 1891 a great number of houses in this subdistrict had already been vacated to make room for the extension of the Midland Railway Depots, and the Polygon had also been vacated for the purpose of demolition. The reconstruction on the latter site in Clarendon Square, and the occupation of the new blocks of buildings there, whilst stemming the tide of decrease of population, did not altogether counterbalance the continued diminution of numbers caused by the further closing and 14 demolition of houses on the Midland Depot site, north of Phoenix Street, that has been proceeding since 1891. As these demolitions were all completed before the Census of 1896, no further decrease can result from them at present. Camden Town.—The diminution of population in this district is partly due to the fact that demolition and reconstruction were going on at the Workhouse over a long period of time. The number of inmates in 1881 was 1,743 in 1891 it was 1,462, and in 1896 it is 2,008. So that one-sixth of the decrease in the first, and one-third of the increase in the second intercensal period was due to the-e causes. The Census of 1891 also found a large number of houses between Camden Street and College Place demolished, and on their sites new houses have been erected, and were found fully occupied at the Census of 1896. Kentish Town.— In this sub-district building has been steadily going on for years, so that the population is equally steadily increasing. There are still considerable vacant areas in the north of this district, that doubtless will sooner or later be built upon ; in the meantime a few new dwelling houses are being erected and occupied. As to the future estimates of population.—It was not correct to assume that because the population in every sub-district, except Kentish Town, decreased between 1881 and 1891, that therefore it would decrease also between 1891 and 1896. As a matter of fact it did not decrease, but increased in every sub-district except Somers Town. On the other hand, it would not be correct to assume that because the population increased in every sub-district, except Somers Town, between 1891 and 1896, that therefore it will increase in the same ratio between the Census of 1896 and the Census of 1901, since we know that most of the last increases are due to the replenishing of the vacancies of the previous decrease. In the more central parts of the district many dwelling roooms and houses tend to become partly or wholly workshops and workplaces, and so to reduce the resident population. On the other hand, the tendency is for houses in these central parts of the district to be demolished and rebuilt in flats or blocks of dwellings, and thus to increase the resident population—that is to say, with the natural inclination of the populatiou to diminish in the more central parts, there has also sprung up in recent years the counteracting tendency to increase the number of dwellings and accommodation in houses rebuilding. The result is that the change of population in the more central parts may be expected to be small and less necessary to take into account so that, in spite of the change in the last quinquennium, it will be desirable to regard the population of each of the sub-districts as approximately stationary, excepting that of Kentish Town. The Registrar General's logarithmic method of calculation appears to be inapplicable to St. Pancras. For instance, calculated by this method, based upon the decrease between the Census of 1881 and 1891, the population of St. Pancras at the Census of 1896 would have been 233,445, instead of 240,764. The population at the Census of 1901, based upon the increase between 1891 and 1896 gives an estimate of 253,476, obviously too high. If the changes 15 of the last fifteen years be regarded, and the Census of 1881 and 1896 be be taken as bases, the estimate for the Census of 1901 works out at 242,285, a more probable number. As it does not seem possible for the population of St. Pancras and subdistricts to increase or diminish at a compound rate of interest, but rather to vary in a simple arithmetical manner, the use of logarithms appears to be too refined, and to lead to fallacious estimates. It is more desirable to assume the simpler method of arithmetical variation. Assuming that only the population of the Kentish Town sub-district is varying, and increases in the same proportion as between the Census of 1891, and that of 1896, namely, by 2,645 persons, it follows that arithmetically this represents an annual increase to the Kentish Town and the St. Pancras population of 529, this again represents an increase of 132 persons quarterly, and makes the population in the middle of 1896 in St. Pancras 240,896, and in Kentish Town 98,542. To these figures must also be added the population of certain institutions beyond St. Pancras, as the deaths of the residents in those institutions are included in the statistics of St. Pancras, and this extra parochial population must be distributed pro rata, and added to the population of the several subdistricts, as in the following tables:— Residents Outside St. Pancras.

In order to show this, and to show the corrected deathrates the following Table has been prepared, in which will be seen a 16 considerable modification in the incidence of mortality, and it will be noted that the death-rate of St. Pancras instead of being 20'3 per mille in the year 1895, was really 19.8,—exactly the same rate as for the whole of London.

The population of St. Pancras is regarded as stationary. The figures of the 1896 Census have been taken as a basis, and the 2138 inmates of ExtraParochial Institutions have been added to the sub-districts in proportion to the population. The deaths amongst these inmates are included in the statistics of the year.

The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during the year was 2226, being 17 less than in the previous year, and 102 more than the annual average of the previous ten years. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year was 7042, being 57 less than in the preceding year, and 139 less than the annual average during the preceding decennium. 17 The 207 births in public institutions having been re-distributed according to population, the number of births and the birth-rate of each of the SubDistricts, and of the District, were as follows:— Sub-Districts.

If calculated on a population of 242,764, then 4856 deaths would represent an annual death-rate of 20.00 per thousand living. 18 DEATHS. During the year 1896, the corrected total number of deaths from all causes at all ages was 4460,being 334 less than during the preceding year,and 396 below the annual 'average of the preceding ten years. Per 1000 of the population the death-rate was 18.3, compared with 20"3 in the previous year, and an annual average of 20.3 in the preceding decennium. The total number of deaths and the death-rates in the Sub-Districts are set out below, 176 deaths from all causes not referable to any particular SubDistricts being distributed according to population:— Sub-Districts.

In comparing the mortality of the Sub-Districts, it will be seen that in the Somers Town Sub-District occurred the highest general death-rate, the highest death-rate of infants under one year per 1000 births, the highest death-rate of children under five years per 1,000 births, the highest death-rate from bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy, and from the notifiable infectious diseases, as well as the second highest from the principal zymotic diseases. The Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District stood highest as to death-rates from the principal zymotic diseases, and from phthisis. On the other hand, in the Kentish Town Sub-District are shown the lowest death-rates from general causes, from phthisis, and also from bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy, and the lowest death-rates of infants under one year, and children under five years per 1,000 births. The Tottenham Court Sub-District contributed the lowest death-rates from the notifiable infectious diseases and the principal zymotic diseases. III.—INFECTIOUS DISEASES. NOTIFICATIONS.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. The diagnosis of diphtheria is often difficult and leads to differences of opinion as between medical practitioners themselves and their patients. Mild and doubtful cases are a source of great danger as carriers of infection, and in young children are a ready means of spreading the disease in schools. 26 In the diagnosis of typhoid fever there is also frequent difficulty, and nearly always long delay. In these circumstances your Vestry sanctioned the submission of specimens of secretion in doubtful diphtheria cases, and of blood in doubtful typhoid cases to bacteriological examination at a maximum cost of 3s. 6d. per case. Some of the difficulties attending the working of the clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, referring to notification, isolation, and disinfection in infectious diseases will be overcome by this procedure, for the purpose of which a system has been organised and is now at work. A tin case or diagnosis box containing an outfit has been sent to every medical practitioner in the District. The box has two compartments, one holding a sterilised test-tube containing a swab on a stem, the other holding a test-tube containing two sterilized and plugged capillary tubes; both testtubes are closed with cotton wool stoppers and packed in cotton wool. In the top of the cover of the diagnosis box is permanently fixed an information notice to the following effect:— Information Notice.—Diagnosis Box, No. Every Medical Practitioner is supplied with a Diagnosis Box containing two sterilised tubes fitted. When charged, in accordance with the directions (enclosed herewith), the Diagnosis Box, with the Identification Form (enclosed herewith) duly filled in, should be forthwith sent to the Medical Officer of Health, in the stamped and addressed envelope (enclosed herewith); and an uncharged Diagnosis Box, with addressed envelope, Identification Form, Directions, &c., enclosed, will be transmitted by return. A report of the bacteriological examination will be communicated as soon as possible to the Medical Practitioner, and no charge made. Inside the cover of the Diagnosis Box, which keeps it in place when shut, is loosely laid an Identification Form to the following effect:— Identification Form. No. of Diagnosis Box Date Medical Practitioner Patient Name Address Name Sex Age Address Disease Suspected On the lid of the box is scratched—St. Pancras, and the number of the box, and the same number is also filled into the Information Notice and Identification Form. The Diagnosis Box is then closed and wrapped in the two following Forms:— Directions as to Diphtheria. In the Diagnosis Box the sterilised cork tube is for membrane and secretion. It is advisable to send membrane as well as secretion, where possible, and they should be obtained before the application of local remedies, if possible. If 27 the Diagnosis Box be received before 3 p.m. at the Health Department, Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, N. W., a Report of the bacteriological examination will be communicated within twenty-four hours (holidays and holy-days excepted). Note.—The nearest place where Diphtheria Antitoxin can be obtained is the British Institute of Preventive Medicine, 101, Great Russell Street, W.C. Directions as to Enteric or Typhoid Fever. In the Diagnosis Box the plugged tube containing two sterilised pipettes is for liquid blood. The best method of obtaining it is to thoroughly cleanse and dry the top of a finger of the patient, to bind the finger from the second to the third knuckle joint, and to prick the tense skiu with a large needle so as to cause a large bead of blood to collect. Then to break off the tiny ballpoint and dip the pipette into the blood, remove the cotton wool plug from the stem, and suck up into the bulb two or three drops of blood. Finally, to break off the stem, and carefully and slowly seal in a flame both the ends left projecting from the bulb. These ends should be as long as possible, the dry end should be sealed first, and, in sealing the ends, should just touch the edge of the flame. If the Diagnosis Box be received before 3 p.m. at the Health Department, Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, N.W., a Report of the bacteriological examination will be communicated within twenty-four hours (holidays and holy-days excepted). The package is then wrapped round with special-shaped envelope, addressed "immediate, The Medical Officer of Health, Yestry Hall, Pancras Road, London, N. W," and inserted into a special-shaped envelope for delivery to the medical practitioner. The charged boxes are forwarded every afternoon about four p.m. to the British Institute of Preventive Medicine, and as soon as the Report is received next day from that Institution the result is immediately forwarded to the medical practitioner.

Previous to this recent rise in the mortality, the increased prevalence of diphtheria appeared as a displacement of other existing throat diseases; but the recent rise has proceeded far beyond that point, and this is seen clearly in the column of mortality from all diseases of the throat in which the number in London is seen almost to double in (he year 189'J. DIPHTHERIA NOMENCLATURE. At various times difficulties have been experienced in obtaining the removal to hospital of cases of diphtheria, or its congeners. In order to settle a question as to nomenclature, a letter was addressed to the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and by that Board the question was submitted to the Local Government Hoard. As the matter is important, the letter to the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the reply of the Local Government Board are set out below. They are self-explanatory. Vestry Hall, Pancras Road, n.w., 31stf December, 1896. T. Duncombe Mann, Esq., Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, Strand, W.C. Dear Sir, Diphtheria—Membranous Croup. At various times when your Board has been asked to remove to hospital cases of Membranous Croup, return enquiries have been made as to whether the cases have been Diphtheritic in character, and I have been informed, through the telephone, that your Board declines to remove cases of Membranous Croup. Referring to the third edition of the "Nomenclature of Diseases," published by the Royal College of Physicians, London, 1896, I find in the list of diseases, and numbered 14, Diphtheria—variety: Laryngeal Diphtheria. Synonym : Membranous Croup. It is obvious that, in the.opinion of the Royal College of Physicians, Membranous Croup is Diphtheria of the Larynx. I would ask you, therefore, to kindly inform me whether since the publication of the above " Nomenclature " your Board admits Membranous Croup (unqualified) to your hospitals, and I should esteem your answer the more, as a solution to this question is extremely important in working the infectious diseases notification section of the Publio Health (London) Act. Yours faithfully, JOHN F. J. SYKES. 31 Local Government Board, Whitehall, 2oth March, 1897. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 19th January, enquiring whether, having regard to the fact, that in the 3rd edition of " Nomenclature of Diseases recently published by the Royal College of Physcians, 'Membranous Croup' is stated to be a synonym for 'Laryngeal Diphtheria,' the Board considers that patients certified as suffering from ' Membranous Croup ' without qualification, may properly be admitted into the hospitals belonging to the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District. I am directed in reply, to inform the Managers that the Board are advised that the term "Membranous Croup" per se is not sufficiently definite, inasmuch as membranous inflammation of the larynx may arise from causes other than diphtheria. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. E. Knollys, Assistant Secretary. T. D. Mann, Esq., Clerk to the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, Norfolk Street, W.C. DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN. The Report of the Medical Superintendents upon the use of antitoxic serum in the treatment of diphtheria in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board during the year 1896, draws the conclusion that the improved results in the diphtheria cases treated during the year are due to :— (t.) A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first three days of illness. (it.) The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. (in.) The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. (iv.) The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate hospital. (iv.) The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. Great stress is laid upon "the paramount importance of commencing the treatment early "—if possible, not later than the second day of the disease. The opinion is again expressed that antitoxic serum is a remedy of much greater value in the treatment of diphtheria than any other known. 32 ISOLATION.

The Grove Hospital, at Tooting, for 520 „ 1068 „ "The Board have also secured a site for a Convalescent Hospital at Carshalton, on which they propose to provide for 700 convalescent fever and diphtheria patients. " It is anticipated that the Park Hospital will be opened about next July, and the Grove Hospital sometime in 1898. "For Small-pox patients, the existing accommodation is as follows :— Hospital Ships 300 Gore Farm Upper Hospital 1000 (At present occupied by Scarlet Fever patients.) Gore Farm, Lower Hospital 192 (Wooden buildings). 1492 "Joyce Green Estate.—On this estate the managers proposed to provide beds for 940 patients, but the Local Government Board have refused to sanction provision being made for more than 400 patients " (for small-pox). N. W. AMBULANCE STATION. A communication recently addressed to the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board elicited satisfactory information as to the progress of the Ambulance Station at the North-Western Fever Hospital in the Fleet Road : — "The North-Western Ambulance Station will probably be opened for work about the beginning of July next. "Its operations, at first, will not extend beyond the four or five contiguous Parishes ; but in settling the accommodation for staff, horses, and carriages, the possibilities of future developments have been considered. "At the main entrance from Lawn Road are quarters for eight nurses engaged on Small-pox Ambulance duty. These quarters, it is hoped, will rarely be occupied; but in the event of an epidemic of Small-pox they will be of great service, as it is, of course, undesirable to lodge nurses engaged on Small-pox work with those employed in the adjoining Fever Hospital. "Then come, on the right hand side of the yard, the Superintendent's quarters, the female domestic servants' quarters, the laundry and stores. 34 "After passing an emergency exit to the Fleet Road, the stables for eighteen horses are reached, and in the same block are forage stores, lamp room, harness rooms, &c. "On the left hand side of the main entrance are the quarters for a staff of eighteen men with mess-room, lavatories, equipuaent-room, &c., and ooachhouses for eighteen ambulances, two omnibuses, and one cab. "At the end of the yard are the wheelwrights' and smiths' shops, stores for paint, &c." DISINFECTION.

The Report embodied the result of enquiries addressed to 42 London, 32 Provincial, 4 Scottish, and 2 Irish Sanitary Authorities, and concluded with reference to St. Pancras. The St. Pancras Shelter was erected in 1S93 over the coach-houses and stores on the south-west side of the Disinfecting Station. It consists of four separate rooms, each containing a complete cooking range and a sink and draw-taps, also a complete set of cooking, eating and drinking utensils. To each room is attached a bath-room and lavatory, supplied with hot and cold water. The occupants are supplied with towels dressing-gowns, and slippers as required during bathing and the disinfection of their clothing. The four rooms have a respective capacity of 2,500, 1,000, 1,000, and 1,400 cubic feet, and open into a corridor provided with two w.c.'s, fitted with modern apparatus. The Shelter is made known by a paragraph upon the rate papers, and also by a paragraph upon the notices sent from the Health Department to each case of infectious disease, after the notification certificate is received. The later paragraph is to this effect:— " The members of any family compelled to leave their dwelling for the purpose of enabling it to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority will be accommodated, free of charge, during the day, in the Family Shelter in Cambridge Street, on the east side of and overlooking the St. Pancras Gardens. The Shelter is fitted with every convenience for use and provided with the necessary attendance. In order to prevent riding in public vehicles, a conveyance will be sent to the house to drive the family to the Shelter, if a request is made." 36 The Sanitary Inspectors hare instructions, when making their enquiries, to advise persons to use the Shelter in appropriate cases. The Disinfectors have also been instructed to recommend the Shelter to those requiring temporary accommodation, and to offer to drive those to it who are willing to go. The following suggestions were submitted for the consideration of your Health Committee : — 1.—The provision of sleeping accommodation would be a great advantage. At present the stripping and cleansing of a room seldom takes place on the same day as the fumigation—generally it is the next day, and sometimes the day after. The reason for this is that twenty-four hours' notice is by law required before entering to strip and cleanse, and even if it were possible to serve the notice earlier in some cases, it is impossible to do so in those cases that are notified as infectious and removed to hospital the same day. Under these conditions the provision of sleeping accommodation would probably prove attractive by enabling occupiers to shelter, not only during the fumigation, but also during the stripping and cleansing. 2.—The provision of increased comfort at the Shelter in the form of carpats, curtains, &c., and as these can be disinfected in the chamber close by, after each time of using, no risk would be incurred. 3.—Payment of the Caretaker according to results, so as to encourage the taking of the extra trouble necessary to ensure families being informed of, and conveyed to, the Shelter. Before coming to any conclusion, your Committee was recommended to visit and view the Shelters provided by some of the London Authorities—namely, those of Islington, in the Seven Sisters' Road ; Marylebone, in Grove Road near Capland Street; Paddington, in Harrow Road, opposite the Vestry Hall; St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, in Horseferry Road. Your Committee found that it was usual to provide sleeping accommodation in some Temporary Shelters, and that the stripping and cleansing, being part of the process of disinfection, legally required accommodation to be provided whilst being carried out, and that this necessitated sleeping. After viewing the Shelters, they also decided that the provision of sleeping accommodation at the Family Shelter provided by the Vestry of Saint Pancras would be a great advantage, inasmuch as it would prove more attractive and provide greater comfort. Accordingly your Vestry resolved in January last (a) that the North-west South-east rooms of the Family Shelter in Cambridge Street, Saint Pancras, be furnished appropriately as bedrooms, and that a list of the furniture and articles required be prepared, and estimates obtained for the consideration of the Committee ; (b) that in addition to the remuneration at present paid to the Caretaker for cleansing and taking charge of the Family Shelter (namely, five shillings weekly), a sum of two shillings and sixpence be paid to her in addition for attending upon each family sleeping at the Shelter, and a sum of one shilling for each family attending at the Shelter, but not sleeping thereat.

On the 25th June, 1896, the Delegates appointed by the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, upon the invitation of your Vestry, met in Conference at the Vestry Hall of St. Pancras to consider the administration of the Vaccination Acts, and the question of the transfer of the control of vaccination from Poor Law Authorities to Sanitary Authorities. Attention was directed to the serious local epidemics of Small-pox that had occurred in varionr parts of the country, and to the difficulties that had arisen in each of these outbreaks, due to the division of authority between the Sanitary Authorities and the Poor Law Guardians in the prevention of the spread of Small-pox. It was concluded that the various means for coping with the disease and the prevention of its spread should be in the hands of one Authority, and this for many reasons which were adduced. The question whether vacciuation should be compulsory or not was not touched upon; this point was left to the Royal Commission to report upon. It does not affect the control of vaccination, for, whether compulsory or not, all sensible people will still continue to be vaccinated, and public vacci nation will continue to require to be organised. Vaccination is a measure for the prevention of disease and not for the cure of disease. Sanitary Authorities deal with the prevention of disease; Guardian Boards, when they deal with disease, deal with the cure of disease. Sanitary Authorities deal with protection of the whole community—rich and poor alike—from disease, and especially communicable disease. Boards of Guardians deal with the treatment only of the absolutely indigent. The connection of pauperism with vaccination has been its greatest bane, from the fear of the loss of civil rights and of self-respecting independence. The transfer of vaccination from Boards of Guardians to Sanitary Authorities would place the whole machinery of the prevention of Small-pox in one organization, the relative parts of which could be mutually adapted to suppress smoothly and expeditiously any appearance of epidemic. If vaccination were in the hands of Sanitary Authorities it would obviate much misunderstanding, especially at the most serious and important time of an outbreak of Small-pox, when the means of prevention being in the hands of two Authorities in the same locality leads to much confusion, counter proposal, and delay. When there is no epidemic a division of authority is not felt, but in time, of epidemic the hour of trial comes, the difficulties arise, and in every epidemic there have invariably been serious delay and confusion of responsibility at the very time when smoothness and rapidity of working is most essential. 40 It has been stated that Sanitary Authorities and Boards of Guardians consist in many places of almost the same members. This is, to a certain extent, true ; but the members who sit on these Bodies are always careful to confine their duties within the scope of their powers; and even if they desired to go beyond them, the Clerk of the Body would quickly check any such illegal action. So that the prevention of Small-pox is and always must remain divided so long as one part is in the hands of one Authority, and another part of another, and courtesy frequently prevents one Board from criticising, advising, or stimulating another Board, the effect of which is not beneficial to smooth working of what should be one homogenous system of prevention. Vaccination means and methods could be immensely improved, and the opposition to it mitigated, if not entirely removed, but no improvement has taken or is likely to take place, so long as it is administered only for paupers, and the general public has to submit to a pauper system. Guardian Boards have no special Officer to report upon such a subject as the prevalence and prevention of Small-pox in the community, and even if the)had, the Officer would not be in possession of sufficient information upon the subject. It must be obvious that, however conscientious a Board of Guardians may be, they cannot possibly be so well acquainted with the requirements to prevent or meet an epidemic as the Sanitary Authority; but Boards of Guardians necessarily differ in conscientiousness. It has happened over and over again that Sanitary Authorities have found it necessary to remind Boards of Guardians of their responsibilities and duties with regard to vaccination (see also Lancet, May 2nd, 1896, p. 240). The Public Health Committee of the Ipswich Corporation in the last week of April, 1896, alarmed at the neglect of vaccination in the Borough, drew the serious attention of the Board of Guardians to the risk being incurred. In Gloucester, in April, 1896, the Town Council found it necessary to remind the Board of Guardians that they were not by any means doing sufficient vaccination to stay the Small-pox epidemic, and engaged a dozen medical men to make house-to-house visitation and vaccination throughout the City. In Warrington, during the epidemic of Small-pox in 1892-3, the Health Committee had to take up the duty legally devolving upon the Board of Guardians and to open five extra vaccination stations and provide extra vaccinators. The responsibility, not only for stemming an immediate epidemic, but also for preventing a future epidemic, should be placed upon the Sanitary Authority. Accusations, on the one hand, that it is due to the insufficient provision of hospital accommodation, and, on the other, that it is due to insufficient vaccination, could not then be made by one public body against another. Sanitary Authorities have notified to them all cases of Small-pox, and consequently are immediately acquainted with the extent and locality of outbreaks, and know when and where vaccination is most urgent. 41 Every Sanitary Authority has an Officer specially trained in the prevention as distinguished from the cure of disease, who is kept informed every moment of the prevalence of disease. In case of an outbreak of Small-pox, it falls upon the Sanitary Authority to receive the notifications, to provide for isolation and for disinfection, and in short to undertake the whole duty of combatting the disease ; and in case of inability to cope with it, the odium also falls upon the Sanitary Authority. The transfer of the control of vaccination should make no difference in the cost, as the same Officers would carry out the work ; but it would make a vast improvement in the administration, especially when under pressure, on account of the administration for the prevention of Small-pox being in the hands of one public body only and worked as part of one public department in possession of such knowledge as to enable the staff and resources to be applied in the most effectual manner and to the fullest extent available. It has been said that some Sanitary Authorities would do even less than some Guardian Boards in the matter. This is extremely unlikely, because any failure to prevent an outbreak of Small-pox would expose the members of a Sanitary Authority to considerable odium, especially as they will have been constantly advised by an expert Officer to keep the vaccination up to date. It has been said that Sanitary Authorities are unfit bodies to have control of vaccination. It may be true that some of the smaller Sanitary Authorities are not sufficiently alive to the prevention of diseases, but this does not apply to the larger Authorities, and especially to the Boroughs and County Boroughs, many of which have obtained private Acts far in advance of the general legislation of the country or the knowledge of the bulk of our legislators. It has been recommended that vaccination should be placed in the hands of a Central Authority. It is now in the hands of a Central Authority, the Local Government Board, which Board controls the administration of the Acts by the Boards of Guardians in the Poor Law Unions, and would equally control it if it were transferred to the Sanitary Authorities. Money invested, not only in vaccination, but also in re-vaccination, is well invested, and often saves thousands of pounds from being spent subsequently by Sanitary Authorities in hospital provision and other measures to meet epidemics. It was resolved that in the opinion of the Conference of delegates of the Metropolitan Vestries and District tBoards, the Vaccination Acts should be administered by the Authorities that administer the Acts and provisions for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases by notification, isolation, and disinfection. It was further resolved that a Deputation from the Conference, to consist of two Delegates from each Vestry and District Board represented, be appointed to wait upon the President of the Local Government Board to urge (a) the desirableness of the administration of the Vaccination Acts being 42 placed in the hands of the Sanitary Authorities, and (b) the urgent necessity for the Royal Commission on Vaccination reporting at as early a date as possible. A communication was addressed to the Local Government Board embodying the foregoing Resolutions, and on 2nd September, 1896, a letter was received, in reply, stating that the Board did not see that any advantage would arise from the attendance of the proposed Deputation as to the administration of the Vaccination Acts, until the Board have had an opportunity of considering the Report of the Royal Commission. Since then the Sixth and final Report of the Royal Commission on Vaccination has been issued, and paragraph 508 of the Report expresses the following opinion : — " 508.—In connection with the subject with which we have been dealing, we may advert to the suggestion that the Vaccination and tho Sanitary Authority should in all cases be identical, " It has been pointed out that, whilst the isolation of patients in hospitals and otherwise is provided for by the Sanitary Authority, the extent of the provision requisite to deal with the outbreak of Small-pox may depend upon the degree in which the Vaccination Laws have been enforced. " More hospital accommodation may be required when vaccination has been neglected than when the Vaccination Laws have been complied with. " It is contended that sanitation and vaccination, concerning, as they both do, the health of the people, should be under the jurisdiction of a single Authority, and the Sanitary Authority is the appropriate one for the purpose. Indeed, the advantage of placing in the same hands the supervision of vaccination, and of the other measures designed to prevent the spread of disease, are so great and so obvious that the proposal to do so deserves most serious consideration. Under present arrangements, however, such a proposal raises very great difficulties. Whilst in England and Wales there are only 648 Vaccination Authorities, the Sanitary Authorities exceed 1,700 in number. Moreover, whereas in some cases a Borough, the Council of which is the Sanitary Authority, comprises parts of several Unions, in other cases a single Union contains within it many Sanitary Authorities. For example, the Borough of Bristol includes the whole of one Union and parts of two other Unions. On the other hand, the Huddersfield and Halifax Unions contain no less than 25 and 19 Urban Sanitary Districts respectively. Many other instances might be cited to show that, it would be impracticable to vest the sanitary and vaccination duties in all cases in a single Local Authority without a complete recasting of our present areas of local administration. "We are not in a position to devise a scheme which would accomplish, either wholly or partially, the desired result. At the same time we fully recognise the importance of achieving it, as far as possible, and we should regard with favour such changes as would render the amalgamation of the Vaccinatiou and Sanitary Authorities feasible ; or, indeed, any steps taken in that direction, even although they should only partially effect the object in view." 43 With regard to improvements in the law as to Vaccination there are certain that are, above all others, very important: — 1.—To fix a standard of primary vaccination of at least four separate marks, and an area of at least half a square inch of vaccinated surface or cicatrix. 2.—To require that all certificates of primary vaccination should state the number of successful marks and the area covered by the vaccination surface. 3.—To provide that no certificate of primary vaccination should .be accepted as a successful certificate unless conforming; to this standard, and to provide for dealing with unsuccessful certificates and cases. 4.—To give the vaccinifer the option of having calf lymph. 5.—To provide for the gratuitous supply of calf lymph to every vaccinator. 6.—To provide for re-vaccination between the ages of 10 and 12 years, and at any future periods of life, and during epidemics. One other paragraph from the Report of the Royal Commission may be quoted— " 503.—We can see nothing, then, to warrant the conclusion that in this country vaccination might be safely abandoned and replaced by a system of isolation. If such a change wero made in our method of dealing with smallpox, and that which had been substituted proved ineffectual to prevent the spread of the disease (it is not suggested that it could diminish its severity in those attacked), it is impossible to contemplate the consequences without dismay. " To avoid misunderstanding, it may be well to repeat that we are very far from underrating the value of a system of isolation. We have already dwelt upon its importance. But what it can accomplish as an auxiliary to vaccination is one thing, whether it can be relied on in its stead is quite another thing." IV.—SANITATION. Inspections.—The following were the number of inspections and re-inspections made by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year:— Parliamentary Sub-Divisions. Inspections. Re-Inspections. Totals.

Mr. Shill has, since the close of the year, resigned. The two Sanitary Inspectors of Workshops, appointed at the end of 1895, did satisfactory work during the past year. Mr. Barth has been engaged in inspecting workshops, bakehouses, factories, in attending to stnoke nuisances, and in temporary additional duties. The books kept have been a Diary, a Register of Workshops, and a Register of Bakehouses, and certain forms and notices. During the past year the Inspector made 3022 inspections and 1677 re-inspections. In the Workshops Register a large number of workshops employing male labour were entered, but they represent only a small portion of the number in the whole parish, and include only the area south of Euston Road, excluding Euston Road itself, aud Tottenham Court Road. Except for the abatement of nuisances under notice, no re-inspections of the workshops entered in the Register have yet been made. The Bakehouse Register contains 200 bakehouses entered, being the total in the whole parish, and these were periodically visited each half-year. 45 A fexc Factories were visited, upon complaint, and the nuisanoes abated at them, but no systematic inspection of factories, as to sanitary conveniences, has yet been made. Smoke observations were kept upon a number of chimneys in the district discharging black smoke, complaints of which were made, and notices were served for the abatement. Temporary duties were also discharged by this Inspactor upon several occasions during the absence of District Inspectors, and particularly during the vacancy in the Somers Town District (ilr. Shill), and during the vacation. Mr. Barth's time is fully occupied with (a) the inspection of Workshops north of Euston Road; (b) the systematic inspection of Factories as to sanitary conveniences; (c) the periodical inspection of Bakehouses ; (d) the observation of smoke nuisances, and the compilation of a Smoke Register; and (e) temporary duties in connection with vacancies in the Districts of the other Inspectors during ill-health or vacation. Miss Thurgood has been engaged in inspecting workshops, laundries, and factories (as to sanitary conveniences) where women are employed. The book8 kept have been a Diary, a Register of Workshops, a Register of Bakehouses, and certain forms and notices. During the past year the Inspector made 3,203 inspections and 286 re-inspections, and inspected all the workshops and laundries in the District where women are employed. It has been regarded as desirable that workshops where ladies' attire of various kind is made, and such occupations as dress-making, millinery, costumiers, ladies' tailoring aud mantel making are carried on, should be inspected twice during the summer, which is the busy, and consequently the overcrowding season, in addition to once in the winter season. The laundries might also be inspected twice annually. It was considered desirable by your Health Committee that the sanitary arrangements and conveniences of shops where women are employed should be inspected annually ; and also infants' and girls' schools, especially those conducted privately, and that this might be done during the winter months. With reference to measles and puerperal fever, it was regarded by your Health Committee as undesirable to associate infectious diseases with the duties of the Inspectors of Workshops. OPEN SPACES. Public Open Spaces.—The parks, gardens, and other public open spaces secured against building operations in St. Pancras, together with their situation, 46 approximate area, and the authority under whioh they are maintained, are enumerated, as in previous years, in the following table:— Sub-Distriots.

There is a prospect that in course of time the whole of the open spaces about buildings may disappear. Plans are being submitted for the approval of the drainage of premises proposed to be newly erected or re-erected. These plans show the whole of the ground area of the premises entirely covered in, and upon consulting legal references it appears that more recent changes in the building laws permit this course to be adopted, a course, the ultimate result of which will be a most serious matter for the health of London. In the Metropolitan Building Act, 1855, by Section 29 it was provided that every building used or intended to be used as a dwelling-house, unless all the rooms can be lighted and ventilated from a street or alley adjoining, shall have in the rear, or on the side thereof, an open space exclusively belonging thereto of the extent, at least, of one hundred square feet. 47 In the Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment Act, 1882, by Section 14 it was provided that every new building on a new site, intended to be used wholly or partly as a dwelling-house, shall have directly attached, and in the rear, an open space exclusively belonging thereto of at least one hundred and fifty square feet, increasing according to the length of frontage to a maximum requirement of four hundred aud fifty square feet, but the open space was expressly permitted to be entirely covered in up to the level of the ceiling of the ground floor storey. In the London Building Act, 1894, although by Section 40 it is provided that a new domestic building, with a habitable basement, shall have an open space of not less than one hundred square feet (going back to the requirement of 18)5), and that it may be erected upon up to the level of the adjoining pavemenr, yet in a new domestic building abutting upon an old street, and this iucludes houses to be rebuilt—that is, it applies to all London Streets existing at the commencement of the Act in 1895, by Section 41 (2) the open space to be provided to the building may be entirely covered in up to a level of sixteen feet above the adjoining pavement, or in other words, no open space need be provided to the lowest floors, namely, the basement and ground floor, and possibly also an entresol of the house. Furthermore there is no requirement to provide any open space to public buildings, including schools, colleges, places of instruction, hospitals, workhouses, theatres, halls, public rooms, libraries, hotels, lodging-houses, homes, refuges, shelters of greater capacity than 250,000 cubic feet, or to buildings of the warehouse class, including factories and workshops of greater capacity than 150,000 cubic feet, nor in any buildings constructed to be principally used as offices although dwelling-houses. The open space required about buildings built as or adapted for artizans' dwellings is specially provided for in the Building Act, but this will not benefit those who live in ordinary domestic buildings, whether as householders, or subtenants, or lodgers occupying one or more rooms, and who are a large majority of the population. In consequence of this continuously retrogressive legislation old houses possessing yards, areas, open spaces in some form, at the front or back, or both, are being rebuilt in such a manner as to entirely cover the whole ground area two or three stories up, leaving not a particle of open space, not even a shaft for the purpose of allowing the drainage to discharge in the open, so that the health conditions of domestic buildings in London will rapidly become worse, and the bye-laws, regulations and directions of the County Council and the Sanitary Authorities, which are all devised so as to cause drainage to be excluded from or to be placed outside of, domestic buildings, are rendered useless by a Building Act which enables a domestic building to embrace the whole of the drainage of the premises within its external walls. The matter wears an even more serious aspect when considered on a wider basis. The words " open space," originally bore the common meauing of ground space, to most persons they still bear that common-sense meaning, and Parliament has attached that meaning to the words in the Open Spaces Acts. But in the later Building Acts the provision of open space has successively been lifted from the basement to the ground floor, thence over the first floor to sixteen feet above the ground level, and in due time may be made by future 48 Acta of Parliament to ascend higher, so that eventually a house may be held to have supplied the necessary open space on the roof top instead of at ground level. It is only by tracing the result to its logical conclusion, that the past, present and prospective perversion in the Buildings Act of the meaning of "open space " can be fully understood, and the seriousness of the position realised. DWELLINGS. House-to-house Inspections.—The number of streets inspected from houseto-house during the year was 6 ; consisting of 223 houses, 221 occupied, aud 5 unoccupied ; 1,843 rooms, 1,837 occupied, and 6 unoccupied ; containing 643 families, consisting of 1,759 adults, and 876 children under 10 years of age. Upon these houses 85 notices were served. Houses Occupied in Separate Dwellings. —These consist of (a) houses not constructed to be so occupied, and (b) of houses specially constructed to be so occupied. Houses specially constructed in separate dwellings may be so constructed that the dwellings are self-contained, as those in List I. in the Appendix, or may be constructed so that various appurtenances of the dwelling are used in common. This is pursued further under the head of Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, provisions as to inhabited house duty. Registered Tenement Houses.—The number of houses let in separate dwellings to members of more than one family, and registered under the Bye-laws, was 148. Registered Common Lodging Houses.—The supervision of these houses is still in the hands of the London County Council, so far as the enforcement of the Bye-laws is concerned. In matters of drainage, etc., the County Council refers to this authority. Thirty-one registered common lodging-houses will be found in List II. in the Appendix of this Report. Underground Rooms.—During the year 18 underground rooms were discontinued as dwellings. Canal Boats.—The canal boats, to the number of 34, used as dwellings, and moored in this district, were inspected and found in a satisfactory condition. INSANITARY AREAS. Churchway Area. —A Bill to confirm a Provisional Order made by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State for improving an area situated in the Parish of Saint Pancras in the County of London, and to be cited as the London (Churchway, St. Pancras) Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1897, has been presented to Parliament, and received the Royal Assent on March 29th, 1897. The Bran tome Place and Prospect Terrace Improvement Schemes have been duly sealed by your Vestry, and notices of the Schemes have been served on 49 every owner or reputed owner, lessee or reputed lessee, and occupiers of any part of the areas comprised in the Schemes, so far as those persons can reasonably be ascertained, and Petitions have since been prepared and lodged with the Local Government Board for Orders sanctioning the Schemes. The Inquiry was duly held by the Commissioner on the 10th and 16th March, 1897, and your Vestry are now awaiting the receipt of the Report from the Local Government Board. Area east of Chalton Street, Somers Town.—The Improvement Scheme for the area east of Chalton Street has also been duly sealed by your Vestry, and the Valuers have been instructed to make a valuation on behalf of your Vestry. BYE-LAWS FOR TENEMENT HOUSES, OR HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS TO MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. In February, 1897, I reported upon this subject, and the main points are here quoted below for future reference, as the matter is not yet closed. On the 1st December, 1896, the London County Council resolved— (a) That the Medical Officer be instructed to make a further inquiry at Midsummer, 1897, as to the extent to which By-laws or regulations dealing with houses let in lodgings are enforced in the several Sanitary Districts of London, with a view to the Council making a representation to the Local Government Board under Section 101 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the case of any Sanitary Authority which is not by that time carrying out the provisions of Section 94 of the Act. (b) That a copy of this report, and the Council's resolution thereon, be sent to each of the London Sanitary Authorities. By the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 94 (1), every Sanitary Authority shall make and enforce such By-laws as are requisite for the following matters (that is to say)—(a), fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house, or part of a house, which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied; (b), for the registration of houses so let or occupied; (c), for the inspection of such houses; (d), for enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses; (e), for the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises; (/), for taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease. (2) This section shall not apply to common lodging-houses within the Common Lodging Houses Act, 1851, or any Act amending the same. By Section 100, the County Council, on it being proved to their satisfaction that any Sanitary Authority have made default in doing their duty under this Act with respect to the removal of any nuisance, the institution of any proceedings, or the enforcement of any By-laws, may institute any proceeding and do any act which the Authority might have instituted or done for that purpose, and shall be entitled to recover from the Sanitary Authority in 50 default all such expenses in and about the said proceeding or act as the County Council incur, and are not recovered from any other person, and have not been incurred in any unsuccessful proceedings. In the report of his inquiry, the Medical Officer of Health of the County Council, Mr. Shirley Murphy, stated that the opinions of those best qualified to judge, are strongly in favour of By-laws, that difficulties have disappeared where they have been seriously undertaken by "sufficient staff provided for that purpose," that still better results would have been attained " if larger use had been made of the power conferred by By-laws to proceed directly for penalty instead of adopting the method of serving notices." In his Report Dr. Hamer, the Assistant Medical Officer, stated that he attempted " to learn whether or not the putting in force of a code of By-laws or regulations enables conditions to be dealt with which are not capable of being remedied, or can only with difficulty be remedied, under the general provisions of the Public Health Act." He refers to the evidence given before the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes in 1S85, by the late Dr. Tripe, Medical Officer of Health, Hackney, where 5,000 houses were on the Register, who stated that the great advantage of having regulations was that proceedings could be taken for breach of regulations, and that it was not necessary in each instance to convince the magistrate that what was complained of was a nuisance injurious to health. He points out that, in the matter of cleansing, the specific requirements of the By-laws have been most useful; that, in the matter of overcrowdiny, the By-laws define overcrowding, that they enable penalties to be more easily obtained, and that they enable inspection to be made at other times than those specified in the general Act, that placing houses on the register tends to cause owners to reduce the number of occupants of tenements, but that in proceeding by notice to abate overcrowding " presumably what happens in many cases is that the persons merely transfer themselves from one tenement to another, while the amount of overcrowding in the district remains unaltered; that, in the matter of proceeding without notice, as regards cleansing, the experience is entirely favourable, and, as regards overcrowding it is also favourable, but full use has not hitherto been made of the power to proceed straightway for penalty on proof of infringement. Other matters can be dealt with by By-laws, but cleansing and overcrowding are the main questions. He concludes by indicating some difficulties, the first being that of insufficient staff for the systematic inspection of registered houses, the demand of other work upon the time of Sanitary Inspectors having prevented even Chelsea (with 1700 registered houses, and Hackney with 5000 registered houses), these two Authorities having Regulations prior to 1885, from keeping their registers up to date ; the second difficulty being that in Court the procedure is somewhat complicated, formal proof of registration is required, and change of ownership may delay proceedings, and in sub-letting, questions as to the person liable may arise. In considering the working of the Vestry's By-laws, these several points have also attracted my attention, and my views thereon are fairly definable. Cubic-space and overcrowding.—It would be conducive to the better regulation of registered tenement houses if a single minimum standard of cubic space could be adopted instead of the varying amounts of 300 and 400 cubic 51 feet. For instance, if 400 were adopted for all purposes and two children under 10 years reckoned as one adult, it would be possible to place on record in the Register the maximum number that a room and a house would be permitted to accommodate. This number would then be constant instead of continually varying, according to whether rooms are used for living or sleeping purposes, the variation often rendering the original records in the Register valueless, so Jar as numbers are concerned, almost as soon as entered. This single minimum standard would have a further advantage, since a house may be overcrowded as to its sanitary convenience, etc., as well as in regard to its cubic space, and it would be possible to fix the amount of sanitary convenience required to accommodate the maximum number of persons dwelling in the house. But it would be desirable to go even further than as suggested above, in defining by statute the minimum amount of cubic space per head permissible in dwelling-houses. This has already been done with regard to factories and workshops in section 1 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, as set out in the earlier part of this Report, parallel with the By-laws as to cubicspace. The advantage of this course would be that it would apply to all dwelling-houses, and if the minimum standard were fixed as low as at present, it would prevent that degree of overcrowding of human beings which should be abated wherever met with, and it is greatly to be regretted that the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, does not define what is "overcrowding" in dwelling-houses. Cleansing.—If, as suggested, the minimum amount of cubic space per head were fixed by statute for dwelling-houses, then, except that of differentiating the duties of landlords and tenants respectively, the only definite point remaining to be enforced by the By-laws would be that of annual cleansing. This point also might with advantage be made applicable to all dwelling-houses by statute, if it were provided that, where, in the opinion of the Sanitary , Authority, on account of the mode of occupation or of usage, a dwelling-house should be cleansed annually, the Sanitary Authority may pass a resolution and make an order to that effect, and be empowered to enforce the order. Procedure.—The difficulty of procedure before Magistrates is to convince Magistrates that defects proved to exist are nuisances within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Definite statute law or By-law facilitates Magistrates going through the process of being convinced, and also relieves them of the responsibility of deciding what is and what is not a nuisance. The London County Council appear to desire Sanitary Authorities to proceed without giving notice. The St. Pancras By-laws appear to preclude this possibility, but even if the Vestry were desirous of the officers proceeding without giving notice, and therefore without the instruction of the Health Committee or the Vestry in each individual case, still there would be some risks in so proceeding. The owner has to be ascertained or confirmed in each case before proceeding. A tenement house not unfrequently changes hands, and if there be a new 52 Owner immediate proceedings cannot wisely be taken until after the now owner has been supplied with all the information his predecessor was supplied with. In the case of a tenant the same applies. In Court the owner may deny having received the necessary information, or may plead that it was so long ago as to have escaped memory, and Magistrates are not anxious to convict when defendants have received no notice. Magistrates also require proof of registration in each case. Lastly, it is in the experience of the Vestry that there are dwelling-houses that do not come, and cannot be brought, within the scope of By-laws for tenement-houses—for one instance, Equity Buildings—yet such class of houses require control as much as, aud in many cases more than, the other class of bouses. WASHHOUSES. In providing for bathing and washing, the ultimate aim may be said to be that every house should contain in itself bathing and washing accommodation for the use of the occupants, and that every locality should possess public swimming baths open all the year round for the cleanly exercise and recreation of its residents. 1.— The provision of single baths and coppers in dwelling houses rather than at a distance away from them. There are 25,000 dwelling houses in St. Pancras, of which probably not one-tenth are supplied with baths, it is hopeless therefore to expect to provide 22,500 single baths at public expense for the remaining 22,500 houses. This number is about what would be required if one bath were assumed to accommodate nine persons, and if every person took a bath every day, assuming that there are about eight persons in every house (the census number was 8*7 persons per house), but if the interval of bathing were prolonged to a week, it would even then require 3,500 single baths to be provided. In all new neighbourhoods even the smallest and cheapest houses have baths and coppers provided, and it must be admitted that it is desirable for older neighbourhoods to follow the example. If they do not they will gradually lose the more cleanly, industrious, and intelligent portion of their population ; whilst the less cleanly—the improvident and the listless portion—will remain behind. If owners neglect to respond to the "spirit of the time, the better tenants will forsake their present houses for newer neighbourhoods, the older neighbourhoods will suffer, together with all those who have interests in them. The construction of public single baths and washhouses will not save the situation. It may be worth considering whether some means cannot be devised for bringing to the notice of house owners the ultimate advantaga of providing proper bathing and washing accommodation, and for encouraging them in any efforts they may make towards improving the houses of their tenants, aud consequently the locality and the dis trict. 53 2.—The provision of large public swimming baths, warmed in winter so as to maintain a uniform temperature, and to keep them in use all tho year round. Such baths being provided for two sexes, and two classes. These baths are intended primarily for healthy exercise, and are with advantage supplemented by rooms and implements for calisthenic exercises, or by halls and apparatus for gymnastics. Cleanliness is also served by swimming b:iths, but in a lesser degree than by single baths. Well-constructed swimming baths are even of more value to the young in the development of manhood and womanhood than open spaces: for they cleanse whilst they exercise. It is only a public Authority that can provide adequate public swimming baths. Good public swimming baths are greatly valued as a means of recreation, exercise, and cleanliness, and attract the more vigorous and prosperous portions of the community to the district. It is therefore greatly to the interest of all concerned that a public Authority should not hesitate to improve a locality by the erection of public swimming baths, and thereby obtain some right to press for the parallel action by house owners installing private baths. It must not be understood that a public Authority should not erect any single baths and washhouses at all, but that single baths and washhouses cannot be erected in sufficient numbers by the public Authority of a crowded district, and that the proper place for them is attached to dwellinghouses, rather than grouped together at a distance. 3.—It should be added that large numbers of places that should be sculleries and washhouses, situated in out-buildings and kitohens, are converted into dwelling-rooms, wit h the result that dwelling-houses are overcrowded to a serious extent. The most beneficial step that might be takon would be to cause these places to be reconverted to their proper uses, and be set apart for the washing and bathing of the occupants of the tenement-houses of which they form part. The absence of a washing place in a crowded house is a very serious matter, and the seriuusness appears to be totally unappreciated. In by far the largest majority of tenemented or made-down houses the occupants have young families; personal cleanliness is a foremost measure for the preservation of the health and the development of the vigour of the children, especially cleanliness of the underclothing and of the skin. How is the mother of a family of young children living in one or two rooms to do her washing P She cannot take her children to the public baths and washhouses with her, and consequently the family washing both of person and clothing has to be done in a one or two-roomed dwelling (if done at all), under the most adverse conditions,—conditions educationally bad and most discouraging to cleanliness. I cannot express my opinion too strongly, — (1) That in every tenemented house there should be required to be provided a place where the occupants can do their clothes washing and person al'cleansing. (2) That, as St. Pancras contains such a very large number of one and two-roomed dwellings, the bye-laws for tenemented houses should be supplemented by a bye-law requiring the provision of accommodation for clothes washing and personal cleansing. 54 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 & 1891. Provisions as to Inhabited House Duty upon Houses Constructed in Separate Dwellings. By the Customs and Iuland Revenue Act, 1890 (53 Vict., Ch. 8), it is provided : — " 26.—(1) Where any dwelling-house chargeable to inhabited house duty under the said Act of the fourteenth and fifteenth years of Her Majesty's reign, chapter thirty-six, at the rate of ninepence, or at the reduced rate of sixpence or threepence, according to this Act, for every twenty shillings of annual value is occupied in any year by a person for the main purpose of letting furnished lodgings therein as a means of livelihood, it shall be lawful for such person before the first day of July to register his name in a list of lodging-house keepers to be kept by the Clerk to the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to the inhabited house duties, and, after such registration and before the first day of October, to make application to the said Commissioners for the reduction of the rate of charge of inhabited house duty from ninepence to sixpence, or for the further reduction of the reduced rate of sixpence to fourpence, or of threepence to twopence, and on due proof of the facts to the satisfaction of the said Commissioners they shall cause the charge or amount for such year to be reduced or amended accordingly. " (2) The assessment to inhabited house duty of any house originally built or adapted by additions or alterations and used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of seven shillings and sixpence a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents, shall be discharged by the said Commissioners, provided that a certificate of the medical officer of health for the district in which the house is situate or other medioal practitioner, appointed as hereinafter provided, shall be produced to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. The medical officer of health of a district on request by the person who would be liable to pay the house duty on any house in the district, if the duty were not discharged as aforesaid, shall examine the house for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a certificate can properly be given, and if the house be constructed so as to afford such accommodation and due provision be made as aforesaid, shall certify the same accordingly ; provided that the authority, if they are of opinion that the duties which would devolve on the medical officer of health under this section could not be performed by him without interference with the due performance of his ordinary duties, may appoiut some other 55 legally qualified medical practitioner having the qualification required for office of medical officer of health of the district to make such examinations and give such certificates as aforesaid. " As respects Scotland the expression ' medical officer of health ' means a medical officer within the meaning of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1867." By the Act of the following year, namely, the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1891 (54 and 55 Vict., Ch. 25), it is further provided:— "4.—(1.) Sub-section two of section twenty-six of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, is hereby amended by the substitution of the words ' where the annual value of each dwelling shall not amount to twenty pounds,' for the words for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of seven shillings and sixpence a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents.' " (2) In the case of any house, originally built, or adapted by additions or alterations, and used, so far as the same is used as a dwellinghouse, for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings at an annual value not exceeding forty pounds for each dwelling, the Corumisioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to Inhabited House Duties shall, upon production of such a certificate as is mentioned in the said sub-section, grant relief by confining the assessment to the annual value of the house, exclusive of every dwelling therein of an annual value below twenty pounds (if any), and by reducing the rate of duty to threepence. " (3) The provisions in the said sub section in relation to a certificate shall apply to a certificate to be produced under this section." After long and serious consideration, many interviews with experts and interested persons, and several tentative efforts, I drew the following form of certificate at the end of 1893. Since then it has been adopted, with or without slight modification, by many medical officers of health. Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 53 and 54 Vict,., cap. 8, sec. 26 (2) and 54 und 55 Vict., cap 25, sec. 4, Inhabited House Duty. i " Certificate of Medical Officer of Health. Having been furnished with evidence that the assessment of Inhabited House Duty of the house described below will be wholly or partly discharged by the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to Inhabited House Duties, provided that a Certificate of tho Medical Officer of Health be produced, and having been requested to furnish the said Certificate. I hereby certify that I have examined the house described below, and am of opinion that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each 56 of the persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements, these words being interpreted to mean that the house is so constructed:— 1.—That each of the persons inhabiting it is provided with at least four hundred cubic feet of air space. 2.—That each of the living or sleeping rooms is at least eight feet in height, and at least 96 square feet in area. 3.—That there is at least one draw tap and sink, with a sufficient supply of water thereto, for every twelve occupants or less, on each floor. 4.—That there is at least one water-closet, properly supplied with water, for every twelve occupants or less, on each floor. 5.—That the drainage of the premises is in accordance with the Regulations recognized by this Authority. 6.— That accommodation for clothes washing is provided, sufficient for the number of persons inhabiting the house.

Sanitaru Conveniences in Factories.—As there appeared to be some doubt and division of authority in these matters, the following letter was addressed to H.M. Cnief Inspector:— " Public Health Act, 1875, Section 38. " Where it appears to any Local Authority, by the report of their surveyor, that any house is used, or iutended to be used, as a factory or building in which persons of both sexes are employed, or intended 57 to be employed, at one time in any manufacture, trade, or business, the Local Authority may, if they think fit, by written notice, require the owner or occupier of such house, within the time therein specified, to construct a sufficient number of water-closets, earth-closets, or privies and ash-pits, for the separate use of each sex. " Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any such notice shall be liable for each default to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds, and to a further penalty not exceeding forty shillings for every day during which the default is continued." From this section it appears that any Local Authority, Urban or Rural, can take action, and that it only applies to premises where both sexes are employed, and that it is not retrospective. " Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1895, Section 22. " (1) Every building used as a workshop or manufactory, or where persons are employed, or intended to be employed, in any trade or business, whether erected before or after the adoption of this part of this Act in any district, shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, having regard to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at such building, and also where persons of both sexes are employed, or intended to be employed or in attendance, With proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex. " (2) Where it appears to an Urban Authority on the report of their Surveyor that the provisions of this section are not complied with in the case of any building, the Urban Authority may, if they think fit, bv written notice, require the owner or occupier of any such building to make such alterations and additions therein as may be required to give such sufficient, suitable, and proper accommodation as aforesaid. " (3) Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any such notice shall be liable for each default to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds and to a daily penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. " (4) Where this section is in force Section 38 of the Public Health Act, 1875, shall be repealed," This section repeals the previously quoted Section, so far as concerns Urban Districts that have adopted this section. It will be observed that this section applies to every factory and workshop whether persons of both sexes are employed or not. It will be further observed that this section is retrospective, and applies to factories and workshops used before 1890. It will be further observed that neither of these Acts applies to London, but are useful as demonstrating the general position. " Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 38. " (1) Every factory, workshop, and workplace, whether erected before or after the passing of this Act, shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at 53 such building, and also where persons of both sexes are, or are intended to be, employed or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex. " (2) Where it appears to a sanitary authority that this section is not complied with in the case of any factory, workshop, or workplace, the sanitary authority shall, by notice served on the owner or occupier of such factory, workshop, or workplace, require him to make the alterations and additions necessary to secure such compliance, and if the person served with such notice fails to comply therewith, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and to a fine not exceeding forty shillings for every day after conviction during which the non-compliance continues." This section corresponds to the last section quoted, except that in the last section, and also in the section quoted previously, it is made to appear to the authority by " the report of their surveyor." In the London Act, on the other hand, the words " where it appears to a sanitary authority" are used, the presumption being through report or complaint of anybody, whether their own officer, or occupier, or workperson, or an anonymous person, or even by H.M. Inspector of Factories, since 1878, and at this time, 1891, H.M. Inspector of Factories gave notice of cases coming under this section to sanitary authorities in accordance with the section quoted below. Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, Section 4. " Where it appears to an inspector under this Act, that any act, neglect, or default in relation to any drain, water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ash-pit, water-supply, nuisance, or other matter in a factory or workplace, is punishable or remedial under the law relating to public health, but not under this Act, that inspector shall give notice in writing of such act, neglect, or default, to the sanitary authority in whose district the factory or workshop is situate, and it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority to make such inquiry into the subject of the notice, and take such action thereon, as to that authority may seem proper for the purpose of enforcing the law. " An inspector under this Act may, for the purpose of this section, take with him into a factory or workshop, a medical officer of health, inspector of nuisances, or other officer of the sanitary authority." Where notice is given under this section the sanitary authority is required to inform H.M. Inspector of Factories of proceedings in accordance with section 3 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, and where proceedings are not taken by the sanitary authority within a month H.M. Inspector may take such proceedings, under section 2, sub-section 3, of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891. From this it would appear that it was not contemplated that H.M. Inspector should take action with regard to sanitary conveniences in factories, except by complaint to the sanitary authority, and in default of the sanitary authority proceeding. But, in 1896 a change comes over the scene. So far as London is concerned, in my opinion through the parliamentary 59 draughtsmen having omitted to insert the words " and section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891," after the words " section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890," in the following section :— factory and Workshop Act, 1895, Section 35. " (I) In every place where section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, is not in force, every factory or workshop shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, having regard to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at the factory or workshop, and also where persons of both sexes are employed, or intended to be employed, or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex. " (2) A factory or workshop in which there is a contravention of this section shall be deemed not to be kept in conformity with the principal Act"— It is evident that this section only applies to places where section 22 of the Public Health Amendment Act, 1890, is not enforced, and that in those places it is the duty of II. M. Inspector to make good the oversight or omission of the sanitary authority, by obtaining a penalty from the owner or occupier of the factory ; but in order to enforce carrying out the section it appears to be necessary for H.M Inspector to fall back upon section 4 of the 1878 Act, and give notice in writing to the sanitary authority. The omission of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, from the above-mentioned section 35 makes it appear that the penalty for the non-provision of sanitary conveniences in factories may be enforced either by the sanitary authority or by the factory inspector in London; but it reasonable to expect that the owner or occupier should have had notice to provide the accommodation required before being prosecuted for a penalty, and this coincides with the procedure of sanitary authorities. The intention therefore of section 35 of the Act of 1895 appears to be to empower H.M. Inspector to take action only in default of the sanitary authority. This is explicitly stated with regard to Districts where section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, is not in force, but not in regard to London ; but as section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is almost word lor word the same as section 22 of the Public Health Acts' Amendment Act, 1890, it would appear that in this case also the Legislature contemplated that only in default should action be taken by H.M. Inspector in London, and it is difficult to conceive that two different methods of procedure should have been intended to be adopted in a matter of this kind, one without and the other within London. Perhaps the parliamentary draughtsmen may intentionally have omitted to mention section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, in section 35 of the last Factory and Workshop Act inasmuch as the London Act, not being an adoptive Act, there could not be any place in London where it was not in force. To briefly summarise, in London it appears to be the duty of H.M. Inspectors of Factories to recover penalties for the non-provision of sanitary conveniences in factories, and to give notice in writing to sanitary authorities for the remedies to be applied, to require to be informed by sanitary authorities of 60 the proceedings taken, and if not taken within one month to proceed as Sanitary Authorities might have proceeded. It appears to be the duty of London Sanitary Authorities to receive complaints from anybody, including their own officers, and also from H.M. Inspectors of Factories, to order sanitary conveniences to be provided in factories, to see that they are constructed according to by-laws and regulations, and to supervise their construction. As to the number of sanitary conveniences to be provided, apart from districts outside the Metropolis, it would be desirable to agree to a standard in London. Bakehouses.—These are dealt with under the head of Food Premises, Part V., and accompanied by a diagram showing the level of the ceiling and floor of each bakehouse in the district with reference to ground level. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. At the beginning of November, 1895, Colonel Ducat, on behalf of the Local Government Board, held an inquiry into an application of the London County Council to amend the regulations made by the Water Companies of London under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871. The application was— (a) To amend Regulation No. 21 by substituting the work " three " for " two " before the words " gallons of water at each flush." (b) To add the following definition of " water-closet " to the Regulations, viz., the word " water-closet" in these regulations shall include any sink used for receiving any solid or liquid excremental filth," and from Regulation No. 20, line 2, to omit the words in parentheses. (c) To make a regulation which will prevent cisterns being brought into use for supplying water for domestic purposes or for food for beasts, so long as they directly supply any water-closet or sink used for receiving any solid or liquid filth. (d) To make a regulation requiring that, in all cases where any premises have a constant water service, one or more taps shall be provided in connection with the rising main for the supply of water for drinking purposes. At the enquiry your Medical Officer of Health gave evidence amongst a a'number of other witnesses. In April, 1896, a copy of the Report of Colonel Ducat, dated 10th December, 1895, was received by your Health Department. The Report concludes with these recommendations:— In this application of the London County Council to alter, amend, and add to the Regulations of the Metropolitan Water Companies, I recommend that the suggestions made be disposed of as follows, viz.:— (a) To alter Regulation No. 21 to increase the maximum flush to a w.c. " from 2 gallons to 3 gallons " be not sanctioned, as the necessity for it is not proved. 61 (&) To add the following definition of " water-closet, " to the Regulations, viz., the word " water-closet" in these Regulations shall include any " sink used for receiving any solid or liquid excremental filth," and from Regulation No 20, line 2, to omit the words in parentheses, be sanctioned, and the regulations be altered accordingly. This addition, in itself, is desirable, but is not very pressingly called for, as I believe that such sinks, not being actual water-closets, are very rarely in use, except in hospitals; and in most, if not all the hospitals in London, water is supplied by meter on the lowest scale of charges, and there is thus no restriction on the use of water or the size of flush used. I understand that the Water Companies contemplate applying to the Board shortly to further amend and alter the Regulations ; and, if such an application is made, the above suggestion (b) might stand over until, the whole of the alterations of the Regulations that may be found necessary have been decided on. (c) and (d) not being, properly speaking, Water Regulations, should not be sanctioned as such. Walter M. Ducat. Whitehall, 10th December, 1895. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Combined Drainage.—A Bill before the House of Lords to amend the definition of "drain" and "sewer" under the Public Health Act, 1875, was withdrawn, and Lord Russell of Killowen stated that all the law of drainage required consolidation and amendment. A similar Bill before the House of Commons, supported by the London County Council, also failed to become law. Separate W.C. Accommodation m Schools.—The unsuitableness of "latrine" or "trough" closets for schools has been established by the following case: — Plans were submitted to the Battersea Vestry by the School Board for London in respect of an extension of the Shillington Street Board School. The plans provided fora dditional water-closets upon the " trough " system, by means of stoneware latrines, which the Vestry refused to sanction, and called upon the School Board for London to provide " separate " water-closet basins with branch drains into suitable inspection chambers. The London School Board appealed to the London County Council against the order of the Vestry ; but the Council, having heard evidence on both sides, on the 27th July, 1896, dismissed the appeal. REFUSE REMOVAL. In March, 1892, a new system of dust collection was adopted by the Vestry and put in force. This system was devised after much time and thought had been devoted to the subject, and was embodied in a contract that was most carefully drawn, and frorn year to year improved in detail, the essential clauses of which describe the system and method of control. ***** 62 4.—Once in each and every week, and oftener if required, the Contractor's men shall call, knock, or ring at each and every house, tenement or premises, in every street or other place in the said Division, and shall carry away all dust, ashes, or house refuse, which shall from time to time be collected, lodged, and found on any premises, or which shall be brought to the doors thereof, and the Contractor shall attend to and be bound by any notices, rules, regulations, orders, directions, or instructions that may from time to time be issued by the Chief Commissioner of the Police, or any other public officer, in pursuance of any power vested in such officer. A list of the streets and other places in each of the districts into which the Division is divided will be furnished, and the streets and other places therein referred to shall be numbered or arranged in such list in the order in which the dust, ashes, or house refuse shall be removed therefrom ; such order to be consecutive according to contiguity, and shall be strictly adhered to by the Contractor, his agents or servants. On every Monday morning in each week, during the continuance of the contract, a dust cart, with men provided, shall commence at the street or other place numbered one or placed first on the said list, and the Contractor, his agents or servants, shall call at and collect from every house, from house to house in the street or other place, the house refuse accumulated during the week, since the call of the previous cart. When such street or place has been completed, the cart shall then proceed to the street or place next on the list, and so on day by day until the whole of the streets and other places in the district shall have been traversed and completed by the said cart, and in such a manner that the carts shall follow one another through the district, from house to house, and street to street at intervals of one week. The Contractor shall likewise give immediate attention to any instructions he may receive from the Medical Officer of Health in special cases. * * • • • 8.—The Contractor shall appoint men to work with each cart or van, and shall, immediately on the commencement of the Contract, furnish to the Medical Officer of Health a list (in writing) of the carts or vans to be employed, with the names of the men appointed thereto set against the said carts and vans respectively, and shall on every Monday morning in each week, during the continuance of this Contract, in like manner furnish the number of each of the carts and the names of each of the men in attendance, commencing each District in the Division, and any change in the Carts or of the men attending the carts shall be duly notified to the Medical Officer of Health; and within twenty-four hours after the discharge of any man so employed, and of every new man employed, and of any and every alteration which may from time to time be made, or may occur in such appointments, he shall from time to time give like notice in writing to the Medical Officer of Health. 9.—The Contractor shall not remove or cause to be removed from either of the Districts of the Division any dust cart or van during the day, except to discharge its contents or in case of accident; and no change or alteration shall take place without the consent of the Medical Officer of Health having been first obtained, in which case such necessary change or alteration shall take place with the commencement of the day. 63 10.—The Contractor shall at all times, during the continuance of the Contract, provide that every cart or van leaving its beat for the purpose of discharging its contents, shall immediately return after so discharging and re-commence collecting at the house next in order to that last visited. 11.—The Contractor shall not collect trade refuse, or any form of refuse for which removal is payable by the owner or occupier, in any cart or van especially set apart for collecting house refuse. 12.—The Contractor shall, in case any owner or occupier of any premises refuses to have his dust removed at the periodical time, when the cart or van calls for that purpose, report such refusal within twenty-four hours (Sunday excepted) to the Medical Officer of Health. * * * * * 26.—If at any time it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health that the Contractor or his men shall do any act forbidden, or shall neglect to do any act required, by the provisions of this Contract, then and in every such case, in addition to employing special carts and men as aforesaid, it shall be and may be lawful for the said Medical Officer of Health to fine such Contractor] in the several sums of money hereinafter mentioned, namely:— (1) For every neglect or offence for which special penalties are not provided in the execution of the duties of scavenger, a sum not exceeding twenty pounds. (2) For employing any man, horse, cart, van or implements objected to by the Medical Officer of Health, under any of the provisions of this Contract twenty shillings, and twenty shillings per day during which such offence shall continue. (3) For taking any man, horse, cart, van or implements out of the daily work which the Contractor undertakes to perform without the permission of the Medical Officer of Health, five pounds. (4) For neglecting to call, knock or ring at any house, tenement or premises, five shillings. (5) For asking for or demanding any money, fee or gratuity of any description, twenty shillings. (6) For neglecting to supply the Medical Officer of Health with the list of men, carts and vans employed, as required by Section 8, twenty shillings, and twenty shillings per day during which such offence shall continue. (7) For neglecting to supply such a number of men, horses, carts, vans and implements as in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health are necessary for the proper execution of this Contract, twenty shillings in respect of each man, horse, cart or van and implements, and twenty shillings per day during which such neglect shall continue. 64 (8) For assigning, underletting or disposing of this Contract without the permission of the Vestry, or for employing men otherwise than in accordance with Section 22, a sum not exceeding one hundred pounds. (9) For permitting the practice of "totting" or "sorting," twenty shillings for each offence. (10) For using any shoot in Saint Pancras without the permission of the Medical Officer of Health, or for neglecting to keep such shoot in proper condition, twenty pounds. This pioneer system has worked exceedingly well and has been adopted or imitated by a number of other Authorities. The proof of efficient working is shown by the number of dust complaints received each quarter during the past six years.

Compulsory removal of house-refuse.— In November, 1896, I presented a report to your Health Committee upon the compulsory power to remove dust, the principal points of which are as stated. The liability of this Authority with regard to the removal of dust is contained in Section 30 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891: " (1) It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority (a) to secure the due removal at proper periods of house-refuse from premises, and the due cleansing out and emptying at proper periods of ash-pits, and of earth-closets, privies and cesspools (if any) in the district, and the giving of sufficient notice of the time appointed for such removal, cleansing out and emptying, and (b) where the house-refuse is not removed from any premises in the district at the ordinary period, or any ash-pit, earth-closet, privy or cesspool in or under any building in the district is not cleansed out at the ordinary period, and the occupier of the premises serves on the Authority a written notice requiring the removal of such refuse, or the cleansing out or emptying of the ash-pit, earth-closet, privy, or cesspool, as the case may be, to comply with such notice within forty-eight hours after that service, exclusive of Sundays and public holidays: (2) If a Sanitary Authority fail, without reasonable cause, to comply with this Section, they shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds: (3) If any person in 65 the employ of the Sanitary Authority, or of any Contractor with the Sanitary Authority, demands from an occupier or his servant any fee or gratuity for removing any house refuse from any premises, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings. The ordinary period mentioned in the above Section 30 (1) (b) is that named in Bye-law 7 of the Bye-laws of the London County Council, under Section 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as to the removal and disposal of refuse:—"The Sanitary Authority shall cause to be removed not less frequently than once in every week the house refuse produced on all premises within their district." The duty of allowing house refuse to be removed every week falls upon the occupier, and the duty is contained in Section 126 of the Metropolis Local Management Act:—Any occupier of any house or land, or other person, who refuses or does not permit any soil, dirt, ashes, or filth to be taken away by the scavengers appointed by or contracting with any Vestry or Board, as aforesaid, or who obstructs the said scavengers in the performance of their duty, shall for every such offence forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding £5. On referring to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the 4th Schedule, amongst the sections of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, which are repealed, is included "section 126, as from the coming into operation of any Bye-law made for the like object." It is further provided in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 142 (4): " Any enactment expressed in the fourth Schedule to this Act to be repealed as from the coming into operation of any Bye-law made for the like object, shall, although no such Bye-law is made, be repealed on the expiration of twelve months next after the commencement of this Act, or such later day, not exceeding eighteen months from such commencement, as may be fixed by Order in Council." I have been informed by the Medical Officer of Health that the London County Council has made no Bye-law dealing with refusal to allow the removal of dust, being of opinion that section 116 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, gives the Sanitary Authority all necessary power. Section 116 (1) is as follows:—" If any person (a) wilfully obstructs any member or officer of a Sanitary Authority, or any person duly employed in the execution of this Act, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds." By section 31 of the same Act it is enacted, "Every Sanitary Authority shall employ a sufficient number of scavengers, or contract with any scavengers, whether a company or individuals, for the execution of the duties of the Sanitary Authority under this Act with respect to the sweeping and cleansing of the several streets within their district, and the collection and removal of street refuse and house refuse, and the cleansing out and emptying of ash-pits, earthclosets, privies, and cesspools." It is quite clear from this that the scavengers, or dustmen, who are employed by the Contractors on behalf of the Sanitary Authority, are persons duly employed in the execution of this Act, so that any person refusing to allow the scavengers or other persons employed by the Contractors in the collection of house refuse to remove the refuse when called upon is guilty of obstruction under section 116 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and liable to a fine not exceeding £5 accordingly. 66 The case of Borrow v. Rowland, heard in the Queen's Bench, before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Wills, May 15, 1896, defines " obstruction." The Vestry of Islington had summoned one Howland for " obstruction " within 54 and 55 Vic., c. 76, sec. 116, because he did not permit the scavenger to remove the dust. The Magistrate refused to convict, whereupon the Vestry appealed. Howland appeared and stated that within the short time from the previous collection there was very little dust, no nuisance, and that it was an unnecessary' annoyance to collect his refuse once a week. The Lord Chief Justice stated that the Magistrate ought to have convicted. If a person was allowed to do as the respondent had done, it would be impossible to carry out the Act. The act done by the respondent was clearly wilful, "the obstruction need not take the form of physical violence." Hence it appears that within reasonable hours every householder in the district is bound to admit the dustman. It is no answer to say that there is very little dust, or that the dust does not require removal, or to desire the dustman to call at some other time. Within the hours stated in the Contract the dustman has a right to call and look for dust, even though there be no dust there. This position consequently makes the removal of house refuse compulsory when the dustman calls. NUISANCES. A large number of nuisances of various kinds were dealt with during the year, and Tabls 10 in the Appendix shows the requirements demanded to abate them.

The bakehouses were also inspected twice during the year, and the necessary cleansing enforced. From time to time fish-frying shops and marine stores have been inspected. The markets and market streets were kept under observation daily, and also on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. BAKEHOUSES. By the Factory and Workshops Act, 1895, it is enacted — Sec. 27. (3)—A place underground shall not be used as a bakehouse unless it is so used at the commencement of this Act, and if any place is so used in contravention of this Act, it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with the principal Act. This Act came into operation on the first day of January, 1896. In the Appendix (List Y.) to this Report will be found a complete list of Bakehouses in St. Pancras, in occupation on the 1st January, 1896. This list gives the situation of each bakehouse, the name of the occupier, distance of the floor above or below ground level, and the distance of the ceiling above or below ground level, and also a consecutive number. On the page next hereto is a diagram upon which the level of the ceiling and of the floor of each bakehouse, with regard to ground level is represented. The upper thick black line represents the ceiling and the lower thick black line the floor, the centre line represents the ground level and lines above and below the distances in feet, which are marked on the sides of the table. The numbers along the top and bottom of the diagram, are the key numbers of the bakehouses represented. Following the diagram is a table consisting of double columns of figures. The left-hand columns of figures are the key numbers of the bakehouses as they appear on the diagram in consecutive order of level, and the right-hand columns of figures are the numbers of the bakehouses as they appear in the List in the Appendix in consecutive order of locality. It will be observed that of the 200 bakehouses in St. Pancras 30, or 15 per cent., hardly one-sixth of the total number, have the floor above ground level; 51, or 74.5 per cent., nearly three-fourths of the 200, have the floor six feet or more below the level of the ground. Seventy-seven bakehouses, or 61.5 per cent. have the ceiling below ground line. Of those that have the ceiling above ground line, two have the level over 10 feet above, four over 9 feet, eight over 8 feet, fifteen over 7 feet, and the rest, 171, or 85.5 per cent., have the ceiling less than 7 feet above ground level. Although there is no statement in the Act that any portion whatever of a newly occupied or re-occupied bakehouse shall be permitted to be below the level of the ground, it will be a question, provided only a small portion be below ground level, and that portion be protected by a dry area of sufficient 71 width, and the walls have a proper damp course, or are cased in damp-proof cement, and all the other conditions are good, whether such a bakehouse may not be considered fit for occupation.

Markets and Market Streets were under the observation of the Sanitary Inspectors daily, and especially on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the Summer months. The following food, unfit for human consumption, was seized during the year : — DATE. Description of Articles Seized. REMARKS.

The symptoms may vary from simple nausea, or diarrhoea, to vomiting, and prostration and collapse. Tinned shellfish such as lobster is more liable to cause serious symptoms than tinned fish, such as salmon, and tinned meats still less frequently give rise to untoward symptoms, except meats into the composition of which pork enters. The reason tinned foods so frequently cause trouble when eaten, especially if they have been kept open a few hours during the hot weather before consumption, is that so much of the tinned foods in the cheaper markets are derived from old ship's stores. A ship upon sailing lays in certain stores of tinned foods, it often happens that these are not touched on the voyage, and they may go another voyage or not, but ultimately they are sold as old stores. The tins are then cleansed, recoloured, revarnished, and relabelled with clean fresh labels and resold. So again and again quantities of tinned foods may be resold year after year, and some of these come upon the general market and are sold in seaport and inland towns. Considerable quantities must find their way on to the London markets and be retailed by small grocers in the poorer neighbourhoods. 73 This is a risky condition of things that only requires public attention to be directed to it in order to obtain some remedy. It must be remembered that a large number of the cases of slight sickness or illness caused by tinned foods do not come into records, but they are more or less known to many families and most medical men. In addition to the liability of causing sickness, very stale tinned foods cannot possibly be so beneficial as nutriment, in fact in the course of years much of the proper dietetic effect must be lost. The remedy that suggests itself to me as effectual is to provide by law—that all tins containing tinned food shall have stamped upon the bottom the date of tinning. Shellfish.—The Local Government Board have issued an authoritative Report on oyster culture in relation to disease—Twenty-fourth Report of the Local Government Board supplement to the Report of the Medical Officer for 1894-5, London, 1896. Previous to this a number of observers had recorded the effects of sewage contaminated shellfish upon consumers, notably the late Dr. Bristowe. Also in the Journal of the Sanitary Institute, Part IV., 1896, was a paper upon "the spread of Enteric fever by means of sewage contaminated shellfish," by Dr. Arthur Newsholme. These Reports point to the fact that it is as dangerous to pollute estuaries with sewage as it is to pollute rivers, so that seaside towns in the proximity of river mouths will have to resort to some other methods than that of casting crude sewage into estuaries, and perhaps may have in some cases to bear the burden of sewage purification like inland towns.

VI.—Legislation. During the year 1896 a very important Act—to which slight attention has been paid—was passed by Parliament. The Act is known as 59 & 60 Vict., chap. 19, or the Public Health Act, 1696: an Act to make further provision with respect to epidemic, endemic, and infectious diseases, and to repeal the Acts relating to Quarantine. This Act is the coping-stone to the system of medical inspection, observation, and isolation gradually substituted by this country for quarantine since 1848; and now, after fifty years' promising, to be adopted internationally. It repeals the Quarantine Act of 1825, and transfers from the Privy Council to the Local Government Board the powers of control over infectious diseases—especially cholera, plague, and yellow fever—imported to these shores. Consequent upon the preceding, another Act was passed, 59 & 60 Vict., chap. 20, or the Public Health (Ports) Act, 1896, empowering the Local Government Board, by order, to assign to any Port Sanitary Authority any powers, rights, duties, capacities, and obligations under the Infectious Disease Prevention Act, 1890. SPECIAL REPORTS. In addition to weekly, monthly, and minor reports, special reports upon the following subjects have been printed and presented:— The recent Census—July, 1896. The Sanitary Congress—November, 1896. Temporary Shelters during Disinfection—October, 1896. The compulsory removal of house refuse—November, 1896. Bye-laws as to Houses let in lodgings (tenement houses)—January, 1897. Open spaces about buildings—February, 1897. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, JOHN F. J. SYKES. 76 Table 1. ST.
