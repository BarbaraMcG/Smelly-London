The duties resulting from the preparation of the Council's Air Raid Precautions scheme have thrown a considerable amount of extra work on the Public Health Department.

The birth rate for England and Wales in 1939 was 15. DEATH RATS. There were 330 deaths, as compared with 260 last year. The death rate for England and Wales for the year is 12.1 The increase in the death rate is due chiefly to diseases of the heart. The general health of the district remains very good. INFANTILE DEATH RATE. There were 20 deaths of children under one year as compared with 14 last year, a death rate per 1_,000 live births of 31.1. Last year the figure was 23.9. The infantile Death Rate for England and Wales for the year is 50. IREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISUSES. With the exception of Mumpts, all cases of infectious disease are now notifiable in the area, and particulars of those cases notified are given in Table 1. With regard to Diphtheria every facility for prompt diagnosis and treatment is placed at the disposal of local doctors, swabs for examinations of throat etc. and a supply of antitoxin are kept in readiness at the Council Offices. In addition, the Council has now given facilities for the supply of immunising serum. This is available in necessitous cases on the application of local doctors. 18 Children were immunised during the year* It is to be regretted that more advantage is not being taken of the facilities now provided for preventive immunisation. In the case of Measles there is more difficulty in obtaining the convalescent and adult serum, but in time it is to be hoped that the extended use of preventive_immunisation will reduce the chances of a fatal termination in both these diseases to the vanishing point. Similar facilities for bacteriological diagnosis are available in cases of Tuberculosis and other Infectious Diseases and full advantage is taken of them. During the year, reports on the following swabs and sputa sent for bacteriological examination were received:- Swabs taken from suspicious cases of Diphtheria, positive nil, negative 119. Sputa taken from suspicious cases of tuberculosis, ppsitive nil, negative 19. 2 In all infectious cases where patients are removed to isolation or special hospitals, the patient's home is visited and disinfection thoroughly carried out SMALLPOX No cases of this disease were notified during the year TUBERCULOSIS A table is given showing new cases and mortality during 1939 Whenever possible all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis likely to benefit are sent to the County Sanatorium at Ware In every case thorough disinfection of the premises etc , is carried out as soon as the patient has been removed TABLE 1.
