Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Vestry, I have now to present my report for the second quarter, 1858, comprising 13 weeks, from April 3rd to July 3rd. I have, during this period, presented five reports to the Vestry, and one in accordance with the new arrangements, to the Sewers Committee. The usual Tables are appended to this report. The first Table shews the mortality of the different quarters, as compared with those of other years : the first, third and fourth quartets show considerable changes, not only in themselves, but as compared with the average; but in the quarter upon which I am now reporting, the number of deaths recorded, is for 1856,292; for 1857,296; and for 1858, 299—the average is 294'8. The causes of death in the second quarter, seem therefore, to be very uniform, and the results, so far as numbers go, equally so. The actual number for 1858, 296, should (for correct application) be compared with the average, increased by one-tenth for increase of population ; in which case a marked improvement will be evident: 299 as against 324.2 the corrected average.. To set forth the condition of our Parish alone, will no doubt, give us much useful information : this, however, is much better attained by comparison. The condition of a few other Parishes, which may be suitably compared with ours, is therefore given, as before, in the second Table. I have selected some, with certain fixed and important characteristics, and with the fewest disturbing elements ; free from large hospitals which receive the sick and dying of other districts. The first column of this Table shows what those characteristics are; and the last nine columns show the results in sickness and mortality; not that the experience of a quarter taken alone, will be of much value; but the records of quarter after quarter and year after year, will, I have no doubt, prove most valuable. In columns ten and twelve this Parish shows for the past a higher mortality than any. In column sixteen, our present mortality is shewn as being less unfavorable than three of the others, and as bearing a very good comparison with two others of the Parishes better situated. The third Table shews a considerably increased mortality from Zymotic disease; 34 in the last or hottest month : the excess, no doubt, owing chiefly to the heated and stagnant condition of the atmosphere. The meteorological condition of April and May calls for no remark beyond what the Table shows. The mean temperature of the quarter was only 2 degrees above the average; but in June, when the principal mortality took place, the mean temperature was 66'5 Fahrenheit; last June it was 63-2; the average for the last thirty years, 59'G. On the 16th the highest temperature in the shade was 94'5: fourteen days were over 80 deg. in the shade, and twenty-two over 100 deg. in the sun ; on one day it reached as high as 119'5—An exceedingly hot and dry month, with the temperature, in three of the weeks, 6. 8 and 10 deg. higher than the average of forty years; and the rainfall not quite one-fifth the usual amount: the air had also very little movement: this condition of things will account for the peculiar character of the mortality, and for the very just outcry as to the condition of the banks of the Thames. You may judge of the effect of such a temperature upon exposed dungheaps; wet, sloppy yards; and rotten filthy uncovered water butts; three characteristics of this Parish ; and how an unusually stagnant atmosphere allows the fetid exhalations to remain where they arise. It will also account for the exceedingly offensive effluvia spread of late far and wide from Green Street; and which our insufficient, I will not 6ay temporizing, measures have so far failed to amend in any very great degree. The report handed in some time since by the Committee of the Vestry, specially appointed for this purpose, would, in my opinion, if completely acted upon, have amended the evil. The Surgeon of the district writes thus in his weekly return to the Board of Guardians: " The smell is very bad from a horse boiling establishment in Green Street, which causes a great increase of sickness near that part." This of course refers to the bone boiling and other like establishments ; of which there are in this one small street, three Cat-Gut Manufacturers, one Soap Boiler, one Horse Slaughterer and four Bone Boilers, all very offensive Trades. I am receiving complaints in all directions as to this matter. I am inclined to think, that this is not altogether just to the 20,000 inhabitants who live within the effluvia circle of Green Street. While on meteorological subjects, I must note a peculiar quality of the oxygen of the atmosphere lately discovered, and which is called ozone. This substance has apparently the power of oxydizing, of purifying ; that is, of destroying putrefaction : it is more or less an electrical agent, and is usually discovered in large quantities on the outskirts of London ; for instance, Hackney and Fulham; and is, so to speak, almost all "used up" before it reaches the central districts; it is, we presume, absorbed in oxydizing the putrefactive effluvia of the inmost parts of the town: probably if we were careful to avoid unnecessary causes of foulness, 2 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. and to employ assiduously the ordinary means of cleanliness, this substance might be found efficient in making the London atmosphere healthy. In the fourth Table is seen the proportion of deaths in the different districts : in that of the Borough Road the mortality of the Workhouse is included, but as some of these cases come from the Kent and London Road districts, the true numbers will vary somewhat from those here represented, as thus—Kent Road, 99 ; London Road, 94 ; Borough Road, 103. The mortality and sickness, as this table shows, is much greater according to the population, in the Borough Road district, than in the others ; from several known causes, but chiefly from overcrowding. Here also are the particulars of 2535 cases of illness, 1341 of these attended by the Parish Surgeons, and 1042 at the Royal South London Dispensary. The last number represents a large number of poor persons not of this Parish ; but as a considerable number of our pnor are attended at the Surrey Dispensary, situated in a neighbouring Parish, and therefore not here noted ; the error is probably not great. Among others, are noted 148 cases of measles, 45 scarlet fever, 43 whooping cough, 134 diarrhcea and 81 fever; as against 13 measles, 13 scarlet fever, 49 whooping cough, 77 diarrhoea and 141 fever, recorded in the corresponding quarter last year: an excels on this quarter of 135 cases of measles, 32 scarlet fever, 57 diarrhoea, and less cases of fever by 60. Out of forty children in the Deaf and Dumb Asylum who had not had measles, fifteen took the disease. No case of fever has been received into the Fever Hospital from this Parish. I have had to make the same remark quarter after quarter. Fever cases were double what they are now when the Vestry was first instituted : there can be no doubt lhat the sanitary surveillance and cleansing of the poorest and sickliest districts must have had a great effect upon the class of diseases most affected by impurities. A purer atmosphere is in my opinion the grand requisite to avert or greatly to diminish all these diseases ; they fall chiefly upon the young; and the young in this Paiish are too much indoors in foul crowded and ill ventilated places, or in schools defective in sanitary requisites. Since the Vestry was first elected here, 1796 orders, chiefly for sanitary improvement, have been issued; and the work ordered is recorded as done in 1547 of these cases. No question, if the work so ordered had been done under inspection in the best manner, our sick and death list would be much less than it is ; great good however has been effected. Eight cases of small pox are recorded ; one, sent to the Small Pox Hospital: of late I have had no such cases to record ; small pox almost promises to die out: I have before reported as to the causes why the disease still exists here ; the supervision of vaccination is not in the proper hands ; it is not sufficiently pressed; nor is there a sufficient security that the operation is performed in the best manner-—the only death now recorded was in a child unvaccinated—the number of births was during the quarter 465 ; the number vaccinated by the appointed officers 263 only; the total number registered, about the same: 37 cases of illness and 68 of insanity are reported at Bethlehem Hospital; those of little import are not noticed: one feature noted here and elsewhere, probably from the hot and comparatively stagnant atmosphere, was, a remarkably debility even where actual disease was not produced: when such a disposition prevails, the character or type of disease is that, of want of power; this has been especially manifest in the diseases of children during this quarter: as a mere illustration I would observe that the most remarkable effects of ihis kind appeared in connection with the last great influenza epidemic; when people fainted and languished as they went about, and were totally prostrated in a few hours by slight disease. The fifth Table shows the sickness among the poor week by week in the respective districts, and a comparison of the totals with those of the corresponding quarter. I may remark here that as usual we received more than our share of poor stragglers at the Workhouse : 3101 " casuals" were admitted and relieved. During this quarter, by permission of the Guardians, I vifited the Mitcham establishment, and found the children there remarkably unhealthy—the total number averaged from St. George's, 240; and from Mile End whose children are farmed there, 200. Out of these 440, there were, one week, 145 ill; 130 of them with scrophulous diseases ; second week 90, third week 98, fourth w eek 110; of these 7 had itch, 97 scrophula, including 62 with bad eyes. The children were frequently sent from Mile End in a most filthy and neglected state, afflicted with itch and vermin. I was received most courteously by the Guardians and prompt measures were ordered. This does not come under the jurisdiction of the \estry, but I thought it right as the Medical Officer of Health of the Parish, to visit and note these things, and to offer my services to the Board of Guardians, and as your officer to report that I had done so. I now come to the sixth or mortality Table, here are recorded 296 deaths, wiih the particulars of sex, age and disease : in the margin are the numbers of deaths from corresponding diseases during the second quarter last year. The Zymotic deaths are one-fourth more, 81 to 60; 20 of the cases in excess were from one disease alone, measles. Darrhaaa and fever both, show a less mortality. Two of the deaths under the seventeenth head were from poison, Cyanide of Potassium, a chemical used in Photography. Twenty-five persons died aged over 70 years; II of these were males and 14 femalts ; 10 were widows, 17 of them aged people were very poor and died in the Workhouse or back streets. I have the usual story to tell, that more than half our deaths take place under 10 years of age j I am not enough of a visionary to expect that children shall not. die, that all premature deaths might be prevented ; but 167 ought not to be the proportion out of 296 ; this represents a very large number who yield but anxiety and expence, who inherit suffering and pass quickly Repr.rt of the Medical Officer of Health, for the Second Quarter, 1858. 3 through a blighted and unfulfilled life. I have often noted how this might be prevented ; it involves the absolute duty even at considerable exjtence, of making provision for open spaces to which children might be readily taken ; it involves also, all those other improvements by which pure and free air, pure water, good food and general cleanliness are favored and insured: when we consider that 2000 children are annually born in this Parish and that 600 of these die under 10 years of age, the question demands our favorable and earnest consideration ; it will not do in an enlightened age like this^ to pass it by as a fated or unavoidable evil. I confess I see but little difference between that sanguinary ancient law that directly destroyed weakly and deformed children, and that modern indifference that insures at the very least an equally fatal result. I reiterate this and vary the proofs, because 1 know that as yet there are many who do not believe, and more who are unwilling to believe these disturbing truths, involving as they undoubtedly do so much trouble and expence, and giving us painful reminders of new duties, as well as of old ones neglected. The last Table viz. 7, gives the particulars of the sanitary work of the quarter. It shows that 246 places have been noted as requiring improvement, and that in 122of these, the orders have not as yet been carried out (some few of course could not in the time): it shows also that 111 of the cases recorded in previous quarters the work is not carried out. I beg respectfully to suggest as I have suggested before, that the sanitary work of this Parish requires the exclusive care of one Inspector. Our officer has multifarious duties, of which these form only a part, and it is consequently impossible to insure the business being done in a business like manner. I have been obliged for several weeks past to postpone or altogether to pass by a large number of cases, at least 100, requiring improvement, because of the absolute impossibility of having them attended to. Nor must it be forgotten, as indeed is very natural, that a large number of those upon whom orders come, are objectors and not a few positive obstructors : this of course involves the necessity of a more complete and frequent supervision of all works ordered. The items in this last Table merit attention and throw a sad sort of light upon the condition of the Poor of this Parish. We have visited 73 unclean and ruinous houses; 118 in which the water was stored in a most unwholesome manner; 163 in which the drains were defective enough to be disease producing; 72 in which the water closets were more or less unfit for use; 110 yards sloppy, not paved or ill paved, and 138 in which there was no sufficient provision for house refuse; in these cases it is strewed about the yards ; hid in closets, under stairs, in rooms, or is thrown out into the streets after dark. A large amount of time is lost in a most irregular way of receiving dust complaints from all quarters, and in ordering and seeing that dust carts are dispatched every way at once if possible ; if, as I long since suggested, the carts were with perfect regularity to go in certain quarters on slated days, and always on those days and no others; if a signal, say the letter I> were directed to be placed in the window, where refuse required removal, and the inhabitants who neglected so easy a provision, and whose premises were found unwholesome in this respect, were made answerable, which according to the law could easily be done, then we might be clear of those enormous and numerous festering heaps of house refuse, all but universal in this Parish. The small fees demanded is a great difficulty, and yet it is almost impossible to get rid of so old a custom; the 2000 respectable nouses where they can afford to pay, may thus be cleared; but the 4000 or 5000 poor houses are neglected. I cannot but think the remedy for this evil lies here, to give an acknowledged substitute weekly in addition to each dustman, make the same known to the inhabitants, solicit information and suspend or dismiss any man found receiving money for removing dust. The present system wastes the Inspector's time, keeps him from more important duties and is most imperfect in execution. I have spoken to several people about the dust sign, and all thoroughly approve of this or any other plan that will rid them ofa constant nuisance: in one instance a householder attributed the more serious character of the illness of three of her family to the offensive refuse that week after week she could not get rid of; the carts of the next Parish passing all the time with daily and provoking regularity on the opposite side of the way. The Magistrate has decided in one case against overcrowding, a first and most important decision in this Parish; we are packing more and more closely—in 1821 there were in this Parish 129 persons to the acre; in 1831, 141 persons; in 1841, 165; in 1851, 184; and now there are 195 persons to the acre : in the great mass of our poorer habitations the allowance of breathing room is not more than 200 cubic feet per head, often as low as 120, a most insufficient and disease producing condition, that is about one-third the amount of air considered absolutely necessary for life and health, by the Poor Law and Police Commissioners and about a fifth of that allowed by the Gaol authorities. In one house reported to me there were 30 in four rooms with only 2410 cubic feet or 80 cubic feet per individual; this must of course be premature death to many of them. In Henry Street, the average inhabitants in four rooms with 2500 cubic feet of space is from 12 to 16 ; but my pressing these cases as they require is out of the question. We cannot overlook what is going on ; improvements are being effected elsewhere ; the dwellings of the poor are being destroyed; a few Parishes are fast becoming preeminently poor, overcrowded and filthy : I need not inform you that this Parish is one that gets, in this respect, steadily worse from the improvement in others. The temptation is very great to overcrowd; the poor family, however large, by crowding into one room, and by even taking a casual lodger in addition, obtains a sort of home at a cheaper rate; and the owner gets a much larger revenue out of what in courtesy to him I must I suppose call human habitations ; the resulting illness and death are considered inevitable or are viewed with a stolid indifference. 4 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. Your Inspector has in several instanses. reported to the Police as to dangerous structures, many have been taken down and very great improvements have been effected. The promptitude of the Police in these matters and their successful care as to the lodging houses is beyond all praise ; there are 25 lodging houses in this Parish capable of receiving 800 or 900 lodgers ; these places were formerly the very worst for fever and like diseases; they are now, even in the Mint and Kent Street among the most healthy places we have ; and this owing entirely to the care and wise surveillance under the provisions of the Lodging House Acts. The Inspector has several times seized unwholesome meat; very much is exposed for sale in this Parish; in one case the offender was fined £5 and the carcases destroyed ; in another, the meat was destroyed and a warning given. An Order in Council has been received to close the Church vaults and to do certain works under my supervision ; this will be done with the most respectful care ; that which is safe to be done in the hot weather, the Churchwardens have ordered to be done now, the remainder of the work ordered, will be done in the cold season. There can be no question as to the necessity of the work; complaints have been made occasionally of very fetid exhalations getting into the Church, and within this month people are stated to have gone out in consequence during the service; meetings have been driven from the Vestry by the foul gases coming up from below through openings direct from one place to the other—all this will be completely amended. The churchyard walls are very high and impede light and ventilation, in some close thickly populated courts ; it is a source of ill health; I have been in communication with the Churchwardens about it; the work can, as I understand, be done for the bricks alone, without any money cost—it is important, and I trust it will not be allowed to pass on unimproved. There are three or four petitioners from the High .Street against this improvement, but I think they cannot press their objection when they learn that more light, more air, and consequently health will be given to at least 300 people. In this Parish there are so many poor exceedingly bad conditioned unwholesome houses and poor owners, where the work of improvement should not the less go on ; of course as much as possible without oppressive action ; in such cases the provisions of the 216th sect. Local Management Act and of the 20th sect. Nuisances Removal Act for payment by instalments would materially lessen the grievance; and in some cases where a small property is owned by an exceedingly poor person, and the place is in the highest degree unwholesome, the work might be wisely done at I he public charge. The state of the water supply for the quarter is as follows, the impurities stated in grains per gallon :*— Lambeth Company. Southwark Company. TOTAL. ORGANIC. TOTAL. ORGANIC.

The water supply from the Lambeth Company's Works has become as you see gradually better, while that of the Southwark Company has become worse; in connection with this subject it must not be forgotten that the Lambelh Company has 4½ qcres of resorvoir for filtered water; and that the Southwark Company has no provision of the kind, and appears to have moreover the opportunity of admitting water at pleasure from a most unwholesome part of the river near Battersea: no question this Company ought to place itself beyond suspicion. We do not, however, come to this inquiry with clean hands; the comparatively good supply from the companies is vitiated by defective home arrangements; I have seen water in the butts in scores of cases during this hot weather, open, exposed to the full heat of the sun, warm, fermenting, containing vegetation and animalcule in abundance, utterly unfit for use. During the hottest of the weather the inhabitants of some of the densest districts, Etham, Henry and Westcoit Streets for instance, have suffered much from want of water on Sunday ; the people are to be seen going in all directions with saucepans and other utensils in search of water. I have had many complaints of this. I believe an increased supply in all poor neighbourhoods to be necessary. (Signed) WILLIAM RENDLE.

Corresponding Quarter of last Year 454 335 60 388 304 53 792 475 97 72 No. 10. Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Third Quarter, 1858. 25th October 1858. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen op the Vestrt, I have now to bring before you my eleventh quarterly report—I shall have to relate to you that two distinct epidemics have prevailed, and have together caused GO deaths during the quarter; I would I could say they had passed away. In your written instructions to me I am directed to ascertain the existence, especially of epidemics increasing the rate of mortality; to point out the existence of any nuisances or other local causes which tend to originate and maintain such diseases, and thus affect the health of the inhabitants: (thus as you see recognized as causes of epidemics, by your own body). I have brought before this Vestry and the Committee six ordinary and two special reports. I now come to the Tables.— The first shows a great increase of deaths in the quarter; far exceeding the mortality of any corresponding quarters since 1845; except 1849 and 1854; and they were the years of the great cholera epidemics: the mortality for the quarter just ended is 369; exceeding the last quarter by 73, and the corresponding quarter last year by 93. Reasonable work being ordered, every precaution should be taken, to have it well done, for the localities supposed to be improved, to which numberless visits have been paid, and about which a great deal of trouble has been taken, are turning up again and again, with new defects, as well as with o*d ones unremedied : epidemics soon find them out, they are recorded in the Medical Poor Law Officer's books and in the death reports of the Registrar General; tfke for instance Amelia Street, where several deaths are now occurring from malignant scarlet fever; pans were put, the cesspools appear to have been abolished;—they had better have been let alone: pipes were laid from the pans to a surface drain much nearer the houses ;—a loose stone or wood covers it, it has little slope and no bottom, so that scarcely anything can run off: I easily pushed a stick 18 inches down ; the sides are old bricks so far apart that I could put the stick between; I saw the night soil there, it appears to remain, tainting the air and saturating the soil; from one closet the soil oozes to the surface ;—no wonder Ihe woman who has lost two children complains of the stench in summer coming into the back parlour,—that at No. I where another child is dead, they smell the privy and drain in the house, especially when the water comes on and stirs up the cesspool, and that when the house is shut up, it smells very bad indeed ;—it cannot be otherwise, the night soil saturates the ground. Touching the cesspools—You hesitate to 6end away the corruption which so increases our mortality, and which a warmer, drier, and less windy season has not failed to develope into active sources of disease : at this end of the sewers where the cesspools are, these emanations are death, at least 159 the number of deaths this quarter more or less connected with putridity as a cause, tells us so. 1 am very far from saying that the Thames is the best place to send our sewage ; but while we hesitate, our children die by scores; and our working population become emaciated, in houses where these smells meet us at the front door. Who can gainsay that it is best to send the filth to be so diluted by the immense flow of waters there, that although, perhaps productive of slight sickness, it is probably robbed of its death-producing power, than to keep it here to arouse up the perpetually recurring and fatal pestilence. Let us see what the sewage does in the river and what it does here; I quote from papers issued weekly, from government offices: July 10th "no case of any importance has come under' treatment among the Custom-house officers, of whom 800 are always on the river and 500 on its 2 • Parish af Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. banks"—this week 99 died in the south districts of Zymotic disease and 10 in this Parish. July 17th "the sanitary state of the Dreadnought good"—this week 95 died in the south districts of Zymotic disease, 11 of them in this Parish. July 31st "a case of fever, the second only in 18 months on board the Dreadnought"—" General health of Custom-house staff good "— this week 11'2 deaths from Zymotic disease in the south districts, of which 9 were in this Parish, including the first in Cornbury Street. August 7th, "smells from cesspools south side of river, described at present as most noxious"—deaths from Zymotic disease in the south districts 101 ; 15 of them in this Parish—the second death in Cornbury Street. August 14tli, " sanitary condition of Dreadnought Hospital ship satisfactory"—this week 91 deaths, Zymotic disease, south districts, 13 of them in this Parish, including 2 more in Cornbury Street. September 18th, the last week in which a death occurred in this street, only one case of diarrhoea is recorded among 1300 Custom-house officers about the Thames—Is not this proof enough, that at the cesspool end of the sewers, pestilence occurs, and death; and that at the river end of the sewers no very appreciable evil is produced; and there are these other facts : that cesspools are not only close to the houses, but mostly the waste water and the contents of the drains run into them, and daily stir them up: nothing is more common, than to hear " they smell dreadful when the water comes on :" I have often reported it here, but the very enormity of the evil blunts our appreciation of it. Again, these cesspools are not nearly so often emptied as they were ; those who are about in the night tell me that the night-cart is not often used ; you yourselves see that some goes into the sewers by the hose and pump: your perpetually agitated cesspool also runs off into the sewers, that is into the Thames, how ? builders and owners of small property tell me of one of the vilest contrivances which can possibly be brought near to houses ; viz., overflow pipes which keep this mischief alive : this was the case in several houses where disease has most raged ; the refuse, after being well stirred up near the houses, actually flows into the Thames ; but it produces death at one end, in addition to a possible sickness at the other: happily, as I am informed, the owners in Cornbury Street have themselves filled up the pits and remedied the evil. Now Manchester has been put before you as an example of how well cesspools may be made to act, and I have no doubt the presumed example of this spirited city, had something to do with your conclusion, that no more cesspools should be abolished here, except upon appeal to the Vestry. Now cesspools ought to work better there than here with the craving fields so near at hand ; but you will be surprised to learn that the facts run quite the other way. The annual mortality in this Parish returned in the Registrar-General's last report is 30 in 1000 living; in Manchester it is 33: we should lose 150 more by death every year if we were as unhealthy as Manchester: the cesspool system there, is therefore (with other matters) not healthy; and apparently in consequence a private act paid for by the Corporation of Manchester themselves, and which might fairly be called an act to encourage the construction of water-closets in Manchester, was passed last session, encouraging the formation of water-closets and empowering the Corporation to supply them with water and to charge for it: to encourage it, the Corporation is in some matters not to charge beyond the actual cost, and due check is provided against waste of water (a provision much wanted here), and bad construction of pipes, &c., leading from water-closets. Referring in my last report to the second Table, I stated that we had then improved more than other Parishes there noted ; we now take our old place again ; we are once more, I believe, the worst in London.

On the whole there have been only 48 births more than deaths— 131 worse than the average of the last five quarters. The third Table shows the progress week by week of Zymotic and other disease, side by side with the meteorological condition of this locality : measles was unusually fatal during the first eight weeks—diarrhoea with some variation up to the last week—typhus at the beginning ana end of the quarter—scarlet fever the last nine weeks. The existence of these epidemics, will plead as an excuse for my troubling you at some length on this my only sufficientopportunity. Putrid complaints are undoubtedly very fatal among us, and each week brings news of their progress typhus does not abate ; sc irlet fever, measles, complications known as diphtheria, sore throat, and the like, increase ; two cases of a very rare complaint, known as cancrum oris, of a still more Report of the Medical Officer of Health, for the Third Quarter, 1858. 3 putrid nature, have now occurred in the Mint; these complaints affect localities where putrid emanations arise with all their usual disease-producing accompaniments: they concentrate, become more putrid, and then shift their seat to some other spot more or less favorable to the untoward influences. Here is of course a responsibility, which brings us into contact not only with the sufferers in our own bad streets and alleys, but when such disease overflows into other Parishes, and by a growing intensity spreads from town to town, as its custom is, especially when invited, we may even stand as the careless originators of deaths beyond our district and beyond our knowledge. The back districts of this Parish require relief as much as Ireland ever did from a class of middle-men, who with some few most honourable exceptions, grind out nil they can from the squalid districts, and carry nothing back in the way of cleanliness or improvement: it would be well if the great landlords would themselves occasionally see the neglected condition of the places so underlet. In a circle about the Parish church, there have been three deaths from typhus and four from an equivalent disease, typhoscarlatina; one of them in May-Pole Alley, a place no epidemic ever misses, and which is now fast retrogressing towards all its original filth and unwholesomeness ; indeed the work so often ordered, has never been really done :—two from typhus and scarlet fever in Wilmott's Buildings; a place closely inhabited and inclosed with high walls; it is well known that these diseases occur in overcrowded places just such as this. In a circle about Mint Street, comprising Lant Street, William Street, &c., have occurred, one death from scarlet fever, nine from measles, seven from diarrhoea; this locality is improving and the deaths are much fewer than formerly. About Kent Street and its tributary streets and courts have occurred two deaths from typhus, seven from scarlatina, seven from measles, seven from diarrhoea : comprised in this are St. George's New Town recently built, badly drained, and much neglected—Hunter and Rephidim Streets—Paul's Yard, the house in which two deaths are reported is tainted with privy and drain smells from a foul cesspool and is now before you for remedy : in the Government report on the sanitary condition of the epidemic districts (so they are called) in St. George's, Southwark, 1852; Henry Street, Hunter Street, Paul's Yard, Potier Street, and Noel's Court are noted as places remarkably unhealthy: Westcott, Henry, and Etham Streets show one death from scarlatina, three from measles, and four from diarrhoea: the names of these streets are familiar to us as sources of disease and of great expense to the Parish—filth, deficiency of water, bad storage, and streets so constructed as to allow of little healthy current are the characteristics which have been often noted, as yet without real remedy. About the Kent Road I count fifteen deaths from typhus and scarlatina, one from measles, two from diarrhoea: nine of them took place in Cornbury Street where we recognize the drain and privy smells as causes of the malignancy of the fever; two in Northampton Street where the small-pox attacked so many last April, and where now five more deaths are recorded from scarlatina; Amelia Street, previously mentioned, where fever was fatal some few months ago, thirteen cases have now occurred of scarlatina and diphtheria and four of them are now dead: one at Mina Cottages, where, on a late visit, I found 147 persons living by what the Government report already cited calls "a stinking ditch," many of them taking their water from a pump by the side of it or from rotten butts,—where they have no drains but the open ditch and no privies but those which stand over it About Green Street as a centre I find ten deaths from diarrhoea and two from measles; diarrhoea has been far more fatal here than elsewhere, and now malignant scarlatina is appearing; in one respectable house two fine-giown children are dead ; the place is clean and the drains good, but the house is so situated, as frequenily to receive the full current of air, loaded with putrifying particles and deleterious gases from Green Street; the two previous occupants lost the one, two children the other three, and they all, I am informed, complain of this only. I find three deaths from diarrhoea in Martin Street; the father of one significantly, but not quite correctly, told me " they always die of diarrhoea here;'"—this street has always been peculiarly liable to this kind of disease and is so • i noted in the report cited; the houses are many of them damp and the gronnd appears to be ' saturated from old drains and cesspools. In Gray Street, of which I have now had notice, through the Registrar General's papers and the district surgeon's book, are five cases, four of them dead— in the most of all these cases 1 find defects sufficient in my opinion to convert an ordinary disease into one more severe; and in many, the sources of positive putridity. It may perhaps be said that all this is in the order of nature, and cannot be prevented; my experience of a quarter of a century among these diseases points quite the other way. Providence does not intend that reservoirs of stinking, putrid matter shall stand so close to the poor man's door, as to infest him at bed and at board ;—truly some of these diseases may come by other agencies, and may happily give immunity for the future ; but when they enter a foul district then it is they become deadly ; and these epidemics now visiting us, point to this truth in a remarkable manner : be it understood that 1 use the name of Providence in these reports with the utmost veneration and care ; I would . not be thought to use the Divine Authority lightly, and for the support of any argument that might occur. In the Jewish Scriptures the places for the purposes here mentioned are ordered to "be without the camp as far from the breathing and eating place as possible ; and among us, as yon see, when we tolerate such abominations—He visits us with death : it is the result of the irrevocable laws of nature, often averted by what appear as happy accidents, but at last when disregarded, deadly. Gentlemen, you are the trustees for life and death to a population of well nigh 30,000 people, who from the force of circumstances,are more or less unable to help themselves. 4 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. The fourth Table contains the mortality in districts: here also are recorded the particulars of'2831 cases of illness; 1637 of them among the poor attended by the Parish surgeons; 1071 at the Royal South London Dispensary, and 123 in other Institutions, the Medical Officers of which have been so obliging as to favor me with returns — I have especially to thank Mr. Hentsch of the Dispensary for regular weekly returns : as a contrast with our poorer districts you will perceive that none of these Institutions show any serious illness, although it surrounds them almost to the very gates; chiefly among the poor, where bad sanitary arrangements and bad habits prevail: this shows, if anything can, how much of our sickness is in the power of man to mitigate or prevent: of course it cannot be expected that we can provide the homes of the' poor with the orderly arrangements and benefits of these Institutions; that however will form no excuse here or hereafter, for not carrying out the improvements we can easily achieve, and which a wise legislature has given us full authority to do. The fifth Table refers to the poor, and shows the progress of sickness among them week by week : 3101 persons have been relieved as casuals for the quarter ending Midsummer, and 2805 the quarter ending Michaelmas: this is as usual given as an evidence of a larger influx of poor to this parish, than can by any means be considered as belonging to it, and which influx if considered in all its bearings leads to cost, to overcrowding, and by consequence to ill health, necessarily to overcrowding, for the demand for houses of the poorest class far exceeds the supply. The sixth Table, gives as usual particulars of every death during the quarter, the increase on the corresponding one is shown to be 93, of which 55 is from two diseases alone, measles and scarlatina. An unusually heavy mortality is shown among the young—249 out of369—2 out of every 3—this state of things is held to be a good measure of the good or bad condition of a locality, as the young are more constantly exposed to the prevailing influences. The experience of the last 7 quarters shows that of 3395 born in this parish, 1'273, considerably more than one-third do not reach 20 years of age. Of births 417 are recorded, 217 have been vaccinated by the officers appointed, 163 only have been returned to the registrars as successfully vaccinated. The slaughter houses, 34 in number have as usual been visited this quarter, 2 only did not obtain their licenses: The seventh Table records the sanitary work.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Fourth Quarter, 1858. 28th February, 1859. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Vestry, In consequence of illness, the production of this, my twelfth quarterly report, has been unavoidably delayed. I have during the quarter brought before your Committee four ordinary reports. I will now proceed, as usual, to comment on the tables. The first shows a steady increase in the deaths as compared with the other quarters of the same year, as well as with the corresponding quarters of different years, in fact the quarter now under review approaches somewhat remotely to those of the great fatal epidemics. The second, or table of contrast, shows this, that Newington has suffered more in absolute mortality than the others, that this parish and St. Giles's, have suffered the next after Newington about equally, and that the other parishes have been more favoured. Newington has also suffered most from scarlet fever, and we stand next. In my last quarterly report I had to speak of one very unfavourable sign, the great decrease in the excess of births over deaths; I have to speak more favourably as to this point, but we show a decrease of about 50 on the quarter. We, in common with other parishes, have suffered severely from an epidemic of scarlet fever. I have therefore added a column for this disease. The third table gives, as usual, the mortality, week by week during the quarter: certain classes of disease are here particularized; and opposite each week is the usual record of meteorological conditions. You will here see that the mortality in seven of the thirteen weeks was considerably above the average of the corresponding weeks of the last 10 years. In the fourth table is recorded the relative mortality in the districts. The largest increase is shewn in the Kent Road District. The Borough Road District, in which the greatest amount of real sanitary improvement has been effected, still shows a relatively decreasing mortality—with scarcely an exception, the places visited by diptheria and scarlet fever are the same places so long recognized as defective in the common-sense sanitary requisites. I may mention May-Pole Alley, 2 Parish af Saint George the Martyr, Southwards. Thomas Street, Northampton Street, Hunter Street, Amelia Street, Wickham Gardens, Lansdowne Place and Paul's Yard—with respect to Amelia Street, reported upon last quarter, the inhabitants on the east side themselves complain of the offensive and damp condition of their places, and they remark that death has been busy among them, and that the opposite side of this narrow street, where we some time since insisted upon sound sanitary improvement, has altogether escaped; they cannot help connecting the immunity with the improvement. I believe their remarks to be just, and that they have reason to complain. One the one side they have some cesspools and a rotten drain near the surface and near the houses, and the houses are often damp within. Here 8 deaths have occurred from scarlet fever and diptheria. On the other side of the street referred to as having entirely escaped, certain orders were made, I copy the following from the inspector's book and the work is reported to have been well done. The complaint was of foul and offensive cesspools, defective drains, untrapped sinks, and houses smelling very offensively—serious illness then resulted, and the order made was to empty and fill up cesspools, to connect by pipe drain with sewer, to put proper pans and syphon traps, and lay on a sufficient water supply to closets; to trap all sinks, and erect covered dust bins. These proceedings have probably saved many lives on the west side of Amelia Street. In the face of so many deaths from putrid disease on the east or foul side of Amelia Street, and the immunity from death on the side where good work was done, I have not been able to prevail upon your Committee to order prompt and efficient work, and I believe your quasi order* that no more cesspools should be filled up was pleaded as the reason. My voice will soon be hushed here, but I once more protest that this is unintentionally perpetuating an unnatural and excessive mortality. In this 4th table are recorded the particulars of 2613 cases of illness. I have omitted the fifth table altogether. I have for a long time past been obliged to take averages for one of the poor districts, the returns being irregular. In their present conditiou they are of no value to your Officer of Health; but as the poor-law officers can be of the greatest service to the Officer of Health, I beg to advise a more complete concert with the Board of Guardians upon this point. The sixth table contains, as usual, the particulars of disease, sex and age, and the mortality from each specified cause during the corresponding quarter last year. The zymotic mortality is 97 as against 56—from lung diseases 102 as against 89—from scarlatina and diptheria 45 as against 10—measles 12 in excess—233 of the 375 deaths took place in persons below 20 years of age, and 220 under 10. The deaths from violence and privation are less 5 as against II, the corresponding quarter; but I could swell this last list considerably, for I consider that no death that we can prevent really takes place from the visitation of God so much as by the culpable neglect of man, and these may all be called violent deaths. And now I come to the last or seventh table, which contains a rather rough catalogue of our sanitary work. I have already shown that our mortality increases, and that the deaths, in which the principal increase is shown, are those considered by our wisest and most practical men as more or less preventable, more or less connected with bad local causes; as this appears to me without doubt to be so (and I have had 20 years experience and bias for the study to guide me), I may ask, with some reason, what are we doing to improve the sanitary condition of our very unhealthy parish P and this seventh table gives the answer, and a very unsatisfactory one it is. * Note appended by order op Vestry " The Vestry has not passed any order whatever preventing the filling up of cesspools, but has merely ordered that none be directed to be filled up without the order of the Vestry. Report of the Medical Officer of Health., for the Fourth Quarter, 1858. 3 Let me premise that in my sixth quarterly report 211 houses are recorded in which sanitary action was taken, and 88 were improved. Seventh quarter 227 houses are reported and 137 were improved. Eighth „ 323 „ „ 189 „ Ninth „ 137 ,, ,, 65 ,, „ Tenth „ 246 „ „ 122 Eleventh „ 196 „ „ 60 „ „ And now in the face of all this grevious sickness and largely increased death rate, the number of places in which sanitary action is only 67 (223 is our average) and 29 of this 67 are old cases revived, in which the work ordered to be done has apparently been evaded. About 165 places are recorded in this table, in which the work ordered has not been done, and many of these appear to be of long standing. I could wish the provisions for collecting dust and house refuse, especially among the poor, to be more systematic and effective. I believe as much is done as can be under the present very defective mode. The number of births recorded is 498. The Poor-Law Officers have vaccinated 127, and 159 have been recorded by the Registrars; now allowing for a considerable number of infant deaths, &c. we may yet presume that vaccination is very much neglected and as smallpox epidemics are in some parts of the country, it is a matter to be looked to. I beg as usual to append the report connected with our water supply, for which I am indebted to Dr. Thomson. Lambeth Company. Southmark Company. TOTAL IMPURITY. ORGANIC IMPURITY • TOTAL IMPURITY.
