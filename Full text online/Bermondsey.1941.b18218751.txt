To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Bermondsey. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1941. There have been a number of changes in the staff during the year, but the department has continued to carry out its functions, I believe, to the satisfaction of the Council. Meetings of the Committees with which the department is mainly concerned have been held with almost their normal peace-time frequency, and I wish, once again, to express my appreciation of the help received from both Committees and especially of the kindness of the Chairmen. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, D. M. CONNAN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. AREA. The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres. POPULATION.

As in previous years the District Nurses have been asked to visit many of our patients who are suffering from Tuberculosis, and are being treated at home; 813 visits were paid by the nurses in 1941. A limited provision is made for the supply of extra nourishment to tuberculous persons, and this usually takes the form of eggs and milk; 74 patients received help in this way during the year. The scheme for the provision of shelters has been continued, and 2 shelters are at present in use. LADY ALMONER. The Lady Almoner has a variety of duties which are concerned chiefly in the after-care of tuberculous patients. She arranges for assistance to be given to patients in a number of different ways, as for instance in the supply of extra nourishment, the provision of beds, bedsteads and nursing utensils. In a few cases she has been able to arrange for a period of rest in a convalescent home, or for a country holiday in the case of exhausted mothers. She regularly visits the homes of patients who are undergoing treatment in sanatoria in order to keep the relatives informed as to the patients' progress, and to see that proper provision is made for the patients' return. In addition to these duties the Lady Almoner acts as Child Protection Visitor under Part XIII of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. RETURN SHOWING THE WORK OF THE DISPENSARY DURING THE YEAR 1941.

During the year the total number of patients who attended was 278, of these 96 were new patients. There is a marked increase in the number of patients attending with minor disabilities of the menopause. Many of these only require an examination and can then be reassured that the symptoms of which they complain have no serious significance; some require miner treatment which may be carried out at the clinic; or the patient may be referred to her own doctor. Sometimes hospital treatment is required, and the patient is referred to a suitable department of a hospital. Four cases of carcinoma were seen ,and of these three were in an early stage of the disease and were able to be cured by operation. There is also an increase in use being made of the clinic by women with menstrual irregularities. Most of these cases are referred by their own doctor for such complaints as dysmenorrhœa and sterility. FOOT CLINIC. Attendances during the year are shown in the following table:- Clinic Men Women Total Bermondsey 1,463 3,602 5,065 891 Rotherhithe 1,952 2,843 Totals 2,354 7,908 5,554 VIII.—PROPAGANDA. During the year under report the following lectures and demonstrations, illustrated by cinema films, were given in the Borough:— No. Attendance. Public Air Raid Shelters 127 14,250 Civil Defence Personnel 36 2,350 Lectures on First Aid 11 532 Others 31 1,900 205 19,032 As in previous years no opportunity was missed of giving lectures and demonstrations to the public. We were able to carry out a good deal of work in the public air-raid shelters and 127 visits were paid. Health films were shown as a part of a general programme of entertainment which, in most cases, was arranged by the Bermondsey Shelter Council with whom we are working in close co-operation. During the year training in film showing was given to a number of the most suitable men in the Civil Defence Services, and it was with their assistance that a successful year's programme was completed. Unfortunately, most of them have since gone into the Services or to other work, but, during the time they were with us, they did some very useful work. We have been enabled to assist the Ministry of Information by showing their films to shelterers and Civil Defence personnel, and, in fact, to any available audience. Towards the end of the year we commenced showing a series of interest and instructional —including, of course, hygiene —films to the boys' club in the Borough, as part of the Youth Movement Scheme. IX.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION HOUSING. During the year 1941, no areas were represented or declared by the Council. Four cottages were erected on the Adams Gardens Estate, Brunei Road, during the year. HOUSING ACT, 1936 —OVERCROWDING. It is impossible to give any reliable figures relative to overcrowding, owing to repeated changes in the occupation of houses. Many families have been evacuated, have moved out of the district privately, or have been provided with accommodation by the London County Council on outlying estates. ERADICATION OF BED BUGS.
