Applications have been made for the drainage of 702 houses, upon which £1,350 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by the applicants is £5000, which has been executed under the inspection and general supervision of the Officers of the Vestry. New Buildings. The Vestry have received notices for building 638 new houses, the drainage of which, and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the Sewers, have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. 53 Applications made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred by the Vestry and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given to the formation of 19 New Streets. 6 STATEMENT OF NEW WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS.

During the past year 50 memorials and applications have been received for increase of Lighting in various parts of the Parish; 40 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new lamps, or removal of others to more desirable positions; and 10 were rofused. There have been 74 new lamps erected and 15 removed to positions which increased their utility. The total number of lamps lighted by the Vestry is 2,756; and the cost of lighting, for the year ending the 25th March, 1870, including the erection of new columns, removals, &c., amounts to £12,088 17s. 3d. A reduction in the price of supply made by the Phoenix Gas Company will be a saving of £90 and upwards to the Parish. The Chemical Examiner has made monthly reports of his experiments with the Photometer, shewing that the supply equals the Parliamentary Standard, as regards Illuminating power, and that it is free from impurities, excepting that of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, which on seven occasions showed traces of Ammonia. Examination at the testing-houses of the various Companies have also been satisfactory, which is shewn in the following tabular Statement, furnished by Dr, Puckle, the Chemical Examiner: — 9 RESULT OF 1840 OBSERVATIONS OF THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THE GAS Made on 92 occasions, during the Year 1869—70.

It is satisfactory to find that there has been no increase in the general Mortality, or of disease during 1 869. Notwithstanding the depression of trade and want of employment amongst the working classes, and the privations consequent thereupon, the health of the Poor as indicated by the Cases of Illness arising from Epidemic Diseases attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers, shows an improvement amounting to nearly 40 per cent amongst that Class, compared with the proceeding year. For the first time. I have to record a slight dimunition in the Births registered in Lambeth, 7072 against 7871 in 1868, or 191 less during the Year. But it must bo borne in mind that 1868 comprised 53, instead of 52 weeks; with this exception, the number of births in 1869 exceeded those of any previous year. The Births in the first quarter of 1869 were 2056, in the second quarter 1753; in the third quarter 1975; and in the fourth quarter 1888. The Deaths recorded in the year were 4374, the excess of Births over Deaths being 3298; in 1868, the births exceeded the deaths by 3426; in 1867 by 3334; and in 1866 by 2914. In the first, quarter of 1869, the deaths numbered 1241; in the second quarter 992; in the third quarter 965; and in the last quarter 1173. J ho births and deaths during each quarter of the Year in 11 each of the Eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish are shown in Table II, from which it will be seen, that in the Waterloo Road 1st part district, there were 560 births, and 308 deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road 2nd part district, 944 births, and 417 deaths; in the Lambeth Church 1st part district, 762 births, and 417 deaths; in the Lambeth Church 2nd part district, 1589 births, and 1106 deaths, 370 of which occurred in the Workhouse; in the Kennington 1st part district, 1379 births, and 816 deaths; in the Kennington 2nd part district, 936 births, and 177 deaths; in the Brixton district, 1086 births, and 559 deaths; and in the Norwood district, 446 births, and 214 deaths, 8 of which occurred in the Children's Workhouse. The comparitive Mortality of Lambeth, the entire Metropolis, and the South District, of which Lambeth forms a large part is shown in Table III, which also gives the increased Population of each of the Divisions of the Parish, upon which the death-rate of each is calculated. This Table has been calculated on the rate of increase which took place between the censuses of the Years 1851 and 1861, and which for the sake of uniformity, and in the absence of a present knowledge of the actual population, I have continued to employ, although at a distance of nine years from the last census it can only be considered as matively correct. In some Districts of the Parish the population has certainly increased much more rapidly, this remark especially applies to the Kennington 2nd part and Brixton Districts, which are therefore really still more healthy than appears from this Table. The Mortality of Lambeth continues to compare favourably with that of the whole Metropolis, and also of the Southern District of which it forms a part. The Mortality of the whole of London being at the rate of 244 per ten thousand, of the estimated inhabitants, that of the Southern District 242 per ten thousand inhabitants, and of Lambeth 239 per ten thousand 12 inhabitants. The most healthy districts of Lambeth daring tho year being the Norwood, and the Waterloo Road 1st part districts, the mortality of both being at the rate of only 189 per ten thousand inhabitants; that of the Lambeth Church 1st part district being 198 per ten thousand inhabitants; that of the Kennington 2nd part, 219 per ten thousand; that of the Brixton district 221 per ten thousand; that of the Kennington 1st part 230 per ten thousand; that of the Waterloo Road 2nd part 237 per ten thousand; and that of the Lambeth Church 2nd part district 347 per ten thousand, or excluding tho Workhouse situate in this district, 238 per ten thousand inhabitants. By the same Table is also shown that one person amongst every forty living, died in London during the year; one amongst forty-one living, died in the South District, and in the whole of Lambeth; one amongst fifty-two living, died in the Norwood and Waterloo Road 1st districts; one amongst fifty, in tho Lambeth Church 1st part; one amongst forty-five in the Kennington 2nd part, and Brixton districts; one amongst forty-three, in the Kennington 1st part; one amongst forty-two, in the Waterloo Road 2nd part; and one amongst twenty-eight in the Lambeth Church 2nd part district. The deaths from Epidemic Diseases during 1869 are shown in Table IV, they amounted to 919, and were in the proportion of 21 per cent of the entire Mortality; in the previous year they were nearly 22½ per cent of the whole Mortality. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea were 223, from Whooping Cough 215, from Scarlet Fever 204, from Fever (including Typhus) 117, from Measles 116, from Small Pox and Diptheria each 22. Amongst this Class of Diseases, the Deaths from Scarlet Fever show an increase compared with the previous year. The deaths from Whooping Cough and Diptheria were almost the same as in 1868, and the deaths from Diarrhoea, Fever (including Typhus), Measles, and Small Pox were all less. 13 Notwithstanding an increase in the deaths from Scarlet Fever, the returns of the Registrar General show that had the same rate of Mortality from that cause occurred in Lambeth, as throughout tho rest of the whole Metropolis, the deaths from Scarlet Fever would have been 62 per cent greater than actually took place; the deaths from it in Lambeth having been at the rate of 112 per 10,000 of the population, and throughout the whole Metropolis at the rate of 183 per 10,000 inhabitants. Turning from the deaths from Epidemic Diseases occurring amongst the entire population of Lambeth, to the Cases of Illness from Epedimic Diseases arising amongst the Poor during the year, and attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers as set forth in Table V. it will be seen that the number of Cases of Illness so attended amounted to 805, of which 169 arose in the first quarter of the year, 181 in the second quarter, 310 in the third quarter, and 235 in the fourth quarter. There were 362 Cases of Diarrhoea, 181 of Measles, 161 of Scarlet Fever, 92 of Whooping Cough, 57 of Small Pox, and 42 of Fever, including Typhus. Of these the greatest number of Cases of Small Pox occurred in the first and second quarter of the year, of Measles in the second and fourth quarter, of Scarlet Fever in the third and fourth quarter, of Whooping Cough in first and second quarter, of Fever (including Typhus ) in the first and fourth quarter, and of Diarrhoea in the third quarter of the year. There was a great diminution in the number of Cases amongst the Poor, compared with the previous year; the number attended being only 895 in in 1869, against 1409 in 1868. A large decrease occurred in every form of Epidemic Disease amongst them, which must be considered very satisfactory. The Sanitary Work effected is set forth in Table I, which shows the Number and Nature of Nuisances brought under the Notice of the General Purposes Committee, with the results and Sanitary Improvements carried out. 14 The Nuisances Removed or Abated and Sanitary Improvements effected, amounted to 3156, irrespective of Slaughterhouses, Cow-houses, Bake-houses, &c., frequently whitewashed, and a number of Cases of unwholesome Fish,&c., condemned and destroyed. The Nuisances removed or abated, comprised 464 dirty houses, cleansed and whitewashed; 120 dilapidated houses repaired; 82 infected houses cleansed and disinfected; 182 houses with bad drainage, drained; 152 cesspools emptied or abolished; 430 obstructed drains remedied; 33 privies and closet drains improved; 152 defective drains trapped; 76 yards paved and improved; 77 houses provided with ventilation; 170 water receptacles improved; 105 houses provided with water supply; 383 dustbins erected; 88 dangerous structures removed; 4 trade nuisances abated; 4 smoke nuisances remedied; 14 offensive smells in houses from dampness abated; 13 obstructed gullies, and 18 foul urinals cleansed; 570 accumulations of dung, garbage, &c., removed; and 19 lots of swine, consisting of 88 pigs, removed. There were 19 lots of unsound and unwholesome Fish condemned and destroyed, consisting of 852 Plaice, 164 Mackerell, 200 Haddocks, 180 Soles, 80 Herrings, 60 Whiting, and 20 Skate. Also 3 lots of unsound and unwholesome Vegetables, consisting of 26 dozen of Cauliflowers, &c., were condemned and destroyed. In one case where unwholesome fish was exposed for sale, the Magistrate inflicted a fine of Two Pounds Nine shillings. For the removal of Nuisances and accomplisment of Sanitary Work 1809 Notices were required to be served, and 52 Summonses at the Police Courts, and Orders issued. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There were 111 Applications for Licenses for Slaughter-houses, of which 108 were renewals. Two new Applications for Licenses 15 were objected to at the Sessions, and the Licenses refused. All the Slaughter-lionsese were whitewashed several times. Two Butchers were Summoned during the year for Slaughtering on their premises without a license; One was fined Ten shillings and costs, and the other One Pound and costs. COWHOUSES. There were 94 Applications for Licenses for Cowhouses, of which 86 were renewals. Two new Applications for Licenses were objected to, and the Licenses refused. All the Cowhouses were whitewhashed several times. BAKEHOUSES. The Bakehouses were Inspected, 215 in number, and those which required whitewhashing were attended to, without the necessity of serving a formul Notice. WORKSHOPS. The Workshops Regulation Act received attention and 102 Workshops were visited under its provisions. At three Workrooms, viz.,— a Dressmaker's, a Toymaker's, and a Burr and Washer Maker's, Children under thirteen years of age were found employed for a longer period daily than permitted by the Act, and also not attending School. In each Case being the first time the premises were visited, a caution only was given. Also at three other Workrooms, viz., two Dressmaker's and a Mantlemaker's Women were found employed beyond the proper hours; in these instances also, a caution only was given. In one other Case a Mantlemaker was fined Three Pounds and Costs for employing Women beyond the proper hours, I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE PUCKLE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.
