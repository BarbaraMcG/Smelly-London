They regret to have to refer to the outbreak of Cholera during the tumn of the past year, inasmuch as that the attempts made to check its pogress have entailed a large amount of cost on the District, and which increase the rates of the ensuing year; but they yet believe that energetic action of the Board, taken immediately upon the first earance of that scourge, tended to crush out and remove it in a very short from amongst them : they refer to the valuable report of their Medical officer of Health, published herewith, for further information on the subject. Pursuant to the Act, under which they are incorporated, they have pubfced herewith an Abstract of the Audited Accounts, a statement of the Assets and Liabilities, together with the Auditors' Certificate; also a list of Antracts entered into during the year ; and the Eleventh Annual Report the Medical Officer of Health on the Sanitary Condition of the District. 6 Abstract of Contracts entered into BY THE Board DURING the YEAR ending 25th MaRCH, 1867.

(Signed) THOMAS DURRAN, JAMES H. GREEN, ward Room, Broadway House, May 21st, 1867 FULHAM DISTRICT THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, Of no period since the existence of your Board as the Loc: Authority has it been of more importance seriously to take a review of Sanitary condition than of that for the year which has just passed by. F eleven years the public Health of the Fulham District has been under you control, and though outbreaks of diseases of special type have from time time occurred, still no very serious consequences to the public welfare hav thence resulted. But the year to which this my eleventh Annual Repor particularly refers has been marked by one of those speeial visitations whici in former times have left for years their mark imprinted on the public burthens. Cholera has been here but without the wonted terror and dlsma amongst the p«oplo which have always hitherto marked its advent and course. The measures of prevention so promptly recognized by your Board a necessary, were equal to the occasion, and my special report thereon testifies the value of what was done. The Power of Sanitary arrangements to checi the progress of such a formidable disease was clearly evidenced, and public sacrifice beyond the moment has been entailed. Such a fact indeed matter for congratulation. The character for healthfulness of the Western Districts of the Metropolis is still maintained, and the Registrar-General in his Annual Summary for 1866 says, " The Mortality of London was above the average in nearly all except the West and South Districts." He furthei gives a table " showing the mortality in the several districts under the Metropolitan Board, which is entrusted with carrying out the drainage and other public works for improving the health of London. The results deserve careful study. They measure the efficiency of local administration." From this it appears that of the 38 Districts into which the Metropolitan Area divided the rate of mortality has been greater in 24 than in the Fulham District, less in 10, and about equal in 3. The total mortality of London has been 80,129, that of the Fulham District 1,149. The rate of mortality for London 2.6 per cent., that of the Fulham District 2.4 per cent. The estimated population of London in 1866 was 3,037,991; that of the Fulham District 48,657 so that the former had increased its number of 9 in habitants by 234,002, the latter by 8,599 since the census of 1861. This normous accession to the Metropolitan population in all probability will be found to have occurred specially in the suburban districts, and there is little doubt that the Fulham District has received its full share. At the census of 811 the population of the Fulham District was only 13,296, of which Hamaersmith contained 7,393, and Fulham 5,903. The resources, however, of both parishes in this direction are now almost Unlimited if properly directed and controlled. Large tracts of land admirably adapted for building purposes lie within hem, and the sound of the bricklayer's trowel may almost everywhere be eard; the main sewers run through the leading thoroughfares from one end o the other ; of their tributaries many have been already for some time in Active operation, and many others are yet in contemplation. Houses of almost every class may find a suitable locale. The Gentleman and the Artizan may each have his pleasant dwelling, and that without those drawbacks vhich in former times may have been our stigma. Our swamps and open litches have under your rule been gradually banished from our sight by an efficient system of drainage, and many of the low-classed properties have been wonderfully improved. Such advantages may yet be marred. The Building Act, though Forking much for good, is still defective in many main and essential pariculars. The restrictions upon building operations are not sufficient to revent the speculative builder from raising his block of houses in the fields vith neither road nor sewer for their accommodation, and these persons are tho first raise a cry against the Local Board on both these scores. The result is requently a fever-stricken family from defective sanitary conditions, and when once contagious maladies begin on fitting soil it sometimes proves a difficulty to check their spread. But even if monetary considerations alone guided us in this respect the aw relating to the irremovable poor, as at present in existence, makes it assential that we should diminish as far as possible the pauperizing influences within our District. I need not say how greatly sanitary defects contribute o the amount of sickness amongst the poor, and how greatly increased is he cost therefrom. The following statistics have been kindly furnished to me by Mr. Svvail, he Chairman of the Board of Guardians, from which it will be seen how seriously the charges from pauperism have increased among us during the ast 10 years in spite of all the great improvements which have been effected:— Relief of Irremovable Poor for the Year ending March 25th, 1856. £ s. d. Fulham . . 884 3 9 Hammersmith , 761 11 7 J House , . 527 15 9 £2,173 11 1£ Relief of Irremovable Poor for tho Year ending March 25th, 1856. £. s. d. Fulliam . 884 3 9 Hammersmith 761 11 7 1/4 House , 527 15 9 £2,173 11 10 For the Year ending March 25th, 1866 £. s. d. Fulham 1675 3 9¾ Hammersmith . 1302 10 7 House 934 9 11¾ £3912 4 4½ The energies of your Board must therefore still be actively directed to a further extension of the Sewerage and to .1 considerable extension of the Water Mains throughout your district, with an unscrupulous watchfulness over speculative building. The passing of an Amended Law relating to Public Health in 18GG must be regarded as of much importance. Considerably enlarged powers have been given to the Authorities, and though many deficiencies still exist yet many useful clauses have been introduced. The Act is divided into three parts with regard to England:—1. An Amendment of the Sewage Utilization Act 1865. 2. An Amendment of the Nuisance Removal Act; and 3, relates to miscellaneous proceedings. Part 1 is devoted principally to clauses affecting the application of the Sewage Utilization Act generally through the Country, shewing who are the Sewer Authorities for carrying out its provisions, and providing for the formrtion of Sewer Districts where none exist. It is impossible to overrate the importance of this Act to the Metropolis, if rivers arc still to form the chief souive of our Water Supply. The pollution by the Sewage of many considerable Towns of the water of the Thames, the Coltie, the Lea, and several other Metropolitan Rivers with their tributaries, has become a grave and serious drawback to a pure supply, and whilst London itself had spent its millions to accomplish the diversion of its filth the benefit appeared likely to be neutralized by the increasing communities above. Part 2 considerably enlarges the Powers conferred by the Nuisances Removal Act of 1855, and defines what is meant in future by the words "Nuisance," and "Nuisance Authority." Here power is also given to the Police under certain restrictions to execute the provisions of the Nuisances Removal Act in default of the proper Nuisance Authority. The like action is given to any ten inhabitants of a place under requisition for the purposes of the 27th section of the Nuisances Removal Act relating to noxious trades. Clause 19 is that which specially defines what is meant by a nuisance. In the subsequent sections of this part power is given to the Local Authorities for enforcing the cleansing of infected houses, for providing the means and apparatus for disinfection, for providing carriages for the conveyance of persons suffering from infectious diseases, and for the prevention of the use of Public Carriages for this purpose without due precaution. Power also is given in them to the Local Authorities to provide Hospital accommodation, and for the removal thereto of infected persons, and also for the provision of Public Mortuaries. The want of some public receptacle for the dead from infectious diseases has always been a crying want of the Fulham District The necessities of 11 Pulham Parish in this respect have I am happy to say with the sanction of Four Board been Bupplied, a public Mortuary having been erected in the Fulham Cemetery at a trifling cost during the late Cholera season. A similar Building or one of brick or corrugated iron should be provided for HammerSmith. The vacant portion of St. Paul's Churchyard would offer an approcriate spot. In Part 3 a power is given to the Secretary of State on application from the Nuisance Authority to make Regulations as to Lodging Houses, and for Registration of Houses let or occupied in Lodgings other than Common. Lodging Houses. Here a penalty also is imposed on persons suffering from infectious diseases exposing themselves in public places and Conveyances, Whilst provision is made for the disinfection of infected clothing, bedding, &c. Clause 53 provides for the periodical removal of manure from Stables, Mews, &c. Part 4 applies to Ireland only. Independently of the outbreak of Cholera there has been nothing injudiciously to characterize the past year as regards the Fuliiam District. The eneral health has been preserved, and Zymotic diseases have certainly not eon active. Small Pox, however, may probably be excepted, and sufficient lay be said about it to stigmatize the Vaccination Laws as miserably futile and powerless to check it. The paltry Fee paid for its performance to the public Vaccinator, and the prejudices of the people still give this disgusting hianlady an ascendancy which ought not to be. It has added 21 to our number if deaths in 18G6. The deaths from Measles have been 38; from Scarlatina 8; from Diphtheria 7 ; from Whooping Cough 27; from Fever of the nrious types 25 ; from Diarrhœa 65 ; and from Cholera 41. The sacrifice of Infant life has borne its usual lamentable proportions. This year has arried away 516 children before five summers had been numbered, and 301 tad not attained even one year of age. Ought this to be ? There is some onsolation in the fact that of the 1,149 deaths amongst us 6 had attained the ge of 90 and upwards; 45 died between 80 and 90; and 108 between 70 and 80 years of age. The Mortality of the Public Institutions and Lunatic Asylums has been is follows:—West Lm.-on Hospital 16 ; Union House 70; Almshouses 12; lonvn Ca.holic Institution.; 33 ; and Lunatic Asylums 13. Fifty-eight Ii quests have been recorded in the Registrars' Returns. Phthisis has cut off 119 persons. The number of Births regist ered in the District was 1845, shewing an increase of Births over Deaths of 696. F. om the foregoing it will be seen that 159 of the persons who have lied amongst us in 1866, had attained to more than 70 years of age. The following tabl •, which has been also furnished to me by Mr. Swail, .hows the natural longevity even amongst the poor of our district. Number and ages of the Poor receiving Out-door relief on 28th May, 1867.

The total quantity of rain collected 30.62 inches, which has fallen on 193 days. The rain-fall was 7.18 inches above the average of the last 11 years, and was only exceeded in one year—1860, when it was 31.41. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FREDK. J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. Hammersmith, July, 1867. board of works for the fulham district. The reports of the Medical Officer of Health, relating to the steps taken under the "Order in Council," dated 21st July, 1866, for preventing the spread of Cholera in this District, having been presented to the Board, and the Clerk, pursuant to instructions, having submitted a statement of expenses incurred therein,—it was resolved and ordered, that the reports and statements be printed and circulated. W. LOVELY, Clerk, Broadway House, 28th Nov. 1866. TO THE SANITARY COMMITTEE, BOARD OF WORKS, FULHAM DISTRICT. FULHAM PARISH, Gentlemen, It is with considerable satisfaction I present you the remainder of the accounts, under the head of Cholera Expenses. The total represents, it is true, a considerable sum, but it also represents an immunity from the more costly effects of the fatal scourge, which has for several months just past, devastated many parts of the Metropolitan District. With a population such as that under your control, with many influences at work likely to engender, or at any rate to tempt, the extension of an epidemic malady, with the intermingling of our people with infected districts, and with atmospheric conditions which would render it well nigh impossible to escape the general Choleraic influence, it is consolatory to know that Fulham has escaped a dire mortality,— has passed indeed through a troublous season, not only without excess of death rate, but actually with diminished consequences of ordinary autumnal sickness. That this immunity has resulted from the increased watchfulness and activity of the Sanitary department of the Board of Works, under your authority and sanction, few I think will doubt. The Medical Staff appointed by your direction, with the additional Inspectors of Nuisances, all acting under my constant supervision, have kept anxious watch over the poor localities, and whilst the former have placed under prompt and careful treatment all cases of premonitory diarrhoea, the latter have closely followed in their wake, attending to all conditions detrimental to the public health, and freely distributing disinfectants wherever necessity or precaution required. The stall of dispensing Chemists which have been engaged have also done good service in the cause, so that every possible facility has been offered to the needy portion of the inhabitants for procuring medical advice and medicines, and the number of persons who have availed themselves of these opportunities fully testify to their usefulness and desirability. The danger of drinking impure water has also met with that consideration at your hands which it deserved, and, with your sanction, I have ordered StandPosts to be erected, and kept at daily work for several weeks, in such localities, as in my judgment, I considered most necessary for the use of the poorer classes. By this means one considerable source of risk amongst them lius been 14 avoided, and the use of surface wells (at all times dangerous and objectionable' has as far as possible been limited, during Ihe Cholera season, to purposes only o a domestic character. These temporary arrangements have now been suspended, in the hope thai the necessity for their existence has passed away, but with such a subtle enemy as Cholera it is well to look ahead, and be prepared at any moment to re-establisl: them should it threaten a re-appeavance. The effects of early treatment, eves in ordinary Diarrhoea, have been most marked, for although a very large number of cases have been dealt with, the mortality of the parish from this cause has been almost nominal. To the Medical Visitors, Messrs. McLeod, Walls, and Barnes, I am much indebted, for their prompt and considerate co-operation, whilst I have largely availed myself of the services of my son, Dr. F. J. Burge, in carrying out my special duties. The kind and generous assistance of your Committee has also been of most material service to me in the execution of my responsible and onerous task, anil I can only hope that my own exertions to keep in check this formidable disease have been such as to ensure your cordial approval. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. Hammersmith, Nov. 5th, 1866. TO THE SANITARY COMMITTEE, BOARD OF WORKS, FULIIAM DISTRICT. 'HAMMERSMITH PARISH. Gentlemen, In compliance with your request, I beg to lay before you the various accounts, under the head of Cholera Expenses, incurred daring the late visitation of Cholera in this Parish; together with a report of the proceedings taken to check the progress of that disease, under the Resolutions of the Board of July 30th ult. I It will be within the remembrance of your Committee, that early in the month of July last, cases of a suspicious character arose in Hammersmith, followed by others of a more ominous description about the middle of the month. It was, however, on the 2nd of August that the disease appeared in an unmistakeable form, aud then I felt it my duty to take all the precautions and active proceedings which I was empowered to carry into effect by the above Resolutions, accordingly forthwith appointed Mr. Alderson (whose services I had required during the night) to the Medical charge of the Town District; and, subsequently Messrs. Barnes, Bannister, and Tenison were placed in Medical charge of other portions of the Parish. Dr. Bannister having shortly after resigned, Mr. Fennings was appointed in his stead. The various salaries apportioned to these gentlemen appear in the accounts before you. From these you will perceive that the Medical arrangements have been carried out with a strict regard to economy and efficiency. A staff of Dispensing Chemists were also appointed in the most convenient localities, whose accounts I also herewith present. Arrangements were also made for the speedy interment of the dead from Cholera, and the prompt destruction or disinfection of infected clothes and bedding. An ample supply of Disinfectants, (Carbolic Acid, and Condy's Fluid, &c. &c.',) have been provided, and the public sewers as well as private drains have been freely deodorised therewith. 15 For the guidance of the Medical Visitors, a code of regulations was drawn up —a copy of which I have already had the honour to lay before you; whilst handbills containing instructions to the public, precautionary against Cholera, as well as for the management of the sick and sick room in that disease, were printed ind freely circulated amongst the poor. To guard against the danger of the use of impure water from surface wells, Stand-Posts supplied by the AVater Companies have been eretfed in various poor localities, which have been much appreciated. The above forms a brief summary of the steps which I have felt it my duty to take for the prevention and check of this formidable disease; and although I have to report that various parts of the Parish have been attacked by the Choleraic poison, I am happy to state that the measures adopted in each have appeared successfully to mitigate its severity and check its spread. The Medical Visitors have severally supplied me with a Daily Return of the cases coming under their care, together with a Weekly Summary of the same. Under my instructions a record also has been kept, and duly made to me of the general treatment adopted by the Medical Visitors in the various cases coming under their care,—a feature which I hope to utilize for the public good at no distant period. These temporary arrangements have now been suspended, in the hope that the necessity for their existence has passed away, but, with sucl a subtle enemy as Cholera, it is well to look ahead, and be prepared at any moment to take action should it threaten a re-appearance. The good effects arising from the early treatment of premonitory Diarrhoea have been most marked,—for although a very large number of cases have been dealt with, the mortality of the Parish from this cause has been almost nominal. The expense incurred, though large, is inconsiderable compared with other Parishes similarly situated ; whilst it is to be hoped that the saving of human life, and the preservation of the general sanitary condition of the Parish, may be considered worth the sacrifice alike of labour and of money. The total mortality from Cholera has been 31,—of which 4 occurred in Queen Street, 4 in Paradise How, 1 in Trafalgar Street, 1 in Hope Place, 2 in the Creek, 1 in Brook Green Lane, 3 in A harf Road, Latymer Road; 4 in Lavinia Terrace, Starch Green; 4 in George Yard, Broadway; 3 in the Lower Mall; 1 in Banner's Yard ; 1 in Heath's Place, Uxbridge Road; 1 in Bridge Street; and 1 in Plantation Place, Starch Green. To the Medical Visitors, Messrs. Aldersox, Barnes, Fennxsgs, and Tenison, I feel deeply indebted for their prompt and considerate co-operation, whilst I have been compelled largely to avail myself of the service of my son, Dr. F. J. Burrge, in accordance with the power vested in me by the Board. I feel bound also to bear my testimony to the willing aid afforded me by Messrs. Slater and Hubbard, the Inspectors of Nuisances, on several occasions fraught with much personal danger of infection. In the execution of the onerous and responsible duties which have devolved - upon me, duties which for many weeks have well nigh occupied the greater portion of my time, I have conscientiously endeavoured to guard the general interests of the District, and to carry out the wishes of the Board in accordance with the necessities of the moment, honestly and sincerely. I append a Cholera Map hereto, showing the localities which have been affected by the disease, with the number of deaths which have occurred in each, i and the sequence in which the disease appeared. Without endorsing the view ' that drinking impure water ia the main vehicle for the dissemination of the Cholera poison, I feel sufficient has been said and proved that it is at any rate a very c frequent, and a very mischievous means of propagating the disease. Whether i from well or river, to which the special poison of the disease has gained access, the 16 effects are equally pernicious, but facts go also far to prove that drinking impure water under any and every condition does impart an unmistakeable susceptibility to its action, and that where this hygienic safeguard is neglected, there Cholera, when epidemic, reigns destructively and surely. It is a curious and noteworthy coincidence in connection with this outbreak ol Cholera amongst us, that it has attacked those places which are almost without exception supplied with water from surface wells. Here timely aid has been given in this respect, and this, with other preventive measures, have answered our purpose well. The seeds of the contagion have been scorched, as it were, in the bud, ere they had time tc germinate. The relief afforded in the prompt interment of the dead has been gratefully received, and many an honest parent or child relieved of a pressing weight on their present and future energies. Bed-clothes and Bedding, and even Clothing, saturated with Choleraic poison, have been destroyed, and replaced at the public cost, of insignificant amount compared with the wide spread poisoned influence which, under less active regime, mi^ht have reigned triumphant. 'Tis not within the scope of human power to rule the tide of epidemic influences, or regulate those atmospheric or climacteric conditions which carry with them increased susceptibility to contagious or epidemic maladies, but it is within our reach to see that all those conditions, which experience has proved to be damaging to our existence, be removed as quickly and efficiently as circumstances admit of. A Choleraic Atmosphere has ruled through many weeks of the Autumn of this year. The " Blue Mist " of Glaisher has indeed prevailed in Eastern London, and dire have been its consequences. It has assumed a brownish hue, in which the Western suburbs have for weeks together been enveloped, as it were, with a cloak. The absence of Solar influence has been remarkable, and its consequences have not been limited to animal life. The Vegetable Kingdom has alike suffered in proportion. The oidium of the Grape, and the Potato blight, have had full play ; our cereals, too, have not escaped. That atmospheric influences have been at work, independently of local conditions in Hammersmith during the late Cholera season, is certain, from the peculiar manner in which cases of that disease have been dotted about the Parish. Neither fixity of habitat, nor conditions of special type, have marked its course or character. It has found a victim in the north, then south, or east, or west, without apparent cause ; here one, there two, anon three lives have fallen ; but wheresoever it appeared, there energetic hygienic efforts were brought to bear, and with what good results the sequels proved. Gentlemen,—the Resolutions of your Board of the 30th of July necessarily cast upon me a most grave and serious responsibility. As your Officer of Health it was my duty to accept it. Of the propriety of the orders conveyed therein no one can doubt. The zeal with which you met the demands of the Government have, I trust, found a ready response with me ; and I can only hope that as my desiro has been, so may I have succeeded in carrying my instructions into effect in such a manner as to have ensured the good results you may have anticipated, aa well as your general approval. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Healths Hammersmith, Nov. 8th, 1866. CHOLERA EXPENSES. FULHAM. HAMMERSMITH. £ 8. d. £ s. d.
