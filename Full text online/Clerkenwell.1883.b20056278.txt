TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT of THE VESTRY of the parish of ST, JAMES AND ST. JOHN, CLERKENWELL. FOR THE YEAR 1883-4. Presented pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18th and 19th Vict., cap. 120. london: w. j. goode, printer, 23, st. johns lane, clerkenwell. 1884. REPORT OF THE VESTRY For the Year ended 25 th March, 1884. Pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, beg to present the following Report of their proceedings under the above Act, and the other Acts which are administered by them, during the year ended on the 25th March, 1884. Rates,— During the year the Kates made by the Vestry were as follows: — For the half-year to Michaelmas, 1883. A Poor Rate of 1s. 9d. in the £, estimated to realize £27,300 A Sewer ,, 3d. ,, „ ,, 3,900 A Lighting „ 1d. „ „ ,, 1,300 A General ,, 10d. ,, „ ,, 13,000 2s. 11d. £45,500 For the half-year to Lady-day, 1884. A Poor Rate of 1s. 3d. in the £, estimated to realize £22,100 A Main Drainage ,, 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,300 A Lighting ,, 2d. ,, ,, „ 2,600 A General „ 1s. 0d. „ ,, ,, 15,600 2s. 8d. £41,600 4 The rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £334,849, and those for the half-year to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £335,610. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £27,874 in the first, and £23,947 in the second half-year, towards which the Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £3,933 0s. 10d. and £6,141 7s. 6d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the year was for the sum of £8,663 9s. 2d. and that of the School Board of £9,397 16s. 2d. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,002 19s. 10d. It will thus be seen that of the £87,100 raised during the year, the sum of £66,809 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry. Valuation Lists.—A Supplemental, and two Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out and deposited during the year, affecting some 110 assessments, and producing a net increase in the rateable value of about £3,469. Gates and Bars across thoroughfares.—This matter was again brought under the notice of the Vestry by the Vestry of St. Pancras, (in which Parish there is a very large number of streets obstructed by gates and bars,) who passed a resolution calling the attention of the Home Secretary to the matter, and requesting him to insert, in any Bill he may introduce relating to the government of the Metropolis, a clause for the abolition of such gates and bars, or to deal with the matter in any other way he may deem fit. This Vestry adopted the same course, and later on, on the 20th March, appointed three delegates to a Conference at the St. Pancras Vestry Hall to consider the matter. 5 Bakehouses.—The Factories and Workshops Bill, 1883, alluded to in the last Report, having passed into law, was duly considered by the Sanitary Committee. By Clause 17 the enforcement of Sections 3, 33, 34 and 35 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and other sanitary conditions, was re-transferrod from the Factory Inspectors to the Local Authorities, and all the powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings, &c., conferred upon the Factory Inspectors by the Act of 1878, were transferred to the Medical Officers of Health of the Local Authorities. With regard to bakehouses used for the first time as such after the 1st June last, the Act provides that— (i) No water closet, earth closet, privy, or ash pit shall be within or communicate directly with the bakehouse. (ii) Any cistern for supplying water to the house, shall be separate and distinct from any cistern for supplying water to a water closet. (iii) No drain or pipe for carrying off foecal or sewage matter shall have an opening within the bakehouse. Having considered the subject, the Vestry, upon the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, were of opinion that some regulations of the nature of the above may properly be applied to all bakehouses, and they therefore resolved:— That in cases where the same cistern supplies water to the W.C. and for baking purposes, waste preventers or otherwise, be required to be provided to secure a separate supply. That water closets directly communicating with bakehouses or flour stores be done away with. 6 That all underground cisterns used for baking purposes be abolished. Accordingly notices were served to abolish all such, and some were done away with. But in the case of an underground cistern at a bakehouse at 44, Penton Street, the proprietor, Mr. Lawrie, not having complied with the notice served, the solicitors to the Vestry were consulted, and advised that the law did not require such abolition unless the existence of the cistern constituted a nuisance. Nevertheless, on the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, the case was carried into the police-court, and was dismissed with costs, there being no evidence that the cistern was foul or the water impure. Artizans' Dwellings Acts.—In July last, the Vestry received a letter from the Home Secretary, calling attention to the desirability of the Medical Officer of Health being instructed to make an Official Representation to the Metropolitan Board of Works under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875-1882 (Cross's Acts). In the same month also, the Local Government Board, having regard to the possible visitation of cholera, called attention to the desirability of the Medical Officer being instructed to make a return of any places in the Parish which he might consider should be deals with under the Artizans' Dwellings Acts, 1868-1882 (Torrens' Acts). The Sanitary Committee, with the Medical Officer, visited the various courts in the Parish, the result of which was that the Medical Officer submitted an Official Representation to the Metropolitan Board of Works (under Cross's Acts), with respect to Smith's Place, Slades Place, and Bishop's Court, and to the Vestry under Torrens' Acts as to— Fox Terrace Bolton Court Union Place Margaret Court John's Place 13, 14, 15, Eagle Court Exmouth Place Rhodes Buildings. 7 The Metropolitan Board, however, declined to take any action with regard to the areas referred to them, being of opinion that they were rather within the scope of Torrens' Acts than of Cross's; and the Medical Officer consequently, on the 10th January, 1884, submitted an Official Representation to the Vestry under Torrens' Acts with regard to these areas. These Representations were then referred to the Surveyor, in accordance with the Act, whose reports on the matter were received on the 10th March, and referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report. The subject was at this stage at the close of the parochial year with which this Report deals. Electric Lighting.—It will be remembered that in the last Annual Report it was stated that the Vestry were prepared to give their assent to the application of the Metropolitan Brush Electric Lighting Co. for a Provisional Order upon certain amendments being accepted by the Company and the Board of Trade; the Board of Trade however, in April, 1883 prepared a model Provisional Order, to the general principles and form of which they stated they should adhere, leaving it to the Promoters and the local authorities to settle between them the special local particulars, such as those relating to area and the deposit of capital. This Provisional Order was found to meet the majority of the objections of the Vestry to that of the Promoters, and they therefore accepted same. The representatives of the Company then had an interview with the Committee of Works, when it was agreed that the area of the Parish to be included in Schedule A should be that comprised within Exmouth Street and Myddelton Street on the north, St. John Street Road on the east, Corporation Row and Bowling Green Lane on the south, and Farringdon Road on the west, and that of the capital which it was proposed to appropriate for the work (£15,000) ten per cent. should be deposited or secured, 8 under Clause 8 of the Provisional Order, for the purpose of the repair of the roads and footways disturbed for the works, and upon this basis the Provisional Order became an Act of Parliament. No steps were taken, however, by the Company towards carrying out the Order, but in January, 1884 they made an application to the Board of Trade for an extension of the time prescribed by the Order for the appropriation and deposit of capital, and to this the Vestry assented. With regard to the lighting of Pentonville Road by the Maxim Weston Electric Co. with incandescent lights which was in progress at the date of the report, the Vestry have to express their regret that a more favourable termination of their experiment was not arrived at. In consequence of the gradually decreasing power of the incandescent lights, owing probably to faulty laying of the cables, the Company replaced the incandescent lights by arcs, but these in their turn were defective, and finally ceased running about a fortnight before the expiration of the contract. The Vestry, however, are alive to the desirability of an improved lighting of this and other main thoroughfares, and have referred the matter to the Lighting Commitee to consider the question of placing larger gas burners in the lamps. Water Companies' Charges.—Among the legal decisions of the year the Judgment of the House of Lords in the case Dobbs v. The Grand Junction Waterworks Company, has perhaps excited the most interest. Though a matter over which the Vestries and District Boards have no control, it may be found convenient to give a short resume of the facts of the case here :— 9 Mr. Dobbs, as the owner of the house in which he resides, originally appealed to Mr. Cooke, the Marylebone Police Magistrate, against the claim of the Company to rate him for water rate upon the gross annual value of the house, contending that by their Act 7th Geo. IV., Cap. 140, Sec. 27, when the rent cannot be ascertained, the water rate should be charged upon the annual value upon which the Assessment to the Poor rate is computed. By the Act 15 and 16 Vict., Cap. 152, Sec. 46, it was provided that the Company should be entitled to levy a rate upon the "annual value" of the houses they supplied. Mr. Cooke dismissed the summons, but granted a special case for the opinion of the Queen's Bench Division upon the question of law as to whether he was right in deciding that Sect. 46 of 15 and 16 Viet., Cap. 157 was applicable, and that the gross value, as interpreted by the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, was the proper basis of assessment, or whether he should have decided that such basis should be the rateable value of the premises. The special case came on for argument in the Queen's Bench Division in March 1882. when the Court reversed the decision of the Magistrate, holding that the 27th Sect. of 7 Geo. IV., Cap 140, was not repealed, and that the rent of the premises could not be ascertained, and that upon the proper construction of the section in question the rate should be based upon the rateable value of the premises. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division, holding that the 27th Sect. of the 7th Geo. IV. Cap. 140, was not repealed, but that upon the proper construction of such section, the rate should be based upon the gross value. Mr. Dobbs then appealed to the House of Lords, and at this stage he requested contributions from the various local authorities of the metropolis, seeing that should the decision of the House of Lords be in his favor it would practically have the effect of lowering the charges for water to the large majority of the ratepayers of the metropolis. This Vestry felt the force of Mr. Dobb 10 appeal, and contributed twenty guineas towards his costs. The case was argued on the 3rd August, and judgment given on the 30th November, that the words "annual value" in the Company's Acts mean the net (and not the gross) value. The Corporation of London then introduced a Bill into Parliament dealing with the London Water Supply, making it optional on the part of the consumers to receive water by meter, defining the annual value as the rateable value upon which the Poor rate is made; compelling the adoption of a sliding scale for the dividends; and making regulations with respect to the capital of the companies. This Vestry, however, though recognising the desirability and necessity of the whole question being comprehensively dealt with, did not see their way to supporting the Bill, as it appeared to them that the effect of the provision as to an optional meter supply would be to benefit the ratepayers of the City itself, by a large decrease in the water rentals, and probably to provoke the Companies to make reprisals in the poor parishes outside the City to recoup them for their loss of revenue. The Legislature appears to have taken the same view, for the Bill was thrown out on the second reading on the 11th March, 1884. Proposed Board School, Green Terrace.—At the end of November it was found, that the London School Board had scheduled ten houses in Green Terrace (Nos. 1 to 10), and a Lecture Hall and three houses in Upper Gloucester Street as a site for a Board School. These premises being houses of a superior class, with workshops attached, and the occupants persons with businesses which would suffer by removal, the Vestry were of opinion that the action of the School Board would tend to the deterioration of the Parish, and in this view they were supported by the inhabitants of the scheduled houses, and their neighbours generally, including the New River Company, who presented a Petition to the Vestry protestiug against the action of the 11 School Board, and asking the Vestry to take such steps as they might be able to do to induce the School Board to reconsider their decision. The Vestry thereupon wrote the School Board, suggesting Lloyd's Row and Thomas Street, opposite Green Terrace, as equally eligible and less expensive, and appointed a deputation, who waited upon a Committee of the School Board, and urged the objections to the Green Terrace site, but on the 18th March a letter was received from the Works Committee of the Board, stating that they could not see their way to recommend the Board to abandon the site. Upon the receipt of this letter the Vestry expressed their regret at the decision of the Board, and directed the Clerk to point out several other sites in the immediate neighbourhood more suitable than Green Terrace. Accordingly, on the 21st March a letter was written suggesting Hardwick Street, a piece of vacant land in Rawstorne Street, Taylor's Row, Fletcher's Row, Northampton Row, and vacant land in Farringdon Road (site of the Clerkenwell Workhouse). To this, however, the Board replied that they were not prepared to abandon the site in Green Terrace. The Vestry, however, not being satisfied with that decision, hope that further steps may yet be taken to preserve Green Terrace. Goswell Road.—The paving and irregular cleansing of the lower portion of Goswell Road being the subject of some complaint, owing to the lapse of an agreement for 21 years made in 1857, between this Vestry and the Vestry of St. Luke's, by which the latter Vestry undertook the repair of the southern portion, while Clerkenwell had the control of the northern, the Vestry have entered into negociations with St. Luke's with the view of again dividing the road latitudinally between the two Parishes, and have come to an arrangement to divide the road opposite Seward 12 Street, St. Luke's taking charge of the southern, and Clerkenwell of the northern portion as before, but which arrangement had not been carried into effect at the close of the year to which this report relates. Tramways.—The Tramway Schemes introduced into Parliament in the Session 1884, affecting the Parish, were the proposal of the London Street Tramways Company, to lay tram lines along King's Cross Road and Farringdon Road, and that of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company to construct a passing place in Goswell Road, opposite Compton Street. To both the Schemes the Vestry gave its assent; to the former upon the Company agreeing to pay for the paving taken by them in King's Cross Road at 8s. per yard, and in Farringdon Road at 10s. per yard. The Vestry appreciating the want of a vehicular service for the large populations which are collecting in the blocks of model dwellings, &c., in the neighbourhood of Farringdon Road, petitioned the Metropolitan Board of Works and both Houses of Parliament in favour of the Scheme; but without avail, the Bill being ultimately thrown out. The Bill of the North Metropolitan Tramway Co. (chiefly affecting other Parishes) was also lost, the Goswell Road improvement being sacrificed with the remainder of the Bill. New Street from Gray's Inn Road to the Angel.— Notwithstanding the non-success of the Scheme introduced last year by the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Vestry with the Islington Vestry and the Holborn District Board of Works, have again Memorialised that Board to re-introduce the Scheme in their next Streets Improvement Bill, and the Board has decided to do so. Widening of St. John Street.—On the 6th March a Memorial was presented to the Vestry, signed by 413 inhabitants of St. John Street and the neighbourhood, urging 13 upon the Vestry the desirability of widening the narrow portion of Saint John Street between Aylesbury Street and Albemarle Street. The Vestry referred the matter to a Committee for consideration, who directed the Surveyor to prepare a ground plan of the property which would be required to be taken and to report upon the matter ; and the question was at this stage at Lady-day, 1884. Colney Hatch Lane.—The Vestry regret that no solution of the difficulties connected with the drainage of the houses on the Clerkenwell side of this lane has yet been found. It will be remembered that in the last Report, it was stated that the Vestry had called upon the Metropolitan Board of Works to provide a system of sewerage for the locality, but that no reply had then been received from them. The question is apparently still in the same stage, no reply having yet been received. It is understood that, owing to the configuration of the ground, a junction with the Metropolitan system could only be accomplished at an enormous outlay, and as the houses to be drained are very few, it is hoped that some arrangements may be come to with one of the Local Boards of the adjacent districts, but at present this desirable consummation is not reached, and complaints continue to be made of nuisances for the want of proper means of drainage. Cholera.*—The action taken by the Vestry in anticipation of an epidemic of Cholera in the summer and autumn of 1883, will be found fully set forth in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, at page 59. Sanitary condition of Clerkenwell.—On the 25th January a Deputation from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor had an interview with Sir Charles Dilke, President of the Local Government Board, and Sir * A very interesting Table, issued by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, showing the relative prevalence of Cholera in the various districts in the Metropolis during the visitations in 1832-3, 1849, 1854, and 1866, will be found as Appendix (No. 2), at pages 98 & 99, and will have special interest for Clerken- well at the present time. 14 William Harcourt, Home Secretary, at the Local Government Board, on the question of the improvement of the Dwellings of the Poor, urging an amendment of the law so as to enable the local authorities to more efficiently provide house accommodation for the Poor, and in the course of his reply to the Deputation, Sir Charles Dilke said:—"Taking London as a whole, that [the declining condition of the town] is probably not the case, because in my recent visits to various parts of London I have compared the present state of things with the case of Mr. George Godwin, when he wrote 'London Shadows' in 1854, and there has generally been an improvement since that time. But in the central portion of the town, in the districts of Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, Holborn, and Bermondsey, the contrary is the case, and the state of things is now probably worse than it has ever been before." To this the Medical Officer replied as follows :— To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I noticed in the issue of the Times for January 20th the report of a speech made by Sir Charles Dilke, in which the Parish of Clerkenwell is denounced us one of the retrograde Metropolitan Parishes. I beg to remark that if this statement is intended to apply to the sanitary condition of the Parish it is not founded upon fact. In 1878 I reported that the mortality was lower than it had ever been since the establishment of the Vestry. In subsequent years it fell still lower, and I have now to report that the mortality of the past year has been again less than in any previous year, amounting to only 18 per 1000, and this notwithstanding an increase of population; while the mortality of all London is 21, that of the North district 19, the West district 19, the South 20, the Central 23, and the East districts 25. At the same time, it must be recollected that for some years past many of the well-to-do residents of the Parish have been gradually leaving their houses, which become occupied by a poorer class of people, many of the houses being formerly held by one family, being now let to several. When these poorer people, especially the labourers, enter a house, at once begins a course of dirt and destruction. The locks and handles of doors become toys for the children, and are soon demolished. The drain traps are soid at the bone and bottle shops 15 those left are never kept on; the closets are stopped up and the pans are broken. The chimneys are never swept, so that the rooms become blackened and disfigured. The paper is torn off the walls; the floors and passages are never washed, and there are no mats, so that the whole place becomes a mass of dirt and destruction. The water-butt lids and the dust-bin lids are used for firewood; the ball-cocks are broken off, so that there is great water waste, which floods the yards and washes away the cement from the paving. The very hand-rails of the staircase are broken away, and even the walls are picked with nails, or something of the kind, so as to leave large holes. The windows are constantly broken and stopped up with brown paper; in fact, there exists in every parish a juvenile windowbreaking club, the members of which demolish every pane of glass they can, especially iu empty houses. As the better houses are becoming filled with these families, the prospect is truly not favourable; moreover, in Clerkenwell, a population of ice sellers and French organ grinders is gradually creeping in from Holborn, whose habits are filthy and unsanitary in the extreme. New regulations are being framed by the Vestry to remedy these evils ; but I fear they will be nugatory in effect. These disorderly people and their children require proper training, whick I hoped years ago would have been acquired through the School Board, but it has not occurred; in fact, many women, who, when younger, have been in service, and have kept an eight-roomed house in perfect order under a mistress, when living in only one or two rooms of their own, allow them to become a mass of dirt. Let us hope, however, that a better state of things may come; but it is evident that many of the newly proposed improvements refer rather to a condition of ornamental repair of the dwellings than to requirements of health. In fact, after daily inspection of the dwellings of the poor for more than 40 years, and hearing the remarks made upon them, I cannot help thinking that those who legislate in the matter should be landlords for a time at least, to enable them to become acquainted with the relation of repairs to reckless damage. At all events, it is evident that the condition of the Parish, described as " worse than it has ever been before," does not relate to its sanitary condition, which, through the incessant labours of the Vestry, has continued to improve, in spite of the increase of an unsanitary population. And when it is recollected that our worst courts—the terrible Turnmill Street Courts (specially mentioned by Mr. Godwin), Sedbury Place, Wood's Place, Suffolk Court, and Caroline Court—have been demolished, and replaced by the fine model buildings—Corporation Buildings, Farringdon Buildings, Compton Buildings, and Peabody 16 Buildings, and that several hundreds of underground kitchens have been emptied, not to mention the numberless drainage and other defects which have been remedied, to way that the condition of the Parish is not improving is monstrous,— it is not true. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D. February 4th, 1884. And this letter was duly sent to the daily press. Sir Charles Dilke, however, appeared determined to prepare a way for the London Government Hill, which was to be introduced by the Government, by attacking the existing bodies and this Vestry in particular, and not only the Vestry as a body, but its individual members, for in a speech in the House of Commons on the 4th March, on the question of the Dwellings of the Poor, he said: "He was sorry to say, that in Clerkenwell, the two joint dictators of the Parish, who had control of the Vestry and its leading Committee, one of them being Chairman of the principal Committee, were the largest owners in the whole district of Clerkenwell of bad or doubtful property. The Royal Commission would have, perhaps, to go beyond the useful labour of the Committee of 1880, and make an inquiry into the question from this point of view, whether, in fact, it was not the case that many trading members of local authorities were large owners of property of this description. In Clerkenwell, there were 14 house farmers on the Vestry, and 12 publicans, who seemed to work very much with them, and that state of things had undoubtedly led to insufficient care being taken by the Vestry for the condition of that Parish." And on the 6th March the matter was brought before the Vestry, who directed the Clerk to send to Sir Charles Dilke a general statement and all information upon the present sanitary condition of Clerkenwell, compared with that of some years ago, and the Clerk therefore wrote the following letter :— 17 Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 58, Rosoman Street, E.C., March 20th, 1884. DWELLINGS IN CROWDED DISTRICTS. Sir, At the last meeting of this Vestry attention was called to the speech made by you in the House of Commons on the 4th instant, of which the report in the Times of the 5th instant is as follows:—" He was sorry to say in Clerkenwell the two joint dictators of the Parish, who had control of the Vestry and its leading Committees, one of them being Chairman of the principal Committee, were the largest owners in the whole district of Clerkenwell of bad or doubtful property. The Royal Commission would have, perhaps, to go beyond the useful labours of the Committee of 1880, and make an inquiry into the question from this point of view; whether, in fact, it was not the case that many leading members of local authorities were large owners of property of this description. In Clerkenwell, there were 14 house-farmers on the Vestry, and 12 publicans who seemed to work very much with them, and that state of things had undoubtedly led to insufficient care being taken by the Vestry for the condition of that Parish." It was thought that these observations reflected upon the Vestry as the local authority, and characterised Clerkenwell as a retrograde Parish, or, at least, one which made no progress in a sanitary point of view, in consequence of the composition of its representative body. I was, therefore, directed to send you a general statement and information upon the present sanitary condition of Clerkenwell, as compared with that of some years ago. I have the honour, accordingly, to annex some extracts from reports of our Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Griffith), made from time to time, which, it is hoped, will show that Clerkenwell, so far from being a non-progressive and one of the worst Parishes in the metropolis, is one of the best, if not the best in the metropolis in a sanitary point of view. I also annex a print of a special report of the Medical Officer of Health, dated 4th ult., as showing the difficulties which owners of houses let out in tenements, or occupied by more than one family, experience in regard to the premises being kept in proper order. The following is a copy of a return made to the Metropolitan Board some time ago of works carried out by the Vestry since its formation in 1856 to 25th of March, 1881:—Total length of new sewers constructed from 1st of January, 1856, to 25th of March, 1881, 1 mile, 1,736 yards; total cost of same, £3,122 14s. 7d.; total cost of other sanitary works executed by the Vestry, £24,691 17s.; total superficial 18 area of paving laid down from 1st of January, 1856, to 25th of March, 1881, 198,368 square yards; total cost of same, £74,437 10s. 4d.; total cost of any other street improvement executed by the Vestry, £45,984 18s. 3d.; number of additional street lamps put up from 1st of January, 1856, to 25th of March, 1881, 55; present mileage of the streets and roads under the jurisdiction of the Vestry, 19¾- miles. It will thus be seen that nearly £28,000 has been expended in sanitary works alone. The Vestry has established a Coroner's Court, and a mortuary (probably the best in London), at a cost of nearly £3,000, to which great numbers of bodies are removed annually from the dwellings of the poor, and the Vestry believe that, though imperfections may still exist, the Parish will very favourably compare with the metropolis generally as to its sanitary condition, and that the Vestry, whose labours have been incessant in this direction, do not merit any discouragement in their work. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, EGBERT PAGET. Vestry Clerk. To the Kight Hon. Sir Charles W. Dilke, Bart, M.P. P.S.-—I herewith enclose for your information print of "Return of works, and sanitary and other improvements, carried out by the Vestry during the 14½ years from the 1st January, 1856, to Lady-day, 1870, with costs &c.," which sets forth the sanitary work done by the Vestry more fully than can be described in a letter. I regret I have not a copy of the Annual Report of the Vestry for the year 1866-7 to forward to you, as that would probably show still more prominently the anxious activity of the Vestry in dealing with the unsanitary localities of the Parish. [enclosure.] Extracts from Special Report of Medical Officer of Health on Sanitary Condition of Parish, in 1872, made pursuant to reference. * * * * "Hence the mortality of the last two years has been below the average (1,563); that for 1870 by 90 deaths, that for 1871 by 146 deaths. Reducing the mortality to per thousand, the deaths 10 years ago (in 1862) amounted to 23 per thousand, in 1870 to 22 per thousand, and in 1871 to 21 per thousand. Hence the mortality of the last two years has been below the average, and below that of any of the last ten years. But this is only comparing the mortality of Clerkenwell at one period or term with that of the same parish at another period or term. 19 "On comparing this mortality with that of the whole metropolis, the numbers amounted per thousand in the metropolis, in 1862, to 23; in 1870, to 24 (1871 not yet published); so that not only has the mortality of Clerkenwell for the last two years been below the average belonging to the parish, and below that of any of the last ten years, but also below that of the metropolis generally. "The table'* I published in my report to the Vestry for 1863, also has interest in regard to this point. In it I showed that, out of the 35 metropolitan districts or parishes, Clerkenwell was tho twelfth in regard to its mortality. " Honce the resolution of the Vestry referred to does not appear to be founded on facts. " It should be remembered also that the police authorities have powers where the Vestry fails in duty, also that the Privy Council have the same independent power. But although tho police have often given information of important nuisances, which has always been at once acted upon by the Vestry, neither the police nor the Privy Council have ever found it necessary to exercise their independent power in Clerkenwell. "These are the most important points to which I should beg to direct the attention of the Vestry. But when the mortality per 1,000 is about 22 or 23, it is very difficult to reduce it without educating and improving the social and sanitary habits of the people." Extract from Medical Officer's Annual Report, 1881-2. " The mortality of the year 1881 has thus been below the average; and, in fact, below that of any year since the formation of the Vestry." " And the so recently taken census assures us that this does not arise from a diminution of population, which was found to have decidedly increased." Extract from Special Report.—Letter of February 4 th, 1884. " I notice in the issue of the Times for January 26th the report of a speech made by Sir Charles Dilke, in which the Parish of Clerkenwell is denounced as one of the retrograde Metropolitan Parishes. I beg to remark that if this statement is intended to apply to the sanitary condition of the Parish, it is not founded upon fact. In 1878, I reported that the mortality was lower than it had been since the establishment of the Vestry. In subsequent years it fell still lower; and I have now to report that the mortality of the past year has been again less than in any previous year, amounting to only 18 per 1,000, and this notwithstanding an increase of population, while the mortality of all London is 21, that of the north district 19, the west district 19, the south 20, the central 23, and the east district 23." * As this Table showing the then sanitary status of the several Parishes or Districts in the Metropolis, has special interest at the pretent time, it will be found reprinted as an Appendix (No. 3), at the end of the Report, page 110. r. p., V. c. 20 "At all events, it is evident that the condition of the Parish, described as 'worse than it has ever been before,' does not relate to its sanitary condition, which, through the incessant labours of the Vestry, has continued to improve in spite of the increase of an unsanitary population." To which Sir Charles Dilke replied as follows :— Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes, 8, Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, 24th March, 1884. Sir. The Royal Commission have had before them evidence as regards Clerkenwell from two of the clergymen of the parish, from Lord William Compton, from Mr. Boodle, and from four School Board visitors. They are to have before them to-morrow, two members of the Vestry, including the chairman of tho Sanitary Committee. It is not open to me to state the effect of the Clerkenwell evidence. It is my individual opinion, as expressed by me in the House of Commons, that the parish is deteriorating. Having visited the whole of the 32 districts of the metropolis, 1 consider, I am sorry to say, that tho evils to which I pointed are greater in Clerkenwell than in any of the others. It is, undoubtedly, true that the parish is a healthy one. I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, CHARLES W. DILKE. The matter was at this stage at Lady-day. Regulations under Sanitary Act, 1866.—At the end of the year 1883, a communication was received from the Local Government Board, that they had put in force Section 35 of the Sanitary Act, 1866 and Section 47 of the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874, the effect being that the Vestry is empowered to make regulations, subject to the confirmation of the Local Government Hoard, with respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, with respect to the following matters:— 1. For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. 21 2. For the registration of houses thus let or occupied. 3. For the inspection of such houses, and the keeping the same in a cleanly and wholesome state. 4. For enforcing therein the provision of privy- accommodation and other appliances and means of cleanliness in proportion to the number of lodgings and occupiers, and the cleansing and ventilation of the common passages and staircases. 5. For the cleansing and lime whiting at stated times of such premises. By the Act of 1874, the regulations may extend to ventilation of rooms, paving and drainage of premises, the separation of the sexes, and to notices to be given, and precautions to be taken in case of any dangerously infectious or contagious disease. The Board at the same time submitted a draft set of Regulations for the information and guidance of the Vestry. These Regulations were under the consideration of the Vestry at the close of the parochial year with which this Report deals. Public Health (Dairies, &c.) Bill.—Towards the close of the Session of 1883, this Bill was introduced into the House of Lords by the Lord President of the Privy Council. It proposed to transfer powers now exercised by the Privy Council and County Magistrates, &c., under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, to the Local Government Board and to the Sanitary Authorities in all parts of the kingdom, the Metropolis only excepted, where the Metropolitan Board of Works would continue to be the Local Authority. 22 The Vestry were, however, of opinion that the Vestries and District Boards, being the Sanitary Authorities, should be made also the Local Authorities in the Metropolis, and that for the sake of uniformity, the framing of Regulation should continue to be vested in the Metropolitan Board of Works, and a communication was addressed to the Lord President of the Council to this effect. Other Vestries and Boards took the same course, but the Bill was not proceeded with. Of the chief Bills introduced into the present Session of Parliament affecting the Vestry, the following is a brief summary: — Companies Acts Consolidation Bill.—By Clause 215 of this Bill, it was proposed to make salaries and wages only preferential claims in the case of Companies being wound up. It will be remembered that a clause was introduced into the Bankruptcy Bill of last year in the same form, but that upon the representation of Local Authorities of the country, parochial rates and taxes were included among the preferential debts. The Vestry, therefore, considered it desirable to apply the same provisions to Companies as to individuals, and they therefore presented a Petition to the House of Commons, praying for an extension of the Clause in the manner suggested, and asked the Borough and County Members to support same; but the Bill did not reach a second reading. Free Libraries Bill.—This Bill proposed, inter alia, to give Vestries and District Boards the power of adopting the Free Libraries Acts, and the Vestry therefore approved the Bill, and presented a Petition to Parliament in support thereof. 23 Dwelling Houses Inspection Bill.—This Bill proposed that Local Authorities should appoint Sanitary Inspectors, which appointments must receive the sanction and confirmation of the Local Government Board, to inspect all new buildings preparatory to their being occupied, and making it unlawful for any buildings to be occupied or used without the certificate of the Sanitary Inspector of his satisfaction therewith being first given; and also provided that the Sanitary Inspector shall once in every year make an inspection of the sanitary fittings, drains, &c., of all buildings existing in their districts. It appearing by the wording of Clause 3, that the Metropolis would not be embraced within the provisions of the Act, the Clerk was directed to write to the promoters of the Bill, asking if it is their intention to include the Metropolis within its provisions. This was done, and an affirmative reply was received, but no further action was taken by the Vestry, as no progress was made with the Bill. Metropolitan Board of Works (Fire Brigade Expenses) Bill.—This Bill proposed to alter the method of raising the Fire Brigade Expenses Bate (at present a half-penny in the £ on the gross value of the property assessed for the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, and contributions by the Insurance Companies at the rate of £35 for each million pounds of the gross amounts insured by such Companies), and to substitute in lieu thereof a provision that of the sum necessary for the purposes of the Fire Brigade, one-fourth shall be contributed by the Insurance Companies, and the remaining three-fourths by the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Yestry while recognising the necessity of increased means to give due efficiency and extension to the Fire Brigade, were of opinion that it is desirable that the Metropolitan Board should give some general estimate of the amount and extent of their requirements for the pro- 24 loot ion of lifa and property in the Metropolis, and the Board were communicated with accordingly; but they replied that they were not in a position to go into the general estimate of the amount and extent of its requirements for the purpose of making the requisite extension of the Fire Brigade. The Vestry then adopted the view expressed by the Vestry of St. Mary-le-Strand, that instead of an unlimited power of rating, the present limit of a halfpenny should be extended to a definite penny. Summary Jurisdiction Repeal, &c., Bill.—This Bill proposed to assimilate the procedure for the exercise of jurisdiction conferred on Justices by the various Summary Jurisdiction Acts. It will be remembered that in 1880 some of the Middlesex Magistrates declined to continue the old procedure, on the ground that they were precluded from doing so by the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1879; that a friendly action was brought against Mr. J. B. Price, one of the Magistrates, in the Queen's Bench, for the settlement of the point, when it was decidcd that the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1879 did not apply to the recovery of rates. It appeared that Clause 7 of this year's Bill would have the effect of abrogating the decision in this case, and in that event, rates would become civil debts, and the enforcement of them would become subject to all the provisions of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The Vestry were of opinion that the present method of procedure is simple and works well, and they therefore communicated with the Borough Members and others, with the view of getting rates exempted from the provisions of the Bill. Other Local Authorities took the same course, and the necessary Clause was inserted before the Bill became law. United Telephone Company's Bill.—This Company introduced a Bill for the purpose of obtaining power to lay wires under or over streets in the Metropolis. Owing to the 25 extensive powers sought by the Company, one of which was to suspend wires over the public streets without the consent of the Local Authorities, provided such wires were above the height of the fronts of the houses ; great opposition was offered by the various authorities affected. This Yestry passed a resolution that it was undesirable that any private Bill should pass, but that it is desirable that the Government should introduce a Public Bill upon the subject of general application giving Local Authorities the power to deal with the question. London Government Bill.—The Government, in the Queen's Speech at the commencement of the Session, again announced their intention of introducing a Bill for the reform of the Government of the Metropolis, but at Ladyday, the date to which this Report extends, the Bill had not been introduced. The Vestry, however, appointed delegates to a Conference at St. Marylebone upon the subject, where a resolution was passed, declaring the conviction of the Conference of the importance of local control in parochial government, and that they view with anxiety and proposal to interfere with the principle of autonomy in local affairs, and adjourning the further consideration of the question until the Bill is introduced. Baths and Washhouses,—In January last, the question of the adoption of the Baths and Washhouses Acts, was once more brought before the Yestry, and a Committee was appointed to obtain information as the working of the Public Baths and Washhouses already established, in continuation of the Report thereon of 1874, to ascertain if a suitable site can be obtained within the Parish, and to consider the advisability of the adoption of Acts by the Yestry. The Committee had inspected a number of the Establishments in London, but had presented no Keport at the 25th March, when this Report closes. 26 Free Libraries Acts. The Vestry have also appointed a Committee to consider the desirability of adopting the Free Libraries Acts. Meetings.—The following is the number of Meetings of the Vestry and the various Committees held during the year Board 48 Committee of Works, including Subcommittees 38 Sanitary Committee, inelnding SubCommittees 29 Assessment Committee 12 Finance Committee 8 Parliamentary Committee 5 Special Committees 15 Lighting Committee 11 By Order, ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.

Slopping.—During the year 3,837 loads of street sweepings were removed from the Parish, 186 of which were collected late on Saturday nights. 90 freights of slop were disposed of, 82 being sold for £85 15s., and eight being removed free. Watering.—The watering was done mainly by the Vestry's staff, but for 50 days an average .of six horses per day were hired of Mr. Stubbs for the purpose. Cartage.—The horses and carts have also been employed during the year in carting stone, gully refuse, &c., the cost of which, reckoning the horse, cart, and man at 12/6 per day, would have amounted to £234 14s.

To the Vestry of the Parish of Saint James and Saint John, Olerkenwell. Surveyor's Office, Yestry Hall, Olerkenwell, 12th June, 1884. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Report, upon the Works, &c., executed by your Yestry during the year ending Lady-day, 1884. SEWERS AND GULLIES. Fifty-four Sewers were cleansed and repaired, and 122 loads of soil removed; two new side entrance covers were fixed, 22 new gullies were constructed, 310 cleansed and repaired, and seven were trapped. Nineteen new air grates were fixed. One new air shaft was constructed in Cyrus Street. 46 HOUSE DRAINAGE. The total number of premises drained were 84, the details of which drainage is shewn upon 52 plans prepared for that purpose, and deposited in the Surveyor's Office; these drains consist of 34 9-inch, and 39 6-inch. Nino old drains were trapped. PAVEMENTS. Carriageways.—The carriageway of Pentonville Road, between Penton Street and the Parish boundary at King's Cross (outside the Tramway limits), was paved with new Aberdeen Granite, and the carriageways of the following streets with dressod Granite:— Pine Street, Merlin's Place, Vineyard Walk, part of Baker's Row, Cross Street, Short's Buildings, part of Red Lion Street, Cierkenwell Close, Clark Street, part of Brunswick Close, part of Coldbath Square, Spencer Place, Winchester Street, and Rosoman Street, between Kxmouth Street and Corporation Row. With Val do Travers Compressed Asphalte— Hay ward's Place. Footways.—The footways of Pine Street, Vineyard Walk, part of Cierkenwell Close, part of Red Lion Street, Cross Street, Pentonville Road, south side between Claremont Square and King's Cross Road, Spencer Place, Rosoman Street, between Exmouth Street and Corporation Row, were relaid, the defi 47 ciency being made up with new York, and in Pentonville Road with Patent Victoria Stone. With Yal de Travers Mastic Asphalte—Field Court, and James's Gardens, Chapel Street. MISCELLANEOUS. Goswell Road, Maintenance of. — Complaints having been made and great inconvenience arising as to the maintenance and repair of the carriageway of Goswell Road, an arrangement was made with St. Luke's Yestry, that that Yestry should take entire charge of that portion of the carriageway of Goswell Road south of Seward Street, and the Yestry of Cierkenwell should take entire charge of that portion north of Seward Street. The carriageways of the following streets were relaid with broken Granite, and rolled with a steam roller:—Northampton Square, Charles Street, Upper Charles Street, Rodney Street, between Pentonville Road and Henry Street, Great Percy Street, between King's Cross Road and Percy Circus, and Percy Circus, for which and including jobbing works 1,756 yards of broken Granite were used, of which 1,632 yards were broken by the Yestry's employes. JOBBING WORKS. For the maintenance and general repair of the carriageway and footways of the Parish the following materials have been used, in addition to the above:— 48 Two tons of new Granite were laid. Ballast 248 cube yards Hoggin 118 „ Sand 254 „ Shingle 54 „ 6,682 ft. sup. new York laid. (Of which 763 ft. were for the various Companies) 59,882 ft. sup. old York relaid. (Of which 12,330ft. were for the various Companies) 59 ft. sup. new Patent Victoria Stone was laid. (Of which 10 ft. were for the various Companies) 495 ft. sup. Patent Victoria Stone relaid. (Of which 46 ft. were for the various Companies) 32 ft. run new Kerb fixed. (Of which 5 ft. were for the various Companies) 2,778 ft, run Kerb reset. (Of which 202 ft. were for the various Companies) 13,150 yds. sup. Granite relaid. (Of which 3,016 yds. were for the various Companies) 844 yds. sup. Pebbles relaid. (Of which 150 yds. were for the various Companies) 397 yds. sup. York edging laid. 511 yds. sup. Ballast, and 1,529 yds. Macadam were also laid for the various Companies. 92 plates were cut into stones over coal vaults by the Yestry's workmen at the expense of the owners of the vaults. 49 STREET REFUGE. One Street Refuge was constructed in Spencer Street by Goswell Road. COURT FLUSHING. The Courts and Alleys in the Parish were washed at night and sprinkled with Carbolic Acid from August 8th to September 5th. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Pentonville Road was lighted by the Maxim-Weston Electric Company, with their incandescent lamps till the 13th June, but this system of lighting being considered unsatisfactory, the Company, at their own expense, placed 10 arc lights, of an estimated power of 1500 candles each, in lieu of the incandescent lamps. It was, however, considered by the Yestry unadvisable to continue the lighting of this thoroughfare with Electric Light after the 27th September, and it has been since lighted with Gas. STREET WATERING. The Street Watering was done by the Vestry's own vans, extra horses being hired as required, 4,538,000 gallons of water being used, the amount paid for which, including rent of meters, was £251 lis. lid. URINALS. One 4-stall Urinal was erected in St. John's Square. 50 The whole of the Urinals in the Parish were tarred, and were cleansed twice daily till August, when it being considered desirable to maintain a more efficient cleansing, an additional urinal flusher was put on, and from that time every urinal has been cleansed thrice daily. I have the honor to remain, Gfntlemen Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM IRON, Surveyor. 51 REPORT of MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR 1883. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honor of laying before you my 28th Annual Report, viz.:—That for the year 1883. The number of deaths occurring from all causes in Clerkenwell, during the year 1883, was 1172. The annual average for the last 10 years was 1344, so that the deaths were 172 less than the average. The deaths in 1882 having been 1261, those in 1883 were 89 less than in the preceding year. 52 The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last 10 years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— deaths. births. 1874 1,417 2,565 1875 1,539 2,505 1876 1,342 2,559 1877 1,385 2,522 1878 1,303 2,590 1879 1,456 2,667 1880 1,313 2,430 1881 1,254 2,414 1882 1,261 2,420 1883 1,172 2,402 The births were thus 18 loss than in the preceding year, and 105 less than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 316 634 318 Amwell 326 630 304 Pentonville 244 520 276 Goswell 286 618 332 In each year, a number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals. There has hitherto been no means of accurately ascertaining these, I have therefore been obliged to estimate the proportion of them from the known number occurring in all the institutions in the metropolis, in relation to the inhabitants. An annual estimate of these has always been given for the last 27 years. The estimated number for 1883 amounts to 104. As the deaths occurring in the Workhouse and Infirmary are not registered in the parish, an estimate of them must also be made, from the known number occurring in all the institutions of the Holborn Union, in relation to the number of paupers belonging to Clerkenwell. 53 Determined in this way, the intraparochial mortality for the year has been 16.9; including the estimated hospital deaths, 18; and the Workhouse and Infirmary deaths 22 per 1,000. But I feel certain that these estimates are too high; and in fact, the Vestry, who are always ready to do everything to advance the sanitary state of the parish, having agreed to pay for the exact returns of extra parochial deaths which the RegistrarGeneral has kindly consented to furnish, I find that these amounted to 44 for the first quarter of the present year, and this is a heavy quarter. I consider that by adding 200 to the deaths occurring in the parish, which makes the mortality 19.8, say 20 per 1,000, we obtain the true rate of mortality. The mortality for all London during the year was 20.4; that of the West Districts 19.5; for the North Districts 19.1; for the Central Districts 23.2; for the East Districts 24.1; and for the South Districts 19.4. Hence taking the highest estimate of the mortality of Clerkenwell, it is below the average of its own group of districts, as well as much below the worst districts. But it is really monstrous to compare the mortality of the most densely massed, if not overcrowded Central Districts, especially when, as the School Board inspector says, over 30 per cent of the parents are out of work, 40 per cent of the poor children come to school without a breakfast, and 40 per cent without a dinner, with that of the sparse and scattered population of other districts of the metropolis, where ample food and every care and luxury are present. In this comparison, Clerkenwell, with its 180 persons per acre, has to compete with Kensington and its 79, and Marylebone (Cavendish Square) with its 103 per acre. And everyone knows that the class of occupants is totally different. In future years, this matter will be put upon a positive basis. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1883, was 215; being 45 less than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of the zymotic deaths taking place in Clerkenwell during the last ten years, are exhibited in the following table:— 54 SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. HOOPING COUGH. TYPHUS. DIARRHOEA. TOTALS. 1874 2 63 71 38 31 55 260 1875 2 36 76 82 24 58 278 1876 2 48 34 41 12 73 210 1877 15 73 82 36 25 53 284 1878 1 39 41 56 25 73 235 1879 1 74 44 61 11 36 227 1880 2 26 51 87 14 65 245 1881 10 39 54 53 26 58 240 1882 0 61 60 81 18 40 260 1883 0 61 46 33 16 59 215 The average number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years, was 225; so that the number for 1883 was 10 less than the average. The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age, was 367; the same as in the preceding year. 192 deaths occurred at and above 60; 25 more than in the previous year. 98 inquest-deaths were registered in the year, being 12 less than in the preceding year. 55 7 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; 2 in the House of Detention. 30 deaths arose from violence; the number for 1882 being 34. The numbers for the last six years were 40, 43, 38, 41, 34, and 30, so that the number for this year is seven less than the average. I have stated my estimate of mortality in page . In 20 large English towns, the mortality in 1883 was:—London, 20.4; Brighton, 19.2; Portsmouth, 18.6; Norwich, 19.7; Plymouth, 20.9, Bristol, 17.9; Wolverhampton, 21.3; Birmingham, 21.4; Leicester, 19.4; Nottingham, 21.3; Liverpool, 26.7; Manchester. 27.6; Salford, 22.4; Oldham, 22.0; Bradford, 18.4; Leeds, 23.3; Sheffield, 23.0; Hull, 22.8; Sunderland, 24.5; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 25.5. The intraparochial mortality in Clerkenwell for the year 1883 has been less than that during any other year since the existence of the Vestry. It has been stated that the deaths from the principal zymotic diseases were less than the average. No deaths from Small Pox occurred in the Parish. Two cases came to knowledge during the year. The deaths from Measles were the same as in the preceding year; those from Scarlet Fever were less. The deaths from Hooping Congh were considerably less; those from Typhus and Typhoid Fever slightly less; those from Diarrhœa more. Of the 46 deaths included under Scarlet Fever, 10 are registered as arising from Diphtheria. Two of the Fever cases were attributed to Typhus, 11 to Typhoid, and 3 to common continued Fever. Slaughter-houses,—These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself on October 29th, and November 5th, The slaughter-houses in use, were 15; 6 in the three Upper Wards, and 9 in the lower, and were kept by the same number of butchers. They were generally in excellent condition, slight imperfections in the cementing of the joints of the paving being the only defects. 56 Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 19; 11 in the upper Wards, and 8 in the lower, and were kept by 17 cow-keepers. The cows numbered 248; 129 in the Upper Wards, and 119 in the lower. The cow-houses were mostly in very good order, a few defects in paving and cementing being noticed; and in one, insufficient ventilation. The cows were very fine animals, and in excellent condition. Bake-houses.—By the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, the duty of enforcing the provisions of the Act in regard to bake-houses, has been withdrawn from the Government Inspector, and transferred to the Local Authority, i.e., the Vestry, and, by the same Act, certain regulations were laid down, in regard to new bake-houses. These were:—1, that no watercloset, earth-closet, privy, or ash-pit, shall be within or communicate directly with the bake-house; 2, that any cistern for supplying water to the bake-house, shall bo separate and distinct from any cistern for supplying water to a water-closet; and 3, that no drain or pipe for carrying off fæcal or sewage matter shall shall have an opening within the bake-house. Although those regulations did not refer to existing bakehouses, the latter were carefully examined in regard to their state in these respects. They were inspected on the 19th of December last year, and January 14th of the present. They were (60 in all; 31 in the Upper Wards, and 29 in the lower. Many were in excellent order; some required limewhiting, the dirty appearance usually arising from gas smoke. In one, a W.C. was found in a loft, in close proximity to sacks of flour; in two cases, W.C.'s were found in outlets of bakehouses; and in one, the ventilating window opened directly into the bake-house; the closets were trapped. In another case, these was a powerful effluvium of sower gas from a sink, provided with a perfect cover, but its action was, prevented by pieces of rubbish. 57 Two important points were particularly dwelt upon by the Sanitary Committee, viz.:—the existence of four underground water cisterns; and a single cistern supplying a closet, and also yielding the bake-house water supply. The existence of the underground cisterns was noticed in former inspections. But as the water when drawn off was found to be clear, there did not appear to be any reason for their being done away with, although their existence must always be considered objectionable. Notices were served to remedy the faults observed, and they were mostly complied with; the closets in the loft and those connected with the bake-houses were done away with; also two of the underground cisterns; one is not used, the handle of the pump being removed; but in one case, the owner was obdurate, and summoned before the magistrate, who however refused to order it to be done away with, as no contamination of the water could be proved. The direct connexion of the closet with the water supply, where it existed, was in all cases cut off, by the interposition of a water-waste preventer. No child, young person, or woman, was found to be employed in any bake-house. Mortuary.—During the year, 271 bodies were brought to the Mortuary. Of these, 96 were brought for inquest purposes, upon which 42 post-mortems were made; 108 were Holborn Union cases, all belonging to Clerkenwell; and 67 were brought from the houses of parishioners, including 15 cases of Fevers, and where the corpses would otherwise have remained in living rooms. In November of the year, in consequence of a corpse having been kept in the Mortuary for 15 days, from some mal-arrangement between the friends and the Relieving Officer, a so called "Mortuary scandal" arose. My attention was not specially drawn to the case. The Guardians are bound to bury any corpse which is dangerous to health, under a magistrate's order, which can be readily obtained. The Relieving Officer knew of the 58 case, and should have had it buried at once. The "scandal," so called by one of the Guardians who originated the application of the term, ended with them, for they had to bury the corpse after all, as they should have done at first. Artizans' Dwellings Acts.—When the Artizans' Dwellings Act (Torrens') came into force in 1868, I made representations of certain bad courts, which appeared to me to come within the scope of the law. These were considered by the Vestry, and the legal notices served, and a few houses were demolished and re-built. But it was found that the newly constructed houses were so closely placed, that little or no real benefit was derived, and no further proceedings were taken. When the Artizans' Dwellings Act (Cross) came into force in 1875, which was all that was desired, being of a much more sweeping character, I again made representations in regard to several Courts and Places, in some of which the mortality was very great, while in others it was not so, yet the buildings were too closely crowded, veritable slums, causing much social evil and misery. The then Sanitary Committee agreed with my representation, which was duly submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works, by whom, in my opinion, the whole should have been demolished and re-arranged. The Metropolitan Board took up two courts and made a scheme—the Pear Tree Court Scheme, and the houses have been pulled down, and new blocks of Peabody Buildings erected. The number of persons displaced was 450, for whom the Act required new provision; the new buildings however, accommodate 1150. Seven of the courts I condemned were pulled down for new street improvements. I also decided that some other courts should follow the preceding, and these were inspected by the Sanitary Committee. But as the Metropolitan Board did not proceed with the first instalment I did not make a representation to them. The Metropolitan Board, finding an outcry against the enormous expense which the schemes they made caused, declined to proceed further, and a new Act limited their 59 powers to courts containing more than 10 houses. Since that, at the suggestion of the Local Government Board to the Vestries, to require their Medical Officer's attention to the courts which were dangerous to health, I considered the matter, and again made representations of the same courts and parts of courts under Torrens' Act. The Sanitary Committee viewed these courts, and the Vestry have taken the legal proceedings required in regard to 11 of them, viz.:—Bishop's Court, Smith's Place, John's Place, Exmouth Place, Bolton Court, Margaret Court, Rhode's Buildings, Union Place, Slade's Place, Fox Terrace, and 3 houses in Eagle Court, which are now under consideration by the Vestry. In July of the year, as the Cholera was very prevalent in Egypt, and considering the great traffic between that country and England, alarm arose, lest the disease should be brought to our shores, and so be spread among us. Our Vestry, as I believe were all others in the Metropolis, was at once supplied with a set of rules or orders, by the Local Government Board, as has always been done in former visitations of that epidemic. The Vestry immediately took up the matter, and I drew up a handbill as follows:— Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. SANITARY PRECAUTIONS. The Inhabitants of the Parish are earnestly advised to take the following precautions during the present season of the year:— 1. Drainage, Refuse, &c.—To give notice at the Vestry Hall of Defective Drainage, Choked Drains, or Offensive Water Closets; of Accumulations of House Refuse, or other Decaying Animal or Vegetable matters. It is also most important to burn all Vegetable Refuse. 2. Ventilation.—To keep the houses clean and well Ventilated, especially the Sleeping Rooms. 3. Water Supply.—To clean out the Water Butts frequently; to give notice at the Vestry Hall of defective supply; and especially of any communication between the Waste-water pipe and the Water Closet. 4. Improper Food.—To avoid eating Unripe or Stale Fruit, Stale Fish, or Tainted Meat; also to be temperate in the use of Ale, Beer, or other fermented Liquors. 5. Diarrhoea.—To obtain medicine, or seek medical advice immediately diarrhœa comes on. 60 6. Sinks.—To pour water daily down the sinks, and keep on the covers of the sinks. 7. Disinfectants.—To throw disinfectants, especially carbolic acid, into water closets, sinks, and offensive yards. (As carbolic acid is poisonous, particular care should be taken to place tho word "poison" upon every bottle or package containing same.) 8. Dustbins.—To give notice immediately of any accumulation in the dustbin. As Cholera is prevailing abroad, and may possibly be brought here, it may be well pointed out that, in former visitations, when attention has been paid to the above precautions, its advent has been harmless, but when they have been neglected, severe mortality has ensued. By order of the Sanitary Committee. J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry. Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, July 30th, 1883. Carbolic acid may be obtained free by the Poor on application at the Vestry Hall. 10,000 of these bills were distributed, one or more in every house in the Parish. Arrangements were also made by the Local Government Board, in conjunction with the Asylum Boards, in regard to providing and arranging the Hospital accommodation, the ordering of proper ambulances, &c., which would be requisite in case of a visitation of the epidemic; and a map was prepared, showing the position of the several Institutions where Cholera cases would be received in the event of an outbreak. Fortunately, we have so far been spared; yet the arrangements are still in order. How, in spite of what was then done, and what has always been done, under similar circumstances, Sir William Harcourt could assert, in the House of Commons, that in the event of an epidemic occurring in the Metropolis, there was no uniformity of action, and no central guiding power over the Vestries and Local Boards, seems to mo only Intelligible on the plea that he is a special pleader in a cause. A list of our poorer courts and streets was also made out, and the inspection of these was handed over to the three inspectors, who were to report upon any sanitary defects found 61 therein. The attendance of two of the inspectors upon the dusting and slopping was discontinued, pro. tem., for the purpose, these duties being transferred to a separate person for the time. By this proceeding houses of the poorer class were examined and their condition reported upon, and the usual notices served for the removal of nuisance and defects where found to exist, and followed up until they were remedied. During the last month or two, the "bitter cry" has awoke the ground landlords, who are enforcing thorough ornamental repairs, painting the houses, laying on water to the closets, and papering the rooms and stair-cases. The latter part, I consider a decided mistake, and, as I pointed out in a former report, the rooms and stair-cases should be done in distemper, so as to keep down vermin, and allow of their being re-done when infectious diseases breaks out. Overcrowding.—We not unfrequently find instances of overcrowding, which are at once attended to, a certain time being necessarily allowed for the removal of the persons concerned, and their finding new lodgings. There is no law to prevent overcrowding, except it be proved to be injurious to health. But our rule has been for many years, that 300 cubic feet per head is the proper requirement, some allowance being made where some of the family are young children. One case of Typhoid Fever was sent to Hospital during the year, by a Magistrate's Order, in consequence of the family living in one overcrowded room. Our notices are always obeyed when served, but some instances may escape us, and can hardly be expected not to exist. Besides, considering the way in which the poor live, with doors open summer and winter, I believe too much ventilation kills far more than insufficient, especially among children. Underground Kitchens.—Several of these, illegally occupied, have been discovered and emptied during the year. But we do not receive the two reports per year of the total number in the Parish, which the District Surveyor is bound to furnish to tho Vestry. Several of them have been occupied 62 for years, but these so nearly correspond with the Act and are in such good condition, that it has not been considered desirable to interfere with them. Closets without water-supply.—We have a large number of these in the Parish, but have no power to order a water-supply, except its absence causes a nuisance; when this is the case, it is at once ordered, and the order is always complied with. The complaint that no water is laid on to waterclosets rests upon an idea—that water should be laid on to all closets. But why? If any nuisance arises from its absence, it can be, and is, at once ordered. But if the closets are kept clean and wholesome by suitable flushing, where is the necessity for a separate water-supply? It can only save the trouble of the flushing. In many instances during the year, a water-supply has been laid on, where we have simply served a preliminary notice. When the inhabitants form a rough population, the water-supply is of little use, as the fittings form playthings for the children, and are soon broken. However, the slop-water keeps the closets clear. We have many stopped-up closets in the year, but the stoppage is always found to be caused by pieces of flannel, old brushes, &c., carelessly thrown into the pan, with the slops; except in cases where the tenants are turned out, when bricks and rubbish are thrown in, smashing the pan, to pay out the landlord. But ours is not the only Parish in which the closets are without water. For, at a late meeting of the Islington Vestry, the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, in answer to questions put to him, stated that it was not considered a sanitary defect for closets to be without a fixed water-supply, inasmuch as many of these closets were kept in a better condition than those which had a fixed water-supply. The Chairman said the Medical Officer told him, that he did consider it a defect for closets to be without a fixed water-supply, but he had no power to take action in the matter until a nuisance had been proved. 63 The Retrograde Parish.—In the Times for January 26th, the report of a speech made by Sir Charles Dilke having been published, in which the Parish of Clerkenwell is denounced as one of the retrograde metropolitan parishes, from the existence of overcrowding of the poor in unsanitary and dilapidated dwellings. I felt bound to express to the Vestry, my opinion that this statement is not founded upon fact, if intended to apply to the sanitary condition of the parish, which has always been better and with a lower death-rate than that of other parishes in the same group, which moreover is not the group with the greatest mortality. At the same time I pointed out that for some years past many of the well-to-do residents of the Parish have been gradually leaving their houses, which become occupied by a poorer class of people, many of the houses which were formerly held by one family, being now let to several. When these poorer and rough people, especially the labourers, enter a house, at once begins a course of dirt and destruction. The locks and handles of the doors become toys for the children and are soon demolished. The drain traps are sold at the bone and bottle shops, those left are never kept on, the closets are stopped up and the pans are broken. The chimneys are never swept, so that the rooms become black and disfigured. The paper is torn off the walls, the floors and passages are never washed, and there are no door mats, so that the whole place becomes a mass of dirt and destruction. The water-butt lids and the dust-bin lids are used for firewood, the ball cocks are broken off, so that there is great water waste, which floods the yards and washes away the cement from the paving. The very handrails of the stair-cases are broken away, and even the walls are picked out with nails or something of the kind, so as to leave large holes. The windows are constantly broken and stopped up with brown paper; in fact, there exists in every parish, a juvenile window breaking club, the members of which demolish every pane of glass they can, especially in empty houses. As the better houses are becoming filled with these families, the prospect is truly not favorable; moreover, a population of 64 ice-sellers, and French organ-grinders is gradually creeping into the parish from Holborn, whose habits are filthy and unsanitary in the extreme. These disorderly people and their children require proper training, which I hoped years ago, would have been acquired by means the School Board; but it has not occurred. In fact, many women, who when young, have been in service, and have kept an eight-roomed house in perfect order under a mistress, when living in one or two rooms of their own, allow them to become a mass of dirt. Let us hope however, that a better state of things may come, but it is evident that many of the newly proposed "Regulations" for improvements refer rather to condition of ornamental repair of the dwellings than to requirements of health. In fact, after daily inspection of the dwellings of the poor for more than 40 years, and hearing the remarks made upon them, I cannot help thinking, that those who legislate in the matter should be landlords, for a time at least, to enable them to become acquainted with the relation of repairs to reckless damage. At all events, it is evident, that the condition of the Parish, described as worse than it has ever been before, does not relate to its sanitary condition; which, through the incessant labours of the Vestry, has continued to improve, in spite of the increase of a lower class of population. Moreover, when it is recollected, that our worst courts, the terrible Turnmill Street courts, Ledbury Place, Wood's Place, Suffolk Court, Caroline Court, and many others have been demolished, and replaced by the fine model buildings—Corporation Buildings, Farringdon Buildings, Compton Buildings, Cobden Buildings, and Peabody Buildings, and that several hundreds of underground kitchens have been emptied, not to mention the innumerable drainage, water supply, and other defects, which have been remedied during past years, to say that the condition of the Parish is not improving, is monstrous—it is not true. 65 Moreover, the Police Authorities have power, where the Vestry fails in duty, as have also the Privy Council, and the Metropolitan Board of Works. But although the Police have occasionally, hut very rarely, given notice of nuisances, neither of these authorities has ever found it necessary to exercise their power in Clerkenwell. In a subsequent letter, addressed to the Yestry, in reply to a letter sent to him upon this subject, Sir Charles Dilke stated, that having visited the whole of tho 39 Districts of tho Metropolis, he considers that the evils to which he pointed were greater in Clerkenwell than in any of the others. Sir Charles also supported his statement by the evidence of two clergymen of the Parish, and four School Board visitors. Now, anyone would have thought, that if these gentlemen were sincere and aware of a number of terrible nuisances existing in the Parish, they would have reported them to the Vestry, by whose officers all nuisances are at once attended to as soon as discovered or entered in the complaint book. But what is the fact? During the past year, we have had about 20 notices of the occurrence of zymotic diseases—Hooping Cough, Measles, and Scarlet Fever, from the School Board Officers, found out by children not attending school, and one stopped-up W.C., but not a single complaint of overcrowding or bad sanitary condition of dwelling. Sir Charles Dilke also states, "that there were 14 house farmers in the Vestry, and 12 publicans, who seemed to work very much with them, and that state of things had undoubtedly led to insufficient care being taken by the Vestry of the condition of the Parish." Assuming the above numbers to be correct, although they are not so, they form but a small portion of the total number, which is 72. 26 have little chance of carrying on their evil ways against the remaining 46, even were they so disposed. But I deny that these members have ever exerted an interference with the sanitary proceedings of the Parish. The complaints and nuisances have always for years back been reported upon, and where the law permitted, if they were not remedied, legal proceedings wove taken, 66 Dr. Tripe, at the Health Exhibition Conference, also agrees with me when he points out the differences observable in the two classes of the poor. "Persons of the class he would call the residuum, many of whom were disgustingly filthy and destructive in their habits, and who could scarcely be said to have any sanitary domestic arrangements whatever." Again, "due care must be taken by the inspector, that while too much zeal was not displayed, yet nuisances injurious to health were not allowed to remain." Again, "the position of the landlord or middleman (the house-farmer and publican?) was often by no means an enviable one, as it was most disheartening to him to find dustbins broken, the water-supply apparatus damaged, the walls defaced, and his property injured almost immediately after it had been put in good order." In my opinion, if the habits of a poorer class could be altered, so that they should respect property, especially that of their dwellings, and should keep themselves, their apartments and their clothes, in a proper cleanly state, we should hear no irrational complaints about "Regulations" and "house-farmers and publicans." Clerkenwell is a retrograde Parish! If so, how is it that the Rateable value has increased from £195,000 in 1856, to £350,000 in 1883; this does not seem to show that the public consider it so, and are afraid to invest and deposit property in the Parish. Again, when we find that thousands of dirty children have been collected from playing and idling in the streets and gutters, and are brought to our Board Schools, where they must present a somewhat cleanly and decent appearance; does this indicate a retrograde condition? Does the building of the large number of Model Dwellings, which has been effected during the last few years, show that the public are afraid to invest in a deteriorating Parish, where it is alleged that 40 per cent. of the people are out of work, and where therefore there must be no chance of getting their rents? 67 The dirty state of the tenants and their goods, is a very difficult matter to obviate. We have lady-visitors who administer most kindly to the sick poor, giving them delicacies, flowers, &c. But I have never found them interfere with the dirty and offensive state of their homes. In fact, I feel sure, that if they were to attempt this, their presence would not be welcome or even tolerated. We have had lately also, notices of defects found by some lady-visitors from a Mansion House Committee, some of these are curious: that certain houses are built partly of brick and partly of wood. I do not recollect ever seeing one not so. Several complaints also of no water to closets, and absence of traps to sinks in yards (perhaps stolen the week before.) Although we have not power to remedy these, they will add up as nuisances in our condemned Parish. But again, no complaints of internal personal dirt. To attempt to remedy these defects by law, seems to me ridiculous. They should be altered by some female visitation and exhortation. Does not the building of a beautiful Mortuary, one of, if not the best in London, at a cost of nearly £3,000, and which is of sole use for the poor, show that the Vestry are not governed by such so-called "house-farmers and publicans," as are stated to have no feeling for the poor? Does not the providing a new and expensive Wharf, with first-rate horses and carts, to cause a better removal of the dust and refuse from the Parish, and which has been and is an immense improvement, show that the Vestry are striving their utmost to benefit the Parish in every way? In a former Annual Report, I abstracted a Table from the Registrar-General's Returns, on the comparative Mortality of the several London Parishes, perhaps the most perfect ever made, in which the deaths in Hospitals were distributed over the several districts, and corrected for the deaths in Workhouses situated out of the districts to which they belong. In this 68 Table, Clerkenwell was not only not at the bottom, but only 11 from the top. And curiously enough, Chelsea was 27 from the top, and only 11 from the bottom. Perhaps this is the reason why the Chelsea Members of Parliament are so earnestly forcing on the new Municipal Bill, with a view to its improving the sanitary condition of their Parish. It would be interesting, and perhaps instructive, to inquire whether Chelsea has yet overtaken or come up to Clerkenwell in its sanitary condition. In conclusion, I cannot but express my opinion, that the sanitary or general condition of Clerkenwell, instead of being retrograde, has been for years improving and is greatly improved. Anyone may, now and then, go around and find something wrong, from tenants' damage or mischief, such as overflow of water from the ball-cocks being stolen, and washing away of the cementing of the paving, the stoppage of a closet, the overcrowding of a room, and the specially dirty state of some old woman, or the occupation of an underground kitchen, where there is no real reason why it should be interfered with. But because this is the case, to condemn a Parish as retrograde, I consider wrong, cruel, absolutely untrue, and injurious to the working men; for who will employ a man when it is known that he comes from the retrograde Parish of Clerkenwell? No wonder that 40 per cent. of the men are out of employment. I have, therefore, no hesitation in saying, that the "bitter cry" does not apply to the Parish of Clerkenwell. If the Chairman of the Local Government Board, had really for his motive, the testing of the action of the Vestry, as regulated by the control of the House-farmers and Publicans, why did he not have 10 or 20 so-called nuisances entered in our complaint book, and see what the result would have been? I am perfectly certain that all real nuisances, i.e. legal nuisances, would have been remedied, as they always are, under the simple serving of our preliminary notices, and without their ever coming before the House-farmers, &c., at all. 69 When the late Chairman of the Sanitary Committee states that there are several houses with only one closet, he should have stated that these were condemned, by me, and by the Vestry in 1875, and referred to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and remained in their hands until last year, when they threw them up. I again condemned them, under Torrens' Act, my condemnation was supported by the Sanitary Committee and the Vestry, and they are now under the ordinary legal process of that Act, to be finally dealt with; although such condition is distinctly permitted by the 81st Section of the Metropolis Management Act. Sanitary Proceedings.—The ordinary course of these is, that all complaints of nuisances entered in the Vestry's complaint book, are at once attended to by the three inspectors. When in case of infectious disease is reported, the case is examined into. If removed, the premises are disinfected, the beds baked in the oven, and handbills on precautionary measures are left in the house. If not, the case is watched until the patient is sufficiently recovered, when the same measures are adopted. Carbolic acid is freely distributed, and a sheet saturated with the same is nailed up outside the door of the infected room. Any corpse found in a living room is at once removed to the mortuary, if necessary by a magistrates order. Only one such was required during the year. Instances of overcrowding are remedied as soon as the time required for the finding of fresh lodgings has elapsed. In the warm weather, carbolic acid water is used for watering the streets, the gullies are disinfected twice a week; and the various courts are also flushed and disinfected twice weekly. The carbolic acid used last year in these proceedings cost more than £130. The Meteorology of the year was as follows:— 70 1883. Temperature, Average. Difference from average of 42 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation == 100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 42 years. Year 49.4 0.0 43.6 82 29.7 21.9 —0.69 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., March) 40.0 + 0.1 35.2 83 29.7 5.36 + 0.35 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 53.0 + 0.1 45.3 77 29.8 4.75 —1.08 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 59.5 —0.7 53.2 80 29.7 6.53 —0.12 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 44.9 + 0.4 40.8 86 29.8 5.26 —1.93 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year was exactly that of the average; the Winter, Spring, and Autumn quarters being slightly above the average, while the Summer quarter was below. These conditions are favourable to health; for a mild winter favours a diminution of deaths from Pulmonary diseases, while a cool summer diminishes the deaths from Diarrhœa; and these two diseases are very important considerations in the mortality of a Parish.

"The Clerk called attention to the fact that since "the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Rate, which "duty had reverted to the Guardians or Governors of "the Poor under the Local Act, and which Board had "been revived for the purpose in November, 1871, "there was no Poor.rate Account published, except "the remainder of those in collection by the Vestry "previous to that time, and suggested whether it would "not be desirable, by an agreement between both "Boards, to publish the Poor Rate Account of the "Guardians or Governors as an appendix to the Annual "Reports of the Vestry, in which case there would bo "one and a half years' Poor Rate Account to be "appended to the Report about to be issued for the " year ended Lady.day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by " Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved and "adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.

The following Table will serve to show the comparative mortality of Clerkenwell with that of the other Districts of the Metropolis. It represents the mean proportion of deaths occurring anuually in 100,000 persons living, during the 10 years 1851-60, corrected for the deaths in Hospitals by distributing them proportionally over the several Districts, and corrected also for the deaths in Workhouses situated out of the Districts to which they belong. Rothbury 1,475 Newington 2,426 Hampstead 1,760 Greenwich 2,449 Lewisham 1,787 Strand 2,456 Hackney 1.880 West London 2,495 St. George, Hanover Sq. 1,891 Rotherhithe 2,527 Kensington 1,985 Stepney 2,553 Islington 2,095 Mile End Wandsworth 2,194 Westminster 2,581 London (City) 2,222 Chelsea 2,615 Pancras 2,232 Bermondsey 2,638 St. James, Westminster 2,290 Holborn 2,641 Clerkenwell 2,309 St. Luke 2,736 Camberwell 2,319 St. George, Southwark 2,744 2,762 St. Martin-in-the-Fields 2,345 East London Bethnal Green 2,352 Whitechapel 2,841 Lambeth 2,353 St. Giles 2,846 Poplar 2,359 St. Olave, Southwark 2,863 Marylebone 2,404 St. Saviour Shoreditch 2,421 St. George-in-the-East 2,879 I have headed the Table with the mortality of the District of Rothbury, in Northumberland, which is the smallest of any district in Englaud and Wales; its population amounts to very nearly that of our Goswell District. It is true that a rural district has many advantages over a densely crowded manufacturing district. For, in it, the inhabitants are scattered over more ground, and their habits are very different; they rise early in the morning, retiring early at night, and so avoiding the exposure to the excesses too often committed during late hours. They also breathe a purer air; the mothers are strong and hearty, and are enabled to suckle their children during the proper period; while the mothers in crowded parishes are too closely confined within doors; too often obliged to work and neglect their children, whence these are fed upon improper food.
