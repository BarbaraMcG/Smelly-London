The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings (excluding the Weekly meetings of the Dusting Committee at the Vestry's Stables) has been:— MEETINGS. YEARS. 1882-3. 1883-4. 1884-5. 1885-6. Vestry 22 22 21 22 Standing Committees 108 100 93 94 Special „ 6 10 10 9 TOTAL 136 132 124 125 The largest attendance at any Vestry Meeting was 61, the smallest 29, and the average about 40. In addition to the meetings at the Vestry Hall, however, there have been many subjects of more than local interest which have been the subject of conferences with other Boards, and, as will be seen hereafter, the Vestry have appointed delegates to represent their views, and have every reason to believe that the result of such conferences have proved most useful. The Vestry have to chronicle the death of Mr. Theodore Moore, who had been a resident in the Parish and an active member of the Vestry for a great number of years. Deaths & Resignations. Messrs. H. E. Swaffer and A. Lloyd, two of the members of the Vestry also sent in their resignations. During the year Mr. George Dutton, the Treasurer to the Vestry resigned his office, and Mr. Charles Fisher, the Manager of the Eastern Branch of the London and Westminster Bank has been appointed in his stead. Treasurer. 6 Churchwardens & Overseers. At the meeting of the Vestry on Easter Tuesday, 1885, Messrs. Alfred Furness and J. D. Kemp were again re-elected Churchwardens, and Messrs. C. H. Bardouleau, A. E. Wood, T. Cook and B. Cundick were elected Overseers for the ensuing year. Parliamentary. The Parliamentary Committee have again had before them, reports by the Clerk to the Vestry on nearly 100 Bills and proceedings in Parliament, to all of which they have given serious attention, and, upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Vestry took the steps mentioned in the following table with respect to the several proceedings therein mentioned. Session Title of Bill. Nature of Steps Taken. 1885 Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Petition in favor. Metropolis Management Amendment „ to amend. Hyde Park Corner „ against. Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) „ in favor, to House of Lords. Hampstead Heath Enlargement „ against 1886 Metropolitan Board of Works (Water Supply) „ in favor of part. Metropolitan Board of Works (Stacking of Firewood) „ against. Metropolitan Board of Works (Theatres, &c.) „ to amend to include all public buildings. Sale of Intoxicating Liquors on Sunday Petition against, Employers' Liability Act (1880) Amendment (No. 2) „ „ Metropolitan Street Improvement Act, 1877, Amendment „ „ Beer Adulteration „ in favor. In addition to those above mentioned attention was given to several other Bills mentioned in the previous annual report and which had not been wholly completed. Water. Companies. The question has at last been settled as to what is the "annual value" upon which Water Companies are entitled to base their charge, and it has been enacted that the new Rateable Value as it appears in the Valuation List is henceforth to be taken as such "annual value." This is one step in the right direction. Corpratn. of London Tower (Bridge.) The Vestry find the greatest pleasure in being able to report that the Corporation of London succeeded in getting Parliamentary sanction to enable them to construct a Bridge over the Thames at the Tower, and have since then taken such active steps in relation to the matter, that there is every prospect of the work being completed within the time (4 years) allowed by the Act. Metropolitan Man agement Amendment. Among the Bills was one for amending the Metropolis Management Acts and increasing the number of representatives at the Metropolitan Board of Works of certain of the Parishes in the Metropolis. The Vestry were of opinion that, before 7 proceeding to legislate on the subject, some enquiry should be made and principle adopted applicable to the whole Metropolis, so that no Parish should be without at least two representatives. The petition of the Vestry was to that effect but ultimately the bill was passed giving increased representation to several parishes besides those originally included therein. The question of cleansing the Hamlet, and disposing of the refuse has received the most careful consideration, and the Vestry have taken steps which they hope will for some time at all events, enable them to deal with it. Dusting & Cleansing. In the first place they have again hired, as yearly tenants, at £9o per annum rent, the wharf adjoining Devon Wharf in Emmott Street. In the next place they have purchased for £1000 about 20 acres of land at Edmonton, abutting upon the Lea Navigation, and have had a portion of it embanked so that the flood water is kept out and the rubbish enabled to be burnt. The Vestry, therefore, are now in a position to put the refuse into barges from the Wharf and take it to Edmonton direct. This mode of course will involve considerable expense but looking at almost entire impossibility of disposing of the rubbish near the Hamlet, it appeared the most economical. The Vestry borrowed the amount required to purchase the land. A portion of the and held of the Carpenters Co. having been filled in, an arrangement has been come to for giving up that portion to the Company at a proportionate reduction of the rent. The following statement gives the names of the persons who have supplied the corn and fodder for the Vestry's horses and the prices paid:— Date. Tenders accepted. Clover, 1st cut. Meadow Hay.

In January last the Vestry received a notice from the Commercial Gas Co. stating that after the 1st April, the price tor gas supplied to the public lamps would be reduced from £3: 16: 0 to £3: 12: 6 per lamp per annum. Lighting the Public Lamps. 8 Paving Streets. The Tender of Messrs. Mowlem & Co., for executing the paving works in Devonshire-street, and White Horse-lane, was accepted by the Vestry. The Vestry arc pleased to say that they were able to obtain the loan of £6,500 necessary for executing the works, at 3½ per cent. interest. The Vestry have resolved to re-lay the Asphalte Paving, in the Mile End-road, between Stepney-green and Jubilee-street, and have also in contemplation the paving of Globe-road, and Ben Jonson-road. Claims for compensation for Accidcnts, The Claims for compensations have not been so numerous. The fact that the Vestry were not prepared to pay compensation without careful investigation, and proof of their liability has no doubt in some measure tended to check the number of applications, which followed on the result of Blackmore's case being first known. In one case the party actually commenced proceedings, no doubt in the hope that the Vestry would try and make terms. The non-liability of the Vestry, however, appeared so clear that they determined to go to trial, and after the lapse of some time the action was dismissed for want of prosecution. As may be guessed the plaintiff possessed nothing which the Vestry could take to repay the expenses they had been put to. In one case only did the Vestry pay any compensation, and then only the sum of £3. Trafalgarsquare. As mentioned in the last report the Metropolitan Public Garden and Boulevard Association, applied to the Vestry to be allowed to lay out Trafalgar-square, and the request was acceded to. The Vestry then proceeded to make bye-laws for regulating the mode of user of the Square, and the same were confirmed by the Home Secretary, as provided by statute. Street Improvements. The Improvement of Sidney-street, Harford-street, Globeroad, and Bull-lane, have not been lost sight of. Application has been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works to widen Globe-road, as a Metropolitan Improvement. Tramways. During the year the Tramway lines generally throughout the Hamlet have been allowed to get into a bad state of repair, and the hard winter has rendered their condition worse than ever. Repeated communications having been addressed to the Company without any effect, the Vestry have now served a formal notice requiring the immediate repair of all the lines and unless the works are at once proceeded with the Vestry will certainly take the most stringent proceedings against the Company, which they legally can do. Whilst the Tramway is undoubtedly a great boon to the larger part of the community, it cannot be denied that, even if 9 kept in good repair, it necessarily causes harm to others, and, therefore, when the Company ignore what amount almost to friendly notices they must not complain if, when they compel the Vestry to act strictly, they find that it is an expensive operation. During the year Orders have been received from the Metropolitan Board of Works directing that:— Woolmore Street be re-named Baythorne Street, and Ashcroft Road re-numbered. Renaming & Renumbering of Streets. Applications have also been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works to make Orders that:— Blenheim Terrace Rayment Road Trinity Terrace and Morgan Street be re-named Morgan Street. Chapel Terrace and Upper Montague Street) „ Upper Montague Street. and that Cantrell Road Edinburgh Road Bale Street Harford Street Ely Terrace and Garden Street be severally re-numbered. The Tender of Mr. Finch, to execute the Jobbing Sewers work was again accepted. Sanitary. Jobbing Sewers Contract. The Sewer from Greenfield-street to Plummers-row has been re-constructed. Reconstruction of Sewers. The Vestry are pleased to be able to report that the clause in the Act of Parliament enabling the owner in certain cases where proceedings under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, had been taken to compel the local authority to purchase the property, has recently been repealed and the Vestry at once took advantage of the fact. Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Aft. Proceedings under the Act named have been taken in respect of the following properties:— 128, Carr Street. Norfolk House, Stepney Green. 5, 7 and 7½, Yalford Street. 13, Romford Street. 26 and 28 St. Dunstan's Road. 46 and 54, Wilson Street. 23, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32 and 33, South Grove. 2 and 3, Salmen Street. 40, Maplin Street. 8, Alma Road. 39, Wentworth Road. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30, Old Church Road. In all the cases, except that of Norfolk House, steps were taken by the owners to comply with the Orders. 10 Government Enquiry In the case of Norfolk House the owner has appealed to the Court of Quarter Sessions and an opportunity will now be afforded of seeing the delay which can be caused by a litigous person unless some terms be come to. From time to time during the year 1885 the local officers of the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor lodged a number of complaints with regard to alleged sanitary defects existing on various premises in the Hamlet. The complaints were investigated and such proceedings as the Vestry were advised they could legally and properly adopt were taken. These did not satisfy the Council, who ultimately lodged complaints with the Local Government Board, and in the result the Home Secretary appointed Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols as an Inspector, to hold an enquiry into the immediate Sanitary requirements of the Hamlet. The Home Secretary invited the Vestry to appoint two gentlemen to sit with the Inspector on the enquiry and the Vestry accordingly appointed Messrs. F. J. Wood and H. Cushen, but owing to illness the former was unfortunately unable to be present. The enquiry was opened on the nth of January, 1886. Several days were taken by the Inspector and Mr. Cushen, accompanied by the Medical Officer and local Hon. Sec. of the Council, and by the Surveyor, the Acting Medical Officer of Health, the Inspector of Nuisances and the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee of the Vestry, in inspecting the properties complained of. On the 18th January there was a public sitting held at the Vestry Hall, at which Mr. Thomas, (Barrister), appeared for the Mansion House Council, and Mr. Jutsum, the Clerk to the Vestry, for the Vestry, and several witnesses were examined, after which the enquiry closed. In March, 1886, Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols made his report, which is rather a lengthy document, and the Vestry have not considered it necessary to cause it to be printed, as a copy can be obtained, as a Parliamentary paper, from the Queen's Printers, at the small cost of 1½d. It may be well, however, to say that Mr. Cubitt Nichols states that the total number of houses complained of was 508 and that the alleged defects consisted of:— Water-closets without water supply 367 Water-closets with defective pans, &c. 72 Dust-bins wanting or defective 365 Defective cisterns 32 Defective gullies or sinks 168 Defective drains 61 Defective paving to yards 174 After stating the contentions urged in respect thereof by the several parties, Mr. Cubitt Nichols gives his own views on the several matters, which may be shortly summarised thus:— 11 1. That all the closets in the Hamlet are water-closets and not privies, and that they should be provided with a suitable water supply. 2. That moveable receptacles for dust should be provided, but, failing to get this done, the Vestry should insist on dustbins with covers being provided. 3. That the regulations made by the Vestry under the tary Act of 1866, with regard to houses let in lodgings or to members of more than one family, and approved by the Local Government Board, should be put in force in a greater number of cases. 4. That although the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwelling Act, 1863, had been put in force to some extent, further action thereunder ought to be taken in several streets mentioned. 5. That the staff of inspectors should be increased. 6. That additional powers are necessary in order to regulate the building of houses of the type of Norfolk House, Stepney-green. 7. That the death rate as given by the Medical Officer to the Vestry, showed that the death rate when compared with the rest of of the Metropolis was low considering the inhabitants are generally of the poorer classes, and that the death rate as contended for on behalf of the Mansion House Council shewed a still more favourable state of affairs. And speakinggenerally Mr. Cubitt Nichols reports "Although "I think it most desirable some additional sanitary precautions "should be adopted and a better supervision exercised, I do "not consider the Hamlet to be in a bad sanitary condition, as "the total number of houses reported by the Mansion House "Council is but 508 or about 5 per cent. of the houses occupied "either as lodging or tenement houses (10,000) and many of the "defects complained of are not of a serious character." The Vestry consider that the Report of Mr. Cubitt Nichols, completely exonerates them from the charges of serious dereliction of duty which had been so frequently made against them. The Vestry had for some time previous to the enquiry been considering how certain of the sanitary works in the Hamlet might be better carried out and had referred the subject to a Committee. Carrying out Sanitary Work. One of the evils existing is the inability of the Vestry to compel any receptacle for dust except an ashpit to be provided. The Vestry are advised that it is better in a sanitary point of view not to have ashpits but some moveable receptacle. They have accordingly issued circulars advising the use of galvanized iron pails. It will be observed that Mr. Cubitt Nichols concurs in this view. The Vestry have also determined that in certain of the poorer districts the dust shall be removed by men who are paid by the day, so that there shall not be any incentive lor them to neglect their work. 12 Assistant Inspector of Nuisances. The Vestry have also appointed an assistant inspector of nuisances so as to enable a more efficient supervision of the various works. Medical Officer of Health. For some considerable time Dr. Corner, the Medical Officer of Health, has suffered much from ill health, and the Vestry have felt bound to address communications to him, and on the 17th March, 1886, Dr. Corner sent in his resignation as Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst, and the same was accepted. It has been referred to the sanitary committee to consider as to the duties and emoluments of the office and to bring up their report thereon along with that on the reference as to the sanitary requirements of the Hamlet. Superannuation of Dr. Corner. It has also been referred to them to consider and report upon the amount of Superannuation which shall be awarded to Dr. Corner, after his lengthy services. Acting Medical Officer. Dr. Arthur Caesar, has been appointed Acting Medical Officer pending the consideration of the matter. Sewer Ventilators. The Apparatus patented by Mr. J. M. Knight, the Vestry's Surveyor, for disinfecting the vapours arising from sewer ventilators, has continued to work satisfactorily, and several of them have been fixed in the Hamlet. Conferences. As has been before stated, the Vestry have from time to time appointed delegates to confer with delegates from other Boards, on subjects of more than mere local interest. This course enabled an interchange of views and the result has been of great advantage in securing concerted aCtion. The following statement gives the name of the Board convening the conference, the subjeCt matter of consideration, and the names of the delegates appointed by the Vestry to attend:— Board convening Conference. Subject Matter. Names of Delegates appointed by by Vestry. St. George, Hanover Square Condition of the Thames Messrs. J. D. Kemp, A. E. Wood, & F. J. Wood, with Mr. J. M. Knight, the Surveyor. St. James, Westminster London School Board Messrs, H. Cushen, 0. W. Peacock & G. Coker. St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington Use of Steam Rollers Messrs. A. Furness, J. Ginn and J. M. Knight, Surveyor St. Mary, Newington Obstructions by costermongers, and duties of police with respect thereto Messrs. B. Cundick, J. Ginn, A. Furness, W. Parfett and J. Loftus. St. Pancras Municipal Government of London Messrs. A. Furness, H. Cushen and J. D. Kemp. Westminster Ditto Messrs. A. Furness, H. Cushen, F. J. Wood and J. D. Kemp. 13 The Expense of the annual election of Vestrymen and Auditors, in 1885, was £25 17s. 0d. Financial. Expenses of Election of Vestrymen. The precept of the Returning Officer for the proportion payable by this Hamlet, of the expenses of the election of the School Board for London, in November 1885, amounted to £121 17s. 1d. Expenses of School Board Election. The Vestry agreed with other parishes that the expenses were very great, and that there ought to be some detailed statement given of how the expenses were made up. Communications have been addressed to the Education Department, asking for the details, but up to the present they are declined to be given. The grant on account of disturnpiked roads has again been received. Disturnpiked Road. The poor rate shows a slight reduction having been 2s. 11d. in the £ as against 3s. 1d. last year. Poor Rate. The Vestry's Calls for General, Lighting and Sewers Rates has been as follows:— For General Rate, equal to 2s. 1½d. in the £. Lighting „ „ 3d. „ Sewers „ „ 1d. „ As has been frequently before pointed out, the School Board Precept has to be paid out of the General Rate, and so also has a part of the precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The School Board precept represents a rate equal to 9½d. in the £ And the portion of the Metropolitan Board precept represents a rate of rather more than ½d. „ Making in all 10d. „ so that the amount of the General Rate would be 1s. 3½d. in the £, and the total rates of the Vestry for its own purposes is. 7½d. in the £. General, Lighting, and Sewers' Rates. This is the same as the expenditure of the previous year, and compares favourably with former years, as appears by the following Table:— 1875 The Amount required by the Vestry for its own purposes was equal to in £. 1s. 8d. 1876 ditto ditto 1s. 8d. 1877 ditto ditto 1s. 8d. 1878 ditto ditto 1s. 8½d. 1879 ditto ditto 1s. 8½d. 1880 ditto ditto 1s. 9½d. 1881 ditto ditto 1s. 8d. 1882 ditto ditto 1s. 7½d. 1883 ditto ditto 1s. 5½d. 1884 ditto ditto 1s. 8d. 1885 ditto ditto 1s. 7½d. 1886 ditto ditto 1s. 7½d. 14 School Board. The Vestry hope that the newly constituted School Board for London will exercise a greater economy than its predecessors did. A Statement of the various School Board Precepts are appended as usual. The Precept for 1886-7, has not yet been received. Metropolitan Board Precepts. A Statement of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, are appended. The Precept for the year 1886-7, has not yet been received. Loans. The Vestry has contracted two Loans during the year, both of the amounts having been advanced by the Metropolitan Board of Works, viz.:—£6,500 at £3½ per cent., for the expenses of Paving Works in Devonshire-street, and White Horse-lane, and £1,000 at £3½ per cent. for purchase of Land at Edmonton. Assessment Committee Appeals. Connected with finance may properly be stated that the Vestry have given their sanction to the Assessment Committee to appear as Respondents in three appeals against the Valuation List, which have been lodged by (1) Messrs. Hollington; (2) The East London Water Works Company; (3) The East London Railway Company. The appeal of the Water Works Company is by far the most important as, if their contention be correct, their assessment will be reduced by over half their present one. Contracts A list of the formal contracts sealed during the year will be found set out at the end of the audited accounts. Annual Accounts.

REPORT AND ACCOUNTS of the SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 25TH, 1886. LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY & HULL, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, E. 1886, REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I beg again to lay before you a summary of the various works executed under the direction of my department during the year, and must once more express a regret that they are not of greater extent and importance, the funds at your disposal for paving being insufficient for the repairs necessitated by the ordinary traffic of the district, but I trust that during the coming year such financial arrangements may be made as will permit considerable work to be undertaken. The following Table shews the quantity of work done, the cost of which was ^"647 19s. 5d. for labor, and £800 8s. 3d. for material. New Paving, squared and laid 10,394 ft. sup. Old do. taken up and relaid 37,309 „ „ Ditto, redressed and relaid 658 „ „ New Pitching laid 246 yds. „ Old Pitching relaid 2,573 „ „ New Curb laid 267 ft. run. Old Curb relaid 5,531 „ „ Ditto, redressed and relaid 535 „ „ Old Channel relaid 4,228 „ „ New Tees Scoriæ Brick Channel laid 5,778 „ „ ROAD REPAIRS. The following table will shew the quantity of material used on the various roads; this tabular statement will I think be deemed satisfactory, as shewing that the cost has not much increased beyond that of last year ; it is much below the year 1884.

The Vestry have lost by death three horses and purchased three additional ones during the year. STEAM ROLLER. During the year the Roller has been worked 186 days on the Vestry's roads, the cost of which, if hired, would have been £418 10 0 The Vestry have received for hire of Roller 85 8 3 Cost of working:—Wages £l20 18 3 Fuel 38 18 6 503 18 3 Repairs and Wheels 87 10 3 Fares, Oil, &c. 6 5 2 253 12 2 Result of the year's work £250 6 1 76 LIGHTING. The Public lamps, 920 in number, have been supplied, lighted, painted and cleaned by the Commercial Gas Co., at a cost of £3,536 19s. 11d. No complaint has arisen during the year of want of pressure, or quality of the gas. SEWERS. The cost of labor for cleansing Sewers and Gullies, and other matters chargeable to Sewers has been £649 8s. 4d. The amount paid for water for Hushing sewers was £169 4s. od. Small works of construction and repairs to Sewers including cleansing and relaying pipe sewers, necessitated an expenditure of £440 5s. 5d., including 10 New Gullies and 8 Deodorising Chambers to Sewer Ventilators. The Deodorisers made upon the plan I patented last year continue to work satisfactorily, the annual cost not exceeding 1/6 each. I trust the day may not be far distant when all the sewer ventilators of the District will be fitted with this cheap but effective mode of obviating what has hitherto been an offensive and dangerous nuisance. During the year, 70 houses have been connected with the sewers of the Hamlet. The quantity of material removed from the Sewers, was 261 yards and that from Gullies 480 yards cube. THE UNEMPLOYED. In order to provide employment for the numerous hands out of work during the winter you ordered a serviceable (though not absolutely necessary) alteration in the formation of the roadway of Nottingham Place. The road was one made at the end of the last century and was constructed with one channel in the centre. The work done was to raise the centre and form a channel on either side. Owing to the numerous vaults, some of which extend to the centre of the road, the work was equal to making an entirely new road. I have every reason to speak well of the men who received casual employment during the trying period we have passed through, and an inspection of the place will at once convince everyone oi the quality and utility of the work done. Between thirty and forty extra men were employed during the period of distress at a cost of £450, the work done in addition to that above described being the removal of snow and street refuse. In conclusion, I desire to thank the members of the various Committees for assistance they have rendered me and permit me to remain Your obedient Servant, JNO. M. KNIGHT.

MUSTO, GEORGE WEDLAKE, VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. ANNUAL REPORT upon the PUBLIC HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1885—86, BY THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: Printed by Penny and Hull. Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1886. REPORT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen. In accordance with your request I have the honor to forward you the usual Annual Report of the Hamlet, for the year ending March 25th, 1886. The difficulties which naturally present themselves in dealing with the Sanitary Work of a period, not under my cognisance have been greatly increased by the information not being forthcoming from which the usual statistical particulars are obtained. The mortality from all causes was 2,232, this included all people that have died in the district, and also the proportion of those that have died in Hospitals and Public Institutions outside the district that were admitted into such Institution from Mile End previous to their death. Taking the population at 111,607, 2,232 deaths give an Annual Death-rate of 19.9 per 1,000. The number of births was 4,010 giving a birth-rate of 35.9 per 1,000. The mortality from zymotic diseases was 417 showing a death-rate from these diseases at 3.7 per 1,000. 137 of the deaths were due to Whooping Cough and 106 from Measles, this is accounted for to a great extent from the trivial manner parents treat these complaints, in fact, the majority of them never seeking medical advice until some serious complication has taken place. The number of deaths that have occurred under 1 year of age was 563, and those over 60 years of age 529, so that the mortality of young people and adult life have been comparatively small. No epidemics of a serious character have occurred during the year The most noteworthy event of the year was the enquiry instituted by the Mansion House Committee, and as this already has been made the subject of a special report by the Sanitary Committee, I think I need not allude further to this matter. Tables No. 1 and 2, will sufficiently explain themselves. Appended is the Sanitary Inspector s Report from which it will be seen, much very useful work has been carried out in that department. In my next report, which will really be my first annual one, as your Health Officer, I hope to deal at length with the whole sanitary work of the District.I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. 92 SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR 1885-6.
