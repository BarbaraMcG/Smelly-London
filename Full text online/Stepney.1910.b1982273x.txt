STE 11 ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1910. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST. FOR THE YEAR 1910. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you my tenth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1910. Population. The resident population of the Borough of Stepney estimated to the middle of the year was 316,269; distributed as follows:— Limehouse District 59,464 St. George-in-the-East 54,071 Mile End Old Town 120,717 Whitechapel District 82,017 316,269 There is reason to believe that these figures are somewhat higher than the actual population at the present time. The further we are removed in time from the preceding census, the more inexact our estimated population becomes, and the less reliable are all vital statistics. For statistical and comparative purposes, it is almost impossible to depart from the method adopted by the Registrar-General in order to arrive at a correct estimate of the population. This method is based on the assumption, that the rate of increase which prevailed in the last completed intercensal period has been maintained since the census was made. The results obtained by this method are not correct, as is demonstrated when the following census is taken. In 1901, most of the houses in the Borough were occupied. In 1910, there were 2,529 unoccupied houses in the Borough. In 1901 and previous years, small houses were demolished and large model dwellings were erected on the sites, which was not the case in 1910, and the three or 'our years immediately preceding it. 2 Overcrowding was prevalent in 1901, and it was most difficult to abate it due to the dearth of empty houses. It was almost impossible to have a house without paying a premium which was called "key money." In 1904, the number of empty houses became abnormal, and the number was on the increase until 1908, as is seen by the following figures which the Borough Treasurer has supplied me with— In the quarter ended March 31st, 1904, the number was 1,073. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1906, the number was 1,670. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1907, the number was 2,865. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1908, the number was 2,944. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1909, the number was 2,729. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1910, the number was 2,529. Rents have been reduced with the result that families, which in 1901 could not afford to rent two rooms, are now able to rent three or more at the same price. This method of estimating the population, however, has advantages over others which are sometimes employed. One method is based upon the extent of the excess of the number of births over the number of deaths in any particular year. The excess of births over deaths is known as the natural increase " in the population, but the accuracy of this method obviously rests upon the absence of any marked difference between the immigration and emigration associated with the district concerned. In the Borough of Stepney, emigration and immigration profoundly affect the population, and any estimate based upon the natural increase of the population would be almost worthless. It will be thus understood that, after a certain period since the census was taken, all methods of estimating the population are liable to error. On the whole, the method adopted by the Registrar-General is the most reliable for this district, but if an allowance is made for unoccupied houses, it is probably about 23,000 less. This will have the effect of making the birth-rate and death-rate slightly higher than that recorded in this report. Births. The total number of births registered during the year was 9,167, or 335 less than in the preceding year. They consisted of 4,561 males and 4,606 females. 1,801 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 30.2 per 1,000 of the population. 1,861 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 34.4 per 1,000 of the population. 3 3,553 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 29.4 per 1,000 of the population. 1,952 belonged to the White chapel District, or at the rate of 23.5 per 1000 of the population. The birth-rate throughout the whole Borough was 28.9 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was 23.6 per 1,000. The birth-rate is lower than in the preceding year, which was the lowest on record. It has been gradually declining year by year—with one or two exceptions—since 1896. The birth-rate of St. George's is slightly higher than in the preceding fear, but in the three other districts it is lower. 575 births occurred in the Mothers' Lying-in Home, Commercial Road:— 97 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 140 belonged to the Lime house District. 58 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 23 belonged to the White chapel District. 247 belonged to outlying districts. 300 births occurred in the London Hospital:— 67 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 39 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 23 belonged to the Lime house District. 24 belonged to the White chapel District. 147 belonged to outlying districts. 53 births occurred in St. George's Infirmary:— 50 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 1 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 2 belonged to the Lime house District. 52 births occurred in the Mile End Infirmary:— 51 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 1 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 103 births occurred in the White chapel Infirmary:— 80 belonged to the White chapel District. 7 belonged to Mile End Old Town. 2 belonged to the Lime house District. 1 belonged to St. George-in-the-East. 13 belonged to outlying districts. 4 26 births occurred in Poplar belonging to this Borough.

Two other families who had been in contact with the patient were taken to the shipping agent's receiving house in Crellin Street. One family consisted of eleven people and the other of nine people. These twenty-three people (which included three from 64, Whitechapel Road) were taken to the Council's Shelter and were kept under supervision during the incubation period.

To the Chairman and Members oj the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions at the last meeting of the Public Health Committee, I beg to submit my report on the Sanatorium treatment of Consumptives. In attempting to answer the question whether the sanatorium treatment of consumptives has justified the expectations of its earlier advocates, we must not confuse the expectations of the expert with those of the " man in the street.'' Some members of the public already hint that popular expectation has not been realised ; but to expect the impossible is to ensure disappointment. It is always well to set a high standard, and to refuse to be satisfied until this is attained ; but the standard must not be an impossible ideal. Nevertheless, we should be satisfied with nothing short of what has been shown to be possible under the most favourable conditions. What may reasonably be expected from sanatorium treatment of consumption. Every case in whatever stage of the disease cannot be cured in three months, though this is, probably, what the public has come to believe, was anticipated. Some cases in the earliest stages may become cured in less than three months. Many early cases can be put well on the way to complete recovery in three months, and even more advanced cases may in this time be started in a direction which will lead to recovery if persistently followed for some months after leaving the sanatorium. Unfortunately, few cases enter the sanatorium whilst their disease is in such an early stage, that cure is to be anticipated in three months. Of the early cases who enter the sanatorium in such a condition that cure may be expected, if treatment is persisted in, some are unable to remain for the required time, due to pecuniary reasons. These reasons must be taken into consideration if complete success is to be hoped for in the future. The patient perhaps, is obliged to return to work, in crder to suppoit his family. Unless he returns to work, possibly his place will be filled, and his prospects ruined. In such cases, much, if not all the good which was derived from the treatment, may be lost. It is just as well that we should realise that the " three months' cure " is only possible in the earliest cases. It requires great patience from the consumptive if he is to get well. He may get worse rapidly, he can only get well slowly. The patient who is encouraged to believe that if he goes to a sanatorium for a few weeks he will get well, is discouraged, if at the end of the stated time he is still uncured. 20 Apart from the question of cost, we must also consider the fact that the moral condition of the patient may degenerate as an effect of prolonged idleness. As will be seen later, in some sanatoria, -this difficulty is overcome partially by providing occupation for the patients. As far as possible, this occupation should be of an outdoor nature. In this district, a large number of consumptives consists of tailors. It will be readily seen how injurious it would be for the patient, and how useless the sanatorium treatment would be, if the consumptive returned to his trade and former surroundings. The probable cause of his illness, is the posture in which he works, and the inhalation of the foul atmosphere during long hours every day in a crowded workroom. A return to his former occupation under these circumstances, would soon be followed by a break down in his health. Speaking generally, in spite of the comparatively large percentage of " cures," the results of sanatorium treatment cannot be considered entirely satisfactory, in that comparatively few consumptives are able to obtain admission to a sanatorium, and so large a proportion of those who are admitted, must return to conditions and surroundings unfavourable to their continuing well. So far as they go, the figures given below are, on the whole, fairly satisfactory. They show that sanatorium treatment can do much, as a large proportion of cases leave the institution well on the road towards recovery. Though the condition of the patient when he leaves the sanatorium is encouraging, it is necessary to enquire afterwards to ascertain whether the improvement is maintained. If the improvement does not withstand the strain of work, we are not justified in speaking of a " cure." I have made enquiries as to the results in some of the sanatoria, where it is possible for this Council to make arrangements to retain beds at reasonable costs, and in which endeavours are made to keep in touch with its former inmates. Many remain in good health, others relapse. The latter may cause a feeling of disappointment, but I do not think they are discouraging. I have no doubt that some who are classed as only " improved," return to full work, and remain well. The disappointment which sometimes results from sanatorium treatment is due in great measure to the fact that so few patients apply for treatment in the early stage. This is in some degree owing to the difficulty of diagnosis in the initial stage of the disease, but in very much greater measure to the failure of the person to seek relief. When the means of living depend upon continuance of work, a man will not give in for apparently trifling ill-health. If others are dependent upon the earnings of the individual, there is even greater reason to continue work as long as the strength allows. Thus, the working man does not always seek relief in the early stage of consumption, nor does the woman who is employed in business. The house-wife- 21 though working equally hard, can more easily take a few hours to go to the out patients' department of a hospital, as she has not to obtain an employer's leave to absent herself from work. She may be under the impression that she is suffering from weakness, indigestion, or other slight ailment, but, the true nature of the illness is often detected at the hospital, and thus is explained probably the reason, that a greater proportion of women than of men enter the sanatorium in an early stage of the disease. Early cases may be detected sooner if the " Tuberculosis Dispensary," system becomes more in vogue. Such a dispensary has been in existence for 21 years in Edinburgh, and one has been established in Paddington for the last 18 months or 2 years. Another one is shortly to be started in the Borough of Stepney. It is claimed that this system offers the best method of dealing with the consumption problem by the provision of:— (1) Effective curative treatment. (2) Effective method of prevention. (3) Effective machinery for dealing with the problem as a whole. The physician of a Tuberculosis Dispensary visits the patients in their own homes and by personal influence insures that his instructions are carried out, while at the same time he obtains first hand information as to the conditions of home and other environments which have produced the disease. These advantages in the prevention and early diagnosis of consumption are obvious. The doctor having thus become acquainted with members of the family, finds it easy to persuade them to submit to examination. Thus, a great number of early cases are discovered which may be arrested in good time. These " contact " cases would, in the absence of a system of home visitation, possibly remain undiscovered until too late. The domiciliary visit has often the further advantage of discovering an active focus of infection in the person of a chronic consumptive not under any medical treatment. I do not know of a better system by which early cases of consumption can be discovered. Having discovered early cases we have still two great difficulties, first—as I have already stated—the pecuniary one ; and secondly, the want of accommodation. The working-man may not have to pay for sanatorium treatment, but he may have to wait such a long time for a vacancy in the sanatorium where admission is gained by a subscriber's letter, that, when at length he is admitted, he is no longer an '' early case." The waiting period may be anything from three to four months, or even longer in such sanatoria. There is also the difficulty of making provision for those dependent upon the consumptive, while he is unable to work. 22 I have already referred to the danger of the consumptive going back to his family impoverished by his enforced idleness, and to the same unhygienic surroundings which he had left, on entering the sanatorium. One cannot wonder that his health does not continue to improve under these conditions. The statistics of a sanatorium show a most encouraging proportion of patients 'eaving the institution " improved " or " much improved," but people often measure the success of treatment by their personal observation of individual patients, after their discharge from the institution. We cannot expect them to be impressed with the success of the treatment, when they see the patient, who left the sanatorium nearly well, dying within a few months of his discharge. It is not the " treatment " which is at fault, but the conditions which render the proper treatment almost impossible. Maitland Sanatorium.—In all cases, patients are received for a month at firstAt the end of this time it is decided whether or not their stay should be extended. The average duration of treatment is three months, and it is assumed that every patient will be able to stay for this period, if the medical superintendent and the doctor who sends the patient, think it advisable. The Sanatorium system consists of a graduated scale of rest, exercise, and work, ordered for each individual according to his or her condition, with a constant accompaniment of pure bracing air, good food, and careful supervision. The system of graduated work has been proved to give such excellent results, that it is considered as essential a part of the treatment as fresh air or good food. According to their fitness, patients are graduated to various degrees of work, after a preliminary period of rest, when necessary. For men patients, the classes of work are as follows :— Class A.—Light domestic work, such as cleaning of silver, brass, lamps, basins, &c. ; tarring woodwork, painting, &c. Class B.—Light gardening ; window-cleaning ; small repairs ; wood-chopping. Class C.—Spade-work (light or heavy spades); wheeling barrows ; path-making ; trenching ; farm-work ; carpentering, &c. The hours of work, also; are graduated from one hour onwards ; in some cases, the full test of eight hours a day is reached. When a patient can stay a sufficient length of time to reach the full test of an ordinary working day, without rise of temperature, or any indication of undue fatigue, he can leave the Sanatorium with confidence in himself, and he can be recommended for employment with some feeling 23 of security. It has been found that the training in out-door work given in the Sanatorium, has enabled patients occupied previously in unsuitable work in factories or offices, to obtain out-door employment greatly to their own benefit. The women patients do needlework, house-work, gardening, Swedish drill, &c., in varying degrees. To establish an " economic cure " (i.e., one which renders the patient capable of recovering his place in the working world), it is often most desirable to provide an opportunity for a continuation of open-air work, after the period of actual Sanatorium treatment is completed. The conduct of the Sanatorium and the estate offers abundant scope for work of this kind, but a sum of 10s. to 15s. a week is required for the maintenance of the workers, who are still patients, and who share in all the advantages of the Sanatorium life as to supervision, food, &c. If break-downs occur, the " working patients " at once become ordinary patients until they are well again, and in this way many difficult cases have been tided over the critical time of returning to full work. This feature of the Sanatorium work is of the utmost value, and help is asked by the Sanatorium Committee, to further develop its opportunities and usefulness, by subscriptions to the " Working Patients' Maintenance Fund," to which, also, any profit on the working of the institution is transferred. The members of the " Working Patient's Staff " form a considerable number of regular officers of the Sanatorium, and these are paid according to their value to the institution, as well as receiving residence, board, laundry and medical supervision. Only patients who have passed through the Sanatorium in the ordinary way are taken on as workers. Torquay Sanatorium.—Ninety patients were admitted during the year July, 1908-1909, of whom 49 were males and 41 females. Of this number, the disease was arrested in 33 cases ; 22 were very much improved ; 16 much improved; 12 improved ; and 7 were stationary. There were no deaths. The number of cases in which the disease was arrested exceeds that of any previous year. This is attributed to the greater care which has been exercised in the selection of cases sent for treatment. Nearly all of those who are classed as " very much improved " have been enabled to return to their former occupation provided that it was of a suitable nature ; and the same may be said, to a less extent, of those classed as "much improved;'» while of those classed as " improved," some returned to their own houses, and others to similar institutions for " open-air treatment." 24 Benenden Sanatorium, Kent.—During the year 1909, 226 patients left the Sanatorium in the following condition :— Arrested 94 or 41.7 per cent. Improved 99 or 43.8 per cent. Unimproved 32 or 14.1 per cent. Died 1 or .4 per cent. 226 Patients are admitted in various stages of the disease, and are classified as follows :— Class 1.—One lobe of the lung affected. Early tuberculosis. Class 2.—Two lobes affected. Moderately advanced. Class 3.—Three or more lobes affected. Advanced. The following table gives the results obtained in each class :— Class 1 Class 2. Class 3. Arrested 64 or 72 per cent. 24 39 per cent. 6 or 8 per cent. Improved 23 or 26 31 51 ,, 45 or 59 ,, Unimproved 2 or 2 „ 6 10 ,, 24 or 31.5 ,, Died — - 1 or 1.5 ,, 89 61 70 As is always the case, the results obtained are far better when the disease is in an early stage than when it is advanced, and the urgent need for early diagnosis and treatment is thus demonstrated. If we exclude the patients in the third class, it will be found that 95 per cent, of the patients improve more or less during their stay. The length of stay of the patients is again longer than that obtained at most sanatoria for the working classes, as the average is 13 weeks G days, and, excluding those patients discharged at the end of a month as unsuitable, the average is 15 weeks. The average gain in weight was 10 lbs. 12 oz., being 4 oz. more then the previous year. In Class 1, the average gain was 12 lb. 11 oz. In Class 2, the average gain was 12 lb. 1 oz. In Class 3, the average gain was 7 lb. 8 oz. 25 Each patient, on the average, gained 12 oz. a week during his stay, an increase of 1 oz. on the previous year's average, which is attributed to the altered diet which has therefore been satisfactory. An attempt is made to keep in touch with as many patients as possible, by writing to them at regular intervals, and in this way some very important and interesting results have been obtained. It is only by ascertaining how many of the patients keep in good health after leaving the Sanatorium, that the efficacy of the treatment can be proved. All patients are written to six months after they leave, again at the end of twelve months after leaving, and afterwards at intervals of twelve months. 98 patients left the Sanatorium more than six months, and less than twelve months ago, and of these 83 have been traced. 38 of these are doing full work. 4 of these are doing partial work. 21 of these are doing no work. 13 of these are dead. 7 have been re-admitted. 156 patients left the Sanatorium more than twelve months, and less than two years ago, and of these 119 have been traced. 53 of these are doing full work. 7 of these are doing partial work. 12 of these are doing no work. 37 of these are dead. 10 have been re-admitted. 54 patients left the Sanatorium more than two years ago, and 42 of them have been traced. 19 of these are doing full work. 2 of these are doing partial work. 6 of these are doing no work. 15 of these are dead. Doubt has at times been cast upon the permanence of the cure, even in those who leave sanatoria with the disease arrested. The following tables give the after results, classified according to the condition of the patient on discharge. 26 Patients who left more than six months and less than twelve months ago :— Conditions on discharge. Full work. Partial work. No work Dead. Total. Arrested 26 1 3 — 30 Improved 12 2 14 5 33 Unimproved 1 1 4 8 14 24 have not been traced or have been re-admitted.

Of the patients who have left the Sanatorium with the disease arrested 81.4 per cent, are still doing full work. Some of those who are not doing any work are in good health, but are out of employment for other reasons. King Edward VII. Sanatorium, Midhurst.—Information has been obtained as to the condition of 377 (92.8 per cent.) of the 406 patients who were discharged during the years July, 1906-1907 and [ulv, 1907-1908. GROUP 1.

Whereas in the following groups of more advanced cases, of 63 patients classified under Group 2, 45 or 71 per cent., and of 40 patients in Group 3, 14 or 35 per cent, were well or alive at the end of 1909.

It is of interest to note that indoor work, such as that of a clerk or a teacher, has proved quite compatible with continued good health. Very few patients return to an outdoor occupation ; but those whose work allows of them being out of doors for a considerable portion of the day, such as for instance, clergymen, surveyors, and medical men in the country, have almost invariably done well. Remunerative work, which allows of a former patient living for the most part in the open air, has proved very difficult to obtain. Lack of the capital necessary to re-commence life as a farmer, poultry keeper, fruit or vegetable grower, &c., is the chief obstacle to patients going back to the land. A few patients only have emigrated, and they for the most part have done well. Amongst these the following may be quoted :—A former clerk wrote to the Medical Superintendent from British 28 Columbia that his health is excellent. He has been ploughing, hoeing and gardening for twelve hours a day, and has found it rather a strain. He is now driving a milk waggon fourteen miles a day into the town. Another patient, formerly a lecturer in the City, also wrote from British Columbia. He "is not following any special treatment, but lives almost entirely out of doors, and sleeps in a tent for ten months of the year. He is training as a farmer." A former theological student, who emigrated to South Africa in 1907, reports that his health is good, and that he is teaching school subjects and carpentering at a mission station in Basutoland. A lady patient, contemporary with the last-mentioned at the Sanatorium, also emigrated to South Africa. She obtained a good appointment in a school in the Orange River Colony, and is at present employed, and enjoying good health. Several patients have obtained work in Buenos Aires, some as agents for London business houses, and two as surveyors. The reports received from all these patients are satisfactory. From the reports received from these patients, the capacity to adapt himself to the peculiar social and economic conditions of a new country is, apart from the question of health, about the most important asset which an emigrant can possess. A practical knowledge of some trade, or in the case of patients going out to farms, or ranches, a practical acquaintance with the everyday work on a general farm, is also most desirable, if not essential, for success. At the Victoria Hospital for Consumption in Edinburgh—which was one of the first to institute the open-air treatment—of 782 patients received since 1887,25 per cent. were, to all appearances, cured, while 50 per cent. were ameliorated to a certain extent. Dr. Burton-Fanning, Physician to the Kelling Open-air Sanatorium states, that without the exercise of strict selection of cases for treatment, about one quarter recovered their health sufficiently to return to work. Another quarter are not strikingly or materially improved. The remaining one-half are distinctly benefited, but are unable to lead ordinary lives. When only favourable or strictly selected cases are dealt with, it may be claimed that about three-quarters of them are restored to fitness for work. It will be seen then how strikingly results are affected by the selection of cases for the treatment. Success may be said chiefly to depend upon submitting the patients to treatment while their disease is in its early or tractable stage. 29 Consulting continental statistics, Dr. Rumpf of Freidrichsheim states that of 541 cases treated, 75.6 per cent. of those whose malady was in the first stage were discharged able to work. Durability of Results —For the purpose of inquiring as to the durability of the results obtained by sanatorium treatment, the statistics of German Sanatoria are more reliable, as they are not of such recent origin as English institutions. Dettweiler's important report states, that out of 1,022 cases of confirmed consumption treated during a space of 10 years at Falkenstein, 132 patients were discharged as absolutely cured. After a period of from 3 to 9 years, he wrote to 99 of the 132 cases, and received replies from 98 of them. Dettweiler learnt that 11 patients had died of affections which were not tubercular; 12 had suffered from recrudescence of their consumption, and had again recovered completely; 3 were still ill with consumption; the remaining 72 patients maintained their recoveries. That is to say, 72.5 per cent. of the patients discharged cured, retained their satisfactory positions after the lapse of from 3 to 9 years. The results by Dr. Rumpf of Freidrichsheim are almost identical, but refer to a period of only two or three years subsequently to the discharge of the patients. Of those received in the first stage of their malady 75.6 per cent. were still able to work. Of the 143 patients treated at the Mudesley Sanatorium during the last 5 years, 47 or 32.86 per cent. of the whole number were considered fit for work at the end of their course. In to 5 years after their discharge:— 36 or 76.6 per cent. maintained their satisfactory condition. 3 or 6.39 per cent. relapsed. 6 or 12.76 per cent. there were no history. 2 or 4.25 per cent. died. Of the last number, one died from appendicitis and the other from pneumonia. At the Kelling Sanatorium which has been open for 6 years, it is stated that when the cases are taken in hand at an early stage of the disease, over 60 per cent. make recoveries which allow them to keep at work for at least 5 years. Educational effect of the Treatment.—In connection with this subject, we must not forget that the mission of the Sanatorium is not only to afford all the possible alleviation to the patient, while he is an inmate, but it also fulfils the important function of educating the patient. He obtains information as to the best way of keeping his disease in check, and he also learns how to minimise the danger of infection for his fellows, and is able to apply these principles in his own home afterwards. 30 He learns by personal experience what is of real value, and what should be avoided. He has the encouragement of seeing, amongst his companions, the various stages of benefit which are obtained under suitable conditions. The after-history returns show very well the high educational value of a stay in a sanatorium, and to what extent patients continue to live on the lines, which they have been taught. In only very few instances have patients recorded that they have ceased to practice any part of the sanatorium treatment. Almost invariably, the former patient states that he, or she, is following out the treatment, as far as possible. Open windows at night and all day when practicable, regular, and in many cases, better meals, regular exercise, and a more carefully regulated life generally; outdoor pursuits, such as gardening and walking being substituted for less healthy recreation, are features of sanatorium life which are commonly mentioned as being still observed. The object of submitting this report is to supply the Committee with sufficient information as to the advantage of Sanatorium treatment, and whether the Committee would be justified in recommending the Council to incur the necessary expense of retaining beds at a Sanatorium. The number of beds for the use of residents suggested to be retained at a Sanatorium or Sanatoria is 10. Is this number sufficient and what will be the expense to the ratepayers? As stated in a previous report, the number of deaths of consumption in the Borough of Stepney in 1909 was 521, or one-twelfth of the total number of deaths in the Metropolis. This is an increase of 31 over the number in 1908, although I have no doubt that the actual population is less. There are no means of giving the number of persons suffering from consumption in the Borough, but it is usual to obtain it approximately by multiplying the number of deaths with a certain factor. By doing this, it is estimated that 2,500 residents are suffering from consumption. About 800 of these are probably dealt with by Poor Law Authorities, leaving a balance of 1,700. At least 600 are probably in the incipient stage, and having regard to the facts mentioned above, as well as to the views of the principal Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, it is suggested, that an attempt should be made to deal with this class of patients. To deal comprehensively with them, 200 beds would probably be needed. The expense of maintaining such a number, is, of course, prohibitive. The only Metropolitan Boroughs which have adopted the plan of paying for beds at Sanatoria are:— Woolwich with 7 beds, Southwark with 6, Westminster with 4 and Bethnal Green with 6 beds. Woolwich Borough Council pays 28s. per week for each bed at the Maitland Sanatorium, when the bed is occupied, and 20s. a week when the bed in not occupied. The Boroughs of Westminster, Reading and Northampton are also maintaining beds at this Sanatorium. Southwark Borough Council pay £78 per annum per bed at the Benenden Sanatorium. 31 Bethnal Green Council pay £50 per annum at the Fairlight Sanatorium, Hasting but male patients only are admitted. It will therefore be seen that 10 beds will cost from £500 to £800 a year. I suggest that if this scheme is adopted, only the very early cases should be admitted, and the statistics then, probably, will prove of a more satisfactory nature, than those given above. The number of applicants for admission, will always be greatly in excess of the avilable accommodation, and it is obviously the best plan to make use of the beds for such cases only, which promise to be lastingly restored to capable health. There are two ways by which the Public Health Committee may become cognisant of these early cases. I have already suggested one, and the other method is by making the notification of Phthisis compulsory. As I have frequently stated, my opinion is that voluntary notification is comparatively futile. In 22 Metropolitan districts, the system has been adopted. Its weakness is apparent and admitted, but it is thought by these authorities that imperfect notification is better than no notification at all. Probably not more than 10 per cent. and certainly less than 15 per cent. of the cases are notified. These cases are invariably advanced cases, and quite unfit for sanatorium treatment. To sum up, I think we may reasonably expect that of the cases of consumption which are recognised sufficiently early, and commence sanatorium treatment, a large number may be cured and return to work in three months. I do not advocate that the sanatorium treatment should be at the expense of, and exclude the present administrative action in any way. Housing accommodation should be continually improved ; the conditions under which the patient lives should be considered ; the issue of printed general instructions as to the prevention of the spread of the disease and suggestions as to personal hygiene should be continued as well as occasional or periodical disinfection of premises, and on removal or death of the patient. Educating the general public by means of lectures on the prevention of consumption should also be encouraged. In conclusion, I must express my obligation to the Sanatorium Authorities for their annual reports, where I have gained statistical and other facts, especially those from Benenden, Maitland, Ventnor, Bournemouth, Torquay and Midhurst, as well as to Dr. Burton-Fanning, Physician to the Kelling Open-air Sanatorium and Dr. Squire, Physician to the Mount Vernon Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Hampstead and Northwood. D. L. THOMAS, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, 43, White Horse Street, Commercial Road, E. 24th October, 1910. 32 The Report was submitted to the Finance Committee, which submitted the following Report to the Council:— We have had under consideration the following reference from the Public Health Committee upon a proposal that, under the powers contained in Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Council should, as an experiment, defray for a period of one year the cost of maintaining 10 beds in a sanatorium, or sanatoria, viz.:— Provision of Sanatorium Treatment for Consumptives. At the Meeting of the Council, held on the 15th June, 1910, we submitted the following Resolutions which were passed at the Conference of Representatives of the Corporation of the City of London and Metropolitan and City Borough Councils, viz. :— 1. That this Conference is of opinion that the provision of sanatoria for the educational and curative treatment of cases of tuberculosis is advisable. 2. (a) That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that a sanatorium should be established for the accommodation of persons of the working classes of the Metropolis suffering from tuberculosis, and that such institution should be maintained by a charge upon the several Metropolitan Boroughs in accordance with their respective rateable values. (b) That in the opinion of this Conference the proposed sanatorium should be under the direct control of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and that such authority be asked to seek the necessary Parliamentary powers for that purpose, if necessary. (c) That copies of the above Resolutions be forwarded to the Metropolitan Asylums Board and to the Local Government Board. 3. That pending the provision of a sanatorium for the working classes it is desirable that each Municipal Authority should secure beds in some existing sanatorium according to the provisions of Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 4. That in the opinion of this Conference the establishment of tuberculosis dispensaries in each of the Metropolitan Boroughs would be a desirable adjunct in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. 33 In submitting the above Resolutions to the Council, we pointed on that we were approaching the Metropolitan Asylums Board with a view to the use of their vacant Isolation Hospitals as sanatoria for consumptive patients and that we were also considering the question of taking action in the direction indicated in Resolution 3. The Council, upon our recommendation, expressed its agreement with the terms of the above Resolutions. We then approached the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but found that they had decided to use their vacant Isolation Hospitals for other purposes, and the matter dropped. Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is as follows:— 75. (1) Any sanitary authority may provide for the use of the inhabitants of their district hospitals, temporary or permanent, and for that purpose may— (a) Themselves build such hospitals, or (b) Contract for the use of any hospital or part of a hospital, or (c) Enter into any agreement with any person having the ment of any hospital for the reception of the sick inhabitants of their district on payment of such annual or other sum as may be agreed on. (2) Two or more sanitary authorities may combine in providing a common hospital. We have for some considerable time past had the question of the provision of sanatoria treatment for consumptives under consideration, and upon our instructions the Medical Officer of Health prepared a report upon the matter, It will be observed in the report that the Medical Officer of Health estimates that the cost of maintaining 10 beds in a sanatorium, or sanatoria, will be from £500 to £800, and we are of opinion that the Council should, as an experiment maintain for a period of one year 10 beds in already established sanatoria, and we have instructed the Medical Officer of Health to make enquiries as to the exact terms upon which this scheme could be carried into effect. We therefore propose, subject to the approval of the Finance and Parliamentary Committee, to include in the next estimates the sum necessary to cover the expenditure to be incurred if the Council approves the proposal. We have authorised to be circulated to members, as a separate document, copy of a Report by the Medical Officer of Health upon the subject. c 34 The matter first came under our consideration when we were reviewing the estimates of expenditure and income for the year 1911-12 (inasmuch as the estimate of the Public Health Committee included a sum of £650 to cover the cost of the experiment for the year), but at that time we were not in a position fully to consider the financial aspect involved in the proposal, and we therefore amended the estimate of that Committee by transferring the amount to "Contingencies," increasing such item by an additional sum of £650, in order that when we had had an opportunity of further considering the matter we should be in a position, if satisfied with the financial aspect, to submit the necessary estimate to the Council. We deemed it necessary to proceed cautiously in the matter, having regard to the fact that the proposal of the Public Health Committee constitutes a quite new and additional feature of the Council's work, and notwithstanding that it was the intention of the Public Health Committee to try the treatment as an experiment' we felt that the Council, having once entered upon such an undertaking, it would be well nigh impossible for them, having regard to the nature of the disease and the lengthy treatment required in order to benefit most of its victims, to discontinue paying for the treatment, whilst in addition we felt the expenditure would eventually increase to such a sum as would inflict a heavy burden upon the ratepayers of the Borough. In this connexion, we considered as to whether treatment of such a disease as consumption was one which should be a charge upon the national exchequer or a central body, such, for instance, as the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or whether it should be borne by local sanitary authorities. If either the first or second course were adopted, the charge for such treatment would be more equitably borne, whilst if the last mentioned obtained, each sanitary authority would have to bear the whole of the charges for its particular area, and this would press more heavily upon some Boroughs than upon others. We may mention that we are advised there are some 2,500 cases of consumption in the Borough, and that we are therefore in sympathy with the object which the Public Health Committee have in view. At our meeting on the day of the date of this report we were favoured with the presence of the Chairman (Alderman Boustred) and Vice-Chairman (Councillor Evans) of the Public Health Committee, who very fully explained the views of that Committee to us. We gave the matter very lengthy consideration, and as the result, by a majority, we did not see our way to submit the necessary estimate to the Council as suggested by the Public Health Committee. Inasmuch as the proposal involves a crucial question of policy, we submit the matter to the Council for their decision. We may state that, in the event of the Council deciding that it is advisable to undertake the cost of maintenance of the sanatorium treatment of consumptives 35 as proposed, we should be prepared to submit the necessary estimate in that behalf, and the expenditure up to a sum of £650 can, as above indicated, be met out of the estimates for the ensuing year We recommend— That no action be taken in the matter. At the same Council meeting the Public Health Committee submitted the following Report, which was adopted:— We understand that the Finance and Parliamentary Committee are presenting a report to the Council upon our reference to them with regard to the provision of sanatorium treatment for consumptives. It will be observed from such reference that Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, gives the Council ample powers to adopt the course which we suggest, viz.:—To maintain a number of beds in existing sanatoria for the reception of consumptive patients selected from the inhabitants of the Borough. During the time this matter has been under our consideration we have had a number of pamphlets and reports presented to us, and the Medical Officer of Health, in a lengthy report has submitted statements showing the methods of treatment and the benefits derived by patients at sanatoria and giving other information on the subject. We think that the Council should make much more strenuous efforts to prevent the spread of consumption than they are at present doing, and, in our opinion, the provision of sanatorium treatment for inhabitants of the Borough is urgently required and the extension by the new regulations of the Local Government Board of the system of notifying cases of this disease (at present restricted to "Poor Law" cases) to cases treated at hospitals and dispensaries makes the desirability for such treatment even more apparent. We therefore propose that at a cost not exceeding £650 the Council should, as an experiment, maintain at existing sanatoria, a number of beds which should be occupied by persons finally selected by us under the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, and in this connection we would remind the Council that there is every prospect of a dispensary for the treatment of consumptives being established in this Borough as the result of the efforts which His Worship the Mayor is making in connection with the memorial to King Edward VII. and the patients could be selected from persons under treatment at the dispensary and thus render such an institution more valuable as a means of dealing with this disease, c 2 36 We should propose only to send patients to the sanatoria whom there is every prospect would be cured by the treatment, but it must be remembered that each consumptive person in the Borough is a source of infection to the healthy inhabitants and that even though a patient may not be cured by three months' residence in a sanatorium yet such patient is trained to habits which will minimise the risk of infection to other persons and to rules of life which may prevent the patient from becoming a burden upon his or her relatives or upon the rates for some years. We recommend— That, subject to the approval of the estimate by the Finance and Parliamentary Committee, the Council do authorise us as an experiment to maintain for a period of one year at a cost not exceeding £650 a number of beds in already established sanatoria for the treatment of consumptive inhabitants of the Borough, and that we be authorised to take the necessary steps to give effect to this Resolution. The Council, having adopted the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, it was resolved to leave the details of the scheme to that Committee. At the following meeting of the Public Health Committee it was decided to retain six beds for males at the Farlight Sanatorium, Hastings, and four beds for females at the Maitland Sanatorium. Infantile Mortality. 1,041 infants died under one year of age, which corresponds to a death-rate of 113 per 1,000 births. This number is 89 less than in the previous year and compares very favourably under all circumstances with that of London as a whole, which was 103 per 1,000 births. 247 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 137 per 1,000 births. 224 belonged to the St. Georges-in-the-East, or at the rate of 120 per 1,000 births. 355 belonged to the Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 100 per 1,000 births. 215 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 110 per 1,000 births. 37 Though the infantile mortality remains at a high figure, it shows a marked and continuous improvement, as is evident by the following table:— Limehouse District. St. George's. Mile End. Whitechapel District. The whole Borough. 1899 216 199 161 147 174 1900 227 141 166 140 166 1901 211 185 150 140 165 1902 197 160 163 117 155 1903 165 170 122 138 141 1904 208 161 145 143 158 1905 163 157 140 119 142 1906 168 141 126 123 136 1907 131 130 112 110 119 1908 171 141 117 108 130 1909 133 145 106 104 118 1910 137 120 100 110 . . 113 Deaths of Illegitimate Children. There were 61 deaths of illegitimate children under one year of age during the year, or at the rate of 326 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 12 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 375 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 15 belonged to St. Georges-in-the-East, or at the rate of 500 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 17 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 283 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 17 belonged to Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 261 per 1,000 illegitimate births. Report on the work of the Health Visitor. A Health Visitor was appointed and she started on her work on February 1st, 1910, in a portion of the Borough where the infantile mortality has been abnormally high. The average rate of mortality among infants under one year of age to 1,000 registered births in England and Wales was 138 in the ten years 1899-1908. In 1909, it was reduced to 109, which is the lowest rate for any year on record, and is to be ascribed possibly to favourable weather conditions. 38 In the portion of the Borough where the Health Visitor is devoting her time, the infantile mortality was 198 per 1,000 births in 1910. Excluding the deaths of infants who died immediately after birth and before the Health Visitor made her first visit, the infantile mortality was 170 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality figures for the years 1901-1910 for the area were as follows:— 1901 163 1902 126 1903 161 1904 212* 1905 145* 1906 178* 1907 142* 1908 190 1909 114 1910 198 * Miss Forrester was employed by a private individual to act as Health Visitor in the same area during the years 1904-1907 inclusive. The principal functions which the Health Visitor is called upon to perform are as follows:— (1) To advise expectant mothers on the management of their health, and as to the influence of ante-natal conditions on their infants. (2) To follow up the notification of births, and to visit the homes when the Doctor and Midwife have ceased to attend. (3) To note conditions of ignorant feeding or of non-supply of sufficient and nourishing food, and to take judicious steps to correct these evils. (4) To give advice on the proper feeding of infants; to warn mothers against premature weaning; to inculcate in particular the importance of breast feeding until the teeth appear; to see that foul or long-tubed feeding bottles, and "comforters" or dummy teats, are not used. When Miss Forrester was engaged in this area, she had great difficulty in preventing premature weaning. It is now quite the reverse. It is often found to be necessary to caution the mothers against prolonged suckling. In some instances it was found to be extended to two years, and 14 infants had not been weaned at the end of one year. 39 (5) To promote and encourage the practice of weighing infants regularly, and to instruct in, or remind mothers of, the simpler rules of hygiene in relation to the home and its inmates, and otherwise to assist in preventing the spread of such diseases as Measles, Whooping Cough, &c. It is curious what an objection some women have to weigh their babies. It is often their firm belief that if the baby is weighed, he will die before he is a year old. (6) To promote a knowledge of the value of fresh air, of keeping windows open at night, of cleanliness in the home, &c. (7) To note and report any insanitary or foul conditions in any of the homes visited. Remediable defects were found in 51 houses and were reported to the Sanitary Inspector besides a number of cases of overcrowding. (8) To visit and report on all cases in the Borough communicated by the Almoners of the London Hospital. (9) To keep a systematic record of all cases. Frequently during the course of her visits, the Health Visitor is asked to call and see women who are about to be confined. If the child is to survive and to be healthy, it goes without saying that the expectant mother should be in a healthy state. Many poor women are ill-fed or underfed, owing to no fault of theirs or their husbands. No one will deny that these women are just as much in need of free meals as ill-fed children attending elementary schools. The Stepney Invalid Kitchen has recently been established and supplies dinners to women after the child is born for one penny each on the recommendation of the Health Visitor. The diet for the invalid dinners is as follows (a) Beef tea, mutton or chicken broth. (b) Milk pudding or custard. (c) Boiled fish with sauce and potatoes. (d) Chicken with two vegetables. (e) Mutton or tripe, with Yorkshire pudding and two vegetables. The Health Visitor has found this institution of great benefit to poor women, but it is a pity that its benefits cannot be extended to those who are expecting to become mothers, and not only to those who have recently been confined. 40 The infant who survives, has been born, ordinarily, at or above full time, but a very large proportion of the infants who die early have been prematurely born. Premature birth is due to many causes which might be prevented, among others to the employment in factories, and otherwise, of women advanced in pregnancy. It is a frequent occurrence for the mother to work in a factory until the day before the child is born. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, was adopted in the Borough of Stepney in September, 1909. From this date until the end of December, 1909, 140 births were notified in the area specially selected for the Health Visitor. The parents of twenty of the infants had removed before the first visit was made was made by the Health Visitor, and nine of the infants had died. The remaining 111 infants were visited and kept under supervision until they attained one year of age. 94 of the infants were naturally fed, or 84.7 per cent. 6 of the infants were artificially fed, or 5.4 per cent. 11 of the infants were breast and bottle fed, or 9.4 per cent. 23 of the women were employed in factories and workshops, and 15 were engaged in tailoring, brushmaking, &c., as outworkers in their own homes. 43 infants were breast-fed entirely for three months, 35 were six months old before partial artificial feeding was resorted to. In 1910, 544 births were registered in the area visited by the Health Visitor. Of these 11 births occurred in Public Institutions outside the Borough, and were not visited. Of the remaining 533 births, 488 were notified under the Notification of Births Act, or 91.5 per cent. The notification certificates were sent by the Doctors or Midwives in attendance. A large number of the cases were attended by midwives from the Mothers' Lying-in-Home, Commercial Road. 30 births registered by the Registrar were said to be unknown at the address given. In several instances, incorrect addresses were probably given for the purpose of evading vaccination. 15 of the infants had died before the first visit was made, leaving 488 births where advice was given and particulars were obtained as to feeding, &c. 2,728 visits were made. Of these, 673 were first visits, 49 were visits in other parts of the Borough at the request of the Almoners of the London Hospital, and 2,006 were revisits. 41 130 of the mothers worked in factories, workshops. &c., and 80 were employed as outworkers in their own homes. 413 infants were brought up on the breast, or 84.7 per cent. 32 infants were artificially fed, or 6.5 per cent. 43 infants were partly brought up on the breast and partly artificially fed, or 8.8 per cent. Breast feeding was generally the case for the first three or four months, after which it was often found necessary to supplement the breast with an artificial food of some kind. Condensed milk was largely used for infants who were entirely artificially fed Inferior brands were often bought because of their cheapness, regardless of the fact that the milk was machine skimmed, and contained no fat, which is so essential to a baby. When the breast milk is deficient in quality or insufficient in quantity, and it becomes necessary to have it supplemented, cow's milk is rarely given for that purpose. It seems to be believed by a large number of women that the two kinds of milk will not agree with the baby. Flour, cornflour, and fine oatmeal are frequently given. One baby, 14 days old, was given two feeds daily of cornflour mixed with water, and another baby, 12 days old, was having fine oatmeal, on the advice of its grandmother, who insisted that the child cried so much because he was hungry. This was the young mother's first baby, and she had taken her own mother's advice, as she was quite ignorant of infant feeding. Dinners were obtained for her from the Stepney Invalid Kitchen on her promising to discontinue the oatmeal for the baby. It soon became unnecessary to give the bottle at all, as the breast milk was found to be sufficient. The mothers were often found to be very ignorant as to what constitutes a suitable diet for babies and young children, and tea, bread soaked in tea, meat, fish, vegetables of all kinds were frequerftly given to infants under one year. 62 births referred to first-born children. As a rule these mothers knew less of infant feeding than the others, but were found to be very amenable to instructions and eager to learn ; whereas mothers who had several children were not so anxiou, to receive advice. The infants were fairly well cared for, being usually bathed once daily at first, but this duty was found to be neglected as the child grew older, especially if the mother had to go out to work to support the home. 42 The baby's clothing was frequently unsatisfactory, being neither suitable nor sufficiently warm. Flannelette was found to be used oftener than flannel, short sleeves tied to the shoulders were more often seen than those reaching to the wrists. Garments with long sleeves were advised, with success in some cases. Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and bad colds were common. This can hardly be wondered at considering how careless some mothers were, often leaving a hot stuffy room and standing at the street door on the very coldest of days without first having protected the child with a shawl or other extra garment. It was found to be very difficult to persuade the mothers to use a separate cot for the baby. Two infants who were on the Health Visitor's visiting list were suffocated while in bed with the parents. Very few cases of wilful neglect were found, but two of the worst cases were referred to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 130 of the mothers were employed in factories, workshops, in the fish curing industry and as office cleaners. 80 were employed at home as outworkers in the tailoring, brushmaking and cardbox-making trades. 25 kept small shops. Some of the mothers understand very little about cooking, and have no idea as to what constitutes a nutritive diet for young children. Very little trouble is taken to prepare a dinner, "fried fish and chips" seems to be very popular, and enough money is spent on this that would purchase materials for a far more nourishing and digestible meal. 70 of the children died suddenly, which resulted in inquests being held: 25 deaths were due to Pneumonia, Bronchitis and Convulsions; 12 to Diarrhoea; 11 to Marasmus; 2 being due to want of attention at birth, and 18 were premature births, &c. 8 cases were referred to the Charity Organisation Society, but the Society does not assist the families of persons who are unemployed unless they have immediate prospects of work. It will assist to keep the family while the bread winner is in the hospital. (1) A consumptive patient was admitted an in-patient to the Victoria Park Chest Hospital, and his family was maintained by the C.O.S. during his absence from home. 43 (2) A woman, recently confined, was sent to the London Hospital. The C.O.S. paid the cab fare and supplied food to the family. (3) Convalescent treatment was applied for on behalf of a delicate mother with the first baby. This was granted but the mother refused to avail herself of it on account of the illness of her baby. (4) In one case, the father was out of work and the baby had died from Pneumonia before the Health Visitor made her first visit. Nine children out of 14 had previously died. At the time of the visit, two children aged 5 and 3 were suffering from Whooping Cough, and were in need of nourishment. No assistance was given. (5) In another instance, where the father was out of work and the mother was very delicate, assistance was refused. The baby was wasting and four children out of a family of seven had died. (6) Assistance was also refused where the mother was consumptive and the baby wasting. (7) The home had been sold to get food, and on March 7th, when the Health Visitor called, the family was without fire and food. The baby had not been washed as there was no fire to boil the water. The baby was in a fairly good condition. No assistance was given. (8) The baby had died before the Health Visitor called, and three children out of a family of four had died before they were a year old. The case was reported to the C.O.S., but the mother objected to answer the questions of the officer of the C.O.S., and made quite a different statement to what she had made to the Health Visitor. No assistance was given. 12 cases were referred to the Stepney Mothers and Babies' Welcome, 5 were granted free dinners and 7 were not assisted. The husbands were unemployed in every instance, the mothers were poorly nourished and the babies were suffering from Marasmus or wasting. (1) The baby weighed 64 lb. only when he was a month old. Free dinners were granted to the mother. She partook of one only and then stayed away. Shortly afterwards she resumed work. (2) The mother resumed work on the third day after her confinement. She had previously lost three children from wasting. She was granted free dinners for two months, and then left the neighbourhood. (3) One woman went once to the Mother's Welcome, and then stayed away Three of her children had died from wasting. 44 (4) Baby when he was three months old, weighed 7 lb. 13 oz. The mother was given a dinner daily but the baby died 12 days later. (5) The mother stated that she almost starved since she ceased work three months previous to the birth of the baby. This was the second child and he died in three weeks, the first child having lived 6 hours only. Dinners were obtained from the Edinburgh Castle for one mother for 6 weeks. Other cases were referred to the Relieving Officer, but in most cases the Health Visitor was informed that they preferred to starve rather than apply to the Relieving Officer. Old Age. 216 deaths were attributed to Old Age. This corresponds to a death rate of .68 per 1,000. 51 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .85 per 1.000. 17 belonged to the St. Georges-in-the-East, or at the rate of .31 per 1,000. 111 belonged to the Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .91 per 1,000. 37 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .45 per 1,000.

The death rate throughout the whole Borough was .09 per 1,000 of the population. As I have mentioned in previous reports, the death rate from Alcoholism is gradually and steadily declining in the Borough, as is shown in the following table:— In 1901 the death rate was .33 per 1,000 of the population. „ 1902 „ .33 „ 1,000 „ 1903 ,, .25 ., 1,000 „ 1904 „ .31 „ 1,000 „ 1905 „ .21 „ 1,000 „ 1906 „ .23 „ 1,000 „ 1907 ,, .15 „ 1,000 „ 1908 „ .15 „ 1,000 „ 1909 „ .16 „ 1,000 „ 1910 „ .09 „ 1,000 Cancer. The deaths due to Cancer were 228, or 26 more than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death rate of .72 per 1,000. 54 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .90 per 1,000. 35 belonged to St. Georges-in-the-East, or at the rate of .04 per 1,000. 80 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate, of .66 per 1,000. 59 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .71 per 1,000. Deaths of the Homeless and of Inmates of Common Lodging; Houses. During the year, there occurred in lunatic asylums the deaths of 74 persons stated to have been removed into such institutions from this district, but for whom no definite addresses could be given when the deaths were reported to the Registrars. Twelve of these were stated to have been removed from the Limehouse district. 6 from St. George-in-the-East, 22 from Mile End Old Town, and 34 from the Whitechapel district. 46 There were 170 deaths in public institutions of persons admitted from common lodging houses in the Borough. Thirty-five per cent. of these deaths were attributed to consumption and nearly 10 per cent. were due to cancer. As the Borough possesses a river fiontage of 2½ miles, a number of unknown persons are found drowned on the foreshore. These deaths are included in the death statistics for the districts in which the bodies are discovered. The bodies of 6 unknown persons were found and were included in the Limehouse returns, together with those of 7 unknown persons who died in the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, and 3 in the Stepney Workhouse. Six children with unknown addresses died at the Carshalton Infirmary; 3 were stated to have been removed from Limehouse, 1 from St. George's, and 2 from Mile End. In the St. George's returns are included the deaths of 3 persons with unknown addresses who died in the St. George's Infirmary. In the Mile End returns are included 6 deaths of persons who died under similar conditions in Mile End Infirmary. In the Whitechapel returns there are included 72 deaths of persons with unknown addresses, 67 of which occurred in the Whitechapel Infirmary and Workhouse, 5 in the London Hospital, and 1 in the street. Verminous Persons. 1,520 persons were cleansed during the year, and their clothing disinfected. Of these, 1,268 were adults—1.266 males and 2 females—252 children were cleansed, all of school ages—207 being boys and 45 girls. Most, if not all the adults, were inmates of Medland Hall. As the latter is a free shelter, and men come from all parts of London to sleep there, it will be seen that persons who are cleansed at our Disinfecting Station are not necessarily ratepayers or residents. This privilege is being taken advantage of to a greater extent from year to year. In 1906 30 persons were cleansed. In 1907 22 persons were cleansed. In 1908 173 persons were cleansed. In 1909 883 persons were cleansed. In 1910 1,520 persons were cleansed. Only one bath is available, and the advisability of enlarging the baths became a subject of discussion on several occasions by the Public Health Committee during 47 the year. It was felt that as this became necessary on account of Medland Hall and other lodging houses, as well as to an increasing number of schoolchildren, the London County Council should contribute towards the cost either by paying a certain amount for every bath, or to give land for the purpose of erecting new baths. The Education Committee was prepared to pay for the School Children, but the Public Health Committee was not prepared to pay towards the cost of bathing inmates of common lodging houses. In order to fully understand the present position, it may be as well to give a short resume of the Acts of Parliament referring to the cleansing of verminous persons, and of the correspondence with the London County Council. The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, empowered Local Authorities to expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants for the purpose of the proper cleansing of persons infested with vermin. The Local Authority had the power to permit such person to have the use free of charge of the apparatus which the authority possesses, for cleansing the person and his clothing from vermin. The London County Council (Genera! Powers) Act, 1904, empowered the Local Authorities to cleanse, purify, or destroy articles which the Medical Officer of Health certifies are filthy, dangerous or unwholesome. On the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health that any house or part of a house is infested with vermin, the owners may be compelled to stiip, cleanse rooms, houses, or part of such houses that are so infested. Section 21 of this Act applies Section 59 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, compelling sanitary authorities to provide means for cleansing, purifying and destroying filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, the following powers have been conferred on the County Council:— (1) The Medical Officer or his representative may, in any school within the County, provided or maintained by the Council as the Education Authority, examine the person and clothing of any child attending such school, and if on examination, he is of opinion that the person or clothing is infested with vermin, or is in a foul or dirty condition, the Medical Officcr may give notice in writing to the parent or guardian requiring him to cleanse properly the person and clothing of such child within 24 hours after the receipt of such notice. (2) If on the receipt of the notice he fails to comply therewith within the prescribed time, the Medical Officer or his representative may remove the child from school to suitable premises and detain him until such cleansing is effected. Section 37 enables the Medical Officer of the County Council to enforce the cleansing of the person and clothing of the inmates of common lodging houses. 48 Section 38 gives power to the County Council to make arrangements with Sanitary Authorities and carry into effect agreements for the purpose of cleansing of the person and clothing of the above mentioned cases. Following upon these provisions it was resolved by the London County Council in February, 1908. that:— (a) The provisions of the Act of 1907 with respect to verminous inmates of common lodging-houses should be carried out by the Public Health Committee' and that they should have power to enter into agreements or arrangements; and (b) that the provisions with respect to verminous children attending schools should be exercised by the Education Committee, and that regulations affecting such children should be made by such Committee; but (c) that arrangements with sanitary authorities should be made through one Committee, namely—the Public Health Committee. The Children Act, 1908, reproduces the clauses in the General Powers Act, 1907, with respect to the examination of children attending school, giving notice to cleanse the person and clothing of any verminous child. After the person or clothing of a child has been cleansed by a local education authority under the Children Act, if the parent or guardian allows him to get into such a condition that it is again necessary to proceed under this section, the parent or guardian shall on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding 10s. Where the sanitary authority within the district of a local authority have provided, or are entitled to the use of any premises or appliances for cleansing the person or clothing of persons infested with vermin, the Sanitary Authority shall, if so required by the local Education Authority, allow the Local Education Authority to use such premises and appliances for the purpose of this section upon such payment (if any) as may be agreed between them, or, in default of an agreement, settled by the Local Government Board. In July, 1909, as a result of correspondence between the Borough Council and the London County Council, a letter was received from the Clerk of the Council stating that the County Council was not prepared to contribute towards the capital expenses incurred in the extenson of the cleansing station; but (hat it would be prepared to consider as to making a capitation grant for the cleansing of school children and common lodging-house inmates dealt with under the Children Act, 1908, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. In March, 1910, the Clerk to the County Council wrote to inquire: (1) whether the Borough Council would be prepared to cleanse any persons from Common Lodging-houses in the Borough, if sent by the Council and (2) whether, in the event 49 of the Council of neighbouring Boroughs not having made proper provisions, the Stepney Council would be prepared to enter into an arrangement for the cleansing of inmates from lodging-houses in that neighbouring borough, if sent by the Council, and if so, what arrangements the Borough Council would suggest. To this letter, the Town Clerk, at the request of (he Public Health Committee replied that the Public Health Committee would be prepared to recommend the Borough Council to deal with this matter if satisfactory terms can be arranged. The Committee called the attention of the County Council to the vacant site belonging to the Council, which adjoins our disinfecting station and that it appeared to the Public Health Committee the best method of dealing with this matter would be by erection of a properly equipped cleansing station on that site. The Committee reminded the County Council that there is only one bath available for verminous persons and that this bath is situate in a building which was provided for the reception of "contacts" with infectious diseases. In the case of a severe epidemic, it might be necessary, if all the other premises provided by the Council are occupied, to use the building for its original purpose, when, of course, the bath would not be available for verminous persons. After further correspondence, a communication was received in May, 1910, from the Education Offices of the London County Council, stating that the Committee had provisionally agreed upon the general outline of the following scheme for the treatment of children throughout London:— (1) That the cleansing station provided by the various Metropolitan Borough Councils should, as far as possible, be utilised by agreement with the Borough Councils. (2) That the treatment of children should be entirely distinct from any establishment used for the isolation of suspected cases of infectious disease contacts. (3) That the exclusive use of the baths for the cleansing of children should be allowed on certain days. (4) That the cleansing station should be in a convenient position and that the children should be efficiently supervised with female attendants for the treatment of the girls. (5) That a uniform payment to the Borough Councils at the rate of 2s. per child, irrespective of the number of baths required before a child can be regarded as cleansed, should be arranged throughout London. D 50 (6) That this scheme be subject to the Borough Councils undertaking where necessary, to deal with the homes of the children cleansed. As the above communication made no reference to the treatment of adults, a letter was addressed to the Clerk of the County Council, with regard to the latter, but up to the present time no satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to the cleansing of verminous persons from common lodging-houses, &c. Glanders. Under the London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907, the Veterinary Inspector of the London County Council reported, in accordance with the provision of that Act, the existence of Glanders in fourteen stables in the Borough, in which 16 horses contracted the disease, or 69 less than in the previous year. Anthrax. One horse was reported to have suffered from Anthrax. The stables were immediately disinfected, and no second case occurred. Articles of Bedding Destroyed at Request of Owners.

Nine premises were removed from the register, due to their unsuitability, and 71 were refused registration for a similar reason. 135 premises were registered conditionally, but they were mostly transfers. Each shop was considered on its merits and certain conditions were imposed before it was registered. The conditions for every new registration generally included that— (1) The shop, milk receptacles and utensils must be kept scrupulously clean. The milk must also be kept in a cleanly condition. (2) The milk must be covered by a proper ventilated cover ; paper, muslin, or a plain board is not allowed. (3) Boxes of minerals, or other boxes, sacks, bags, &c., must not be allowed to remain on the floor, but raised on shelves at least a foot from the floor.

The total number of workshops on the Register was 3,452, hut this does not nclude factories, workplaces and outworkers premises. 5,540 inspections revealed defects, which necessitated the service of 1,552 written notices, 36 of these referred to factories, 1,483 to workshops including workshop laundries, and 33 to workplaces other than outworkers' premises. Cleanliness.—937 notices were served to properly cleanse workshops. Ventilation.—The ventilation of 92 workshops was improved. Overcrowding.—Overcrowding was abated in 39 workshops. Sanitary Accommodation.—The sanitary accommodation was improved in 187 workshops by providing additional and suitable water-closets. Outworkers' Premises.—3,762 inspections were made to outworkers' premises during the year, 631 premises were found to be insanitary, and notifiable diseases occurred in 76. The number of inspections appears to be small compared to the number of addresses of outworkers received from other Councils. These premises are mostly registered workshops and are included as such in our returns, although they may be deemed outworkers' premises inasmuch as work is carried on there for business houses in other districts. They are included in the column of addresses of outworkers' premises received from other Councils, but the record of visits made to them is included in the number of visits made to registered workshops. Again, a large percentage of these addresses are false, and on being visited by the Inspectors, it is found that the people have left many years previously in some instances, or have never lived there at all. These visits are not counted. 80 FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES AND HOMEWORK 1.—INSPECTIONS. Premises. Number of Inspections. Written Notices. Prosecutions.
