Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting herewith ray annual report for the year 1943, which, in accordance with the suggestions of the Ministry of Health, is an abridged report. Certain statistics relating to population are omitted for security reasons and the Registrar General's estimate of the population of the Borough is therefore not recorded. Because of war conditions no accurate comparisons can be made with the statistics of former years. The birth rate rose from 17.6 in 1942 to 18.8. The death rate was slightly higher than last year. The infantile mortality rate per 1000 live births was 53.2 compared with 52.0 last year. The maternal mortality rate decreased from 3.74 to 2.1 per thousand live and still births. One woman in the Borough died of senile myocarditis at the age of 100 years. Compared with last year there were 780 more rases of infectious disease notified, mainly Measles and Scarlet Fever. Notifications of Measles increased from 250 in 1942 to 918 this year. Scarlet Fever from 130 to 194, Pneumonia from 93 to 124, whilst Whooping Cough decreased from 158 to 142, Diphtheria from 47 to 45, Puerperal Fever and Pyrexia from 12 to 5. There was no Smallpox.

All health services were maintained throughout the year at almost peace-time standards. The number of children immunised against diphtheria decreased from 2964 to 2073 Scabies treatment was given to 2373 persons. The three war-time day nurseries maintained record attendances throughout-the year. Three basement bakehouses were removed from the register, having been out of action for over 12 months, leaving only 23 of the original 69 certificated in 1904. In addition to their normal duties several member of the Staff, including Sanitary Inspectors, continued to undertake Civil Defence duties at the Report and Control Centre after hours and at week-ends. Other duties include food salvage, food decontamination, gas identification officers and emergency mortuary supervision and inspection of shelters and rest and feeding centres. i should like to record my appreciation of the work of the staff of the Department and to the Chairmen of Committees who have given me their support and encouragement I offer my grateful thanks. i am, Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F.R. 0'SHIEL.
