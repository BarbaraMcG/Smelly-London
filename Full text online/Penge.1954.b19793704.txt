To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present an Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1954, which has been compiled in accordance with Circulars 1/54 and 28/54 of the Ministry of Health. The Vital Statistics for the year show the lowest death rate recorded in the district since 1932, and the birth rate, though lower than last year, still remains above the average for England and Wales. Unfortunately the stillbirth rate remains high and again a maternal death has to be recorded. Whilst the death rate for cancer remains below the average for the country as a whole that for tuberculosis is above. It will be observed later in the report an increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis notified and on the register at the end of this year. This is partly accounted for by a routine X-ray examination of the inmates of an institution in the district and 21 of the new cases were inmates of this place. A study of the table of causes of death shows that cardiovascular disease is much the commonest cause of death and that although the site of the lesion varies according to the sex the numbers affected are almost equal. Cancer in all its forms claimed more deaths in men than women and cancer of the lung was returned as the cause of death in men only. Respiratory diseases, other than tuberculosis, are lower in number and again are more frequent in men than women. Infectious diseases have been few with the exception of an outbreak of Sonne dysentery in April to which reference is made later in the report, and an increase in the number of cases of Scarlet fever. For the seventh successive year no case of diphtheria has been reported, a solid proof of the value of immunisation. Too few parents, however, are taking advantage of the opportunities for their children to receive the reinforcing inoculations which are such an essential part in maintaining immunity to the disease. These are given at 4½ and 8½ years and should never be missed, but in spite of the larger number of children of school age fewer of them received these reinforcing injections than last year. Diphtheria can still occur in the district and can cause quite a number of cases before being brought under control. I should like once again to pay tribute to the excellent work done in the district by the various voluntary bodies in the provision of meals, clubs and homes for the aged. Towards the end of the year the Council decided to initiate a campaign in connection with personal hygiene and clean food. To this end handbills were distributed early in 1955 through the schools, welfare centre and public library and posters displayed on various sites in the district. 4 A few cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, further details of which appear elsewhere. I would, however, again stress that safe food can only be obtained by scrupulous attention to hygiene, not only in the manufacture and in the retailing, but also in the home, both in the preparation and in the storage of food. Further progress has been made during the year with new housing projects, and this factor with the resultant lessening of overcrowding should continue to produce satisfactory figures as regard the health of Penge. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-Year 1954 (estimated by Registrar-General) 25,450 Rateable Value, 1st October, 1954 £207,170 Sum represented by 1d. rate £836 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33.0 this being the highest in the County of Kent. The remains of the Crystal Palace and the greater part of the grounds occupying 127 acres, are within the district and provide a much needed "lung" for the area. The district is mainly residential although there is an amount of light industrial work in the district, the chief industries being engineering, button making, printing and laundry work. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 80 men and 25 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Crude Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 19.05 Adjusted Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 17.14 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 0.62 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 31.93 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 10.37 Adjusted Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 9.64 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 1.99 Death Rates of Infants under One Year of Age All infants per 1,000 live births 26.80 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 28.32 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births Nil 5 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 485, compared with 535 in 1953. This gives a crude live birth rate of 19.05 per 1,000 Home Population, compared with 20.97 for 1953. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local birth rates is 0.90. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 17.14, compared with 18.87 in 1953. The birth rate for England and Wales was 15.2. Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 16, equal to a rate of 31.93 per 1,000 total births, compared with 32.55 for 1953. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 264, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 10.37 per 1,000 Home population, compared with 11.32 for 1953. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.93. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 9.64, compared with 10.52 for 1953. The Death Rate for England and Wales was 11.3. Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 22. A large proportion of the deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths 190 or 71.9% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 68.1 % the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 42.4% of the total deaths, compared with 43.9% in 1953. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 41 giving a death rate per 1,000 Home population of 1.61, compared with 1.88 in 1953. The rate for England and Wales was 2.03. Tuberculosis The death rate per 1,000 Home population was 0.23 against 0.35 in 1953. The rate for England and Wales was 0.18. Maternal Mortality There was one maternal death during the year, equal a rate of 1.99 per 1,000 (live and still) births, compared with a rate of 1.80 for 1953. The rate for England and Wales was 0.69, compared with 0.76 in 1953. 6 Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year of age was 13, corresponding to a rate of 26.80 per 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 24.43 for 1953. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 25.5. Nine of the thirteen infants died under the age of four weeks, two of whom died from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1954. Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population Deaths under I year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 17.1 31.9 9.6 26.8 England and Wales 15.2 23.4 11.3 25.5 160 County Boroughs and Great Towns including London 16.8 25.6 9.6 29.2 160 Smaller Towns (resident populations, 25,000 to 50,000 at Census, 1951) 15.4 22.4 11.3 23.8 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the district being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The County Pathologist reports that the samples of water submitted to him quarterly were good. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Four storage cisterns were renewed, cleansed or covered. Drainage and Sewerage. All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewerage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. No important additions to existing works of sewerage have been made during the year. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. 7 Public Cleansing House refuse was collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with and there is a regular collection of pig food from bins placed in the various roads. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. HOUSING The erection of 39 flats by the local authority was completed during the year. Private builders erected 11 dwellinghouses and 12 flats and provided 11 flats by converting existing houses. 1.

PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria For the seventh year in succession no cases of diphtheria occurred in the district. Diphtheria Immunisation The following is a return of the number of children resident in the district who were immunised against diphtheria during the year:— Children born Children born 1950-1954 1940-1949 Totals Primary inoculations 414 35 449 Reinforcing 45 311 356 Penge children under the age of 15 years on the 31st December, 1954, who had completed a course of immunisation at any time before that date were as follows:— Aged 0-4 years inclusive 1,579 „ 5-14 „ „ 2,843 Smallpox No case was notified and no Penge contacts of cases occurring elsewhere were reported. The following shows the number of Penge residents who were vaccinated against smallpox during the year:— Age at 31/12/54. Under 1 1 to 4 5 to 14 15 or over Total. Vaccinated 193 161 8 5 367 Re-vaccinated 4 5 8 17 9 Scarlet Fever There were 79 cases of Scarlet Fever notified (as against 38 in 1953) and 37 cases were removed to hospital. The disease generally was of a mild type and there were no "return" cases. No deaths were recorded. Poliomyelitis One case occurred during the year, this being non-paralytic. Sonne Dysentery In April an outbreak commenced and during the following months until November a total 269 cases were notified involving 106 families. In all, faecal specimens obtained from cases and their contacts numbered 2,120 of which 526 were positive. It was again noticeable that a high proportion of cases were found in the larger families, in fact 28 families with four or more cases provided 134 or half the total cases. There is no doubt that the spread of the disease was due to inattention to personal hygiene and at no time was there any suspicion of the supply of contaminated food in any canteen or shop. Measles As was to be expected a marked drop in the number of notifications occurred. A total of 11 cases was notified during the year compared with 620 in the previous year. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough Cases were notified throughout the year and totalled 45, compared with 143 cases in 1953. There were no deaths. It is to be hoped that with the increased use of vaccine against this disease it will continue to decline. Disinfection Verminous rooms disinfested 87 Rooms fumigated 83 Mattresses disinfected 93 Blankets disinfected 143 Pillows disinfected 117 Miscellaneous articles disinfected 250 10 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (Other than Tuberculosis) during the year 1954 Disease Total Cases notified Cases admitted to Hospitals Total Deaths Scarlet fever 79 37 — Pneumonia 11 2 10 (all forms) Poliomyelitis — Non-Paralytic 1 1 — Erysipelas 5 2 — Measles 11 5 — Whooping cough 45 — — Dysentery 269 .. — — Food poisoning 11 5 — Meningococcal infection 1 1 2 Puerperal pyrexia 1 — — Ophthalmia neonatorum 1 . . — — Tuberculosis No action was necessary under the Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations 1925, or under section 172, Public Health Act, 1936.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 It was necessary to take urgent action and obtain a Magistrate's emergency order for the compulsory removal to hospital of an old lady who was ill and incapable of looking after herself. Further applications were made to the Magistrate's Court for her continued detention in hospital and granted. Under section 50 of the Act, it is the duty of the local authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of the body of any person who has died in their area if it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have or are being made. During the year three bodies were dealt with by the Council under these provisions. NEW TUBERCULOSIS CASES AND MORTALITY DURING 1954.

Four dairies are registered under the Milk & Dairies Regulations, 1949. Regular inspections of food shops, restaurants and stores have been made and advice given in hygienic food preparation and handling, particular stress being paid to the importance of personal hygiene. The hygienic storage and handling of food continued to show improvement. As will be seen in the Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report, a considerable amount of food has been surrendered by the food traders and their applications for examinations to be made of foodstuffs of which they are doubtful as to the fitness, helps to safeguard the purity of the food supply. No animals were slaughtered in the district. Food poisoning Six isolated cases due to salmonella organisms were reported, but it was not possible to obtain specimens of food eaten to identify the cause. Five other cases occurred in one family which necessitated their removal to hospital, as a result of the sudden onset of blurred vision, dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting, soon after eating mushrooms grown in their own garden shed. Tests of mushrooms and fungi proved negative and no definite evidence could be obtained of the cause of the attack. A set of posters illustrating the causes of and advice on how to prevent food poisoning was exhibited in a prominent position in the Public Library, and the School and Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics. Other posters were displayed on notice boards in the district and at school canteens. The great importance of thoroughly washing their hands after using the watercloset cannot be too strongly emphasised to all persons engaged in handling food, whether in the factory, shop, canteen or the home. MORTUARY During the year 34 bodies were brought to the Mortuary where post mortem examinations were conducted by a Home Office Pathologist. A refrigerating chamber is installed in the mortuary. 13 My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation at all times.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you my twenty-seventh Annual Report on the work of the Sanitary Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1954. During the year 731 complaints (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the great majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints were investigated and appropriate action taken when found necessary. Applications for certificates of disrepair were received in respect of 36 premises. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises, 493 written informal notices and 60 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. 433 intimation notices and 56 statutory notices were complied with. The Local Authority, in default of the owners, had carried out works required by one statutory notice served under Section 94, Public Health Act, 1936, and three notices served under Section 75. The Council also did the work required by 7 notices served under Section 24, Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains) at 10 premises. The amount of repair work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen on reference to the summary of work executed. Every endeavour is made informally to have notices complied with before statutory action is taken. In twenty-four premises, however, repairs were not executed until legal proceedings against the owners or agents were either threatened or taken. It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against the owners or agents of 11 properties in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects, with the following results:— 17 case no. result 1 and 2 Non-compliance with Nuisance Orders. Fined £5.0.0. and £1. 11.6. costs in each case. 3Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £2. 0. 0. 4, 7, 8 and 9 Work done prior to hearing. Summonses withdrawn on payment of costs. 5 and 11 Nuisance Order made to do work in 42 days in each case. 6 Nuisance Order made to do work in two months. 10 Nuisance Order made to do work in six weeks and pay £1. 1.0. costs. In all these cases the defendants were ordered to pay Court costs. Closing Orders were made under Section 10, Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953, in lieu of demolition orders, in respect of one semi-detached house and one terraced house. Closing Orders were made under section 12, Housing Act, 1936, respecting two basement flats which did not comply with the regulations as to underground rooms and could not be made fit for human habitation at a reasonable cost. One house and shop was demolished following the making of a Demolition Order in 1953. The drainage system of 43 premises were relaid or partially relaid and 61 cleared of obstructions. Disinfestation of 87 rooms found to be verminous was carried out. Five licences to deal in game were issued during the year. From April to November during the outbreak of dysentery, a great deal of your Inspector's time was taken up in visiting cases and contacts, obtaining specimens of faeces therefrom periodically and in the multifarious duties arising in connection with the control of the outbreak. Mr. H. J. Bishop, Sanitary Inspector, resigned on 7th November 1954, on being appointed as a Sanitary Inspector with the County Borough of Norwich. The vacancy was not filled until the 11th February, 1955. 18 SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS AND VISITS The following summary shows the number of visits and inspections made:— Inspections through complaints received 731 Housing Acts 75 Overcrowding and measurement of rooms 26 Infectious diseases 743 Houses-let-in-lodgings and Common lodging houses 119 Bakehouses 41 Dairies and milk distributors 96 Meat shops 163 Fish frying shops 40 Ice cream shops 96 Cafes and restaurants 164 Food factories 160 Other food shops, stores and stalls 525 Public conveniences 61 Stables 33 Rats and mice 202 Factories 189 Outworkers28 Schools 19 Smoke observations 21 Drain tests 189 Keeping of animals 22 Food and water sampling 134 Movable dwellings 10 Rag Flock and Pet Animals Acts 24 Transferable deaths 104 Revisits and inspections of works in hand 3,347 Miscellaneous visits 195 Shops Act inspections and patrols 442 Heating Appliances Act 14 SUMMARY OF WORK EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR Water Supply:— Water supply reinstated to houses 36 Water service pipes repaired 81 Cisterns cleansed, covered or covers repaired 4 Water Closets:— New pans and traps fixed 32 Flushing apparatus renewed or repaired 30 Foul pans and traps cleansed 10 Connection of flushing pipes to pans made good 8 Seats and doors provided or repaired 18 Ventilation provided or improved 4 Walls repaired 3 Flooring or paving repaired 5 Artificial lighting provided 3 19 Drainage:— Drains tested with smoke, water or colour 189 Drains cleared 61 Houses with drains relaid or partially relaid 43 Inspection chambers constructed or improved 10 Soil and ventilation pipes fixed or repaired 17 Sinks, lavatory basins and baths provided 8 Sink fillets repaired 2 Waste pipes renewed or provided 9 Waste pipes repaired or trapped 16 Waste pipes cleared 8 Fresh-air-inlets provided or repaired 7 Dampness—Houses with:— Walls repointed or rendered 16 Dampness in ground floors remedied 33 Roofs repaired 107 Gutters repaired or renewed 23 Rainwater pipes repaired or renewed 17 Ventilation under floors provided or improved 3 Water service pipes repaired 81 Window sills repaired 7 Cleanliness:— Dirty rooms, etc. cleansed 101 Verminous rooms disinfested 87 Miscellaneous:— Houses with floors, joists, etc. repaired 48 Houses with skirtings repaired 6 Houses with plaster repaired 86 Houses with new sashlines provided to windows 34 Houses with window frames, etc. repaired 25 Houses with yard or forecourts paved or repaired 5 Houses with scullery paving repaired 4 Houses with chimneys repaired 24 Houses with airbricks renewed 4 Houses with stairs repaired 9 Houses with front and back steps repaired 5 Houses with fireplace jambs and mantels repaired 9 Houses with brickwork repaired 11 Kitchen stoves repaired or renewed 6 Other stoves repaired or renewed 25 Scullery coppers repaired or renewed 1 Hearths renewed or repaired 7 Doors and frames repaired or renewed 14 Ventilation and lighting of rooms improved 5 New dustbins provided 96 Premises with miscellaneous defects repaired 10 Accumulations removed 15 Animal nuisances abated 2 20 HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954 This Act, which came into force on the 30th August, 1954, enables a landlord whose property is in good condition to claim a repairs increase on the rent, provided he serves the necessary notices declaring that he has satisfied the expenditure test, etc. If the tenant is dissatisfied with the condition of his house he can apply to the local authority for a certificate of disrepair. If this is granted the increase in the rent can be withheld until such time as the landlord remedies the items of disrepair enumerated in the certificate and obtains from the local authority a certificate of revocation. By the end of the year 36 applications for certificates of disrepair had been received from tenants and in every case a certificate was issued. One application was received for the revocation of a certificate of disrepair and this was granted, the necessary repairs having been executed. In several other cases the repairs were in hand at the end of the year. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out, 1,285 visits being made in this connection. On a few occasions the attention of the persons concerned was called to contraventions of the byelaws made under section 15, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, but in none of these cases was it considered necessary to take statutory action. Legal proceedings were taken against a butcher in respect of two offences under section 13, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, regarding dirty conditions and equipment in his premises. He was also prosecuted under section 9 of the Act on three charges of having in his possession for sale food which was unfit for human consumption. Fines amounting to £21.0.0. were imposed and he was ordered to pay £3. 3. 0. costs. The Public Health Committee gave consideration to the cancellation of the registration of his premises used in the manufacture of preserved food and after hearing the explanations of the butcher and a report that thorough repair and cleansing of the premises had been carried out decided to adminster a severe warning and not to cancel the registration of the premises. This action proved effective. Your sanitary inspectors continued to give advice to occupiers of food premises on matters relating to food and general hygiene. Communications were sent to the occupiers of 15 food premises regarding defects found, and in each case the work was carried out after informal action. The attention of the department was drawn on a few occasions to the presence of a foreign body in, or contamination of, food purchased in the district. The vendors concerned were interviewed and the circumstances fully investigated. In one case concerning a drawing pin in a loaf of bread legal proceedings were taken under section 3, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and the Magistrates imposed a fine of £20. 0. 0. and costs, previous convictions having been proved against the firm concerned. In other cases a warning was given. The amount of food surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption after examination by your inspectors was 3 tons, 13 cwts., 1 qr., 10 lbs. 21 The foods condemned were as follows:— Bacon 280 lbs. Sausages 2 lbs. Beef 2,928 „ Vermicelli 4 „ Cheese 166 „ Baking powder 60 tins Dried fruit 143 „ Honey 1 jar Fish 574 „ Lemon cheese 1 „ Flour 574 „ Tinned fish 14 tins Ham 14 „ „ fruit 84 „ Lambs' livers 30 ham 46 „ Mutton 49 „ „ meat 82 „ Ox kidneys 60 „ „ meat pudding 6 „ Pigs' „ 98 „ „ milk 31 „ Pigs' livers 5 „ „ soup 6 „ Pork 375 „ „ syrup 3 „ Potatoes 3,024 „ „ vegetables 135 „ Salt 112 „ Eggs 720 Condemnation certificates totalled 172. The condemned foods were disposed of by incineration or by use for industrial purposes. The co¬operation of the food traders in bringing to the notice of the department the existence of suspected unsound food has been maintained. Milk Supply There are no cowsheds or pasteurising plants in the district. All milk sold in the district is special designated milk in sealed containers. There are four dairies on the register and 27 persons are registered as distributors. Milk (Special Designations) Orders The following licences were issued:— Dealers' Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 5 Pasteurised milk 10 Sterilised milk 15 Supplementary Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 6 Pasteurised milk 6 Sterilised milk 6 Milk sampling Samples of milk submitted to chemical analysis totalled 42, and all proved to be genuine. The samples gave the following averages:— Fat—3.54% (standard 3.0%). Solids-not-fat—8.78% (standard 8.5%). 22 Twenty-eight samples of pasteurised milk and eight samples of tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk were submitted to the Phosphatase and Methylene Blue tests and all satisfied the tests. Six samples of sterilised milk were examined and satisfied the Turbidity Test. Ice-Cream There are no manufacturers in the district, but 81 premises are registered for the sale of ice-cream, the shopkeepers obtaining their supplies from wellknown manufacturers. In the great majority of cases the ice-cream is delivered to the premises and sold in cartons or wrapped. Forty-six samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the Methylene Blue test with the following results:— Grade 1—22; Grade 2—13; Grade 3—6; Grade 4—5. The samples graded 3 and 4 were all obtained over a period from one firm who manufactured the ice-cream in a London borough and retailed the wrapped ice-cream by means of roundsmen from a store in this district. Investigations were made at the place of manufacture by the authority concerned, test samples taken at different stages in the process and advice given on the hygienic preparation and manufacture of ice-cream. This action resulted in the desired improvement of the ice-cream. The periodic investigations at the Penge store showed that the storage facilities here were in order and did not in any way account for the low grading of some of the samples taken locally. This firm subsequently ceased to store and sell ice-cream in Penge. In no case was ice-cream found to be stored at a temperature exceeding 28° Fahrenheit. Slaughterhouses No animals were slaughtered in the district. Adulteration The Kent County Sampling Officers took 112 samples of various foods and drugs in this district. Included in the total were 33 samples of milk, 18 of drugs and 10 of spirits. All the samples were genuine with the exception of the following:— article analysis action taken Iced lollies Deficient in sugar. Inferior 11.0% deficient minimum amount of meat. Adulterated. Particulars recorded. „ 12.0% „ Taken in connection with a complaint. Legal proceedings. Fine £5. Your inspectors obtained 42 informal samples of milk, the Analyst reporting all samples to be genuine. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1948 Visits paid to factories totalled 189 and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, 12 written notices were served and complied with. These dealt mainly with insufficient and defective sanitary conveniences and want of cleanliness. Notices were received in respect of 19 Penge residents who were employed in certain trades in their own homes but working for occupiers of factories in other districts. In no case was it found that work was being done in unwholesome premises. 23 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 230 regarding rats and mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. The constant action which has been taken to destroy rodents during recent years has caused a diminution in the severity of the infestations found in the district and in no case was a major infestation discovered. Rats are such prolific breeders, however, that it is in the public's interest to report to the public health department as soon as they suspect the presence of rodents in or on their premises. A free service is provided for the destruction of rodents in private dwellings. In several cases it was found that defective drains and sewers were associated with rat infestations and the keeping of animals contributed to the number of infestations. When considered necessary the drainage systems of premises were tested with smoke and colour and all defects found made good. As in previous years, the foul-water sewers were treated on two occasions, prebait and poisoned bait being laid in the manholes and side entrances. In June, 339 manholes were baited and pre-bait takes recorded in 99. The figures for the December treatment were 321 manholes baited and pre-bait takes recorded in 120. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of the work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and re-inspections made 3,102 Premises treated for rats 281 Premises where rat poison bait taken 235 Premises re-treated for rats 186 Estimated number of rats poisoned 683 Number of rats trapped 10 Premises treated for mice 97 Premises re-treated for mice 59 It was necessary to treat some premises on three or more occasions and the total treatments for the destruction of rodents numbered 760. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 The object of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Three premises are registered in connection therewith. Samples of materials used at each of the registered premises were obtained and the prescribed Analyst under the Act reported that the tests showed the samples to be satisfactory and complied with the requirements of the regulations. MOVABLE DWELLINGS The camping and caravan site of nearly three acres in the Crystal Palace Grounds established in 1951 continues to be occupied. Suites of waterclosets and lavatory basins are provided in a brick building on the site, and there are suitable arrangements for the collection and disposal of refuse. Periodic inspections were made of the camp and no cause for complaint arose during the year. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act came into force on the 1st April 1952, and regulates the sale of pet animals. Licences were granted to three applicants subject to conditions laid down by the Council, these conditions being based on those recommended by the R.S.P.C.A. No contraventions were observed. 24 SHOPS ACT, 1950 YOUNG PERSONS (EMPLOYMENT) ACT, 1938 Mr. E. G. Thomas, Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector and Shops Act Inspector, reports as follows:— Number of visits made 366 Number of evening patrols carried out 48 Number of Sunday patrols carried out 28 Number of premises where young persons employed 43 Number of premises where official forms relating to staff not posted up 11 Number of "mixed shops" where poster relating to Sunday trading not exhibited 5 Number of shops where toilet facilities were provided following service of intimation notice 1 Letters of warning were sent with reference to contravention of the Acts relative to the non-exhibition of forms relating to "mixed shops" when open, for Sunday trading, and for failing to post up official forms regarding employment of shop assistants and young persons. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952 and HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS 1953 These regulations became fully operative on the 1st October 1954, on and after which date it is an offence to sell or expose for sale certain heating appliances, unless fitted with an effective fireguard as prescribed in the regulations. As a result of this enactment and statutory instrument it was necessary to carry out the tests prescribed on heating appliances exposed for sale throughout the district. Number of premises where tests carried out 14 Number of premises where appliances failed to pass the prescribed tests 4 Letters were sent to the proprietors of these shops, who immediately withdrew the appliances from sale. Three of the premises were second-hand furniture shops. In the remaining case the heating appliances were exposed for sale in contravention of instructions given. The Managing Director immediately gave orders for these to be withdrawn from sale until the requisite guards had been fitted. I should like to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and assistance and to the Staff for their great help and efficient service during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. T. PEARCE, M.S.I.A., Chief Sanitary Inspector.
