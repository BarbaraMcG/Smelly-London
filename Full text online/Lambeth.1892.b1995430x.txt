The Vestry appointed Monday, the 29th May, 1893, for the Annual Election of Vestrymen and Auditors to supply the places of those members of the Vestry whose term of office expired by effuxion of time, as well as the following Vacancies occasioned by death and resignation, viz.:— Mr. R. Cocks, Brixton Ward, died. Mr. C. W. Ware, Prince's Ward, resigned. Mr. J. E. S. King, Brixton Ward, resigned. Mr. J. W. Thomas, Vauxhall Ward, resigned. Mr. II. J. Meech, South Marsh Ward, resigned.

A complete List of Vestrymen and Auditors for 1893-4 will be found on pages 4 to 10. 29 VESTRY RATES AND PRECEPTS. The making, levying, and collecting of the Vestry Rates are done by the Churchwardens and Overseers, upon whom the vestry make its Precepts for the several annual requirements of the Vestry. The following is a Comparative Statement for the two years (ending 25th March) 1892 and 1893. 1892. 1893 Rate Vestry Precept Rate Vestry Precept. £ s. d. £ s. d. 0/2½ 11.520 0 0 0/2 11,000 0 0 General Purpose 1/1 74,000 0 0 1/3½ 90,400 0 0 0/1½ 8 250 0 0 0/1 6530 0 0 School Hoard for London 1/0 69,009 8 11 11¾ 66,675 12 11 Totals 2/5 162.779 8 11 2/6 174.605 12 11 Over the expenditure of the School Board for London the Vestry have no direct control. The Poor Rate for the Year was 3/- in the and was made for the following purposes:— 1st. For the Relief of the Poor 1/4 2 2nd. „ Public Libraries 0/1 3rd. „ Police 0/5 4th. „ London County 1/1½ 30 QUALIFICATION OF VESTRYMEN. The Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 & 19 Vict., c. 120 Section 6, provides that in any parish in which the number of poor rate assessments at £40 or upwards docs not exceed one-sixth of the whole number of such assessments it shall not be necessary, in order to qualify a person to be a Vestryman, that the amount of rental upon which he is rated or assessed exceed £25. To ascertain if the present qualification of remained unaltered, an examination of the Rate Books on 25th March, 1893, was made, with the following result:— Collecting District. Total No. of Assessments. No. of Assessments of £40 and over. 1 3,352 712 2 3,171 704 3 3,269 444 4 3,804 269 5 3,590 543 6 3,338 797 7 3,321 636 8 3,408 389 9 3,500 658 10 3,126 427 11 3,096 481 12 3,385 1,059 13 3,477 582 14 742 152 44,579 7.853 One-sixth of Total Assessments is 7,429 Excess of Assessments at £40 or upwards over one-sixth of the whole number of Assessments 424. The qualification therefore remains at £40. 31 VAUXHALL PARK. It being found necessary to remove the house left standing in this park, formerly occupied by the late Professor Fawcett, M.P., it was resolved by the Vestry that the old materials should be sold by auction, and the proceeds appropriated to the erection on the site of a Memorial to Mr. Fawcett. The materials realized a net sum of £75 10s and application was made to Sir Henry Doulton to ascertain whether he could supply a Fountain made of his ware, and it was found that Sir Henry Doulton had on hand a very fine Fountain made of Doulton ware. Although the Fountain was probably of the value of £250, Sir Henry Doulton very generously agreed to accept the above sum of £75 10s. for it. Sir Henry Doulton intimated that he bad himself thought that a Statue, to be placed in Vauxhall Park, would be a suitable way of perpetuating the memory of Mr. Fawcett, and. if acceptable to the Vestry, Sir Henry expressed his willingness to place a Statue in the park at his own expense. The Vestry resolved to accept the offer of Sir Henry Doulton to sell the Fountain for the sum of £75 10s., and at the same time to express its thanks to him, not only for generously parting with the Fountain at so small a sum, but also for his great liberality in offering to present the proposed Statue to the Parish. On 2nd August, 1892, the Fountain was formally opened by the Chairman of the General Purposes Committee. On 7th June, 1893, the Memorial Statue was unveiled by His Grace The Archbishop of Canterbury in the presence of a distinguished company. 32 ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The Provisional Order granted by the Board of Trade was confirmed by Parliament by the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 6) Act, 1892, to which Act the Royal Assent was given on the 27th June, 1892. The Area of Supply comprised in the Order consists of the entire Parish of Lambeth, except (a) Westminster Bridge Road, and so much of the Parish as lies to the north of that road. (b) So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line drawn from the junction of Farquhar Road with Dulwich Park Road to the junction of Westow Hill, Upper Norwood, with Gipsy Hill. (c) The following bridges over the river Thames vested in the County Council, viz., Vauxhall, Lambeth, and Westminster. The Order comes into force on the day when the Act confirming the Order is passed. The Vestry, as the undertakers, are bound within two years after the commencement of the Order to lay down suitable and sufficient distributing mains throughout so much of the following streets as lies within the area of supply:— Lambeth Road Kcnnington Road Kennington Park Road Harleyford Road Harleyford Street South Lambeth Road Stockwell Road Clapham Road Camberwell New Road Brixton Road Brixton Hill Coldharbour Lane (Brixton Rd. to Gresham Rd Effra Road Tulse Hill Denmark Hill Heme Hill Norwood Road Knight's Hill Road Gresham Road Kennington Oval Lower Kennington Lane Upper Kennington Lane Albert Embankment 33 The Vestry is also bound, at any time after the expiration of eighteen months after the commencement of the Order, to lay down suitable and sufficient distributing mains throughout every do their street within the area of supply, upon being required to do go in manner by the Order provided, one condition of which being that the parties requiring the supply shall bind themselves to take a definite time such an amount of energy as will produce a reasonable proportion of the cost of laying down the required disiributing mains. The Board of Trade may revoke the Order at any time if they snavc reason to believe that the Vestry have made default in executing works or supplying energy in accordance with the provisions of the Order. This is in addition to other clauses in the Order which render the Vestry liable to penalties for not supplying energy and otherwise complying with the requirements of the (Order. In November, 1892, Mr. W. II. Preece, F.R.S., the Chief Consulting Kngineer to the Post Office Authorities, was consulted is to the best mode of carrying out the Lambeth Electric Lighting (Order. That gentleman made a very exhaustive Report to the "Vestry on the subject, and the Vestry, in February, 1893, passed the following resolutions, viz.:— 1. That it is expedient, in the interests of the Parish, that the Vestry should take immediate steps to put in force the provisions of the Lambeth Electric Lighting Order. 2. That the Committee be authorised to negotiate for a site for the central station satisfactory to Mr. Preece. 3. That Mr. Preece be authorised to prepare specifications defining the wants of the district for tenders to be received from contractors, and that Mr. Preece be requested to examine the tenders, and report to this Committee as to the acceptance of the most eligible. 4. That the Vestry be recommended to apply for power to borrow a sum of £75,000 to be solely applied for purposes of Electric Lighting under the Order, such amount to be actually borrowed in instalments as required during the next four years. On the 15th June, 1893, when the appointment by the Vestry of the various Committees after the election took place, the appointment of the Electric Lighting Committee was deferred. c 34 PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The Commissioners, appointed by the Vestry, submitted their first Report on 17th November, 1892, in which they recommended the Vestry to approve an Agreement which the Commissioners had (subject to confirmation by the Vestry) entered into with the Owners for the purchase of the site and buildings of the Ferndale Road Baths. The following is the substance of the Commissioners' Report to the Vestry:— A site was submitted to the Commissioners in Ferndale Road, Brixton, midway between the Clapham and Brixton Roads. On the site there is already a swimming bath, 150 feet in length, and 55 feet in breadth, which was formerly occupied and known as the Ferndale Road Baths; and the whole premises have been until Michaelmas last occupied and known as the Lambeth Polytechnic, the institution being carried on under the superintendence of the Rev. Freeman Wills. The entire site is upwards of an acre, the total area being 48,605 superficial feet. The property has to the north a frontage to the London, Chatham & Dover Railway of 366 feet; a frontage to Torrens Street, on the cast, of 168 feet, and to Tintern Street, on the west, of 46 feet; and includes a house, facing Ferndale Road on the south, with a frontage of 34 feet. The swimming bath, already referred to, is in good substantial repair. On the land arc an engine, with boilers, &c., and a well of good water, which up to this time has been quite sufficient to supply the swimming bath with water, and which will, it is hoped, be sufficient to supply all the water necessary for the complete baths and wash-houses contemplated by the Commissioners on the site. The price asked by the owners of the Ferndale Road site was £10,500, but, after considerable negotiation, the Vendors agreed to accept £8000 as the entire purchase money for the freehold of the property, Mr. Freeman Wills receiving a portion of the amount as a consideration for the transfer of a lease he held of the site, which had a term of 17 years unexpired, and under which he had a right to purchase the freehold for £8500 at any time prior to 1895. 35 It is understood that a sum of upwards of 120,000 was spent on the site by the old Baths Company, who sank the well and Prerected the swimming bath, and the Commissioners have been informed by the architect, Mr. Tiltman, selected by the Com- in missioners, that the cost of erecting the existing swimming baths would not be less than from £7000 to 8000, quite apart from the cost of the engine and boilers, or the house facing Ferndale Road. The price of for the entire property appeared, therefore, to the Commissioners a very reasonable one. In 1890 Messrs. Thynne Thynne, surveyors, of Great George Street, Westminster, valued the premises for the Polytechnic Authorities at £13,ooo, and the premises arc quite as valuable for She Commissioners as they would be to the Polytechnic Authorities. So soon as the Commissioners had the offer of the site they ordered designs to be prepared for a complete set of Baths and Washhouses, preserving the existing swimming bath as a cheap second-class bath, and adding a first-class swimming bath for men, an extra swimming bath for women, a number of private baths for men and women, a Turkish bath, and accommodation for, at least, 10 washers, with space for increasing the number of washers. The instructions provided that regard should be had to the requirements of the London County Council as to exits, Ax., in case it should be desired to let the large swimming bath for purposes of public entertainments or otherwise. A design was prepared by Mr. Tiltman, of the alterations, the Cost of which was estimated at £14,500, by which the following accommodation would be given, viz.:— Present Swimming Bath, as Second Class 150 feet by 55 feet Dressing Boxes, ground floor in number Open Dressing Boies in Gallery, reserved for boys' schools 100 in number New Men's First Class Swimming Bath 80 feet by 35 feet Dressing Boxes for same 47 in number New Women's Swimming Bath 50 feet by 40 feet Dressing Boxes for same 30 in number Men's First Class Slipper Baths 10 in number Men's Second Class Slipper Baths 10 in number Women's Second Class Slipper Baths 5 in number Women's First Class Slipper Baths 5 in number Turkish Bath Washhouse for 10 Washers and 10 Drying Closets. c 2 36 The purchase of the site (£8000) being added to Mr. Tiltman's estimate of £14,000, will give a total of £22,500. If to this be added the architect's commission of 5 per cent., and the expenses of the purchase and other incidental charges, the gross amount will still not exceed £25,000, and if to this sum be added £5000 to allow for alterations and possible improvements of the design, and as a margin for the builder's tenders exceeding Mr. Tiltman's estimate, the amount, altogether, will not exceed £30,000. Should this sum be borrowed for, say, 30 years, at 3! percent, interest, the yearly repayment during the first year would be, principal £1000 and interest £1050, together £2050, gradually reducing by £35 a year as each yearly sum of £1000 is paid of! the principal. The amount would be still less if the money were borrowed on the annuity principle, viz., that of repaying principal and interest by one equal amount throughout the whole period, the yearly payment would then probably be about £1500 throughout the whole thirty years. Should the loan be only sanctioned for only twenty years, the first yearly payment would be £1500 for principal and £1050 for interest, together £2550; and if on the annuity principle, about £2000 only. A rate of one half-penny in the £ produces at least £3000 a year, so that a rate of that amount would be amply sufficient to discharge the entire repayment of the debt, whether the amount were borrowed for thirty or twenty years, and leave something towards management expenses, even on the assumption that the baths and washhouses, when opened, only paid the weekly working expenses, and yielded no surplus towards discharging the annual instalments of principal and interest. The Commissioners do not lose sight of the fact that Washhouses and Baths may be more urgently needed in the northern part of the Parish than in the Ferndale Road district, but as the Commissioners do not possess the necessary powers to compcl owners to part with sites for Baths and Washhouses, the Commissioners can only acquire such sites as may be obtainable at reasonable prices. From the lessening quantity of open spaces 37 in Lambeth, it will become year by year more difficult to obtain so large a site as is required for Baths and Washhouses. The Commissioners strongly urge upon the Vestry the importance of securing the present site containing as it does an area of upwards of an acre and an erected Swimming Bath in working order needing little structural repair or alteration. The site is almost in the centre of the Parish where it is broadest and in a situation which will serve the important Wards of Brixton and Stockwell and at least the northern part of Norwood Ward. On this subject it is important to call attention to the fact that while the population in the aggregate Wards of North and South Marsh, Bishop's and Prince's was, in 1871, 99,573, it has only increased in 1881 to 103,997, whereas the population of the united Wards of Brixton and Stockwell which was, in 1871, 53,538 had increased in 1881 to 81,487, and the population in the Norwood Ward had increased between 1871 to 1881 from 15,369 to 24,145, so that the aggregate population of the three Wards of Brixton, Stockwell and Norwood 'had increased in the ten years from 68,907 to 105,632, a number slightly in excess of the four Inner Wards. The population of these three Wards will, no doubt, have further increased when the details of the Census of 1891 are published. Every year the houses in the Outer Wards become more and more crowded and occupied by two or more families, rendering Washhouses more needed, as families occupying rooms, or only parts of a house, can have little accommodation for washing. Houses let to more than one family arc daily becoming the rule and not the exception in the Outer Wards of the Parish. By the agreement entered into with the owners of the Ferndale Road site, the Commissioners have to complete, or pay interest on the purchase money from the expiration of one week from the approval of the Agreement by the Vestry, and the Commissioners have had great difficulty in inducing the vendors to keep the matter open so long. The Commissioners ask the Vestry— 1. To approve the Agreement. 38 2. To give the necessary permission to the Commissioners to borrow the sum of £8000 to defray the purchase money, such sum to be borrowed for the longest period allowed by the Local Government Board, either on the annuity principle or otherwise, as the Commissioners and the Local Government Board may decide, the rate of interest not to exceed 3' per cent, per annum; the amount so borrowed will be a charge on the Poor Bate. This Report was adopted by the Vestry on the 17th November, 1892. The Vestry approved the Agreement made by the Commissioners with the owners of the Ferndale Road site and buildings, and gave the necessary permission to the Commissioners to borrow the sum of £8000 to defray the purchase money, such sum to be borrowed for the longest period allowed by the Local Government Board, either on the annuity principle or otherwise, as the Commissioners and the Local Government Board may decide, the rate of interest not to exceed 3½ per cent, per annum ; the amount so borrowed to be a charge on the Poor Hate. FERNDALE ROAD BRIDGE. In May, 1890, the Vestry resolved to construct a Foot Bridge over the London, Chatham & Dover Railway, between Hubert Grove and Torrens Street for the convenience of the large neighbourhoods, on each side of the Railway, lying between Bedford Road and Ferndale Road. The Railway Company having granted the necessary permission for a public way over their line, Tenders were invited for the construction of the Bridge, and on 29th September, 1891, the Tender of Mess s. M. T. Shaw & Co. was accepted in the sum of £1295. On the 18th November, 1892, the Bridge was opened to the public. In consequence, however, of objections which were made by the owners of the houses in Torrens Street, it was found necessary to alter the construction of the staircase on the south side. This alteration, which was approved by the Vestry on 26th January 1893, at an estimated cost of £130, will shortly be completed. 39 THE UNEMPLOYED. Since the winter of 1887 the Vestry has instituted a Register of the names, addresses, and previous occupations of such residents in the Parish as might desire to be registered with the view of obtaining employment. In order that this Register might become more extensively availed of, at the commencement of the winter of 1892-93, handbills were exhibited in various parts of the Parish intimating that such a Register had been opened at the Vestry Hall. In the result, the names of 1877 men were registered, of whom 1550 accepted such employment as the Vestry were enabled to offer, and which consisted in scavengering and cleansing the streets. The Surveyor was authorised to employ as many men (not being less than 100) at 6d. per hour as could be usefully engaged, half ^ of that number to be employed 3 days in each week, the other half to be employed during the remaining 3 days in each week. In all 4812 days' work was given at an expenditure of £902 17s. COMPOUNDED PROPERTY. The allowance made to Owners of properties compounding for the payment of Rates, arc— (1) For small tenements rated at £15 and under, 25 per cent. (2) For tenement dwellings in Peabody and similar buildings rated at £20 and under, 10 per cent. The amount at which the sum allowed worked out on the total Rates for the year ending the 25th March, 1893, was 1.39 per cent The total sum allowed to compounders for the year was £5944 4s. 7d.

THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the Year 1892 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. In pursuance of the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 and 26 Vict.. Cap. 102, Sec. 43,1 herewith lay before Your Vestry a Report for the year 1892, upon the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. The population of the Parish of Lambeth, estimated Population. in the month of June 1892 represented by 277,564 persons. The calculation is based on the ratio of increase observed in the period of ten years intervening between the last census and the preceding one. The annual increment thus determined is 0.85 per cent. Comparing this estimate with the result of a calculation based on the number of inhabited houses, there is no material difference in the figures. 4 The Census returns show that the growth of the Population population during the inter-census years was not of Sub* districts. uniform. The ratio in some districts is greater than in others. In some there is an actual decline. The boundary line which separates the inner wards from the outer divides the growing from the declining populations. The four sub-districts on the south of this line show a marked increase in population. The four sub-districts on the north show a marked decrease. This peculiarity having respect to geographical position must be observed in estimating the population of each of the registration sub-districts for statistical purposes. The following table represents the approximate populations of the registration sub-districts:— Inner Sub-Districts— 1881 1891 1892 Waterloo Road, 1st 15,191 14,031 14,031 Waterloo Road, 2nd 16,351 14,644 14,644 Lambeth Church, 1st 19 876 18,024 18,024 Lambeth Church, 2nd 39,859 39.147 39,147 Outer Sub-Districts — Kennington, 1st 45,232 50,586 51,216 Kennington, 2nd 35.332 39.708 40,205 Brixton 62,837 73.405 74,311 Norwood 19,017 25.657 25,986 During the decennial period to which reference is made, agencies were at work which have ceased to exercise an influence upon the populations of the inner districts. The South Western Railway Company had purchased and demolished a considerable number of habitable houses, covering the site of their new roads and premises. Of the residents thus disturbed only a small section were housed in the immediate neighbourhood. The remainder were obliged to find accommodation elsewhere. The stricter enforcement of the regulation having reference to overcrowding has also had the effect of reducing the number of occupiers, and has led to a further decline in the population of these districts. In framing the above table it has been thought advisable, for the purposes of Statisticue enquiry, to retain in respect of the Inner Districts the figures of 1891. 5 Influenza Two diseases during the year occupied a large share Of public attention ; the one being Influenza, and the other Cholera. From Influenza, as a primary cause of death, 142 cases arc reported Hut Influenza is not so fatal when attacking a healthy subject as when occurring as a complication in the course of other diseases, and especially when these are of a chronic character. The mortality from Bronchitis in persons of advanced age is large, and it may fairly be inferred that death was accelerated in many eases by the unsuspected presence of Influenza. The full effect that Influenza exerts as a cause of sickness and death can .n no measure be estimated from the returns. A disease that makes large inroads on vital energy and physical strength affecting a considerable proportion of the population does not pass over without leaving a trail behind it. What direct influence this thrice recurring epidemic has had on the death rate beyond the comparatively small number of cases recorded under its especial denomination cannot be traced. Question have been as to what action Sanitary Authorities should take upon the approach or ourbreak of Influenza, and on this subject the following report was submitted to the Vestry on February nth. From the persistence of the epidemic of Influenza in Lambeth, in common with the other parishes of the Metropolis, a question of considerable importance arises in relation to the action, if any, which a Sanitary Authority should take in putting into operation the powers vested in it, having regard to the suppression or limitation of disease. Such powers have reference chiefly to notification, isolation, and disinfection. As to whether or no the resources of the • Vestry may be usefully and efficiently employed in any attempt to arrest the course of the epidemic of Infleunza must in a large measure depend on the nature and mode of distribution of the infecting material of that disorder. A few weeks ago Professor Pfeiffer, a German scientist, discovered in the expectoration of persons suffering from Influenza the microscopic organism commonly described by the name of 6 bacillus. This bacillus or microbe exhibits features characteristic and peculiar to itself, and differing from those of all other organisms yet recognised. Cultivation and inoculation experiments prove that its introduction into the circulation of animals results in the appearance of severe symptoms accompanied by fever. These researches of Pfeiffer have been confirmed by other eminent scientists. As an immediate consequence of this discovery, we arc placed in possession of exact knowledge in regard to the causal agent of influenza. We are in a position to know that the symptoms we recognise as constituting an attack of Influenza result from the presence in the human body of a microscopic organism, and that the disorder is propagated by its transference from one individual to another. That the disease is in fact zymotic. From the experiments of this scientist we also learn that the breath and expectoration are the chief media through which infection is conveyed. Moreover, from a consideration of the latter fact we may with confidence infer—and experience justifies the view—that persons suffering from catarrhal symptoms, accompanied by much cough and expectoration, are highly infectious. Whilst in the absence of catarrhal symptoms infection is little to be feared, even from those who are the subject of a severe attack. It has been observed, in the history of the recent epidemics, that during the invasion period, infection follows the lines of trade and traffic, and its extension is dependent on the operations of human intercourse. The disease is not aerial in the common acception of that term, but contagious. It does not resemble malaria, which may be contracted in isolated places, but it is of the same order as measles and whooping cough, that spread when people are in contact. These are some of the salient facts in connection with the infectiousness of influenza. Other considerations, however, have a close bearing upon the subject. During the prevalence of influenza, a large proportion of the persons affected exhibit symptoms little differing in character and severity from the manifestations of an ordinary cold. In the first stage of the complaint, now recognised 7 as the most infectious stage, and indeed throughout its course, there arc many who do not even suffer pain or inconvrnicnce. 'I hey follow the tenor of their ordinary occupations. They travel in the public conveyances and visit the places of public amusement They arc found in the class-rooms of schools, in the playground, in the shops, and in the streets. It is by these persons who apparently have little or nothing the matter with them, that the disease is chiefly propagated; and it is in consequence of the unrestrained movement of these that the epidemic attains such large proportions. The organised efforts of a Sanitary Authority are powerless in dealing with this section of infected persons by reason of their multitude, and the shadowy character of their ailment. It it true, those who arc more severely affected may be subjected to notification, isolation, and disinfection. But any success which might result from such action must be in a great measure neutralized through the dissemination of iufection by that larger section with whose movements the Vestry has no ability to interfere. There is no course the Vestry can be recommended to lake which holds out any reasonable hope of effectual interference with the course of the epidemic. In such periods as this through which we are now parsing, there is often manifest a general feeling of apprehension and alarm resulting from ignorance of the true facts and circumstances of the situation, and it is a matter of observation that efforts which have for their object the enlightenment of the people tend towards the allayment of panic and extravagant fear. Unfortunately a theory is entertained by a large number that free indulgence in stimulating liquor is advantageous in the prevention of attack, and when the disease is already acquired, in allaying the severity of the symptoms. A society of ladies, imbued with these mischievous views, has lately been engaged in distributing large quantities of whiskey and brandy among the poor. I beg to recommend—if such action be in accordance with the views of your Committee— that a short statement, having reference to the nature of the 8 disease and the mode of its propagation, together with some hints as to its rational treatment and its prevention, be prepared and circulated. On August 29th, in consequence of the extensive Cholera. outbreak of Cholera reported from Hamburg and other Continental towns, and of letters which had been addressed to the Vestry by the Local Government Hoard and Metropolitan Asylums Board, a special meeting of the Sanitary Committee took place, with a view of making any arrangements which might be considered necessary for the prevention of an outbreak, and for the limitation of the disease in The event of its appearance. A report on the nature of Cholera, its prevention, and the methods which might be adopted in the event of a visitation was made by the Medical Officer, and in the follow ing terms:— The group of symptoms affecting the human body, and characterised by the name of Asiatic Cholera, are produced by the presence in the alimentary canal of a microscopic organism, bearing a resemblance, when under cultivation outside the body, to the ordinary "comma" employed by printers in the punctuation of letterpress. This microbe has the power common to most of the low er forms of vegetable life, of exceedingly rapid reproduction. When deposited in a suitable soil and when the climateric conditions are favourable to its development, it generates with the celerity of the yeast plant. The microbe is capable of diffusing itself through large volumes of liquid or semi-liquid material in a compass of time which may almost be measured by minutes. The soil most favourable to its growth and dissemination is animal or vegetable matter undergoing the processes of decay. Moist warmth, which invariably accompanies chemical change in organic matter, especially observable in badly ventilated drains and sewers, fosters and encourages its development. The vitality of the microbe is displayed and its activity exerted in organic filth whenever it gains access thereto, whether in the domestic dust heap, the manure receptacle, the unswept court-yard, or the uncleaned cistern. 9 It must he remembered that Cholera is not an infectious disease usmg the tern. Hi commonly accepted sense. In this respect it is unlike Typhus. Scarlet Fever. Smallpox, or Measles. Even a susceptable pw. may pass a day and night in the sick room with a patient undergoing the suffering that accompanies the successive stage, of an attack of Cholera with confidence and safety, provided that the simple rules of cleanliness in nursing arc rigidly observed. It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that Cholera is capable of diffusing itself through a population with a degree of rapidity almost unequalled in the epidemic of anv other disease, And at the same? moment to declare that it is the least infectious of the infectious diseases. Vet such is undoubtedly the case, and herein lies the explanation. Cholera, in the temperate regions of the earth rarely infects through the medium of the atmosphere. Infection is thrown off in the discharges. The vomited matter and the diarrheal secretions are loaded with microbes. When these are destroyed the infective material is destroyed with them. But should the nursing not be conducted with attention, having regard to all the details of cleanliness, a condition of extreme danger to those surrounding the patient arises. Discharges, always copious in serious cases, dry and become encrusted on the nightdress, the sheets, or the bedding. The dust of the dessicated discbarge floats in the atmosphere. The carelessness of the attendant brings about its own retribution. The rapid and far-reaching extension of an epidemic of Cholera is not due to the direct conveyance of infection from one person to another. The processes of infection are indirect. Many are btricken at the satno moment and from the same cause. Polluted water, or contunin.Ued food, is the means by which infection is propagated. It must be remembered that Cholera proceeds from Cholera, and from nothing else. Oaks grow from acorns, and wheat from wheat; and Cholera arises from the dissemination of the special germ of Cholera. C holera will not make its appearance in London unless introduced into London. The air cannot bring it, 10 neither can it spring up of itself. Should a number of persons arrive in London from a, Cholera infected place, and sicken at home with the disease they have acquired abroad, even then no danger need be apprehended of a general epidemic. Poisoning of the water and food supplies on a large scale can alone have the effect of influencing any extensive outbreak. The following rules should be rigidly observed: 1. Water used for drinking purposes, and Milk should be boiled. 2. The Cistern should be often cleansed and furnished with a well fitting cover. Drinking water should be drawn from a tap attached direct to the main. 3. Meat, Vegetables and Fruit should be well cooked. 4. The Larder should be well ventilated, and free from any effluvia. 5. The contents of the Dust-bin should be disinfected periodically, and no large accumulation permitted. 6. The Drain should be flushed daily with a plentiful supply of water. 7. Rainwater, Sink, and Waste Pipes must be disconnected from the Drain, and be made to discharge their contents over properly trapped inlets. 8. Any smell occurring without assignable cause, whether observed continuously or with intermissions, or the presence of rats in the house should lead to the suspicion of the existence of a faulty drain. Unless Cholera obtain a foothold in other districts of the Metropolis more open to attack, the appearance of even isolated cases in Lambeth is a contingency which may be regarded as remote. Between Lambeth and the Cholera infected areas of the Continent there is no direct communication. Lambeth is not the resting place of foreign immigrants, neither is it a field from which dock labour is drawn. The Port of London is more distant 11 from Hamburg than the Port of Hull. And at the Ports both of London and Hull a strict supervision is exercised over suspected passengers and goods. The Harbour authorities are fully equipped for the efficient maintenance of the first lines of defence. Lambeth is thus outside the region in which alarm or even anxiety need with any show of reason be felt. Yet as a means of insurance against the possibilities of secondary infection, should the introduction of Cholera occur, there are certain steps which I submit should be taken. These relate in the first place to the adoption of the most perfect methods of sanitation, and secondarily to arrangements made with the object of securing the prompt and efficient isolation of infected person. I he methods of sanitation include:— (a) The removal of accumulations of filth from houses and their appurtenances; from streets and other public places; and the cleansing of courts and alleys. (B) The flushing of public sewers and roadside gullies; the reconstruction of leaking and improperly laid house drains, and the improvement of defective traps; the periodical scouring of house drains and yard gullies with a plentiful supply of water. (c) The cleansing of cisterns and tanks used for the storage of drinking water; the maintenance of a strict supervision over dairies, cowhouses, slaughterhouses, and of all places used for the storage of food. (a) Districts of the Parish where houses are closely aggregated together, including the smaller streets and courts and alleys, demand the special attention of your Committee. For usually in these densely populated places are found lodging houses and tenement houses, occupied by members of the poorest and consequently the most helpless section of the people; the poverty of some of the tenants leading to overcrowding, the depravity of others to the reckless abuse of all sanitary appliances. These streets, I submit, should be subjected to a systematic course of 12 house to house inspection. The houses, when dirty,should be cleansed. The walls of the courts, yards, areas, passages, and alleys should be limewashed. The pavement, where defective, should be repaired, and the pavement and yard gullies scoured and flushed with an abundant supply of water. Moreover, accumulations of dust, or other filthy material not usually coming under that designation, should be removed by the Parish scavengers. It is desirable that the removal of dust should take place throughout the Parish at more frequent intervals. In the densely populated districts it is imperative that it should be removed not less frequently than twice a week. It is also desirable that the courts, alleys, passages, and less frequented streets, as well as the main arteries of traffic, should receive the daily attention of the Parish sweeper. I would also submit that periodical inspection be made of all places where manure is collected or stored : at cowhouses, stableyards. and mews, and the frequent removal of accumulations should be strictly enforced. That the dust yards be visited daily, in order that legal action may be immediately taken upon the observance of any carelessness or neglect on the part of the contractor or person in charge. (b) House drains laid in accordance with methods of construction commonly in favour a few years ago are seldom sufficiently sound to withstand the tests usually employed. The faults, when such are found, frequently consist in imperfect connexions between the pipes, admitting of the escape of sewer gas. At the time drains of this class were laid it was not considered necessary to envelope the pipes in a bed of concrete. Methods of interception, now universally practised, had not been discovered. As the greater number of London houses were built at a period before the sanitary authorities exercised strict supervision over the construction of house drains, it is not a matter of surprise that the drains in a large per centage of houses in every parish are in a faulty state. Although much has been done in Lambeth to alter this undesirable condition, there is yet much that remains to be done. It 13 will be gathered from the remarks already made on The nature of Cholera, that the sewers of a district may become charged with the virus. It will also be observed that one of the first methods of prevention, having regard to the extension of Cholera, is the improvement of house drainage. I submit that a house to house inspection in selected districts, undertaken with the object of detecting faulty drainage and providing a remedy, must be followed by the most beneficial results. Whilst making this recommendation, I would also suggest that the road gullies and the public sewers of the parish should, as far as possible, be subjected to a course of cleansing, and flushing with an abundant supply of water. (c) The water, the milk, and the food supplies are subjects to which attention should be directed. The imperfections of the existing water supply, resulting from the polluted condition of the river in that part of its course from which the companies draw their supply, is a subject with which your Committee has no power to deal. Hut its fouling in cisterns after it has left the companies' service pipes may be prevented by strict supervision; and in this matter your Committee has a direct responsibility conferred upon it by the Public Health Act, 1891. I submit the recommendation that a systematic examination be made into the condition of the cisterns of the parish; that cleansing, when required, should be enforced; that proper covers, where necessary, should be provided; that faults of position should be remedied; and that standing waste pipes, or other direct communications with the drain, should be abolished. In regard to the milk and the food supplies, it is desirable that inquiry be made by the inspectors as to the position of the larder in houses, with a view of ascertaining whether or not the food is in danger of becoming affected by reason of the contiguity of the dust receptacle or the closet, or from the existence of a communication with the drain by sink or gulley not disconnected or properly trapped, whereby access might be furnished for the admission of sewer gas into the larder. An inspection should be 24 made of Dairies, Bakehouses, Slaughterhouses, Cowhouses. Butchers' shops, Greengrocers, Poulterers, and Fishmongers; and it should be observed that the drainage and water supply and other sanitary arrangements of such premises arc in good order and condition,—that the food exposed for sale is sound, and that proper means are taken for the storage and removal of trade refuse and offal. It is a matter of considerable importance that the sanitary arrangements of Schools should be in excellent order. Inspections made at the Hoard Schools of the Parish reveal a somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs in some instances. Certain Schools are furnished with the old pattern iron tank receivers with hand flushing apparatus. Receivers constructed of this material are subject to incrustations, especially when permitted to fall into rust, such incrustations are exceedingly offensive and rapidly re-form after removal—the rough surfaces of the tank favouring deposits of this character. The fouling of these tanks and the absence of an automatic flushing apparatus render them unfitted for the purposes they serve. This matter has been the subject of representation to the School Board, but such representation has only resulted in some increased vigilance on the part of the Caretaker' but no lasting improvement has been effected. I submit that the time has arrived when action should be taken with a view of enforcing this very necessary improvement. Thus far I have spoken only of precautionary measures which may be taken to prevent Cholera from obtaining a foothold in the Parish. I will now pass on to the second consideration, namely, The measures which may be adopted with a view of limiting the extension of Cholera, should an epidemic occur. These measures have reference (a) To the isolation of infected persons, whether at their own homes or at some other place especially set aside for their reception and accommodation. (b) The means of their removal to such place. 15 (c) Their nursing and medical attendance during the course of the disease. Isolation op Infected Persons. (a) Isolation at Home.—Whatever provision may ultimately be made in regard to the disposal of persons suffering from Cholera in the event of an Epidemic of that disease breaking out in Lambeth, it will be found necessary to make arrangements applicable to persons remaining under treatment at home. The formidable nature of the disease, its rapid development and the severity of its symptoms, resulting often in a condition of collapse within a few hours after its first appearance, render the removal of the patient often a task of difficulty not unaccompanied by danger. More especially is this the case when the operation is undertaken in the later stages of the complaint. However complete your arrangements may be in regard to Hospital accommodation, a large percentage of the cases occurring will, as a result of this peculiarity in the couse of the symptoms, pass through the various stages of the disease in the place of its onset. It is therefore a matter of the first importance that measures be taken to obtain, as far as circumstances admit, a method of complete isolation in the ordinary dwelling house, and to consider what provision may be necessary for the nursing and medical attendance of persons so situated. I would submit that you will find it expedient to cause the immediate medical examination of the occupants of such a dwelling, and the separation of the affected from the unaffected. And, further, among those regarded as the unaffected will generally be found some complaining of symptoms which, although not of sufficient severity to justify a definite classification, yet suggestive of a condition which might well be looked upon with suspicion, rendering them unlit for cohabitation with the healthy. These constitute a third class. the affected persons, especially if the symptoms be severe, must remain in the house in which they are attacked, with a person in charge. A trained nurse is the most desirable Attendant. If the epidemic be limited in extent, one may be secured from a Sisterhood, or institution of nurses. 16 Failing these, a member of the patient's family, or other occupant, may be found willing to undertake the charge. It would also be necessary, in the event of an outbreak, for your Committee to secure the services of a medical practitioner to attend infected persons who are unable to make provision in this matter for themselves. The efficient ventilation of the premises, the disinfection, the removal of sanitary defects, and the arrangements for the immediate removal of the dead, are matters which would engage the attention of your staff of inspectors. Isolation at Hospital—It is also necessary to consider the desirability of making arrangements for the reception of patients at a place provided especially for their accommodation and treatment. Isolation can be better effected and treatment more successfully conducted at a public institution than in the scattered households of the people. The Metropolitan Asylums Board is the authority upon which your vestry in the ordinary course would rely for due provision. But the hands of the managers are full. The epidemic of Scarlet Fever, which has spread with unusual rapidity over the Metropolis, is taxing the strength of the Board to the utmost. All the beds at the Fever Hospitals are occupied. As the climax of the Scarlet Fever epidemic, if it follow precedent, will not be reached until the first or second week in October, it is evident that the managers are not in a position to make any provision for the reception of Cholera patients. Enquiries have been made at St. Thomas's Hospital, and also at the Lambeth Infirmary, with a view of ascertaining what, if any, facilities would be given for the reception of Cholera cases. The question is under the consideration of the Governors of the Hospital and the Board of Guardians. From an unofficial conversation I have had with the resident medical officer of St. Thomas's, I learn that accommodation might, if necessary, be immediately afforded for 30 cases. I also learn that it is the intention of the Board of Guardians to place at the disposal of the Sanitary Authority, for the purpose of the reception of Cholera cases, the workhouse buildings situated in Princes Road. Little 17 doubt need be entertained that this provision will be available in case of need. It may be confidently expected that the accommodate, placed at your disposal by the Guardians and Hospital Authorities is sufficiently extensive to meet any immediate contingency. Any further demands which may be made upon your Committee for accommodation, whether for the isolation of Cholera patients, doubtful cases, or for healthy persons who had been exposed to' infection from living under the same roof with those who are the subjects of attack, may be provided for when they arise by the erection of temporary structures. Since by the erection of Corrugated Iron Buildings, accommodation for an almost unlimited number of persons, may be furnished within a space of time covered by twenty-four to thirty-six hours: and since a plot of ground, which if occasion require, can be utilized as a site for Isolation and Hospital Sheds, is already in the possession of the Vestry, your Committee may feel confident that, in the unexpected event of the Parish of Lambeth becoming the scene of a visitation of Cholera, your Committee would be in a position to make complete and ample provision for any contingency that might arise. In conclusion, I would submit to your Committee the desirability of engaging the services of six additional Inspectors, to temporarily assist the Sanitary Staff in carrying out the recommendations of this report. Every man so engaged should be in possession of a Certificate of Qualification from the Sanitary Institute. In accordance with recommendations of the last paragraph of this Report, six additional Inspectors were appointed. The wages were fixed at two pounds ten shillings per week, and the men appointed each possessed a certificate of competance, issued by the Sanitary Institute. The arrangement was temporary, and terminable at any time by seven days' notice. The additional staff commenced work on September 1st, and continued office, with one exception, until December 3rd. Work of an effective and a beneficial character was done during this period. B 18 The shops of Fruiterers, Greengrocers, Butchers, Poulterers, and Pork and Sausage vendors were placed under special supervision, and the cleanliness and good appointment of Dairies, Bakehouses, Slaughterhouses and Cowhouses were secured by frequent inspction. The distribution of a circular warning the vendors of food against the risk of prosecution in the event of the discovery of unwholesome articles upon their premises, and the visits of the additional Inspectors rendered any action at the Police Courts unnecessary except in a few cases. During this period the action of the Vestry's Officers was continued in an attempt to induce the authorities to reorganise the sanitary arrangements of the Board Schools. The drainage of several of these schools was not in a satisfactory condition, and the sanitary offices in many were provided with the old-fashioned metal tanks which were with difficulty maintained in a cleanly condition. Moreover, the regulations issued to Care-takers did not provide for the sufficient and frequent flushing of these appliances. Many representations had been made, including both requisitions to the Board itself and personal applications at the offices of the Works Committee. Notwithstanding the urgency of the subject of these communications the School Board failed to commence operations, and ultimately a summons was issued in respect of South Lambeth Road Schools. The work under requisition was carried out during the period of the adjournment of the Court, and consequently upon the day of hearing the prosecution was withdrawn, the School Board agreeing to pay the costs. At a later date a further summons was issued having reference to the insani tary condition of Johanna Street Schools. Several children in attendance had contracted diphtheria, and although no evidence presented itself, constituting proof that the insanitary condition which undoubtedly existed stood in a causal relation to the disease. Yet it was considered expedient that immediate action should be taken. The case was heard at the Southwark Police Court after an adjournment of one week, to allow of the necessary works being completed, and the Magistrate decided against the School Board, granting costs. Since this decision the sanitary arrangements of every Board School in Lambeth have been thoroughly overhauled and active progress has been made in introducing an improved system of drainage. 19 Although much alarm was created by the presence of Cholera on the Continent and within a few hours sail of the Port of London, only a few typical cases occurred in England, and one case alone of a undoubtable Asiatic type was introduced into Lambeth. As the nature of the disease in this case was fully investigated by the Physician at St. Thomas's, under whose care he was retained and the Pathologist of the Hospital, the following particulars relating to the history of the attack, and the means taken to prevent the spread the infection are of interest. On Monday, October 3rd, a letter was received from the Resident Physician of St. Thomas's Hospital, stating that on the previous morning, at an early hour, a person suffering from a complaint resembling Cholera, had been removed from a house situated in the Parish of Lambeth and admitted into the Hospital. On visiting the ward in which the patient was lying, and after observation of the symptoms and microscopical examination of the diarrhœl discharge, the Medical Officer was of opinion that most stringent precautions should be taken by disinfection and other available methods to prevent any extension in the Parish of that which he regarded as a dangerous infectious disease. The patient, Henry William Passfield, occupied the position of a captain in charge of a river tug plying between Woolwich and Becton, and his business consisted in loading, unloading, and towing from place to place the cargoes of ships. Usually, his engagements prevented him from visiting home more frequently than at weekly intervals. On the evening of Friday, two days before his admission into the Hospital, he arrived home and complained of feeling unwell. Refusing food, he went to bed. On Saturday morning he left home for business. On Saturday evening at 9 o'clock he returned. At this time his symptoms were acute, his wife became alarmed and sought the advice of a local Medical practitioner, who visited and prescribed for the patient. The severity of his symptoms increasing, he was removed to St. Thorn . Hospital at one o'clock on Sunday morning. On the receipt of the first intimation, the residence of the B2 20 patient, 26, St. Oswald's Place, had been disinfected. To stamp out infection two things were necessary—1st, the disinfection or destruction of every article or material with which the patient was known to have been in contact during his short visit to his place of residence, and secondly, the complete isolation for a period of six days of the persons living in the infected house. Little difficulty was experienced in accomplishing the first object. The bedding, carpets, window blinds, and wearing apparel, indeed every article appertaining to the sleeping room, the first scene of Passfield's attack, were removed and destroyed. The floorcloth of the hall and kitchen and the mats were burnt. His body linen and the tub in which it lay were carried away and placed in the furnace. Quicklime was spread over the earth and stones in the yard where he had vomited. The closet that he had used was scoured and the drain charged with carbolic, and by the order of the Surveyor the sewer leading from the house was entered, cleansed, and disinfected. The paper was removed from the walls of the sleeping, the living rooms, and the passages of the house, and the ceilings of these and the walls of the yard were limewashed. The paintwork and the floors were scoured. The cistern was emptied and cleansed. It was evident when the work of destruction, cleansing, and disinfection were at an end. that infectious material introduced by the patient must have been rendered innocuous and swept away. The second object, namely, the isolation of the residents presented some difficulties. Two families occupied the house, each family consisting of father, mother and children, 13 persons in all; 12 since the removal of Passfield to the hospital. It became at once apparent that most of them must havo used the closet after the patient had visited that place whilst suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting, and in the interval between Saturday night when he was removed to the hospital, and Monday when the disinfection took place. It was possible that these people, or one of them, might be infected and capable of conveying infection. At all risks it was thought desirable to detain the occupiers of the 21 infected house under observation at home, and so prevent them from visiting with or being visited by other people. But no law exists enabling the Vestry to interfere with the liberty of action of people even where a suspicion of actual infectious disease is entertained, much less might the movements of these be restrained when future possibilities were alone under consideration. Their consent, however, to voluntarily submit themselves to isolation for the specified period might be secured by an offer of compensation. An arrangement was entered into with this object in view, and watchmen were appointed between the hours of 6 a.m. and 12 p.m to observe that the terms of the agreement were being carried into effect. The Sub-Committee, having heard the Report of the Medical officer, resolved that the action of the Medical Officer be approved, that he be authorised to adopt such measures as he may think necessary for the complete isolation of the inmates of 26, St. Oswald's Place, and other cases which may arise in connection with the present outbreak. List of Expenses incurred in Compensation, having reference to the destruction of Goods and the Isolation of the Inmates: For replacement of Bedding, &c. £8 5 7 Wearing Apparel and Miscellaneous Goods 10 0 0 Compensation in lieu of Wages and in consideration of voluntary submission to Isolation 5 0 0 Maintenance and Incidental Expenses 4 0 7 Wages of Watchmen 2 0 0 £29 6 2 The death of the patient took place at St. Thomas's Hospital on October 7th, and the body of the deceased was laid in the Hospital Mortuary until the time of the funeral. The period of isolation came to a close on the evening of Friday, October 7th, and as no disease presenting symptoms resembling those exhibited by the patient had made its appearance either among the isolated families or in the vicinity of the infected house up to that time, the outbreak was regarded as at an end. 22 THE BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered in Lambeth during the year 1892, reaches a total of 9226 cases, 129 more than the number registered in the previous year. The registered number of male children exceeds by 278 that of the female. During the same period in the entire Metropolitan area 131,535 births are recorded: 67,021 males and 64,514 females. The table shows the number of births registered in each year for the last ten years: Year. No. of Births. Year.

The deaths from all causes, registered in Lambeth during the year 1892 were 5793, of these 2967 were males,and 2826 females. This number includes the deaths of 651 persons who had been removed to the Hospital situate in Lambeth, but who had previously lived in other parishes of the Metropolis; on the other hand, 314 parishioners died in the outlying institutions in the Metropolis. Having deducted the former and added the latter, the number ot deaths proper to Lambeth is 5457, representing a death rate of 19.6 per 1000 persons living. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 20.6 per 1000. In the Metropolis the registered deaths numbered 87,749, of these 44,541 were males, and 43,208 were females. The death rate in the five great groups of districts is as follows:- South Districts 19.3 West Districts 19.l Central Districts 25.1 North Districts 19.2 East Districts 23.6 26 The following table shows the mortality, male and female, including strangers, in the different districts, and a comparison of the number of deaths in each quarter.

The lists of mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases include 685 parishioners and 178 strangers, being an increase of 73 upon last year's figures. Deducting the number of the strangers and adding the number of the deaths of parishioners who died in the outlying institutions, the total number of Zymotic deaths proper to Lambeth is 715. This represents a Zymotic death rate of 25 per 1000, the Metropolitan rate for the same period being 2.8 per 1000. During the year 1892, under the Notification Clauses of the Public Health Act, 3027 cases of infectious disease have been reported. Of this number 1021 were removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board, and 2006 remained under medical treatment at their own homes. In accordance with the resolution of the Vestry, a Sanitary Inspection was made and the drain test applied in every infected house. The infected houses numbered 2430, two or more cases occasionally occurring under the same roof. The sanitary defects discovered are grouped under two headings; under the first is found a list of such defects as are referable to the condition of traps, fittings, and appliances. The second has special reference to the drains lying underground and to the soil pipes. 1474 houses are reported as subject to nuisances arising from defects classed under one or both headings. In 720 houses faults in connection with the drains permitted the escape of sewage or sewer gas. But in all defects were observed in the traps, fittings, and appliances. The existence of Scarlet Fever was notified in 1435 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 925. Diptheria made its appearance in 394 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 256. Typhoid Fever caused an examination to be made in 98 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 53. Erysipelas invaded 363 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 183. Continued Fever was 41 reported as present in 30 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 12. Croup claimed 47 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 20. Small Pox infected 20 houses, and sanitary defects were dicovered in8. In 20 houses Puerperal Fever complicated the lying period of childbirth, and sanitary defects were discovered in 7. Diarrhœa having been notified under the designation of Cholera attracted the attention of the Inspectors to 20 houses, 10 of which were the subjects of sanitary defects. Two houses were reported as being infected with Typhus, and 1 house with Asiatic Cholera. In the following table the Zymotic death rate is compared in the different districts of the Parish, both for the whole year and each quarter of the year, cases of deaths of non-Parishioners are deducted.
