No cases of Poliomyelitis, Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Leptospirosis, Malaria, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Paratyphoid Fever, Plague, Relapsing Fever, Smallpox, Tetanus, Typhoid Fever, Typhus or Yellow Fever were notified during the year although surveillance was necessary in some cases where holiday-makers and travellers returned to this country from areas where certain of these diseases were endemic. The following table shows the number of specimens submitted to the Department of Pathology at Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, and once again my thanks are due to Dr E.Atkinson, Consultant 12 Pathologist and his staff for their co-operation and assistance in this connection:- SPECIMENS SUBMITTED TO THE PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT -OLDCHURCH HOSPITAL - Taken from Total Number of Persons Swabbed T ota I Number of swabs taken Negative Positive Shigella Sonnei Salmonella Food Handlers 16 22 22 — — Non-Food Handlers 140 172 158 6 *8 Paratyphoid contacts 5 5 5 Typhoid contacts 7 7 7 — — * Salmonella Typhimurium 5 Enieriditis 1 Brandenburg 1 Unidentified 1 T uberculosis A table giving details of new cases of tuberculosis notified during the year is given overleaf.

The Havering Council provide the Association with an annual grant for this purpose, and the secretarial work of the Association is undertaken by the staff of the Health Department, Dr, S. Steel and Dr, E. Woolf, the Chest Physicians, act as medical advisers to the Association, and those members of the nursing staff of the Health Department involved in tuberculosis visiting also serve on the Committee of the Association, providing helpful information on those patients in need of assistance, Milk for Tuberculous Patients: One pint of milk per day is provided free of charge by the Council to patients suffering from tuberculosis where recommended by the Chest Physician, Eight new patients were recommended for a grant of milk during the year and the total number of patients who received milk during the year was 60, This was 14 a reduction of 12 compared with the previous year Medical Arrangements for Long Stay Immigrants During the year information was received from various Port Health Authorities in respect of 118 long stay immigrants who were stated to be proceeding to addresses in this Borough This is an increase of 28 on the previous year In 61 cases, successful contact was made and appropriate advice given on health matters, of the remainder 53 were coming to this country to work in local hospitals and in tljese cases no contact was made with them as their place of domicile was under the control of the Regional Hospital Board, The countries where the passports of these long stay immigrants were issued were as follows:- Commonwealth Caribbean — 33 India — 15 Pakistan — 1 Other Asian — 24 African — 28 Other — 9 Non-Commonwealth European — 7 Other — 1 TOTAL - 118 Smallpox Contacts Thirty-six overseas passengers — whose destination was an address in this Borough - were referred to the Department during the year and kept under surveillance for up to 14 days under the Public Health (Ships) (Aircraft) Regulations, 1970. These passengers had arrived at airports/ports in this country from a declared locally infected or endemic area and were not in possession of valid international certificates of vaccination against smallpox These were mostly cases where vaccination was contra-indicated because of age or other health grounds 15 Venereal Diseases Returns from the Treatment Centre at Oldchurch Hospital showed that new cases attending the Centre again increased but only slightly compared with the previous year. In 1971 the increase in the number of new cases compared with 1970 was 26%, but the relative figure for 1972 when compared with 1971 was 5.3%. Details of the number of new cases in 1972 are as follows:- Syphi I is - Primary and Secondary 4 — Others 1 Gonorrhoea 175 Other genital conditions 1105 Other conditions 639 1924 In 1971 there were 10newcases of syphilis, 179gonorrhoea and 1638 other conditions. 890 of the total of 1924 cases mentioned above resided in Havering. Returns received from other Treatment Centres in London showed that 227 Havering residents attended as new cases The total number of new cases from Havering included in the returns in 1972 was therefore 1117 as follows:- Syphilis — Primary and Secondary 3 — Other — Gonorrhoea 95 Other genital conditions 714 Other conditions 305 The 1971 total of 1097 included 4 syphilis, 109 gonorrhoea and 959 other conditions. In August 1972 a V.D. Telephone Answering Service was inaugurated inHavering to give a pre-recorded message regarding venereal diseases, together with details of the Treatment Centre at Oldchurch Hospital. In December, the Department of Health and Social Security inaugurated a telephone advice service on Venereal Diseases for the London area, which was also available at local call rates to Havering residents Whilst the number of calls received by the Havering service varied, it is quite apparent that regular advertising is necessary to keep the service constantly in use Any slackening of publicity quickly shows in the reduced number of telephone calls received. 16 Vaccination and Immunisation Progress was continued during 1972 with the immunisation schedule outlined in last year's report The percentage of children born in 1970 immunised by 31.12.72 (Last year's figures in brackets) Whooping cough 88% (80%) Diphtheria 91% (87%) Poliomyelitis 93% (90.4%) Tetanus 91% (88.0%) Measles 62% (64.4%) The figures for whooping cough, diphtheria, poliomyelitis and tetanus show a very satisfactory rise on those of last year and place us well above the national average for immunisation rates. As these diseases become less common it becomes even more important to stress to parents the need to protect their children in order to maintain the level of immunity in the community. These figures exemplify the excellent work by the Health Department staff in this vital preventive work. The immunisation rate for measles has remained almost static over the past year but the number of cases occurring in the community has continued to fall. 1970 1971 1972 Cases of Measles 977 580 392 B.C.G. The immunisation of school children during their second year at secondary school continued throughout the year, and a total of 2,952 children were skin tested and 2,534 were vaccinated against tuberculosis This is a fairly good acceptance rate, but the need for this vital immunisation before going out in to the adult world is not always appreciated by the children and their parents. The incidence of tuberculosis over the years has decreased very much but until the disease is completely eradicated, the need for immunisation is still vital, The campaign against rubella(german measles) has continued and 1,735 girls were immunised in 1972, During the year the 17 service was extended to female school teachers, initially in schools in the southern half of the Borough With adult rubella immunisation the degree of natural immunity is very high so that only teachers who are shown to be without natural protection by a preliminary blood test are given the vaccine, It is hoped to extend this facility to all schools and all new teachers entering the Borough during the next year. 18 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The personal health services have continued their gradual expansion throughout 1972 despite-very little increase in establishment The staff remaining with the Health Department have all made an extra effort as it has become increasingly difficult to recruit newstaffwith the uncertainty of impending change with the Re-organisation of the National Health Service in 1974 The greatest expansion has taken place in the field of family planning and cytology with the introduction of the service at more clinics and increased training of doctors and nurses in order to staff these clinics Another new development in 1972 was the establishment of a community psychiatric nursing service initially with two members of staff working in extremely close liaison with the local mental hospitals following up in theirownhomesandassisting in the maintenance of medication of patients once discharged from hospital This service is a development which goes in some way to meet a long felt need with the increasing emphasis on community care of mental illness In 1972 the development of the Community Nursing Service continued in spite of the shortage of staff The Mayston structure of management allowed communication within the section to run smoothly and enabled staff at all levels to participate in the formation of policy by discussion groups and staff meetings Liaison between the Local Authority services and the other branches of the National Health Service has continued through 1972 in the various ways mentioned in last year's report A noteable contribution to this co-operation was made by a magnificent displaydemonstrating community nursing services arranged by some of the staff on the occasion of the Romford Group Hospitals Open Day This closer liaison with hospitals has resulted in improved communication between ward sisters and the domiciliary nurses Exchange visits between ward sisters coming out into the community to spend a day with the district nurses and health visitors, and the district nurses spending a day in the hospital has resulted in a better understanding of the respective roles It is felt that this will have a beneficial effect on the service as a whole 19 Maternity Services The midwifery service has achieved a very close liaison with Rush Green Hospital and Harold Wood Hospital during the year A working party consisting of the senior nursing officers of both hospital and thecommunity nursing service meet regularly to consider and discuss ways in which the efficiency of the service can be maintained and even improved. There is continuing contact between the hospital and community midwives, which naturally arises from the patient being delivered in the general practitioner units of both hospitals by domiciliary midwives who accompany their patients into hospital for the delivery and continue to nurse them when they are discharged to their homes at 48 or 72 hours after the birth. Antenatal Care Statistics relating to this Authority's antenatal and postnatal clinics are given below:- Number of women attending clinics Antenatal Post-natal TOTAL 935 1 936 Doctor Midwife TOTAL Number of sessions 4 956 .. 960 Mothercraft and Relaxation Classes These classes continue to be well attended and provide an essential service to the mothers to be in this Borough The figures show a rise in attendance by mothers booked for hospital confinements as is shown in the following table:- Booked for hospital confinement Booked for home confinement TOTAL N umber of women attending 822 30 852 Midwifery At December 1972 18 full-time and 4 part-time midwives were in post, showing a continued reduction in posts since 1971 The position with regard to the availability of maternity beds in the maternity units within Havering continues to be very good and a hospital confinement is available for all mothers 20 The domiciliary midwives continued attending their mothers in the Rush Green General Practitioner Unit and in Harold Wood General Practitioner Maternity Unit The percentage of hospital births for 1972 was 95.0%, an increase of 5.7% over 1971 The number of domiciliary confinements decreased from 558 in 1970, 414 in 1971, to 172 in 1972. The number of patients delivered in hospital but discharged before the tenth day into care of the domiciliary midwife increased from 3249 to 3,266, added to which 277 babies were delivered by the domiciliary midwives in the hospital general practitioner units. This shows the continued trend for the domiciliary midwife to conduct less deliveries in the patient's home but to go with the mother into the hospital general practitioner unit, deliver her baby and return to care for the mother and child in their own home shortly afterwards This ensures the availability of the best conditions for the delivery but with the continuity of of care which is so essential, During the year 20 pupil midwives completed their second part district training under the direction of approved teaching midwives, In addition 24 students undertaking obstetric training at Rush Green Hospital spent a day with a domiciliary midwife accompanying heron hervisitsand attendingageneral practitioner antenatal clinic Family Planning The family planning services within the Borough were further extended during 1972 The service provided bytheCouncil was increased to 8 clinics within the Borough and the Family Planning Agency Scheme No 5 was implemented which entitled Havering residents to free consultation, advice and supplies when family planning was required for medical reasons, and free consultations in non-medical cases The F.P.A. continued to provide a full family planning service in their Romford premises provided for their use by Havering Council and the additional evening clinic in South Hornchurch has become quite a busy session A family planning clinicwas started in 1972 at Rush Green Maternity Unit This service for hospital patients is provided by the National Health Service but is staffed by a family planning trained doctor and nurse from our staff 21 Cervical Cytology This service continued a gradual expansion in 1972, when the service was available in all of the Council's clinics The number of smears taken during 1972 was 2,793 of which 5 cases required referral for hospital investigation but in a further 688 cases minor conditions were detected which either required treatment by their general practitioner or a repeat smear. 1972 continued the National Recall System of women who were tested when the Scheme first started—approximately 1891 repeat smears were taken Premature Births 228 premature births were notified during the year which compares with 207 in the previous year, and represents 6.5% of the total live births Havering is well served by two Special Baby Care Units under the care of Dr Nauth Misir, one at Harold Wood Maternity Hospital, the other at Rush Green Maternity Hospital. CHILD HEALTH SERVICES Congenital Malformations Details of congenital malformations observed at birth are required to be reported by the midwife on the notice giving the notification of the birth. Particulars of each are forwarded to the Registrar General who has an early warning system to notify Medical Officers of Health of any untoward rise in the number of notifications During 1972 59 babies were reported as suffering from congenital malformations, 84 different conditions being observed as set out in the following table:- Diagnostic Group Number 0 Central Nervous System 33 1 Eye and Ear 4 2 Alimentary System 8 3 Heart and Circulatory System 2 4 Respiratory System 1 5 Urino-genital System 6 6 Limbs 22 7 Other Musculoskeletal 2 8 Other Systems 6 9 Other Malformations – 22 Phenylketonuria The Guthrie test for detection of this rare metabolic disease in new born babies which untreated can lead to severe mental handicap continued in 1972, the laboratory service being provided for this test by the Neo-natal Screening Service of the Hospital for Sick Children Equivocal results have a repeat test and any positive result has immediate access to hospital treatment. Handicapped Pre-School Children At the end of 1972 241 handicapped pre-school children were under regular supervision by doctors, health visitors and educational psychologists with a view to the provision of special help when necessary and assessment for the most appropriate educational placement Clinics The various services provided at the main clinics and subclinics are as charted overleaf. Clinic Doctors The establishment of doctors has continued below maximum for most of the year, the service was depleted by the retirement in May of Dr M.E. Williams who had served this Borough for manyyears, in particular the Upminster area where she had given such devoted service The establishment was varied in the beginning of 1972 by the creation of three Senior Medical Officer posts from the existing Departmental Officer posts These Senior Medical Officers (CIi.nical) have retained their clinical duties but have developed additional interests, namely Occupational Health/ Health Education, Family Planning/Cytology and Child Health 23 MAIN CLINICS Collier Row Clinic Hulse Avenue, Collier Row GENERAL CLINIC SERVICES SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES Midwives Clinic Antenatal Relaxation Classes Family Planning Cervical Cytology Child Health Immunisation and Vaccination Chiropody Dental Medical Consultation and minor ailments Speech Therapy Ophthalmic Orthoptic Orthopaedic Physiotherapy √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Cranham Clinic Avon Road, Cranham √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Elm Park Clinic Abbs Cross Lane, Elm Park √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Harold Wood Clinic Gubbins Lane, Harold Wood √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Harold Hill Health Centre Gooshays Drive, Harold Hill √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Homchurch Clinic Westland Avenue, Hornchurch √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Rainham Clinic Upminster Road South, Rainham √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Romford Clinic Marks Road, Romford √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ South Homchurch Clinic South End Road, Rainham √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ Upminster Clinic St. Mary's Lane, Upminster √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ SUB-CLINICS Hilldene School Clinic Grange Road, Romford V Heaton Way United Reformed Church Chaucer Road.

the clinic nurses have taken part in the clinical sessions, Arrangements have been made for a peripatetic clinic nurse to be involved in the domiciliary family planning service next year Three students successfully completed their training and joined the staff as qualified health visitors Three students 25 commenced training in the Autumn Health education in schools and clinics continued to becarried out, but still could not receive as much attention as desirable due to shortage of staff and other priority demands on the health visitor's time Three more health visitors were delegated to work with groups of general practitioners instead of in geographical areas The volume of work in one practice that has had the service of a full-time health visitor for many years necessitated the delegation of a further health visitor A satisfactory liaison arrangement has been achieved between another group of general practitioners and a health visitor, which satisfied the needs forthe time being Preparations are in hand for further attachments to take place during the next year Students Considerable numbers of students have been accepted for observations, visits and practical work experience during the year Without the willing co-operation of the field staff in all sections of the Community Nursing Service and their nursing officers, this would not be possible The Fieldwork Instructors (Health Visiting) and the Practical Work Instructors (District Nursing) have been actively engaged in training programmes which have helped several members of the field staff in obtaining further professional qualifications Several members of staff have undertaken lectures to students both in hospital training schools and colleges Students — Observation Visits 1972 Student Nurses S.R.N. 58 Pupil Nurses S.E.N. 35 Special Baby Care Course Students 11 Student Nurses (Psychiatric) 17 Student Nursery Nurses 6 Miscellaneous 29 Speech Therapy There was no improvement in the staffing situation during the year and only two and a half posts from an establishment of 5 are filled 322 children were newly referred and 257 of the more urgent cases commenced treatment 26 At the end of the year 175 children were receiving speech therapy and a further 214 were being kept under observation 118 children were waiting for treatment to be commenced District Nursing Shortage of staff has prevented the district nursing service expanding to meet all the needs of the community, and 24 hour care is still not possible However, the needs of each patient are carefully assessed and the staff deployed as economically as possible District Nurses have received valuable assistance from State Enrolled Nurses and Nursing Auxiliaries who have undertaken duties for which the higher qualification is not essential A further delegation to general practitioner groups has taken place involving a State Registered Nurse and a State Enrolled Nurse and six Doctors, and plans are now going ahead for further attachments in 1973.

Incontinent Laundry Service The laundry service provided by the Department collected a total of 20,274 articles from the homes of incontinent patients for laundering at St, George's Hospital Collection and delivery of the articles continues to be undertaken twice weekly Nursing Homes Two private nursing homes are registered in the Borough, both of which are regularly inspected by the staff of the Health Department. These homes provide a total of 46 beds for acute and chronic sick patients. 28 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE No new schools were opened during 1972 The school population at the end of the year was as follows:- 86 Primary schools 26,737 pupils 25 Secondary schools (inc. Grammar schools) 17,708 " 2 Technical schools 1,512 " 3 Schools for E.S.N, pupils 401 1 School for sub-normal pupils 112 " Total 117 Schools 46,470 " Medical Inspection of School Pupils Section 48 (1) of the Education Act, 1944, requires local education authorities "to provide for the medical inspection, at appropriate intervals, of pupils in attendance at any school maintained by them" A series of regulations issued since the Act have stipulated in more specific terms how local authorities should meet this duty In the first instance, chi Idren were required to be examined as soon as possible after entry to school, in the last year of attendance at primary school and during the last year before reaching compulsory school leaving age, but subsequent regulations have allowed local education authorities more flexibility in meeting the provisions of this section of the Act The most recent revision (The School Health Regulations 1959) omitted any instruction regarding the frequency of medical inspections, but the accompanying circular advised that if a local education authority chose to carry out its responsibility by means of routine periodic medical inspections there should be three of these during a pupil's attendance. At the same time, it commended arrangements whereby only children brought to the attention of the school doctor by parents, teacher or school nurse should be examined, if the doctors were able to visit each school regularly In 1964, the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Education and Science published a report which summarised the situation at that time and pointedout that although routine school medical examination of all school children at least three times during their school life had been carried Dut for more than fifty years, the necessity for continuance of this procedure was being questioned by a number of experienced school medical officers. Schemes of selective medical inspection had been in operation before publication of the Chief Medical Officer's report and an 29 increasing number of local education authorities were known to have adopted the method Whilst there were arguments both for and against the selective method of medical inspection, the Chief Medical Officer concluded his report as follows:- "In short, in areas where the selective examination procedure has been carefully thought out, and introduced with conviction, it has been welcomed by parents, teachers and doctors, It brings the parents, teachers and school health service staff closer together and focuses their attention on the children most in need of medical advice and help It makes the work of the school doctor more interesting and vital; and it may well quicken research by the school health service into the problems of child health and educational retardation that still confront us" A pilot scheme of selective medical inspection of junior school leavers was introduced in Havering in 1967 with the approval of the Education Committee This proved to be a valuable experience resulting in more effective use of the school doctor's time and also helped to create improved co-operation between medical, nursing and teaching staff. Pilot scheme statistics showed that the number of selected children found to have defects requiring treatment was no less than the number found by routine inspections and Committee approval was given for the sqheme to be extended The selective system was eventually adopted for all junior and secondary medical inspections which not only had the effect of concentrating the school doctors' time on those children most likely to need their attention, but also enabled considerably more time to be spent on routine medical inspection of new school entrants at 5 years of age This initial medical inspection is the most vital and, since it is usual to obtain almost 100% parental attendance with the younger age group, the extra time available is most usefully employed in discussing and advising parents on their children's health problems From the initial and any subsequent selective or special medical examinations arrangements are made for regular surveillance of any child considered to require further observation. 30 The system of selective inspections currently adopted in Havering for junior and secondary school pupils is as follows:- 1 The school nurse carries out the usual preliminary screening tests of all children in the appropriate age group in exactly the same way as for a "routine" examination (vision and hearing, etc ) 2 Parents are asked to complete an enquiry form about the child's health and are given the opportunity to request a full medical examination, even if the information available would not normally indicate a need for selection 3 Teaching staff are provided with a full list of the children to be included in this age group and are asked to notify any who appear to have health problems Guidance is given toassist teachers in identifying such children, including notes on attendance problems, unsatisfactory standard of home care, poor performance at school, behaviour problems, hearing defects, unsatisfactory vision, and difficulty in reading or any other specific school subject 4 The school medical officer examines each child's previous medical records, together with the completed parental enquiry form and reports from teaching staff, in consultation with the head teacher, health visitor and school nurse, as necessary. From all this information, he selects those children who require a full medical examination 5 Any child who has never had a previous school medical inspection or for whom no previous medical record exists, is automatically given a full medical examination (This sometimes occurs with children moving into the Borough, or those who have previously attended an independent school) 6 In addition to the above procedures, parents are advised that medical facilities are not restricted to the periodic age group arrangements and they may request an examination by the school doctor at any time that they wish to have the benefit of his advice 31 In the "Report on the Health of the School Child 1969/70" presented by the Chief Medical Officer for the Department of Education and Science, a chapter is included on the medical examination and surveillance of school children, in which the value of various methods of routine and selective medical inspections used by different local education authorities throughout the country are discussed The information given shows that methods vary considerably from one authority to another, but fall into three main categories:- (a) Routine periodic examination of all pupils at specified intervals throughout their school life (b) Routineexamination of all newschool entrants followed by selective inspection at specified intervals of those most likely to require medical attention (c) Routine inspection of all newschool entrants, followed by subsequent examination of any pupil only by special referral (e g at request of parent, teacher, school nurse, etc ). No conclusions are drawn, but the following extracts from the report give comments on the most satisfactory arrangements (i) Entrant Medical Examinations: The lynch-pin of the arrangements for the surveillance of pupils is still a full examination of the child around the time of his first admission to school The time has not yet arrived when the surveillance of children during the pre-school years is sufficiently comprehensive and widespread throughout the country to dispense with a routine examination of all school entrants; even when such a time does come, there will always be a need for the last examination before five to be particularly related to the major event of entry to infant school (ii) Follow-up Visits to the Schools: Whether the entrant medical examination is carried out just before or just after the child has reached school, certain children will be recognised whom the doctor will wish to see again shortly or about whose progress he will wish to enquire The teachers may also have children about whom they would like to talk to the doctor again Close surveillance of the children during their first year at school is an important task 32 (iii) Subsequent Medical Examination on Request: The evidence available indicates that the special examination of a child on request from a parent, teacher orsome other person is the most appropriate examination to provide for the continuous surveillance of children once they are in school It is the most rewarding kind of examination for identifying at an early stage those defects which have arisen since entry to school If the school health service is to be mindful of the efficiency of its methods, it cannot disregard the extent to which routine medical inspections record for the second or third time defects known to have been present at an earlier examination The combination of a comnrehensive entrant examination and special examinations on request has the added advantage that it makes minimal demands on the doctor as a screener and maximal demands upon him as a diagnostician and medical adviser (iv) Periodic Parent Questionnaire: When the child approaches the age of 8 and 11, parents who have not previously requested an interview might be asked if they have anything concerning the health and development of their child about which they would like to talk to theschool doctor The fact that the school doctor finds no defects in a child whose parents asked for another examination should not be regarded as a criticism of the system of examinations on request nor as evidence that the examination was a waste of time (v) Periodic Screening Procedures: The following five screening procedures might be carried out at certain intervals during school life:- Test of visual acuity; Test of hearing; Measurement of height and weight; Survey of feet and back, of skin, and of hygiene; Cleanliness survey It may be noted that existing arrangements in Havering areacombination of the alternatives quoted in categories (b) and (c) above and the principles adopted are close to those set out in the suggestions (i — v) in the following ways:- 33 1 All children entering school at 5 years of age are given a full medical examination and the school medical officers are able to devote extra timeto this important medical examination 2 Continued surveillance of children whose progress needs to be kept under observation is arranged by means of a routine re-call system and informal contact between school doctors, nurses and teaching staff- (School doctors are allowed regular sessions for this purpose ) 3 Arrangements exist for any child to be given a special medical examination by the school medical officer at any time at the request of the parent, teacher or nurse 4 Routine screening tests and cleanliness inspections are carried out by the school nurse periodically or by special request 5 At the age of 10 and 14 years, parents are asked whether they have anything concerning the health or development of their child about which they would like to talk to the school doctor (this question is asked on the selection enquiry form) 6 Afterconsultation with parents, teachers, health visitors and nurses, specially selected children are given a full medical examination at 10and 14years of age, including any special requestsfrom parents mentioned in (5) above Periodic Medical Inspections 4671 pupils were given a full periodic medical examination by a school medical officer during the year and 5233 others were considered not to require full examination as a result of the selective procedure Defects noted at periodic medical inspections included the following:- Condition Requiring treatment Observation Defective vision 227 404 Squint 48 41 Defective hearing 48 275 Nose and Throat conditions 60 319 Lung conditions 34 149 34 Cont'd Condition Requiring treatment Requiring Observation Speech disorders 47 85 Developmental abnormalities 43 224 Skin diseases 88 166 Psychological conditions 37 308 Orthopaedic defects 87 215 Special Medical Inspections and Re-inspections In addition to pupils examined at periodic inspections 1183 children were specially examined at the request of parent, teacher or nurse, etc Defects found at these special examinations included the following:- Condition Req uiring treatment Requiring observation Defective Vision 45 77 Defective Hearing 33 135 Nose and Throat conditions 14 35 Speech disorders 9 12 Developmental abnormalities 12 77 Skin diseases 36 1 Psychological conditions 27 132 Orthopaedic defects 55 44 A further 2674 re-examinations were carried out as a follow-up of previous routine or special inspections Screening Tests School nurses carried out the following routine screening tests of vision and hearing during the year:- V ision tests Hearing tests Infants 6113 5549 Juniors 11652 8950 Secondary 4697 1369 Special School pupils 277 237 TOTALS 22739 16105 35 Cleanliness Inspections 21200 Cleanliness inspections were carried out by school nurses during the year 161 children were found to be in an unclean condition and cleansing notices were served on the oarents of 2 of these Specialist Services In co-operation with the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, the following Specialist consultation and treatment services have been held at the Council's clinics:- (a) Ophthalmic 3495pupils made5720 attendances at ophthalmic specialist clinic sessions held at 8 of the Council s clinics These included 873 new referrals and 1018 prescriptions for glasses were issued (b) Orthoptic Nonsurgical treatment of squint is provided by an orthoptist who holds regular sessions at 2 of the clinics 191 pupils were referred for this treatment from the ophthalmic specialist clinics and 451 treatments were carried out, (c) Orthopaedic 208 pupils made 593 attendances at orthopaedic specialist sessions held at 4 of the Council's clinics, including 78 new referrals (d) Physiotherapy In conjunction with the orthopaedic specialist sessions, 622 pupils made 1977 attendances for physiotherapy at 5 of the Council's clinics These included 215 new referrals Child Guidance Dr J.L. Swift, was appointed Medical Director of Raphael House Centre for Educational and Family Probfems on 1st January, 1972, to fill the vacancy resulting from the resignation of Dr, J.L. Vincenzi in July, 1971 In addition to traditional child psychiatry within theClinic, there has been a move towards expanding the consultation and liaison services offered bytheChild Guidance Clinic to agencies and schools within the community, a service offered by the Child Guidance Clinic team of Psychiatrist, Educational Psychologists and Psychiatric Social Workers With four Psychiatric Social Workers in post, it has been possible to offer greater liaison service with each Area Social Work team, and the Clinic has now become a regular practical placement for student Social Workers Child psychiatricservices in the hospitals isahitherto neglected field, but links are being forged in this area Whilst the Clinic is a Local Authority facility, children's needs know no administrative boundary, and the Child Guidance Clinic staff should be seen to have a concern for all areas of child health in the Rorniinh 36 661 children attended Raphael House for child guidance, including 328 new cases, as follows:- No. of Interviews Psychiatrist 1071 Psychiatric Social Worker 2869 Educational Psychologist 304 303 cases were under treatment at the end of the year Speech Therapy The Speech Therapy staffing situation has continued to restrict the service to the most urgent cases Although an additional full-time therapist was appointed in August, 2 members of the staff (1 full-time and 1 part-time) resigned in November and another full-time therapist had to revert to part-time owing to health reasons. At the end of the year the total staff amounted to 2 full-time and 1 part-time speech therapists. This is totally inadequate to provide a comprehensive service to all children with speech and language problems, and only a skeleton service can be provided until such time as the staffing situation can be improved 322 children were newly referred for speech therapy during the year, and 257 commenced treatment. At the end of the year, 175 children were under treatment, 274 were being kept under observation and 118 were waiting for treatment to be commenced School Dental Service 18428 children received a routine dental inspection at school during the year, and 4946 children made a total of 13065 attendances for treatment at the 9 dental clinics. The report of the Chief Dental Officer appears on page 40. School Clinics and treatment of minor ailments Special school clinic sessions are held regularly at each of the Council's clinics and at the School Clinic situated in Hilldene Junior School These sessions are attended by school doctors and nurses providing facilities for medical consultation, follow up of previous medical inspections and treatment of minor conditions 37 Total attendances at these sessions amounted to 13035 including 3857 medical consultations and 9178 interviews or treatments by the school nurses. Conditions treated included the following:- Skin diseases 2174 Diseases and defects of the 134 ear, nose and throat Eye diseases 91 Miscellaneous minor 850 conditions Handicapped Pupils In September, 1972 a new unit for Partially Hearing Pupils was opened at Broadford Primary School 8 pupils were admitted, including 2 from the London Borough of Barking. The full list of Special Schools and Units for handicapped pupils in the Borough is now as follows:- Corbets Tey School E.S.N, pupils Dycorts School E.S.N, pupils Havering Grange School E.S.N, pupils Ravensbourne School E.S.N, (subnormal) pupils and multiple handicaps Nursery Class for pre-school maladjusted children — Mead Infants School Unit for Partially Hearing Pupils — Hacton Junior School Unit for Partially Hearing Pupils — Broadford Primary School 38 The statistics relating .to ascertained handicapped pupils during the year are as follows:– Category Total number of pupils ascertained as handicapped a end of year.

Wheeler joined the staff as Deputy Chief Dental Officer However, as another member of staff resigned in October to take up a hospital appointment this left the staffing situation only marginally improved from the previous year with a whole time equivalent of 6.0 dental officers against 5.6 on 31st December, 1971 The staffing ratio was 7,745 school children per dental officer. The establishment for dental auxiliaries wasalso increased during the year to two, but despite repeated advertisements there was unfortunately no recruitment before the year ended and the Authority remained without the services of this valuable class of ancillary 2 Inspections and Treatment The number of school children receiving a first dental inspection during the year, either at school or at a clinic rose again during the year to a total of 22,358 or forty-nine per cent of the school population, The following table gives particulars of the dental inspections carried out, together with the figures for the previous year. 1972 1971 School Population 46470 45957 First Inspected 22358 20790 Found to require treatment 8284 7204 Offered treatment 7876 6827 Treated 4946 5095 Of those inspected, thirty-seven per cent were found to require dental treatment and of those offered treatment at a clinic, sixty-three per cent commenced a course of treatment, 40 An encouraging feature of the year's figures is the increased number of children completing their courses of treatment and being rendered dentally fit There wasa sliahtdrop in the number of treatment sessions worked during the year and in addition to staff fluctuations, this was to some extent attributable to the lengthy period of power strikes in the earlypart of theyear which disrupted surgery work The treatment pattern continues to place a strong emphasis on conservation In the permanent dentition, 13 teeth were filled for every tooth extracted, and if those teeth that were extracted for solely orthodontic reasons are excluded, this ratio climbs to 17:1 As the Borough Council has decided against the principle of water fluoridation, it has been necessary to consider the various proven topical measures of applying fluoride to the tooth surfaces in order to increase resistance to caries. All patients are recommended to use a toothpaste containing fluoride, but self-application apart, other measures are all expensive in terms of professional time Without ancillary help, cases need to be carefully assessed for future benfit The method adopted for selected caries-prone children was the application of a fluroide gel using preformed trays 3 Dental Health Survey In order to build up a picture of the overall state of dental health in school children in the Borough it was decided to carry out a survey in conjunction with the routine school dental inspections Information is to becollected from three age groups initially — 5 years, 8 years and 11 year olds —in line with principles laid down by the World Health Organisation for dental surveys, and their recommended criteria used A decayed and filled (df) count is made for all 5 year olds and a decayed, missing and filled (DMF) count for the 8 4- 11 year age groups The survey commenced in the autumn term and is intended to be an on-going surveywith the results of the firstyear of examinations providing a base-line for the future The resultswill be of use in evaluating future dental health programmes 4 Dental Health Education The dental health programme for new school entrants entered its third year during 1972 with a concentrated schedule of visits to Primary Schools in the Borough A new seven-minute film specially made for 3 — 6 year 41 olds by the Oral Hygiene Service was purchased for inclusion in the programme Entitled, 'Henry and Jessicat', it is a delightfully told simple story of a small boy's visit to a neighbouring farm It has a dental message which provides amDle opportunity for class discussion One of the first projects undertaken by Mr Sawle on being appointed Senior Dental Officer with special responsibility for dental health education, was to bring small groups of junior school children into the clinics and introduce them to the various activities carried out in the dental surgery This was a team exercise bythe dentistand his surgery assistant and participation by the children obtained by taking and casting study models of their teeth, followed by discussion and questions This was followed up by projects on teeth and dental health being done by the children in school The increasing involvement of Health Visitors in group practice work has meant that much less time has been available for dental health education sessions inschools bythese important members of the health team 5 Training Mr Sawle was successful in obtaining the Diploma in Dental Public Health in July on completion of his one-year course of study and returned to full-time duties the following month Courses attended by staff during the year included a twoday postgraduate course in Orthodontics at Keele University and a refresher course which the writer helped to organise for the Dental Group of the Society of Community Medicine in Oxford This had the theme, 'The Dentist, His Team and the Community' Reports from these courses were later presented to colleagues at staff meetings 6 Under Five and Maternity Service Every effort continues to be made to encourage mothers to arrange a dental check for their young children as soon as all their teeth have erupted In many cases this is as early as two and a half years old and if regular visits are begun at this age there is a much improved chance of dental disease being contained and to some extent prevented These initial visits provide an opportunity to reinforce the earlier instruction to mothers on careful dietary supervision given by the Health Visitors. 42 Even at this early age, it was found that forty-seven per cent of those inspected required treatment. Although the total number of sessions available for treatment was reduced this year, the proportion of time spent in treating the priority classes was increased to 9.5% of the total, Continuing the conservative approach, 5.6 deciduous teeth were filled for each extracted The amount of treatment completed again showed an increase over previous years as the following table demonstrates 1972 1971 1 970 Number of courses of treatment completed during year 411 346 225 Sessions devoted to treatment 168 189 159 The full annual statistics for the Dental Service are given in the following tabies DENTAL INSPECTIONS& TREATMENT OF SCHOOLCHILDREN INSPECTIONS (a) First inspection at school Number of Pupils 18,428 (b) First inspection at clinic Number of Pupils 3,930 Number of (a) 4- (b) found to require treatment 8,284 Number of (a) -I- (b) offered treatment 7,876 (c) Pupils re-inspected at school or clinic 1,386 Number of (c) found to require treatment 762 ATTENDANCE AND TREATMENT Ages 5-9 Ages 10-14 Ages 15 & over Total  First Visit 2,851 1,798 297 4,946 Subsequent visits 4,166 3,333 620 8,119 Total visits 7,017 5,131 917 13,065 Additional courses of treatment commenced 463 227 30 720 Fillings in permanent teeth 1,599 3,611 898 6,108 Fillings in deciduous teeth 4,488 351 – 4,839 Permanent teeth filled 1,338 3,173 834 5,345 Deciduous teeth filled 4,243 333 – 4,576 Permanent teeth extracted 49 301 62 412 Deciduous teeth extracted 1,645 516 – 2,161 General anaesthetics 385 104 7 496 Emergencies 594 240 20 854 43 Cont'd Number of Pupils X-rayed 843 Prophylaxis 1,127 Teeth otherwise conserved 966 Number of teeth root filled 85 Inlays – Crowns 27 Courses of treatment completed 4,161 ORTHODONTICS New cases commenced during year 71 Cases completed during year 60 Cases discontinued during year 10 Number of removable appliances fitted 87 Number of fixed appliances fitted – Pupils referred to Hospital Consultant 6 RES 5 to 9 10 to 14 15 & over Pupils supplied with full denture – – – – Pupils supplied with other dentures (first time) 2 1 3 Total – 2 1 3 SESSIONS Number of treatment sessions 1,878 Number of inspection sessions 144 DENTAL SERVICE FOR EXPECTANT AND NURSING MOTHERS AND CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS Children 0-4(incl ) Expectant and NursingMothers First Visit 536 70 Subsequent Visits 652 118 Total Visits 1188 188 Number of Additional Courses of Treatment other than the First Course commenced during year 56 5 Treatment provided during year — Number of fillings 800 118 Teeth filled 739 116 Teeth extracted 131 26 General anaesthetics given 47 – Emergency visits by patients 64 18 Patients X-rayed 6 33 Patients treated by Scaling and/or Removal of Stains from the teeth (Prophylaxis) 161 26 Teeth otherwise conserved 114 – Teeth Root Filled – 1 Crowns – 8 Number of Courses of Treatment completed during year 411 52 DENTURES Patients supplied with full denture (First Time) – – Patients supplied with other dentures – 4 INSPECTIONS Number of Patients given First inspections during year Children 0-4 (incl ) 850 Expectant and NursingMothers 63 Number of Patients who required treatment 353 47 Number of Patients who were offered treatment 339 46 Number of Dental Officer Sessions Devoted to Maternity and Child Welfare Patients — For Treatment 168 45 HEALTH EDUCATION In 1972, the Health Education programme followed the same lines as in the previous year, details of which were given in my last Annual Report The main programme was directed to Dental Care, particularly to the infant age groups of school children, Foot Care for the 8—11 year olds, and the dangers of Smoking for the older school children Talks and film shows on the various topics covered by the Health Education Section were also given to adult organisations, and as an experiment further sessions consisting of a film show and talk on antosmoking were advertised. These were quite well attended, even though the uncertainties of power strikes which coincided with the dates, made it difficult on occasions for the publictoget to the talks in blacked out streets, and when they did arrive, there was the possibility of a power cut preventing the films being shown Apart from talksgiven by Public Health Inspectors, Nursinq Officers, Health Visitors, etc , the Health Education Section gave 218 talks and/or film shows during the year The main list of subjects was as follows:- Drugs, Smoking, Home Safety, Foot Care, Dental Care, Hygiene, Sex Education, Mouth to Mouth Resuscitation, First Aid and Venereal Diseases. 67 of the talks given were on Dental Care, and 46 were on Smoking, and these were attended by approximately 9,000 school children Many schools availed themselves of the various films which the Health Education Section has on various health topics, and over 60 films were lent during the year for periods of a week or more — presumably for showing to various classes HOME SAFETY: Once again, under the auspices of the Havering Home Safety Panel, the very successful annual Home Safety Quiz for pupils at Secondary Schools was organised The Final was held at Rainham Secondary School, when Harrowfield School, runnersup in 1971, won the 1972 Final by beating Brittoris Secondary School, and were presented with the Peter Teskey Trophy by the Worshipful the Mayor, Alderman W.J. Cole I would like to take this opportunity of recording my thanks 46 to Miss E. Thompson of the Social Services Department who undertook the arrangements for the Quiz, and for the work she has carried out through the year in connection with Home Safety. My thanks also to the Headmaster of Rainham Secondary School for the arrangements for the Finals and Semi-Finals, to the Education Department for their co-operation, and to the Visual Aids Officer for the provision of amplification and other equipment used in the Finals 47 CHIROPODY SERVICE The Chief Chiropodist, Mr L.A. Bolland, reports as follows:Statistics for 1972 New Cases No. of persons treated Clinic attendances Domiciliary Treatments Treatments at Welfare Establishments Pre-school Children 9 17 59 - - School Children 55 83 268 - - Expectant Mothers 10 14 16 - - Aged 944 5241 17525 8047 1495 Physically Handicapped 62 252 536 401 83 Others 91 105 65 97 1 Total 1171 5712 10469 8545 1579 Although underestablished, the Service throughout the Borough was maintained until the beginning of December, when, regrettably, it was necessary to close the Chiropody Clinic at Cranham. This was, however, re-opened in February, 1973 Domiciliary Treatments After consideration it was decided to pay on a Capitation basis for certain domiciliary visiting, to take effect from 1st of January, 1973. It is hoped that this arrangement will help to reduce the waiting list for home treatments, Accommodation Approval was given for a purpose built chiropody room at the Rainham Clinic This should be completed early in 1973 Staffing During the year two resignations were received from fulltime staff One subsequently applied for re-newal of service. One part-time member of the staff applied for,and was appointed, to full time employment Applicants were interviewed, following an advertisement during December, and two appointments were confirmed, one full time and one part time This meant that the chiropody service was underestablished by only one chiropodist. 48 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE. This scheme provides medical screening of all prospective employees of the Council The scheme also covers investigation of any medical matter affecting individual employees or groups of employees, and medical examination of Council employees in connection with heavy goods vehicle driving licence Entrants to the teaching profession and candidates for admission to teacher training colleges are also examined in accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Education and Science Statistics relating to this service are as follows:OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE Number of questionnaires scrutinised 1993 Number selected for full examination 105 Number found unfit for employment 5 Number recommended for further review 5 Medical examinations for other authorities 11 Number of full medical examinations of teachers and prospective pupil teachers (carried out according to national requirements outside the Council scheme) 345 Number of persons screened by chest X-ray (i e duties in contact with children) 1160 Number of persons screened for intestinal pathogens (i e duties concerned with preparation of food) 539 Number of special medical examinations 135 Medical examinations for heavy goods vehicle driving licences (3 unfit to hold licence) 50 MENTAL HEALTH As stated in lastyear's Annual Report, reports on patients discharged from hospital after treatment for mental illness continued to be forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health and 324 such reportswere received during 1972 Relevant information contained in the reports was made available to the Social Services Department With the formation of the Community Psychiatric Nursing Service increasingly the referral of these patients will be made direct to these nurses who visit these patients whilst still in hospital and will initiate referral for social work help as necessary From June 1972 these nurses made 118 visits 49 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH Staffing The Council's policy of centralising Departments in Romford was brought to fruition so far as this section was concerned with the move of the section and the rest of the Health Department from the Council Offices, Billet Lane, Hornchurch, to "Mercury House", Mercury Gardens, Romford, on the 1st and 2nd July, 1972, the Department becoming operational in its new location as from Monday, 3rd July, 1972 This necessitated a considerable change in our working habits — vacating ground floor accommodation and being rehoused on the 10th floor of a multi-storey office block served by lifts The vacancy for a District PublicHealth Inspector existing at the beginning of the year was filled in March Unfortunately this Inspector resigned in the Autumn but was replaced in December The Public Health Inspector who specialised in Food and Drugs retired in October his duties being taken over by another District Public Health Inspector This vacancy for a District Pub! c Health Inspector was filled at the end of the year An additional post of Public Health Inspector was created by the Council for special duties connected with improvement areas, the post being filled at the beginning of October and a new appointment of aTechnical Assistant was filled in theSpring The third year Student Public Health Inspector duly qualified mid-year and obtained a post as District Public Health Inspector with a neighbouring London Borough at the end of July This vacancy was filled by the appointment of a new Student in September and he started his first year's training at Tottenham Technical College — a three year course The Senior Public Health Inspector and District Public Health Inspector who had been stricken with serious illness during 1971 both returned to duty in a restricted capacity in the late Spring On 31st December, 1972, the Environmental Health Inspectorate consisted of:- 50 1 Chief Public Health Inspector 1 Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector 3 Senior Public Health Inspectors 1 Senior Shops & Offices Inspector 1 Food Inspector 11 District Public Health Inspectors 2 Shops & Offices Inspectors 2 Authorised Meat Inspectors 1 Technical Assistant 3 Pest Control Officers/General Assistants 3 Pupil Public Health Inspectors The Environment The Borough Planning Officer informs me that during 1972 a number of decisions which have been taken on a regional basis could have a long term effect on the Borough The Government's decision on the location of Maplin as a site for a third London Airport will have a considerable impact on the employment pattern of the area, creating as it will an area for employment diverse from the traditional pattern of the Inner London area The communications into the Airport are likely to pass close to, if not through the Borough, and for this reason there has been added interest in the proposed route of Ringway 3 and the M.16 road line The line for Ringway 3 has been published for the route between the A 13 to the A.12 and a public meeting held No final decision as yet has been made concerning the road and rail links to Maplin, but some information is likely to be released before long The creation of major motorways close to or through the Borough may make increased demands on the accident service of the local hospitals it could well be that Harold Wood Hospital, when the expansion plans are complete, will have an accident unit Being only a mile from the major interchange between the M.16, Ringway 3, M.12 and A.12 Trunk Road at the junction with the Brentwood By-pass, makes it well placed to serve this particular function This year has marked a great increase in the interest shown generally by the public in the total environment The Public Meeting into improvements to A.13 resulted in a very vocal demand for the officers of the Department of the Environment to look at possible alternative routes 51 There is increasing concern over all pollution factors, whether the pollution be in terms of noise, atmosphere or visual intrusion into personal life The lack of basic facilities on an area - such as limited open space - is not so easily accepted now and there is increasing concern as to the density at which new development is taking place This is a difficult economic matter, since land prices have continued to rise over the past few months and house prices have stabilised a little below the very high levels reached early in the year Food and Drugs Administration Sampling — During the year 435 samples — 37 formal and 398 informal — were taken One sample of pork sausages was 14% deficient in meat; proceedings were instituted against the vendor who was found guilty and fined £25 and £15 costs to the Council Eleven informal samples had faulty or incorrect labelling, which were rectified by the manufacturers on being informed of the contraventions Pesticide Residues in Food - During the year 19 samples of food were submitted to the Public Analyst in connection with the third national survey to estimate the level of pesticide residues in food for sale in this country Of the 19 samples examined none was found to contain an appreciable amount of residue 52 Food Complaints - 257 Food complaints were received during the year, of which 66 were referred to the Public Analyst and included in the above figures 14 prosecutions were taken in relation to food complaints and fines totalling£460 were imposed and £158.80 costs awarded to the Council Details of these prosecutions are as follows:- Complaint Result of Legal Proceedings Fine Costs Bandage in Breakfast Cereal £25 £8 Foreign matter in Currant Bun £5 £5 Glass in Milk £20 £5 String in Ready Mix Pastry £50 £10 Brush Bristle in Milk £50 £10 Mouldy Sausages £30 £20 Mould Growth in Milk £50 £10 Sour Cream £50 £10 Sour Cream £50 £10 Decomposing Meat Pie £25 £10 Complaint (cont'd ) Result of Legal Proceedings Fine Costs Paper Foil in Meat Pie £25 £8 Piece of Metal in Swiss Roll £10 £22.60 Cockroach in Cornish Pasty £40 £17.60 Mould Growth in Milk £30 £12.60 The commodities involved in the 257 food complaints were:- Baby Foods 5 Ice Cream 3 Beverages 2 Jam 3 Bread 37 Meat, fresh 8 Butter 4 canned 15 Cereals, dry 8 Meat Products 29 canned 1 Milk 26 Cheese 11 Pickles 2 Cooking oil 1 Poultry 9 Cream 4 Ready Cooked Meats 5 Dried Fruit 2 Soft Drinks 5 Fish, fresh 2 Soup, canned 1 canned 3 Sweets 6 Fish paste 1 Sugar 1 Flour Confectionery 21 Vegetables, fresh 3 Flour 1 dried 1 Frozen Foods 6 canned 7 Fruit, fresh 1 Yoghourt 3 canned 20 The number of food complaints received during the year was slightly less than for the previous year, the decrease was mainly in those complaints resulting from bad storage and inefficient stock rotation Bacteriological Milk Sampling — 153 Milk samples were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination during the year Pasteurised milk — 95 (one sample failed both the methylene blue and phosphatase test, and one sample failed the methylene blue test ) Sterilised milk — 18 (all satisfied the turbidity test) Ultra heat treated- 40 (all satisfied the UHT test) The reduction in the number of samples of pasteurised milk submitted for bacteriological examination is due to the removal of several milk vending machines — only three now remain operating within the Borough 53 Brucella Abortis - No samples have been examined for Brucella Abortis as all milk sold within the Borough is heat treated Ice Cream Sampling — During the year 233 samples of ice cream were submitted for bacteriological examination, with results as follows:- Grade MOBILE SHOP Total Soft Other Soft Other I 24 38 7 101 170 II 7 14 3 19 43 III 6 3 1 7 17 IV 3 - - - 3 40 55 11 127 233 The results of bacteriological sampling of ice cream show an improvement of the standard on 1971; the percentage of grades III and IV has fallen from 23% to 8.5% Four ice lollies were also submitted for bacteriological examination and were found to be satisfactory Bacteriological Sampling of Other Foods — During the year the undermentioned foods were submitted for bacteriological examination. Cream — 31 Raw Meat — 7 Cream Cakes — 42 Shellfish — 3 Cooked Meats — 56 Canned Fruit — 1 Meat Products — 14 Fish Products — 1 Sausages — 14 Cooked Rice - 3 Rolls & Pies — 11 The results were mostly satisfactory, except for a short period when unsatisfactory samples were being obtained from a meat processing factory, which was quickly remedied by improvement of the general hygiene within the factory Fresh cream was also again giving intermittent poor results Essex County Council Act, 1950 — S 103 — Food Hawkers During the year under review 11 applications for registration as hawkers of food were granted, viz: 54 4 ice cream 3 sea food 3 greengrocery 1 hot dogs Poultry Processing Premises Department of Health & Social Security Circular 1/73 requests information concerning poultry inspection There are no poultry processing premises within the Borough Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933 During the year seven names and seven premises were added to the list kept by the Health Department in pursuance of Section 21 of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933, the applicants thereby becoming entitled, subject to the provisions of the Act and the Poisons Rules, to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List Eleven names and 15 premises were removed from the list during the year At the end of the year the list contained the names of 87 persons (or firms) involving some 134 premises No formal actionwas required during the year in respect of any infringements of this legislation Milk Distributors During the year the number of registered milk distributors remained at seven, operating from 10 dairy premises 190 traders are, however, registered for the sale of pre-packed milk from their premises, includina three milk vendina machines Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963, as Amended The number of licences granted by the Council during the year, together with the total number valid at the end of the year, are shown in the following table All these licences expire

issued during the year covering the period 1st April, 1972 to 31st March, 1973, the conditions of the licences requiring that the premises should not be opened at any time between 11.00 pm and 5.00am This figure is an increase of three on the previous year As mentioned in the preceding heading, occupiers of premises who wish to keep open after 11.00 pm are required to be registered as Night Cafes under Part VIII of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act, 1968 The fee payable for a Refreshment House Licence is E6.00 Game Act, 1831 Five firms were authorised and empowered by licence to

previous year) Eight of these authorised the licensees to slaughter horses, this beinga regular practice at one of our slaughterhouses Twenty four of the licences were for ritual slaughter — 22 Jews and 2 Mohammedans Five of the licences to slaughter by the Jewish method were subject to the condition that the person to whom it was granted must not slaughter any animal except under the supervision of a person holding a licence which was not subject to a like condition With the exception of two journeymen all the licensees operate in slaughterhouses in this Borough Slaughterhouses and Meat Inspection Three slaughterhouse licences were issued during the year In one-instance the owner also being granted consent to carry on the offensive trade of fat rendering There was no change during the year in connection with the agreed hours of slaughter, i e from 7.00 am to 6.00 pm Mondays to Fridays and from 7.00 am to 2.00 pm on Saturdays and Sundays, in two instances, the third slaughterhouse being a 57 very small one at the rear of a butcher's shop, killing only for their own retail trade - this killing taking place during normal hours and, therefore not the subject of an

Meat Inspection (Amendment) Regulations, 1971 As mentioned in last year's report, the Council agreed to the implementation of new maximum charges as from 1st October, 1971, viz 18p for a horse or adult bovine, 5p for a calf or pig and 4p for a sheep, lamb or goat The income from this meat inspection service during the year was £4,381.06 Diseases of Animals Act, 1950 The Regulation of Movement of Swine Order, 1959 continued in force throughout the whole of the year, and several hundred movement licences were received from various markets and dealt with Towards the end of the year further restrictions were imposed on the movement of pigs, due to outbreaks of Swine Vesicular Disease This required conditional licences to be issued for the outward movement of pigs, in order to prevent the spread of infection; also a close watch on pig carcases at our slaughterhouses for any signs of the disease, which clinically is indistinguishable from foot and mouth disease Visits to our 12 licensed boiling plants were also increased as part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food overall preventive measures, thus enabling us to check the adequacy of their swill boiling plant and the state of health of their animals; also the efficiency of movement records, the keeping of which became a statutory requirement The Brucellosis (England & Wales) Order, 1972 came into operation on 1st November, 1972, enabling the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to cause animals to be slaughtered on account of brucellosis on payment of compensation Sanitary Circumstances This year's pattern of work followed very much that of the previous year There was a sustained demand for Qualification Certificates under the Housing Act, 1969 and the Housing Finance Act, 1972, which it is anticipated will continue to grow with the additional publicity now being given to this very topical legislation A summary of the 33,888 inspections is as follows:- 60 Clean Air Act 2,861 Public Health Acts 6,714 Food & Drugs Act 4,540 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 5,550 Offices, Shops & Railway Premises Act 1,447 Shops Acts 2,245 Infectious Diseases 627 Housing Acts 3,639 Sampling 982 Factories Act 233 Noise Abatement 278 Diseases of Animals Act 53 Miscellaneous 2,896 Slaughterhouses & Meat Inspection (not including the inspections of 2 Authorised Meat Inspectors based permanently at slaughterhouses) 1,209 Consumer Protection 614 As a result of these inspections 664 informal notices were served and in 169 cases further action was necessary, with the service of Statutory Notices — details as follows:- Number of Notices Served Informal Statutory Public Health Acts 211 165 Food & Drugs Acts 93 - Offices, Shops & Railway Premises Act 226 - Shops Acts 118 - Factories Acts 3 - Housing Acts 2 - Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 9 4 Slaughter of Animals Act 1 - Landlord & Tenant Act, 1962 1 - 664 169 Enforcement Proceedings No legal proceedings were instituted in respect of Statutory Notices served under the Public Health and/or Housing Acts 16 court cases were taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, resulting in total fines of £525 and costs of £221.85;

In the meantime this and other unauthorised gypsy encampments continue to give trouble 62 Refuse Collection The Cleansing Section is part of the Controller of Works Division, the Administrative Headquarters of this Division being situated at Upper Rainham Road Personal enquiries regarding services provided by the Controller of Works are also entertained at the various Borough Offices The Controller of Works states that - "Approximately 100,000 dustbins are emptied each week by110 collectors using 30 vehicles of the most up-to-date rear loading compression type in addition approximately 250 special collections are made each week for bulky household items Some materials, such as builders' rubbish, garden refuse, rubble and fencing are not collected but such items can be taken by residents' own private transport to the disposal site in Gerpins Lane This site, and all other refuse disposal operations, are now controlled by the Greater London Council" Street Cleansing This work of clearing over 300 miles of roads is carried out by 21 teams each normally consisting of two sweepers and an electrical truck operator and 40 street orderlies with hand barrows Four suction type sweeper collecting machines are employed in carriageways, although increases in parked vehicles makes the use of these machines less effective A Work Study has now been completed in the Street Cleansing Section, and it is hoped that the implementation of this Report will lead to an improved service throughout the Borough Refuse Disposal As mentioned previously refuse disposal arrangements for the London Boroughs is the responsibility of the Greater London Council (Department of Public Health Engineering) and the following information has been supplied by their Area Engineer:- "Household and shop refuse, street sweepings, gully detritus and highway waste material, is delivered direct by your collection vehicles to landfill sites at either Little Belhus, South Ockendon (Contractor) or Aveley No 1 Pit, Aveley (GLC) Trade refuse can be taken by tradesmen to the GLC transfer station at Frizlands Lane, Dagenham,where 63 a charge is made depending on weight or capacity It is hoped that a weigh-bridge will be installed shortly at the GLC Aveley No 1 landfill site and then tradesmen will be able to deliverdirect to thissite should it be more convenient than Frizlands Lane A civic amenity site is operated by the GLC at Gerpins Lane, Upminster, where Havering residents may deliver most types of waste materials emanating from private dwellings, including garden refuse, but not old cars or large quantities of car parts This site is in process of being enlarged and also improvements for access and egress This work should ease the traffic congestion for residents at busy periods, particularly weekends Should any resident wish to dispose of an old car it may be taken to theGLCdepot at Frizlands Lane, Dagenham, during any working day, including Saturday morning where it will be accepted free of charge, subject to the signing of a surrender form and, if possible, the vehicle log book " Rivers, Streams & Watercourses The Essex River Authority have very kindly supplied fhe following information in connection with the year 1972:- 'During the year under review, a survey of the River Ingrebourne showed the river to be clean throughout its length within the Borough The effluent discharged from Nags Head Lane sewage disposal works which constitutes the major proportion of the flow was consistently of a satisfactory quality. The River Beam was found to be generally clean throughout the upper and middle reaches but some deterioration was noted in the lower reaches resulting from the Wantz Stream tributary which passes through the heavily urbanised and industrial areas of Dagenham Work continued throughout the period on investigation and elimination of the sources of pollution 64 In the Rainham area the industrial discharge causing high ammoniacal content in the local watercourse at Ferry Lane ceased early in the year and an improvement in the quality of the stream water was noted This trade effluent discharge will be resumed in 1973, but provision will be made for treatment prior to discharge" Water Supply I am indebted to the Essex Water Company for the following information regarding the water supply to the Borough "The water supply of the whole of your Area has been satisfactory in quality and quantity No action has been necessary in respect of any form of contamination The number of dwelling houses supplied as at 31st December, 1972, was 83,540 and the population, as obtained from the Registrar General was 247,130 The number of houses supplied by stand-pipe is not known for certain but the total is insignificant The Company does not make frequent fluorine determinations, but on the basis of past results the fluorine content of the major sources of river derived water is put at 0.25 p pm The sources serving the London Borough of Havering are:- North Essex Treatment Works (river supply) Hanningfield Treatment Works (river supply) Chigwell Row Treatment Works (river supply) Dagenham Well Station, NewRoad, Dagenham" Twenty-six samples were taken by the Health Department from the main supply during the year of which ten were submitted for chemical and sixteen for bacteriological examination In each case a satisfactory report was received 65 66 RAINFALL The following table shows the amount of rainfall recorded at four stations in the Borough during the year:— HORNCHURCH RAINHAM ROMFORD UPMINSTER Amount in millimetres No. of days in which rain fell Amount in millimetres No. of days in which rain fell Amount in millimetres No. of days in which rain fell Amount in millimetres No. of days in which rain fell January 6.15 22 51.6 13 58.7 20 59.7 23 February 28.9 16 27.2 12 27.3 16 27.8 16 March 43.6 15 35.0 12 41.0 14 42.5 15 April 44.0 21 33.8 13 36.8 17 34.3 18 May 35.4 19 25.8 15 35.2 19 30.6 17 June 40.0 15 30.6 13 25.2 14 40.3 17 July 40.9 11 36.1 10 35.2 8 32.3 10 August 33.7 6 26.1 4 25.3 5 20.7 5 September 46.8 6 29.6 6 41.1 5 36.8 7 October 5.5 3 6.1 5 5.1 4 56 5 November 51.9 15 40.9 13 51.9 15 49.8 18 December 50.3 15 45.0 13 44.3 12 48.1 14 TOTAL 482.5 164 387.8 129 427.1 149 428.5 165 LONDON WEATHER CENTRE 1972 Month RAINFALL SUNSHINE Total in mm Percentage of Average Wettest Day No. of dry days Total hours Percentage of Average Sunniest Day Date mm Date hours January 39.75 103 11 7.50 15 33 70 21 7.2 February 37.00 125 11 7.00 15 33 58 14 6.9 March 35.25 106 5 15.25 18 153 136 12 10.0 April 40.00 85 29 9.25 18 129 103 25 13.2 May 25.00 57 31 3.75 14 182 94 1 12.8 June 24.25 43 9 4.75 18 183 90 28 12.2 July 26 25 53 8,22 7.25 24 164 87 12 12.9 August 16.00 28 2 5.00 23 196 109 11 13.1 September 29 25 51 19 9 25 24 120 79 21 9.2 October 10 50 18 10 8 50 26 115 103 5 9.8 November 48.25 92 12 9.50 15 78 135 15 7.3 December 42.75 76 6 11.75 19 59 130 15 6.8 YEAR 374.25 65 March 5 15.25 229 1445 98 April 25 13.2 A dry day is defined as one with less than 0 25 mm (.01 inch) of rain during the 24 hours.

It is estimated that the capital cost involved will be approximately £M1.5 and it is hoped that construction will commence in the summer of 1973." Streets Made Up and Taken Over The following streets were made up and adopted by the Council during 1972:- Length in Yards Epping Close 28 Helmsdale Close 116 Beverley Gardens 23 Saddleworth Road 168 Saddleworth Square 80 Okehampton Road 133 Okehampton Square 80 Pontypool Walk 93 Penistone Walk 72 Truro Walk 51 Ingleglen 100 Castle Avenue 191 Fontayne Avenue 71 Aylett Road 101 Phyllida Road 90 Archibald Road 40 Ronald Road 128 TOTAL 1,565 yards HOUSING Number of New Dwellings Erected During the Year By the Local Authority 22 (176) By other Local Authorities Nil (72) By other bodies or persons 375 (886) In addition the Council completed 65 x 1 bedroomed flats and3 disabled persons units for a Housing Association The previous year's figures are given in brackets 71 Local Authority Accommodation The Housing Manager has kindly supplied the following information:- New completions 22 Relets 455 477 Homeless families rehoused 38 Rehoused from Reception Centres 23 Rehoused from Housing Waiting List 312 Rehoused under Industrial Selection 249 Scheme in New and Expanding Towns Further Warden controlled flats for pensioners were started on two sites and these will provide a total of 82 such units to be completed in 1973. Housing Finance Act The Council implemented the provisions of the Housing Finance Act in respect of the New National Rent Rebate Scheme and the new assessment of rents as from the 2nd October, 1972, Tenants Associations During the course of this year, quarterly meetings have been arranged between the Housing & Health Services Committee and representatives of the Tenants Associations within the Borough, This is in accordance with the wishes of the Council to involve tenant participation in the management of the Council's housing stock and the Council also expressed a wish to encourage the formation of new Associations for those estates which are currently not being represented by a Tenants Association. Broxhill Caravan Site. The Council agreed a programme for the reorganisation of this residential caravan site to bring the site up to the prescribed standards Seventy caravan standings will be provided, together with additional car parking facilities and other associated amenities for the better management of the site. This programme is being undertaken by the Controller of Works 72 South Park Caravan Site During the course of the year, orders have been placed to provide additional amenities for the site, for example, every standing is now being provided with facilities for hot water and for a proper supply of electricity. The total number of properties under management at the 31st December, 1972 was 14,401 together with 2,546 lock-up garages and 1,441 hard standings for vehicles At the end of the year the housing waiting list included 2,476 applications on the main list, 305 on the supplementary list and 842 on the engaged couples list. Housing Priority on Medical Grounds 447 applications for medical priority in connection with rehousing were received during the year, 257 being in respect of registrations on the waiting list and 190 from existing tenants requesting transfer to alternative accommodation Land Charges Act, 1925 The procedure regarding land charges enquiries remain as outlined in my annual report for the year 1969, the necessary liaison being maintained with the Town Clerk's Department in respect of the 7,462 searches which were made during the year 1972 Building Control Co-operation with the Borough Engineer & Surveyor and the Borough Planning Officer continued throughout the year and in all some 302 plans were referred to the Department for scrutiny and observations This enables the developer to incorporate our suggestions when actual building commences 73 HOUSING ACT, 1969 - PART I - IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Details of improvement grants for the year under review are given in the following table A Standard Grants Number of applications received 184 approved 125 " dwellings improved 108 Amount paid in grants £14,247.00 Average grant paid per house £131.91 Number of amenities provided:- a) Fixed bath/shower 43 b) Wash-hand basin 69 c) Hot water supply 74 d) W.C. within dwelling 78 e) A sink 6 Number of bathrooms added 18 B Discretionary Grants Number of applications received 102 approved 78 " dwellings improved 76 Amount paid in grants £32,144.00 Average grant paid per house £422.94 These applications necessitated some 725 visits by members of the Public Health Inspectorate each visit requiring full liaison with members of the Town Clerk's and Borough Engineer & Surveyor's staff HOUSING ACT, 1969 AND HOUSING FINANCE ACT, 1972 QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATES The following table gives details of the number of applications for Qualification Certificates received during the year together with the action taken:- A.

The Campaign was designed to encourage residents with certain properties to take advantage of grants of up to £1,000 that are available to pay towards improvements to their homes. Leaflet distribution displays in local libraries and clinics continued throughout the period and there were advertisement displays at the Town Hall and at the Havering Advice Centre During the final week display trailers from the Department of the Environment and the Gas and Coal Boards were stationed in Romford Market Place and at other sites in the Borough The local press also carried full page advertisements and features and London's Television screened advertisements nightly The whole campaign was backed up by local poster advertising and local stores distributed free carrier bags bearing slogans. Housing Act, 1969 (Part II) — General Improvement Areas During the year staff of the Town Clerk, Borough Planning Officer and Health Department carried out a public participation exercise for the creation of a General Improvement Area south of Brentwood Road, Romford It is too early to state whether the outcome is successful, but it will certainly serve as a useful pilot scheme to examine the possibility of other similar schemes at some time in the future. Romford Central Area Development The Romford Central Area shopping precinct has now been completed and is just beginning to settle down to serve as a major shopping centre in this part of the Greater London area. With a traffic free precinct of this magnitude one likes to think that there must have been a considerable drop in the number of accidents to pedestrians since this scheme came into operation There is now growing interest in the creation of an office precinct in the Eastern and Western Road area of Romford, and it is hoped to reach agreement during 1973 to the main parts of the scheme If successful, it is hoped that, in addition to extending the employment opportunities for office workers in theCentral Area of Romford, the provision of additional office facilities will 75 considerably reduce the number of people who have to travel outside the Borough to their places of employment, thus creating an improvement in general working conditions by a reduction in travelling time Housing Act, 1957 - Demolition and Closing Orders During the year the Council made3 demolition and 2 closing orders (one in respect of underground rooms) following representations by the Department Four of these properties were occupied and necessitated the rehousing of 13 persons One closing order — made in 1971 in respect of a ground floor flat — was determined by the Council following repairs and improvement by the owner which brought the flat up to the required standard. Conversion to Natural Gas In the Annual Reports for 1969 and 1970 information was included from North Thames Gas of the progress of their programme of conversion to natural gas within the Borough- Unfortunately no information was forthcoming last year but this year North Thames Gas state that considerable progress has been made since 1970 and in the conversion exercise has moved completely away from ine Essex Area into Central and East London and the last conversions of premises within the Borough were in mid March 1971. Over 76,000 premises and 229,000 gas appliances within Havering were converted and they again recorded their appreciation for the co-operation received from the Council during this phase of a massive operation Subsequently they centralised the administrative facilities for Customer Service, and other functions, in new premises at Southend in order to provide improved service and expect to continue to effect improvements Close contact is maintained with officers of the Council and recently discussed, with the Director of Social Services special schemes for the elderly and handicapped Clean Air Act, 1956 — Smoke Control Areas The Havering (No 6) Smoke Control Area - which had been deferred for 2 years - was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 19th July, 1972, the Order coming into operation on 1st July, 1973. 76 Applications for conversions in private dwellings were received in the Department almost immediately and achieved reasonable impetus until the Winter months when applications dwindled somewhat - probably to increase in the Spring of 1973 In the Autumn of 1972 the Council agreed to proceed with the Havering (No 7) Smoke Control Area The necessary Order was made on 1st January, 1973, and was confirmed by the Secretary of State for the Environment on 26th March, 1973, to come into operation on 1st November, 1973 Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution The seven sites in the Borough containing instruments for the daily measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere were all continued during the year These instruments operate in accordance with the national scheme controlled by Warren Spring Laboratory, Department of Trade & Industry The Council maintained representation on the National Society forCleanAir and the Standing Conference of Co-operative Bodies for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution Chimney Heights — Clean Air Act, 1968, Section 6 Seven applications for approval to chimney heights were received during theyear-a decrease of fouron the previousyear In two cases alterations to height were required, the other five being approved. 77 MISCELLANEOUS Noise Abatement 35complaints were investigated during the year, a decrease of 31 on 1971 10 referred to commercial premises, 22 domestic, 3 industrial, 5 construction, roadworks, demolition, etc , 3 noisy icecream chimes and 2 others Two ice cream vendors were prosecuted under Section 2 of the Noise Abatement Act, 1960 for operating musical chimes during the prohibited periods Fines of £15.00 were imposed and costs amounting to £5.00 were awarded to the Council In the past two years spasmodic road traffic noise checks have been undertaken by the Public Health Inspectors without any real direction, but because of an accepted need to monitor the obvious increase in traffic noise a more thorough investigation was required. During this latter period the first concentrated noise readings were undertaken on behalf of the Borouqh Engineer in order to provide evidence for a public enquiry into the proposals to convert a road into a dual carriageway by shortening people's front gardens The readings obtained were produced at the enquiry by the Health Inspector and they provided useful evidence which was acceptable to all parties as an independent record of the noise conditions applying at that moment of time Towards the latter part of 1972 it was agreed that systematic recording of road traffic noise should be undertaken throughout the Borough and consultations with the Borough Engineer's Division produced an excellent working agreement, whereby noise level readings undertaken would, wnere desirable, be monitored against a vehicle recording strip In addition, to assist the Borough Engineer, it was agreed that special readings required in conjunction with proposed road improvements would be given priority As this work commenced the Department of the Environment Circular 10/73 — Planning and Noise — was issued, setting out standards, criteria and methods which have been closely followed The London Borough of Havering is a typical fringe borough of London comprising of industrial and residential property The borough is traversed by three trunk roads, the A 12, A 13 and the A 127, conveying large volumes of traffic The London Borough of Havering Noise Traffic Survey commenced in December, 1972 with the object of assessing the 78 noise produced on main trunk roads, secondary roads and residential roads used at peak traffic periods as alternative routes. The difficulty in measuring road traffic noises arises due to the rapid fluctuation from 50 dB(A) to 90 + dB(A). The sound level meter must, therefore, be easy to operate, simple in design and of robust construction. With these points in mind two Acos sound level meters complete with calibrators, extension leads and tripod were purchased A more expensive meter with press button for the various dB(A) bands and wave band analysis is possessed by the Department, but has proved unsatisfactory for road traffic readings Additional equipment which hasalso proveduseful is acassette tape recorder,although this is not essential Looking to the future the acquisition of a chart recorder would be very useful for continuous monitoring of traffic noise, Pest Control Two of our three Pest Control Officers are licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in accordance with Section 10 of the Protection of Birds Act, 1954,to use stupefying bait for killing or taking wild birds. This enables these officers to undertake operations against feral pigeons, and once again particular reference was given to certain British Railways' property The baiting of the Council's sewers against rats is dealt with by the staff of the Borough Engineer & Surveyor, who use specialist firms for this purpose, The following is an extract from the Annual Report on Rats and Mice for the year ending 31st December, 1972, which is sent to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food on Form I R 31 under authority of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949:- Non- Agricultural Agricultural Premises Premises 1 Total number of properties (including nearby premises) inspected following notification 4,845 - Number infested by: a) Rats 3,369 - b) Mice 1,476 79 cont'd Non- Agricultural Agricultural Premises Premises 2 Total number of properties inspected for rats and/or mice for reasons other than notification 5,535 213 Number infested by: a) Rats 10 - b) Mice 5 Civic Amenities Act, 1967 10 prosecutions were taken by the Council during the year under Section 19 of the Civic Amenities Act, 1967 All we e in respect of the illegal dumping of rubbish Fines totalling £65 were imposed and costs totalling £34 awarded to the Council Hairdressers and Barbers No certificates of registration were issued during the year in respect of new businesses as hairdressers (barbersi but 15 registrations were made concerning change of ownership The total number of registrations at the end of 1972 was 169 Cemeteries The Council operate 4 cemeteries all sited within the Borough, the number of interments — including cremated remains — taking place during the year was as follows:- Cemetery Adults Stillborn Children Romford 407 22 Hornchurch 72 2 Rainham 78 8 Upminster 202 4 759 36 During the year three interments were carried out under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 Crematorium The number of cremations carried out during 1972 at the South Essex Crematorium, Ockendon Road, Corbets Tey, Upminster was 3,103, an increase of 297 on the previous year These included 1,303 from the Borough — an increase of 113 — the corresponding figures for 1971 being 2806 and 1190 A new scale of fees came into operation on 1 st January 1972 80 The development of three additional acres of land on the west side of the Crematorium - which includes the main car park - was completed during the year, the remainder being used for the disposal of cremated remains All inspections on the Roll of Remembrance have been transferred to the Book of Remembrance in the new Hall of Memory Mortuary TheCouncil does not provide or maintain a public mortuary Use, however, is made of the facilities provided by the Romford Group Hospital Management Committee at Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, at an agreed cost of £3 per body The Hospital Management Committee provide all the necessary labour, services and equipment required for post mortems 285 bodies were received during the year, an increase of 17 on the previous year Common Lodging Houses There are no common lodgings houses in the Borough Rag, Flock & Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 Routine inspections were carried out on the two registered premises in the Borough.

The Senior Inspector advises and directs the District Inspectors regarding emphasis of inspections as well as coordinating accident investigations and conducting new surveys of particular interest The section works alongside the District Public Health Inspectors who to save the need for unnecessary duplication enforce the Off ices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 in food shops The Shops Inspectorate are responsible for the following legislation:- Shops Act 1950 — 65 Young Persons (Employment) Acts 1938 - 64 Offices, Shops & Railway Premises Act 1963 Consumer Protection Act 1961 — 71 Ancillary duties involve the licensing and control of employment agencies and registration of cafesfor installation of gaming machines All three Inspectors are fully qualified holding the Diploma of the Institute of Shops Acts Administration Mr S.F. Titterton, Senior Shops & Offices Inspector of the Council was elected to the position of Vice-Chairman of the Institute of Shops Acts Administration for the year 1972/73 and Chairman for the year 1973/74 In granting leave of absence to permit him to officiate, congratulations were conveyed to Mr. Titterton on the honour bestowed upon him. THE SHOPS ACT 1950 - 65 This legislation which many consider should be removed from the Statute Books controls the trading hours of Shops, both on weekdays and Sundays and seeks to ensure staff receive basic entitlements such as meal breaks, half day holidays, time off for Sunday employment as well as affording additional protection to those under 18 years of age 87 To say such legislation is unnecessary is totally contrary to the opinions formed by the Borough's enforcement officers, the representing trade union and the National Chamber of Trade No law is perfect and of course, there are areas where greater flexibility would be advantageous to allow the law to keep up with the ever changing trend in the retail distribution trades. Entry into Europe Many thought that entry into Europe on the 1st January, 1973 would see the 'Continental Sunday' spreading across the channel, resultant in many more shops opening here on a Sunday Such thinking was short lived with the introduction of an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act 1972 which raised the penalties for Sunday trading tenfold. References to £5 now become £50 and references to £20 become £200, The original penalties having been operative since 1936 were not a deterrent to those shopkeepers who sold items on a Sunday such as motor cars, where any subsequent fines could be readily paid from the profits of such illegal transactions. Sunday Trading and Employment The level of illegal Sunday transactions within the Borough is still high. The majority of these transactions though are of a minor nature and take place in shops which can legally stay open for permitted items, thetemptation is tosupply non-permitted goods to regular customers rather than lose their patronage. This area of enforcement is very unpopular with both the public and the shopkeeper. Blatant cases of illegal trading from those shops which cannot legally remain open on aSunday are dealt with vigorously. Particular attention is paid to shops where staff are employed, to see that the Statutory records are kept and compensatory holidays in respect of fuIl.-time employees are allowed A total of 237 Sunday visits were made resulting in 65 infringements being noted 88 Five occupiers appeared in court on a total of ten summonses, one occupier making two appearances during the course of the year Half of the summonses were in respect of Petrol Service stations, an area where it is still difficult, because of shift methods of working, to ensure compliance Evening & Early Closing Early closing day observations commanded far more attention than the evening closing provisions, there being an air of jealousy over traders who take advantage of staying open for six days without authorative consent of the Law Provisions do exist which allow six day trading to become operative but this involves ballots of the interested traders During the year Six Day Trading Orders were made in Romford in respect of Mens' Wearing Apparel Home Decorators' Supplies and in Elm Park, in respect of Mens', Ladies' and Children's Wearing Apparel It is customary that when a shop closes for an early closing day that on that afternoon the staff receive their weekly half • holiday With the increase of six day trading this-area of enforcement is made more difficult A total of 1,105 visits and observations were made and 133 infringements found Several of these infringements resulted in legal proceedings, details of which are enumerated in the tables below TABLE OF ENQUIRIES Early Closing 1,105 Evening Closing 48 Sunday Trading 237 Employment of Young Persons 264 Conditions of Employment 427 Sunday Employment 160 Others 1 T otal 2,242 89 TABLE OF INFRINGEMENTS Early Closing Day Failing to exhibit an early closing day notice 29 Failing to close for the 'serving of customers' 14 Failing to observe the Regulations 14 Evening Closing Hours Failing to close for the 'serving of customers' 2 Sunday Trading Failing to close for the 'serving of customers' 6 Failing to observe the Regulations 28 Conditions of Employment Failing to exhibit notice specifying the day of Assistants' weekly half holiday 76 Failing to allow assistants a weekly half holiday Nil Failing to allow intervals for meals and rest 8 Failing to exhibit the Abstract of the Act and to keep records of hours worked by young persons 126 Failing to give young persons at least eleven hours consecutive rest to include 10p m and 6a.m 2 Exceeding maximum permitted hours of employment of a young person 2 Failing to keep a record of Sunday Employment 14 Failing to allow holidays in lieu of Sunday employment 13 TABLE OF PROSECUTIONS No Section Offence Result 1 1 No early closing day notice (2 cases) £5 fine on each 1 Open on the early closingday(1 case) £5 fine 17 No half holiday allowed (1 case) £5 fine 2. 17 Assistants half holidayNotice(3cases) £3fine on each 19 No lunch hour allowed (2 cases) £1 fine on each 22 Sunday Records (1 case) £3 fine 32 Young Persons Records (2 cases) £3 fine on each 3 1 Open on the early closing day (1 case) £1 fine 4 17 Assistants half holiday Notice (1 case) £5 fine 19 No lunch hour allowed (2 cases) £1 fine on each 22 Sunday Records (1 case) £10 fine 5 47 Sunday opening (1 case) £5 fine 6 47 Sunday opening (2 cases) £5 fine on each (Director aiding and abetting offences) (1 case) £5 fine 90 TABLE OF PROSECUTIONS (Cont'd ) No Section Offence Result 7 47 Sunday opening (1 case) £5 fine 8 17 Assistants half holiday notice (1 case) £10 fine 19 No lunch hours allowed (4 cases) £5 fine on each 22 Sunday Records (2 cases) £10 fine on each OFFICES, SHOPS & RAILWAY PREMISES ACT 1963 This Act prescribes minimum standards for safety, health and welfare in commercial and other non industrial workplaces Premises registered under the Act are inspected by the Shops and Offices Inspectors or, in the case of Food Premises, by the District Public Health Inspectors Registration and General Inspections (1) Class of Premises (2) No of Premises Registered during the year (3) Total No of Reg'd Premises at end of year (4) No of Reg'd Premises receiving a Gen Inspection during year Offices 30 547 58 Retail Shops 91 1216 266 W'Sale Shops, W'Hou ises 2 43 24 Catering Establishments open to Public, Canteens 11 139 59 Fuel Storage Depots — 6 - Total 134 1951 407 Visits by Inspectors to Registered Premises Total 1420 Accidents Analysed by Workplace Workplace No Reported Total No Investigated Prosecutions Offices 12 7 Retail Shops 70 53 W'Sale Shops,W'Houses 12 9 Catering Establishments open to Public, Canteens ;

Of these, two were found to contain excessive quantities of lead in the paint Eighteen offences under the Electrical Colour Code Regulations were investigated. Thirty six nightdresses without the necessary inflammability warning were found Fifty one offences under the newElectric Blankets (Safety) Regulations were investigated An increasing number of enquiries have been dealt with on a variety of home safety matters These include:- Dangerous toys, foam rubber, cooking utensils, babies' dummies, and seeds, Several articles have been sent to the Home Office for examination.

All applications for agency licences are carefully vetted and premises intended for use inspected. Annual re-inspection as well as spot checks during the year are also made Controlling legislation at present only requires licensing in respect of applicants placed in permanent employment. Gaming Act 1968 — Amusements with Prizes It is an increasing trend in cafes and public houses to provide for customers, amusement machines which give prizes. The Gaming Board saw fit to include these machines within the scope of legislation, which although one 'gambles' on them, is gaming in one of its less socially objectional forms. Prizes are paid in the form of tokens exchangeable for goods supplied over the counter and not for cash Control is considered necessary and while the Police look after those in Public Houses, the Local Authority's Shops Inspectors inspect cafes and restaurants and recommend the issue of licences where considered suitable. Points considered include access by schoolchildren, seating capacity of the premises and positioning of the machines In premises where schoolchildren are likely to frequent the panel of Councillors who form the Licensing Committee insist on a notice prohibiting use by persons under sixteen years of age Machines are only intended for use by diners and not the take-away trade as in the case of a fish restaurant. At the end of the year 32 premises held licences issued by the Local Authority 95
