WHI 36 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION &c., &c., of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (WITH VITAL STATISTICS), FOR THE YEAR 1888 By JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Surgeon to the London Sailors' Home, &c. london : printed by penny and hull, leman street, whitechapel, e. 1889. Office of the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District, No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., February 21 st, 1889. Gentlemen Before commencing my Annual Report for the year 1888, it may prove useful and not entirely uninteresting to note briefly certain statements contained in the Annual Report of the Registrar-General for the preceding year. The recorded death-rate for registration London was 19.57 Per 1000, whilst the corrected death-rate for the year equalled 20.77 Per 1000. The year 1887 was again a year of remarkably low rates; the marriagerate and the death-rate being each the lowest on record, and the birth-rate the lowest since 1849. The marriage-rate equalled 16.2 persons to 1000 of the population, and the birth-rate was 31.7 to 1000 inhabitants. This summary is not quite so accurate as usual in its distribution of the deaths amongst the various sanitary areas, for I note that we are credited with 25 fewer deaths than really took place in the Whitechapel District. REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1888. IT will perhaps be remembered that I commenced my last Annual Report by expressing my belief that "the great influx of foreigners into our District has ceased," and I then offered some explanations in support of that opinion, but I also confessed my inability to produce completely satisfactory evidence in proof. I allude to this matter now because the Jewish Board of Guardians, and also the Royal Commission on "Sweaters and Sweaters' dens," were interested in the question, and as these gentlemen came to the same conclusion as myself, based upon larger opportunities for such special observation, and for investigating the various facts which become involved in such an inquiry, there can be but little doubt concerning the correctness of the inferences I have deduced. If, therefore, in the year 1887, the population of the Whitechapel District numbered 73,485, and if since then emigration and immigration were fairly balanced, the increase of births over deaths during the intervening period will bring the present population up to 74,500. This estimate is supported by the calculation to which, in previous years, I have resorted in estimating the population from the mean of the two last known birth-rates. Assuming the accuracy of the above statement, I can still further estimate the population of the SubDistrifts as follows :— The Spitalfields Sub-District has 21,857 Mile End New Town ,, 24,142 Whitechapel Church ,, 17,127 Goodman's Fields ,, 6,114 Aldgate „ 5,260 Of course it must always be remembered that short periods and a paucity of figures afford too frequently untrustworthy results, that too small a number of units of observation may lead to 6 what fallacious results. As an illustration, I quote from a recently published journal. Thus, a question in the House of Commons, "Whether at a particularly unhealthy station on the West Coast of Africa, the mortality among the troops was 750 per 1000, and whether the Government proposed to take steps to prevent this shocking loss of life by withdrawing the garrison ?" The answer was, " that the force consisted of a corporal's guard of four men; that one had been killed by a shark while bathing, a second bitten by a snake while gardening, and a third despatched by delirium tremens while drinking; and that the death-rate was therefore correctly stated in the question, but that it was hoped the next detachment would be more fortunate. The total births which were registered in the Whitechapel District during the 52 weeks of the year 1888, were 2607; an increase of 35 as compared with the preceding year. The total deaths which were registered during the same period numbered 2173, fewer than in 1887 by 73, and 84 fewer than in 1886. These statements are arranged at the commencement of the Appendix in the Tables A and B*. Suffice it is to mention here that 1299 boys were born to 1308 girls; whilst 1235 males and 938 females died. It must be remembered that allowance has to be made for those non-residents who select public institutions within the Whitechapel District wherein to be treated for various illnesses, and there dying, have their deaths registered in those Sub-Districts where the institutions are. These non-residents have been eliminated from the corrected Tables, whilst residents who died either in the District public institutions, or in outlying public institutions, have been referred to the Sub-Districts where the patients previously resided, so that a fair statement of the District mortality returns has been compiled. Table C† contains particulars of the 719 persons whose deaths were registered in the District, although they had previously come from other parts of the metropolis, or from the suburbs. That the London Hospital is situated in the Whitechapel Church SubDistrict accounts for nearly the whole of this large number of non-residents, of whom 708 contributed to the death-register in * Page 19. †Page 19. 7 this Sub-District, while I each was registered in the Spitalfields and Goodman's Fields Sub-Districts; 7 in the Mile End New Town Sub-District; and 2 in the Sub-District of Aldgate. For a record of those residents—to the number of 120—who died in public institutions outside the District, Table D*may be consulted, and therein will be found a detailed list of the institutions, as also the number of persons who sought in them either a home, or refuge for special diseases. These absentees contributed 7.6 per cent. to the total deaths. The foregoing factors enable me to state the exact District mortality for the year to be 1574, which constitutes a death-rate of 21.1 per 1000. Such a death-rate is 7 less than I recorded for last year when I had the pleasure to report that the death-rate was " the lowest ever recorded in the District." Table E† is arranged to exhibit the deaths correctly referred to each Sub-District. To appreciate more fully the value of this statement, I will mention that last year there was a diminution of 32 deaths as compared with 1886, and this year I have to report a still further falling off of 28. Whitechapel Church Sub-DistriCt alone did not contribute to this meritorious result. The natural increase of births over deaths is 1033. I invite you to compare this increase with the increase in preceding years during which I have had the honour to superintend the health work of the District:— In 1884 the increase of births over deaths was 905 1885 ,, ,, „ 945 1886 ,, ,, ,, 901 1887 „ ,, „ 970 1888 ,, „ „ 1033 Before discussing as usual in detail the causes of death during the year, I pause to note the percentage of deaths for each age period:— 25.2 % of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 15.8 „ ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.1 ,, „ „ „ 5 and 20. 13.2 „ „ ,, „ 20 and 40. 19.7 „ „ „ „ 40 and 60. 18.8 „ „ ,, „ 60 and 80. 2.9 „ „ ,, over the age of 80. * Page 19. †Page 20. 8 The improved state of the District is obvious. Last year 44.9 per cent. of the deaths occurred under the age of 5 years; during the year we are now considering only 41 per cent. died under that age. At the other end of life you will also notice that in 1887 17.4 per cent. of the total deaths took place at over 60 years of age; and in 1888, 21.7 per cent. reached that limit. I have reverted in detail to this branch of the subject in the article upon "Infant Mortality.'' Those who survived to beyond 80 years of age numbered 24 women and 21 men. Of these 4 were nonogenarians. Our Jewish residents carried away the palm for longevity. These aged persons were distributed amongst the several Sub-DistriCts as follows:— 15 belonged to the Spitalfields Sub-District;. 10 ,, Mile End New Town Sub-DistriCt. 16 ,, Whitechapel Church ,, 3 „ Aldgate „ 1 ,, Goodman's Fields ,, The registered causes of death indicate that 20 of them succumbed to disease—chiefly of the chest or nervous system— and 25 died from "old age." Analysis of the Cause of Death of the 1574 Residents who Died during the Year 1888. I have, as heretofore, arranged the District deaths in the same manner as that adopted by the Registrar-General, for the deaths occurring throughout the entire Metropolis; thus by consulting together Table M* and N†, the exact value of the figures which apply to the Whitechapel District becomes apparent. This result is summarised in Table I‡, wherein is set out in adjoining columns the per centage of deaths for each separate class of disease, to the total deaths, as well for the whole of London, as for the District with which we are especially concerned. And please note the initial and most important class—a class of disease essentially within the power of sanitary bodies to control—zymotic diseases. Here the Whitechapel District shows up remarkably well, and observe, that whilst both the Metropolis as a whole and Whitechapel exhibit an improvement compared with the preceding year, the diminished rate for London is less than 2 per cent. and in Whitechapel it is nearly 3 per cent. In comparing the relative per centages of deaths in the other classes of disease, one is struck * Page 23. †Page 24. ‡Page 22. 9 by the slight variation which exists between the figures in the parallel columns. You will perceive that we suffer somewhat more from constitutional and respiratory diseases, and also from violence, but the latter, as you are aware, is a very unusual distinction. During the year the civilized world heard with horror of the terrible outrages which took place in Whitechapel. They followed one upon another, in a manner with which every one is familiar. All bore the same evidence that one person was concerned, and that person without doubt was a lunatic. It is also clear to those who are familiar with the District, that were the miscreant a resident in the district, he could not have escaped detection. So customary has it been for strangers to credit Whitechapel with all crimes which take place in the East of London, that it is no uncommon thing for newspaper headings to declare outrages to have occurred in Whitechapel which in reality were far removed. The Registration forms for the past 26 years prove that since March 1862, and up to September 1888, a total of 19 deaths due to murder took place. Of these 6 were cases of Infanticide, and 5 were included amongst the awful crimes which occurred during the first 9 months of this year. Of the remaining 8, four were reported from the London Hospital, and no addresses were forthcoming, and thus no information was given to connect the cases with our District in any way—-in fact, in one instance it was distinctly stated, that the victim was discovered in a railway carriage at the St. Mary's Station. I have now narrowed this inquiry to 4 cases, one of which was the poisoning of a child by its mother, who herself at the same time whilst of unsound mind, committed suicide by similar means. I proceed to specify how the zymotic percentages of 15.40 and 11.30 respectively are composed:— Diseases Causing Death. Entire Metropolis. Whitechapel. Small-pox 0.011 0.0 Measles 3.045 1.524 Scarlet-fever 1.532 1.143 Typhus-fever 0.012 0.0 Whooping-cough 3.790 2.350 Diphtheria 1.649 1.334 Enteric-fever 0.845 0.825 Simple Cholera and Diarrhoea 2.830 3.176 All other Zymotic Diseases 1.075 0.952 Small-pox and Typhus Fever are conspicuous by their absence from the Whitechapel District. 10 Measles were responsible for 24 deaths, as against 52 last year; and Scarlet Fever removed 9 more persons last year than this. Seven more deaths occurred from Whooping Cough this year, but this Autumn, only about half the usual number of infants were sacrificed to Diarrhoea. On the other hand both Diphtheria and Enteric Fever proved more fatal this year, 28 more deaths being registered from these diseases. Whilst engaged in discussing the causes of death, one naturally turns aside to investigate particulars concerning diseases which may not have terminated fatally in all cases, and thus we are brought face to face with other most important sets of statistics. The ultimate benefit hoped for from such investigation is clearly to lessen the frequency and scope of certain diseases, even though they cannot be entirely stamped out. It becomes, therefore, my duty as well as pleasure, to again refer to the work performed by your old Inspectors, Messrs. Battram and Wrack. Such work as can be classified and arranged, has been set out in tabular form, and bears witness to the excellent character of the work. Your Board, however, is aware that very much of their labour though essential to the well-being of the District, cannot be registered. And here permit me, Gentlemen, to thank you most heartily for the recent addition to the Sanitary Staff, by the appointment as Inspector, of Mr. Thomas P. Wrack. I am grateful, as well for the help he affords, as for the unreserved manner in which you placed his services at my disposal. I hope to satisfy you at a future time that a great sanitary advance has been the outcome of this aCtion upon your part. In the Table O* which contains a Street List of the principal zymotic diseases dealt with by your Inspectors during the year, it will be noticed that the numbers are fewer than usual. This return is a most valuable one, because it enables your staff to at once attack any centre of disease, and thus obviate the tendency to an enlargement of area As an illustration I may mention a case which recently occurred. At 12 o'clock on Thursday the 28th of March, 1889, it was reported at the office that a case of small-pox was at a cottage in Dock Street. The Metropolitan Asylums' Board was informed by telephone of the fact. I attended, and learned that the patient, who was a seaman, had arrived the previous day fr6m Lisbon. The Port Sanitary Medical Officer * Page 25. 11 was notified by telegram to enable him to attend to the ship, and thus remove an important risk of spreading the disease. The four persons who had risked contagion by association with the patient were immediately re-vaccinated. At 2 o'clock the Ambulance removed the sufferer, and your officers at once proceeded in the customary manner to disinfect everything in the place. As in the cases I reported in my last communication, I shall expetft that this will terminate our work in connection with what might have been the commencement of a serious epidemic. The remaining Table which I annex as a corollary to this branch of the subject, will sufficiently explain itself. It is compiled from Weekly Returns supplied to me by the Managers to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board—and it contains a record of all cases received into their Hospitals from London—including the Whitechapel District—and also those cases striftly belonging to the District:— Disease. Whence Admitted. First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Total.

This concession took effect only during the last quarter of the year, hence the reason for no entries in the other three quarters under this heading. The question as to whether cases of Measles, should also be received has been under discussion —but no decision has been arrived at. It therefore remains for the Local Government Board to decide. As I have not received a correct statement of the total population in these dwellings, I am unable to Deaths in compile a return giving the accurate death-rate. Model I append, however, a Table which specifies the Dwellings. number of deaths in each class of disease. Thus, it appears that a total of 151 deaths during the 12 year, were referred to the Model Dwellings within the District. I am of opinion that most of the Buildings contain about the same number of persons as formerly—but the Royal Mint Square colony has become considerably enlarged, and therefore, as the total deaths are fewer, it follows, that the death-rate must have materially diminished.

If this be so, you would from what I have previously stated, anticipate a more favourable paragraph than usual. Nor will you be disappointed. A glance at the Age Distribution Table as compiled from the Mortality Returns, suffices to shew that the 13 deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London equalled 24.3 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.6 per cent. of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District, those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 25.2 per cent. of the total deaths, against 27.5 per cent. last year; and 15.2 per cent. of the registered births, against 17.1 per cent. reported in 1887. The deaths of children under 5 years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 41.2 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.8 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 41.1 per cent. of the total deaths this year, against the previous record of 45.0 per cent.; and 24 8 per cent. of the registered births, which last year reached 28.0 per cent. These deaths amounted during the year to 29. They were registered in the undermentioned Asylums :— Extra In Banstead Asylum 13 Metropolitan Colney Hatch ,, 10 Deaths. Hanwell ,, 3 Leavesden ,, 3 Four died at over 80 years of age; 11 between 60 and 80; 10 between 40 and 60; and 4 between 20 and 40. Brain diseases proved fatal in 17 of the cases; 3 of the deaths were due to constitutional causes; 1 took place from Heart disease; and old age was the registered cause of death of 8 Twelve were men, and 17 were women.

Five of the deaths were due to "Premature birth"; 1 to " Measles"; 2 to "Convulsions"; 1 to "Diarrhœa"; and 1 to " Exhaustion." In the London Hospital there died during the year 708 Non. Residents, and 123 persons whose previous Public residence had been in some part of the WhiteInstitutions chapel District. In the Whitechapel Union within the Infirmary the deaths of 340 Residents, and 7 District. Non-Residents were registered. Last year the total deaths of Residents in the Infirmary amounted to 285 ; and in 1886 and 1885, they numbered respectively 316 and 292. i5 Registered Particulars appertaining to this class of Dwell.

It therefore remains for the incoming Governing Authority—so soon to commence office— to deal with these Districts in the only manner in which it can be possible to effectually remedy the existing evils. In the meantime, by constant vigilance, your Officers have maintained those areas in a fairly satisfactory condition. A great deal has been written upon this subject during the past months, and as I am aware that some mis. Workshops. understanding exists in some minds, with regard to the Authorities who are responsible for such so.called workshops, I have reproduced the salient points to be borne in mind. There are four classes of workshops subject to different jurisdictions :— 1. A place where children, young per. Here the Government Inspector inter. sons, men and women work. feres in Sanitary matters in the Workshop only. 2. A place where adults, both males Here the Government Inspe&or has no and females, only work. power to interfere in the Workshop, beyond his enquiry into the legal employment of women. 3. A place where men only work. Here the Government Inspector has no power whatever. 4. A place where members of the same Not subject to the Government In family work in a dwelling house. pedtor sanitatively. Therefore in all the Classes of Workshops except the first named, sanitative action is relegated to the Local Authorities, the Factory Inspector's visits being only to restrain the hours of labour, so that his ability to deal with Sanitation, Ventilation, or Overcrowding depends on whether or not any person be found under the age of 18 years at work. The entire work of the District Medical Officers has been arranged under Table H* of the Appendix. The Pauper aggregate is somewhat higher than that for the Statistics. preceding year, but it would seem that the class of patient has undergone some change. It appears * Page 21. 17 that fewer now apply solely to obtain relief orders, but Medical Relief is now generally required. The Infirmary is also more popular, and the skilful treatment by the Medical Superintendant, aided by his very efficient staff, proves an attraction to the sick poor. Thus it comes to pass, that as regards the District Medical Officers' cases, the following are the numbers for three years :— In 1886 the total orders received were 3501, of which 2038 were for admission. 1887 „ „ 3983 ,, 2340 „ 1888 „ „ 4079 ,, 2643 „ I have extracted from the Weekly Statements issued by Mr. William Vallance, Clerk to the Whitechapel Board of Guardians, the following figures :— The Infirmary contained during the year, numbers varying each week from 697 to 543, and making a weekly average of 607.4. The weekly admissions have ranged between 102 and 42, equal to an average of 69.6 per week. The Workhouse during the same period contained numbers varying from 368 to 238 and had a weekly average of 293.8. The entire list of paupers resident in the Institutions under the control of, or used by the Guardians, I find gives for the whole year an average per week of 1514.1. The highest number during any week was 1667 in the 9th week of the 1st quarter; and the lowest number was in the 2nd week of the 3rd quarter when it was 1402. These figures as usual bear testimony to the excellent work of Mr. W. M. S. Sherman, the Vaccination Vaccination Officer to the Whitechapel Union. I have Statistics. inserted the details in Table L* of the Appendix. The Whitechapel District receives its Water Supply from the East London and New River Companies. These Water Supply companies have carried on their operations in the to the usual manner. From the Analytical Returns District. furnished by the Government Water Examiner, and also by the statements of Messrs. Tidy and Oddling, it is certain that our Water Supply is good and sufficient. * Page 22. 18 In accordance with my annual custom, I conclude this part of my Report by asking your attention to Tables Meteorological Q and R*, where are exhibited many interesting Returns. particulars appertaining to Returns compiled from weeely'papers supplied from the Office of the Registrar.General. It is probable that influences are here recorded, more or less intimately connected with the hygienic condition of the Country—and thus eventually from them may be evolved information of a kind which may serve a useful purpose. It remains for me only to congratulate your Board upon the continued general improvement in the Whitechapel District. I have the houour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOSEPH LOANE.
