72829 Sou I 4 30 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY by the MEDICAL OFFICES OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1869. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honor, this evening, to place before you the thirteenth Annual report of the births and deaths, and likewise the sanitary condition of the District of St. George the Martyr. Many events of considerable importance to this small division of the Metropolis, have come to pass in the period of time that has gone by, since the first Annual Report was presented to you. Work has been done; obloquy borne; prejudice lived down; sickness prevented, and life lengthened. Proposals then made, and which were considered wild and impracticable, have not only been put into practice, but have become obsolete, and fall far short of what is now confidently demanded. The folly of yesterday has become the wisdom of to day. Long years must however elapse before the good done can become fully manifest. A more plenteous harvest shall greet future reapers. But the present is not void of encouragement. Although it has scornfully been said of Statistics, that they are like cobwebs, beautifully reticulated, and orderly to look upon, yet, that they would hold no conclusion; nevertheless they have proved of inestimable value to the Social Reformer. Without statistics, Sanitary Works would not have been carried out so fully and so universally as we now find them. They have revealed to many a town and neighbourhood, which were considered by the inhabitants as possessing all the elements which aid in the maintenance of health and strength, that their state was precisely the reverse; that their mortality has reached far beyond that which characterises a healthy locality. The proportion of deaths to the population, has proved painfully sensational, and has aroused them from their state of false security. Statistics have shown truly in all places how far the life of man has fallen short of the allotted period of three score years and ton; and they have shown also, by what diseases it has been assailed, as well as pointed out the epidemics that from time to time have hastened thousands away to an untimely grave. They have for ever established the fact, that where man has lived in the midst of filth, within undrained streets, over cesspools, and amid grave yards filled with the dead of many generations, and where he has drank water, in which there was literally death in the glass, that sickness has been abiding, and life short. Down to almost the present period, owing to our helplessness and ignorance, and owing to the stern inflexibility of nature's laws, we have been as victims 31 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1868— 9. ready to perish. People similarly circumstanced as regards climate, occupation, and food, have died, some at the rate of 17 per 1000 persons living, and others at the rate of 38 and more per 1000 persons living. Two regiments, during the American war, were encamped with no greater distance between them than a quarter of a mile: in one there wore about twelve men ill; in the other two hundred and fifty. Sanitary arrangements made the whole difference. It is the completion, or the want of completion, of sanitary arrangements that makes the variance in the prevalence of sickness and rate of mortality. A mighty influence for good is exercised by the weekly publication of the tables of mortality of the Metropolis, and of some of the principal towns and cities of the country. The tables drawn up and given in the various Annual Reports, and which I fear are generally skipped, are nevertheless of groat importance, and worthy of serious attention. They form indeed the basis upon which the Reports are made, and prove the source of any instruction and warning which may bo offered. As an old writer on the Bills of Mortality from 1057 to 1758, has quaintly said, "forasmuch as it is not good to let the world bo lulled into a security and belief of impunity by our bills which wo intend shall not be only as death's heads to put mon in mind of their mortality, but also as Mercurial Statues to point out the most dangerous way that lead us into it and misery." This "most dangerous way" is less thronged than formerly, for since the many great sanitary measures have been carried out, wo find that the average length of 23 years of life in the 17th century, had in the 18th century increased to 35 years; whilst in the present century it has reached to 45 years. But, what is still more interesting to us in the illustration of this truth, is what the Registrar General tells us in his Summary of the Weekly Returns of Births, Deaths and Causes of Death in London during the year 1868. After speaking of the mortality being below the average ho goes on to say:— "The improvement is most striking in South London. The mortality there was at the rate of 38 and 35 per 1000 in the years 1849 and 1854; during the average of five years 1840—44 it was 25, of five years 1845—49 it was 28, and during the five years 1850—54 it was 26; in 1855—59 it fell to 23; in 1860—64 it was 23; and in 1865—68 it ranged from 22 to 24; in the last year it was 23. The mortality is now lower in south London than it is in north London." It is also gratifying to find that in spite of our position—low-lying; and that in spite of our condition—crushed by poverty, "the mortality by cholera was very little above the mortality of the favoured districts of west London." In the year 1868-9 that ended on Saturday, 3rd April, 2172 births were registered; 1113 were male children, and 1059 were female children. They were 114 in excess of the year 1867-8. The deaths registered were 1501; the deaths of the males were 742; and those of females 759. Like the births the deaths were in excess, and to the number of 149. The excess of births over deaths was 671. TABLE No. 1. Years 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 Deaths ??? ??? 1385 1457 1584 1739 1479 1551 ??? ???

The mortality from Zymotic diseases, and by which are meant small pox, measles, scarlet fever and the like, has been 329. Comparing; it with the deaths from the same diseases in the preceding year, there has been an increase of forty-one. Much, very much has been done, but much more remains still to be done, before these preventable diseases will bo trampled out. I think at the present time, a little too much is expected from those who are using their utmost endeavours to bring about this desirable end, whilst nothing, or next to nothing, is done by these for whom all these efforts are made. Good cannot be forced upon any one; the recipients must be willing and prepared. In Great Britain the mortality now caused by Zymotic diseases is about 22 per 1000 deaths, or one in forty-five of the population. We cannot state with certainty whether the germs from which these poisons take their origin, can under certain circumstances start anew into existence; or, whether they have always existed, and are always present, but from some conditions of their own, or other surroundings remain in a dormant state, as the seed remains dormant until planted. I believe as regards fever, that it may arise from a cold, and become the source of infection. The Acts which have been passed to enforce vaccination are beginning to tell, as shown by the decrease of small pox. Vaccination is more rigidly and universally carried out than at any former period. Four deaths were registered from this disease in place of 24 in the year 1867-8, and of 44 in the year 1866-7. The benefits conferred by vaccination can never be too often told and placed before the public; consequently I will give you the narrative of an epidemic of small pox that occurred on board the ship Octavia. A few day's after this ship had left Bombay, where the small pox was rife, the disease broke out. There was a total strength of six hundred and ton, consisting of officers and men. Of these five hundred and eighty-nine had boon vaccinated, whilst the remaining twenty-one had not. Of these vaccinated four hundred and thirty-seven entirely escaped, whilst the one hundred and fifty two who were attacked, suffered lightly and recovered. The twenty-one not vaccinated were all attacked and six died. Those who recovered were more or less disfigured, and their constitutions shattered; besides having passed through a period of weary but needless misery, and being an object of loathsomeness to themselves, and all around. Compared with the eruption of small pox, that which sometimes follows vaccination is utterly unworthy of notice. Small pox is now rare, and its repulsive appearance almost forgotten. Scarlet fever has prevailed during the past year to an unusual extent in the Metropolis, and has proved proportionably fatal. There has occurred in this District an excess of nine deaths over that of the preceding year. Sanitary measures have hitherto exercised but little influence in preventing this disease. It visits the square and the mansion, alike with the court and crowded street. The health of those attacked will modify its mortality; and, hence, the benefit of sanitary measures, as by them the general health will bo improved. Dr. Budd has lately promulgated a plan by which ho says scarlet fever may bo localised, and its spread prevented. To prove the truth of this, further experience will be needed. Anyhow, his proposals could not always be put into operation. Fever has proved fatal in forty-eight cases in this district, whilst in the Metropolis the deaths amounted to 2,483. The deaths registered from this disease in 1864-5, were one hundred and twenty-eight; in 1865-6, fifty-one; in 1866-7, thirty-eight; and in 1867-8, thirty-four. It has now become an unquestioned fact that fever, by which annually in England 35 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1868—1869. "some 15 to 20,000 are killed, and perhaps twenty times that number grievously sickened and endangered," denotes a people badly fed, overcrowded, intemperate, and using for domestic purposes water polluted with excrementitious matter. This last cause, and which is a principal one, is so offensive and disgusting, that no efforts private or public should bo wanting to prevent its continuance. When the cesspool system was in full operation, the riddance of this evil was impossible, but now that cesspools are the exception, and, indeed, only to be met with in some of the better class houses which have escaped the supervision of Vestries, the object is quite capable of being realised. In every case of fever, excrementitious matter should at once be disinfected and removed, and full ventilation maintained. We have hardly recognised the powerful influence of intemperance in the production of fever. In the year 1851 a remarkable diminution of this disease occurred in Edinburgh, and for which no sanitary reason could bo given, inasmuch as no sanitary works in the way of drainage and the like had been done. Intemperance, however, had been marvellously diminished, owing to the operation of "The Forbes Mackenzie Act." Precisely the reverse of this happened in Liverpool. In defiance of sanitary measures which had been carried out in a vast and effective manner, neither money nor labour having been spared, an epidemic of fever broke out and prevailed. Previous however to this outburst, the Free Licensing had come into full practice, and with it a terrible increase of drunkenness. For four years this gigantic experiment was tried, and for four years this disease prevailed, showing no signs of abatement. The Free Licensing was abolished, and with that step the death rate immediately fell, and to a lower degree than it had been for years. I have more than once in my fortnightly reports placed before you the cost which cases of fever have incurred. A calculation has been made of the cost of an epidemic of fever, which continued for three years in Abordoen; and the amount of its cost, lot it be borne in mind, is said to be understated rather than overstated. Aberdeen is a small healthy town, and one not likely to have afforded a field for the spread and duration of fever. There were under treatment 1631 persons, at an average of twenty-five and a half days for each, the amount for which at the moderate rate of 5/- per week came to £4,217: 10: 0. This, with the loss of labour, loss of life and burials, raised the whole sum to £55,021: 4 : 0, "a tax on the inhabitants of something over fifteen shillings per head." But no tax could pay for the suffering, sorrow, and bereavement which was undergone by those who had been afflicted, and who had lost friend and relative. We have had only one case of fever in thirty-six years, said an Eldress of the Shakers in America to Mr. Dixon, and we were very much ashamed of ourselves for having it—it was wholly our own fault.* No doubt can possibly exist that fever is controllable, and might be abolished as it apparently is by the Shakers; but how few practice their exemplary conduct, and how few possess their remedies—"good food and sweet air." In contrast with these, think of our poor with their wretched circumstances without, and unregulated passions within, and little surprise will exist that fever should be absent in the one case, and over present in the other. Hot weather is a great test of the healthiness of towns. A high temperature promotors rapid decomposition, causes great evaporation, and gives life and energy to the lowest ??? of life. The belief now generally prevails that those latter are in some way or ??? connected with epidemic diseases. The heat during the last summer ??? *Hepworth Dixon New America: quoted from Sir J. Simpson's ??? 36 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. degrees above the average of many years—whilst there was a great scarcity of rain, even to the deficiency of 252 tons an acre. Nevertheless the health of London continued remarkably good. And this was doubtless owing to the constant care and watchfulness of Vestries over their various districts. For some weeks during the hottest period, the streets and roads of this district were watered with a weak solution of carbolic acid. Under less favourable sanitary condition, I have no hesitation in saying, that wo should have had some epidemic or other destroying the people. TABLE No. 6. 1864—5 1865—6 1866—7 1867—8 1868-9 Phthisis 181 202 211 184 226 Bronchitis 177 132 165 137 156 Pneumonia 130 119 110 60 80 Constitutional diseases embrace two orders; to the second of which I shall only require your attention, inasmuch as this includes the most fatal of diseases incident to childhood, youth, manhood, and even old age: the names of which are mesenteric disease and consumption. Consumption is the great scourge not only of our country, but that of all others so far as our knowledge extends. "One in every eight persons you meet with in the street is destined to die of it." Its chief victims are the young, the beautiful, and the intellectual. Many of the causes that bring about this disease are outside of our control; and like our proceedings in general, to get rid of these we shall unceasingly struggle, whilst the causes which with a little effort we might readily abolish, we shall continue tamely to submit to. I shall only refer to one now, and that is ventilation. It has lately been discovered that consumption can bo produced by inoculation, and that air saturated with the breath of a consumptive patient is fraught with danger; and what kind of air but this, can be present in a close, ill-ventilated room, which a consumptive patient occupies? The lungs are a broad and open highway for the entrance of many diseases, and to this amongst the rest. The poison may bo so far diluted as to bo innocuous, but this can only be done by allowing the free entrance of fresh air. In-door life is rendered more prejudicial than it would otherwise be, by breathing air which has been breathed before; still there are other evil influences resulting from such a state of life, which would not be obviated by fresh air alone. I was very much surprised to find in reading one of the reports of the papers and discussions thereupon of the "National Association for the Promotion of Social Science," which met at Birmingham, to sec it stated, that nothing effectual could be carried out to stay the diseases arising from want of ventilation owing to the ignorance of the poor. And that it had boon so far almost useless building cottages and lodging houses with good windows, if those who use them would not open them. The poor are not the only class that considers pure air as an enemy. No division present in our social scale but looks upon it as such. There is first ??? of draughts; then, there is the fear of blacks which plentifully float in the atmosthirty-??? and fouling everything upon which they drop, and the dust that oftentimes 37 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Heallh—1868—9. darkens our roads and streets, and which enters every open space and crevice, damaging stock and furniture: hence every contrivance possible is used to prevent the entrance of air with which these substances are unfortunately mingled. Sir Francis Head, after describing a ball room in which are assembled "a dense phalanx, of both sexes, amongst whom are conspicuous persons of the highest rank, beauty, and wealth in Europe," asks, what is the state of the atmosphere these grandees are breathing? "If any one will take the trouble," he answers, "to put five hundred beautiful little gold and silver fishes into a bladder of the filthiest water he can obtain, and then attaching a weight throw the whole into a clear, crystal, stream, he may justly say,—aye, and he may grin as he says it,—Behold an epitome of a London drawing-room." It has been proved that there annually takes place in England and Wales "an excess of upwards of 50,000 deaths, which are largely influenced by the bad ventilation and overcrowding of ill-constructed schools." What is the state of this Hall at this moment with regard to ventilation? There are no means whatever for this purpose, except by the windows, and they are kept rigidly closed. Let us hear no more then of the ignorance and prejudice of the poor; the poor are not one whit more so, than any other class. There was a time, and that not long ago, when ventilation would have proved as great an evil as the want of it; and that time was, when the air which came in was saturated with gases given off from open ditches, filthy streets, grave-yards and cesspools. That now is no longer the case. We should remember, that the air wo breathe is as much our food, as the solids wo eat, and the liquids wo drink, and as much care should bo taken that it bo free from adulteration. Mesenteric disease destroyed seventy nine children, three more than in the preceding year; and hydrocephalus destroyed twenty, two less than in the period mentioned. In the class called Local Diseases, arc included those of the four great systems of the body, namely, diseases of the brain and nerves, heart, lungs, and bowels. Hitherto, there has been a gradual increase of deaths from diseases of the brain; in the year 1868-9 there was a decrease of six, comparing it with that of 1867-8. Convulsions have been fatal to ton more children, having caused one hundred and seventeen deaths. Diseases of the heart have been more fatal, and to the extent of fourteen deaths; the same has happened from diseases of the lungs and digestive organs; the former by an increase of forty, and the latter by an increase of eight. Thirty-five deaths were attributed to premature birth and debility. Six infants came to an untimely end from accidental suffocation, their ages ranging from ton weeks to eight months. Two males were run over, aged six and ten years. A male, aged 49, was killed from falling off a ladder; a female, aged 70, from falling over a hoop; and another, aged 47, fell on her face in the street and was suffocated. A male infant was scalded to death by upsetting upon himself a pot of boiling tea. A new born infant was found dead in Level's Low, with fractured skull. Five persons hung themselves, all males, the youngest 28, and the oldest 82 years old. A male and female cut their throats, aged 60 and 30 years. A female, aged 34 years, poisoned herself with oil of bitter almonds. A female died from injury to the bowels, caused by the ill-treatment of her husband, who was found guilty of manslaughter. A female died in Clarence Street, aged 94 years; and another in Waterloo Road, aged 95. 38 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. TABLE No. 7. NAME. OF WATER COMPANY. TONS.

We have a right to demand water free from sowage contamination, whether shown by analysis or not; and, whilst it may bo quite true as stated by Mr. Hawkesley, that river water becomes quito potable at a few miles from whence "immense quantities of sowago" have been poured in, yet, it would bo much more agreeable, and more in accordance with the fitness of things, that no sowago should be poured in at a few miles, nor at many miles distant from the source whence the water is drawn. "By a whole host of terrible diseases, God forbids the consumption of contaminated waters." The water with which London is supplied is impure in quality and insufficient in quantity. But compared with what it was only a few years back, our advantage is great. ,,"We have in the course of the yoar had occasion to remove persons affectod with fever, to the Fever Hospital, against the will of these to whom they belonged. This was only done, when having regard to the benefit of these afflicted, and the safety of the neighbourhood, there was an absolute necessity; but which necessity doubtless appeared an act of cruelty. This power possessed by the Vestry is one, which, should bo exercised with the greatest discretion, and with the utmost regard to the feelings of these concerned. And, in a few cases, owing to the crowded state and condition of rooms in which bodies lay, wo have been compelled to remove them to the Workhouse Mortuary: when this has been done, there has always followed the necessity of the Parish burying them, which would not have been the case, had they not been removed. The Bake-houses and Slaughter-houses have been visited according to the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act, and the Bako-house Regulation Act.

It marks out the dark spots of the District, placing as it were the finger upon them, and demanding attention; and they will long demand attention, and not get it. Great changes will have taken place, and the present race of Vestrics will have been swept away and forgotten, before that most of all important duties is practised, namely, housing aright the poor, and in a measure commensurate with the necessity. There are probably in the Metropolis 500,000 working men who are improperly lodged. I am glad to see that this unhappy state of things is beginning to excite more general attention, and that the Clergy think it worthy of their notice and exposure. The Rev. C. II. Spurgeon in a book just published, entitled "John Ploughman's Talk," thus writes upon the subject:— "I would not choose to own half the cottages poor labourers are made to live in: no farmer would be so mean as to keep his horses in them; and they are not good enough for dog kennels. Think of Father, and Mother, and a grownup Son, and two Daughters sleeping in the same room It is a burning shame, and a crying sin on the part of those who drive people to such shifts. It won't bear to be thought of, and yet it is not at all uncommon. Squires and Landlords, how would you like it ? If any man defends such a system, half-an-hour's hanging would be a good thing for him." The writer need not have gone to the cottages of England for illustration; the case is verified in hundreds and hundreds of instances around him, and all over London. Before a Coroner's Inquest held some time ago over a child, whoso death was attributed to " blood poisoning," the Father thus described his dwelling, "The room is not fit for a dog to live in, but I am obliged to live in it., because I cannot afford to pay more than eighteen pence a week for rent, which is what I pay for it.". What is the answer given by Dr. Gairdner, Annual Report of the Officer of health—1868—1869. 41 Medical Officer of Health, of Glasgow, to the inquiry of the alarmed inhabitants of that City, as to the cause of the excessive mortality during the last quarter, in one week of which the death-rate had risen to 47 deaths in 1000 persons living? Why that it was owing "especially to the low standard of domestic comfort, the overcrowding, general squalor, and physical degradation of a large section of the population; and these, again, are the direct results of permitting generation after generation to be brought up in houses of the worst construction, in which morality, decency, and cleanliness, are alike impossiable''. Here,then, then, is the evil, or at least the most prominent evil, that now influonces Our social condition, and that fully accounts for the presence of fevor, and our high morality, and the one to which all our endeavours should be strenuously exercised to remove. If a man can only pay eighteen pence a week for rent, and for which ho has a kennel, what can he do? He can produce fever, and distribute it broadcast over the neighbourhood; which he diligently does. Fever is sown; fever springs up, and is gathered, and wo stand amazed at the result. We might stand amazed at any other result, I think. Unfortunately in the building of houses for the poor—and I mean the poor—there is no scope for the genius of the architect; and no occasion is afforded for a grand exhibition at the laying of the foundation stone, and yet is there no greater occasion offered for both when the end is , Considered. The erection of Palatial Hospitals may offer gain and glory to the architect, whilst their foundation stones may be laid by the Highest in the Land, yet their object is not to prevent sickness, but merely to euro it—a very inferior department. Suitable human abitations would tend to lessen the need for Hospitals, and it should bo our aim to disp???se with them. Indeed, when sickness and death comes, what more fit and appropriate than that it should find the sufferer in the midst of his family, and that these should be about him who are nearest and dearest to him. The time may come when Hospitals shall stand as monuments of the misapplication of wealth. Little headway has however as yet made in this direction. It behoves these who are possessed of wealth and knowledge. nay, it is their bounden duty to further with all the power and influence they can command the sanitary cause. I had rath see it progress by moral means than by legal means; from willingness within, than from force without. Moral apathy cannot be radically changed by physical coercion. "When wo see what can be done by the energy and unwearied zeal of our churches to civilize and house the black savage, sunely something might be done, more than has ever yet been done to civilize and house the white savage, who is jostling us on every side, and fast becoming a fear and dread to the land. "Where is the landlord who is spending his money not in pineries and hot houses, but in schools and wash houses and drains; who is less intent on the magnificence of his own grand house than in providing cottages where drainage is possible ?" A landlord might do both, and to do both might be his duty. "Whilst building his mansion and pineries, he might also at the same time build schools and wash houses. Doing one docs not necessarily involve neglect in doing the other. But his first care ought to be for the necessities of these over whom by Providence ho has been made overseer. His luxuries might wait. The physical condition of man has been too little cared for. A degraded race will of necessity be a criminal race. In the faces of our hardened malefactors may their characters bo traced. It was justly observed by one of the Presidents of the Public Health Sections of the Social Sciencee Association, who when some onesaid to him that we should think much more of the sold than of the body, replied, That the samo God who made the soul made the body also; and 42 Parish, of St. George the Martyr, Southward. that it was His work, and that it must be treated and cared for according to title end for which it was formed—fitness for His service. A country inhabited by an ailing, diseased, hypochondriacal population would bo both helpless and useless; and not likely to excite other the respect, or the fear, or the gratitude, of other nations ; but would only claim to bo trodden down and stamped out as a nuisance from off the face of the earth. Sir J. G. Simpson, M.D., however, in the spirit of prophecy beholds a far brighter and happier prospect: he says, that a period will arrive when we shall be able to stay the ravages of consumption, blot out-fevers and inflammation, cure cancer, destroy all morbific germ, annul the deadly influences of malaria and contagions; when our hygienic condition and laws shall have been changed so as to forbid all communicable diseases from being spread, and remove all causes of sickness that are removable; and when the rapidly increasing length of human life shall begin to fulfil that ancient prophecy, "the child shall die a hundred years old." We shall never Bee that day, but we may help to assure and hasten on its advent. HENRY BATESON, M.D. June 8th, 1869. 43 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1868—9.
