TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London for the year 1928. Dr. W. M. Willoughby, who had occupied the position of Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London from February, 1916, was, on the 17th May, appointed Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, but continued to act in the former capacity until the 17th September, when I had the honour of entering upon my duties in your service. The tonnage of vessels entering the Port of London during 1928 was 27,741,734, showing an increase of 1,529,111 tons over that for the year 1927. Of the 15,936 vessels arriving from foreign ports, your Medical Officers actually boarded 1,849 at Gravesend and 181 at Sheerness, making a total of 2,030 vessels boarded. This is an increase of 316 over the number of vessels boarded in 1927. The practice of hailing all vessels from " foreign " was continued throughout the year. 75,501 passengers and 57,173 members of crews were examined. These figures also are considerably in excess of those for the previous year. The number of cases of illness reported on by the Medical Officers was 824, and, although this was 42 less than the previous year, the number of cases removed to Denton Hospital for Infectious Diseases was 75, which was 28 more than in the previous year. No case of human Plague arrived in the Port, but six Plague-infected rats were found in one vessel, details of which are given on page 14. No Plague infection of the shore rat population occurred. Eight vessels from which cases of Small-pox had been removed arrived, but no actual case was found on vessels in the Port. The fumigation of vessels for the destruction of rats has increased considerably in recent years, and during the year under review 180 vessels were fumigated for; this purpose, as against 136 in 1927. Altogether, 279 Certificates were issued during the year in respect of measures of rat destruction on vessels. The Sanitary Inspectors made 15,951 inspections of vessels and 6,341 inspections of shore premises during the year. Orders to cleanse crew's quarters were made on 1,391 vessels, and it was found necessary to order structural alterations and repairs on 299 vessels. Orders to remedy structural defects were made in respect of 67 shore premises. Forty-six statutory notices were served, as shown in Appendix XXXVI. Twentv infringements of the Bye-laws relating to offensive cargoes were reported, and intimation notices were sent to the offenders, but no legal proceedings were taken. The carrying out of the provisions of the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, formed an important part of the work of the Authority. During the latter part of the year mutton imported from Australia and South America was found to be extensively affected with Caseous Lymphadenitis, and examination of the whole of the mutton from those sources became necessary. Had this been attempted in the docks, serious delay and expense to trade would have resulted; therefore, as an alternative, arrangements were made with the Medical Officers of Health for the City of London and certain Metropolitan Boroughs to undertake the examination of whole consignments in Cold Stores in their districts. Ten percent. of the consignments for provincial towns were retained in Dock Stores for examination by your Inspectors, the residue being allowed to proceed on receipt of guarantees that such mutton would not be removed from provincial cold stores until it had been examined by the Medical Officer of Health concerned. The Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended. In only one case was it necessary to take legal proceedings. 9 I.—AMOUNT OF SHIPPING ENTERING THE PORT DURING THE YEAR 1928. Table A. Number. Tonnage. Number By the Medical Officer of Health.

(b) Cargo Traffic:— Principal Imports—Merchandise of all kinds, principally Provisions, Fruit, Grain and Flour, Hides and Skins, Meat, Oil and Fats, Rubber, Textile Materials, Tobacco, Wood and Wool. Principal Exports—Manufactured Goods of all kinds. Countries with which the Port principally trades—The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. III.—SOURCE OF WATER SUPPLY. Inasmuch as the Port of London from West to East extends for a distance of nearly 69 miles and passes through the following Counties:— On the North Bank, Middlesex, London and Essex, On the South Bank, Surrey, London and Kent, it necessarily follows that there are various sources of water supply. The warehouses and offices in the docks, all of which are within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, are practically all supplied direct from mains. Shipping in the docks is chiefly supplied with water direct from mains on shore. 10 In some cases, however, for instance where vessels are not lying near a dock quay, water is supplied from water barges which have obtained their supplies from water mains on the dock premises. Vessels lying in the Eiver obtain their supplies direct from water mains on shore or from water barges. The number of water barges in use in the Port of London during the year was 17; one of these was withdrawn temporarily, and one which had previously been withdrawn resumed working, leaving 17 in use at the end of the year. The barges were inspected periodically, and no signs of contamination of the water contained in them were discovered. These craft must be registered by the Port of London Authority. Eegistration must be renewed annually, and is dependent on the vessels proving on inspection to be fit for navigation in the Port. Much better control of water barges could be exercised if re-registration by the Port of London Authority depended also on the barges being found on inspection to be entirely satisfactory for the purpose of carrying drinking water. Water—Sample taken for Analysis. On arrival of the Mv. "Katerndicht" at Sheerness, from Batoum, on the 23rd August, the master reported that several seamen had complained of sickness, diarrhoea and pains in the abdomen. The crew were examined by the Boarding Medical Officer and found to be well. The master stated that he "did not like the taste of the water," and at his request a sample was submitted to an analyst for bacteriological examination. The result of the examination was as follows:— " Bacteriological examination by cultural and microscopical methods on the 24/8/28 gave the following results :— B. Ooli, present in 25 c.c. Streptococci, not found in 20 c.c. B. Enteritidisis Sporogenes present in 10 c.c." The water is seen to contain a high count of organisms, together with evidence of excremental pollution, though organisms of the typhoid-paratyphoid group or other definitely pathogenic bacteria were not detected. The findings suggest that the ship's tank should receive a thorough cleaning." The tanks were emptied and cleaned, and fresh water was taken in at Gravesend. IV.—INFECTIOUS DISEASE. For the detection of infectious disease on vessels arriving from foreign ports it is necessary to provide for vessels :— (1) Proceeding up the Eiver Thames. (2) Proceeding up the Eiver Medway. In respect of vessels proceeding up the Eiver Thames, the Port Sanitary Authority maintains a hulk moored in the Eiver, off Gravesend, about twenty-six miles below London Bridge, on which a Medical Officer is always on duty, day and night. The Customs Boarding Station is also at Gravesend, and the Port Medical Officer accompanies the Customs Officer, who visits by launch all vessels from "foreign." Although no arrangements have been made for the notification by wireless to the Port Sanitary Authority of the time of arrival of inward vessels requiring special attention, advance information is frequently given to the Authority by shipowners and others who have been in wireless communication with such ships. 11 All vessels from foreign ports are visited by a Medical Officer in the Customs launch in Gravesend Reach. The questions are put by the Customs Officer, and the answers made by the masters are heard by the Medical Officer, who boards any vessel ori which sickness is reported to have occurred and makes such enquiries and examinations as are indicated. Ships from ports in the Eastern Hemisphere, South of latitude 45° N. (except European ports West of longitude 20° E.), and ships from ports in the Western Hemisphere, South of latitude 30° N., are considered as from "infected ports," and are boarded and examined, whatever the report. Ports, or rather coast-lines containing ports, are added or exempted according to reports of the distribution of infection. Medical examination under this system, whether in spite of a negative or because of a positive report of illness, has from time to time led to the detection of serious conditions of infection. Cases of infectious disease on incoming vessels are removed in the Port Sanitary Authority's motor launch to the Authority's hospital for infectious diseases, which is situated on the river bank at Denton, just below Gravesend. In cases where it is deemed advisable, immediate contacts are also removed from the vessels to hospital for observation, or for bathing and disinfection of personal effects. In some cases, e.g., vessels on which Plague or Small-pox has occurred, the names and addresses of. all the passengers and crews are taken, and forwarded with the necessary information to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which they are proceeding. The vessels come again under scrutiny by a Sanitary Inspector while in the Port, special attention being given to those from infected ports or on which suspicious circumstances have occurred during the voyage. Disinfection of infected quarters is generally commenced by the Authority's Staff before the vessel proceeds up the River, the method employed being the fumigation with S02, followed by washing down with "Izal." Infected bedding, clothing, &c., is removed by launch to the Authority's hospital and disinfected by steam (see Appendices XXV. to XXVII. inclusive). Vessels proceeding up the River Medway are dealt with by a part-time Medical Officer from Sheerness, whose duty it is to visit, as soon as possible, every vessel on which sickness is reported by H.M. Customs, and to board within about twelve hours of arrival every vessel from "foreign" remaining within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. Cases of infectious disease on such vessels would be removed to the Port Sanitary Authority's Hospital (see Appendix XXVIII.). No special arrangements have been made for cleansing of persons. Three motor launches are available for transport of cases of infectious disease occurring within the Port. The detection of venereal disease generally results from questioning the masters and surgeons of vessels and the examination of crews mustered for examination at the request of the Medical Officer. Handbills showing where free treatment can be obtained by seamen are distributed on vessels. Bacteriological examinations of rats, &c., are carried out for the Authority by arrangements with the Seamen's Hospital Society at their Hospital in the Royal Albert Dock.

Venereal Diseases and other non-notifiable sickness, see Appendices XXIII. and XXIV. Plague. The ss. "Nankin" arrived at Gravesend on the 29th March, 1928, from Calcutta. The vessel left London on the 9th January, 1928, on the outward voyage, calling at Port Said, Port Sudan and Aden. On arrival at Aden, on the 26th January, three native firemen joined the vessel out of hospital (convalescent). One of these natives (convalescing from Small-pox) had a temperature on joining the ship, but appeared to be well; later he developed a headache and malaise, became rapidly worse and died on the 29th January. The body was buried at sea; all personal effects and bedding were thrown overboard and the hospital fumigated with sulphur dioxide. The immediate contacts were landed at Colombo on 3rd February, and the native quarters fumigated. The two other firemen who joined the vessel with the deceased were landed at Calcutta, well. There was no history of any mortality among the rats on board, and no other case occurred. 13 Reported occurrence of Pneumonic Plague on board the ss. "Automedon." Previous Information: (1) The Weekly Record of Infectious Diseases at Ports, &c., No. 482, for week ending 24th October, 1928, contained information that a Chinese fireman had been landed from ss. "Automedon" at Penang, on 18th October, suffering from Pneumonic Plague, and that the diagnosis had been confirmed bacteriologically. (2) The London Agents of Messrs. Alfred Holt & Co., Liverpool, wrote on 9th November to the effect that they understood that a Chinese fireman had been left in hospital at Penang suffering from Pneumonic Plague, and asking what steps the London Port Sanitary Authority would require to take on arrival of the ss. "Automedon" in the River. Arrival of Vessel in Port of London: The ss. "Automedon" arrived off Gravesend about 7 a.m. on 14th November, and was immediately boarded by the Medical Officer, who ascertained that a Chinese fireman—Wong Fu Shu—was taken ill on 16th October. The ship's surgeon diagnosed Lobar Pneumonia on the left side. On 18th October, when the vessel arrived at Penang, the Port Medical Officer of Health saw the case, confirmed the diagnosis, and sent the patient to hospital, with his bedding and effects. The crew's quarters aft were disinfected by the ship's surgeon. On 20th October, the ss. "Automedon " being then at sea, a wireless message was received from Penang that the case landed there was one of Pneumonic Plague. On 22nd October the vessel arrived at Colombo, where news was received that the patient was still alive and progressing. The vessel was apparently not treated as an infected or suspected ship, though the crew's quarters aft were fumigated with sulphur dioxide. The vessel proceeded through the Suez Canal without being subjected to any special treatment. No other cases of sickness occurred during the voyage. After medical inspection at Gravesend the vessel was searched, as far as possible, by a Sanitary Inspector for sick or dead rats, the hatches being removed, but none were found. The ship then proceeded to her berth in the King George V. Dock, where she was moored to the pontoons. Rat guards were placed on the mooring ropes from the ship end, and the ropes were tarred from the shore end. A rat-searcher was put on board and a rat-catcher employed. Shortly after noon on the 14th November your Medical Officer received a cable, as follows:— "Suspected Plague ex ss. 'Automedon ' unconfirmed. "Port Health Officer, Penang." On receipt of this telegram, and in view of the account of the case and of the subsequent history of the vessel, it was deemed unnecessary to regard the vessel as a "suspected ship." At the same time, the vessel was carefully searched for sick or dead rats, and an effort was made to trap live rats for bacteriological examination. The sick man signed on with the rest of the Chinese crew at Shanghai on 24th August, 3 928. From 8th to 15th October the ss. "Automedon" was lying at Singapore, and on 16th October she anchored at Port Swettenham for 24 hours. It was on 16th October that the patient reported sick with high temperature and rusty sputum. It certainly appears that the original diagnosis of Lobar Pneumonia is more likely to have been correct than that of Pneumonic Plague. So far as your Medical Officer can ascertain, this view was taken at Suez. In spite of repeated search and continued trapping, no specimens of rats were obtained for bacteriological examination. The vessel appeared to be free of rats. 14 On 17th November the ss. "Automedon" sailed with part cargo for Rotterdam and Hamburg. The Port Medical Officer of Rotterdam had previously telegraphed for particulars of the sanitary measures applied in the Port of London, and your Medical Officer communicated to him the necessary information. Rodent Plague on ss. "Kaisar-I-Hind." The above vessel arrived in the Port of London on 19th January, from Bombay, On 24th January eight dead rats were found in Nos. 2, 3 and 5 holds, but, being badly decomposed, were destroyed. Late the next day another dead rat was found in No. 5 hold; this was sent immediately for bacteriological examination. On 26th January a further seven dead rats were found in Nos. 3 and 5 holds and a live rat was trapped in No. 3 hold; these were also sent for bacteriological examination. The bacteriologist reported that six of the eight dead rats submitted to him were infected with Plague. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Ministry of Health. Steps were immediately taken to prevent the passage of rats from the ship to the shore, and on 28th January the vessel, being then empty, was fumigated throughout with hydrocyanic acid gas. No human case occurred, and there was no extension of the rodent infection to the shore rat population. Cholera. The ss. "Manipur" arrived at Gravesend on the 11th August, from Calcutta, having landed a native fireman to hospital at Vizagapatam on the 20th August, suffering from Cholera. The patient's personal effects and bedding were taken ashore at Vizagapatam and disinfected, and the ship fumigated on arrival at Marseilles. The ship's drinking water was chlorinated at Vizagapatam and Suez. No other case occurred. The ss. "Clan MacBean," from Buenos Aires and Calcutta, arrived at Gravesend on the 1st September, having landed one of the crew at Calcutta suffering from Cholera. The source of infection was thought to be ice cream. The vessel was fumigated and all infected bedding destroyed at Calcutta. The water, on testing, was found to be free from contamination. No other case occurred. The ss. "Glenapp" arrived at Gravesend on the 9th December, from Yokohama. On the arrival of the vessel at Yokohama on the 27th September the master, chief officer and carpenter were examined, and landed to hospital as suspected cases of Cholera. The master and the carpenter recovered and returned to the ship. The chief officer, however, was released from the Quarantine Hospital and removed to the General Hospital, where the case was diagnosed as Typhoid Fever. Information was received later that the chief officer died in hospital at Yokohama. Full quarantine measures were taken in Yokohama, and all precautions carried out on board. No other case occurred. Small-pox. On arrival of the ss. "Clan Buchanan" at Gravesend, on the 7th January, 1928, it was ascertained that a native fireman reported sick on the 19th November, 1927. He was examined by the Port Medical Officer at Chittagong and isolated. On the 20th November a rash appeared on the patient's body, and he was again seen by the Port Medical Officer, who diagnosed Small-pox (mild). The patient was admitted to the Isolation Hospital at Chittagong; the crew's quarters were disinfected, and the bedding and all personal effects of the native crew were taken ashore and disinfected. Vaccination of the master and all members of the crew was carried out immediately. The crew's quarters and bedding were disinfected on arrival of the vessel at Buirlipatam on the 26th November, and at Coconada on 2nd December. No further case occurred. The ss. "Kota-Inten" arrived at Gravesend on the 15th February, 1928,, having landed a case of Small-pox at Jeddah on the 30th January. The case, a child of 4 vears, was one of the many pilgrims carried by this vessel. The patient was isolated on board, together with its parents, and was convalescent on landing at Jeddah. All beds, blankets, &c., were thrown overboard and the infected quarters disinfected by the ship's doctor. No further case occurred. 15 The ss. “ City of Canterbury,” from Calcutta, arrived at Gravesend on the 26(h February, having landed a Goanese steward at Colombo on the 30th January, suffering from suspected Small.pox. The diagnosis of Small.pox was not definitely confirmed on the case being examined ashore. The patient's personal effects were landed with him; all infected bedding was destroyed, and the infected quarters fumigated by the Sanitary Authority at Colombo. No other case occurred. On the 18th May a letter was received from Hartlepool enclosing a copy of a letter from the Medical Officer of Health for South Shields, stating that one of the crew of the ss. “ Redriff “ had been notified as suffering from Small.pox—onset, 11th May; rash, 15th May. The patient left his ship at Hartlepool on the 11th May, as he thought he had “ rheumatism.“ It was also stated that he had probably contracted the infection from his son and wife, who had also been notified as suffering from the disease. Enquiries were made of the owners of the vessel, and it was ascertained that the vessel would be berthing at Eotherhithe on the 18th instant. Instructions were issued for the crew to be retained on board until seen by your Acting Medical Officer. The vessel was visited at 2 p.m. on the 18th instant, and the crew of nineteen (19) were offered vaccination. All save two (2) were vaccinated. The bedding and effects of the contacts were removed to Denton Hospital for disinfection, and the vessel fumigated with sulphur and washed down with “ Izal ” solution. The vessel left for the Tyne on the 19th instant, the Medical Officer for the Tyne being notified of the circumstances by telegram and subsequently by letter. The ss. “ Mashobra ” arrived at Gravesend on the 10th April, having landed a native member of the crew at Madras suffering from Small.pox. The contacts with the case (60 in number) were re.vaccinated on discovery of the case. All the infected bedding and effects were destroyed at Madras and disinfection carried out. No other case occurred. The ss. “ Glenamoy,” from Vladivostock, arrived at Gravesend on the 19th April. An engineer, suffering from Small.pox, was landed at Singapore, where the whole of the crew were vaccinated and the ship disinfected. No other case occurred. The ss. “ Kashgar ” arrived at Gravesend on the 16th June, from Yokohama, having landed one of the crew to hospital at Kobe, suffering from Small.pox. All infected bedding was taken ashore and disinfected by the Japanese Port Authority, with the exception of the patient's mattress, which was burned in the ship's furnace. The infected cabin was fumigated and washed down with carbolic solution. The Goanese stewards and the second wireless operator were vaccinated by the Japanese Port Authority, and the remainder of the crew, except those showing marks of recent vaccination, by the ship's surgeon. No other case occurred. The ss. “ Antenor ” arrived at Gravesend on the 19th July, from Dalny, having landed a member of the European crew at Taku Bar, suffering from Small.pox. The whole of the crew were vaccinated and the infected quarters disinfected. No other case occurred. Enteric Fever. On the loth Mav a telephone message was received from the Blue Star Line (1920), Ltd., to the effect that the Captain of the ss. “ Arandora ” had wired advice of five cases of Enteric Fever amongst the crew of the vessel. The vessel duly arrived at Gravesend, from Buenos Aires, on the 17th May, and was met by the Boarding Medical Officer in the Lower Reach, and the cases were removed to the Hospital of this Authority at Denton. 16 The patients, with approximate dates of onset of the disease, are as follows:— 1. A Cook. 3rd May, 1928. 2. Greaser. 6th Mav, 1928 (also suffering from double pneumonia). 3. „ 7th May, 1928. 4. Scullion. 7th May, 1928. 5. Greaser. 13th May, 1928. The ports of call, with dates, are as follows:— Outward voyage— Homeward voyage— March 26. Victoria Dock.* April 27. Monte Video. April 1. Lisbon.* „ 30. Santos * „ 2. Madeira.* May 1. Rio de Janeiro. „ 12. Rio de Janeiro.* „ 9. St. Vincent. „ 25. Buenos Aires * „11. Madeira.* (Baracas BocaV „ 13. Lisbon.* Water was taken in at those ports marked thus *. The water tanks were cleaned out in London before the voyage. The whole of the infected bedding, effects, &c., were removed to Denton Hospital for steam disinfection, and the infected quarters on the vessel were washed down and fumigated. The place of infection seems to have been Baracas Boca, where the vessel remained for about six days, during which time the crew went ashore. V.—MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS. (1) Steps taken for detection of rodent Plague:— (a) In ships in the Port. It is the duty of Inspectors to make a close examination during the discharge of cargo from ships arriving from foreign ports for signs of any mortality among the rats on board. Such mortality, if present, may be found on the opening of hatches or only when the cargo has been partly or even completely discharged. (b) On quays, wharves, warehouses, &c., in the vicinity of the Port. A similar strict watch for rat mortality is kept on the quays and warehouses of the docks. Rats are sent for bacteriological examination to the Seamen's Hospital, Royal Albert Dock, London. An examination of spleen smears is a routine practice in the absence of mortality. With a mortality, closer examination is directed. No rodent Plague has occurred on shore for twelve years. Wharves and warehouses on the riverside, apart from the docks, are not in the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. (2) Measures taken to prevent the passage of rats between ships and shore:— All vessels from ports where rodent Plague is known or suspected to be present are required to have rat guards placed on all mooring ropes. In special cases vessels are also required to be breasted off from the shore, to have the mooring ropes parcelled and tarred as well as being guarded by metal discs, and the gangway either fitted with a rat.proof door or lifted at night and when not in use. Any lighters used in the discharge of the cargo must be removed from the ship's side between dusk and daylight. (3) Methods of deratisation of:— (a) Ships. The methods employed for the deratisation of ships are: Sulphur, burned, 3 lbs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space; shortest period of exposure, six hours. Hydrocyanic acid, by liquid method or by “ Zyklon ’ B ’ ” method; concentration, 0'2 per cent.; shortest period of exposure, two hours. (b) Premises in the vicinity of docks and quays. Trapping and poisoning are constantly employed by the Port of London Authority and other owners and occupiers of premises within the Port Sanitary District, supervision being exercised by officers of the Port Sanitary Authority. 17 (4) Measures taken for the detection of rat prevalence in ships and on shore:— Examination by Inspectors. (5) Rat.proofing:— (a) Very steady rat.proofing of the docks and warehouses is in progress, and has already led to a very marked reduction in the shore rat population of the Port. (b) Action taken to extend rat.proofing:— (i.) The chief Shipping Companies using the Port of London have been circulated as to the benefits and nature of rat.proofing of ships. (ii.) The Port of London Authority is fully alive to the importance of rat.proofing of shore premises, and is carrying out a very full programme of work in this direction. Rats Destroyed during 1928.

During the last part of the year, owing to the fact that Australian and South American mutton was found to be extensively affected with the disease Caseous Lymphadenitis, it became necessary to exercise greater control over this meat in the' Port of London. Briefly, the system adopted was as follows:— London destinations.—Whole parcels of mutton, including tegs, were allowed to go forward, under guarantee, to stores within the districts of the City of London and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bermondsey, Southwark, Stepney, Poplar, Greenwich and Finsbury, the Medical Officer of Health for each district being notified accordingly. Provincial destinations.—Ten per cent, of each mark was detained in dock stores for examination by your officers, the balance of parcels being released under guarantee when applied for. 23 The following carcases, &c., were examined by officers of the Port of London Sanitary Authority up to 31st December, 1928:— Quantity examined. Number found to be Diseased. 14,505 Carcases 608 Carcases. 10 Haunches 2 Haunches. 11 Saddles 1 Saddle. 120 Shoulders 2 Shoulders. 1 Hind Quarter 1 Hind Quarter. 1 Fore Quarter 1 Fore Quarter. 3 Legs 3 Legs. A close inspection of mutton will continue until it is found that a reliable examination is being carried out in the country of origin.

During the year each Sanitary Inspector was appointed as both an Official Sampler and an Inspector under the Act, these appointments being approved by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. Your Worshipful Committee combined with the Sanitary Committee in appointing Mr. E. A. Pinchin, Public Analyst in the City of London, as Agricultural Analyst, the appointment being approved by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. No samples were taken during the year. NEW LEGISLATION. The Infectious Diseases (London) Regulations, 1927. The Infectious Diseases (London) Regulations were issued to Local Authorities, and a definite obligation was laid upon the Port Sanitary Authority to acquaint all medical practitioners, resident or practising within the area, of the duties imposed upon them by the Regulations, which became operative on the 1st January last. The Regulations revoke the Public Health (Pneumonia, Malaria, Dysentery, &c.) Regulations, 1919, which were issued to make provision against a number of infectious diseases, such as Dysentery, Trench Fever and Malaria, which it was feared might be introduced into this country by soldiers and others returning from overseas. The precautions possible under the Regulations doubtless contributed to the low incidence of these diseases. Their provisions, after review and amendment, are now issued as a fresh set of Regulations. One of the most apparent alterations is the removal of Trench Fever from the list of diseases which are notifiable. One important addition has been made with regard to Malaria. Previously there was no legal obligation to report cases of Malaria induced in an Institution, as a method of treatment for other conditions. Although such cases are still not required to be notified, the practitioner in charge of the case, if of the opinion that the patient is liable to relapses of Malaria, shall notify the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the patient proposes to reside at least four days before his discharge from the Institution. The duties of the Medical Officer of Health are similar to those laid down in the revoked Regulations. In Malaria endeavours are to be made to obtain material for microscopic examination, and to ensure that the patient is supplied with the necessary quinine treatment, &c. In Typhus and Relapsing Fever provision is made for the destruction of lice. In Enteric Fever and Dysentery steps must be taken to protect food or drink for human consumption against contamination by the patient or by a carrier. In this connection the affected person may be prevented from following his occupation, and provision is made for appropriate compensation. 26 INTERNATIONAL SANITARY CONVENTION OF PARIS, 1926. This Convention, which supersedes the previous Convention of 1912, was signed in Paris on the 21st June, 1926, but did not come into force until ratified by ten of the High Contracting Parties. The Official English Text has recently been issued by the Foreign Office. Some of the principal points affecting the Port Sanitary Authority are:— (1) An undertaking is given that all possible means will be taken to diminish the danger of the spread of Plague by rats, and that the condition of the rats in the. port, as regards Plague will be ascertained by frequent and regular bacteriological examinations. (2) An undertaking is given to maintain in the port a sanitary service possessing an organisation and equipment capable of carrying out the application of the prophylactic measures in regard to Cholera, Plague, Yellow Fever, Typhus and Small.pox. (3) Any vessel, on arrival in the port, may be subjected to medical examination, but subsequent sanitary measures must be determined by the actual conditions found to exist on board and the medical history of the voyage. (4) The action that may be taken in regard to merchandise and baggage coming from districts infected with Cholera, Plague, Typhus or Small.pox is prescribed, e.g., merchandise coming from an infected local area and liable to harbour Plague.infected rats may be unloaded only on condition that the precautions necessary to prevent the escape of rats and to ensure their destruction are taken as far as practicable. (5) The methods of disinfection, deratisation, &c., which are adopted are left to the discretion of the Port Sanitary Authority, but they must be carried out in such a fashion as to injure articles as little as possible, and charges for such services must be in accordance with a Sanitary Tariff made public beforehand, and so drawn up that the State and the Sanitary Authority may not, on the whole, derive any profit from their application. (6) The definition of a Plague.infected ship is extended to include one on which Plague. infected rats are found; and a vessel is regarded as Plague.suspected when investigation has shown the existence of an unusual rat mortality without determining the cause thereof. (7) Provision is made for the deratisation of Plague.infected or suspected ships before the discharge of cargo if the Port Sanitary Authority is of the opinion, having regard to the nature of the cargo and the way in which it is loaded, that it is possible to effect a total destruction of rats before discharge. (8) All foreign.going ships must be inspected by officers of the Port Sanitary Authority at intervals of six months as to their condition in regard to the number of rats on board. If there are more than a minimum number of rats on board any vessel, deratisation must be carried out under the supervision and control of the Port Sanitary Authority, who must then issue a Deratisation Certificate. If, on the other hand, any vessel is found to be so maintained that the rat population is reduced to a minimum, a Deratisation Exemption Certificate must be granted. Deratisation and Exemption Certificates are valid for six months. (9) The Port Sanitary Authority are required to take all requisite and practicable measures to secure the destruction of rats in the port and its surroundings, as well as on lighters and coastwise vessels. (10) In regard to Cholera, cases presenting the clinical symptoms of Cholera must be treated as cases of Cholera even if no vibrios or only atypical vibrios are found, but if a ship has been declared infected or suspected on account of clinical cases only, and two bacteriological examinations at intervals of not less than twenty.four hours have given definitely negative results, the ship must be declared healthy. (11) The emptying of water ballast in port without previous disinfection may be prohibited if it has been taken in at a Cholera.infected port. (12) The sanitary measures which may be taken in regard to a ship on which a case of Typhus has occurred are prescribed, including delousing of persons and their effects and the parts of the ship which have been occupied by them. (13) The sanitary measures which may be taken in regard to a ship on which a case of Small.pox has occurred are prescribed. (14) It is recommended that there be provided in large seaports:— (a) An organised medical service and permanent medical supervision of the health conditions of crews and' of the population of the port. (b) An equipment for the transport of the sick and suitable accommodation for their isolation and for keeping suspected persons under observation. (c) Installations necessary for efficient disinfection and disinsectisation: a bacteriological laboratory and arrangements to permit immediate vaccination against Small.pox and other diseases. 27 (d) A supply of drinking water of quality above suspicion at the disposal ol the port, and a system as effective as possible for the removal of excrement, refuse and sewage. (e) A competent and adequate staff and necessary equipment for the deratisation of ships, shipyards, docks and warehouses. (f) A permanent organisation for the trapping and examination of rodents. It is also recommended that warehouses and docks should, as far as possible, be rat.proof. (15) Each country undertakes to have a single sanitary tariff only, which shall be published, the charges of which shall be moderate and shall be applied to all ships without, flag distinction. Note.—The Convention regulates in detail the sanitary measures which may be applied in relation to the more dangerous infectious diseases, and is of much wider scope than is indicated by the above extracts, which are brought to the notice of the Committee because they are new provisions or are of special interest. You have already sanctioned the appointment of three rat.searchers to inspect ships as to their degree of rat infestation, under Article 28. It may be necessary at a later date to increase this number in order to be able to cope with the additional work without delay or inconvenience to the trade of the Port. Expenditure on this service should be covered by the fees chargeable for certificates of Deratisation or Exemption from Deratisation. You will note the increased attention given in the Convention to measures of rat.destruction, rat.proofing and the bacteriological examination of rats for Plague. The Port of London Sanitary Authority have for many years realised that Plague prevention is a matter of rat.extermination, and have acted accordingly, but it may be necessary to make certain adjustments in regard to administrative details which were, I believe, foreshadowed by your former Medical Officer. In general, it may be said that the practice of the Port of London Sanitary Authority is, and has for some years been, in accordance with the principles set forth in the new International Sanitary Convention.

On 20th November a Public Enquiry was held in connection with an application by the Gravesend Corporation for a loan for the extension of their sewerage scheme. Since there is frequent complaint from the staff at Denton Hospital of the nauseating smell from the Gravesend Sewage Works, your Medical Officer attended the Enquiry, and ascertained that it was merely concerned with the bringing of another small district of Gravesend into the existing scheme. It was stated, however, that before long another Enquiry would be held in connection with an application by the Gravesend Corporation for a loan for the extension and improvement of the sewage disposal works, and that that would be th'e time for the Port Sanitary Authority to state their case. Nevertheless, your Medical Officer pointed out that serious nuisance was already complained of in connection with the existing sewage disposal works and that the Port Sanitary Authority viewed with serious concern the proposal to increase the volume of sewage arriving at the works for treatment, as it appeared to them that an increase of the nuisance would inevitably result therefrom.
