During this period 99 Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are particulars:— 9 Board Meetings— Ordinary 19 Special 2 Total — 21 Committee Meetings— Finance 22 Law and Parliamentary 7 Sanitary 12 Works 21 Special 16 Total — 78 Making in all a total of 99 Changes in the Personnel of the Board. At the election of members in June, 1899, Messrs. Charles Bussell and J. Iverson Yates were elected in the place of Mr. S. J. Coulson and Lieut. Col. E. J. Gardiner, who retired by effluxion of time and Mr. Charles Dibdin was elected in the place of Mr. Richard Harnell who had left the District. Subsequently a vacancy occurred owing to the resignation of Mr. Frederick German, and this was filled by the re-election of Lieut. Col. Gardiner. During the year a vacancy also occurred by the resignation of Mr. Joshua Halliday Gudgeon which was filled by the appointment of Mr. Harry William Christmas. Since that date the Board, with regret, received the intimation of the death of Mr. Gudgeon. At the first meeting in June, 1899, Robert "William Dibdin, Esq., was elected Chairman of the Board. 10 Accounts. The accounts for tlie past year have been prepared in the usual form, and after being examined by the Board's Chartered Accountant, have been investigated by the elected Auditors, whose certificate of the result of their examination will be found appended at the foot of the accounts on page 57.

Gr. Warren, A.C.A.,. 12 who had long been associated with him in the work, and who had succeeded to Mr. Scrivener's practice, was appointed to fill the vacancy. St. Giles Public Library. The proceedings of the Commissioners, who are elected under the Public Libraries Act, 1892, are published separately. Death of the Right Hon. Sir CHARLES HALL, K.C.M.G., Q.C., M.P. During the year the district, and indeed, the whole constituency of Holborn, sustained a very severe loss in the death, after a short illness, of its representative in the House of Commons—the Right Hon. Sir Charles Hall, K.C.M.Gr., Q.C., M.P. On the sad intelligence being reported to them the Board unanimously adopted the following resolution, which was communicated to the relatives, and by them very courteously acknowledged:— "That this Board desire to place on record the great loss which the district has sustained in the death, at a comparatively early age, of the Right Hon. Sir Charles Hall, K.C.M.G., Q.C., M.P. They fully recognise the great services rendered by the distinguished member to the district which he so ably represented in Parliament, and desire to offer their sympathy with his relatives in their heavy loss." Visit of Her Majesty the Queen to London on the 8th March, 1900. On the occasion of the visit of Her Majesty the Queen to London early in the spring it was ascertained that on Thursday, the 8th March, Her Majesty would probably 13 drive through parts of the St. Giles District. As soon as definite information was obtained, the ratepayers and occupiers of property on the whole line from Holborn Circus to Tottenham Court Road were invited to decorate their places of business. This suggestion was promptly taken up, and the whole line of thoroughfare was most beautifully decorated. The reception accorded to Her Majesty can best be described in Her Majesty's own words, the following letter having been received by the Clerk to the Board from Lieut.-Colonel Sir Arthur Bigge, K.C.B., C.M.C., a few days after the Queen's drive:— " Windsor Castle, "March 10th, 1900. "Sir,—In reply to your letter of yesterday, the Queen was much gratified and touched by the loyal and hearty reception accorded to Her Majesty in passing through some part of the St. Giles District, and indeed, throughout all parts of the Metropolis visited by Her Majesty. "The Queen was very sorry that a mistake occurred in announcing the day of her drive. "Her Majesty thought that your street decorations were very effective. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient servant, "ARTHUR BIGGE. " Henry C. Jones, Esq., " Clerk to the Board of Works for the St Giles District." Improvements. Boziers Court. The various claims in connection with the property required for the purpose of Boziers Court Improvement having been adjusted, the work of demolition of the property was carried out, and at the time of preparing this Report the necessary works in connection with the- 14 widening of the carriageway and footway are well in hand. The resnlt of the improvement is already seen to be very great, and the relief which will be given to the congested traffic must prove of great advantage. City Lands in Tottenham Court Road. During the year the Corporation of London, who are the owners of a large block of property in Tottenham Court Road, Store Street, and adjoining thoroughfares, submitted a proposal to wliich they desired the Board's consent; it involved the abolition of North and South Crescents, the rebuilding of houses in Store Street, Alfred Place, and Chenies Street, and the construction of a new Street from Chenies Street into Alfred Mews, with a widening of the Mews into Tottenham Court Road, and the construction of a new Street from the rear of the property in South Crescent into Tottenham Court Road. Believing that the same would be a great improvement the Board intimated to the Corporation of London that, subject to the adjustment of all details and to the sanction of the London County Council being obtained, they would be prepared to give their cordial support to the proposals. The works have been sanctioned by the London County Council, and it is anticipated that as soon as the leases of the property have expired the new thoroughfares will be constructed. New Street from High Holborn to the Strand. When the last Annual Report was prepared the Bill promoted by the London County Council for the formation of the new Street from High Holborn to the Strand and 15 the widening of Southampton Row had been referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons. After a protracted examination the Bill passed, and the acquisition of the property has already commenced; it is, however, much to be regretted that the works connected with the widening of Southampton Row have not yet been commenced, the loss of rates is a serious matter. In connection with the widening of Southampton Row, the Board have suggested to the Council that the North side of High Holborn should be widened as far as No. 107, so as to increase the width of the thoroughfare at that point to 70 feet. The subject is under consideration at the present time. London Covernment Act, 1899. The most important subject that has engaged the attention of the Board during the past year have been the numerous questions which have arisen in consequence of the passing of the London Government Act, 1899. In the last Report it was stated that the Government had determined that the area of the Parliamentary Borough of Holborn was to be one of the new Metropolitan Boroughs included in the Schedule to the Bill, and although endeavours were made to induce the House of Commons to dissent to this view, they were unsuccessful, and when the Bill passed into law it was found that the promise made by the First Lord of the Treasury had been carried out. Almost immediately after the passing of the Act Commissioners were appointed; they were Sir Hugh Owen, K.C.B., late Secretary of the Local Government Board, who was appointed Chairman, A. T. Lawrence, Esq., Q.C., and Sir Samuel Johnson, Town Clerk of Nottingham. 16 The Commissioners immediately entered upon their duties under the Act and called for information upon a variety of matters which it was necessary for them to take into consideration. One of the first of these was what adjustments of boundaries of the areas mentioned in the Schedule to the Act were expedient for simplification or convenience of administration. The St. Giles District is surrounded on the west and north by St. Pancras; on the east by the Holborn District, and on the south by the Liberty of the Rolls and St. Clement Danes, and on the west by St. Martin-in-the-Fields. *On the 8th August, 1899, the principal Officers of the Board presented a Report showing those portions of the District in which there were houses or property which were partly within and partly without the District, together with suggestions for adjustment on all sides. This Report was unanimously adopted by the Board and (with the maps therein referred to) transmitted to the Commissioners. Communications passed between the Clerk to the Board and the Commissioners, and interviews with Sir Hugh Owen took place, in the course of which modifications of these suggestions were put forward; negotiations were opened up with the authorities of the adjoining Parishes with a view, if possible, of giving effect to the recommendations of the Commissioners that joint representations as to adjustments of boundaries should, wherever practicable, take place. After much negotiation, this was only found practicable in one case, viz., with the Vestry of St. Pancras, where an agreed adjustment was arrived at, the boundary of the Parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields being extended northwards along the middle of Tottenham Court Road to the middle of Francis 17 Street, and down the middle of tliat thoroughfare, across Gower Street and Torrington Place to where it joined the boundary of the Parish of St. George, Bloomsbnry; thence it was taken southward to the middle of Marchmont Street, down the middle of that thoroughfare to the middle of Great Coram Street, thence eastwards to the middle of Kenton Street, thence southwards down the middle of Kenton Street to the middle of Bernard Street, thence along the middle of Bernard Street to that part of Herbrand Street, formerly Colonnade Mews, which lies in the rear of the Hotel Russell; along the middle of Herbrand Street, across Guilford Street to the boundary of the Parish in Bolton Mews. This decision involved the transfer of a considerable quantity of rateable property from the St. Giles District to St. Pancras. It was agreed that there should be transferred from the Borough of St. Pancras to the Borough of Holborn all that part of the Parish lying to the south of the middle of Guilford Street as far as Henry Street, thence along the middle of Henry Street to the middle of Doughty Mews. At an Inquiry held by J. W. Thompson, Esq., an Assistant Commissioner, at the St. Pancras Vestry Hall, on the 30th November, an agreed representation to this effect was supported by the Board and the Yestry of St. Pancras, and was accepted by the Commissioner. In the other cases the question of adjustment was not so satisfactorily dealt with. At an Inquiry held before T. R. Colquhoun Dill, Esq., at the Westminster Town Hall, on the 30th November, the question of the adjustment of boundaries of the various Parishes with the Borough of Westminster was discussed. After several days' inquiry the boundaries between the B 18 St. Giles District and the Borough of Westminster were dealt with in part. Where the boundary with St. Martinin-the-Fields was concerned, an agreement was arrived at by which the boundary of the Parish of St. Giles-in-theFields, where it joined that of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in Drury Lane, was advanced a few feet further south, and taken along the middle of Drury Lane to the middle of Brokers Alley, and along the middle of Brokers Alley to where it joined the existing boundary in Castle Street; and it was agreed, as part of the bargain, that the future cost of cleansing, lighting, and maintaining the whole of Brokers Alley, and the whole of the carriage-way of so much of Castle Street as lies to the east of Langley Street should be undertaken by the St. Giles District, and the residue of the carriage-way of Castle Street by the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The adjustment of boundaries with St. Clement Danes and the Liberty of the Rolls involved questions of more serious importance, which were somewhat complicated by the desire of the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn that the whole of what is popularly known as Lincoln's Inn—that is, the Ville, with New Square, Old Square, Old Buildings—should be in one and the same Borough. The Board of Works for the Strand District while not objecting to this, claimed, in order that some compensation for the loss of rateable value should take place, that the whole of the houses on the south side of Lincoln's Inn Fields with certain houses in Kemble Street and the block of buildings bounded by Drury Lane on the west, Kemble Street on the south, Great Wild Street on the east, and Great Queen Street on the north, should be transferred to the Borough of Westminster. The question was thoroughly examined, and after a l9 protracted Inquiry the Commissioner came to the conclusion that the wishes of the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn must be had regard to, and consequently the contention of the Board of "Works for the Strand District must prevail. The result of this was the loss of property of considerable rateable value to the St. Giles District. Another Inquiry in which the Board took part in which questions of adjustment of boundaries were concerned was one held at the Clerkenwell Town Hall by T. R. Colquhoun Dill, Esq., on the question of adjustment of boundaries between the Eastern portion of the Parliamentary Division of Holborn and the adjoining Districts. This was not a matter which affected the St. Giles District to such an extent as the points discussed at the prior Inquiries, but it was felt desirable that the ratepayers of the St. Giles District should be represented, having regard to the fact that their interest was predominant in the new Borough. Ultimately a line which was to a certain extent a compromise between all the Authorities, was adopted by the Commissioners. The Inquiry as to the boundaries of Holborn disclosed no difficulties, because the boundaries having been adjusted between the parishes surrounding it, naturally the adoption of the boundary line of the new Borough must be the lines then settled, but an important point arose as to the name which was to be given to the new Borough. On the part of the Board of Works for the St. Giles District it was suggested that "Bloomsbury" was the name which would commend itself to all parties concerned; on the other hand the Board of Works for the Holborn District contended that as Parliament had already recognised the B 2 20 name of Holborn by applying it, not only to the Parliamentary Borough but also to the County Council Electoral Division and in other ways, that it was more appropriate for the purpose. Into the details of the evidence given at the Inquiry it is not necessary to enter here; suffice it to say that the Commissioners came to the conclusion that the name of the Borough should be Holborn. The question of boundaries having been decided, the next question, which involved consideration, was the constitution of Wards and the allocation of Councillors for the Borough of Holborn, and on this subject the Commissioners themselves prepared a scheme by which they proposed to allot to the St. Giles group of Parishes, including Lincoln's Inn, 24 Councillors, and to the Holborn group of Parishes, including Cray's Inn, Staple Inn, and Furnivals Inn, 18 Councillors. The Board of Works for the Holborn District did not approve of this proposal, nor of the inclusion of Lincoln's Inn as part of a Ward of St. Giles, but they suggested that Lincoln's Inn with Gray's Inn, Furnivals Inn, and Staple Inn, should be formed into a Ward by themselves, or that Lincoln's Inn should become part of a Ward of St. Andrew's, to which Parish it was at the time attached for the purpose of Parliamentary Elections, and that the number of Councillors to be allotted to St. Giles Parishes should be decreased with a corresponding increase of representatives to the Holborn Parishes. After consideration of the proposals of the Board of Works for the Holborn District it was the opinion of the Board of Works for the St. Giles District that no argument had been put forward sufficiently to justify the Commissioners in departing from their conclusion. In order to 21 afford an opportunity for all parties baiag heard, the Commissioners decided that a Local Inquiry should take place on the matter. At this, not only the Board of Works for the St. Giles District but also the Board of Works for the Holborn District, the Vestry of the Liberty of Saffron Hill, and the Governors and Directors of the Poor of the United Parishes of St. Andrew, Holborn-above-the-Bars, and St. George the Martyr, Middlesex, were represented, as well as the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn. The whole of the details of the rateable value, population, and all the circumstances were gone into, and after some little delay the Commissioners published a draft scheme, which, excepting for minor matters of detail, followed their original proposals, and they decided that the Councillors for the Borough of Holborn should be 42, and that the Borough should be divided into nine Wards, which were to have a representation as follows:— Saffron Hill Ward.—Three Councillors. This Ward will consist of the Liberty of Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Ely Rents, and Ely Place. This is coloured purple on the map which accompanies this Report. North St. Andrew Ward.—Three Councillors. To consist of that part of the Parish of St. Andrew, Holbornabove-the-Bars, lying to the west of Gray's Inn Road, coloured grey on the map. South-East St. Andrew Ward.—Nine Councillors. To consist of the residue of the Parish of St. Andrew, Holborn-above-the-Bars, with Furnivals Inn, Staple Inn, and Gray's Inn, coloured orange on the map. St. George-the-Martyr Ward.—Three Councillors. To consist of the Parish of St. George-the-Martyr, coloured light green on the map. 22 North St. Giles Ward.—Three Councillors. To consist of that part of the Parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields lying north of New Oxford Street, coloured dark green on the map. Central St. Giles Ward.—Six Councillors. To consist of that part of the Parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields lying south of New Oxford Street and West of Drury Lane, coloured yellow on the map. Lincoln's Inn Ward.—Six Councillors. To consist of the residue of the Parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and Lincoln's Inn, coloured blue on the map. North Bloomsbury Ward. — Three Councillors. To consist of that part of the Parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, lying to the North of Bernard Street, Russell Square, and Keppel Street, coloured brown on the map. South Bloomsbury Ward.— Six Councillors. To consist of the residue of the Parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, coloured pink on the map. Further representations, it is understood, have been made by the Board of Works for the Holborn District to the Privy Council on the subject of the Scheme, but at the time of preparing this Report it has been issued in the form indicated. There are a considerable number of details which will have to be considered before the Act can be brought into operation. A number of Schemes have been prepared by the Commissioners — and considered by the Board —for dealing with various questions, but there yet remains one of the most important of all subjects, viz., Financial adjustments as between Parishes and Boroughs. There 23 are also many other matters of detail, too complicated to be included in the limits of this Report, which are also receiving attention, and will have to be dealt with by the Commissioners before the Act can be brought into operation. Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899. This Act empowers local authorities to make advances to residents within their District for the purpose of enabling them to acquire the ownership of the house. No application has yet been made to the Board to put the Act in force. Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (Bye-laws) Act, 1899. This Bill was referred to in the last Annual Report, and it was there stated that the Board had expressed approval of the same. With slight modifications it passed into law, but no bye-laws on the subject have yet been made by the London County Council. Census 1901, Great Britain, Act. Prior to the introduction of this Measure the Board passed a resolution as to the taking of the census of 1901, and directed that a communication be addressed to the President of the Local Government Board suggesting that the time had arrived when, at all events in the County of London, a quinquennial census should take place instead of a decennial census, and that the census should not be taken on the night of either Saturday or Sunday of any week, but should be taken in the middle of the week, as by this means the population of the 24 various Districts of London could be more accurately ascertained, and that in ascertaining the number of inhabited houses every self-contained tenement should be enumerated as a separated house. The President of the Local Government Board, on being communicated with, expressed his inability to assent to the suggestions made, and the Bill passed into law on very much the same lines as the Census Act of 1890. Parliamentary Bills and Schemes. Various projects and schemes have been examined by the Law and Parliamentary Committee during the year, among them being the following: Land Registry and other Offices Bill. London Sea Water Supply Bill. Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation Bill. London Hydraulic Power Company's Bill. London County Council Acquisition of Spitalfields Market Bill. London County Council General Powers Bill. London County Council Compulsory Purchase of Land Bill. London County Council Tramways Nos. 1 and 2 Bills. London County Council Rotherhithe and Ratcliff Tunnel Bill. London County Council Water Bills. London County Council, Gas Light and Coke, Commercial Gas, and South Metropolitan Gas Companies' Bill. Central London Railway Company's Bill. Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Bill. County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company's Bill. School Board Elections (London) Bill. 25 Land Registry and other Offices Bill. This was a Bill, introduced as a Government measure, for the purpose of enabling property on the South side of Lincoln's Inn Fields, the West side of Serle Street, and the North side of Portugal Street, to be acquired for the purpose of extending the Land Registry Offices. By the scheme which has been prepared by the Commissioners under the London Government Act, 1899,for the adjustment of Boundaries, this portion of the Parish of St. Giles-inthe-Fields has become part of the City of Westminster, and under these circumstances the Board did not think it necessary to take any action on the Bill. London Sea Water Supply Bill. This Bill proposes to confer further powers upon the London Sea Water Supply Company, and to extend the time for the exercise of their compulsory powers, but as it . did not propose to prejudicially affect the interests of the St. Giles District the Board did not take any action in the matter. Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation Bill. This Bill proposed to confer powers on the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation to construct a generating station in the Parish of West Ham, to lay mains connecting their generating stations, to acquire lands and to construct a short line of railway, and for other purposes, but as the Bill did not in any way propose to affect the interests of the St. Giles District the Board did not take any action on the same. 26 London Hydraulic Power Company's Bill. This Bill proposed to amend the London HydraulicPower Company's Acts, 1871 and 1884, so far as the provisions of Section 5 of the Act of 1884 were concerned, by conferring powers on the Board of Trade on the application of either the Company or a local authority to determine the conditions upon which an extension of the Company's mains should be made. From a statement made by the Secretary to the Company it appeared that the necessity for further powers had arisen in consequence of the refusal of certain local authorities either absolutely or by the imposition of impracticable conditions to permit mains to be laid or hydraulic power to be supplied in the areas under their control, and it was suggested by these authorities that the Board should oppose the Bill, but having regard to the manner in which the Company had always carried out the agreements entered into by the Board with them, they resolved to offer no opposition to the Bill, but to suggest to the promoters the desirability of the time for considering applications being extended from 21 days to 42 days. The Bill was, however, opposed by other local authorities, and on being referred to a Select Committee was rejected. London County Council Acquisition of Spitalfields Market Bill. This Bill proposed to confer powers on the London County Council and the freeholders of Spitalfields Market for the acquisition by the Council of the market rights and property, but as the measure did not in any way affect the interests of the St. Giles District the Board did not take any action in the matter. 27 London County Council Ceneral Powers Bill. This Bill proposed inter alia to confer powers on the London County Council to acquire property for the purpose of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act, 1865, and for the rehousing of persons displaced by the London (Clare Market, Strand) Improvement Confirmation Act, 1897, and the London County Council Improvements (Holborn to Strand) Act, 1899; also to enable the Council and local authorities in various parts of the County of London to make arrangements as to open spaces, and for other purposes. The proposal for rehousing persons displaced by the Clare Market and new Street schemes was of great importance. The site proposed to be acquired was the properly known as Reid's Brewery, in Clerkenwell Road. As the Bill did not propose in any way to affect the interests of the St. Giles District the Board did not take any action in the matter. London County Council Compulsory Purchase of Land Bill. This Bill proposed to confer on the London County Council the powers at present enjoyed by local authorities in the County of London under Sections 80 to 96 of Michael Angelo Taylor's Act (57 Geo. iii. chap. 29), with regard to the purchase of property for the purposes of minor street improvements, but as the Bill did not in any way propose to take away, modify, or affect any of the powers at present exercised by local authorities, the Board did not deem it necessary to take any action in the matter. The Bill was not, however, proceeded with. 28 London County Council Tramways Nos. 1 and 2 Bills. The first of these Bills proposed to confer powers on the London County Council to construct new tramways, to reconstruct or alter existing tramways, and to work tramways by electrical traction; and the second Bill proposed to confer powers on the Council to work their existing tramways by electrical power and for other purposes. Neither of the Bills proposed in any way to affect the interests of the St. Giles District, and under the circumstances the Board did not deem it necessary to take any action in the matter. London County Council Rotherhithe and Ratcliff Tunnel Bill. This Bill proposed to empower the London County Council to construct a tunnel or subway under the Thames between Rotherhithe and Ratcliff with approaches thereto and for other purposes connected therewith at an estimated expense of £2,198,250. As in the case of the preceding Bills, it did not. affect the interests of the St. Giles District and consequently no action was taken in the matter. London County Council Water Bills. Only two Bills on the subject of Water Supply have been introduced by the London County Council this Session, the first having reference to the Welsh Supply and the second to the Purchase of Companies. They were similar in terms to those introduced in the Session of 1899, with reference to which the Board were of opinion that legislation on the subject was premature at that time, but having regard to the magnitude of the question, the Board were not prepared to enter upon a long and expensive Parliamentary opposition to the Bills now under discussion, and consequently no action was taken. 29 London County Council, Gas Light and Coke, Commercial Gas, and South Metropolitan Cas Companies Bill. This was a Bill to make further provisions as to testing the illuminating power of Gas supplied by the Companies, and for regulating the supply by them of prepayment meters and fittings; no action, however, was taken by the Board in the matter. The proposal contained in the Bill for testing the illuminating power of Gas by means of portable photometers was struck out of the Bill by the Committee to whom the same was referred. Central London Railway Company's Bill. This Bill proposed to amend the Central London Railway Act of 1891 with reference to Cheap Fares for the Labouring Classes, and to impose upon the Company an obligation to run sitfficient trains and to issue tickets for the convenience of workmen over their system. No action was taken in the matter. Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Bill. This Bill proposed to amend the Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1894 to 1899, and to extend the time for the exercise of compulsory powers. The measure did not propose to prejudicially affect the St. Giles District, and no action was taken by the Board in the matter. County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company's Bill. This Bill, promoted by the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, proposed to 30 confer powers upon them to supply Electrical energy from generating stations outside the District. The Bill was opposed by certain other Local Authorities in whose districts cables were proposed to be laid. At the time of preparing this Report the Bill was under consideration by a Select Committee. School Board Elections (London) Bill. This Bill was promoted by the School Board for London for the purpose of assimilating the electoral divisions of the Board with those of the London County Council and for Parliamentary purposes, and thereby to abolish the cumulative vote. The Board being of opinion that the time had arrived when the electoral divisions of the School Board should be assimilated with those for Parliamentary and other purposes, presented a petition to the House of Commons in favour of the Bill. Removal of House Refuse (Bi-weekly Collection from all Houses in the District). During the very hot weather in the summer of 1899 the question of the removal of house refuse came prominently before the public, and the Board resolved, at all events, as an experiment, that during the summer the same should be removed twice a week. After some months' trial it was decided that the change should be permanent, but the result has not been so successful as the Board hoped, partly owing to the difficulty of dealing with the Contractors' employees, and partly owing to the disinclination that there is on the part of certain householders (or, perhaps, more strictly speaking, their 31 domestics) who object to a bi-weekly collection. The present arrangement will be continued in force until the 25th March next, after which it will be a matter for further consideration. Repairs over openings made by Gas, Water, Electric Lighting, and other Companies. The question of the repairs over openings made by Gas, Water, Electric Lighting, and other Companies has been under consideration, and it has been determined that in future the Companies should be called upon to do the work themselves. Public Lavatories (Assessment to Income Tax). The question of the assessment of Public Lavatories to Income Tax under Schedule A was mentioned in the last Annual Report. After some negotiations the Commissioners of Inland Revenue intimated that they did not intend to persevere in the assessment under Schedule A if the Board were willing that the profits should be subject to assessment under Schedule D. On the condition that the takings of all the Lavatories were pooled, and that the cost of maintaining the Street Urinals was taken into consideration, the Board intimated that they would have no objection to this suggestion, and accordingly an assessment on what is believed to be a reasonable amount has been assented to. Renaming of Streets. During the year an order was made by the London County Council for renaming Great Coram Street "Coram Street." 32 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Mr. James Kear Colwell, F.I.C., was, on the 1st May,. 1899, again appointed Public Analyst. His Report will be found on page 77, and from it full details of the samples analysed can be obtained. During the year 444 samples were purchased and analysed. Of these, 54 were adulterated, but in 33 cases the adulteration was not so serious as to necessitate any proceedings; in the other cases prosecutions ensued, and fines and costs, amounting in the whole to £70 13s., were inflicted. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, which received the Royal Assent on the 9th August last, came into force on the 1st January, 1900. During the period which has elapsed since then there has not been much opportunity of judging the effect of the new legislation, but so far as prosecutions have ensued they have disclosed the fact that the difficulties which have hampered the operations of Local Authorities in the past have not been removed by present legislation. Sanitary Work. The monthly synopsis of Sanitary Work which is forwarded to every member affords a useful record of the steps taken for preserving the public health in the District. Calculated on the information published month by month the following statistics are obtained :— Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Visits and Inspections made 11,624 Notices for Abatement of Nuisances served 935 Proceedings before Police Magistrates 23 33 Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, the premises, No. 44, Sardinia Street, and a room over the stable in the rear of No. 22, Little Wild Street, have been closed as unfit for human habitation, and the premises No. 66, Castle Street, which were closed in the year 1897, having been made fit for human habitation, have been reopened. In two instances it was found necessary to take proceedings before police magistrates for the abatement of smoke nuisances. Lodging House Regulations. Number of houses on the Register 617 Notices to abate breaches served 287 Proceedings taken 11 Closing of Public Ways. During the year orders were, with the consent of the Board, made by the Justices for the closing of Lascelles Place and Lascelles Court, Broad Street. Drinking Fountains and Cattle Troughs. During the year the Board resumed the custody and maintenance of the drinking fountains in the District. Employees' Holiday. The usual outing of the Board's Employees took place on the 24th June, 1899. The Board made a grant of £10, in addition to the men's wages, and were gratified to receive in due course from the Engineer a report stating that the outing had been much appreciated, and the whole arrangements had passed off satisfactorily.

The macadamized roadways in the District were recoated and repaired with broken granite, a steam roller being used where necessary to level the surface. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. The Contracts for free maintenance of the following streets having expired during the year, further contracts were entered into by your Board, and the several Contractors who laid the pavements, for a continuance of such maintenance for the periods and at the prices named. Period of farther Price to be paid per yard maintenance. supl. per annum. High Street 10 years 1 0 Church Passage 15 „ 0 4 The existing Contracts for the maintenance of the asphalte pavements in Hart Street, Bloomsbury Square (South Side), Vernon Place, Gower Street, Southampton Row, Torrington Square, and Bedford Place, will expire 60 luring the ensuing year, and your Board in February last,, took the question of the future maintenance of the pavements into consideration, but inasmuch as by the London Grovernment Act your Board will cease to exist on the 1st of Novembpr, and its duties will be taken over by the new Borough Council, the Board did not think it expedient to enter into lengthy Contracts in respect of the pavements, but as the pavings were getting into bad repair, arrangements were entered into with the Companies who laid them to continue the maintenance until the 25th March, 1901, which would take them well into the period when the District would be under control of the new Authority. The following are the terms agreed to, compared with those under the old Contracts :— Name of Street. Present agreed price. Former price. Hart Street ls. 6d. 6d. BloomRbury Square, South side ls. 6d. 6d. Vernon Place ls. 6d. 6d. Uower Street ls. Od 4d. Southampton Row ls. 8d. 6d. In the case of Torrington Square, the offer of the Valde-Travers Asphalte Paving *Company to maintain the paving for a further term of 12 years at the existing price of maintenance, 3d. a yard, was accepted by the Board, the Asphalte in this street being in better condition than in the other streets. The question of the maintenance of Bedford Place was adjourned until after the new sewer, which the Board then had it in contemplation to build, was completed. The sewer work is now in hand, and when it is finished the question of the maintenance of the paving will again be brought forward. 61 Bedford Square. The Board having resolved to repave the carriage way on the north side of Bedford Square with asphalte, thought the disturbance of the old paving presented a favourable opportunity for widening the footway round the garden, next the centre of the Square, to 10 feet, the old footway being onty 6 feet wide, in a similar manner to what had been done in Russell Square some years ago. The work was completed on the 29th June, 1899. House Drains. 144 applications were received during the year for the construction of new, and reconstruction of existing drains, at various premises within the District. The whole of the drains laid were tested by the Board's officers before being covered in ; the fees received in respect of same amounted to £31 7s. 6d. Sewers. The following new Sewers and works in connection with •Sewers were constructed during the year :— Woburn Place, (Dorth of Coram" Street) 410ft. run 4ft. by 2ft. 6in., new brick sewer constructed. Woburn Place (south of Coram" Street) 298ft. run existing sewer underpinned and repaired. Upper Montague Street 395ft. run ditto part new sewer. Silver Street (Southampton Street" to Barter Street) 244ft. run 4ft. by 2ft. 6in., new brick sewer constructed. Monarch Yard 80ft. run 9in. pipe sewer. Arthur Street " New manholes built to existing sewers. Broad Street Gate Street Streatham Street Arthur Street New side entrances built to existing sewers. Hyde Street Little Earl Street 62 Cleansing Sewers. Certain of the sewers in the District which have dead ends, or in which the flow of sewage is not sufficient to enable the sewer to be self-cleansing1, are fitted with flushing tanks. They are as follows :— Situation Capacity of Tank Flushing apparatus in use Chapel Yard 450 gallons. Automatic selfacting syphon. Clarkes Buildings 600 do. do. do. Clarices Mews 400 do.

The water used at the above tanks amounted to 1,419,000 gallons. 63 The following sewers were flushed by water obtained from the New River Company's mains, through leather hose, during the summer months; the quantity of water used was 4,175,800 gallons :— Alfred Mews. Bainbridge Street. Bedford Avenue. Bernard Mews. Calsen Yard. Charlotte Mews. Church Passage. Compton Mews. Dunn's Passage. Galen Place (N. end). Gate Street. George Yard. Goldsmith Street.

Queen Street, Red Car Yard. Ridgmount Garden. Ridgmount Street. Serle Street. Stone Yard. Titchborne Court. Woburn Mews. Gullies. The street gully pits, for intercepting solid matter which would otherwise enter the sewers, were emptied by hand labour, and their contents loaded into vans and taken away. The quantity thus removed amounted to 1,775 van loads; there were also 58 van loads of solid matter removed from the sewers, the total amounting to over 5,000 cubic yards. The pits after being emptied, were recharged with a solution of perchloride of mercury, for disinfecting purposes. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the District was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, numbering 50, and comprising 1 foreman, 5 gangers, and 44 sweepers. In addition to the manual labour employed, 2 sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the carriageways. 64 The street sweepings were loaded into vans and taken away, the total quantity during the year amounting to a total of 6,453 van-loads, equal to over 19,000 cubic yards. The surfaces of the following public ways were flushed with water taken from the New River Company's mains through leather hose, the quantity of water used amounting to 8,438,540 gallons :— Bain bridge Street. Bernard Mews. Bloomsbury Court. Bucknall Street. Carrier Street. Castle Street. Clarkes Buildings. Denmark Place. Drury Lane'. Dunns Passage. Eagle Street. Galen Place. Gate Street. George Yard.

Wild Court. The carriage-ways of all main thoroughfares where paved with wood and asphalte were washed in the early morning during the year by means of water distributed by watering vans. The cost of this washing is included in the two items of street cleansing and street watering, given hereafter. 65 Cost op Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year, including the Sunday work, was as follows :— Wages of men £3,805 2 5 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, etc., and clothing for men 508 0 4 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, removal of manure, etc., and hire of horses for streetsweeping machines 3,525 0 0 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, etc. 795 13 0 Water for flushing surfaces of courts, etc. 2R0 4 0 £8,893 19 9 Street Watering. The watering of the public ways was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all vans, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the District not available for vehicular traffic, or which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used, including that used for washing the surfaces of the asphalte and wood-paved roads, amounted to 6,268,000 gallons. During the summer months, permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering carts, one ounce being used to 400 gallons of water. The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the market streets between 12 noon and 2.30 p.m., when the condition of the weather ren dered it desirable. In the latter watering, disinfectants e G6 were added to the water in the vans, during the whole of the year. The cost of the work was as follows:— To Contractor for horses, carts, and drivers £1,000 0 0 The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, etc., was 229 7 7 For disinfectants 75 17 6 £1,305 5 1 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,850. The refuse removed amounted to 8,457 van loads, equal to over 25,000 cubic yards. Your Board in 27th July, 1899, having received various complaints from time to time of offensive smells proceeding from the accumulation of animal and vegetable refuse in the houses of the inhabitants during the hot weather, for so long a period as a week, resolved to have it removed twice a week, instead of once a week as had been the custom heretofore. Arrangements were accordingly made with your Contractor to that effect, and the work was commenced on the 31st July, the Board agreeing to pay the Contractor £40 a month additional to his contract sum for the extra labour and cartage caused by this bi-weekly collection. Great difficulty was experienced in carrying this out, and many complaints were received from the inhabitants ; the Contractor apparently did his best, but he alleged that he had the greatest difficulty in getting workmen to perform the work in the way required, they alleging that it took 67 them twice as long to get a load, and being paid piece-work, they consequently did not earn so much money—he accordingly raised the payments to them, to enable them to earn the same amount as before, but in spite of this the men still objected to the bi-weekly removal, and he had exceeding difficulty in getting men to do it. The Contractor, moreover, alleged that many householders themselves objected to having the dust removed twice a week, stating that it gave them more trouble, made a mess in their house, and there were other reasons., The Board thereupon, in the month of February, resolved to discontinue the bi-weekly collection for two months to give Mr. Cookson, the Contractor, an opportunity of organising his staff, and to make arrangements for better carrying on the work in the future. This period expired on the 1st May, and the bi-weekly collection has been renewed, but the time it has been at work is too short to form any opinion as to its success. The disinfection of the dust bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the Contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £9 6s. The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, etc., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year at a cost of £20 17s. 3d. :— Limewhiting Courts, Calsen Yard. Compton Mews. Denmark Place. Dunns Passage. Halls Yard. Kennedy Court. Lascelles Court. Middle Yard. Woburn Mews. Neals Yard. New Yard. Nottingham Court. Plummers Court. Portsmouth Place. Sardinia Place. Sardinia Street. Silver Street. Southampton Mews. e 2 68 Underground Lavatories. The number of underground lavatories belonging to the Board remain as last year, three in number. They continue to be very largely used, and every day shows more and more the convenience afforded to the public by their provision. In July, 1898, your Engineer had a tally taken of the persons using them, and the figures were given in his Report of last year. They were as follows :— Men's Lavatories. Total number using convenience in one week. Number using water closets. Number using urinals. Average per day of total. Shaftesbury Avenue 10,804 1,399 9,405 1,543 New Oxford Street 31,539 3,441 28,098 4,505 High Holborn 14,317 1,620 12,697 2,045 Women's Lavatories. Total number using convenience in one week. Number using water closets. Number using lavatory basins. Average per day of Total. Shaftesbury Avenue 476 465 11 66 New Oxford Street 2,498 2,328 170 357 High Holborn 618 576 42 88 No examination has been made since then, but from the takings it is proved that in the case of the men's lavatories 8,824 more persons used the w.c.'s and lavatory basins in 1899 than in the previous year, and 5,245 more persons used the women's w.c.'s and lavatory. The figures do not include the number of men using the urinals only. The quantity of water used during the year was 5,761,000 gallons. 69 Above-ground Urinals. The following is a list of the public urinals belonging to and maintained by the Board above ground in the St. Giles District:— Number of Compartments. Number of Compartments. Colonnade 6 Seven Dials 6 Dunns Passage 5 Shorts Gardens 6 Galen Place 3 Torrington Mews l Little Guilford Street 4 Whetstone Park 3 The quantity of water used at the above-ground urinals within the District during the year was 1,906,000 gallons. Public Lighting. The following are the number of public lamps within the District. 793 Lamps, circular, consuming 5 cubic feet of gas per hour 97 „ square, „ 5 „ „ „ „ 148 „ do. „ 6 „ „ „ „ 9 „ square and circular 8 feet 21 „ „ „ „ 10 feet 9 „ „ „ „ 12 feet 18 „ square 15 feet 9 „ hexagon and square 20 feet 1 „ hexagon 27 feet 2 ,, „ 30 feet 3 „ St. Giles Churchyard, circular 5 feet 13 „ special, hexagon and square Meter lamps 45 „ circular, with one 4'2 incandescent burner 19 „ square, with 2 3'2 incandescent burners The amount paid for gas, including lighting and extinguishing, and the cleansing and maintenance of the lanterns, was £4,764 6s. 7d. 70 Incandescent Lighting. The experiment in incandescent gas lighting commenced by your Board in Gower Street, in February, 1899, was continued during the year, and further experiments made in Bedford Square and Montague Place, which were the subject of a long report by your Engineer on the 6th April, 1900, now under the consideration of your Works Committee. The public lighting of Shaftesbury Avenue from Great St. Andrew Street to Cambridge Circus being considered ineffective, your Board resolved to improve the same by placing eight additional lamp posts in the street, fitting the whole with the Welsbacli incandescent burner. The work was completed on the 6th March, 1900. Underground Wires. The National Telephone Company having obtained the permission of this Board, laid the following additional short lengths of pipe under the public ways to carry their wires :—In High Holborn, from the east boundary of the District to Tichborne Court; in Newton Street, from High Holborn to the premises No. 6, Newton Street. Hydraulic Power Mains. Cast-iron pipes for the supply of hydraulic pressure have been laid during the year in the following streets in the District by the London Hydraulic Power Company, Limited, permission to do so having been first obtained by the Company from the Board: — High Holborn, from Southampton Row to No. 126. Hart Street, from New Oxford Street to St. George's Church. New Oxford Street from Tottenham Court Road to Shaftesbury Avenue. 71 Street Refuges. No additional street refuges were formed during year. The following is a list of those now existing in the District:— Bedford Place south end. Broad Street east of Endell Street. Charing Cross Road north end, by High Street. Do. by New Compton Street.

This last refuge has recently, by the alteration in the paving made by the London County Council in carrying out the Boziers Court Improvement, been shifted over the boundary line of the District, and placed in St. Marylebone Parish. Your Board, on the application of the Guardians of the Poor and the Commissioners of Baths and Washhouses of St. Giles, consented to the closing of Lascelles Place as a public way. Lascelles Court has also been allowed to be closed on the application of the adjacent owner. The paving materials, street lamps, and other works, the property of your Board will, at the proper time be removed to your Stone Yard. The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association having enquired whether the Board was prepared to take over and maintain the cattle trough and drinking fountains in the District which were then maintained by the Association, your Board, after due Closing Public Ways. Drinking Fountains. 73 sideration, resolved to take over the maintenance of the fountains, seeing that they were originally maintained by the Board, but declined to take over the trough in Broad Street. The fountains were at the time in good repair, except that in Endell Street against the wall of St. Giles Workhouse, which was repaired at the Board's expense. The fountains are now daily cleaned by a workman of the Board—the water is supplied by the New River Company gratuitously.

The Cattle Drinking Trough, which had been in existence for a number of years in Broad Street, opposite the National Schools, was found to cause such inconvenience and damage, that the Board called upon the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, to whom it belonged, to remove it, which they did, and the Board has since placed a water post with pails for the use of horses on the site. Widening of Shorts Gardens. In continuation of my report of last year on this subject —the premises of the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity 74 Supply Corporation Limited being completed, the land purchased by the Board has been thrown into the public way and paved over, and the widened street was openedto the public on the 4th May, 1900.

TO THE BOARD OB WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Bood and Drugs Acts during the year ended the 31st March, 1900. The total number of samples examined during the twelve months was 444—rather fewer than in the preced- The whole of the samples submitted to me during the year were purchased by the Board's Inspectors, Messrs. William Henry Bond and John Robinson, who handed to me 225 and 219 samples respectively. In the following table will be found a summary of the ing year. The totals for the previous seven years were as follows:— 1892-3 220 1893-4 266 1894-5 348 1895-6 318 1896-7 375 1897-8 406 1898-9 469 78 articles analysed during each quarter of the year and their nature and quality.

The percentage of these samples was 12.7, a considerable increase for the preceding year, when the number was only 7.9. The nature and amount of the adulteration in each case were as follows :— No. of Sample. Nature and Amount of Adulteration. 1st Quarter (ending 30th June, 1899).

The two samples to which boracic acid had been added contained respectively 37.5 and 60.7 grains per gallon. Boracic acid is used as a preservative. During the year the Chemists of the Government Laboratory have given up the use of their old standard (2.75 per cent.) for fat in milk, and have adopted that recommended some years ago by the Society of Public Analysts, namely 3.0 per cent., thus coming into line with the great majority of Public Analysts. As the Board are aware, the new Sale of Food and Drugs Act came into operation on the 1st of January last. By section 4 of this Act the Board of Agriculture are empowed to make regulations determining the standard to be adopted in regard to the composition of Milk, Cream, Butter and Cheese. As a first step a committee has been appointed by the Board of Agriculture, and is now engaged in collecting evidence upon the subject. A departmental committee appointed by the Looal Goverment Board is also considering the important question of the addition of preservatives and colouring matters to articles of food. At the present time there is much difference of opinion amongst chemists as to the injurious character or otherwise of many of the substances now in use. Cream. The whole of the samples of Cream were certified to be adulterated, as Boracic Acid was found to be present in every one, the quantity varying from 9.31 to 63.14 grains per lb. 81 Spirits. The following spirits were found to be unduly diluted with water:— Brandy No. G266 27.07 degrees nnder proof. Gin „ G260 3948 do. do. Whisky „ G230 2676 do. do. By Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act, Brandy, Whiskey and Rum may be reduced to 25 degrees under proof, and Gin to 35 degrees under proof. Bread, Butter, &c. The remaining samples were all certified to be "not adulterated" and were for the most part of good quality. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report upon the Sanitary Condition and Vital Statistics of the District, for the Registration Year ending the 31st December, 1899, a period of fifty-two weeks; the arrangement is the same as that of previous years. Area. The St. Giles District comprises an area of 244 Statute acres, nearly equally divided between the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury. Prior to the first of November last, the district was formed for civil registration purposes into three sub-districts viz.:—St. George, Bloomsbury, St. Giles, South, and St. Giles, North; since that date it has been divided into two sub-districts only, for, by an Order of the Registrar-General made under the provisions of the 21st section of the 37th and 38th Vic. Cap. 88, as from the 1st November, 1899, the 85 Registration sub-district of St. Giles, South, has been abolished, and that part of the parish of St. Giles-in-theFields, which formerly constituted that sub-district, has been added to the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The district therefore will in future be known as Bloomsbury and St. Giles, South. For statistical purposes during the period covered by this report, the birth, death, marriage and other rates will be calculated as heretofore. Houses. The number of inhabited houses at the Census 1891 was returned as 3,729 with an average number of persons in each house of 10.2. Population. The enumerated population in the St. Giles District according to the Census 1896, was 38,237 made up as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 16,110 St. Giles, South 12,976 St. Giles, North 9,151 38,237 Marriages and Marriage-rate. 1899. Population (Census 1896). Number of Marriages. Marriage- rate per 1,000. St. Giles District 38,237 366 19.1 The marriages during the year were 366, compared with 415, 440 and 415 in the three preceding years. 86 The 732 persons married were equal to a marriage-rate of 19.1 per 1,000, a rate of 0.5 per 1,000 higher than that of the average rate for 10 years 1889-98. The marriages were celebrated in the undermentioned churches, chapels, &c., registered for the purpose. » Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. Parish Church, St. Giles-in-the-Fields Established Church 71 Parish Church, St. George, Bloomsbury Ditto 88 Holy Trinity Church, Little Queen Street Ditto 23 Christ Church, Woburn Square Ditto 24 Sardinia Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 24 Bloomsbury Chapel, Shaftesbury Avenue Baptist 7 Little Wild Street Chapel Ditto 2 Kingsgate Street Chapel Ditto — Soho Chapel, Shaftesbury Avenue Ditto 1 Keppel Street Chapel Ditto 1 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan 4 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church - District Register Office, 57, Broad Street ... Civil 121 Total number of Marriages 366 Of these marriages there were celebrated— 206 by the Established Church. 24 at the Roman Catholic Chapel. 15 at other Nonconformist places of worship. 121 at the District Register Office. In London the marriages during the year numbered 41,853, and the proportion of persons married was 18.4 per 1,000 of the population. In England and Wales the marriage-rate was equal to 16.5 per 1,000, the highest rate since 1876. 87 Births and Birth-rates. Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1896). Number of Births. Ratio of Births to Population Birth - rate per 1,000. St. George, Bloomsbury 16,110 256 1 in 62.9 15.8 St. Giles, South 12,976 644 1 in 20.1 49.6 St Giles, North 9,151 232 1 in 39.4 25.3 St. Giles District 38,237 1,132 1 in 33.7 29.6 According to this table there were 1,132 births registered during the year; of these 593 were males and 539 females. The registered births were 384 in excess of the corrected deaths. The birth-rate of the district for the year was 29.6 per 1,000, a rate 2.8 per 1,000 higher than that of the preceding year. The birth-rate of the whole parish of St. Giles-in-theFields was 39.5, a rate more than double of that for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The large number of births in the Great Wild Street block of Peabody Buildings again largely contributed to the high birth-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields The number of births registered in all London was 133,120, giving a rate of 29.4 per 1,000 of the population. This is the lowest birth-rate on record, the natural increment of the population by excess of births over deaths was 43,431, the average increment in the preceding years having been 47,836 per annum. (Registrar-General's Annual Summary). The birth-rate in England and Wales in 1899 was 29.3 88 per 1,000 of the population, which is lower than that in any other year on record, a decrease of 1.0 per 1,000 of the ten years' average. The excess of births over deaths was 346,816. Deaths and Death-rates. Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1896). Begistered Deaths. Deaths (corrected). Ratio of Deaths to Population Deathrate per 1,000. St. George, Bloomsbury 16,110 148 200 1 in 80.5 12.4 St. Gilen, South 12,976 306 395 1 in 32.8 30.4 St. Giles, North 9,151 140 153 1 in 59.8 16.7 St. Giles District 38,2:17 594 748 1 in 51.1 19.5 The deaths registered in St. Giles District during the year were:— Males 309 Females 285 Total 594 The 594 registered deaths will not give a true rate, and must be altered by the addition of 216 deaths of parishioners in outlying hospitals and public institutions, and the subtraction of 62 deaths of non-parishioners at the French Hospital, the Parish Workhouse, and the British Lying-in Hospital, public institutions situated inside the District. The corrections will be found in the above table, from which it will be seen that the annual death-rate of the District was equal to a rate of 19.5 per 1,000, the same rate as that of the preceding year; both rates were 1.6 below decennial average. The death-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields 89 was again very much higher than the rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. In London the deaths of 89,689, persons were registered, equal to an annual rate of 19.8 per 1,000, the average rate in the ten years being 19.6 per 1,000. In England and Wales the deaths of 581,824 persons were registered, corresponding to a death-rate of 18.3 per 1,000, a rate of 0.l below the average rate in the ten years 1889-98. Infantile Mortality. 201 children died before they reached five years of age, against 243 recorded for the preceding year. 136 were infants under one year. The deaths of children under one year per 1,000 of registered births were 120, against 153 for the year 1898. The diseases which were specially fatal to children in this district, were "diarrhœa and enteritis (inflammation of the bowels)" 43, "bronchitis and pneumonia" 32, "atrophy and debility" 26, "scrofulous diseases" 21, measles" 15, "prematurity" accounted for 18, and 6 were accidentally suffocated in bed with their parents. In England and Wales the rate of mortality among infants under one year of age to registered births was 163. Senile Mortality. The deaths amongst people at advanced ages were as follows:— 90 46 between 65 and 70 years. 70 „ 70 „ 80 „ 35 „ 80 „ 90 „ 1 at 90 years. 1 at 96 years. 1 at 98 years. a total of 154 deaths, of which 45 occurred at the Workhouse. 47 were certified as having died from "old age and decay of nature," and the remainder from diseases, chiefly of the heart and lungs. Certification of Causes of Death. Of the deaths registered in this District the causes were certified by registered Medical Practitioners, or by Coroners after inquest in every instance. This is the fifth year in succession that no death in St. Giles District has been returned as "uncertified." In London, of the 89,689 deaths registered, 530, or 0.6 per cent were uncertified, being equal to the proportion uncertified in each of the three preceding years. In England and Wales, 10,647 cases, or 1.8 per cent., causes were not certified. Deaths in Public Institutions (within the District). 1.—The Parish Workhouse, Endell Street. During 1899, the number of inmates was 597. The number of deaths during the year amongst them was as follows:— 1st Quarter 34 2nd Quarter 34 3rd Quarter 31 4th Quarter 35 134 91 This equals an annual death-rate of 22.4 per 1,000. The 50 deaths at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum areexcluded from this calculation. The only disease notified was erysipelas, of which there was 12 cases. 2.—The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. The number of deaths in the Hospital during the year was 39. Of these 38 were non-parishioners, brought in for treatment from various parts of London. There was only one infantile death, and no death from zymotic disease. The majority of the deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65, and were chiefly caused from diseases of the heart and lungs. 3.—The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. The Hospital Staff, in their annual Report to the Committee of Management, state that during the year 331 women were delivered in the wards without any maternal death, and during the same period there was an entire absence of puerperal fever. The total number of children delivered was 333, two of the labours resulting in twin birth. One of the children was still-born, and 12 of the infants died from convulsions and prematurity. In the out-patient department 419 were delivered in their own homes. Operative assistance was necessary in fourteen cases,, and of these death resulted in two instances. Twins occurred four times and triplets once. Ten infants were born dead. 92 Deaths in Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums, Workhouse Infirmaries, and other places situated outside the District. According to the weekly returns furnished to me from the Registrar-General's Office, Somerset House, 216 Parishioners, belonging to the united parishes of St. Grilesin-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, died in the following outlying public Institutions:— These deaths are included in Table III.

The vital statistics of this block of buildings in 1899 are shown as follows:— Great Wild Street Block. 1899. Decennial average 1889-98. Above Decennial Average. Below Decennial Average. Birth-rate 35.7 38.8 - 3.1 Death-rate 16.0 17.6 - 1.6 Zymotic death-rate 1.4 3.8 - 2.4 The number of inmates in 1899 was 1,371; of these 217 were children under 5 years. There were 49 children born, equal to a birth-rate of 35.7 per 1,000. The 22 deaths corresponded to an annual death-rate of 16.0 per 1,000. Of these 6 were children under 5 years of age, 2 being infants under 1. There were only two zymotic deaths, both from infantile diarrhœa. It will be seen from the table above that these rates were below the average. 10 notifications were received, viz., 7 scarlet fever and 3 erysipelas. 4 of the deaths occurred in Public Hospitals. 94 B.—The Herbrand Street Block. (formerly named the Little Coram Street Block.) Superintendent, Mr. Snelling. The vital statistics of this block are shown as under:— Herbrand Street Block. 1899. Decennial Average 1889-98.

There were 36 births, equal to the high birth-rate of 50.0 per 1,000; the 7 deaths were equal to the correspondingly low death-rate of 9.7 per 1,000. 3 of the deaths were children under 5 years. 2 were zymotic deaths, viz., enteric fever and diarrhoea. 11 notifications were received, viz., scarlet fever 10, and erysipelas 1. It is stated in the thirty-fifth annual report of the Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund that the net gain of the year from rents and interest of the whole of their buildings has been £35,183 17s. 2d. The total fund on the 31st December last was £1,291,351. The capital expenditure on land and buildings to the end of the year was £1,285,107 2s. 7d. The trustees had provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London 11,367 rooms, besides bath rooms, laundries, and lavatories, these comprised 5,121 separate dwellings, viz., 100 of four rooms, 1,767 of three rooms, 2,412 of two rooms, and 842 of one room. 95 The average weekly earnings of the head of each family was £1 3s. 0½d. The average rent of each dwelling was 5s. (0½d. a week, and of each room 2s. 31/4d. The mean population during the year was 19,157, showing a density of 702 people to the acre, or nearly twelve times that of London. The birth-rate for the year reached 32.8 per 1,000, which is 3.4 per 1,000 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate, including the deaths of 68 inhabitants of the buildings who were removed to hospitals, was 16.7, per 1,000, which is 3.1 per 1,000 below the average of London. The infantile mortality was 127*2 in each 1,000 births, or 40-2 below that of London. II.—Buildings belonging to the Incorporated Society for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes.

Class 1.—Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases. This class of diseases, called "Zymotic," comprises, in the Registrar-General's arrangement of the causes of death, six orders. The first and second orders ("miasmatic" and "diarrhœal") include the diseases which the Registrar-General describes as the seven principal diseases of the zymotic class; the term "fever" includes "typhus," "enteric or typhoid" and "simple continued forms of fever." The zymotic death-rate is made up from these seven diseases, as they are considered to be more or less of a preventable character. In St. Giles District there were 5.5 deaths, equal to a zymotic death-rate of per 1,000, against 1.8 per 1,000 for the preceding three years. In all London, 11,228 deaths were referred to these diseases, which were equal to an annual rate of 2.48 per 1,000. It is stated that the mortality in London during 1899 from zymotic diseases was, in the aggregate, more than 9 per cent. below the average. In England and Wales 69,820 deaths were attributed to them, corresponding to a rate of 2.21 per 1,000 living. 101 MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—Small-Pox (decennial average, 0.6). Year. No. of Notifications Received. Removals to Hospitals. No. of Deaths. 1899 — — — Again, in 1899 no case of small-pox was reported in the district; the last case notified was in 1895. The prevalence of small-pox in London showed a further decline during 1899, the new cases notified being only 29, against 979, 225, 104, and 32 in the four preceding years. The number of small-pox patients admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals during 1899 was 18. In all London there were three deaths from it, against 55, 9, 16, and 1 in the four preceding years. 102 Return Respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were Registered in 1898. Registration SubDistricts, comprised in Vaccination Officer's District. Number of Births returned in Birth List Sheets, as registered from 1st January to 31st December 1898.

In 1899, there was again an epidemic from measles in the Metropolis, and 2,143 deaths were referred to it. In St. Giles District, the deaths were 16, all young children. In November the disease was at its height and one of the elementary schools adjoining the district, where many of the children of parishioners attended, had to be temporarily closed in consequence. Upon my reporting this outbreak to your Sanitary Committee the following resolutions were adopted:— 1. "That the proposal of the Medical Officer of Health to address a communication to the Head Masters and Head Mistresses of Elementary schools in the district on the subject of the prevalence of measles be approved." The following is a copy of the letter addressed to the Teachers accordingly:— Dear Madam (or Sir), At the present time measles is very prevalent in this district and its immediate neighbourhood. I have been enquiring into the matter, and find that there are a large number of children attending school from the infected houses. You are no doubt aware that measles is not a disease which is compulsorily notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and therefore very great difficulty is experienced in ascertaining the existence of cases. May I suggest that with a view of co-operating with the Board in the matter you should, in any case in which it comes to your knowledge that measles has broken out, exclude from attendance at school all children coming from infected families ? So far as cases in this District are concerned, I shall feel obliged by your sending me information of all of which you may become aware. I enclose a list, which I have had prepared, of the premises in this District, where, at the present date, measles is known to exist. I am, dear Madam (or Sir), Yours faithfully, (Signed) S. R. LOVETT. Medical Officer of Health. 104 2. "That a hand-bill containing information and suggestions to parents on the subject of the treatment of measles be printed and issued." This hand-bill was as follows:— THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Measles. Measles at the present time being very prevalent in the District the Sanitary Committee of the Board has directed me to call the attention of parents and guardians to the importance of checking the spread of the disease, which otherwise is likely to cause serious mortality amongst young children. The first symptoms of Measles are running at the eyes and nose, with repeated sneezing, and a puffy appearance of the face and eyelids, followed in a few days with a rash which is raised and red or purple in colour. All children developing these symptoms should be at once isolated, even before the eruption appears. The sick child should be confined to bed from the first symptom of illness, and kept warm. Medical aid should be at once obtained as there is great danger of bronchitis and lung complications, which being frequently overlooked, cause death. It is very advisable that all children from an infected family should be kept away from school until the sick child is convalescent. The patient is usually well in about fourteen days from the appearance of the rash. S. R. LOVETT, Medical Officer of Health. 3. "That the attention of the Local Government Board be again directed to the fact that no steps have yet been taken by that board for including measles in the list of diseases notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891." 105 3.—Scarlet Fever (decennial average 5-0). Year. No. of Notifications received. Removals to Hospitals. No. of Deaths in Hospitals. No. of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1899 76 57 — — — There was no death reported from scarlet fever during the year. There were 76 notifications, and 57 removals to the Asylums Board and general hospitals. The fatal cases of scarlet fever in all London were 398, being 557 below the corrected average number. 4.—"Whooping-Cough (decennial average 17.1). The 1,720 fatal cases in all London were 718 below the corrected average number. In St. Giles District there was only one death from this disease. 5.—Diarrhœa (decennial average 20.9). The 30 deaths in 1899 included those of 25 children under 5 years of age. In addition, 18 children died from enteritis (inflammation of the stomach and bowels) the most prominent symptom of the disease being diarrhoea. In July the Royal College of Physicians of London, at the request of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, appointed a Committee to consider the certification and classification of deaths from diarrhœa. The Committee found on enquiry that many different terms were employed to designate the disease officially known as "epidemic diarrhoea" whereby its specific character was in danger of being ignored. 106 The recommendation of the Committee adopted by the College was "to authorise the use of the term 'epidemic enteritis' (or if preferred by the practitioner 'zymotic enteritis') as a synonym for epidemic diarrhœa, and to urge the entire disuse, as synonyms of epidemic diarrhœa, in medical certificates of death of such terms as 'gastroenteritis,' 'muco-enteritis,' or 'gastric-catarrh.'" The present confusion of terms vitiates the diarrhœa mortality returns, and renders it impossible to determine accurately the prevalence of the disease in special places, or at special times, the extent to which it influences public health in general, and the effects produced by sanitary measures. The 4,196 fatal cases of diarrhœa in all London were as many as 930 above the corrected average. 6.—Diphtheria (decennial average 11.9). Year. No. of Notifications received.

The Act to extend the infectious diseases notification Act of 1899 to places which have not already adopted it, came into force on the 1st January, 1900, and will take effect in every Urban, Rural and Port Sanitary district in which it has not yet been adopted. In St. Giles District during the past year 201 108 tificates, including 17 duplicates, were received from Medical Practitioners; the numbers are scheduled under the heading of their several diseases as follows. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Membranous Croup. Typhus Fever. Enteric Fever. Other continued Fevers. Puerperal Fever. Erysipelas. Cholera. Total.

N.B.—In any case of failure to remove on the day of application, in consequence of pressure on the accommodation in the Board's Hospitals, the application must be renewed every morning so long as the patient continues in a fit state for removal and removal is desired. Each application must contain a statement of the circumstances which render the removal urgent. Similar applications must be made in respect of patients taken from General Hospitals or other places to their homes, owing to there being no vacant bed available in the Board's Hospitals.

N.B.—PENALTY—by Section 70 of the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," it is enacted that — "It shall not be lawful for any owner or driver of a public conveyance knowingly to convey, or for any other person knowingly to place in any public conveyance, a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disease, or for a person suffering from any such disease to enter any public conveyance, and if he does so he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding TEN POUNDS. OTHER MIASMATIC DISEASES. Influenza. In 1899, influenza was fatal in 17 cases, 2 children and 15 adults; the deaths in the preceding three years being 1 in 1896, 6 in 1897, and 12 in 1898. In addition to these 17 cases, many of the deaths certified as bronchitis and pneumonia were more or less connected with this disease. In all London the deaths referred to influenza during 1899, numbered 1,817, which is the highest number recorded since 1895. 112 The Plague in the East. During the year there has been a prevalence of the disease in Portugal, India, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Siberia, Madagascar and South America. In conformity with the General Order of the Local Government Board as to regulations respecting cholera, plague and yellow fever, I received on the 22nd of August, a notification from the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of Bristol, that Mr. Ruddock had arrived there by the S.S. Douro from Oporto, where cases of bubonic plague had occurred, and that on landing at the Port he had proceeded to No. 57, Guilford Street, in this District. Upon receipt of this information I visited Mr. Ruddock, and found him to be apparently in good health. As he was journeying to Glasgow, I reported the matter to the Medical Officer of Health of that City. II.—Constitutional and Tubercular Diseases. The division of diseases in this class includes cancer, phthisis, (consumption of the lungs) and other forms of tuberculosis and scrofula. The total deaths were 175, a number 33 less than in 1898. Phthisis was again the most fatal disease of the year, it caused 114 deaths, 107 occurring at adult ages. The Council of the National Association for the prevention of Consumption and other forms of tuberculosis have resolved to take the initiative in promoting a congress to be held in London in the Spring of 1901, and have announced that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales has graciously accepted the Presidency, and has expressed his intention of opening it in person. The movement has been widely taken up, and has received the active support of many public 113 authorities, societies, and private persons all over the country. In my Annual Report for the year 1896, pages 99-100, will be found the suggested precautions to be taken for the prevention of propagation of consumption and tubercular diseases. In Registration London phthisis was the assigned cause of 8,510 deaths. III.—Local Diseases. The diseases in this class, comprising eleven orders, named after the organs to which the diseases relate, were accountable for 400 deaths, being more than half of the total number of deaths recorded for the year. IV.—Sudden and Violent Deaths. Inquests. Coroner: Dr. Gr. P. Danford Thomas. Office: 87, Euston Road, N.W. Inquiry Officer: Mr. John Bryant, 7, Cobden Buildings, King's Cross Road, N.W.

Accident. The Public Mortuary, Goldsmith Street. 81 bodies were brought into the Mortuary during the past year; of these 11 were non-parishioners, who died in public institutions situated inside the district. Post mortem examinations were made in 42 cases. No body was deposited after death from infectious disease. 115 Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. (53 & 54 Vict., cap. 70.) The proceedings taken by the Board under this Act during the past year were as follows:— The premises No. 29, compton Street, closed in 1896, have been repaired, reopened, and now form part of No. 27. No. 16, Drury Lane, and 22, Short's Gardens, closed in the same year, have been demolished, and are now occupied as an Electric Light Station. No. 2, Wild Court, closed in 1896, has been repaired and reopened. No. 66, Castle Street, closed in 1897, has been repaired and reopened. During the past year, No. 40, Sardinia Street, has been closed, repaired, and reopened. The Cottage in rear of No. 22, Little Wild Street, has been closed. These make a total of 154 premises dealt with in this District since the passing of the Act. Water Supply—New Buildings.

Sanitary Congress at Blackpool. Mr. James Smith, member of your Board, your Clerk and myself, attended the Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health, which was held at Blackpool from the 21st to the 28th September last. There was a large attendance of Delegates from all parts of the country. The Patrons were the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Derby, K.G., Lord Lieutenant of the County of Lancaster, and the Rt. Hon. Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart., M.P., Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Honorary President was Alderman Heap, J.P., Mayor of Blackpool, and the President of the Congress was the Most Honourable the Marquis of Lorne, K.T., G.C.M.G., M.P. The Vice-Presidents included the Lord Mayors of Dublin, York, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and Sheffield, and the Lord Provosts of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and many of the Mayors of the principal towns. The Presidential address was given by the Marquis of Lorne, who afterwards opened the Health Exhibition at Raikes Park. Papers were read and discussed in the various sections as follows: "The Causation and Prevention of Diarrhoea in Children and Adults;" "The Responsibilities of Sanitary 119 Authorities of Health Resorts;" "County Council Health Lectures;" "Smoke Production and Abatement;" "The Pollution of the Atmosphere of Large Towns;" "Coal Smoke and the Public Health;" "The Purification of Sewage by Microbes;" "The Destruction of Town Refuse;" "Cremation;" "Local Indebtedness: Its Growth, Purpose, Cost and Redemption;" "The Charge of Children during Infancy;" "Physical Training, a National Necessity;" "The Influence of Personal Hygiene on General Sanitation;" "On Tuberculosis in Man;" "The Advantages of Medical Inspection of Children in Public Elementary Schools;" "Some Defects of Local Government;" "The Duties of the Community as regards the Isolation and Treatment of Infectious Diseases;" "Physical Training;" "The Treatment of Sewage;" "The Humidity and Ventilation of Factories;" "The Warming and Ventilation of Industrial Buildings;" "The Codification of the Public Health Laws;" "The Law as to Sanitary Conveniences;" "The Sanitation of the Mosaic Law;" "The Unification of Rating;" "Isolation Hospitals;" "Recent Legislation with respect to Defective Children;" "The Control of the Milk Supply;" "The Administrative Uses of Bacteriology;" "The Notification of Measles;" "The Effects of Recent Legislation on Vaccination;" "The Measures to be taken for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in the lower Animals, and its spread by Milk and Meat to Human Beings;" "The Value of Tuberculin in the Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Cattle;" "Measures to be taken for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in Cattle;" "The Prevention of Tuberculosis;" "The Sanitation of Agricultural Buildings." Several other papers were withdrawn or taken as read on account of the shortness of time. 120 The following resolutions passed at the several Sections were submitted to the General Meeting of the Congress and adopted. "That in the opinion of this meeting the time has arrived when the Government should either undertake the control of the Smoke Nuisance, or adopt some other means of securing effective administration of the law relating to smoke by County Councils or Joint Boards." "That the Congress be recommended to Memorialise the Presidents of the Local Government Boards of England, Scotland, and Ireland to adopt means for providing for Sanitary Inspectors possessing the Certificate of Competency of the Sanitary Inspectors' Examination Board." "That Cremation is the most Sanitary Method for the disposal of the dead, and that it is desirable to erect Crematoria in the neighbourhood of thickly populated districts, and that facilities should be given to governing bodies for that purpose, and that it be a recommendation to the Congress that a copy of this resolution be sent to the President of the Local Government Board." "That the Congress be recommended to protest against the policy of the Local Government Board in fixing time limits for the repayment of loans without proper regard to the permanence of the undertakings for which the loans were raised. "That it be a recommendation from this meeting to the General Meeting of the Congress of the Institute to consider the best means of attaining a satisfactory Codification and Amendment of Public Health Legislation, and to take practical steps to carry this recommendation into effect." "That this meeting is of opinion that the present state of the Law on Sanitary Conveniences is unsatisfactory, and that it be a recommendation to the General Meeting of the Congress to pass a resolution calling the attention of the Local Government Board to the defects in the statutory provisions as complicated by recent judicial decisions, with a view to remedial legislation." "That the Congress be recommended to forward to the President of the Local Government Board and the Rating Commission a resolution in support of giving Rating Powers to Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils instead of Guardians, and that with this view the duties of the Overseers as regards financial matters should cease, the geographical county being adopted as the regulation area, and not the administration county." 121 Sanitary Work. There will be found in Table VI., Appendix, a Summary of the Sanitary Work carried out during the year, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878 to 1891. Inspections and Orders. The Sanitary Inspectors made 10,777 visits and inspections and served 1,117 notices for the abatement of various kinds of nuisances, and the sanitary amendments of houses and premises. Proceedings before Police Magistrates. In the majority of cases the Board's Orders served by the Inspectors were promptly attended to, but in 32 instances where the owners failed to abate the nuisances complained of, proceedings were taken before the Magistrates at the Bow Street Police Court to enforce compliance with the Orders. Convictions with costs were obtained in every case. Overcrowding. 25 notices were served upon owners to reduce the number of persons living in rooms in which the cubic space was insufficient. Considering the difficulty experienced by the poor in obtaining suitable accommodation in Central Districts of London, near their work, it is surprising that the amount of overcrowding is not greater. Underground Rooms. 6 underground dwellings were found to be illegally occupied, but on notice being served on the owners, steps were taken to cause the rooms to be vacated or to be occupied in conjunction with other rooms in the same house. 122 Unsound Food. During the hot weather in the Autumn large quantities of unsound food were brought to the Stone Yard to be destroyed. Amongst these were about 6 tons of fruit, several parcels of fish, and a quantity of various kinds of vegetables. Animals Improperly Kept. From time to time during the year the Inspectors found a number of rabbits, fowls and dogs improperly kept so as to be a nuisance or injurious to health. In addition to these, complaint was made of a nuisance caused by a number of performing pigs which were being kept in a stable in the District. Upon notices being served on the owners all these animals were promptly removed. Factories and Workshops. Summary of "Work done during 1899 under the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878-1895, and under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, so far as it relates to Factories, Workshops and Workplaces:— Number of "Workshops visited and inspected 109 Number of Workshops registered during the year 109 No. of Persons employed in such Workshops Males 94 Females 70 Young Persons 29 193 No. of Orders served:— Water closet accommodation 10 Dirty condition of premises 21 Overcrowding 1 32 Number of notices sent to H.M.

Inspector of Factories as to overcrowding and insanitary condition of Workshops 2 123 Slaughter-House. At a meeting of the Public Health Committee of the London County Council, held in November, a license was renewed for a slaughter-house to Mr. William Kingmill, No. 23, Store Street. Cowshed. At the same meeting a license for a cowshed was renewed to Mr. E. Jones, No. 4, Goldsmith Street, for nine Cows. Previous to the licensing meeting your Clerk was directed by the Sanitary Committee to intimate to the Medical Officer of the Council that as the licensees seemed to have complied with the Regulations of the Council, they did not see any justification for offering opposition to the renewal of the licenses; but while the Committee adopted this course, they directed the Clerk to refer to their resolutions passed during the last few years, that in the opinion of the Board it is extremely undesirable that these Cow and Slaughter-houses should be perpetuated and permitted to exist in crowded districts in the Metropolis. Section 26.—Bakehouses. The following 24 bakehouses were inspected from time to time during the year, and were generally found to be kept in a cleanly and sanitary condition: 124 Bakehouses—continued. PARISH OF ST.

Owing to the impending changes in the District consequent upon the coming into force of the London Government Act, 1899, this will probably be the last Annual Report that I shall have the honour of submitting to your Board, and it gives me a fitting opportunity to express my deep obligations for the kind and courteous treatment which I have received during the many years I have been Medical Officer of Health of the District.
