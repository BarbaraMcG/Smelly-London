FIFE (Resigned December, 1960) (Rodent operative) 7 To the Chairman and Members of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, In this the seventh report I have made to you, I should like to commence by referring to what may well be called some lucky escapes. The dangers which have been escaped during the year include anterior poliomyelitis, diphtheria and many accidents which human carelessness and frailty had made likely. The lucky element comes in when one considers how little forethought is given to the prevention of these calamities by quite a high proportion of our population. In the absence of cases of poliomyelitis and diphtheria, it is difficult to persuade people to be protected against these diseases, yet it must be obvious to all that such a time is an ideal one for taking the necessary precautions. Although the number of accidents, other than motor vehicle ones, showed a slight reduction, the figure of seven is still too high, but one realises only too well that but for lucky escapes, this figure would inevitably have been much higher. It seems that so little thought is given to safety in the home, simply because the word "home" is associated with a kindly security which is in fact very often far from being a fact. While on the subject of home hazards, the opportunity must not be lost of drawing attention to the risks of suffocation attendant upon wrongful use of thin polythene film. This material which does the job for which it is manufactured so splendidly, can be a menace if after its use, it is left about for babies or young children to play with, and it is best destroyed if there is any risk of this happening. The vital statistics do not show a great deal of variation from the previous year, but your attention is drawn to the fact that the number of deaths registered during the year has fallen from 762 to 702, at a time when the population has increased by 730. It is not without interest to study some of the diseases which have been responsible for fewer deaths this year than there were in 1959. It is gratifying to find that both cancer in general and lung cancer showed a fall in the number of deaths, but until a steady year-byyear drop is achieved, too much notice should not be taken of single isolated figures such as these. Respiratory diseases were the other group of illnesses to exact a considerably reduced toll, and these, together with the cancers, were mainly responsible for the more favourable death figures. Infectious disease notifications reached a very low level and one can say that the general physical well-being of the people is very good, but, one wonders what sort of malaise is affecting those who do malicious damage to public conveniences. This damage to public property, and in fact to property belonging to anyone but the perpetrators, is a serious problem which is not of course local 8 only. It would seem that in this field prevention is indeed the only cure, but that a section of the community has grown up so utterly regardless of other people's feelings, is a very sad commentary on the upbringing of some of the present generation. That this love of destruction is the fault of the small minority is admitted, but the damage done by the few can be very devastating, and while such behaviour is rife, we cannot be really satisfied with the public health. The care of the elderly is a problem always exercising the minds of many bodies, both voluntary and official, and it is therefore particularly pleasing to know that Chislehurst and Sidcup Old People's Welfare Committee have now, by virtue of their Boarding Out Scheme, succeeded in placing over 200 elderly persons who have by this action, in many cases, been given a second lease of life. One sincerely hopes to see this work prosper and expand to the great mutual benefit of the old people themselves, and the hospitals and Old People's Homes which might otherwise have to accommodate them. This admittedly is only one of many services now available to elderly persons, but it is surely one of the most useful and progressive. During the year under review, the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the future of Local Government in the Greater London Area, made a report which, if implemented by the Government, could have very important and far-reaching effects for the Health Committee of this Local Authority. In effect, this Council would be merged with an adjoining one to form a Greater London Borough, whose Health Committee would exercise most of the functions which are now vested in the Health Committee of the Kent County Council. If the Commission's proposals are adopted, the few health functions not exercised by the Greater London Borough would be provided by the projected Greater London Council. At the time of writing, the Government have not revealed their intentions in this matter, but it is anticipated that a decision will have been arrived at long before the next Annual Report is due. My deputy, Dr. Kelynack has worked with his usual conscientious thoroughness, and I am deeply grateful to him for his devoted service. I must also thank Mr. Kermode the Chief Public Health Inspector for his unfailing efficiency and meticulous attention to detail; the other Inspectors and the clerical staff have all made their contributions to the successful running of the Department, and I should like to thank them as well. My final words of thanks are to express my gratitude to all my professional colleagues in other branches of medicine, for their unfailing kindliness and courtesy during the year, and to the 9 Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee who, by their interest and enthusiasm make one feel that the job is well worth doing. I am, Your obedient Servant, H. B. C. CARTER-LOCKE, Medical Officer of Health SECTION A. VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. 12 SECTION A.

The Registrar General's estimate of the total population of the Urban District, mid-year 1960, was 89,750, which is an increase of 730 over the figure for the previous year. This population figure gives a density of 10.02 persons to the acre. 14 The natural increase of population, measured by excess of births over deaths was 625. Next year, being a Census year, we should receive an accurate figure of the population and many other interesting pieces of information. BIRTHS. 1,327 live births were registered during the year, as compared with 1,271 in 1959. The birth rate for 1960 was 14.8 per 1,000 total population. The adjusted rate for comparison with other areas being 14.3. Of the births registered, 698 were males and 629 females. The rate of 14.8 is .5 higher than that for the year 1959, but is well below the figure of 17.1 which is the rate for England and Wales as a whole. 3.8% of the total number of live births were illegitimate, 51 such births being registered, 29 males and 22 females. 31 stillbirths were registered, giving a rate of 0.35 per 1,000 estimated total population, and 22.8 per 1,000 total live and still births. 14 of the stillbirths were males and 17 females. DEATHS. 702 deaths appertaining to the Urban District were registered during 1960, giving a Death Rate of 7.8 per 1,000 total population. The adjusted rate for use when comparing one area with another is 10.1. The rate for England and Wales as a whole is 11.5. Of the deaths registered, 334 were males and 368 females. The following is an analysis of the ages at death : Under 1 year of age 23 1 and under 5 years of age 1 5 and under 15 years of age 3 15 and under 25 years of age 8 25 and under 35 years of age 8 35 and under 45 years of age 24 45 and under 55 years of age 54 55 and under 65 years of age 119 65 and under 75 years of age 172 75 years of age and over 290 702 Full details of the causes of death will be found in Table II in the appendix to this report, but the following table, giving details of certain causes of death in the Urban District during the past ten years, may prove of interest:— 15  1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 Cancer of the lung, bronchus 22 21 38 36 44 31 34 41 42 34 Cancer (all sites) 132 127 154 149 157 127 151 156 179 140 Respiratory Diseases (non T.B.) 89 72 80 73 87 88 99 96 103 70 Tuberculosis 30 22 20 14 7 11 8 10 6 4 Heart and Circulatory diseases 361 377 325 320 353 329 348 356 367 372 Infectious Diseases 4 4 3 2 2 2 - 1 3 - Road Traffic accidents 6 4 9 5 5 8 8 8 12 9 Other violent causes 12 10 7 9 10 11 13 13 16 17 It is worthy of note that the number of deaths from tuberculosis is the lowest figure yet recorded in the Urban District. MORBIDITY STATISTICS The following is a summary of the weekly details received from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance during 1960:— Four weeks ending Number of First Certificates of incapacity received. 26th January 1,054 23rd February 1,032 22nd March 1,050 19th April 743 17th May 746 14th June 551 12th July 519 9th August 540 6th September 522 4th October 684 1st November 981 29th November 893 27 th December 849 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. 78 members, or potential members of the staff were medically examined during the year. UNEMPLOYMENT. I am indebted to the Manager of the local Employment Exchange for the following information with regard to unemployment in the area during 1960: "Unemployment dropped to its lowest for many years—and averaged 125—which is small compared with the size of the insured population." 16 OPEN AIR RECREATIONAL AMENITIES.

It is therefore of particular importance that facilities should be available for them to obtain outdoor recreation in the summer evenings or on long weekends, which are now available to so many. In this connection, the district is most fortunate. Although urban in character, a significant part lies within the Metropolitan Green Belt, and comprises country lanes, open fields and orchards. Again, the Commons of Chislehurst and St. Paul's Cray bring woodland to the doorsteps of many houses. For those who wish to spend their leisure in more active pursuits, the Council alone provides in its parks and open spaces, no fewer than 26 football pitches, 3 hockey grounds, 18 cricket pitches, 18 tennis courts and 3 netball pitches. 18 For those who wish simply to rest in pleasant surroundings, there is a wealth of lovely parks and gardens, three of which contain aviaries, whilst the provision, during the year, of playground equipment at Riverside Road, brings the total number of parks with this facility to 10. In three of these, Games Wardens are employed and continue to be very popular. The main constructional works carried out during the year, centred on the clearing of undergrowth, levelling and seeding of the woodland area at Hoblingwell Wood, and the completion of the Pavilion at Mottingham Sports Ground. On a smaller scale the planting of roses at the Crescent, Main Road, Sidcup, and The Oval, Blackfen, has been completed. SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. 20 SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. Routine disinfection, after cases of infectious diseases, is now largely a thing of the past. With such diseases as measles and scarlet fever any disinfection can safely be left to the householder, and only in exceptional cases or when special application is made, does the department carry out the work. With more serious infection, the operation is carried out by the department. Rooms and their contents are sprayed with a formaldehyde solution and bedding, which cannot be boiled, is removed to the Main Road, Sidcup Depot, where it is subjected to steam under pressure, before being used again. Public Library books, which have been in contact with patients, are treated in a formalin chamber, before they are permitted to return to circulation. The eradiction of certain types of parasitic vermin is undertaken by the Department. Principal amongst these is the bed bug (Cimex Lectularius). This was a common pest and was notoriously difficult to eradicate until the post-war period when the residual type of insecticide became available. Nowadays, infested rooms and their contents are sprayed with a solution containing D.D.T. together with a quick acting agent. Bedding is still dealt with by steam disinfection. The advanced state of hygiene generally observed in this country and the availability of these sprays, has led to a dramatic decrease in vermin infestation. Some insects have acquired an immunity to particular insecticides and the position still requires watching. Details of work carried out in 1960 are given below:DISINFECTIONS.

Public Conveniences provided in the district fall into two groups. Those separate from Parks are cleaned and maintained by staff attached to the Public Health Department. They are:— Male and Female Sections:— Westwood Lane, Blackfen. St. Johns Road, Sidcup. Queens Head P.H., Chislehurst. Adj. Tigers Head P.H., Chislehurst. Cotmandene Crescent, St. Paul's Cray. Dorset Road, Mottingham. A large group of conveniences are provided principally for the use of persons enjoying the parks, but in several cases they adjoin the highway and are available for passers by. In this category the conveniences forming part of the Pavilion at Mottingham Sports ground were opened during the year. A full list is given below:— Willersley Park, Blackfen. Penhill Park, Blackfen. The Glade, Lamorbey. Waring Park, Sidcup (2) King George's Field, Sidcup. Longlands Recreation Ground, Sidcup. Recreation Ground, St. Paul's Cray. West Chislehurst Sports Ground, Chislehurst. Recreation Ground, Mottingham. Mottingham Sports Ground. Sidcup Place. Sidcup. Conveniences in parks are also the responsibility of the Public Health Department but the men's sections are cleansed by the staff of the particular Park in which they are situated. In 1959 attendants were installed at the conveniences at Westwood Lane, and during the current year this service was also provided at Cotmandene Crescent. Hot water washing facilities are available in these buildings and are appreciated by the public. The Committee is considering whether the hours during which staff are stationed in these buildings is in need of alteration. The present arrangements for manning Westwood Lane and Cotmandene Crescent, necessitates the employment of eight persons working part time. Other conveniences are cleaned by itinerant personnel, consisting of two full timers and one part timer, with a further part time relief worker. Plans for the proposed new convenience to be 22 ted in place of the unsatisfactory structure on the car park at St. John Road, Sidcup, have been agreed and it is hoped that the building will be in use by 1962. Attendants will be stationed here and hot water facilities are to be installed. Conveniences continue to be subject to malicious damage usually of an irresponsible and comparatively minor character. No fewer than 102 items were reported necessitating remedial works costing in all £219. LABORATORY SERVICE. The modern technique of investigating intestinal infections necessitates the bacteriological examination of specimens from patients and of suspected food stuffs. The majority of these are despatched to the Public Health Laboratory at Maidstone, where Dr. J. H. C. Walker, who has been the Director for some years, retired during the period under review. His unsparing keenness and assistance must be recorded at this time. In a few cases, where results are required with more than the usual urgency, specimens have been examined by Dr. Keall of Bromley Hospital, or Dr. Herman the pathologist at Queen Mary's Hospital. The Department is indebted to these gentlemen and their staffs. A decrease in the type of disease mentioned above has resulted in the sending of considerably fewer specimens than for several years past.

Removal of Persons living in Insanitary Conditions. Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the local authority the duty of arranging for compulsory removal of aged or infirm persons in need of care and attention, and unable to provide for themselves. 23 It is pleasing to report that the need to make arrangements of this nature did not arise during the year, although preliminary investigations were made in connection with two elderly people. It is often possible, with the co-operation of other authorities, to alleviate the unhappy circumstances under which some of these unfortunate people are living. Burial of the Dead. Another task placed upon Local Authorities by the National Assistance Act, 1948, is the interment of bodies, when no other arrangements are being made. This too, it is hoped, is a diminishing duty now that Death Grants are available in respect of most people. In 1960 it was not necessary to arrange for any burial. NURSING HOMES. There was no change in the number of registered Nursing Homes during 1960. The Homes were inspected at frequent intervals during the year, but at no time were any contraventions found which called for action on the part of the local authority. In the main, the beds are occupied by aged sick or aged infirm patients. Details of the Homes on the register at 31st Decembebr, 1960, are as under:— Address Number of Beds. "Fallowtield," Ashfield Lane, Chislehurst 40 "Glenthorne," 24, Lower Camden, Chislehurst 12 "Hatherley," 12, Hatherley Road, Sidcup 9 "Redhill House," Redhill, Chislehurst 7 "The Retreat," Lower Camden, Chislehurst 4 PUBLIC MORTUARY. The Mortuary at Chislehurst Depot, which has refrigerated accommodation for six bodies, continues to receive considerable use. Bodies are received, after cases of sudden death, as a sequel to road accidents, and from local hospitals. Post Mortem examinations are performed on each body by the visiting pathologist and, when necessary, the Coroner arranges the inquests in the room provided for that purpose. The work of reception of these bodies, their cleansing, preparation for post mortem and subsequently for the undertakers, forms a considerable part of the duties of the Disinfectors. It was decided during the year to make them an allowance of 4s Od. in respect of each body. 24 The new building to be erected in place of Queen Mary's Hospital will incorporate a mortuary and it was decided, in principle, that the work carried out at Beaverwood Road would be transferred there in due course. During the year, 182 bodies were dealt with as compared with 138 in 1959. 72 of these came from hospitals, and in 24 cases inquests were held. HOSPITAL SERVICES.

(The last mentioned was opened during the year). The Control of Infection Committee, on which I am represented, continued to function. Voluntary organisations including the British Red Cross Society, the Women's Voluntary Service and the Friends of the Sidcup Hospitals continue to work for all local hospitals. The last mentioned association has been particularly active in the six years since its formation. It has a membership 410 and provides a trolley telephone, visits to and concerts for, patients, transport for relatives, an out-patient's canteen and so on. Good progress is being made with the plans for the new 500 bedded hospital to replace the existing buildings at Queen Mary's Hospital. The Schedules of Accommodation have been agreed and work should commence shortly on the accommodation for resident staff and the boiler house, as the first stage for this new hospital. Grove Park Hospital. This hospital comes within the purview of the Lewisham Group Hospital Management Committee, and has only five blocks comprising 265 beds which come within the Urban District boundaries. 202 of these are used for tuberculous patients, whilst the other 63 are reserved for non-tuberculous thoracic cases. Venereal Diseases. Patients are referred to the various hospitals with specialist clinics for dealing with these diseases. None of these clinics is situate within the Urban District. COUNTY COUNCIL SERVICES. Ambulance Service. The district is served by the ambulance depot at Bromley, where at the present time, there are twenty-seven ambulances and twenty-two sitting case cars available. The majority of these vehicles are radio-controlled. There is also a sub-depot at Main Road, Sidcup. 26 Domestic Help Service. The District Organiser's Office is at 69, Sidcup Hill, Sidcup, and the following is a summary of the cases assisted during 1960:— Maternity (Expectant Mothers) 127 Tuberculosis 6 Aged 549 Others 204 886 Family Help Service. Twenty-nine cases were assisted during the year. Child Help Service. Eleven cases were assisted in 1960. Evening and Night Attendant Service. Thirty-seven cases received assistance under this scheme during 1960. Domiciliary Midwifery. Nine full-time midwives are engaged in the district. Patients may obtain their services on direct application, or through their own private doctor. Health Visiting. One part-time and 12 full-time Health Visitors and School Nurses, together with three Tuberculosis Health Visitors are employed in the Urban District. District Nursing Service. Thirteen District Nurses work in the area. This service is provided on medical certification only and is free. No night service is in operation. 27 Ante-Natal Clinics and Child Welfare Centres.

SERVICES RENDERED BY VOLUNTARY AGENCIES. British Red Cross Society. The local headquarters of the Society is located at Hornbrook House, High Street, Chislehurst. It was with regret that towards the end of the year, the death of Mrs. A. Harvey, Divisional Director for the past 12 years, was announced. The Divisional Secretary is Mrs. E. M. Watling. Several local detachments of the Society continue to operate within the district and training in first aid, nursing and mothercraft both for cadets (11-15 years) and seniors is undertaken. First aid posts are manned at garden parties, gymkanas, cinemas, sports meetings and wherever there is a demand. Escorts are provided for patients travelling to and from hospitals. The Good Samaritan Club for the disabled meets at the Headquarters on the first and fourth Monday afternoon in each month, and there are handicraft classes on Tuesday mornings at the same venue. Similar classes are arranged in St. Paul's Cray on Wednesday mornings and sewing classes at Queen Mary's hospital. Foot Clinics for Old Age Pensioners take place at Chislehurst on Thursday mornings and afternoons. Medical loan depots are operated from Hornbrook House and from 24 Chislehurst Road, Sidcup. The St. John Ambulance Brigade. The Divisional Superintendent, Mrs. O. Barton, informs me that the 97th Sidcup Nursing Division, functions in the Sidcup area. Miss H. R. Haley is secretary. 30 Qualified first aiders attend the local cinema, meetings and outings of the Old Age Pensioners' Association, and Rest-a-While Club. Assistance is provided at Queen Mary's Hospital and at the Cheshire Foundation Home at Bromley. A First Aid Road Hut is manned on the Sidcup By-Pass when necessary. Medical equipment is on loan, at a nominal charge and may be obtained on Tuesday evenings from the Lamorbey Drill Hall, or at other times, by telephoning FOOtscray 2106. Women's Voluntary Service. This report has been furnished by the Metropolitan Kent County Office. Darby and Joan Club. The membership at the "Home from Home" club has now almost doubled and is nearing the 100. They continue to meet once a week at the Holy Redeemer Church Hall, Days Lane. General Welfare Work. W.V.S. members continue to assist at the Blind Clubs in Chislehurst and Sidcup and also do a considerable amount of visiting of old people in their homes. The Cray Valley Hospital Trolley Shop and the assistance given in the OutPatient department at Queen Mary's Hospital still occupies a number of W.V.S. members. They also frequently undertake to escort people to hospital. Meals on Wheels. Once again we have to report that the Meals on Wheels service has failed to materialise. The main difficulty is the inability to find suitable premises in which to cook the meals. CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE. The following is a brief summary of the work carried out by the Committee:— About 800 members attend one or more of the 12 clubs for the elderly which are geographically well spread throughout the district. "Redlac," Station Road, Sidcup. The original nine tenants still live in their flatlet homes. Boarding-Out Scheme. This continues to expand and to become better known. A total of over 200 placings have now been made. The Committee is always pleased to hear of anyone willing to house an elderly person. Friendly Visiting. The panel of visitors has continued the good work of visiting lonely old people. SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 32 SECTION C. SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. AGRICULTURE (SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1956. This Act places on local authorities the duty of securing the provision and maintenance of sanitary accommodation for the use of employees on agricultural holdings, of which there are 27 in the district. To these, 29 visits were paid and sanitary accommodation found to be defective in one instance, was remedied. CESSPOOLS. The year 1960 has seen the greatest step so far recorded, towards the abolition of cesspool drainage in this district. In 1954, the Council decided that where possible cesspool drainage should cease. With this in view, new sewers were planned in areas where there were groups of cesspools and where it was reasonably practicable to connect to outfalls. At that time, properties not connected to main drainage totalled 473. Since then several extensions have been effected to the sewerage system, the largest being the scheme carried through in North Cray during 1960. This accounted for the great marjority of the 111 cesspools which were disconnected during the year. Against this figure, it must be recorded that three new cesspools were constructed in the same period. Two of them were to new buildings where access to a sewer was not possible and the other was part of an improvement to a piggery. There are now 281 premises not connected to sewers:— Premises. Cesspools. Lamorbey and Blackfen 4 4 Sidcup and Footscray 5 4 North Cray 123 80 St. Paul's Cray 72 44 Chislehurst and Mottingham 77 71 In a number of cases two or more properties drain into one cesspool. There are also a few with small private disposal plants or which use chemical closets. Further sewerage works are to be carried out in the Leesons Hill area in 1961 and a further substantial decrease in cesspool drainage is forecast. 33 The Council provides a cesspool emptying service at very reasonable rates, especially for dwelling houses. A new emptying machine came into use during the year. Although its capacity was a third as much again as that which it replaced, it was decided not to increase the amount charged per load. It is gratifying to note that the use made of this service is still substantial, in spite of the decrease in the number of cesspools, as may be seen from the table:— Quarters Whole Year Mar. June Sept. Dec. 1960 1959 Individual cesspools emptied 128 128 99 99 188 211 No. of "jobs" including repeats 219 233 216 223 891 949 No. of loads removed 546 561 486 598 2,193 2,408 This represents a record total of 1,549,200 gallons of sewage disposed of during the year, and it would appear that cesspools are being emptied more frequently. DISEASES OF ANIMALS (WASTE FOODS) ORDER, 1957. The work of licencing and controlling plants for boiling waste food was delegated by the Kent County Council, during 1959. It is principally designed to prevent disease in animals fed on swill. The importance of this Order was underlined in 1960 when the district remained free from infection during the epidemic of Foot and Mouth Disease, in spite of an outbreak close by. Plants at six premises are licensed and 20 visits were paid to ensure that operation was satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that new lengths of sewer have been completed, or adopted in private estate development as follow:— Foul Sewers of 6", 9" and 12" diameters, totalling 2,208 yds. Surface Water Sewers of 9" and 12" diameters, totalling 2,455 yds. In addition, the Council repaired existing sewers, as follow:— Surface Water Sewers 9" diameter 75 yds. Schemes have been prepared for Foul Sewers 15" diameter 584 yds. Surface Water Sewers 9", 12", 15" and 18" diameters, totalling 238 yds. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948. Public Health Inspectors have made 284 visits of inspection to factories, with and without mechanical power, and building sites, etc. which are controlled by these Acts. 36 nuisances or defects were dealt with, some in conjunction with H.M. Inspector of Factories. 34 The following tables give details of factories and the work carried out thereat:— 1. Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health.

During the year, three licences to deal in Game were issued to local firms. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. Nine visits were paid to various shops, etc., where oil, electric or gas heating apparatus is sold, to ensure that they complied with the requirements laid down. 35 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. Licences to sell pet animals were issued to proprietors of eight premises. Supervision of these shops entailed ten visits and it was found that the sale of pets was on a small scale. No contraventions were detected. PETROLEUM (REGULATION) ACTS, 1928 AND 1936. Mr. J. C. Kermode, Chief Public Health Inspector, is the Inspector appointed under the above Acts. Petroleum spirit and/or petroleum mixtures are stored at 63 premises, under licence. The total capacity is as follows:— Petroleum spirit in tanks 166,970 gallons. Petroleum mixture in tanks 8,990 gallons. Petroleum spirit in cans in approved stores 100 gallons. Petroleum mixture in cans in approved stores 2,203 gallons. 178,263 gallons. Carbide of calcium 100 lbs. A small quantity of petroleum is also kept without a licence, under the terms of the Petroleum Spirit (Motor Vehicles, etc.) Regulations, 1929. The total quantity of spirit and mixtures continues to increase. More of the latter is being used in commercial processes, whilst garage proprietors, when renewing underground storage tanks frequently replace old 500 gallon installations with tanks of 2,000 or 3,000 gallons capacity—an obvious necessity in modern times. All new equipment is tested whilst being installed. PUBLIC CLEANSING. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. I am indebted to the Cleansing, Salvage and Transport Officer for the following information. The volume of refuse is still increasing and this is in line with the general trend throughout the country, due in a large measure to the increased use of electricity and oil for heating. This trend demands changes in our transport requirements which means vehicles of larger capacity, with a high degree of packing in order to maintain schedules. Compression of refuse within the vehicle is now an important factor to avoid the uneconomic use of transport. The number of premises cleared was in the region of 29,000 and as some of these buildings, particularly the large ones, use more than one bin, the number of journeys made by the collectors is substantial. It is estimated that 1,560,000 calls were made last year. In addition to dealing with special accumulations from trade premises, arrangements are in force for this service to be provided to individual householders. A charge is made, based on the actual cost of the job plus the usual oncosts. 36 Whilst the volume of work involved is not great it does provide a useful outlet to people who have extra debris or refuse for disposal, and is appreciated. All night burning stoves are obviously used to a large extent and these bring added dangers from fire, owing to hot ashes being placed in the bin. The volume of refuse collected was in the region of 155,000 cubic yards. A further 13,500 cubic yards was received at the tip in the form of trade refuse, gully contents, street sweepings, trimmings from verges, etc. Kitchen waste amounted to 300 tons, and was cleared chiefly from individual containers in Mottingham and Lamorbey areas and a number of schools. About 3,000 containers are in use. Disposal of the refuse was carried out at St. Paul's Cray Hill Park, where low lying ground is being reclaimed. Further vehicles and trailers of improved design, fitted with diesel engines have been purchased. Salvage, including waste paper, has been maintained at a high level in spite of market difficulties. The demand for newspaper has improved; cardboard and mixed papers are in keen demand and so are textiles. Trade Refuse. As there appears to be some misunderstanding regarding the clearance of this material, it is perhaps desirable to make the position clear. The removal of Trade Refuse can only be undertaken by the department, providing payment is made in accordance with the scale of charges laid down by the Council in order to comply with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936. Charges for Removal of Trade Refuse:— Small quantities—6d. per bin or sleep. Large quantities—Charge based on cost involved. Bulk container—£16 per annum for one collection per week. The frequency of collection can be increased provided the extra cost is met by the trader concerned. Bulk containers used in flats and other premises for storage of domestic refuse are emptied free of charge. The Bulk container system has many advantages where the volume of refuse to be dealt with, is equal to 8 to 14 normal size bins. Storage is improved by this method and the containers are emptied hydraulically and without dissemination of dust. 37 Bulk Container System. The Bulk container system was introduced to deal with refuse from flats, hospitals, hotels and other similar places in the district. Some of the main advantages are as follow:— 1. Improved storage. 2. The containers are emptied hydraulically, and the operation is dustless. 3. The containers cannot be interfered with by dogs or cats. 4. Where the volume of refuse is substantial it does away with the need for a large number of bins, which can look untidy and, take up a lot of room. Description of Containers. Containers of up to cubic yards capacity are emptied on site into an SD Refuse Collection vehicle by an extremely simple method which does not involve any additional hydraulic gear or controls. Containers arc removed from chambers or other loading positions (where they stand on side sills) by a simple form of Jack Truck, by which they are lifted about 2" and transported to the rear of the vehicle adjacent to the lifting hooks. The safety catches are lifted and the container pushed against the lifting cradle when the catches are dropped over the container handle, after which no further action by the operator is necessary. The containers are lifted automatically from the truck by the forward tipping action of the body of the vehicle, and as the body lifts the container is tipped through a dustless sealed aperture in the rear door of the body. The refuse from each container has the full available depth of the body into which it can fall, this provides a substantial degree of consolidation of refuse in the vehicle. When the body is again lowered, the container returns to the waiting Jack Truck and is automatically disconnected from the vehicle and can be immediately returned to the loading site. The total time for discharging each container into the vehicle is less than one minute from the arrival of the container on the truck to departure for repositioning on the loading site. Bulk Loading Vehicle. This consists of a modified SD Fore and Aft Tipping Refuse Collector of 16/18 cubic yards capacity, which is fitted with a special rear door carrying the necessary hooks for container attachment and automatic safety locking gear. The upper part of the door carries an aperture through which the mouth of the container enters as the body lifts, this being dust proofed by the use of simple double doors and a ring of rubber flaps. This arrangement forms a fully effective dust screen and seals the entry of the container before refuse commences to fall. 38 The upper portion of the door is hinged and spring loaded, which can be lifted without effort and locked in an open position to present a standard loading rave and a fall opening for use when discharging ordinary household bins at normal team loading rate from ground level. Discharge of the load is by rear tipping, the rear door opening automatically as in the standard Fore and Aft Tipping vehicle. Containers. The containers are of 1¼ cubic yards capacity of 16 s.w.g. steel construction stiffened with angle and flat section bands, and carry the lifting bar for attachment to the vehicle. The whole being galvanised after welding. Dimensions, 4' 3" high X 3' diameter. Circular type, or alternatively with flat sides 2' 6" wide to suit narrow dust chambers, and are adapted to stand on concrete sills 24½ to 25" apart X 8½" to 9" high. Prevention of Noise. A new type of bin is now on the market fitted with rubber lid and rubber base. This is an attempt to reduce noise and it is hoped these will find favour with the public. Plastic bins are also coming to the fore, unfortunately they are easily damaged, particularly by hot ashes. Labour. The shortage of labour and the continual movement of personnel has made it extremely difficult to maintain a weekly service; a heavy sickness roll has added to the difficulties of the department. In the past few years students have filled the gaps at certain periods, but this source did not produce the desired result this Christmas owing to more attractive employment being offered elsewhere. Paper Bag System. This system which has many advantages over the metal sanitary bin system, Is receiving substantial and continual publicity in the press, and whilst every one is interested in the hygienic storage and collection of refuse, it might be as well to mention one big factor to be taken into consideration and that is the extra cost the system would entail. The bags purchased in bulk cost between sixpence and sevenpence each, and this must be added to the present cost of the service. There would, however, be some saving in other directions, but as yet there is no evidence to show its introduction would not entail an additional charge on the rates. 39 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. There are no premises in the district licensed under the Rag Flock Act. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1939. There are now four stables from which horses are hired, for the purpose of riding. Animals, consisting of 33 horses and 56 ponies, were inspected by the Veterinary Surgeon appointed for the purpose. Four visits were made and the animals were reported to be in good health. The Inspectors paid a further 55 visits. It has not been necessary to require any substantial improvements to stables. RIVERS AND STREAMS. I am informed by the Engineer and Surveyor that apart from the normal maintenance of streams and rivers for which he is responsible, only the normal patrolling has been found necessary. The Inspectorial staff also keep observation of rivers and streams principally to detect pollution, and 94 visits were made for this purpose. A watch is also kept for rodent infestation in the banks where rubbish is liable to accumulate and any affected lengths are treated. Rainfall and Flooding. The year under review started well, with rainful below average. In the March-April period there were three weeks without rain and another four weeks with but a trace. This deficiency in rainfall continued into May and June. In fact only 9.13 inches were recorded as falling in the first half of the year. Thereafter, there was no week without rain and in the following six months, 23.73 inches fell, giving a total of 32.82 inches for the year, a figure well above average, and over 12 inches in excess of the fall for 1959. Details of rainfall are as follow:— January 1.78 ins. July 3.58 ins. February 1.53 ins. August 3.33 ins. March 2.22 ins. September 4.26 ins. April 0.46 ins. October 5.62 ins. May 1.92 ins. November 4.51 ins. June 1.23 ins. December 2.43 ins. On five days in 1960, about an inch of rain fell:— March 20th 0.89 ins. September 17th 1.00 ins. July 9th 0.90 ins. October 26th/27th 1.01 ins. August 12th .... 0.91 ins. Flooding was not serious, although surcharging did occur at one period in the lower reaches of Willersley Avenue. More severe 40 flooding of highways also took place at two points in the Chislehurst area where the gardens of three properties were affected. In 1958, when serious surcharging of sewers took place in the Sidcup area, 37.38 inches fell, a figure 4.152 inches in excess of the current year. RODENT CONTROL. It is difficult to account for the ebb and flow of rodent infestation. 1960 saw a modest increase in infestation both in the sewers and above ground, although the position is infinitely better than it was a few years ago. It would appear that increases in these pests may be part of a natural cycle and that dry weather, especially in the Spring is favourable to them. The total number of infested properties dealt with in 1960 amounted to 468, compared with 426 in the previous year. This tendency to increase has also been noted in the early part of 1961. Almost all of these infestations were of a minor character. A detailed summary of the work is set out herewith:— TYPE OF PROPERTY NON AGRICULTURAL (1) Local Authority (2) Dwellings (including Council Houses) (3) Others (incl.

No. of "Block" control schemes carried out — 6 2 8 — 41 SEWER INFESTATION An important part of the work of controlling rats, lies in the treatment of the Council's sewers. Here rats find plenty of food and shelter and a convenient system of communication. The whole of the sewerage system is "test baited" in the spring and on the information revealed, is based the sections to be dealt with during the twice yearly treatments subsequently carried out. The poison Warfarin is used in eradiction and it has proved much more efficacious in the sewers than zinc phosphide and other poisons previously used. Here it has the added advantage of low toxicity. Particulars of sewer treatments are given below. The figures reflect the same modest increase as was noted with surface infestation:— Number of Manholes treated No. of manholes in which "Complete takes" "Partial takes" "No takes" Test bait 202 14 7 181 1st Maintenance treatment (April) 69 15 19 35 2nd Maintenance treatment (Oct.) 69 2 4 63 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.

They are situated as follow:— Lamorbey and Blackfen 262 Sidcup and Footscray 280 North Cray and St. Paul's Cray 114 Chislehurst and Mottingham 201 857 The erection of a few new premises was largely counter-balanced by closing of older shops, at least pending reconstruction. Under present conditions, there is comparatively little incentive for shops to remain open later in the evening or on the half day closing, or on Sundays, when not permitted by the Shops Act. In the case of a few contraventions warnings have been issued. There are no Closing Orders (in respect of the early closing day) operative in the district. A tendency has been noticed for a few shops to close on an afternoon other than that usual in the particular vicinity. This does not constitute an offence, although there are conditions attached to the practice. Generally, closing days are as follow:— Wednesday—St. Paul's Cray Estate (except Leith Hill), Chislehurst, The Oval, Lamorbey. Thursday—Sidcup area (other than above) North Cray, Mottingham. Visits and observations in connection with the Shops Act totalled 403, and the following infringements have been dealt with. Offences Found. Remedied.

Recording of Atmospheric Pollution. Five instruments for the measurement of atmospheric pollution are installed within the district. There are two deposit gauges, two sulphur dioxide candles and a volumetric apparatus for measuring sulphur dioxide and tarry matter. Volumetric Apparatus. This instrument functions in the Public Health Department's office. A sample of the atmosphere is constantly being drawn through and readings are taken daily, throughout the year. It serves two functions. Firstly, to record the amount of the gas, sulphur dioxide present. This represents the irritant factor in pollution which, incidentally, will not be directly improved by the programme of Smoke Control Areas. Secondly, this daily recording gives an indication of the density of the suspended tarry matter in the air. It is at this substance, which mainly originates from domestic chimneys, that the smoke control programme is aimed. Both the sulphur dioxide and the tarry matter are virtually negligible in summer, but increase many times when foggy conditions obtain. Records show that pollution in 1960 did not reach a high level. The latter part of the winter was characterised by a few fairly high readings, whereas the autumn was relatively free from fog. Sulphur Dioxide Candles. The two candles are set at the Foootscray County Primary School, Sidcup (Riverside Road), and at the County Primary Roman Catholic School, Sidcup (Lamorbey). They again indicate the quantity of sulphur dioxide pollution, but are read monthly. Deposit Gauges. The two deposit gauges are situated alongside the sulphur dioxide candles and also give monthly readings. They are designed to measure the content of the solid matter in aerial pollution and are of importance in indicating the quantity of calcareous material, most of which has its origin in the cement flue dust emanating from cement works at Dartford and other places in the Thames Estuary. The problem of cement flue dust deposits in the area and in fact, in the whole of North West Kent, is one which has concerned the Council for many years. The Council is represented on the 44 Thames-side Joint Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution, which body meets regularly to review the position. Mr. A. V. Hatley has been active on this Committee as was Mrs. E. V. Wallace in the early part of 1960, and Mr. F. Ambrose in the latter. The aid of local members of Parliament has been enlisted with a view to making further representations to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, on the necessity for holding a Public Enquiry into the matter. The deposit gauges indicate that total solids at Riverside Road averaged 14.583 tons per square mile per month (13.97 in 1959) whilst at Lamorbey the monthly figure for 1960 was 13.135 tons, compared with 13.015 tons in 1959. The graphs given with the report, show the position more clearly, but it should be pointed out that the high reading at Riverside Road for August is very probably due to some extraneous cause and should be disregarded. The Council were also represented on the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies in the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution by Mr. Hatley and Mr. Ambrose, on the National Society for Clean Air and South East Divisional Council by Miss B. H. James, and on the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council by Mr. Hatley and the Chief Public Health Inspector. Smoke Control Areas. The Clean Air Joint Committee met during the year and after considering a report on a preliminary survey carried out in the district, recommended to the Council that a Smoke Control Area should be constituted in the Mottingham South Ward, together with houses in Oakdene Avenue, Chislehurst. This is an undertaking of some magnitude, comprising 2,364 houses and 48 miscellaneous premises. At that time it was necessary to apply for approval in principle from the Minister. This procedure has now been abandoned and the detailed survey will proceed with a view to obtaining a Smoke Control Order to become operative on the 6th September, 1962. Furnace Installation. Other duties placed upon the Department by the Clean Air Act include the perusal of plans of new factory premises where the height of flue has to be approved in order to obviate nuisance from smoke and grit. Two such plans were dealt with during 1960. It is also necessary for persons proposing to instal heating appliances above a certain capacity, to give notice of intention, and three notifications were received in this connection. 45 Footscray County Primary School, Footscray.

There are three swimming pools in the area, although as far as is known, one of them did not open in 1960. Eighteen visits of inspection were made to these pools. Of the two functioning, one is in the open air within the grounds of a factory, and is not available generally to the public. Water is filtered, aerated and chlorinated, and two samples taken during the year showed the water to be satisfactory. The other pool which is covered and heated, is attached to a Children's Home and used also by school children. A modern purification plant is installed and ten samples taken by the owner all showed the water to be kept in good condition. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS AND INSECT PESTS. Sixteen complaints were received concerning vermin infestation as a result of which 19 visits were paid to investigate and where necessary, to arrange treatment. In all, seven Council properties were disinfected together with six prefabricated bungalows. These treatments were mainly of a precautionary nature and were carried out after the premises had been vacated by unsatisfactory tenants. In addition, eight privately owned properties were sprayed. The Council does not undertake the destruction of wasps, but the Department is usually able to refer ratepayers who may have nests on their property to an experienced person, who will undertake the work. Ninety-seven instances of wasp infestation came to notice during the year, a substantial decrease on the previous year. WATER SUPPLY. All dwelling houses in the district receive a piped supply from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. I am informed by the Director of Water Examination to the Board, that there has been no major change in these sources of supply to the area of Sidcup. They are well water from Bexley, Darenth, Eynsford, Horton Kirby, North Orpington, Orpington. Shortlands and Wilmington, together with River Thames derived filtered water. A summary of the results of bacteriological and chemical examination of these sources is set out in the following pages. None of the supplies is plumbo-solvent. The supply has been adequate during the year 1960 and there have been no extensions of trunk or service mains. The quality of the water has remained excellent and there have been no special cases of contamination. 54 No instance of shortage of water in the district came to the notice of the Department during the year. Three privately owned wells are in use mainly supplying water for commercial purposes. Six samples from these were examined for chemical content. Nine well water samples were submitted for bacteriological examination, one of which revealed the presence of coliform organisms in small numbers. Three further specimens from the same source were satisfactory. Following a complaint, the Department also took one sample from a house supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. It proved satisfactory, both bacteriologically and chemically. 55 Average Results of the Bacteriological Examination of the water supplied to the Urban District of Chisieharst and Sidcnp during 1960 Bexley Well Darenth Well Eynsford No. 1 Eynsford No. 2 Horton Kirby No. 1 Horton Kirby No. 2 Source ot Supply Shortlands No. 1 Shortlands No. 2 Shortlands No. 3 Wilmington No. 2 Thames derived Orpington North Orpington Number of Samples 245 174 197 140 216 150 247 226 74 201 226 249 - Agar plate count per ml. 20-24 hours at 37°C. 0.1 0.1 - - 0.2 0.3 0.1 59.4 0.1 - 1.0 0.1 - 3 days at 22°C. 101 4 74 3 105 14 38 437 1 1 25 45 - Coliform count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml 100 86.21 71.07 98.57 92.13 98.67 88.26 7.96 100 99.50 99.12 94.38 - Count per 100 ml - 0.4 1.2 - 0.7 - 0.2 134.4 - 0.1 - 0.1 - Escherichia coli count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml 100 93.10 96.95 100 95.37 100 100 20.35 100 100 100 99.20 - Count per 100 ml - 0.2 0.1 - 0.4 - - 50.3 - - - - - Number of Samples 249 175 256 246 253 229 257 257 1,874 Agar plate count per ml. 20-24 hours at 37°C. 0.7 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 3.1 0.1 - 8.6 3 days at 22°C. 20 151 12 75 8 10 19 11 - Coliform count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml 99.20 100 99.61 99.59 99.60 99.13 100 99.61 99.57 E. coli count Percentage samples negative in 100 ml 100 100 100 100 100 99.56 100 100 100 Average Results of the Chemical Examination of the water supplied to the Urban District of Chislehurst and Sidcup during 1960 Milligrammes per litre (unless otherwise stated).

Two houses in the Clearance Area comprising 1-12 School Cottages, declared in 1958, have been vacated. Houses suitable for the elderly persons residing in most of these properties are being constructed, and it is hoped that they will be rehoused in 1961. A Clearance Order comprising Nos. 3-18 Garden Place, and 19-23 Garden Cottages, Footscray, was confirmed during the year. This area consisting of 21 old houses, most of them of wood frame construction, constitutes the most extensive slum clearance scheme undertaken in the district. They lie within the Footscray Redevelopment Area. They are adjacent to No. 5 Cray Road. Footscray, and three flats above Nos. 7 and 9 Cray Road, Footscray. The Demolition Order made on No. 5 Cray Road in 1959, was carried into effect during the year and the families occupying two of the flats at Nos. 7 and 9 Cray Road, on which Closing Order was made in 1959, were rehoused. The third occupant died before he could be accommodated. A survey was in progress in 1960 to ascertain whether any further houses in the district have deteriorated to such an extent that they fall within the Closing or Demolition sections of the Housing Act. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS During the year, 96 applications were received for Improvement Grants of which 82 were made. Details are as follow:— Discretionary Grants Standard Grants 1. Total applications received 60 36 2. Schemes approved 33 29 3. Amount involved in item 2 £7,936 Not yet known 4. Grants made 54 28 5.

Two applications were for provision of additional accommodation and one for the elimination of rising dampness. So far as Standard Grants were concerned, applications covered 17 bathrooms, 21 wash hand basins, 4 W.C.'s, 24 hot water supplies and 11 food stores. 60 RENT ACT, 1957.

Five families from the waiting list were housed in prefabricated bungalows during the year and six families were housed in Halfway House accommodation. The Council purchased The Turret, Rectory Lane, and this property has now had improvements carried out and is still being used to assist families served with Court Orders. During the period 1st February, 1960, to 25th July, 1960, families who received Court Orders were housed in permanent accommodation owing to the fact that there was no Halfway House available. 5. The total number of families on the waiting list as at the 31st December, 1960:— Couples 332 Families requiring two bedrooms 401 Families requiring three bedrooms 292 Families requiring four or more bedrooms 6 Old age pensioners and single persons 252 Applicants passed for accommodation 54 1,337 During the year two single unit properties and two Halfway Houses have been released from requisition and 71 temporary bungalows on various Estates were demolished in connection with permanent development. A further house was converted into flats for elderly people, now making three properties of this type containing 28 flatlets. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Legislation dealing with the stationing of caravans and other moveable dwellings was previously governed by the Public Health and Town Planning Acts. Over the course of years, it had become obvious that the provisions contained in these Acts were quite inedaquate to deal either with holiday sites or those used by more itinerant users. Nowhere had this deficiency been more apparent than in Chislehurst and Sidcup. It was therefore with particular interest that the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, was received. With certain exceptions, the Act calls for application to be made by an owner for a Site Licence for any land, in use or intended to be used for stationing caravans. Although existing sites have certain rights, 62 conditions may be attached to Site Licences controlling numbers of dwellings, sanitary facilities, etc. The following sites were in use in the area at the time the new Act came into force. Site Average number of families Approx. number of inhabitants Licence under Public Health Act 1936 Applied for Site Licence under New Act Small gains Farm 2 4 Yes Yes Baugh Estate, Footscray 2 6 Yes No Ruxley Manor Farm 1 2 Yes No Lower Hockenden Farm 1 2 Yes Yes Twysdens Meadow 2 6 Yes Yes R/o Twysdens Meadow 1 5 Yes No Conservative Club, Sidcup 1 2 Yes Yes Chalk Pit, Ruxley 30 147 No Yes R/o White House, Church Road, Footcray 3 6 No No Sun Club, Hockenden 2 5 Yes Yes Greenwood, Birchwood Road 1 2 No No Perry Street, Chislehurst 4 4 Yes Not applicable It will be seen from the last column of the above table that the number of sites is likely to be reduced considerably. The Chalk Pit, Ruxley, was the subject of a number of meetings of a Special Committee, at which were considered various solutions to the serious public health nuisance arising there. Subsequent to the passing of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, the Pit was purchased by one of the caravan users. At that time there were 35 caravans present. The new owner proved co-operative and it was agreed to reduce the number of caravans to 25, as soon as possible. Permission envisages that the site will be extinguished at the end of seven years. A site licence was issued to him in the early part of 1961, but he had already commenced extensive works, with a view to providing roadways, hard standings, separate chemical closets, cesspool drainage and other amenities. Work was seriously delayed during the winter by exceptionally wet weather, but it is hoped that 1961 will see a vast improvement over the conditions which have previously obtained on this site. SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. 64 SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOODS. INSPECTIONS. Records show that there are now 520 buildings in the district where food is prepared or stored, or from which it is sold. These premises vary from large food factories and wholesale warehouses, to cafes, canteens and confectionery kiosks. Details of the number of trades concerned are given later in this section. Some of these premises, particularly those from which ice cream is sold or at which sausages are prepared are registered under the Food and Drugs Act, but in all cases they are subject to the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960. By and large all food premises in the district now comply with the structural requirements of the Regulations. By courtesy of the Engineer and Surveyor, plans of new food premises or alteration to existing premises are examined. It is thus possible to indicate to owners or architects any improvements or matters which will require attention before work commences. It is still of great importance to continue the strict supervision of food premises. In some cases it is found that equipment provided has become defective or is not being used. The frequent turnover of staff of food shops and canteens necessitates a constant programme of education if food is to be handled in an hygienic manner. For these purposes, 3,630 visits have been paid during the year. Although many matters are dealt with in an informal way, it was necessary to serve 78 notices and 266 items were remedied. FOOD COMPLAINTS. A considerable proportion of the Inspectors time is occupied in carrying out detailed enquiries into complaints made with regard to foreign matter or abnormalities in food. The modern trend towards mass production of food and the extensive use of pre-packing, although a marked step towards hygienic handling, seems to have given rise to new difficulties. Thirty-three investigations of this nature were carried out compared with 52 in the previous year. Not all of these complaints were found to be justified, but all were reported to the Committee, who decided on the action to be taken, judging each case on its own merit. 65 The complaints followed the usual pattern. Eight referred to foreign matter in milk or dirty milk bottles; 7 related to insects or other material baked into bread or flour confectionery, and no fewer than 10, to wrapped goods being sold in a mouldy condition. Of the last mentioned group, six were meat pies. So concerned were the Committee that in the early summer letters were addressed to all manufacturers of pies sold in the district, and to retailers, drawing their attention to the necessity for extreme care in dealing with these highly perishable commodities. It is found that most pies bear a code number, either stamped in the substance of the pastry or imprinted in the wrapper, by which the manufacturer is able to identify the time and date on which the article was produced. Manufacturers also issued instructions to retailers as to how the pies should be handled and giving information as to the maximum time they may be held in stock. Investigations show that this time limit is frequently exceeded. The code numbers are not legible to the purchaser nor to the shop keeper. The Committee has made representation through the Urban District Council's Association to the Government Departments concerned, with a view to making the use of a legible date stamp on pies, etc., obligatory. The Ministry has not seen fit to accede to the request. The following prosecutions were instituted:— Mouldy pork pie—fined £5, plus £10 10s. costs. Metal washer in bread—fined £20, plus £10 10s. costs. Mouldy steak and kidney pie—fined £25, plus £15 15s. costs. Mouldy meat pie—fined £30. plus £21 costs.

Bottled milk containing insects—fined £20, plus £7 15s. costs. Bottled milk containing old drinking straw—fined £20, plus £5 5s. costs. Mouldy pork sausage—fined £50, plus £4 4s. costs. Mouldy wrapped loaf—fined £10, plus £3 3s. costs. Mouldy pork pie—fined £20, plus £10 10s. costs. Maggot in bun—fined £3 3s., plus 10s. costs. Insect in fruit tart—absolute discharge on payment of £18 18s. costs. 66 FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955.

The following are details of licences to deal in specially designated milks, issued by the Council in respect of 1960 :— Dealers. Supplementary. Pasteurised 24 14 Sterilised 28 13 Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 18 13 During the year the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960, were made. This will have the effect of simplifying the procedure for licencing. The Supplementary Licence will be abolished and licences will in future be issued for periods of five years. No processing of milk takes place within the district. Sale takes place from automatic vending machines on the forecourts of three premises. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. Twenty-four samples of designated milk were taken with the following results :— Number passing phosphatase test 22 Number failing phosphatase test — Number passing methylene blue test 22 Number giving unsatisfactory methylene blue result — Number passing the turbidity test (sterilised) 2 Twenty-four samples of milk were submitted for chemical examination, all of which proved satisfactory. ICE CREAM. Ten samples were taken during the year. Six were placed in Grade I, one in Grade II and three in Grade III. No manufacture of ice cream takes place within the district. PIGGERIES. There are 14 piggeries in the district compared with 11 in the previous year. The number of pigs kept, has risen from 1,553 to 2,300. One large piggery houses 1,000 animals and two others 500 and 400 respectively. Thirty-five visits have been paid to these sties. SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 72 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. General. In the past few years the total number of notifications of infectious diseases received, have been dominated by the disease "measles". It will be seen that the wave of measles, occurring every other year gives rise to alternative high and low figures. 1960 26 1956 790 1959 1,391 1955 1,896 1958 387 1954 661 1957 1,955 It is interesting to note the "low" figures have been decreasing. In other respects also, 1960 can be considered a good year, as there were no cases of poliomyelitis, meningoccocal infection or typhoid fever notified. In fact, 60% of the notifications in 1960 were associated with an outbreak of a mild form of Whooping Cough, which brought in 84 and 80 notifications in June and July respectively. Once again, the vast majority of cases of infectious disease continued the mild trend so noticeable in recent years. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis and Vaccination. I am pleased to be able to report a complete absence of this disease in the Urban District during the year 1960. The County Medical Officer informs me that a total of 4,661 residents in Chislehurst and Sidcup received their second injection, and 7,147 their third against this disease during the year. Diphtheria and Diphtheria Immunisation. Again, it is pleasing to be able to report a complete absence of this disease in the Urban District in 1960. I understand from the County Medical Officer that a total of 18,720 children in the Urban District under the age of 15 years on 31st December, 1960, have, at some time before that date, completed a course of immunisation against this disease. Dysentery. Notifications of this disease were well up on the previous year, 45 cases being notified as against 12 in 1959. There did not appear to be any particular focus of infection, the incidence being spread over the period from January to August. The disease is usually amenable to modern treatment but prevention of spread is difficult on account of the prevalence of symptomless carriers. 73 In conjunction with the general practitioners concerned, the department arranged for the examination of specimens to ensure that patients, particularly school children and food handlers are free from infection after treatment. Food Poisoning. The figure of notified and confirmed cases at 7 (of which 2 were treated in hospital) is low compared with any recent year. 27 cases were notified in 1959. Seven other suspected cases were investigated but could not be confirmed. The following is a copy of the annual return rendered to the Ministry of Health:— 1.

Only 26 cases were notified as compared with 1,127 during 1959. None of these cases were admitted to hospital and no deaths were recorded. Meningococcal Infections. No cases were notified. Pneumonia. Fifteen cases were notified as against 42 during the previous year. There were 32 deaths attributed to pneumonia, but this figure includes people who are normally resident in the Urban District and who died outside the area. Scarlet Fever. Notifications of this disease showed a reduction in 1960, a total of 63 cases being notified as against 77 during 1959. Most of these were of a very mild nature and only five cases went to hospital. No deaths from this disease were recorded. Smallpox and Vaccination. A case of smallpox (not resident in this District) was imported into the the country during October. The person concerned travelled around London for a day or two before the disease was diagnosed. During that time there had been possible contact with three persons residing in this area. It was necessary to keep these contacts under surveillance for a time equivalent to the incubation period for the disease. I am pleased to record that no further cases developed. In connection with this occurrence, the entire staff of the Public Health Department were re-vaccinated. 455 International Certificates of vaccination were dealt with by the department during the course of the year. The County Medical Officer informs me that a total of 908 residents in the area received primary vaccination and 19 re-vaccination in 1960. Tuberculosis. The following table shows the position with regard to tuberculosis, with comparative figures for the past 10 years (as corrected by inward and outward transfers). There were four deaths from tuberculosis during the year. 76 TUBERCULOSIS 1960 Year Ended Population Notifications Numb er of CaseB on Register Pulm. Non-Pulm. Pulm. Non-Pulm.

I am indebted to the Liaison Officer of the above Committee for the following information:— "The work of the Committee has followed the usual patternassisting many families with fuel, hire purchase debts, fares to visit patients, clothing, footwear, etc., and for several families, holidays by the sea were provided. The closest liaison is maintained wjth all statutory bodies, and the W.V.S. are most helpful in every way. The Office at the United Services Club, 108, Main Road, Sidcup, continues to open every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and regular home visits are also paid to many patients." Typhoid and Para-Typhoid Fever. No cases were notified during the year. Whooping Cough. Notifications of this disease rose considerably in 1960, a total of 231 cases coming to our knowledge, compared with 88 during 1959. Generally speaking the disease was mild in character and no deaths were recorded. I understand from the County Medical Officer that a total of 1,373 children resident in the Urban District were immunised against this disease during the year under review. Other Infectious Diseases. In addition, notifications were received as under:— Puerperal Pyrexia 2 cases Erysipelas 2 cases APPENDIX. STATISTICAL TABLES. 80 STATISTICAL TABLES, 1960. TABLE I.—Summary of Statistics.
