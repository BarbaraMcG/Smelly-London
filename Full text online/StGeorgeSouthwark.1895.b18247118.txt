The foregoing return shows that the total actual attendances at the Vestry and Committee Meetings combined for the twelve months ended on March 25th, 1896, have been 2,254, out of a possible 3,777, which gives a percentage of 59.6. The actual attendances at Vestry Meetings alone have been 955, out of a possible 1,367, a percentage of 69.8. Of the various Standing Committees the Works shows the highest actual attendance, viz., 318, as also the highest percentage, viz. 56.8. The actual attendances of the Public Health and Sewers' Committee amount to 236, which yields a percentage of 43.7. The Finance comes next with an actual attendance of 220, and a percentage of 5T2 ; while the General Purposes Committee shows an actual attendance of 190, and a percentage of 44.3. Special Committees grouped together show an actual attendance of 254, with a percentage of 72.5, and Sub-Committees an actual attendance of 81, and a percentage of 64.2. 9 VESTRY OF ST. GEORGE THE MARTYR, SOUTHWARK. ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 25TH, 1896. The Vestry herewith present for the information of the Parishioners the Annual Report for the year 1895-1896, together with the Abstract of Accounts. I11 addition to the Audit of the elected Auditors, the Accounts, for the first time in the history of the Yestry, have been audited by Chartered Accountants, on this occasion—Messrs. Hart Brothers, Tibbetts & Company. No change has taken place in the organisation of the Standing Committees ; and, following the practice of previous years, it will be convenient to deal with the work of the Vestry under these Committees. WORKS COMMITTEE. The work of this Committee was, to some extent, covered in the Surveyor's Report, published in the autumn of 1895. That officer carried his report practically to the date of his retirement, namely September in that year. After many years of service he was awarded a retiring pension; and he carried with him the good wishes of his many friends. Out of a large number of applicants Mr. Oliver E. Winter, C.E., was appointed to fill the post thus vacated. He came with high credentials from the Corporation of Norwich, where he had been Assistant Surveyor. Granite-cube Carriageways.—Marshall Street and Great Suffolk Street are the principal roads which have been repaired during the last year. The actual exceeded the estimated cost, but this excess 10 was largely due to the fact that the work was undertaken with the object of providing work for the unemployed. Unhappily the men themselves did not realise that a Parish such as this cannot afford to pay the trade-union rate of wages for loafer's work. But, on the other hand, it must be remembered that the season of the year when the work was begun, was such that ordinary energy could scarcely be expected. There was a distinct loss on the job, but the lesson learned was salutary. The direct employment of labour, as a policy, can only succeed when wage-earners themselves, no less than their leaders, learn that an honest wage demands and expects honest work. Block Carriageways.—The repaving of the Old Kent Road with wood has been finished in the course of the year. The estimated cost was not exceeded, and although part of the pavement was laid at the beginning of the frost of February and March, 1895, little, if any, serious damage has resulted. On the whole, therefore, the Parish has reason to be satisfied with the result. It should not, however, be forgotten that the cost has to be repaid in seven years, and that for the next six years this repayment involves a l½d. rate. Those who criticise the expenditure of the Yestry should not forget the expense that this undoubted improvement has involved. It is obvious that if money is spent one way it cannot be spent another, and the importance of the Old Kent Road as a thoroughfare, as well as the convenience of the inhabitants, justified the expenditure. The wood paving in the Borough High Street has been relaid during the year, in accordance with the Vestry's contract with the Improved Wood Pavement Company. The Parishioners should remember, when considering the cost of the Old Kent Road, the cost of this analagous piece of work. The Parish pays £454 18s. 8d. per annum for twenty years ; and the Company are obliged to repave once in five years. On the Old Kent Road, Jarrahdale Jarrah blocks have been used, in the Borough High Street assorted pitch pine. The life of Jarrahdale Jarrah blocks has yet to be proved ; but judging from the experience gained in the London Road and in the St. George's Circus, where this wood is used, the London County Council in that they only allowed the Parish to borrow for seven years, have certainly safeguarded the interests of the ratepayers. 11 Sundry small repairs have been carried forward throughout the year. There is no need to enumerate them in detail. It should not, however, be forgotten that a considerable sum has been laid out for plant. This expenditure has been necessary, because the Yestry has decided to do its work by direct employment. The Yestry might have been well-advised, when they first embarked on this policy, if they had purchased the necessary plant out of a loan specially made. Instead of this, all plant has been bought out of revenue. No doubt this course has been for the permanent benefit of the ratepayers, but the fact should be borne in mind when the amount of rates is considered. As regards the Wheelwright's and Smith's Department, the Yestry have to record with regret that their wheelwright Mr. Pallett, has left their service to take up duties at a considerably increased salary. The whole of the Department is receiving considerable attention at the hands of the Works Committee. In his last report the late Surveyor testified that the Wheelwright and Smith's Department had been an unqualified success. The lighting of the Parish has received considerable attention at the hands of this Committee. It is generally felt that, seeing the amount of the gas bill, the Parish should get a better light. It will probably be necessary to re-arrange the position of many lamps, and perhaps to provide improved burners. The poorer the district the better should it be lighted, and although, speaking generally, the proportionate number of lamps compare favourably with that of other districts, their lighting capacity is not satisfactory. As usual, the unfortunate shape of the Parish increases the difficulty. A Special Committee has been considering the question for some time past. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SEWERS COMMITTEE. The work of the Sanitary Department is dealt with in some detail in the Medical Officer's Report. There are, however, certain points to which the Vestry would direct especial attention. (i.) The rate of mortality of infants and children continues excessive. Of every 1,000 births in this Parish 208 die within the first year of life; the average rate for London, as a whole, during the past five years is 155 per 1,000. Dr. Waldo indicates six causes 12 which lead to this disastrous result. It is not, however, within the Vestry's province to propose remedies, inasmuch as several of those suggested are not within their control. His opinion, however, should be considered carefully by the inhabitants generally, and especially by those who have influence with the poorest classes; for, as always, they are the chief sufferers. In reference to this excessive death rate, the Medical Officer has on more than one occasion called the attention of the vestry to the desirability of making measles a notifiable disease. On his suggestion steps were taken to consult the other Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis, and to learn their views. The replies received were not such as to encourage the hope of action, in the near future, to secure any alteration in the law ; but the matter is still under consideration. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the death rate tends to decrease; and small though it be, 0.2 per 1,000, still it does decrease. In the years 1841-1850, the average death rate was 30 per 1,000, in 1895 it was 23.7. (ii.) Public attention has been directed to the action of the Medical Officer of Health, and of this Vestry, in relation to the Shelter in Blackfriars Road; the decision of the magistrate practically convicted the Salvation Army Authorities of serious overcrowding. It should not be forgotten that desirable as these proceedings may have been, the Vestry of one of the poorest parishes was fighting the battle of the whole metropolis ; for, although other public authorities may have applauded the Vestry's action, they did not contribute towards the cost, and it cannot be denied that unlicensed shelters are shown to be a source of danger to the health of the metropolis. (iii.) The housing of the working classes remains a question of perennial difficulty, and indeed the sanitary work of the Vestry is considerably hampered by the lack of proper housing accommodation. A large number of houses have been closed on sanitary grounds ; and and the loss of revenue in rates, as stated in the last Annual Report, amounts to nearly £4,000 a year; and, further, the Medical Officer does not conceal the fact that at least 500 more houses should be dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts ; but, having regard to the increased overcrowding which would then 13 result, and to the increased burden of rates, he is obliged to proceed cautiously and slowly, until some effective steps are taken to build over the cleared areas and to rebuild closed houses. Indeed, there is no doubt, that this is the most serious question which confronts the Vestry at the present time; for their most important work is their sanitary work. In these circumstances it is satisfactory to know that the London County Council are considering the desirability of erecting dwellings for the working classes on these vacant sites. There is, we believe, no district in London where improved dwellings are more urgently required.* The Vestry approached the Bridge House Commissioners, both by letter and deputation, with the request that, inasmuch as they were the chief ground landlords of the Parish, they would erect dwellings similar to those erected by the Commissioners of Sewers in Petticoat Square. The Vestry, however, were informed that the Commissioners were unable to entertain the suggestion. On the whole, the work of the Sanitary Department may be regarded as satisfactory; that some results are achieved is shown by the diminished death rate. GENERAL PURPOSES, TREES AND OPEN SPACES COMMITTEE. The sphere of work covered by the General Purposes Committee is, to a certain extent, connoted by its title, but in addition it is intended to act as a Cabinet of the Vestry. For this reason a large number of important subjects have passed through its hands. Early in the year the Vestry applied to the Local Government Board, asking that the appointment of Overseers might be transferred to the Vestry. Under the present system the Vestry submit names, and the magistrates select those who, in their opinion, are the best qualified for the office. As a matter of fact, the first names are usually chosen. The Vestry, however, have long been anxious that the work of the Overseers should, to some extent, be brought under the Vestry, in so far as existing statutory powers permit ; and, although the Vestry has no desire to review the work * Since the date of this Report, the Vestry are happy to report that the L.C.C. have begun to build on the Gun Street and Green Street areas. Other sites are still before them. 14 of the Overseers, it is important that the Parish, as a whole, should be in touch with their general proceedings. Their accounts (so far as the Poor rate is concerned) are subject to an audit by the Local Government Board, and their accounts (so far as the General Rate is concerned) are audited by the Vestry's Auditors, and delivered to the Vestry annually; but further than this on one has any control or official knowledge of their proceedings. The Local Government Board instructed the Vestry to apply for an Order so that the powers of the Overseers might be transferred to the Vestry. This matter is still under consideration. Early in the year the Vestry had before them the distress occasioned by the memorable winter of 1894-95. To provide work for the unemployed is beyond the scope of the Vestry; and it seemed of the first importance that there should be the closest co-operation between the Vestry and the Guardians. A recommendation was received from the St. Saviour's Guardians to the effect that it would be desirable that the Vestry should provide work for carefully-selected men who were out of employment through no fault of their own ; and this recommendation received the support of the Vestry. It should not, however, be forgotten that the employment of a large number of casual labourers on a quasi-charitable basis tends to demoralise the permanent staff. The present Vestry is irrevocably committed to the direct employment of labour. The system cannot work satisfactorily unless pains are taken so to arrange the work of the Parish that continuous employment may be provided for serviceable men. The Parish pays a full rate of wage ; they have a right to demand full value for their money. And although, happily, through the mildness of the past winter, there was no serious pressure of exceptional distress, it must not be forgotten that in a Parish such as this there are always a large number of men out of work. It would appear that if any permanent help is to be given to this unfortunate and pitiable class, the matter must be taken in hand by the Local Government Board, acting on carefully-considered lines. It is futile, as well as costly, to expect a purely administrative body such as the Vestry to attempt to deal with a question which presents greater difficulties than any other social question now before the Legislature. A Vestry has neither the staff nor the experience to enable them to grapple with so complicated a subject. 15 The Committee has considered the provision of a Reception House, where families from one, two, or three-roomed tenements may temporarily be housed while their rooms are being disinfected. A piece of land has been acquired abutting on the Stone Yard in King James Street, and plans have been passed for the erection of a suitable building. Some delay has been occasioned by the change of Surveyors, but tenders for the erection will shortly be issued. The condition of the trees in the Parish has frequently received attention. They do not flourish for a variety of reasons. In one instance it was discovered that owing to a serious leak in the gas mains some well established trees were poisoned. This is but an illustration of the risks to which these trees are exposed, and it is remarkable that they should have done as well as they have. At the same time, the Yestry would take this opportunity of appealing to the Parishioners to spare no pains to protect their own property. There is no doubt that if the trees had a fair chance, in five-andtwenty years' time they would improve considerably the appearance of the Parish, and might improve somewhat its sanitary condition. As regards the open spaces of the Parish, they continue to be used by large numbers of people, but their total area amounts to less than half-an-acre for 60,000 people. The Churchyard, however, presents many difficulties to this Committee ; and, popular as this small ground is, want of air, light, and good soil prevent the growth of flowers. But a proposal is now before the London County Council which may tend considerably to the improvement of this ground. The sanitary condition of Wilmot's Buildings and Bangor Court has been brought under the notice of the Yestry by the Medical Officer, and a considerable number of houses in the former have been closed. There has been also, for many years, a generally expressed desire that the Borough, as a thoroughfare, should be improved. Traffic not unfrequently becomes congested opposite St. George's Church, and there is reason to expect that when the new approaches to the Tower Bridge are complete, and when the Tower Bridge becomes more generally used, the traffic in Long Lane will further increase. The condition of Tabard Street—the Kent Street of old days—has also received frequently the consideration of the Yestry. A scheme, therefore, has been laid before the 'County 16 Council whereby these three improvements might be simultaneously provided. If the sites of Bangor Court and Wilmot's Buildings were added to the Churchyard, there is reason to believe that the Ecclesiastical Authorities would not object to Tabard Street being continued through the Churchyard—thus restoring the original line of the old Roman Road. If Long Lane were to be widened by taking certain houses on the south and north side, direct communication between the Metropolitan improvements effected by the making of Marshalsea Road and the reconstruction of Star Corner would be securedThese proposals are before the County Council, and it is eminently to be desired that this improvement may be regarded as Metropolitan in character. The cost, of course, is far too large for any single parish to take in hand, nor has this Vestry the necessary staff. At the same time, the necessity for the improvement is due to causes over which the Parish has little or no control. The Bermondsey Vestry have urged the Vestry of St. George the Martyr to reconsider the grant which was promised in 1893, towards the purchase for an open space of the Guy's Burying Ground in Nelson Place. The Vestry then decided that, subject to the statutory powers being obtained, a grant of £164 should be made towards the cost; but it was afterwards found that the price of the ground will be considerably more than was originally supposed. This Vestry was, therefore, asked to increase its contribution to £210. To their regret this request had to be refused, on the ground that the contribution already promised seemed adequate, having regard to the fact that a comparatively small number of the children of the Parish would make use of this ground; and secondly, because other open spaces are required in the Parish itself. An effort is being made, and at the date of this Report no decision has been arrived at, to open West Square as a playground for children. At present the ground is in a somewhat dilapidated condition, owing to the fact that the inhabitants of the Square are not disposed to provide sufficient funds for its proper maintenance. The ground landlord, Colonel Temple-West, has been communicated with, and there is reason to hope that, subject to the approval of the inhabitants of the Square, it may be possible to secure this as an open space for that district. The 17 character of the whole neighbourhood has changed considerably in the course of the last fifteen years, and there is no doubt but that an open space is required. It would be premature to speculate as to the possible results. Another subject of considerable importance has been under the consideration of the Vestry. The Governors of the St. Saviour's Grammar School have long considered the desirability of moving their schools to the suburbs, because, owing to the competition of St. Olave's Grammar School, they find considerable difficulty in filling the school. The Governors ultimately decided that the school should be removed to the Clapham Road, thus taking it altogether from the district which its founder originally intended to benefit; and, although the Vestry have on direct or indirect control in the management of the school, they felt constrained in the interests of the Parish, to pass a resolution urging the Governors to re-establish their school in the neighbourhoood of Southwark. They accordingly joined with the St. Saviour's Board of Guardians in passing a resolution praying the Governors to reconsider their decision, and urging the Charity Commissioners to withhold their consent from the proposed change. The water famine of February and March, 1895, will not soon be forgotten, and the whole question of the water supply of London has been before the public. By the Vestry's instruction, evidence was submitted before the Local Government Board Inspector, who held an inquiry as to the failure of supply in this Parish. The late Surveyor, Mr. Hiscocks, and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Edwards, prepared information, and a careful inquiry was made in the Parish as to the failure of supply. It was stated that this failure was due largely to the fact that the water mains in certain parts of the Parish were only eighteen inches below the surface of the road; and although this level may have been to a certain extent unusual, there is no doubt that the mains froze sooner than would have been the case had they been laid at a proper level. The Medical Officer of Health has on several occasions directed the attention of the Vestry to the quality of the water supplied, and the Vestry unanimously resolved that the London County Council was the proper authority to control the water supply of London. This is not the place to 18 suggest means whereby this should be done. The Vestry felt that they had discharged their duty when they had recorded their opinion and submitted the same to the London County Council. The question has been raised as to the expenditure incurred by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. At present, its members are delegates from the various Boards of Guardians of the Metropolis, together with a considerable proportion of member, nominated by the Local Government Board. Allusion has already been made to the increased expenditure of this Board ; and, while in such a Parish as this it is eminently desirable that London should be properly supplied with hospitals, the Yestry felt that greater care in the expenditure of public monies might result in a reduction in the rates. They accordingly passed a resolution to the effect that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be elected by the ratepayers, on the same lines as the School Board or the London County Council. It was urged that the system of indirect representation, which as at present obtains, practically deprives the ratepayers of control over a great spending authority ; and as has been more than once mentioned in the Annual Report, considerable difficulty, from time to time, is found in securing admission for those cases for whom this provision is most urgently required. Similarly, in regard to a reform in the local government of London, the Yestry resolved unanimously in favour of a unification scheme, whereby London might possess one central governing authority. The St. Saviour's Vestry, however, have requested this Yestry to consider a scheme for the enlargement of the boundaries of the City proper, so as to include the parishes of Christchurch, St. Saviour's, St. George the Martyr, St. Olave's, and St. John's. This Vestry has arrived at no conclusion on the matter. The question is of the first importance, and turns on a great variety of considerations. If the Legislature proposes at an early date to take in hand the local self-government of London, and re-arrange the areas at present covered by the various Vestries and District Boards, there is much to be said in favour of this Parish forming part of an enlarged City. As is well known, until the reign of Edward IV., Southwark formed part of Bridge Ward Without, but when Bridge Foot ceased to be valuable to the City for strategic purposes, the Borough was excluded 19 perhaps on the ground of its poverty or its turbulence. For certain purposes, however, the City still exercises considerable power in this parish. The Bridge House Estate Commissioners are the largest ground landlords, and the vast majority of its inhabitants work within the City boundaries. It is believed that a Bill will be promoted by the Corporation of London at an early date to secure the inclusion of certain districts, and the Parish will be well advised to take the matter into its careful consideration. An important conference has been held during the past six months and its meetings are not yet ended—to consider what duties, if any, might be transferred from the London County Council to the various Local Authorities. It is often urged that too much detailed work already rests upon the Council, and that some evils of centralisation must sooner or later appear. Inasmuch as the matter is still under consideration, this is not the time to present a final report, but here, again, the Parish would be well advised to pay careful attention to this matter, and if need be, to make their opinions heard. It would appear, however, that the ultimate solution of this problem of devolution must depend on the areas of local self-government which shall be hereafter provided in place of the present Vestries and Boards of Works, and on a readjustment of the burdens of local taxation. One other matter must be mentioned in the period covered by this Report, Mr. Alexander Miller resigned the office of Vestry Clerk after many years of service. Having regard to this fact, the Vestry unanimously voted him a superannuation allowance. He carries with him the regard of many friends, made during nearly 30 years of public life. As Vestryman, as Guardian, as Churchwarden, as Vestry Clerk, he has endeavoured to serve the Parish ; and the wish has been generally expressed that he may long live to enjoy the remembrance of past services. He has been succeeded by Mr. J. A. Johnson, Solicitor, who comes to fill this important office, with high credentials and considerable experience of municipal life.

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Report upon the work carried out under the Surveyor's Department of your Vestry during the year ending March 25th, 1896. My duties as your Surveyor commenced in October, 1895, so that I have had the superintendence of this Department for the latter five months of the period covered by this Report. I have, therefore, thought it desirable to follow the arrangement of the previous Report. The actual cost of the various Works carried out are set forth in full detail, so that the relative expenditure on labour, materials, cartage, &c., can be readily seen. The principal Paving Works, carried out during the year, are as follows:- The completion of the paving of Old Kent Road with Jarrahdale Jarrah Blocks. Borough High Street, from Borough Road to Great Suffolk Street, has been repaved with Jarrahdale Jarrah blocks 3 by 9 by 53/8. Borough High Street from Long Lane to the Parish Boundary, was relaid with wood in May, 1895, by the Improved Wood Pavement Company, under the Contract entered into with them on April 22nd, 1885, for laying and maintaining Wood Paving in this Street for a period of twenty years. The Paving of Marshall Street with redressed Granite Setts was completed early in the year. Webber Street from Blackfriars Road to Webber Row has also been paved with redressed Granite Setts, in substitution for Macadam. 30 In January, 1896, a Loan of £1700 was obtained for paving with redressed Granite Setts portions of Borough Road, Great Suffolk Street, and East Street. The work in Great Suffolk Street has been completed, and the paving of East Street is in progress. The amounts expended on repairs and maintenance of Macadamized Roads and Footway Paving has been much less than in previous years. SEWERS. The Expenditure on the cleansing and flushing of Sewers is a heavy one, considering the total length of the Sewers, and points to serious defects in their condition. This expense would be considerably reduced by the construction of properly designed Sewers, which would be self-cleansing, and also have the important advantage of securing a better sanitary condition of the Parish. The cost of cleaning out tho old brick Sewer in Friar Street entails an average annual charge of over £100. The principal works of repairs and reconstruction of Sewers during the year have been as follows:— Harrow Street and Disney Street, 12 inch pipe and 9 inch pipe Sewers reconstructed, with new flushing tank. The 12 inch pipe Sewer in Temple Street has been taken up and relaid to proper falls. Similar work is now in progress with the 12 inch pipe Sewer in Earl Street. PRIVATE WORKS. A considerable amount of Private Works has been carried out by the Vestry's staff for the various Companies and for private persons. During the past year this work has amounted in all to £1370 5s. 7d., which is an increase of £409 5s. 1d. over the previous year. The winter of 1895-6 was of an exceptionally mild character, and free from snowfalls. The Vestry were, therefore, not confronted with the difficult problem of providing work for the "Unemployed." The re-arrangement of the duties of the Foreman as recommended in my Report to the Works Committee on October 25th, 1895, viz:— that the Foreman of the Scavenging should be relieved of the Street Scavenging, and devote his whole time to the collection of House 31 Refuse, and that the General Foreman should superintend the street scavenging in addition to the works of repair and maintenance, has been carried out with advantage to both Departments. STREET LIGHTING. A trial was made of the Incandescent Gas Burners on 24 Street Lamps, by the South Metropolitan Gas Company from August 7th, 1895, to February 7th, 1896. During this time 195 mantles, 11 forks, 4 chimneys, and 2 new burners were destroyed in connection with the 24 lamps. The Company then intimated that they could not proceed further with the trial unless the Vestry were prepared to pay the cost of the mantles. As I found that this experiment had not been tried under the best conditions, and that further improvements had been introduced in this form of burner for street lamps, I had an interview with the Engineer of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, and he kindly consented to make a further experiment with an improved spring burner on twelve lamps. This trial is now in progress, and I have reason to believe that a more satisfactory result than the last will be reported. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, OLIVER E. WINTER, Assoc. M.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. George the Martyr. section i.—statistical. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fourth Annual Report, which I now have the honour to submit to you, treats of the sanitary condition and environment, for the year 1895, of the most densely populated district in London, and, indeed, for that matter, in the United Kingdom. The following summary of facts will be found useful in approaching the various matters contained in this report. Area.—St. George's, Southwark, covers 284⅓ acres. The roads and streets as returned to the end of 1895, measure 19 miles, 5 furlongs, 14 poles. 4 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Boundaries.—The parish, in shape somewhat like a hatchet, is surrounded by no less than six other Sanitary Districts. It is bounded on the north by St. Saviour and St. Olave, on the west by Lambeth, on the south by Newington and Camberwell, and on the east by Bermondsey. Geological Formation.—The sub-soil of Southwark consists of porous "made" earth, sand, and gravel, of a depth of fifteen to twenty-five feet, overlying the London clay. Saline springs rise at times to the surface, and in certain excavated parts of the parish—e.g., Theatre and Music Hall, necessitate the constant use of pumps. Elevation.—The district is low-lying and flat, and is situate at an average of half a foot below the Trinity high water mark of the Thames, as against a mean elevation for London of 47.5 feet above the same mark. Houses.—At the Census of 1891 there were 6,946 inhabited houses, 732 uninhabited, and 44 building, containing an average of 8.5 persons to a house. According to the 1881 Census, the inhabited houses numbered 6,761—i.e., 185 less than in 1891. The decrease in the number of inhabited houses in the London Road Sub-district may be traced to two chief causes—first, the exodus of population going on steadily from all the central metropolitan districts, which is materially aided by the increasing facilities for cheap transit ; secondly, the demolition and closing of many insanitary houses.

Its number of tenements is almost exactly double that of its inhabited houses. Of the tenement occupiers, one-third live in two rooms, and another third in a single room. There is no reason to alter the statement advanced in last year's report that about 1 in every 14 of your population is born, grows up, drinks, eats, sleeps, works, and often dies within the four walls of a one-roomed tenement. Population.—The number of inhabitants of the whole parish and of each sub-district has not increased in the same proportion as in the rest of London. This fact, which was fully dealt with in my report of 1893, holds good for 1894 and 1895. Births and Birth-Rate. Table II. gives the birth-rate per 1,000 per annum for the years 1893, 1894, and 1895. in each sub-district of the parish, in London, and in the thirty-three large English towns. 5 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. Table II Sub-District. Birth-rate per 1,000. 1893. 1894. 1895.

The diminished rate of increase of population in the three sub-districts of the parish of St. George's is, therefore, not attributable to a falling off in the number of persons born into the parish, but rather to a relatively high death-rate. A reference to the section on the mortality of infants and children will reveal the startling fact that more than onehalf of the total deaths in St. George's, Southwark, takes place under five years of age. The fact is notable that the birth-rate in St. George's is higher than in London and in the thirty-three large towns. This may, I think, be partly explained by the fact that limitation of families is carried into effect by the better-to-do classes rather than by the poor. Deaths and Death-Rate for 1895. 1,253 deaths were registered in the parish during the fifty-two weeks ending December 31st, 1895, giving an average of 24 per week. Of this total 127 were deaths of non-parishioners in hospitals and asylums within the district. In addition 306 parishioners died in outside public institutions and extra metropolitan asylums. There were therefore 1,432 deaths among your parishioners, equivalent to an average mortality of 23.7 per 1,000. The death-rate for all London in the same year was 19.7 per 1,000, which is in itself, according to many authorities, 3 7 more per 1.000 than should occur from "the mortality incident to human nature." In St. George's, then, the "death-toll," as it has been aptly called, claim-! four persons out of every 1,000 in excess of an already excessive rate. On the latter estimate there have been no less than 243 unnecessary deaths in St George's, Southwark, during the year 1895. In the forty-three metropolitan sanitary areas, the lowest death-rates were 12.0 in Hampstead, 13.4 in Stoke Newington, 14.5 in Lee, 14.8 in Wandsworth, 15.1 in Plumstead, and 159 in St. George's, Hanover Square; in the other district the rates ranged upwards to 25.6 in St. Saviour's, Southwark, 27.7 in Limehouse,s 29.7 in St. George's in the East, and 30.1 in St. Luke's. Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The facts of your death-rate are briefly as follows :— Table III. Sub-District. No. of Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000.

One is naturally led to enquire whether a further analysis of facts and figure; will throw any light upon this unenviable state of affairs. On comparing the average death-rate in the Three Sub-districts for the years 1892-3-4-5, with that of 1895, we find :— Table IV. Sub-District. Death-rate per 1,000. 1892-3-4-5 1895 Borough Road 33.9 33.0 London Road 20.4 19.8 Kent Road 20.6 19.1 Hence we see the heavy death-rate in the Borough Road Sub-district has some what decreased. It is a suggestive fact that during the past year the mortality in the Borough Road has been 13.2 over that of the London Road, and 139 over that of the Kent Road areas. The period over which these figures extend—four years,— and the actual number of deaths are both too small to allow of drawing any absolutely sound conclusions. Nevertheless, it may be noticed that:— (1) The mortality of the Borough Road Sub-district is 4.2 higher than that of Liverpool for the year 1895. The latter place had the highest death-rate of the thirty-three large English towns. (2) That of the London Road Sub-district, is almost the same as that for the thirty-three large provincial towns, and only slightly higher than that of the whole of London. (3) That of the Kent Road Sub-district is below the figure returned for the whole of London, and for the thirty-three great towns. 6 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 7 Although there is certainly some reason for alarm at the death-rate of the Borough Road Sub-district, yet one cannot help feeling a good deal of satisfaction with the figures for the whole parish during the past year. The annual death-rate for 1895 has dropped to 23.7 as against 239 in 1894. This fall of 0.2 brings the result within 4 of that of the whole of London. Moreover, if we take the recorded rate for the past 50 years we find that there has been a decrease from 30 in the decade 1841-50 to 2.37 in 1895. It is highly gratifying to be able to report that the yearly decrease in the death-rate has been maintained. There need, therefore, be no change in comment on this point made in last year's report. The passage in question dwelt on the encouraging fact that the death-rate of this parish touched the lowest point recorded for the last half century ; in fact, since official returns of this kind have been systematically recorded. These results certainly appear. on the face of them, to furnish proof of the value of sanitary progress to the community. At the same time it should be borne in mind that there is still room for large and permanent reduction in the death-rate of St. George the Martyr. Table V. Years. St. George, Southwark. London.

It may be noted that the term "zymotic'' applies to the following seven diseases-:—Small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, "fever" (i.e., typhus, relapsing, puerperal, simple continued and typhoid), and diarrhoea. I have called the above zymotic diseases " preventable," because I regard all communicable disease, broadly speaking, as coming under that heading. Diarrhoea is a symptom rather than a disease, and, although not usually communicated from one person to another, it may be regarded as the almost invariable result of bad environment. At the same time, it must be clearly understood that a vast amount of preventable disease, such as that due to alcoholism, is not zymotic in the ordinary sense of the term—that is to say, disease communicable from the sick to the healthy. The corrected death-rate in St. George's, Southwark, from the seven principal zymotic diseases was 3.8 per 1,000 in 1895, as against 2.6 per 1,000 in the whole of London for the same period, and 2.8 in the thirty-three great towns of England and Wales. As in the calculation of the general death-rate, so with the zymotic death-rate, the deaths of non-parishioners occurring within the district have been excluded ; whilst on the other hand the deaths of parishioners in public institutions outside the parish have been included. Unless a proper distribution of these deaths be made, 8 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. especially of those from zymotic diseases, no really trustworthy data can be secured upon which to calculate the rates of mortality. In the forty-three sanitary areas of the metropolis the zymotic death-rates ranged from 1.0 in Hampstead, 1.1 Stoke Newington, 1.3 in St. James', Westminster, and Wandsworth; and the highest 32 in Mile End, 3.8 in St. George's, Southwark, 4.2 in Bermondsey, 4.6 in Limehouse, and 5.4 in St. George's in the East. Proposed Reception House. Hardly any part of the system of prevention of the spread of infectious disease is of more importance than the provision of a shelter for infected persons. It is, therefore, highly gratifying to me as your Medical Officer to be able to report that during the past year your Vestry has decided to erect such a building. This step is calculated to put a check upon one hitherto uncontrolled source of disease and death in this crowded centre of population, and will, in the long run, doubtless lead to a great saving not only of life but also of money to the community. The whole scope of this question, which is one of the most advanced, and at the same time practical applications of modern sanitary science, is discussed fully in a special report, an abstract of which will be found on page 48. I may add that similar refuges have been either built, or are about to be built, in twenty of the Metropolitan districts. An excellent site, adjoining the Stone Yard, has been acquired from the Bridge House Estate. On this ground it has been arranged to erect an eight-roomed house, with baths and all necessary appliances. It is to be earnestly hoped, in the interests of the poor of St. George's, that before many months have gone by the parish will be provided with this desirable building. Table VI.—For the Year 1895.

The mortality from measles, whooping cough, and diphtheria is seen from the foregoing table to be excessive in St. George's as compared with all London. The absence of deaths from small-pox is in itself a valuable evidence as to the efficiency of modern preventive measures of vaccination, together with notification and prompt isolation. The most remarkable point in the table is, perhaps, the diarrhoea mortality. On the one hand, the actual number of deaths in St. George's shows a decrease of one-tenth in 1895 as compared with 1894. On the other hand, the London mortality shows an increase, and in 1895 is double that of 1894 (49 to 24). If the deaths from diarrhoea in St. George's had taken place in the same proportion as in London generally, there would have been 147 deaths to register from diarrhoea in 1895. This statement of results must be recognised as significant, even if we make full allowance for the fact that in St. George's we are dealing with small figures as compared with the general returns of the Metropolis. Thus far all is plain sailing, a mere analysis of figures, but when we come to the consideration of cause and effect, the subject becomes involved in many difficulties. Epidemic diarrhoea is usually associated with hot weather, and to that active influence the exceedingly high mortality from diarrhoea in the year 1895 is generally attributed. The condition of high temperature, however, with its influence on water, on milk, food generally, and on various other conditions of environment, applies equally to St. George's, Southwark, and to the whole of London. So that the summer drought of 1895 does not seem to afford an adequate explanation of the diarrhoea deaths in this parish. Without attempting to analyse this extremely intricate and difficult problem, it may be pointed out that diarrhoea in itself is a symptom of a disease. The decrease in the death figures from diarrhoea may, in my opinion, be not unreasonably attributed to the following facts:— (1) An increased sanitary standard in your parish. (2) A more scientific recognition on the part of medical men of the diseases hitherto returned under the heading of diarrhoea. In conclusion, it may be remarked there is hardly any subject brought within the scope of the Registrar General's Department which appears to afford a more promising field for systematic research than the scientific investigation of the mortality from diarrhoea. Diarrhoea, like measles, claims every year its toll of victims from amongst this teeming population. As a homely disease it would seem to have hitherto escaped a due measure of curative and. preventive treatment. In the interest of the crowded population of this district, I would suggest that in future diarrhoea be included in the list of diseases to be compulsorily notified to the Sanitary Authority of this parish. It may be as well to add that in all probability cases of typhoid fever (especially in childen) and of advanced kidney disease are often certified as diarrhoea. Measles, Measles is still the most deadly complaint in your parish. It is not notified, and so works its ravages practically unchecked. The following view of the case was presented to your Vestry on the 4th of June, 1895*:— The death rate from measles is high, and heads the table of mortality from zymotic diseases, both in St. George's, Southwark, and in the whole of London. In St. George's it has been more fatal than throughout London generally, in the proportion of 71 to 36. * In this Report the figures for the year 1895 have been substituted for those of 1894. 10 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. This waste of life, in my opinion, may be traced to the following causes:— (1) Measles, although highly infectious, is non-notifiable, and, therefore, outside the control of your Sanitary Authority. (2) It is generally looked upon as a mild disorder that wants little or no treatment, whereas it requires careful isolation and nursing, as it is liable to many grave accidents. (3) Bad environment: measles does little harm among the well-to-do, but among the poor it is estimated that twenty to thirty die out of every 100 attacked by the disease. The Notification of Measles. With regard to this important question, I think that the compulsory notification of cases of measles, with subsequent hospital treatment and disinfection, could not fail to result in a great saving of life. If compulsory notification be a fit and proper step in other zymotic disorders, such as scarlet fever or diphtheria, there is no reason, as far as one can see, why measles, which actually claims a greater number of victims, should not also be notifiable. During the year 1895 measles caused 71 deaths in your parish, whereas scarlet fever killed 14, diphtheria 19, typhoid 9, and small-pox 0. In London, during the same period, 2,632 deaths resulted from measles and 55 from small-pox. If measles were included under the list of notifiable diseases, no doubt a large increase of hospital accommodation would be required, at any rate for several years to come. Into that aspect of the case, however, it is not my duty to enter. As your Medical Officer I have only to point out that in measles we find an ever-increasing course of avoidable death in this parish, and one which, in my opinion, would be materially reduced if dealt with in the same manner as most other infectious diseases. To some extent a precisely similar line of reasoning applies to whoopingcough, which during the year 1895 was answerable for 56 deaths in St. George's, as against 1,483 in London. The affection is highly infectious, liable to lung complications, and is regarded by parents as a trifling disorder, requiring little or no treatment. Decreased Parish Mortality from Diphtheria. There has been a remarkable falling off in deaths from diphtheria. During last year (1895) the total cases were 19 only, as againt 49 for the preceding year. In St. George's it has been less fatal than throughout London generally, in the proportion of 19 to 31. The Salvation Army Shelter. This institution, as I mentioned in last year's report, was founded by Mr. Booth for the night shelter of poor persons. Although, no doubt, started on philanthropic lines, a charge is made for accommodation, and there is no attempt to disguise the fact that enterprises of a similar kind are not only self-supporting, but are even carried on at a profit. Notwithstanding this commercial aspect of the case, in the Court of Appeal, Her Majesty's Judges decided that these Shelters did not fall within the regulations of the Common Lodging Houses Act. Another judicial decision showed that such institutions did not come under the Public Health (London) Act so far as disinfection was concerned. On that occasion Mr. Justice Wills said that "the case was clearly one in which the Act ought to apply, but does not." Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 11 The need of an extension of the powers of your Local Authority in dealing with shelters of the kind may be judged from the following considerations:— (1) In 1893 thirty-one cases of small-pox were referred, directly or indirectly, to the Blackfriars Army Shelter, and nine such cases in 1895. (2) The overcrowding which is clearly shown in the two Special Reports on the subject (for which see page 26 of the Appendix). For my own part, as your responsible Medical Officer, so long ago as 1892 I felt it my duty to point out that the presence of a Shelter, in the midst of this crowded district, constituted a real danger to the rest of the community—that is to say, in the absence of thorough and efficient control. Respiratory Diseases. Table VIII. Sub-District. No. of Deaths—1895. Total No. of Deaths—1894. Total Bronchitis Pneumonia Phthisis Bronchitis Pneumonia Phthisis Borough Road 54 48 36 138 43 30 28 101 London Road 63 32 29 124 74 35 22 131 Kent Road 62 44 26 132 64 48 19 131 Total 179 124 91 394 181 113 69 363 In 1892 the total mortality under this heading was 539, which fell to 419 in 1893, and to 363 in 1894, and has risen to 394 in 1895. This rate is above that of the whole of London. The excess may, I think, be traced to the overcrowded state of the parish, both as to tenements and to workshops, and to the number of indoor occupations which predispose to respiratory diseases. A good deal of the mortality among young children is due to lung troubles, which often follow measles and whooping cough. The returns of deaths from consumption are not so heavy as one would expect in so densely crowded and poverty-stricken a district. At the same time it should be noted that the registrars have to depend for these figures on the death certificates, and there can be no doubt that a certain number of cases are not correctly described. This applies especially to alcoholism, and to such hereditary and constitutional disorders as syphilis or consumption. Mortality of Infants and Children. The death-rates of infants under one year, and of children under five years, afford valuable indirect evidence of the sanitary well-being of a community. By this I do not mean that all preventable infant and child mortality is to be attributed to defective sanitation. Other factors—to be mentioned further on— doubtless play a considerable part in either destroying or crippling the lives of these slum-bred children. The fact remains, however, that the most sensitive test of the sanitary condition of a district lies in the death-rate prevailing among its young population. During 1895 the number of infants who died within the first year of life in St. George's was 452. These figures give the high rate of 208 deaths to every 1,000 births in St. George's, as compared with 165 deaths per 1,000 births for London. The average rate for the four years 1892-3-4-5, for St. George's, was 206, and for the Borough Road Sub-district 235, as against 155 for London. 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Of a total of 1,432 deaths at all ages in St. George's, 744 occurred under five years, which gives the large percentage of 51.8 of the total number of deaths. It is well-known to specialists in children's diseases that "wasting" constitutes one of the commonest causes of death among infants. Thousands of children die every year in London simply because they are fed on food which they cannot digest, and which acts as an irritant to the stomach and intestines. The following are the most prominent Diseases causing the Infant Mortality under One Year of Aae :— TABLE IX. Deaths 1892. Deaths 1893. Deaths 1894.

This ill-defined group refers mainly to chronic wasting disease, produced by malnutrition, which is again a consequence of improper feeding. The infants fed on mother's milk for the most part escape these fatal consequences, which chiefly affect children brought up by hand. TABLE X. Sanitary Area. Estimated Population middle of 1895.

In a similar analysis of the death-rates in the South London Districts for 1894, St. George's, Southwark, headed the list with a mortality of 239 deaths per 1000 of population. This year, with a fall of .2 in the rate of deaths from all causes, your parish comes fourth on the list. In view of the fact that the total mortality for all London has risen 2.4, during the past year the return from St. George's, Southwark, as fourth on the list, may be regarded as pointing to a progressive and satisfactory improvement in the health of the district. St. George's, Southwark, has still the highest zymotic death-rate, but comes second in proportion to infantile deaths instead of first as in 1894. Your parish still remains the most densely populated area in the United Kingdom. The many causes leading to loss of infant life in St. George's may be thus summarised :— (1) Bad environment, such as insanitary conditions, overcrowding and absence of parks and open spaces. (2) Improper and insufficient food. (3) Mismanagement through maternal ignorance. (4) Early marriages. (5) Debility and disease of parents. (5) Maternal neglect, due to mothers being more or less employed away from home in factories and workshops. (6) Use of opiates; usually in the form of patent medicines. The question of how to lessen the excessive destruction of child-life is an important one. It is a complex result traceable to many causes, each of which demands careful consideration and separate treatment. Among general measures it may be broadly stated that anything which tends to raise the standard of wholesomeness of a district will also help to diminish the infantile death-rate. Another valuable aid to prevention would be the education of parents generally in the simpler laws of healthy living with special reference to the diet and clothing of their offspring. Without active and intelligent help on the part of those interested in the care of children, special treasures of the local authorities will be of little avail in checking the disastrous loss of life which occurs under five years of age in all our great centres of population. Before leaving this subject I would again allude to one special measure which I have urged upon your Vestry ever since my appointment as Medical Officer of Health, namely, the formation of creches. The necessary site for such a day nursery might perhaps be found in the Falcon Court Area, which should be available to a greater or less extent for public purposes. Another portion of the Area might with advantage be laid out as a play-ground for the children of this poor and crowded district. 14 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Table XI.

Section II.—GENERAL. The Need of Further Public Lavatory Accommodation. Under the powers conferred by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, your Authority constructed an underground convenience near the " Elephant and Castle,' in the year 1893. This Lavatory was built for men only, and has proved, by its steady and increasing income, that it has satisfied a public want. I would now suggest that the Vestry considerably increase the present Public Lavatory accommodation, which is needed, not only for the inhabitants of this populous parish, but for the many wayfarers that pass through its busy streets. Two sites that appear to me particularly suitable for the purpose are:—first, the junction of the Old and New Kent Roads; and, the other, the Obelisk at St. George's Circus. Experience has shown that these underground conveniences become a paying parish property from an economical point of view, particularly as the money required for their construction may be borrowed under the Act. Before leaving this matter, I may, perhaps, point out that, according to modern views, this kind of necessary accommodation should be provided for women, as well as for men. As a first step in a right direction, a Women's Lavatory might be addded to the one existing near the " Elephant and Castle." The Partial Breakdown in the South London Water Supply. The public inquiry into the causes of the failure of the supply of Water to Dwelling-houses in Southwark during the frost of 1895 was instituted by the Local Government Board, and carried out in May last, by Major-General A. de C. Scott. In the course of the inquiry the following information regarding the Water Supply to St. George's, furnished by (a) the Lambeth Company, and (b) the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, was given by me :— 1. That, in my opinion, a serious danger to health, due to want of water, was present during a period commencing at the latter end of January, and extending into April, and that this danger was markedly manifest in the crowded and lofty " Model" Dwellings which, in St. George's alone, house upwards of 12,800 persons. 2. That the failure of the Water Supply was more or less due to— (a) The fact of the communication pipes and mains having been laid at a depth insufficient to protect them from the effects of frost. (b) The freezing of water in domestic supply pipes and cisterns, which is often traceable to their unprotected condition. (c) Neglect of the Companies to provide water in dwelling-houses at a pressure in any way approaching that fixed by their special or private Acts. e.g.—This state of affairs actually occurred and was seen by Major-General Scott, after the frost, in the case of a " Model " Dwelling accommodating upwards of 3,000 persons, and supplied with water by the Lambeth Company. The block building in question is a five-storied one, and about 80 feet in height. The water was gauged as reaching the second storey only. 17 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 3. That the stand-pipes set up by the Companies were inadequate in number, and were not allowed to remain in use for a sufficiently long period during each day. 4. That, in addition to other evils, the necessity of carrying water from the stand-pipes to the tenements of lofty " Models " was both inconvenient and costly to tenants. Copies of my Annual Reports, which deal with the subject of the Parish water supply for domestic use, were handed by me to Major-General Scott, and his attention particularly drawn to the following marked passage:— "In a few of the "Model" Dwellings I have induced the owners to supply water direct from the rising main. The cisterns, periodically cleansed, supply the water-waste preventors in the water-closets; and in times of need only, a tap attached to the head of a pipe coming from the cistern, and joining the rising main, affords a temporary and secondary supply. This system, particularly with a constant supply, is found to work admirably in practice. " This plan, however, cannot be applied in the case of lofty " Model " Dwellings supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company. The reason for this is that the Company fails to carry out the obligations to provide water at the pressure clearly laid down in their private Act, which would more than reach the highest flat in Southwark." It cannot be too frequently repeated that cisterns for the supply of drinking water are often the means of sowing broadcast the germs of diarrhoea, typhoid fever, and cholera. Moreover, they are more frequently than not badly placed ; and in times of frost, owing to their exposed position, the water within them is converted into ice, and the tenant has perforce to seek his water from the standpipe, or else go without. With the constant system of water supply now in vogue to nearly 80 per cent, of the houses in London, one would like to see, and at the first blush be inclined to anticipate, the gradual disappearance of the cistern into the limbo of the past, along with the wood-rotting water butt and other nearly obsolete sanitary abominations. Under existing conditions, however, such a radical cure is, in my opinion, likely to prove infinitely worse than the disease itself, and until some better and more practical remedy be introduced, the cistern, used only when water is obtained from the rising main, will have to be tolerated as a necessary evil. Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. 1890, s. 26 (2), and 1891, s. 4. Sixteen tenements, occupied by about 90 persons, have been examined by me during 1895. This duty has been performed at the request of the respective owners, with a view to the granting of certificates by your Medical Officer, by virtue of which exemption from inhabited house duty may be claimed under the provisions of the Acts. The Act of 1890 provides that, " before exemption from duty can be claimed the house be so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision be made for their sanitary requirements." The Act of 1891 stipulates that the annual value of each separate dwelling within the house " shall not amount to .£20." Certificates were given in each of these sixteen cases in which application was made. 18 / Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. It is noteworthy that the Inland Revenue Acts throw the burden and responsibility of making a thorough inspection of houses, with a view to the levying of Imperial taxes, upon the Local Authorities. No definition, moreover, is given, of what is meant by the somewhat vague and elastic expressions " suitable accommodation " and " sanitary requirements," the interpretation of these phrases being left to the judgment of the individual Medical Officer of Health. Alcohol. The drink problem nowhere presses for solution with more urgency than in a poor and crowded district such as St. George's, Southwark. It seems likely, judging from the general trend of public opinion, that the question of environment has much to do with the alcoholic craving of the individual. This view of the subject has been fully dealt with in an article written by Dr. David Walsh and myself, and published in the "North American Review." The importance of the matter has led me to reprint the above-mentioned contribution, which will be found at page 33 of thejAppendix. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. Two hundred and seven bodies were removed to the parish mortuary during the year 1895, as against 190 in 1894, 236 in 1893, and 191 in 1892. This number includes bodies brought from the St. George's Workhouse. Post-mortem examinations and inquests were held in 92 cases, and inquests alone in 30 cases. During 1895 sixteen young children were suffocated whilst lying in bed with their parents, as against 20 in 1894. This lamentable loss of life might have been prevented had these unfortunate children slept in cots. The following list shows the particular morning upon which the above-mentioned sixteen infants were found suffocated in bed :— Sunday Mornings 5 Monday ,, 2 Tuesday ,, 1 Wednesday ,, 8 Thursday ,, 1 Friday ,, 1 Saturday ,, 8 Total 16 The provision of a separate chamber for the deposit of infectious bodies—suggested in my reports for 1893 and 1894—has been put into effect during the latter portion of the year. At the same time, the ventilation of the mortuary has been improved, and seven bodies of those who have died from infectious diseases have already been deposited in the chamber set apart for such purpose. A copy of the new Regulations for the Mortuary may be found on page 50 of the Appendix. 19 The Factory and Workshop Act, 1891. 242 Workshops have been registered by your Authority since January, 1892, when the Act first came into operation. Of this number 78 have been added during the past year. In many of these cases, I am glad to say, that registration has led to either the abatement or the removal of nuisances such as filth, overcrowding, and bad ventilation. Special attention has been given to the water-closets, both as to sufficiency and to a separate accommodation for the sexes. The late Home Secretary's Order, under Section 27 (1) of the Act, first took effect on the 20th November, 1892. It was made in the interests of the public and of those employed in " domestic workshops." The Order remains only partly enforced in this parish, and will continue so unless some means be devised to lighten the more pressing duties of the Sanitary Inspectors. In my Reports for 1893 and 1894, I said that, in my opinion, a special inspector would be required to carry the Order out thoroughly in your district. This view of the question I would respectfully urge upon the attention of your Vestry. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1895. This important measure introduced by the late Home Secretary, Mr. Asquith, comes into force on the 1st day of January, 1896. It forms a considerable advance on previous legislation both in raising the standard of industrial environment, and in giving increased powers to the Authorities. The chief points may be briefly touched upon. First and foremost, it provides that a factory or workshop shall be deemed overcrowded if there be less than 250 feet of cubic space to each person during the hours of work, and of 400 cubic feet during overtime. It authorises a magistrate, on complaint of an Inspector, and being satisfied that a factory or workshop is in a dangerous or injurious condition, to prohibit the place from being used until such works as are necessary to remove the danger have been executed. Adequate penalties are provided against the employment of persons in work injurious to health, or for allowing wearing apparel to be made up, cleaned, or repaired in places where there is scarlet fever or small-pox. It also directs that a full notification and register of deaths from accident be kept by owners or occupiers, and that the Factory Inspector attend the subsequent inquest, while the Home Secretary is furnished with powers for additional investigation if he deem fit. A number of fresh Regulations have been passed with regard to laundries, which are now, for the first time, brought under the control of the Inspectors. Numerous provisions have been made with a view to enforcing the duties of employers in the observance of sanitation, of the fencing of machines, of the affixing of notices, and of the general carrying out of their responsibilities under the Act. It is worthy of special note, that in the case of tenement factories the owner is made responsible in place of the occupier. Sewage Flooded Basements in Southwark. The question of basement floodings in various low-lying parts of the metropolis has been for some years past under the notice of the London County Council. The Main Drainage Committee of that body, appointed to investigate and report, made the following proposals :— Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. (a) That one additional outfall sewer 9 feet in diameter be constructed between Old Ford and Barking, together with the necessary bridges to carry another sewer of similar capacity, and that the engineer be instructed to have the working drawings prepared and lithographed, and the quantities taken out, with a view to exact estimates of the cost being prepared, and to the work being put in hand with as little delay as possible. (b) That an intercepting sewer be constructed from Paddington to Old Ford, and that the engineer be instructed to prepare the necessary specification, plans, and estimate of the cost of the work. (c) That the relief works above mentioned be carried out, and that the engineer be instructed to prepare the necessary plans and estimates of the cost. From this report it is evident that these proposals, if carried out, would not in any way affect the South of London. It is satisfactory to note, therefore, when the recommendations were last before the Council, they accepted an important amendment brought forward by Mr. McDougall, to the effect that " The general enlargement of the main drainage system is not now necessary, but that local floodings need immediate attention." Under these circumstances St. George's, Southwark, may hope that some speedy and practical steps will be taken to do away with the basement flooding, which for many years past has been a scandal and eyesore to the parish.

Houses and tenements, respecting which representations were made to the Vestry that they were in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. Houses and tenements 105 Inhabitants 525 During the years 1892, 1893, 1894, and 1895, applications have been made for Closing Orders in the case of 261 houses and tenements unfit for human habitation. These dwellings have sheltered upwards of 1,500 persons, and I think some steps should be taken to re-house those whose occupations necessitate their living in or near the district. I would again respectfully commend the serious attention of your Sanitary Authority towards the equitable solution of this pressing problem. Section 30, of the Act states that, " It shall be the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of every district to represent to the Local Authority of that district any dwelling-house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious tc health as to be unfit for human habitation." In compliance with this direction I have from time to time advised your Vestry (the Authority under the Act), to apply for Closing Orders with respect to some of the worst class of slum-property in Southwark. Moreover after closure for a term of certain of these houses, your Vestry have made and carried into effect orders for demolition. Certain unwholesome dwellings which can be put into an habitable condition have been reported to your Health Committee. Such houses have been closed pending alterations—under the provisions of the Public Health Act. It should, however, be clearly understood that those dwelling-houses which can be dealt with only by demolition, if a due regard be paid to health considerations, are usually taken under the Housing Act. If closed by virtue of the less stringent Health Act, there is nothing to prevent their remaining a standing danger, for an indefinite period, to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwellings, and to the public generally.

The general provisions of the Act enforces 400 cubic feet of air space for each workman engaged in a retail bakehouse. They also appear to allow the Local Authorities to proceed against the owner, as well as the occupier, for certain offences committed in any such bakehouse. The special requirements of the Act, as regards retail bakehouses, are as follows :— "Sect. 27.—(1) Sections 34 and 35 of the principal Act shall apply to every bakehouse, and so much of those Sections as limits the operation thereof to cities, towns, and places, having a population of more than five thousand persons shall be repealed." (2) In Section 15 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, the words "which was not so let or occupied before the first day of June, 1883," shall be repealed. *(3) A place under ground shall not be used as a bakehouse, unless it is so used at the commencement of this Act, and if any place is so used in contravention of this Act, it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with the principal Act." The gist of Sections 34 and 35 of the 1878 Act, and Sections 15 and 16 of the 1883 Act, referred to in the above quotation, may be found under " Regulations for Bakehouses " in the Appendix. It will be seen, after 30 years of tentative legislation, Government has recognised the fact that the underground bakehouses should cease to exist. The prohibition of any underground work-place used afresh as a bakery after the 1st January, 1896, may be reasonably regarded as a first step towards their entire removal. Those who are interested in the subject of bakehouse construction and law will find the matter entered into very fully in the Appendix. The Notification of Infectious and other Diseases. Certain infectious diseases have been made notifiable in London since the passing of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. They comprise:—small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membraneous croup, erysipelas, the disease known as scarlatina or scarlet fever, and the fevers known by any of the following names:—typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued, or puerperal. * For explanation of this sub-section see correspondence, re Cellar Bakeries. Page 43. 24 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. In 1895 the sum in fees paid to medical practitioners for notifying 456 infectious cases in St. George's amounted to £46 5s. 6d. This amount, paid in the first instance by your Vestry, is recouped by the Asylums Board, and charged to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. 46 per cent. of the total number of cases notified in the parish during 1895 were removed to the Asylums Board and other hospitals. During 1892, 67 per cent., in 1893, 34 per cent., and in 1894, 44 per cent. of such cases were treated in these institutions. The decrease of admissions during 1893, 1894, and 1895 was due to the overcrowded state of the hospitals. My experience of the past year shows that there is urgent need for further hospital accommodation for infectious diseases. It is important to bear in mind that prompt isolation alone can obviate the danger resulting from the detention of infectious patients in so poor and densely packed a district as St. George's. During the year the list of notifiable diseases has received several important additions, to wit, anthrax and cases of poisioning by lead, arsenic, and phosphorus. These notifications do not come under the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889, but are made under the new Factories and Workshop Act. They are paid for at the rate of 2s. 6d. per case, as a charge upon the Public Funds, and not at the cost of the Local Authorities. In this way, the notifying of diseases, which are for the most part industrial, is distributed evenly among poor and wealthy districts. A similar soundness of principle, however, does not in any way extend to the further condition that these new notifications must be made direct to the Chief Inspector of Factories. Such a course means that the Medical Officer of Health is kept in official ignorance of the existence of diseases that swell the mortality of his district. Falcon Court and Neighbourhood. I am glad to be able to report that in the near future there is every likelihood that the present area of Falcon Court and its neighbourhood will be swept away, and that this unwholesome area will be wholly or partially replaced by an open-air space. In that case it is to be earnestly hoped that a portion will be set apart as a playground for children, the need of which I have urged upon your Vestry, as well as upon the London County Council, in my annual reports for several years past. The scheme about to be submitted to the Local Government Board will be found at page 57 of the Appendix. * * * * * In concluding this report, I may once again congratulate your Vestry on another year of progress in health matters. There has been a fall of .2 per 1,000 in the death-rate, which has reached a lower point than any on record during the past half century. It is gratifying to be able to point to a solid and practical result of this kind, in view of the ever-increasing load of work and responsibility which is cast upon Local Authorities and their Medical Officer of Health. So long as I am honoured with the confidence of your Vestry it will be my earnest endeavour to carry out the duties of the important office with which I have been entrusted, with all necessary care and vigilance. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, Medical Officer of Health. 1 Plowden Buildings, Temple, January, 1896. 25 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. APPENDIX.

Referring to the 12 cases of small-pox within the fortnight ending 13th July, and of the additional one reported at previous meeting, I beg to state that out of the above 13 cases, five came directly from the shelter. In addition, several of the workhouse cases sprang from the original patient B. L. reported on the 19th June. and who, in all probability, contracted small-pox within the Blackfriars Shelter. These workhouse cases are, therefore, indirectly traceable to the Shelter. How many of the remaining cases may be traced to the same source, I am not at present in a position to state, but I think I shall not be far wrong in saying that the greater proportion of cases of small-pox that have occurred in this district during the past fortnight have arisen from the original case of B. L. The extent of the iufection spread by the original case is by no means confined to this parish. I have received spontaneous information from the following metropolitan districts of small-pox cases in patients who have slept in the Shelter during the period of infection. Date of Information. Date in Shelter. H. K. St. Giles 8th July Fortnight before. E. M. Limehouse 8th July 15 days previous. T. S. Whitechapel 10th July Exact date not given. M. H. Limehouse 13th July Within a few days of 13th July. Further, in reply to a letter, asking for information, I find five cases reported by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, all of which had been exposed to infection in this particular Shelter within a recent period. After the first case of small-pox, that of B. L., was reported from the Salvation Shelter, feeling anxious as to the possibility of an out-break, I determined to visit the Shelter in person. Accordingly, on the night of the 24th of June, in company of Mr. Edwards, your chief inspector, I visited the Shelter. On that occasion I was refused admission. On reporting the refusal to the Health Committee I was instructed to apply for a Justice's Warrant to enter and inspect the premises. This warrant was obtained on the 6th of July. On the night of Sunday, the 7th, a few minutes before 1 a.m., in company with my assistants, I presented the warrant and demanded entry. Forcible resistance was offered to my entry, and it was only on a threat of bringing up a strong force of police that I was allowed to enter. Without going into minute detail, I may say that my visit disclosed overcrowding of the grossest character, along with utterly inadequate ventilation. In order to satisfy the legal requirements of the case I have handed in to the Vestry Clerk a certificate of overcrowding in the Blackfriars Shelter. 26 Parish of st. George the Martyr, Southwark. The following incident in the course of the epidemic is worthy of note:— One of the patients I found sitting in the disinfector and the second in the passage dormitory within a few feet of another inmate. Whilst examining and notifying this latter case last week between 1 and 2 a.m. the infected inmate made his escape into the interior of the shelter. Having taken careful note of the man, I asked permission of the superintendent to allow me to enter the shelter and isolate the man. This request was met with a flat refusal, and the man was left to infect his neighbours. Special Report on the Blackfriars Salvation Army Shelter Prosecution* TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, You will naturally expect a few words from me as your Medical Officer of Health, upon the important police-court prosecution lately undertaken by your Vestry against the superintendent of the Salvation Army Shelter in the Blackfriars Road. First of all the Vestry may be congratulated upon the fact that a danger to the common safety, although not altogether abolished, has nevertheless been brought nearer a proper sanitary control. In this way the Vestry of St. George the Martyr has carried out a public-spirited policy which deserves the thanks of every local authority in London. The history of the facts which led up to the Blackfriars prosecution is simple. For three years past I have called attention, in my annual reports, to the dangers arising from the presence of these over-crowded and ill-regulated pseudo-charities in your midst. The dangers in question may be divided under two heads, according to their injurious effect. (1st) Directly on inmates of the shelter. (2nd) Indirectly, on the outside public. Copies of the reports dealing with these points have been duly laid before the Local Government Board and the London County Council. In 1893 the Government sent Dr. Airy to inspect the Metropolitan Night Shelters, but his report has not been made public, neither has the Local Government Board, so far as I know in my official capacity, taken any further steps in the matter, nor has the London County Council interfered. This was the position of affairs in the summer of the present year, when an outbreak of small-pox occurred in your parish, and out of 44 cases no less than nine were traced directly to the Shelter. I thereupon applied one night at the Shelter for admission, which was refused, and I then drew the attention of the Committee to the occurrence. I was next instructed by your Committee to apply to the local magistrate for a warrant to enter the Shelter on the night of the 8th July. As a result of that visit your Committee obtained a summons asking for prohibition against future over-crowding. After a protracted hearing, extending over four months, the magistrate (Mr. Slade) granted the order asked for, and stated that, personally, he would not regard the presence of anything under 550 inmates as overcrowding. It is worthy of note that despite the strong assertions of defendant's counsel in the course of the trial, no appeal has been made against the decision of the magistrate. It may be well to add a few remarks upon the scientific evidence furnished in Court. The chemist who acted for your Vestry found 75 parts of carbonic-acid gas per 10,000 of air, in what was known as the "two-penny overflow bunk room,'' * See report to Vestry July 30th, 1895. 27 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. whereas the usual limit regarded by sanitary officers as permissible is 6 parts of carbonic acid per 10,000. The chemist for the defence (Mr. Wanklyn) stated the figure 75 per 10,000 was impossible. Without entering at length into the matter, I may say that Mr. Wanklyn's view runs counter to all standard scientific teaching and experience. Pettenkofer, for instance, one of the greatest living authorities on the subject, found 73.2 parts per 10,000 in a girls' school. Mr. Wanklyn tested the air in the " two-penny overflow bunk room," and found 8.6 carbonic acid per 10,000. His figure 8 6 offers a startling contrast from our own figure of 75. It is easily explained, however, by the facts that Mr. Wanklyn took his sample at an earlier hour of the night, and that between our visit of the 8th July and his experiment, extensive alterations had been carried out in the ventilation of the particular room in question. This dispute between the chemists is unfortunate, because it tends to draw attention away from the main issue. It is entirely unnecessary, moreover, for I am prepared to state from the evidence of my own senses, apart from any chemical examination, that the air of the " twopenny overflow bunk room " on the night of July 8th was not only dangerous to health, but also to life itself. In this view I am supported by Dr. Walsh, who was with me on the night of the visit. Besides, a foul condition of the air followed, as a necessary result, from the gross over-crowding and the defective ventilation of the place. I may add that not a single Medical Officer of Health could be found to give evidence for Mr. Booth in favour of the sanitary condition of the Shelter. On the other hand, my contentions as to unwholesomeness were supported by no less than five Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health, to say nothing of independent medical and scientific testimony. According to my estimate, the Blackfriars Shelter was able to accommodate 401 persons. On the night of entry I found 1,031. On two other occasions, on the admission of the Shelter officials, the numbers varied from 743 to 1,045. When the magistrate, therefore, placed the limit at 550 he convicted the Blackfriars Shelter authorities of gross overcrowding. As regards the decision of Mr. Slade, I may say that, in my opinion, the Vestry is not bound to accept the figure of 550, in the absence of any knowledge upon what basis that number has been fixed. At the same time it would, of course, be unwise to adopt any other standard in any possible future proceedings. For my own part, I see no reason why the Vestry should lessen the reasonable demand for 30 square feet floor space, and 300 cubic feet air space for each inmate. This is the minimum I regard as necessary in the presence, I need hardly add, of free ventilation. The weak point in the present position apears to be in the fact that your officers have no right of entry at night for purposes of inspection. As a matter of fact, I myself was refused admission in June last, and even when armed with a Justice's warrant I obtained an entrance only in the face of forcible resistance, and under the threat of bringing up a strong force of police. In conclusion, it may be confidently expected that the action of your Vestry will sooner or later bring these shelters, and other night refuges of a similar nature, within the control of the Common Lodging Houses Act. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, St. George's, Southwark, 3rd December, 1895. 28 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Report upon the Deficiency of Fever Accommodation for Fever cases in the Asylums Board Hospitals. It is my duty to report the failure, for the fourth consecutive year, of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to admit into their hospitals certain of your parishioners suffering from scarlet fever and diphtheria. This deadlock has been brought about by the want of beds, and that again has been ascribed to the increase and prevalence of dangerous infectious diseases in London for some time past. It will be within the memory of your Vestry, that in July last, the Asylums Board Managers addressed their usual circular-letter to the Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities. In this letter it was suggested that in the selection of cases for removal to hospital, preference should be given to poor patients " who are obviously most in need of hospital treatment." This suggestion is in keeping with the object for which the hospitals were primarily built, namely, for the reception of the poor and needy. Care has been taken by your Medical Officer to make out and submit to the Central Authority a daily list of the more urgent infectious cases requiring hospital isolation. Notwithstanding this precaution, there is reason to suspect that cases which might have been fairly isolated at home have gained entry into the Asylums Hospitals, to the exclusion of members of families living in one or two rooms, often situated in large block buildings. The greatest number of cases refused admission on a single day during the two weeks under report, was seven, five of whom suffered from scarlet fever, and two from diphtheria. Of this number living with parents, brothers, and sisters, three dwelt in one room, two in two rooms, and two in three rooms. To-day there are four scarlet fever patients dwelling in large " models," all of whom it is impossible to isolate efficiently, save in a fever hospital. These cases have all been refused admission on more than one occasion. The remedies I would suggest towards ameliorating the present dangerous state of affairs is:— First, a more careful selection of cases by the Asylums Board. Secondly, the speedy erection on the sites already acquired, of increased accommodation to meet the requirements of the Sanitary Authorities. This Special Report gave rise to the following Correspondence:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 11th November, 1895. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 29th ultimo, transmitting a copy of the report presented by you to the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, upon the deficiency of accommodation for fever cases in the Metropolitan Asylums District Hospitals. The Board direct me to state that it will be convenient if you will furnish them with specific evidence, in support of the statementin thereport, that " there is reason to suspect that cases, which might have been fairly isolated at home, have gained entry into the Asylums Hospitals, to the exclusion of members of families living in one or two rooms, often situated in large block buildings." I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, S. B. PROVIS, Assistant Secretary, F. J. Waldo, Esq., M.D., Medical Officer of Health, 1, Plowden Buildings, Temple, E.C. 29 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. Vestry Hall, St. George's, Southwark, 15th March, 1895. Sir. In answer to your letter of the 11th inst., I beg to furnish the Local Government Board with the following specific evidence in support of the suspicion raised in my report. (For these cases, 9ee Page 31.) I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Asylums Board, London, W.C., 15th November, 1895. Dear Sir, I submitted to the Managers, at their last meeting, your letter of the 23rd ultimo, together with the enclosed report from Dr. Waldo, your Medical Officer of Health. Dr. Waldo refers therein to the arrangements suggested in the Managers' circular letters of the 11th July last, and states that he has taken care to make out the daily list of cases asked for. Dr. Waldo, however, for some time, overlooked the fact that the Managers asked in such letter that " a statement of the circumstances which render the removal of cases urgent," might be added to the list. Your Board must see that only by such means are the Managers enabled to judge of the priority which should be given to such cases inter se, and also in relation to the " urgent " cases reported by other parishes and unions. Recently, the requisite information has been given, and at the present time all "urgent" cases, for whose removal Dr. Waldo applied, have been admitted into hospital. With regard to Dr. Waldo's general complaint, " that cases which might have been fairly isolated at home" have been received "to the exclusion of members of families living in one or two rooms, often situated in large block buildings," I should be glad if he would furnish me with a specific list of such cases, in order that I may investigate this complaint. With regard to the suggested remedies contained in Dr. Waldo's report, I think the above explanation fully answers the first. As to the second, the Managers regret they cannot see their way to make immediate further accommodation to meet the exigencies of the moment, the accommodation in the present hospitals having been increased to the utmost possible limit compatible with safety. But the Managers have acquired, as your Board are aware, sites for three large, new permanent hospitals. One of these hospitals is nearing completion, the second is in course of erection, and the third will very shortly be begun. Yours faithfully, (Signed) T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk to the Board. A. Millar, Esq., Clerk to the Vestry of St. George's, Southwark. 30 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Dear Sir, The Metropolitan ASylums Board, London, W.C., 23rd December, 1895. I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult., and, in reply, I have to state that on the 28th ult. I forwarded to the Local Government Board an explanatory statement with regard to the admission of the cases to which you refer, and which I find are the same as set forth in your letter to the Local Government Board, dated the 15th ult., of which that Board forwarded me a copy on the 20th ult. I enclose, for your information, a copy of my letter to the Local Government Board. Yours faithfully, T. BUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk of the Board. Dr. Waldo, Medical Officer of Health, St. George's, Southwark. Metropolitan Asylums Board, Norfolk House, Strand, W.C., 28th November, 1895. Sir, I submitted to the Managers, at their meeting on the 23rd inst., the letter from the Local Government Board, dated the 20th inst. (No. 140,139a), with which the Board forwarded a copy of a letter addressed by the Board on the 11th inst. to Dr. Waldo, Medical Officer of Health of the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, together with a copy of his reply. In reply to the request of the Local Government Board to be furnished with the observations of the Managers upon the question raised in the correspondence, 1 have, in the first instance, to point out that the cases mentioned in Dr. Waldo's letter as affording "specific evidence in support of the suspicion raised" in his report of the 22nd ult. are cases of diphtheria only, and do not include any case of scarlet fever. Of these four cases of diphtheria, 1 find that one—viz., F......... L was conveyed to the South Eastern Hospital, in the private brougham of the medical practitioner, who had been called in to attend on the patient, and the superintendent of the hospital, in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon him by Article 4 of the Local Government Board Order, dated 10th February, 1875, admitted the patient. The remaining cases, the Local Government Board will observe from: the statements made in Dr. Waldo's letter of the 15th inst., were removed from the out-patient departments of general hospitals, and the officials of the Managers having no knowledge whatever of the social circumstances of the patients, gave directions for their admission into the Board's hospitals. I may add that no urgent case of diphtheria was excluded from the Board's hospitals as a consequence of the patients referred to. I have also to state, for the Local Government Board's information, that a copy of Dr. Waldo's report was forwarded to the Managers by the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, on the 23rd ult., and that on the 13th inst. I wrote to the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 31 Vestry asking to be furnished with a specific list of "cases which might have been fairly isolated at home, but have been received to the exclusion of numbers of families living in one or two rooms, often situated in a large block-buildings," but, up to the present time, I have not received any reply. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk to the Board. Vestry Hall, St. George's, Southwark, S.E., 29th November, 1895. Dear Sir, In answer to your courteous letter of the 15th inst., addressed to the Vestry Clerk of St. George's, Southwark, and handed to me for reply, I have to say :— First, with regard to cases which might have been isolated at home, and which apppeared to me to have been received to the exclusion of members of families living in one or two rooms, I append four fairly typical cases. If your Board cares to investigate, I need hardly say I should be happy to furnish all other details in my possession. I may add that my wish in bringing forward this matter was to further the interests of the parish, and in no way to add to the difficulties of the Asylums Board. Your assurance that the accommodation of the Board will be shortly increased by the addition of three large new permanent hospitals is most satisfactory, and will, no doubt, effectually do away with the need of any further complaints. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Signed) F. J. WALDO, M.D. T. Duncombe Mann, Esq., Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board. I.— F C , aged 4 years, ..., Southwark Bridge Road, notified as suffering from diphtheria, by Dr. W..., on 28th June, and removed, on his advice, to Guy's Hospital, from whence case was received into Asylums Board Hospital, on 29th June, 1895. II.— A C. , aged 6½ years, ..., Southwark Bridge Road, notified as suffering from diphtheria by Dr. W..., of ..., Rodney Road, S.E., and sent on his advice to Guy's Hospital, from whence patient was removed to Asylums Board Hospital on 7th July, 1895. N.B.—The above cases, I. and II., were removed from a house containing six large rooms, and occupied by one family. III.— V S , aged 6 years, ..., London Road (house with about eight rooms, and occupied by one family only), notified as suffering from diphtheria, at the " Golden Square Throat Hospital," by Dr. I , and removed to Asylums Board Hospital on 22nd September, 1895. N.B.—This case was sent to the Throat Hospital by the parents. IV.— F L , aged 17 years, ..., Old Kent Road (a house with 14 to 16 rooms, and occupied by a single family), notified as suffering from diphtheria by Dr. A of ..., Old Kent Road, and removed to South Eastern Asylums Board Hospital on 9th October, 1895.

Stations within or near the parish, containing litters and stretchers, and provided by the Street Ambulance Branch of the Hospitals Association, for the transfer of sick and injured persons (infectious cases excepted) are situated as follows :— Marshalsea Road, at the junction of Mint Street. Fire Brigade Head Quarters, Southwark Bridge Road. Fire Brigade Station, Waterloo Road. St. Thomas's Hospital. Guy's Hospital, Southwark. All metropolitan patients suffering from small-pox, fevers, and diphtheria, may, on application, be conveyed to and fro, and treated free, within the isolaton hospitals of the Asylum Board. The Ambulance Station nearest the parish is the South-Eastern one, situate at the New Cross Road (near Old Kent Road Railway Station), S.E. Telephonic communication can be made from the Health Department (within office hours), to the chief office of the Asylums Board, and within a few minutes an ambulance will be on its way, for the conveyance of the patient to the South-Eastern Hospital (adjoining the South-Eastern Ambulance Station), if sufferiug from fever or diphtheria; or to the South Wharf, at Rotherhithe, if it be a case of small-pox. In the latter case, the patient will embark in one of the ambulance steamers for the hospital ships at Long Reach. The Convalescent Hospitals, belonging to the Asylums Board, are two in number. That for fevers and diphtheria is situated at Winchmore Hill, in the North-East of London; that for small-pox at Gore Farm, Darenth, distant about four miles from the hospital ships. Patients in a position to bear the expense of their support, and suffering from fevers and diphtheria, or small-pox, can be accommodated at the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington, and at the Highgate Small pox Hospital, respectively. Report on Suggested Incinerator. I have on more than one occasion pointed out to your Sanitary Authority the fact that Section 59 of the Public Health (London) Act requires "the provision of proper premises, with all necessary apparatus for the destruction of infected articles," such as bedding and clothing. In this poor parish foul and infected articles have to be burnt, either in the furnace of the new steam disinfector, or, in the case of bedding, in a heap on the ground at the Vestry's Stone Yard This process is at least an unsatisfactory one, and in the event of an outbreak— say of small-pox or cholera—infected goods would assuredly accumulate, and the disease be probably spread before a safe method of disposal could be arranged. I, therefore, advise your Vestry, without further delay, to tender for a properly contracted Incinerator, which might usefully be erected near the disinfector in the parish Stone Yard. ****** Since presenting the above report, it will be within the memory of your Vestry that a contract has been entered into with the authorities of Guy's Hospital for the use of their Incinerator. £20 per annum is the amount stipulated as the price to be paid for burning disinfected articles. During the past year 13 such lots of bedding have been destroyed in the Guy's Incinerator. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 33 Environment and Drink.* In the present year of grace there is happily no need to enlarge upon the evils of alcoholic intemperance. It may be at once assumed that such indulgence entails disaster upon the individual no less than upon the family and the nation. For all that, the underlying causes of inebriety are but ill understood, although of late years a flood of light has been thrown upon their inwardness by many earnest workers. Among recent advances none is likely to be of more practical value than that which recognizes alcoholism as pointing to some mental flaw in the individual. To the medical man a "symptom" is merely the evidence of a more remote disorder. Thus, a red and inflamed skin may be symptomatic of scarlet fever, of parasites, of measles, of sunburn, and of a host of more or less sharply defined and definable causes. In a similar way the craving for strong drink may be regarded as a symptom of varied origin. That it may be the token of an inherited mental instability is now generally acknowledged. When, however, it results from acquired brain conditions little appears to be known as to its causation. In the matter of drink, as in other ways, the individual responds to the influences of his environment. Thus, bad surroundings may convert a man of seemingly sound mental and bodily constitution into a drunkard. On the other hand, a good environment may to a great extent neutralise the effects of even a large and long continued consumption of alcohol. Take, for instance, the case of a country squire well off in such things as food, clothes, housing, and open air exercise. He may consume a large quantity of strong drink every day of his life, and yet live to a hale and hearty old age. A poor man in a bad environment who drank to a similar extent would probably never reach forty. In the first case, it should be noted, the special circumstances imply good liquor, whereas in the second they mean drink of an inferior and highly injurious nature. Then a bad environment acts in many ways as a direct physiological incentive to the use of alcohol. In most instances it sooner or later lessens the moral control of the individual by damaging his brain, the nutrition of which is sensitive to changes in the blood and circulation. By enfeebling the body generally, and the heart in particular, it leads the individual, naturally enough, to seek relief from the stimulant that lies nearest to his hand. Environment is, of course, a wide term, and includes such circumstances as occupation, habitat, worldly gear, in short, all the immediate externals of the individual. The circumstances of town life are more harmful to mankind than those of the country, as shown by a comparison of the death rates of the one and the other. If we compare the mortality of the rustic labourer with that of the. corresponding class in London we find that the countryman enjoys a life on an average three times as long as that of his metropolitan brethren. Much of this disparity may be accounted for by the fact that labour competition is keener in the towns, and hence there is a greater amount of poverty and privation. Among other causes are the smoky atmosphere and the general dissipation of town life, as against the simple habits and pure air of the country. Town mortality is further influenced by such points of special environment as bad drainage and unhealthy employments, but it may be questioned if, after all, the great determining factor of its havoc among adults may not be ascribed to alcohol. It need hardly be pointed out that all comparative figures of class mortalities bristle with fallacies. Thus, certain rich London districts, such as Hampstead, with a death-rate of 14.6 per 1.000 of population, and Plumstead, with 164 per 1,000, compare favourably with many rural districts, and dilute, as it were, the returns for the whole metropolis. Then, again, the towns are recruited by a steady stream of robust country folk. The urban child mortality, moreover, is about twice that of the rural. Taking such things into consideration, it is likely that the brunt of the total mortality of Great Britain falls upon the town poor. * Reprint of Article in the October Number of the North American Review, by F. J. Waldo, M.D., and David Walsh, M.B. 34 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The question of occupation closely effects the death rate of the labouring classes. The statistics of trade mortalities, however, do not give much help upon the point. The census is meagre in details, and is taken at too long intervals. Of the workmen, many desert an unhealthy trade and drift off to swell the mortality of some other occupation; while not a lew die in workhouses and other institutions, and leave no record of the particular trade that has broken their health. One may, however, attempt to arrive at a few broad tentative conclusions. In a table by Drs. Ogle and Arlidge, comparing the mortality between persons of various occupations, we find the fifteen highest on the list :— Occupation. Mean Annual Death. rate per 1,000 living. Comparative mortality figure, 1,000 Age. 25.45. Age. 45.65. Age. 25.65.

First, they belong to the working class, with the single exception of the licensed victuallers and innkeepers. Secondly, they are in the main urban. Moreover, seven of them, that is to say, the general labourers, costermongers and Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 35 hawkers, watchmen and messengers, cabmen and omnibusmen, musicians, bargemen and watermen, carters and carriers, are engaged in outdoor work that is arduous, prolonged, and often ill-paid and unhealthy. Is it any wonder that men working under such conditions should turn for solace to alcohol? As a matter of fact nearly all of them drink to excess. We see, then, that the fifteen highest trade mortalities fall for the most part upon the town labourers, who are given to drink, and whose work is of a toilsome and exacting nature. Of course, among them are many persons of deficient bodily and mental development, who earn their bread in the unskilled labour market of the cities. In the case of the Cornish miners, countrymen of strong frames and temperate habits, the high mortality is due to the poisonous dust and the bad ventilation of the mines. Turning to the fifteen occupations of lowest mortality, we find that four of them, namely, fishing, agricultural labour, farming and grazing, and gardening, are carried on in the open air and away from towns. The rest are partly urban and partly rural or mixed. Some of them, such as the legal and the clerical professions, appear to enjoy a specially favourable environment. On the whole, it may be said that the fifteen callings of lowest mortality are to a great extent rural, and include many well-to-do persons in town and country, while those of the highest fifteen are mainly urban, and, with the single exception of the publicans, belong to the working classes. The majority of those included in the fifteen lowest mortalities either work in the open air or spend a good deal of time out of doors, so that it seems clear that the hardship of out-door work cannot in itself be a chief factor of the high death-rate among town labourers. We must look for some other explanation of that excessive rate. That alcohol has a share in the untoward result it is hardly possible to doubt. Some such relation of cause and effect may be traced in the following table : Occupation. Mean Annual Deathrate per 1,000 living. Comparative mortality figure, 1,000 Age. 25.45 Age. 45.65 Age. 25.65 Barristers and solicitors 7.54 23.13 842 Law clerks 10.77 30.79 1,151 This startling disproportion may be accounted for in great part by the three following factors:—1. That law clerks lead less regular lives and drink more than their masters (and worse liquor). 2. That they live in cheaper and less healthv houses, and work in smaller and less wholesome offices. 3. That they are drawn from a class, often degenerate town-dwellers, less sound in mind and body than the middle class which supplies their employers. Conditions of a similar kind apply more or less to all the fifteen occupations of highest mortality. So far as the towns are concerned, bad housing is probably to a great extent due to modern systems of drainage, which are often grossly defective. In rural districts, where no general house drainage exists, this particular risk will be avoided. Other defects, such as want of ventilation, dampness, deficient cubic space, are common both to town and to country. The factor of faulty drainage applies to workshops as well as to houses. Broadly, it may be said to cause much bodily weakness, and, like bad ventilation, to predispose not only to chronic ill health, but also to occasional acute disease. From a physiological point of view it seems perfectly natural that any one living under bad 36 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. surroundings of the kind should fly to alcohol for relief. Take the case of a town labourer going out to his work after a night spent in an unwholesome dwelling. Suppose him to change one bad environment for another in the shape of a workshop that is overcrowded, ill.ventilated and polluted by sewer gas ? No wonder that a man passing his life under such depressing conditions should become weakened in mind and body, and crave for drink to stimulate his flagging heart and overtaxed energies. That this picture is not altogether imaginary may be gathered from the following considerations:—First, the proper sanitary supervision of dwellings, especially of the poorer class, is yet in its infancy, aud, indeed, must remain so until our system of inspection is rendered more thorough, skilled and systematic. Secondly, the defective conditions under which workshop labour is often conducted in our towns is plainly shown by the evidence given before the Lords' Commission upon sweating, and also by the reports of medical officers of health all over the country. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise while the present local staffs of sanitary inspectors are inadequate even for the discharge of routine duties, to say nothing of the impossibility of a house to house inspection of places that contain domestic workshops. If, on the other hand, the town labourer follow an outdoor occupation, his life still appears to be much shortened as compared with a corresponding class in the country. Thus, among the fifteen trades of heaviest mortality, we find:— Occupation. Mean Annual Death. rate per 1,000 living. Comparative mortality figure, 1,000 Age. 25.45 Age. 45.65 Age. 25.65 General labourers in London 20.62 50.85 2,020 Costermongers and hawkers 20.26 45.33 1,879 Watchmen, porters and messengers 17.07 37.37 1,565 Cabmen and omnibusmen 15.30 36.83 1,482. Professional musicians 13.78 32.39 1,314 Carters and carriers 12.52 23.00 1,275 Although those who work at the foregoing occupations escape the danger of unwholesome workshops, they are nevertheless exposed to the environment of an unhealthy home at night, They share certain bad conditions in common with the countryman, such as long hours of labour, arduous toil and constant exposure to the stress of weather. They do not share alcohol to an equal extent, and there can be no doubt that strong drink is one of the most potent factors in shortening the life of the town labourer. An interesting illustration of the effect of drinking habits upon mortality may be drawn from the following table:— Comparative mortality figure 1,000. Occupation. Age. 25.65 1. Cabmen and omnibusmen 14.82 2. Carters and carriers 12.75 3. Grooms and private coachmen 8.87 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 37 Workers in the first two classes, which have relatively a much greater death-rate, are notoriously heavy drinkers. They stop at many public houses in the course of their daily rounds, and they receive many offers of drink. Moreover, although their work is out-door it is to a great extent sedentary, and exposure under those conditions throws such a strain upon the circulation that it is perfectly natural they should seek a physiological restorative in the shape of a pleasant cardiac stimulant. Next compare the mortality of these two classes with that of the private grooms and coachmen, who work under almost similar conditions as to exposure, but who have shorter hours and less opportunity of indulging in alcohol, Indeed, it is obvious that heavy drinking habits would soon throw them out of employment. We find that their mortality is far less than that of the carters and carriers, and again than that of the cabmen and omnibusmen. It cannot be argued that the higher death-rate of the two last-named classes is due altogether to their greater consumption of alcohol. They are handicapped by longer hours of work, and they suffer in consequence to a much greater extent than private servants from rheumatism and other diseases due to exposure. In this bird's-eye view of the relation of environment to drink the chief aim has been to map out a few of the more striking outlines. The following broad statements may be appended in the hope that they may have a suggestive value to future workers:— 1. An excessive mortality prevails among the working population of towns as compared with (a) that of country labourers, or (b) of mixed classes in the wealthier urban districts. 2. The town mortality is swelled by an excessive infantile death-rate, and by the dusty and otherwise injurious trades carried on in crowded centres. 3. Overcrowding is rife in towns, especially in manufacturing districts. 4. Many town occupations are unskilled and attract men of inferior stamp. 5. Urban labour competition is keener than rural, with consequent increase of poverty and starvation. 6. Alcohol is consumed in larger quantity in towns, in part, possibly because of the greater temptations to indulgence. It is also taken freely in the fifteen occupations that have the highest death rates. 7. Systematic house drainage, with its attendannt risks, is in the main a distinctive feature of towns. Or, to put the matter in a different form: A. The stress of preventable mortality falls on the infantile and working population of our great towns. B. The conditions more or less peculiar to the town labourer are (a) the temptation to indulge in alcohol, (b) trade dangers, (c) bad drains. A Short Summary and Report of Proceedings in relation to Proposed Visits by the Officer of Health to Sick Employes of the Vestry. When I had the honour of being appointed as Medical Officer of Health to St. George's, I agreed to obey the Order under the Public Health (London) Act relating to the duties of Medical Officers of Health. At the same time I consented to carry out a certain additional duty:—namely, "to attend, if required, the sewermen,flushers, and employes during sickness." This agreement I signed on the strengh of the understanding that the particular duty had received the sanction of the Local Government Board. I was requested later on to visit several sick employes of the Vestry without the knowledge of their medical attendants. This I respectfully declined to 38 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. do for reasons fully explained to the Vestry. On the general question of attendance upon patients by me, as Medical Officer, I advanced the three following objections :— (1) My unfitness for this work, as I have given up active practice for many years. (2) Loss of time from regular duties. (3) Friction with the medical men of the district who were attending the patients in question. The Vestry then applied to the Local Government Board for a decision, and obtained the following reply :— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 12th June, 1895. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the duty undertaken by Dr. F. J. Waldo, the Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, " to attend, if required, the flushers and sewersmen, and. other employes of the Vestry during illness," and requesting the Board's advice and guidance in the difficulty which has arisen in regard thereto. The Board have carefully considered the representations on the subject submitted in your letter, and in the report of Dr. Waldo, which accompanied it. On the general question, the Board would observe that as regards duties of a somewhat analagous character which at times devolve on the Medical Officer of Health under the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, they have laid it down that even when questions arise as to the good faith of a certifying medical practitioner, the Medical Officer of Health should, if it becomes necessary to revise a certificate, not only seek the co-operation of the medical practitioner concerned, but should also observe, as far as possible, the customs that usually govern the relations of medical practitioners to each other. On the particular case submitted in your letter of the 23rd ultimo, the Board do not gather that the undertaking entered into by Dr. Waldo, "to attend, if required, "on certain employes during illness," involves an obligation on his part to revise either the diagnoses or the certificate granted by other medical practitioners, who have been called in "to attend " on such persons. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) D. E. KNOLLYS. A. Millar Esq., Vestry Clerk, St. George the Martyr, Southwark. It was then decided by the Vestry to record the letter on the Minutes, and the matter has since dropped. Underground Workshops.* The general tendency of civilised communities is to flock towards particular centres of population. In order to make the most of costly ground, the builder tries to gain in height what he lacks in breadth. Hence we see huge blocks of buildings springing up on all sides. These lofty rows of houses, often on the sides of narrow streets, prevent the circulation of air and the entrance of sunlight. In order to obviate this particular danger the London Building Act of 1894 restricted the height of houses in the metropolis to a maximum of 80 feet, and laid down certain definite relations to be observed between the height of the houses and the width of the streets on which A joint Paper by Drs. Waldo and Walsh, read before the British Medical Association at the Annual Meeting, held in London in July, 1895. Beprinted from the British Medical Journal 31st August, 1895. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 39 they abut. This Act does not apply to the City proper, for reasons that will be fairly obvious. Nor does it touch an opposite danger, which is a further outcome of the excessive value of town lands. The builders, not content with soaring skywards, have taken to burrowing in the earth, so that we find London basement rooms used as workshops, being two or even three floors beneath the level of the street. An "underground workshop" may be defined as "any workshop almost or wholly below the adjoining street or surface level." This definition includes basements the roofs of which are raised several feet—say, two or three—above the neighbouring ground level. Our attention has been drawn to the subject of underground workshops generally by an investigation of the bakeries carried on in London basement rooms. The majority of these places, especially in the older houses, are nothing more or less than cellars. The process of conversion from the cellar to the bakehouse is simple. The baker rents a house in a business thoroughfare, furnishes the cellar with a few gas jets, some kneading troughs, a water tap, and a furnace, and he is forthwith the possessor of a bakehouse. From cellars of this type, on a moderate estimate, more than one half of the daily bread of Londoners is issued. The bakers have hitherto made light of the evils of their underground workshops. For a long time they contended that however bad the bakehouse no harm could result to the consumer, as the process of baking sterilized the loaf. The fallacy of that assumption has been shown by the present writers, who cultivated numerous bacteria from the centre of newly baked London loaves. In the particular case of the underground workshops used for the making of bread, we hold that their use, under present conditions, involves distinct danger to the public safety, as regards both consumer and 40 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. producer. We may add that the view as to the possible spread of disease by means of bread has been widely adopted in India, where several outbreaks of typhoid fever i have been ascribed to bread baked in the native bazaars. Tn London, and no doubt to a lesser extent in most of the large towns throughout the kingdom, there are many basement rooms used as workplaces that are unfit for the purpose. Indeed, for the most part, as in the case of the underground bakeries, they are simply cellars that have been utilised for the housing of workmen. Such adapted cellars are almost always low, damp, airless, and liable to drain and sewer pollution. Nor can these defects, in the absence of proper statutory powers, be remedied by the medical officer of health. The most he can do is to check the grosser defects in the rare instances in which they are brought under his official notice. Until a rigid system of house-to- house visitation is the rule it seems likely that ninety-nine out of a hundred underground workshops will escape any sanitary control whatever. In the present state of the law it is only when the underground room- is'used as a sleeping place that the medical officor of health is vested with any efficient powers, Even then the law is evaded. The statute applies only to underground places that are let separately for use as dwellings. The tenant, accordingly, has simply to rent a room in the upper part of tho house to escape the condition of separate occupation of the basement. By thus renting an upstairs room a baker may actually sleep in the basement with his family alongside of his bakery, and sua}) his fingers at the law. In tho course of our investigations into the facts of the underground bakeries the question naturally arose—Can an ordinary cella1' basement be converted into a healthy workshop? Or to put tho matter into other words—Can the downstairs chamber of a dwelling house, almost or altogether underground and with no outside area or proper r windows, bo made struotually fit for the occupation of workmen? This question, after careful consideration, wo believe can be answered in the affirmative. To convert an ordinary cellar into a wholesome workshop, however, requires no little structural alteration. Such a task, in our opinion, can be performed only by the observance of certain essentials, first among which may be placed the provision of an outside open area. The difficulty of getting room for such an area in streets where the houses abut on the pavement is on doubt great. We believe, however, that it can be in most instances surmounted by throwing back the front of the shop and borrowing, g so to speak, space for the area from beneath the upper overhanging portion of the house. Of this " borrowed area" we shall speak more in detail later on. The vital points of construction to be provided for are : 1. Cubic Space and Height.—The height of the workshop should be at least 8 feet from floor to ceiling. In altering premises this measurement may be attained, if: necessary, by deepening existing levels and by underpinning the foundations. As to Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 41 cubic space, a minimum of 500 cubic feet should be provided for each workman. At the same time additional space must be allowed where gas or other artificial luminant, except electricity, is used. 2. Structure of Walls and Ceiling.— The walls should be smooth, dry, nonabsorbent, and made of some material that can be easily washed. These conditions may be satisfied by the use of a good lining cement, or, better, of glazed bricks or tiles. Whitewash over brick or plaster is undesirable, as it soon gets dirty, has a rough surface, and cannot be properly cleansed. The walls should be furnished with a dampproof course below the floor level, and if such a course does not already exist it must be inserted, if necessary, by deepening and underpinning the foundations. If the basement walls be unprotected by an area or by adjoining buildings, they must be shielded against damp in one of the following ways (a) by making an outside area, (b) by constructing a hollow space in the centre of the wall, or (c) by building a second wall outside, so as to prevent the soil coming into contact with the main wall of the basement. Without these precautions it would be impossible to prevent dampness, eepecially where the building is of porous brick. The ceiling should be lined with plaster, with tongued matchboarding, or with a smooth glazed material that can be periodically cleansed. 3. Window Space.— Where a front and back outside area already exist there will be no difficulty in providing ample window space ; indeed, that part of the workshop facing the area can be converted practically into one large window. Where there is no outside area there is no satisfactory way of getting room for windows except by the unsatisfactory expedient of digging a space down in front of the window itself. In all cases the windows should reach to the ceiling, and be made to open flapwise in their upper halves ; they should be placed at each end, or on two sides of the basement, whether the latter be an open chamber or divided off by cross partitions. The total window surface should be equal to one-eighth of the floor area. 4. Light and Ventilation.— These must be to a certain extent regulated by the special conditions of each case. An open outside area and ample window space are great aids to natural light and ventilation. Artificial ventilating inlets may be furnished by Tobin's tubes, by perforated bricks, by louvred panes, and by other well-known methods. In dusty situations they must be guarded by filters of wire, of gauze, or of other suitable material. In an underground chamber the outlet often presents a good deal of difficulty. The most usual way is by an exhaust shaft, the draught of which is created by waste heat from the furnaces. by lighted gas burners, by a steam jet, or by a mechanically driven fan. An open fireplace and chimney should be provided in every basement room intended for human occupation, whether by day or by night. The difficulty of getting good ventilation will be, of course, much increased if the builder descend to a second or third downstair floor. 5. Light.— Artificial light is best obtained from electric lamps, which do not unduly warm and foul the air. Where gas is used, an extra allowance of air space should be made, each burner counting as three adults. The amount of day and sunlight will depend very much on the size of the outside area and of the window space. 6. The Floor.— This should be made of good concrete, at least 9 inches thick. Its surface should be of smooth cement, of glazed brick tiles, or of tesselated paving. On no account must any gully or sink connected with a drain open through the floor. 7. Drainage and Lavatory Accommodation should be ample, especially in cases where food is prepared. Waterclosets should be of good modern type, supplied with automatic flushing tanks and wash-out pans. They should be placed away from the workshop, if possible, in the area. As the ventilating air for the basement passes through the area, it will be well to cut off connection with closets as much as possible, and to provide them with a separate system of ventilation. Washing accommodation should in all cases be provided. If any drains pass under the basement, they should be encased in 6 inches of concrete, and laid at least a foot below the concrete floor, and 42 Parish, of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. their joints made gastight with Portland cement. Better still, the pipes may he of iron, prepared by the Barff process, or lined with Angus Smith's solution; such pipes should be laid on concrete, and cemented at the joints. 8. Water Supply should come from the rising main. If that cannot be arranged, owing to the absence of a constant service, separate cisterns must be provided for drinking and for closet purposes, such cisterns to be of approved modern type. 9. The " Borroived Area."— In cases where the front of the house runs up flush with the pavement, we suggest that space can be got for an outside area in the following way :—The front of the shop is to be thrown back some 5 or 6 feet, and an area sunk in the space borrowed in this way from the main overhanging building. The outside area is thus gained at the expense of a part of the shop and the basement. The size of the shop is somewhat lessened by the alteration, but by way of makeweight the basement is converted into a light and habitable room. Access to the shop is provided by a bridge crossing the new area from the pavement. The area we regard as absolutely essential to the construction of a healthy basement workshop. A proper supply of air and light, to say nothing of the disconnection of lavatory arrangements, can hardly be obtained in the absence of an outside open area of fair size. Further, if the whole of the basement is to be used for workmen, we think that an area should exist on more than one side of the basement. We would suggest, therefore, that every basement room meant for use as a workshop should have an outside area along its entire frontage, that the said area be properly drained and paved, be at least 4 feet in width in all parts, and extend to 6 inches or more below the floor level. We would also make a second area compulsory in every basement workshop. The second area, which might be placed at the side of the basement in some cases, should be of similar construction to the front one, except that it may be 3 feet wide in all parts. In the case of basements having 2 feet or more of their height above the level of the adjoining surface, the width of the front area might also be reduced to 3 feet. It need hardly be pointed out that absolute precautions must be taken to prevent any access to the area of sewage or other contamination. It is equally clear that open ashpits must not be allowed in the area. All refuse should be kept in covered galvanised iron bins, which should be systematically emptied and cleansed. The Public Health Act of 1875 made it illegal for any cellar built or rebuilt since 1848 to be separately occupied as a dwelling, nor any cellar whatever, unless it complies with the following requirements :— (a) The height must be in every part at least 7 feet, 3 feet of which must be above the level of the adjoining street; (b) an open area, at least 2½ feet wide in every part and 6 inches below the level of the floor, must extend along the whole frontage. It may be crossed by steps, but not opposite the window; (c) the cellar must be drained by a drain at least 1 foot below the floor; (d) there must be proper closet and ash-pit accommodation; (e) there must be a fireplace and chimney; and (f) a window at least 9 square feet in area, made to open. The window of a back cellar, let or occupied along with the front cellar, need only be 4 square feet in area. With certain modifications we have applied the foregoing regulations as to cellar dwellings to cellar workshops. The chief points of difference are that we ask for 8 feet in room height instead of 7 ; for an open outside front area 4 feet instead of 3 ; and for an additional area of less width along one of the sides or the back of the basement. The main practical difficulty in the way of satisfying these requirements would no doubt be in making an area in town houses. In order to meet this objection we have devised the scheme of the "borrowed area, "whereby an open area can be obtained for a house even if situated in the narrowest street of London. The main conclusion of this paper is, then, that an underground or basement room can be converted into a healthy workshop by a proper expenditure of money in structural alterations, whereby the basement may be rendered dry, light and airy. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 43 Correspondence re Cellar Bakeries. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Vestry Hall, St. George the Martyr, Southwark, January 17th, 1895. Rt. Hon. Sir, The Sanitary Authority of St. George, Southwark, has instructed me to address this letter to the Home Office as the Supreme Executive entrusted with the carrying out of the Factory and Workshop Acts. During the past two-and-a-half years St. George's has had, and still has, considerable difficulty in construing their legal powers and duties in regard to retail bakehouses. This uncertainty is in great part due to the obscure wording and lengthiness of the three Acts of Parliament in which the whole of the Factory and Workshop law of. the country has been consolidated. These Acts contain 160 sections and eight voluminous schedules. The St. George's Local Authority, however, has not been lacking in zeal in its attempt to perform a thankless and difficult duty. Its attitude may be gathered from the fact that within the last eighteen months I have been instructed, as Medical Officer, to take action against nine occupiers of retail bakeries, under Section 16 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883. In all these cases the Authority was of opinion that the premises were on sanitary grounds unfit for use as bakehouses. Brief particulars of the cases, with results, are given in the following table:— 44 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwork. Cask Situation. Result. Present Condition. Remarks. 1. Completely underground, beneath shop and living l-ooom Fined 40/- and 2/- costs. Gross defects remedied, structure rendered less unsafe and slightly improved Structure bad, overcrowded, inefficient ventilation, and otherwise unfitted for use. Depth of cellar recently increased 6 inches by excavation. Two bakehouses on same level communicating. Both small. Pastry made in front, bread in back cellar. No area. 2. Completely underground, beneath shop and living room Fined fullpenaly of 40/- and 23/costs, after one adjournment. Gross defects remedied, ventilation and w.c. somewhat improved Ventilation unsatisfactory, drain opening in floor, dark, abuts on street. No back yard or area. Cellar started as bakehouse in 1817. 3. Underground: Roof below level of street— beneath shop and living room Shutters up on arrival of Inspector with official notice Still closed. Occupier remarked that he "felt a breeze "after his last interview with the Medical Officer, and so thought it best to shut up shop. 4. Underground: Roof below level of street—beneath shop and living room After three adjournments occupier agreed to discontinue for purposes of baking. Ordered to pay 2'- costs Now in use as restaurant kitchen Cellar old and delapidated. Two w.c.'s adjacent, insufficient ventilation, and otherwise unfitted for use. 5. Completely underground, Roof forms floor to archway entry to "model" dwelling, to shop, and to bed and sitting room Case, after one adjournment, withdrawn, by consent, on occupier promising to close, and pay 2/- costs. Gross defects removed on service of notice. Recently enlarged and re-opened. Match boarding partition separating from cellar, formerly used as bedroom, having been removed. Still dark and badly ventilated, abuts directly on street, drainopening communicating with sewer. No area. Temporarily closed. First used as bakehouse in 1882. * 6. Completely underground, beneath shop and living room Fined full penalty of 40/- and 2/costs. Gross defects remedied, structural faults irremovable. Still closed. On the service of a second official notice bakehouse was closed. 7. Completely underground, beneath shop and living room Fined 20/- and 2/- costs. Gross defects remedied, structure improved by owner. Much improved, but still unsatisfactory. In summer, when wind is from a certain quarter, this small bakehouse is infested by flies from a neighbouring knacker's yard, where glandered flesh may often be seen exposed. Query:—Does baking sterilize bread ? 8. This case is still pending. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 45 Official proceedings have already been taken against the occupiers of eight out of a total of 23 cellar bakeries in St. George's. Of this number only three remain closed at the time of writing. Efficient ventilation and natural lighting of these underground bakeries seems to be impracticable. These and other serious evils arise chiefly from defects of a structural character. In the absence of any uniform, official, or statutory standard by which the Sanitary Authority may be guided, none of the above-mentioned bakehouses are at the present time, in my judgment, in a fit condition for the preparation of bread or pastry. Case number 1 in the Table has been reported by me as still unfit for use or occupancy as a bakehouse.* Although the prosecution has been the means of remedying the grosser defects, yet structural ones of a serious character still exist. The Authority of St. George's, however, has not yet instituted further legal proceedings, the tenant occupier having already done all in his power to structurally improve the owner's bakehouse. Since the Factory and Workshop Acts only admit of the Sanitary Authority prosecuting the occupier, who is often without sufficient means (as in Case 1) to remedy structural defects, the St. George's Authority would be grateful if the Home Office would be so good as to enlighten them on the following specific points :— Whether or no St. George's, as the Local Sanitary Authority, can take action as regards unwholesome retail bakehouses structurally unfit for use as such. 1. By applying for Closing Order against the owner under Sect. 3, Sect. 4.— (3), and Sect. 5.—(7) of the Public Health (Lond.) Act, 1891. Query—Will the words under Sect. 2 "as far as practicable " preclude successful action being taken in case of where efficient ventilation is impossible, owing to structural faults that cannot be remedied ? Again, under Sect. 5, the phrase occurs, " by reason of a nuisance a dwellinghouse is unfit for human habitation." Does the expression "dwelling-house," coupled with the term "unfit for human habitation," include retail bakehouses, unfit on sanitary grounds, for use or occupancy as such ? 2. Whether or no a Closing Order may be obtained under Sect. 5, in the case of an underground bakehouse, where it cannot be sworn by the Medical Officer that there is danger to health in any dwelling-room belonging to and forming part of the same house wherein the said bakehouse is situated? 3. If, in addition to prosecution as above, under heading 1., against the owner, whether or no action can at the same time be taken under the same Statute against the occupier for abatement, and Prohibition Orders—re nuisance—under:— (a) Sect. 2, 3, 4 and 5 or Sect. 26 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Or under another Statute, e.g.:— (b) Sects. 34, 35, and 81 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878 ; or (c) Sects. 15 and 16 Factory and Workshop Act, 1883. *Two men and two youths continue to bake bread and pastry, by means of two ovens, in this cellar. 46 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. In conclusion, the Authority of St. George's will feel much obliged for a solution of the issues raised in this communication, as well as for any advice as to the most equitable manner of proceeding in the future, with a view to the protection of the health of the public and of the workmen, by the permanent closure (if possible) of existing unwholesome bakeries within this district. In excuse for the length of this letter, I can only urge the importance of the subject, and the difficulty of explaining the doubts at present existing in the minds of the Authority, without going into some detail. I have the honour to be, Eight Honourable Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The Rt. Hon. Herbert H. Asquith, Q.C,, M.P., Principal Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. Whitehall, 26th July, 1995. Sir, With reference to your letter on the 17th January last, calling attention to the difficulty experienced by St. George's Vestry in dealing with certain underground retail bakehouse, which are unfit for use or occupation as such, by reason of structural defects, that it is found impossible to remedy, I am directed by the Secretary of State to acquaint you that he has communicated with the Local Government Board on the possibility of instituting proceedings, as suggested by you under Sections 2, 4 and 5 of the Public Health (London) Act. 1891; and that the Board has expressed the opinion that, a bakehouse as such cannot be considered to be a dwelling house, within the meaning of Section 5, or a dwelling house, which includes a bakehouse, to be unfit for human habitation within the meaning of the same Section by reason of the premises being unfit for use as a bakehouse, and that, in consequence, closing orders under the sections referred to could not be obtained in the cases mentioned. Proceedings can be instituted under Section 2 (1) of that Act for overcrowding in the case of a bakehouse which is not a Factory,' subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, and are to be taken against the person by whose act, default, or sufferance, the nuisance arises or continues. The Secretary of State agrees with the opinion expressed by the Local Government Board, and is not aware of any means, except by proceedings under Section 16 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, by which the Local Authority can prevent the use as bakehouses of rooms which cannot be made fit, from a sanitary point of view for use as such. Proceedings under that Section, however, and under Section 34 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1883 (which Section will on the 1st January 1896, become applicable by the Factory and Workshop Act of the last Session of Parliament to all bakehouses), can be taken against the person who lets, as well as the person who occupies. The Secretary of State would call attention to the provisions in Section 27 (3) of the Factory and Workshop Act of last Session, which comes into force on the 1st of January next. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, KENELM E. DIGBY. F. J. Waldo, Esq., M.D., 1, Plowden Buildings, Temple, E.C. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 47 Being in doubt as to the exact meaning of the last-mentioned sub-section, I wrote to the Home Office, asking them kindly to furnish me with 1.—A definition of an underground bakehouse. 2.—Information as to whether or no, in the case of an underground bakehouse in use, say in January, 1895, closed in December, 1895, and re-opened on 1st January, 1896, the same could be legally occupied on or after the last-mentioned date. In reply to these questions the following letter has been received by me :— Whitehall, 10th February, 1896. Sir, In reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo, respecting underground bakehouses, I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that whether a place was or was not "used as a bakehouse " at the commencement of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, is a question of fact to be determined in each case on consideration of all the circumstances. Temporary closing does not necessarily constitute disuse. In the same way the question whether a bakehouse is underground is a question of fact, which has to be considered in each case on its merits. No precise measurements have been laid down by the Act. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, HENEY CUNYNGHAME. F. J.

Report on Proposed Reception House. On the 24th inst. I attended the meeting, convened by the General Purposes Committee, at which the Chairman and two members from the Works and Public Health Committee, respectively, were present. This meeting was to consider the question as to leasing land adjacent to the Parish Stone Yard in King James' Street, also, with regard to this land, to decide as to the instructions to be given your Surveyor for the preparation of plans prior to the proposed building on that site of a reception house. With a view to making the matter clear to the members of your Vestry, I will repeat the actual words of the 60th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. They are as follows :— "The Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation, with any necessary attendants for the member of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for tho purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority." The suggested site is, in my opinion, an excellent one, and well fitted in every respect for the purpose of a temporary shelter, sometimes called a " reception " or "refuge "house. The new steam disinfector in the Stone Yard directly faces the proposed site on which a Reception House—with entry separate from the yard, and opening into the street—might well be built. With regard to the size of the house, after carefully taking into account the needs of the district, I should advise that a minimum of eight rooms, besides bathroom be provided. This number might be increased later on, if wanted. Additional accommodation is needed for a caretaker and his wife. The following table gives details of such tenements, with the names of the commoner infectious diseases for the period between 1st of June, 1892, and 31st of December, 1895:— 49 Annual Report of the- Medical Officer of Health—1895.

However, it puts on record the fact that during the past 3½ years 778 infected tenements, occupied by 3,310 infected persons, have not been disinfected. In other words, apart from dwellings, 3,310 centres of infection have been permitted to continue a danger, not only to themselves, but to their fellow citizens throughout the metropolis. For further information, if needed, I would refer new members of the Vestry to two exhaustive special reports "on a Proposed Reception House" printed in full, in the Vestry's Report for 1892-3, from which the following may be quoted :— " Since there is so much overcrowding and poverty with its accompanying disease, ignorance, and filth, I think no one can gainsay that this district is, of all others, the one where a Reception House is needed. "I am aware that our high poor-rate presses heavily on the rate-payers, and it is only after careful consideration that I have determined upon making the present report. I believe, however, that a Reception House will ultimately prove the means of lowering rather than of raising the rates, by keeping people out of the Workhouse and Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. "It will certainly prevent many deaths and more sickness, misery and broken health. It will facilitate the removal of mothers into the hospitals, and give time to the bread-winner to provide for his children.'' Since writing the above, an Act of Parliament, in my opinion a wise one—at least, so far as the public health is concerned, has been enacted. I refer to the (London) Equalisation of Rates Act, 1894, which came into operation on 30th of September, 1894. This "Act to make better provisions for the Equalisation of Rates as between the different parts of London," was not passed with the object, as might be assumed from the title, of creating a uniform system of rating in the metropolis, but i order to afford relief to the poorer parishes at the expense of the richer. By virtue of the Act, St. George the Martyr may draw upwards of £4,000 annually, paid half-yearly, and chiefly by the richer districts of the City of London, St. George's, Hanover Square, the Strand, Kensington, Westminster, Paddington, and Hampstead. [Section 6 of the Act definitely states that the sum mentioned by me " shall be applied in defraying the expenses of the Sanitary Authority, incurred under the 50 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and so far as not required for that purpose those incurred in respect of streets." From this it appears that not a penny of the money can be touched for purposes of lighting the roads and other expenses, until all the provisions of the Public Health Act be carried out. Section 7 requires every Sanitary Authority to whom a sum is paid under this Act, to render to the Local Government Board a true account for the year in question, of the total amount of the expenses incurred by the Authority, under each of the following heads:— (a) Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, (b) in respect of lighting, and (c) in respect of streets, and showing the amount expended in respect of each head, out of the sums paid to such Authority under this Act. Section 8 says, that where the Local Government Board, under Section 101 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are satisfied that a Sanitary Authority has been guilty of such default as in that Section mentioned, and has made an order limiting a time for performance of the duty of the Authority, the London County Council shall, if so directed by the Local Government Board, withhold the whole, or any part of the payment (if any) next accruing, due from the Equalisation Fund to such Sanitary Authority. It thus appears that the old plea of poverty which has proved so cogent in the past, can now no longer be urged as an obstacle to sanitary progress in the parish. On the other hand, the contributing parishes will naturally look for some return for their expenditure. To put the matter in another form, rich and healthy Hampstead will expect poor St. George the Martyr to do its best to lessen the—at present—unnecessary infectious sick and death-rate. If this be done by means of Hampstead's money and the provisions of the Health Act, there will be less risk of infection being carried from tenements and slums of poverty-stricken districts to wealthier neighbourhoods.

(The first part of this report is omitted. It dealt with personal matters raised by certain members of the Vestry). My attention was drawn by the Works Committee to the sanitary condition of St. George's Buildings. After a careful inspection, I may say briefly, that beyond a few minor defects their sanitary condition is good. At the same time, I find there exists a grave defect in the sewerage, that is to say, in that part of the drainage that comes under the control of your Vestry. The drain from the building, together with the sewer into which it opens, has been examined under my personal direction. Both were constructed of glazed pipes laid on loose earth, and left open at the joints. The result is that after many years the sewer has settled in different places, 52 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. so that the lengths of piping run up and down in zig-zag fashion, while between their ends wide leaking gaps have been created. The fall of the sewer is deficient. There is a short, sharp descent from the building, followed by a long and inadequate drop to where it discharges, apparently in a direction opposite to the current of the main sewer. After these statements, the Vestry will not be surprised to hear that the sewer was choked in the greater part of its course, and that the surrounding soil was saturated with sewage to such an extent as to be a danger to health. It will be seen that the drainage system, to which attention has been called, illustrates almost every defect that could be contrived by bad workmanship, and allowed to pass by careless supervision. The cost of putting this sewer into proper condition, I should estimate at some considerable sum. There can be on doubt as to the urgent need of reconstruction in this particular case. I may add that this is the first time that my attention has been drawn to the important question of the sewerage of our " model dwellings." House to House Inspection. The first Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, directs that a house to house inspection shall be made by the Local Authority. Such a visitation as that intended by the framers of the Act was—for the first time in the history of this parish—commenced in 1894. t During 1895 1613 house to house inspections have been made, and the results of such visits have been entered into the registers kept for the purpose. To repeat the words made use of in my last year's report, " I may, perhaps, be allowed to add my opinion, that this system of house to house inspection is likely to do more towards raising the general health standard of your district than any single step yet taken by your Vestry." Houses Let in Lodgings An attempt has been made, during the year under report, to enforce the new Byelaws made in compliance with the Public Health Act, with respect to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. So far, 151 dwelling-houses, inhabited by the poorest classes have been registered in conformity with the Bye-laws. In this parish, houses built on the so-called "model" or block system, and accommodating upwards of 12,800 inmates, at present escape the salutary provisions of the new Bye-laws. These dwellings, often inhabited by the uneducated and unruly poor, are for the most part badly supervised. I would beg once more to enter my protest that such "models" should be included, in the interests of the public health, within the purview of the New Tenement Bye-laws. Such a reform could be accomplished by means of an amendment of the Public Health Act. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 53 Copy of Placard Distributed Within the Parish on Small-pox and its Prevention. The best means of Preventing the Attack of the Disease, and of Stopping it when it has Broken Out. It is required by Law that every child be vaccinated within three months of its birth ; parents or persons in charge of infants are liable to prosecution and fines for omission. It cannot be too widely known that Vaccination is one of the best means of preventing an attack of Small-pox. All persons above twelve years of age should be Re-vaccinated. When Small-pox prevails in a family or neighbourhood, every person should be immediately Re-vaccinated. When an individual has Small-pox, everything should be done to separate the person attacked from those around. Since Small-pox is pre-eminently contagious in all stages of the disease every case should be at once removed to a Small-pox Hospital. If the patient be treated at home the sick-room should be cleared of all needless furniture, including woollen or other draperies, which serve to harbour the contagion. No person should be allowed to enter the room, except those who are attending upon the sick. Where persons have had Small-pox, whether they get well or die, the room in which they have been ill, and all articles therein should be disinfected. The inhabitants of the parish who may at any time have any bedding or clothing which requires to be disinfected, are requested to give notice thereof, without delay, at the Vestry Hall, Borough Road; such articles will then be removed by the Officers of the Vestry, disinfected and returned without any charge whatever.

Regulations as to Furnishing Information Relative to the Condition of Patients, and as to the Visiting of Patients. Information as to Conditions of Patients :— 2. Upon the admission of a patient, a letter will be sent to the nearest known relative or friend, setting forth the state of the patient. Should any serious change for the worse take place, a letter will be sent daily to the relative or friend, stating how the patient is progressing; which letter will be continued until the patient is in such a condition as to render further communications unnecessary. But should the patient become dangerously ill notice will be sent to the nearest known relative or intimate friend, with an intimation that the patient may be visited; and, at the discretion of the Medical Superintendent, arrangements may be made for the conveyance of the visitor to and from the hospital. 3. Enquires as to the conditions of patients must be made in writing to the Medical Superintendent, who will reply by return of post. It is very undesirable that friends of patients should personally make enquiries at the hospital. 4. The visiting of patients is limited to the nearest relatives and intimate friends of patients dangerously ill. One visit only will be allowed daily to each patient. Visits, which will not be allowed without the permission of the Medical Superintendent, are, as a rule, to be limited in duration to a quarter of an hour. In urgent and special cases, however, the Medical Superintendent is empowered to increase the number of visitors to two, and to extend the duration of the visit. 5. Visitors are warned that they run great risk in entering the hospitals. They are advised not to go into the wards of the small-pox hospitals without having been properly re-vaccinated, and if they reside where the case visited occurred, are earnestly requested to urge the remainder of the occupiers of such house to call at once on the Public Vaccinator (whose address can be obtained from any of the parish officers) for the purpose of being vaccinated. 6. Visitors are further advised not to enter the wards in any of the hospitals when in a weak state of health or in an exhausted condition, but to partake of a good meal before entering the hospital. They will be required when in the wards to carefully avoid touching the patient, or exposing themselves to his breath, or to the emanations from his skin ; and will not be permitted to sit on the bed or handle the bed-clothes, but will be allowed to sit on a chair at the bedside at some little distance from the patient. 7. Visitors will also be required to wear a wrapper (to be provided by the Board) to cover their dress when in the wards, and to wash their hands and faces with carbolic soap and water before leaving the hospital, or to use such other mode of disinfection as may be directed by the Medical Superintendent. 8. Visitors are strongly urged not to enter any omnibus, tramcar, or other public conveyance, immediately after leaving the hospital.

The drivers of the Board's ambulances are not allowed to loiter on their journeys or to stop for refreshments on pain of instant dismissal. It is particularly requested that any breach of this regulation, or any neglect or incivility on the part of drivers, nurses, or attendants may be immediately reported. The servants of the Board are forbidden to accept any gratuities or refreshments. N.B.—PENALTY.—By Section 70 of the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," it is enacted that—"It shall not be lawful for any owner or driver of a public "conveyance knowingly to convey, or for any other person knowingly to place "in any public conveyance, a person suffering from any dangerous infectious "disease, or for a person suffering from any such disease to enter any public "conveyance, and if he does so he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding TEN "POUNDS . . . ." Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1895. 57 THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. PART II. No. 4. London (Falcon Court, Borough) Improvement Scheme, 1895. scheme For the improvement of an area situate in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, in the County of London, in pursuance of the provisions of Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. PRELIMINARY. Whereas under the provisions of the 39th Section of Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, the London County Council (hereinafter called "the Council") did on the 2nd of July, 1895, pass a resolution that it appeared to the Council that the closeness, narrowness, bad arrangement, and bad condition of the buildings situate upon a certain area known as the Falcon Court, Borough, area, comprising houses in Birdcage Alley, Falcon Court, Brent's Court, Eve's Place (lately known as Adam's Place), Redcross Place and Maypole Alley, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, in the County of London, delineated and coloured red on the plan then before the Council marked "A," and the want of light, air, ventilation, and proper conveniences, and other sanitary defects in the said buildings were dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants of the said buildings and of the neighbouring buildings; and that the demolition, re-construction, and re-arrangement of the said buildings was necessary to remedy the said evils, and that the area comprising those buildings, and the yards, outhouses, and appurtenances thereof, and the site thereof was too small to be dealt with as an healthy area under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and the Council did by that resolution direct a scheme to be prepared under Part II. of the said Act for the improvement of the said area. Now, therefore, the Council in furtherance of such resolution, and in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, and the powers of the said Act, conferred upon it, doth make the scheme following, that is to say:— IMPROVEMENT AREA. The lands, buildings, and premises delineated and coloured red on the plan marked Part II. (No. 4) to this scheme annexed, on which plan the buildings referred to in the before-recited resolution are coloured red, are the lands and buildings situate in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, in the County of London, which constitute the Improvement Area, to which the scheme refers. 58 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. ACQUISITION OF LAND. The lands, buildings, and premises constituting the said Improvement Area or any of them may, for the purposes of this scheme, be taken Compulsorily. APPROPRIATION OF LANDS. Such lands, buildings, and premises, when acquired by the Council, may be sold, let, or otherwise disposed of by the Council for commercial or other purposes, but no part thereof shall be used for the re-housing of any of the persons of the working classes displaced by the scheme, the position and configuration of the area, and the character of the surrounding property, rendering it unsuitable for that purpose, provided, nevertheless, that the Council shall upon other land to be acquired by it within the said Parish of St George the Martyr, Southwark, under the powers of Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, erect dwellings to accommodate not less than 500 persons of the working classes, to the satisfaction of one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State. EXECUTION OF SCHEME.
