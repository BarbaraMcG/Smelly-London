EHI 41 THE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT (WITH VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS), FOR THE YEAR 1S95. (CONSISTING OF 52 WEEKS), being the TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT, BY JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; diplomate in public health, university of cambridge fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health; associate of the college of state medicine; member of the sanitary institute; public vaccinator to the whitechapel union; examiner in, and instructor of, vaccination, by order local government board; &c. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE STEVENS & CO., LTD. 19 & 25A, Commercial Road, E. 1896. office of the borad of Works for the Whitechapel District. public health Department: No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E. January lStlt, 1896. Gentlemen, I propose in this Report to give as much general and particular information as possible by means of Tables, so arranged that they may be readily compared with similar Tables for past years. This information will be supplemented by certain additional Tables. Where it. appears necessary to do so, I shall explain, and enlarge upon, the facts to be deduced from the figures comprising the Tables. In the first place it should be possible to state the correct population of the Whitechapel District. The ordinary rules, however, which apply to most Districts, fail with us to give even approximately the number of persons living in the four Sub-registration Districts which comprise the area under your jurisdiction. Foreign aliens come and go with that freedom which makes our Country remarkable among the nations of the world. A return, so far as the immigration of Polish Jews was concerned, was kept up to the middle of last year by your Inspectors. At that time the returns ceased, and since then I can only surmise, without being in a position to check my opinion, that fewer foreigners arrived in Whitechapel during 1895, than was the case in previous years. On the other hand, I believe that less emigration took place, so that probably a balance was preserved equal to that of former years. I append the information which reached the office up to June last. The following are the figures:— Total number of Aliens who came into the Whitechapel District from January 1st to June 12th, 1,158. Verified as remaining in the District 653 Removed into other Districts, or went abroad441 Returned to their Native Towns 61 of the Whitechapel District I have loughlv The total population estimated to be 79,000. The marriages during the year within the District amounted to 409. Last year they were 373, and in the previous year they were 550. The total births which were registered in the four Sub-registration Districts during the 52 weeks amounted to 3,133. In the Whitechapel Union Infirmary 130 births took place, of which number 21 were born of women who had not previously resided in the District. Distributing the remaining births among the Sub-registration Districts to which the mothers belonged, the correct distribution of births will be as under :— Spitalfields. Mile End New Town. Whitechapel Church. Goodman's Fields. Total. 956 873 859 424 3112 The District birth-rate was equal to 39-3 per 1,000. The Metropolitan birth-rate equalled 30.4 per 1,000. 4 The total deaths which were registered during the year numbered 2,544, viz.:—1.424 boys and 1,120 girls. Table B* of the Appendix indicates the deaths which were registered in the several Sub-Registration Districts. A deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 972, which occurred among non-residents, nearly all of whom died in the London Hospital; and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those Residents who died in Outlying Public Institutions, and elsewhere, outside the District. These deaths numbering 232, and the places where the deaths were registered are tabulated in the Appendix as usual.t Thus the corrected number of District deaths for the year was 1,804. A death-rate for the year of 22.8 per 1,000 is to be recorded, as compared with a Metropolitan death-rate of 19.7 per 1,000. These statements shew an increased death-rate over the previous year of 2.0 per 1,000 for London as a whole, and 2.5 per 1,000 for the Whitechapel District. Probably the severe cold during the early part of the year may account for this decline from the satisfactory statement which I produced twelve months since, as the increased mortality is distributed fairly throughout the District. I append a Table shewing the correct number of District deaths for each Sub-registration District during the past ten years. CORRECT DISTRICT MORTALITY TABLE FOR TEN YEARS ENDING 1895.

In the two preceding years it was 1,568 and 1,194 respectively. The ages at death of the Residents who died during the year are recorded in Table Ft of the Appendix. The percentage of deaths for each Age period was as follows :— 26.7% of the toial deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 17.8 ,, ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.2 „ „ „ „ 5 and 20. 13.9 ., ,, „ „ 20 and 40. 17.4 „ „ „ „ 40 and 60. 16.4 „ „ „ „ 60 and 80. 2.6,, ,, ,, over the age of 80. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths, including Whitechapel, the infant deaths were as follows:— The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 255 per cent, of the total deaths, and 16.5 per cent, of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 26.7 per cent, of the total deaths, and 15.4 per cent, of the registered births. * Page 32 of the Appendix. † Page 33. 5 The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.3 per cent, of the total deaths, and 26.2 per cent, of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 44.6 per cent, of the total deaths, and 25.7 per cent, of the registered births. Table I* has been introduced to enable one readily to contrast the mortality per cent, from each class of disease to total deaths, as regards both the Whitechapel District and the Metropolis as a whole. Our District appears in a happier position than the entire Metropolis in the following causes of death:— Zymotic diseases; Diseases following upon Privation and Alcoholism; Diseases of the Nervous System; and Accidents. In 1894 the figures for Zymotic diseases were for London 17.45, and for Whitechapel 15.62. In the year now under consideration London shews 1710, whereas the percentage for Whitechapel has diminished to 14.57. Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria have again taxed to the utmost the resources of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board. I know that the Managers have been most assiduous in their endeavours to cope with the difficulties by which they were surrounded. It has become certain that more hospital accommodation is needed. I have more than once pointed out the necessity of early removal to hospital of cases of infectious diseases in such a District as Whitechapel. The value of isolation depends largely upon the perfection of the system whereby all infected persons can be immediately withdrawn from crowded districts, so that fresh centres for spreading disease may be avoided. I extract a memorandum from Mr. Cook's Eeport on the subject:— "A delay occurred in the removal of patients early in July and again " in September, recurring occasionally nearly to the end of the year. "In 35 cases 3 applications were made for the removal of patients. ,, 2o ,, 4 ,, ,, ft „ 8 „ 5 ,, ,, ,, „ 11 „ 6 „ „ „ „ 6 „ 7 ,, ,, ,, „9 „ 8 „ „ „ „ „2 „ 9 9 „ 2 „ 10 „ 1 „11 „ „ „ " Eleven cases refused removal owing to delay in removal after applica" tion had been made. " Sixty-three cases were taken home from the Loudon Hospital because " the Asylums' Board could not provide accommodation for them in the " Hospitals. " In many cases the home consisted of one room." I would, however, emphasize the fact that the Officers of the Metropolitan Asylum's Board showed every consideration for the necessities of the District so far as was consonant with their duty to the other portions of the Metropolis. It is unfortunate that Scarlet Fever cases have to be isolated for a considerable time after the acute symptoms have subsided. If these cases could be removed to suburban convalescent homes a great many beds would be set free to accommodate the new cases, and thus probably the late difficulty might not be repeated. * Page 35. 6 Small-pox was present in the District to an extent which gave me considerable anxiety. I think perhaps I may best place on record the chief facts concerning the outbreak by reproducing the Tables of cases which accompanied my Reports to your Board. Copies of these Reports and the sheets referred to were forwarded to the Local Government Board. With the cases recorded upon these sheets the outbreak terminated. Several cases were subsequently notified, but they proved upon further investigation not to have been Small-pox. SMALL-POX IN WHITECHAPEL. Beport to the Board of Tforks for the Whitechapel District presented by the Medical Officer of Health on Monday, August 19th, 1895:— On Monday, the 22nd ultimo, I reported to your Board that Small-pox had appeared in the Whitechapel District in such numbers as to threaten an epidemic of the disease. Your Board having discussed the subject, referred the consideration to a special Sanitary Meeting to be convened on Wednesday, the 24th, at, 6 p.m. Power to act as they deemed necessary was given to the Committee. The Sanitary Committee met as arranged, and Messrs. Stephens and Lamb from the Salvation Army were present on the invitation of the Committee. These gentlemen agreed to assist the Officers of the Board in every way with a view to counteract the risk of spreading Small-pox through the medium of the occupants of their shelters. With this intent it was arranged that after that night no persons should be admitted into their shelters who were not in the possession of tickets: this would eliminate a danger from the presence of strangers who might come from other spheres of contagion. It was also agreed that certain proceedings as regards daily and special disinfection should be conducted under the inspection of the officers of the Board. They also undertook that no person apparently suffering from Small-pox should be allowed to go into the public thoroughfares, but that such person should be isolated, and when seen by a Medical man should be treated as directed by such Medical practitioner. On the following day I reported the outbreak of the epidemic to the Secretary of the Local Government Board, to whom a few davs later your Clerk reported th« result of your deliberation, and he also sent a copy of a resolution which you passed with reference to the influence Salvation Army Shelters exercised upon the District, and the desire of your Board was conveyed to the Local Government Board that some legislation might be provided to place these shelters upon the same footing as the Registered Common Lodging-houses. These houses are under certain regulations which are framed under the Lodging-houses Acts. These regulations are now administered by the London County Council. It is felt that shelters which are in themselves totally unsuitable for the purpose, and into which large numbers of the lowest class of persons are crowded, must influence very adversely the health of the District generally. At present, in the absence of regulations, it would be difficult to obtain a conviction before a Magistrate in a prosecution for overcrowding, because those allowances of space which can be enforced in the case of Registered Common Lodging-houses, are thought by many to be too liberal to be applied to Philanthropic Shelters. On August the 2nd a letter was received from the Secretary of the Local Government Board addressed to your Clerk. It called attention to the fact that Small-pox was on the increase in the Metropolis, and it pointed out that the season of the year was not the season when a large increase usually took place. The Board was then requested to instruct the Medical Officer of Health to visit all cases of Small-pox, and " to take such measures as may be necessary to secure "as far as practicable the isolation of the patient, the vaccination of any persons "who may have been exposed to infection, and the disinfection of the premises, "and any further action which the circumstances will admit of for the purpose "of checking the extension of the disease." The Secretary, in conclusion, adds:—" The Board deem it desirable that the authority should, as regards each "case, be informed precisely of the measures which have been taken by the "Medical Officer of Health, and they will be glad to bo furnished witli copies of "the Reports which are made by him on the subject." 7 This is the first meeting of your Board since the receipt of that letter, and I beg therefore to submit for your inspection a complete list of all cases notified as Small-pox, since, and including, the 9th July last. The total number of cases amounted to 75. Of these it was discovered upon examination at the Wharf belonging to the Metropolitan Asylum's Board that 3 cases were erroneously diagnosed. These patients were accordingly re-vaccinated and returned to their homes. I have also been informed by returns from Somerset House that 2 deaths from Small-pox have taken place from amongst our cases in the hospital ships—one aged 25, unvaccinated, and the other 39 years old, said to have been vaccinated in infancy. In none of the cases had re-vaccination been performed previously to exposure, but in 1 case the disease was contracted where vaccination was performed 2J days after the patient had been exposed to the risk of contagion. In the only young child who contracted Small-pox it was with its two elder brothers at the time the exposure occurred; they were vaccinated and escaped, the other was unvaccinated and suffered from Small-pox in its confluent form. Only 2 of the cases remained at home for treatment. They were both very modified cases of the disease, and were allowed to remain at home because means of isolation were present to satisfy the doctor in attendance. In each case the Medical practitioner gave a certificate to that effect. This Report takes into consideration 6 weeks particulars. It will be seen that the cases per week which were notified took place as follows:— During the week ending July 13th there were 3 cases. ,, ,, 20th ,, 3 ,, 27th „ 43 „ „ August 3rd ,, 8 „ „ „ 10th „ 13 „ „ „ 17th „ 5 ,, The period has of course expired during which the 43 cases in the above Table could exert any influence upon the District. I am of opinion that the rapid isolation and thorough disinfection carried out in every case, together with revaccination, which lias gone hand in hand with the other measures, must claim much of the credit for the want of power which the disease has exhibited to spread itself more throughout the District. Whitechapel has been for very many years admittedly one of the best vaccinated Districts in London, and the value of such claim must be apparent when one considers the fact that although such a splendid opportunity has been afforded to Small-pox to become alarmingly epidemic in Whitechapel, yet out of a total of 72 cases of the disease only 18 have taken place in private houses; in 1 case the child had not been vaccinated and in all the other cases sufficient time had elapsed for the primary vaccination to have lost a great deal of its prophylactic power. No re-vaccinated person properly so called contracted the disease. A second letter as to persons who had Small-pox, and who were not removed to hospital, was received from the Local Government Board. The matters mentioned therein have been included in the above Report. I have only to add that I have supplied the Infirmary Medical Superintendent with Vaccine Lymph sufficient to re-vaccinate the staff and many of the patients. So far as I can learn, only one woman—a scrubber at the Infirmarycontracted Small-pox. She had not been re-vaccinated. I believe that I have re-vaccinated nearly all the persons who are employed at the Salvation Army Shelter in the Whitechapel Road, and also the men employed at the Victoria Home, No. 1 in Commercial Street, where 8 of the cases occurred. As a matter of fact, therefore, 50 per cent, of the cases were reported as coming from Salvation Army Shelters, 25 per cent, from private houses, and 25 per cent, from Registered Common Lodging-houses, the Whitechapel Infirmary, and from all outside Philanthropic Shelters. At present about 16 of the cases may be centres from which fresh cases may arise, and to these our attention must remain for the present directed.

Friend of No. 56 11 Offices of the Board of Wokks for the Whitechapel District, No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., September 30tli, 1895 To the Board of Works, Gentlemen, At your last Meeting on the 19th August, 1895, I submitted to you a Beport which dealt with the cases of Small pox notified within the District. Up to that date the total number amounted to 75. During the 6 weeks which have since elapsed, I have received 19 notifications of Small-pox cases. Eleven patients resided in private houses, all but 2 of these were removed to Hospital. Of these 1 was too ill to be removed, and death occurred from Hosmorrhagic Sinall-pox. The body was coffined—disinfectants were freely used—and burial took place within 2 days aiter death. I re-vaccinated persons who had been exposed to the risk of contagion, and no further case was reported in the same street. Seven patients were removed from Registered Common LodgingHouses, and 1 from the Whitechapel Union Infirmary. No re-vaccinated person was attacked by Small-pox. One of the cases was allowed to remain isolated at home by permission of the doctor in attendance. I append a list of the details concerning the patients. It is constructed as a continuation of the sheet which I presented with my first Eeport. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. 12 1895.—SMALL-POX NOTIFICATIONS IN WIIITECHAPEL AFTER 16th AUGUST. SECOND LIST. No. Date of No tification. Eruption Appeared.

To those interested in the important question of Yaccination these particulars should be interesting and instructive. 14 Four bad been re-vaccinated before being exposed to the risk of contagion. *Partirulars of the 3 Cases :— M. 7 months, vaccinated 2nd November, 1895, Eruption appeared on the 9th of the month. M. 2 months, vaccinated 30th July, 1895, Eruption appeared on the 13th August. M. 14 months, vaccinated on the 23rd of the month, and 2 days later the Eruption appeared. These cases should therefore be removed into the "unvaccinated " class. I sent to Dr. Ricketts, the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital Ships, a list of all reported cases of Small-pox under the age of 11, classified as "unvaccinated." The Doctor very kindly reported to me details of each case. There were in all 14 cases. One proved not to have been Small-pox. Six were unvaccinated. Four had no Foveated Cicatrices. All who bad been protected had the disease mildly. All the unprotected had the form of disease known as "Severe Discrete." And still there are men who affect to decry the prophylactic powers of vaccination. Still, they state that the vaccine virus is altogether different in its origin from the virus of Small-pox, and that it consists of a materies morbi of some dangerous kind. These men deny the truth that vaccinia in the human subject is small-pox in the cow. If proof were required that this is so, it is forthcoming in a third case recently reported upon by Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, where an infant who was vaccinated at the same time as other children, and from the same lymph with which they were vaccinated, developed Small-pox, whereas all the others had the ordinary vaccine disease, thus clearly showing the possibility of a reversion to the original disease. In such cases, however, there is no contagious power present in the patient. One fact appears to me to be prominently shown in the Table which I present above. In vaccinated subjects the immunity becomes considerably less after the age of 10 years. It appears, therefore, reasonable to urge that re-vaccination should be employed before that age has been passed. After the age of 20, those who are only protected by infant vaccination incur considerable risk if they become exposed to the contagion of Small-pox.

It must be remembered that for the chief diseases in this class every case calls for complete investigation; forwarding a notice to the Asylums' Board where removal is wished for; sending a notice to the head teacher of the School where children from the infected house attend; serving a sanitary notice for cleansing of the room which the patient occupied, after disinfection has taken place; removal of bedding, clothing, &c., to the disinfecting apparatus, and returning the same; and attending to the general improvement in sanitation, &c., where required. As a matter of routine work, every system of house drainage is tested after a case of infectious disease. The disinfecting apparatus has proved most serviceable during the year, and the passage of superheated steam through articles which have been exposed to infection no doubt has done much to prevent a larger number of cases of disease than is here recorded. As a matter germane to public health I would express satisfaction with the works carried on at the Destructor Yard, associated as they are with the systematic removal and destruction of all house refuse. The pail system has been now so far extended that practically a daily collection of refuse takes place. Your Engineer and Surveyor will probably report upon the general work, so far as "dusting and slopping" is concerned, therefore it would be superfluous to enlarge upon the subject in this Report. You have added another public convenience during the year to the two which were already in use. These are all working satisfactorily, and are movements in the right direction. Your Inspectors have been most energetic in improving the drainage of the houses within the District. I find that 655 drains have been altered, improved, or re-constructed during the year. Generally the existing frontage into the sewer suffices, but it was necessary that 34 new frontages should be inserted. "Combined drainage," which has been discussed ad nauseam, at your meetings, has been a burning question in some cases, but difficulties which might have been troublesome have been removed by the kindly feeling which exists between Owners of property aud your Officers. During the past 3 years no fewer than 2,061 drainage improvements have been effected, and it requires no assurance from me to convince you of the important effect which has thus been produced upon the conditions which are requisite for health within those bouses which have been so improved. I am glad to know that your Engineer and Purveyor, Mr. J. Paget Waddington, proposes to introduce many improvements, so far as the general sewers of the District which are under your control are concerned. I am hoping now soon to see issued from the Surveyor's Office a new map of the District; so many changes have taken place since the last issue that the existing map has become ob jolete. Old Age Deaths. The number of persons who died after the age of 80 amounted to 46, of these 15 were men and 31 were women. Between the ages of 80 and 85, there were registered 24 deaths; 13 between the ages of 85 and 90; and 9 over the age of 90. One man lived to the age of 95, and one woman to the age of 97. Nearly all the deaths were due to "Old Age" and " Bronchitis." * Page 42. 16 Violent Deaths. Fifty-two deaths were registered as due to different forms of violence. Burns and Scalds were responsible for 13 deaths; Street Accidents caused 1G deaths; Drowning occurred in 3 cases; 11 infants were Suffocated through the carelessness of their parents or nurses; 8 persons committed Suicide in various ways; and 1 death was due to Suffocation from blocking of the trachea with food.

In 1894 the number admitted was 182. Upon 169 of the bodies inquests were held, and 16 were admitted for the purpose of awaiting interment only. Only 7 cases of death from Zymotic Diseases were included in the admissions into the Mortuary, viz.:—Diphtheria, 4; Measles, 1: Scarlet Fever, 1; and Membranous Croup, 1. For the use of the Court the Fees paid by the Coroner during the year amounted to the sum of £30 9s. 0d. Mr. and Mrs. Hoff were elected in the spring to do duty as Mortuary Attendants. They are compelled to reside some little distance from the Mortuary, and thus the full value of the services of the new officers has not yet been received. It is hoped that soon arrangements will be made so that their services may be available at all hours. If I do not discuss this question at length in my Beport it is not because I deem it of less importance than usual, but on Water Supply account of the fact that, owing to the Local Governin the ment Board investigation into the action of the East Whiteehapel London Water Company, the matter must be considered District. still as being sub-judice. The Inquiry was instigated by the Hackney Vestry, and officials from some Metropolitan Districts attended to give evidence. I sent some particulars to the Hackney Vestry concerning short and intermittent water supply to parts of the District, and I proffered the services of an Inspector to prove the facts. Of course it could not be proved that the deficiency of water 17 was the cause of any special sickness, although many persons were much inconvenienced by the limited supply which was given, and the awkward time which was chosen for its distribution. There has been a Bill drafted for presentation to Parliament next Session to promote the supply of sea water to the inhabitants of London. I wish it every success. Kegistered Common Lodging-houses have now been controlled by the London County Council for more than a year. I have been supplied by the Medical Officer cT Health with a list of such houses. I have myself inspected many of them and am able to bear witness to the thorough manner in which the work is being performed. The total has again been reduced to 80. Many improvements of a structural character have been, and are being, carried out. It is still, however, certain that many of the existing houses require to be dealt with. I am aware that in some cases leases will shortly expire, and then no doubt the Surveyor to the Council will interpose to prevent a continuance of the Licenses. The Lodging-houses provide accommodation for 5,612 persons, who are, generally speaking, not stationary for long at a time. I understand that where the lodgers are selected by the deputies, as is the case with the " Victoria Homes," and with the new house of Mr. Wildermuth, they are more permanent in their habits, and generally occupy the same beds every night. I append a list as usual, shewing the number of deaths among the inhabitants of these houses where such deaths took place in the Whiteehapel Union Infirmary or other Public Institution.

We have 4 Salvation Army Shelters in the District, and 8 other shelters of various deEcriptions. The latter altogether provide for so few that I need scarcely allude to them. If we eliminate Barnardo's Shelters, which contributed 58 persons to the Union Infirmary and Workhouse during the year, only 37 were left to represent the remaining shelters. I append several interesting sets of figures showing the results of the rivalry which exists between the two classes of Lodging-houses which compete for the custom of the poorest classes. Salvation Army Shelters at the time I am writing provide accommodation for 956 persons in the 4 buildings. The Common Lodging-houses are registered to accommodate 5,612 persons. The former contributed 23 per cent, of the total admissions which took place into the Poor Law Institutions of the District, and the latter assisted to the extent of 44.3 per cent. So that whereas the former provide accommodation for about a sixth of the number provided for by the Owners of the Registered Common Lodging-houses, they feed the Workhouse and Infirmary to the extent of more than one half the number coming from the Registered Common Lodging-houses. Many conclusions may be drawn from a perusal of the Tables here appended by those who care to do so. During the last half of the year I have had much correspondence with the Officers of the Salvation Army, and some interviews have also taken place, on the general subject of improved ventilation and also upon the minimum accommodation which should be provided for (acl i shelter. I have to record my appreciation of the great courtesy which I have always received from these gentlemen. The accommodation is provided by means of bunks, single beds, or tiers of bunks. The difficulty was to arrive at some standard minimum measurement of space to be allotted to each person using the shelters. I claimed that as the Local Government Board insisted upon 30 superficial feet of floor space per head in their Casual Wards, such should be the lowest limit which each bunk or bed should occupy. This would have reduced the accommodation so greatly that consent could not be given to the proposition. 19 It is unfortunate that excepting where bye-laws are in use, or in the case of the Factory and Workshops Acts, no help is given by Public Health Statutes in fixing the minimum air space to be allowed per head. Each case must be dealt with upon its merits. Recently at the South wark Police Court, after many hearings, Mr. Slade decided that the Blackfriars' Shelter might accommodate 650 persons without, in his opinion, being overcrowded. Nearly double that number had upon certain occasions been admitted. Since this decision was given Mr. Lamb and Dr. Bremner representing the Salvation Army, and myself acting on behalf of the Board, had a conference. We agreed that although I had in no way altered my opinion as to the minimum of floor space per head which should be allowed, yet if the shelters in the Whiteehapel District were provided with bunks or beds only to accommodate the number which, according to Mr. Slade's opinion, might be accommodated at their Blackfriars Shelter without overcrowding existing, then no action would be recommended to be taken by the Board. It was stipulated that a Surveyor on each side should meet and agree as to the measurements of each room. Your Surveyor and a gentleman on behalf of Mr. Booth have already completed this most necessary part of the undertaking. I need only add that improvements in ventilation and lighting, and drainage where requisite, have either been effected or will be carried out. shelters.

I offer for your consideration various details concerning Model Dwellings. They deserve very great attention, belonging as they do to buildings which house about a sixth of the entire population of the District. At a future time I propose to discuss the influence upon your District which the presence of Model Dwellings exerts. The statistics which are contained in this and all my previous Eeports will prove useful for this purpose. MODEL DWELLINGS, 1895. Name and Situation of Dwellings. Number of Apartments.

Perhaps Sanitary at the present time few legal matters are more confusing Legislation to Sanitary Officials than those which are contained in in 1895. the various Acts known as "The Factory and Workshops' Acts." Not only are they full of difficulties and doubts so far as the meaning of some sections is concerned, but it often happens that one becomes doubtful as to whether certain works should be undertaken by the Factory Inspector, or by the Medical Officer of Health. Now of course overlapping in such cases might mean friction between officers of different authorities—it certainly means waste of time. I have hitherto avoided such difficulty by a friendly co-operation with the chief Factory Inspector. To prevent misunderstanding in the working of the new Act, I have been in communication with the Home Office Officials, and I hope soon to have all the machinery ready for carrying out that portion of the Act which belongs to the Public Health Department of your Board. The Act commences by stating that a factory or a workshop shall "be deemed to be so overcrowded as to be "dangerous or injurious to the health of the persons employed therein, "if the number of cubic feet of space in any room therein bears to the "number of persons employed at once in the room a proportion less "than 250, or, during any period of overtime, 400 cubic feet of space to "every person." Power is provided for the Secretary of State to vary these allowances under certain circumstances. It would appear that it is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to enforce this section so far as ordinary day labour is concerned, and for overtime work the Factory Inspector becomes responsible. It would simplify matters for one of the officers to undertake the whole duty contained in the section I have quoted. The number of persons who may legally be employed in each room must be posted up in the room. If one officer saw to this arrangement it would prevent the possibility of duplicating the work. In the 1878 Factory and Workshop Act it was enacted that any nuisance discovered by the Factory Inspector should be brought to the notice of the Sanitary Authority. In the 1891 Act it was competent for the Home Office Inspector to take proceedings in the event of the Sanitary Authority not doing so "within a reasonable time." In such case all costs incurred could be recovered from the local authority. It is now declared that a reasonable time means "within one month." It is further provided that the Sanitary Authority shall inform the Factory Inspector of the proceedings taken by them in consequence of the notice which they have received from him. A considerable addition to the official clerical work will be the outcome of this scction of the new Act. 23 Section 5 authorizes the Secretary of State to name classes of work by Order, which would render places injurious or dangerous to health. If persons are employed in such places, a penalty of £10 is incurred. Section 6 recites, "if any occupier of a factory, or workshop or laundry, "or of any place from which any work is given out, or any contractor "employed by any such occupier, causes or allows wearing apparel to be "made, cleaned, or repaired in any dwelling-house or buildiDg occupied "therewith, whilst any inmate of the dwelling-house is suffering from "scarlet fever, or small-pox, then, unless he proves that he was not "aware of the existence of the illness in the dwelling-house, and could "not reasonably have been expected to become aware of it, he shall be "liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds." It would be interesting to know why in framing this Act the authors only included scarlet fever and small-pox. Other diseases are communicable through articles of clothing. Certain restrictions as to overtime of young persons and women, as well as matters concerning the employment on the same day of children, young persons and women inside and outside a factory or workshop, are included in Sections 14, 15 and 16. Bakehouses are cared for by Section 27. By the Act of 1878, only bakehouses in places where more than 5,000 persons live, come within the operations of some of its most important provisions. Now all bakehouses share the same fate. "When I mention the fact that the Sections provide for the periodical cleansing of the interior of bakehouses, and prohibit them and their passages being used for sleeping purposes, the importance of the new departure will be understood, although of course it does not affect the Whiteehapel District". No place underground not in use as a bakehouse at the present time can legally be so used at any future time, A register of such places has been already prepared by your officers for future use. Section 29 is as follows:—"Every medical practitioner attending on "or called in to visit a patient whom he believes to be suffering from "lead, phosphorus, or arsenical poisoning, or anthrax, contracted in any "factory or workshop shall (unless the notice required by this Section1 has been previously sent) send to the Chief Inspector of Factories at "the Home Office, London, a notice stating the name and full postal "address of the patient and the disease from which in the opinion of the "medical practitioner the patient is suffering, and shall be entitled in "respect of every notice sent in pursuance of this Section to a fee of two "shillings and sixpence to be paid as part of the expenses incurred by "the Secretary of State, in the execution of the principal Act. If any "medical practitioner, when required by this Section to send a notice, "fails forthwith to send the same, he shall be liable to a fine not "exceeding forty shillings. "Written notice of every case of lead, phosphorus, or arsenical "poisoning, or anthrax, occurring in a factory or workshop, shall forth"with be sent to the Inspector, and to the Certifying Surgeon for the "District; and the provisions of the Factory Acts with respect to "accidents shall apply in any such case in like manner as to any such "accident as is in those Sections mentioned. "The Secretary of State may by order made in accordance with "Section 65 of the principal Act apply the provisions of this Section to "any other diseasS occurring in a factory or workshop, and thereupon "this Section and the provisions referred to therein shall apply "accordingly. 24 "Where lead, arsenic, or any other poisonous substance is used" by Section 30, it is required that proper washing conveniences shall be provided for persons using such poisonous substances. Section 31 has reference to the regulation of the humidity of the atmosphere in textile factories where the humidity is artificially produced by steaming or other mechanical appliances. That a reasonable temperature should be maintained in each room where persons are employed is an obvious necessity. This is arranged for by Section 82. The compulsory use of fans and artificial ventilation where processes are carried on by which any gas, vapour or other impurity is generated and inhaled by the workers to an injurious extent is made necessary by Section 33. In Section 35 we find "in every place where Section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, is not in force, every factory or "workshop shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation "in the way of sanitary conveniences, having regard to the number of "persons employed in, or in attendance at the factory or workshop, and "also where persons of both sexes are employed or intended to be "employed, or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation for "persons of each sex." Section 41 makes it incumbent upon the occupier of a workshop within twelve months from the commencement of the Act, to notify to the Inspector for the district information as to the name of the workshop, the place where it is situate, the address to which he desires his letters to be addressed, the nature of the work, and the name of the person or firm under which the business of the workshop is carried on. In default a fine not exceeding five pounds will be incurred. Any notice so served shall be forthwith forwarded to the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the workshop is situate. The Act is a useful one, and must be loyally worked in conjunction by local authorities and the Factory Inspectors if all its possibilities are to be utilized to the fullest extent. In concluding this Report it is just and proper that I should acknowledge my indebtedness to my colleagues, Messrs. Turner and Son for their advice and co-operation on very many occasions, and also to your Surveyor for assistance in matters pertaining to his department. Of the loyalty and good work of my own staff I cannot speak too highly. A reference to the numerous Tables which make up the latter part of the Appendix, and a perusal of the Reports with which they have furnished me are sufficient evidence of their enthusiasm, and also of their ability. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. SPECIAL RETURNS Ordered by the Local Government Board.

RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, Inspector. Appointed under the said Acts. 41 Board of Works, Whitechapel District. Public Health Department. To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, The accompanying Tabulated Statement sets out the amount of work carried out by us during the past year. It will be seen that a very large amount of work has been accomplished. In many instances considerable structural alterations to property have taken place. It will also be seen from the said Statement that a very large amount of Reconstruction and improvement of House Drainage has been carried out under our supervision during the year. Very great attention was paid to the question of unwholesome food. Particulars of the Articles seized and destroyed will be found at the foot of the Statement above referred to. Fifty-seven Summonses were issued under the Public Health (London) Act. The Fines and Costs recovered amounted in all to £49 5s. A detailed statement of these summonses we also hand you herewith. Last year we reported that 040 cases of Infectious Disease had occurred, but this year we have to report an increase of 428 cases, making the total for the year 1,074. There were, as will be seen by the Table of Zymotic Diseases for the year, 99 cases of Small-pox. We do not propose making any comment upon the epidemic, but simply draw attention to the fact that in this year's epidemic 13 cases less were notified than was the case in the epidemic of 1893. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. Great inconvenience was caused through insufficient Hospital accommodation during the summer months. In conclusion we have to state that valuable assistance has been rendered us by the two Assistant Inspectors appointed by the Board last spring. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, THOS. P. WRACK, Sanitary GEORGE HARVEY, Inspectors.
