A. , M. B. ,M.R. C. S. ,D. P. H. , Medical Officer of Health. Printed by WATERLOW & SONS LIMITED. S.S.3451. 2. To the MAYOR, ALDERMEN and COUNCILLORS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH of SHOREDITCH Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, The year 1954 has been an interesting and progressive one from the viewpoint of the Borough, and perhaps even more so from the viewpoint of the value of this department to the people in general. While the population has increased by less than 200 as compared with 1953, the number of separately-rated homes has improved by 428, and the rateable value has progressed by more than £8,000, thus indicating an improvement in the physical status of the properties (commercial included) which must reflect an the wellbeing of at least the daytime population. Even so, the (adjusted) birth rate has dropped still further (15.66 to 14.64), though the(adjusted) death rate has more than made amends (13.96 becomes 12.67) despite the continuation of the counting of all deaths in St.Matthew's Hospital as belonging to Shoreditch. The stillbirth rate (21.74) has (perhaps fortunately) now become lower than the infant mortality rate (23.10), and the only infectious disease to produce any deaths was tuberculosis (even this totalled only 12, in all its forms). On the whole therefore, the old dreaded term of "East End" would appear to have lost much of its sting here, in terms of being an unhealthy area (and this at a time when Shoreditch is still singled out as having the least open space of any Borough in London). As if to compensate for the healthier living conditions, some fate ordained that cancer of lungs and stomach, and ulceration of the latter should take a heavier toll than before, and that the other main increases should be in accidents and suicides, but fortunately coronary disease which reared its head high last year reverted to a lower level than before. Of the 17 infant deaths, 12 were shared equally by prematurity, failure of lungs to expand, and chest diseases, four of the others being divided between birth injury and malformation, while the "odd man out" was an unusual one in these days rhesus incompatibility. For the third year in succession no mother died in childbirth. Coincidence decreed that during this year also, one mortuary should be judged sufficient not merely for Bethnal Green and Shoreditch together, but that they should share Poplar's mortuary. The incidence of infectious diseases decidedly improved, there being again no diphtheria, only two polios (already exceeded in the current year), and very little whooping cough. Dysentery and measles were our two main bugbears, but we still hope that the persistent education in handwashing will improve the former in time, I am particularly glad however to be able to report that the notifications of tuberculosis have reached an all-time low level of 48 of all types (against 60 last year).* The Borough Council's Social Services as will be seen in the body of the report (p.20) have spread their net even wider, and are making a great contribution towards producing a happy and healthy group, among the elderly especially. Not only has Club and community spirit spread inside the Borough, 3. but the Council's Holiday Horns has been strained to its utmost for a large part of the year, thanks being due very largely to King Edward's Hospital Fund who have been the means of not only helping financially but also of filling in the gaps in the "off" season (with the support of County and County Borough authorities throughout England). The link between the social services and our remaining hospitals has been as strong as ever, and we could not wish for more co-operation in this direotion. The Royal Chest Hospital finally closed its doors in City Road during the year, and this can readily be understood when one considers the handicaps sustained as a result of considerable war damage. However, our local Chest Clinic in its newquarters is doing such yeoman service that we are confident that while it has even its present amenities it will be able to maintain the improvements already manifested, especially if in future years fewer T.B. patients are imported from other areas than are exported (the reverse applies at the moment). The staff of Sanitary Inspectors has been somewhat depleted during 1954, but early 1955 has shown an even greater drift away from London. As a result of this, the new and extensive work entailed by the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 was shouldered by our hardworking Chief and Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspectors who successfully dealt with 101 applications for certificates of disrepair by the end of the year - none of these being considered spurious. From the viewpoint of the landlords and tenants concerned, this concentration of the work has ensured a uniformity and a specialist attack which makes certain of utter fairness to all (p.26). This relief for the remaining distriot inspectors meant that they were able to keep an even closer watch on food premises and factories, but this present strain must eventually mean a reduction in efficiency in one way or another, unless we can keep fully staffed. The work of slum clearance continues (see p. 36) and further widespread projects have now been almost completely agreed as between the London County Counoil and this Council. The campaigns against rodents and flies have again been very successful, and the free handwashing facilities at public conveniences become more popular. Our deputy chief sanitary inspector, Mr.F.C.Shaw retired (after more than 40 years in Local Government Service) amid the good wishes and thanks of all concerned, and we have welcomed his hardworking suocessor, Mr. T.H.Marshall. I am very grateful to the whole staff for their constant attention to duty, and particularly to Mr.D.Grant, our indefatigable chief sanitary inspector and assistant administrative officer. Lastly, I would like to thank the Council, and particularly the Chairman and members of the Health and Welfare Committees, as well as my colleagues in other departments, for their support during 1954, and to express the hope that we may make even more progress towards "more light, more power" in the coming years. Yours faithfully, B. BROAUBENT Medical Officer of Health. 4. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTER BOROUGH WELFARE COMMITTEE (to May 1954) (to May 1954) Ex-officio: Councillor Mrs. E. E. SMITH, J.P. (Mayor).

The Registrar-General's estimate for the mid-year 1954 population was 45,960, an increase of 190 on the previous year. This figure is used for statistical purposes throughout the report. The density of the population is 69 persons per acre. The Area Comparability Factors for the borough are Births 0.88 and Deaths 1.04, and the rates shown in this report have been adjusted accordingly. BIRTHS. The numbers of registered live births allocated to the Borough during the calendar year 1954 were as follows : Total live births - (legitimate and illegitimate) Males Females 363 Total 765 Illegitimate live births - Males 30 Females 18 Total 48 The birth rate for the borough was 14.64. For England and Wales the birth rate was 15.2 and that for London 15.2. The illegitimate births represented 6.27 per cent of all births in the borough, the figure of England and Wales being 4.6 per cent. STILLBIRTHS. The number of registered stillbirths allocated to the borough was 17 or 2.2 per cent of all births. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages during the year was 454 and the marriage rate was 19.7 per 1,000 population. The marriage rate for the Metropolis was 19.8 and that for England and Wales 15.4. DEATHS. Number of deaths registered in the borough during 1954 - 472 Transferable deaths - Non-residents registered in Shoreditch, 81 Shoreditch residents registered elsewhere, 169 0, The number of deaths debited to Shoreditch is accordingly 560, which gives a nett death rate of 12.69 per 1,000 population. In connection with these deaths 30 inquests were held. The death rate for England & Wales was 11.3 and for London 10.9. Altogether 425 or 75.7 per cent of the people belonging to Shoreditch who died during the year, died in public institutions. The table on page 8 showing causes of deaths at all ages has been supplied by the Registrar-General. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of infants under one year numbered 17 of which 11 were males. These deaths amounted to 3.03 per cent of the total net Shoreditch deaths from all causes, as compared with 2.92 per cent in 1953. The infantile mortality rate (death rate of infants under 1 year per 1,000 live births) for Shoreditch was 23.10, the rate for England and Wales being 25.5 and that for London 22.0. One illegitimate infant died. The number of deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age registered during the y ar was 14, which gives a neo-natal rate of 19.03.

MATERNAL MORTALITY, 1954. No maternal death was recorded during the year. The maternal mortality rates in England and Wales and in Shoreditch during the past seven years are given below:- Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Live and Still Births 1954 1953 1952 1951 1950 1949 1948 England and Wales 0.69 0.76 0.72 0.79 0.86 0.98 1.02 Shoreditch Nil Nil Nil 1.18 Nil 1.13 1.17 CANCER. The deaths from cancer in the Borough during the year numbered 127 as compared with 106 in 1953. BURIAL OF THE DEAD. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is responsible for arranging for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made. During the year 5 burials were carried out. The Council have not yet carried out any cremations, as although it may appear at the time of death that there are no surviving relatives, there is always the remote possibility that at some future date, one may come forward and start enquiries which might result in the Council's action being disputed. III. INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. During the year the number of notifications received (excluding tuberculosis and food poisoning) ras 761, Of these cases 7 were found not to be suffering from the disease stated on the certificate, which gives a corrected number of 754 cases for the year. SMALLPOX AMD VACCINATION. No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year and no vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917. 12.

Bacteriological examinations were undertaken by the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Medical Research Council which is accommodated at County Hall. Record of examinations carried out are as follows:- Nose and Throat Swabs: Negative results 13 Faeces specimens: Shigella Sonnei isolated 317 Salmonella typhi-murium isolated 2 Cl. Welchii isolated 22 Negative results 733 1,074 Swimming bath water examinations 17 Milk samples 17 FOOD POISONING. There was this year, for the first time in several years, one outbreak of food poisoning within the Borough which should be reported, although it produced only one notification here, and was due to Clostridium Welohii in frozen rabbit bought outside the Borough. This outbreak occurred in the modern canteen of a worldfamous firm, and affected 30 members of their staff. One individual oase occurred in a man immediately on his return from a Camp where other cases had been found. This was due to salmonella typhi-murium, but of course the food implicated could not be traced in this instance. 15. IV. - TUBERCULOSIS. Notifications - Forty three new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and five of non-pulmonary tuberculosis were notified during 1954 compared with 55 pulmonary and 5 non-pulmonary notifications in 1953. The following table gives the age grouping of new cases notified. AGE PERIODS FORMAL NOTIFICATIONS.

PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS 1925. These regulations prohibit a person suffering from tuberculosis, and who is in an infectious condition, from following any employment or occupation in connection with a dairy which would involve the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of vessels used for containing milk. No formal action was necessary during the year. MASS MINIATURE RADIOGRAPHY. During 1954 there were no special surveys held actually within the Borough, but the usual flow occurred from many firms and individuals to the unit stationed Just outside the Borough at Golden Lane, E.C.1. However, we are in process of arranging for a wide survey in the Borough during 1955 which should be more productive than anything hitherto attempted here. 18. SHOREDITCH TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE. I am indebted to the Secretary, Miss E.B.Guest, for the following report of Care Work for the year ended 31st December, 1954. "The Shoreditch Tuberculosis Care Committee" continued to function throughout 1954 and, as previously, the Care Fund provided necessary extras, in addition to available statutory help, for patients and their families. The net result of the Christmas Seal Sale (the bulk of our income) was £240.18s.6d. after £12.13s.7d. had been given to the National Association for th6 Prevention of Tuberculosis (i.e. 5% of the net profit, as agreed). Councillors Mr. and Mrs. W. Varnals kindly organised an Old Time Dance on the 29th October, 1954, which raised a net profit of £50 and provided a very pleasant evening both for dancers and onlookers. Further welcome additions to the fund were £40 from the L.C.C. Sunday Cinema Entertainments Fund and £17.10.0 from the United Charities of St.Leonards. Of the earlier means of giving financial help to tuberculous families whioh still remain necessary, fares for relatives to visit patients in Sanatoria and help towards wireless expenses are the two which still appear to require a large share of our money. Again this year patients were sent on holiday through the auspices of the London County Council and the Spero Fund, and it was found possible for our fund to be utilised to defray the expenses of a fortnight's holiday for a child to stay at the same resort as her mother, who went away through official channels. Pocket money at the rate of 7/6d per week was paid to young patients who had commenced work before being taken ill but who had not worked long enough to render them eligible for Health Insurance benefit. This pocket money was continued until they reached sixteen years of age, when the liability was taken over by the National Assistance Board. Some all-wool ex-Government blankets were purchased at a very low oost during the summer and were well appreciated by patients during the winter - whether received as a gift or paid for at cost price by the recipient. Special weekly assistance was given in a case where a single girl has cared for the two sons of her sister, who had died previously, and this will continue, at any rate until the elder boy is fifteen. Two armchairs were purchased for an elderly couple whose only son is a way in a Sanatorium. By this means, although the ohairs are being 19. paid for, the patient and. his parents were able to take advantage of the wholesale terms obtained for them. We are glad to report that the fund does not new have to provide free milk for any of the patients because, during the year, the National Assistance Board agreed that any grant made by the Board for extra nourishment could be utilised for such expensive foods as fish, fruit, etc. The London County Council could, therefore, provide free milk and extra nourishment to all notified cases coming within the scale who were so recommended by the Chest Physician, without duplicating the nourishment given by the Board, and the Care Fund, therefore, does not now have to be utilised for this purpose. We are also pleased to add that the London County Council now supply to such cases, in addition to two pints milk daily, a maximum of seven eggs and ½ lb. butter weekly. As, if they wish, patients may buy the patent foods (Horlicks, Ovaltine, etc.) at a much reduced price through the Care Fund, this change of procedure could mean quite a good increase in the family income. The Divisional Administrative Officer of the London County Council is empowered to grant free milk, etc., in cases above the agreed financial scale, if for any reason it is thought necessary to apply for this. We are pleased to say that in several cases this concession has been granted - sometimes to be entirely free - otherwise the patient to make a small contribution towards the cost. In co-operation with the Shoreditch Borough Council, a Home Library Service was started, books being delivered by the Library Staff to bed patients. This has been much appreciated. The class for patients well enough to attend at the elinic and do handicrafts is continuing under the supervision of a trained Occupational Therapist. The project of sending an Occupational Therapist to the homes of those bed patients considered fit enough by the Chest Physician to do handicrafts there, is under consideration by the London County Council and it is hoped that, by next year, such a scheme may be put into operation. The usual Christmas gifts of 10/- each to twenty elderly patients, and cigarettes to the men in Busby Bird Ward of St.Leonard's Hospital, were provided through the Care Fund. Help has also been gratefully received from other voluntary societies and particularly we wish to thank Miss Glennie of the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association and Miss Heaver of the Forces Help Society, who have done so much for our patients. Below are the figures for Care Work for the year 1954:- Number of oases assisted by Shoreditch Tuberculosis Fund Clothing 38 Fares 83 Pocket Money 3 20.

SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES. The manifold activities mentioned in previous reports continued unabated so that perhaps it will suffice this year to mention the more outstanding items and new ventures. What has proved to be our most successful full-time Old People's Club was opened at temporary premises in Murray Grove during July 1954. So successful has it been, that it has already outgrown the premises concerned, and the Council is hoping to provide larger and permanent quarters near the same spot before my next report appears. The second-hand furniture scheme has proved so successful that I feel that rather more should be said about it. When an old person dies, and the furniture is not required by the relatives, we remove the goods from the premises after an indemnity form has been signed, disinfect it and keep it in store against the time when our welfare visitors or the Sanitary Inspectors find another old person who vitally needs any such articles. During 1954, almost 100 articles were salvaged (including 25 chairs, 4 tables, etc. - and even a sewing machine), while 28 chairs together with tables, settees, food cupboards, etc. (and the sewing machine) were distributed to needy old folk at no oost to anyone, but with great help to the recipients. At one time, the collection became so great that we were able to pass on some to the Seoretary of the T.B. Care Committee, and so help to conserve their funds also. Our Holiday and Rest Home has been at times strained almost to bursting point, especially during the summer months, although the increased charge made during the height of the season has spread the load considerably. The help of King Edward's Hospital Fund for 21. London and County and County Boroughs throughout England has ensured enough winter guests to warrant the retention of full staff throughout the year, though even those recuperating from illness or operation are far fewer in the winter. Redeoorating of Old People's rooms is a most useful innovation this year, and our thanks are due to the "Friends Work Camp Committee" a Quaker group who devote their weekends to cleansing and redecorating the homes of the needy old people in the Borough, (selected by this department). We are also grateful to the local builders and surveyors who have provided the materials needed for this work. The numbers of persons who attended the Shoreditoh Holiday & Rest Home at Copthorne during 1954 were as follows:- Adults 222 10-18 years 12 5-10 years 52 9 months - 5 years 155 Under 9 months 58 Old Age Pensioners 213 Conference members 15 The following table shews the average attendances at the Old People's Clubs during the year (1) (2) (3) Old People's Clubs Average number of attendances Av. weekly No. of Mon, Tues.

It was necessary to take measures on account of the presence of vermin in 87 houses, and in .connection with these 203 rooms were dealt with, sanitary notices being served where necessary. PERSONAL CLEANSING. The arrangement with the Finsbury Borough Council whereby residents of Shoreditch requiring treatment for Scabies or Vermin are sent to that Authority's Cleansing Station at Pine Street, was continued throughout the year. The numbers of treatments carried out are shown in the following tables:- VERMINOUS PERSONS New Cases Total new oases Re- attendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years - 9 9 1 10 SCABIES. New Cases Total new oases Re- attendances Total treatments 0 to 15 years Over 15 years 4 14 18 22 40 (Until school-leavxng age,the L.C.C.treat all affected children at their own Centre). 25. DISINFECTION AND DIS INFESTATION. The number of disinfections of rooms after infectious disease was 139. The number of articles disinfected at the Council's steam disinfector after infectious disease was 1,253. The number of rooms sprayed for verminous condition was 550 and the number of articles treated by steam was 12,139. In addition to the articles disinfected after infectious disease etc., the Public Ha1th Pepartment carried out disinfection of articles for private firms in the Borough, Many countries insist upon an accompanying Certificate of Disinfection as a condition of import of articles such as clothing, blankets, etc. When required, these articles are disinfected at the Council's Disinfecting Station and a charge is made according to bulk or quantity of goods so treated. During the year under review various goods were disinfected for whioh charges amounting to £66.5.0 were made as compared with £12.10.0 for the previous year. During the year 443 families were removed to new housing accommodation on the Borough Council's housing estates. This work entails a considerable amount of additional work for the staff of the Public Health Department as all furniture is disinfested by the Hydrogen Cyanide method by a firm of private contractors under the supervision of the Health Department. When informed by the Housing Department of the families to be removed, it is necessary for an officer of the Public Health Department to ascertain the amount of furniture per family and to make arrangements as to whether one or more families oan be removed in the one furniture van. By this means there is a considerable reduction in the cost of removals. The vans are usually met at 8 a.m. at a rendezvous on the date of removal and it is our duty to see that all the furniture is placed in the van and the tenant given instructions with regard to food as well as seeing that arrangements are made for the reoeption of soft furniture after disinfestation has taken place. When the furniture is loaded on the van it is taken to the Disinfecting Station and the van is sealed and charged with HCN. The whole of the contents are disinfested for approximately four hours, the van is then opened, tested, and when clear of HCN the van moves to the new flat and the furniture is delivered. Soft goods, (that is, bedding, mattresses etc.), which are collected at the same time as the furniture by the Borough Council disinfecting van, are steam disinfected and returned at the same time as the furniture. The next morning the whole of the furniture is tested with a chemical test to make sure that the whole of the HCN has been removed from the furniture and fittings. Much work has been done during the year in connection with the prevention of the breeding of cockroaches and beetles in hot water duots 26. which supply the Council flats. These ducts provide a favourable breeding ground for cockroaches and beetles but an arrangement has been made whereby the Disinfectors of this Department place Insecticide powder in the hot water ducts when they are being constructed, thus killing off any beetles and preventing harbourage for others. This method of control has been proved to be very successful in the past year. To prevent the breeding of flies on putrescible matter which has been deposited on vacant sites by unauthorised persons, many of the sites have been sprayed during the year, 189 articles being removed and 76 sites sprayed. Disinfection of sandpits and public open spaces. By arrangement with the Borough Surveyor the sandpits in the children's playgrounds in the Borough were disinfected with "bleaching powder as a precaution against the spread of infectious disease, particularly poliomyelitis. HOUSING REPAIRS & RENTS ACT., 1954. The above-named Act, which came into force during the year, placed added responsibility and duties on local authorities, particularly in regard to standards of fitness for human habitation and the rent increases in respect of repairs which were allowed to armers under the Act. During the year 101 applications were made on behalf of tenants for Certificates of Disrepair where Notices of Increase of Rent had been served by the owners. The work entailed placed an added burden on the work of the Public Health Department and it was found necessary for the Chief Sanitary Inspector and his Deputy to take this work completely in hand so as to form a standard of defects for the issue of certificates of disrepair where the condition of the premises justified it. The work in connection with this part of the Act meant several visits to premises in order to make sure that the Certificates of Disrepair were accurate. The added work in connection therewith after the Certificates of Disrepair had been issued has also been considerable and included the reinspeotian of work which had been done, with a final inspection where a Certificate of Revocation had been asked for. This work has been most onerous, particularly in view of the shortages of Inspectorial staff. REGISTRATION OF HAIRDRESSERS. Under the London County Council General Powers Act, 1954, the registration of hairdressing premises may be enforced by the Borough Council, and in this connection 46 hairdressing establishments have been registered in the Borough. The Borough Council having decided to make Bye-laws to control these establishments, a higher standard of cleanliness can new be demanded by the Council's sanitary inspectors. The number of visits made during the year was 65. 27. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough is controlled by the Metropolitan Water Board and is relayed from public mains direct to houses. No complaint regarding the quality of the water was received during the year. SWIMMING BATH WATER. There are two Swimming baths in the Borough, one of which is open all the year round, the other during the slimmer months only. During the year seventeen samples of water from the baths were sent for bacteriological examination and seventeen for analytical examination, and all were found to be satisfactory. EXAMINATION OF WATER FROM WELLS . Three wells were in use in Shoreditch during the year, none being used for drinking or domestic purposes. OFFENSIVE TRADE PREMISES. An establishment order under Section 140, Public Health (London) Act, 1936, was renewed during the year in respect of the business of a Fur Skin Dresser. The number of visits made was 4. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Sub-Section (2) of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 requires that in every shop, not being a shop exempt from the provisions of this Sub-Section, there shall be provided and maintained suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences available for the use of persons employed in or about the shop. 28. Sub-Section (6) of Section 38 provides that a shop may be exempted from the provisions of Sub-Section (2) if there is in force a certificate exempting the shop therefrom granted by the authority whose duty it is to enforce those provisions. A certificate is granted if the authority are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances it is not practicable to provide such accommodation on the preaises and that alternative arrangements are conveniently available. 1 Certificate of exemption in respect of sanitary conveniences was issued during the year. The number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 2,734. COMPULSORY REMOVAL OF AGED MP INFIIM PERSONS. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to a Court for an Order for the renoval to hospital or other institution of a person who is aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, and who is living in insanitary conditions and "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention". In addition, during 1951, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act came into force. Under this Act, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and another practitioner, emergency removals of such people for periods not exceeding three weeks may be enforced by the Courts. Powers under these Acts were used in the case of a man aged 81 years who refused either to be helped or to help himself. He was suffering from severe anaemia, was completely blind, and when I saw him, had been 24 hours without food. He occupied a basement room, had only one blanket and was incontinent. He refused to go to hospital although his floctor reoommended he should be removed. An Order was obtained under the Amendment Act and he was removed to St. Matthew's Hospital on the same day - for which he was afterwards grateful. RAG DEALERS. There are 14 premises in the Borough in which the business of Rag Dealer is carried on, 22 visits were paid during the year. 29. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. During the year 378 observations of non-domestic chimneys .in the Borough were made by the Sanitary Inspectors. In all cases where smoke was observed, visits were made to the premises and advice given, and as a result of the calls by the Sanitary Inspectors many remedial measures were effected. The apparatus for daily volumetric measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide began work towards the end of the year (after many delays beyond our control), and figures resulting will be included in future reports. HOUSING -OVERCROWDING AND PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. At the end of 1954 the total number of overcrowded oases on the Public Health Department register was 253, and the number on the medical preferential treatment register was 77. During the year 25 new cases of overcrowding were found and 12 new oases which were recommended for preferential treatment on medical grounds were added to the register, 31 overcrowded families and 8 preferential treatment cases were rehoused. The number of overcrowded cases remaining on the register at the end of the year was 247, and the number on the preferential treatment register was 81. 119 visits of inspection were made during the year. FACTORIES ACT, 1937. The number of Factories on the Register at the end of 1954 was- Power Factories 1,164 Non-Power Factories 142 Total 1,306 During the year 138 factories were added to the Register and 127 deleted, making a nett increase in the number of factories in the Borough of 11. 30.

HOME WORK. During the year 64 lists of outworkers were received from employers in the Borough, 32 in the first half-year due in February, and 32 in the second half-year due in August. These lists contained the names of 1,526 outworkers, of whom 1,147 were not resident in Shoreditch. The addresses of those nonresident were forwarded to the Sanitary Authorities of the 'districts to which they belonged. Lists were also received from 18 other Local Authorities containing the names of 381 outworkers living in Shoreditch and employed by firms outside the Borough. The total number of out-workers reported was therefore 1,907. As has been pointed out in previous reports, in numerous instances names and addresses of outworkers are duplicated owing to lists being sent in twioe a year, and in some cases out-workers are employed by more than one firm, so that the numbers given must not be taken as representing actual numbers of individual workers. The tables on pages 32 and 33 show the distribution of out-workers as regards trades. During the year 302 visits of inspection were made to places where home work was being carried on, but no defect necessitating the service of a sanitary notice was found. 32.

HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. General observation was kept on the sale of heating appliances to ensure that they complied with the Regulations made under the above-named Act and in several cases the sellers and users of heating appliances requested that their guards be tested. The Chief Sanitary Inspector made several tests of appliances at the request of manufacturers and others in the Borough. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. The work in connection with the repression of rats was continued during the year. The whole of the sewer system throughout the Borough was treated and poison baiting was proceeded with twice during the year. The number of complaints received in connection with the common rat had increased but complaints regarding infestations by the black rat decreased compared with last year. In connection with rat infestations 477 drains were treated and of those 87 were found to be defective. Notices were served to remedy the defects found. Last year the use of Warfarin in reducing the rat population was continued and by experience it was found that this method of baiting was efficacious. Previously it was necessary to do pro-baiting for several days with a direct poisoning on the last day, but by the use of Warfar in the work in connection with pro-baiting has been eliminated, thus saving many working hours. The mouse problem this year has been on the increase and the ridding of infestations by mice is a much more difficult one than that for other rodents. The following tables are an indication of the amount of work carried out in connection with the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 - 35. REPORT FOR 1954.

R3(BP) received and charged to business premises from 1st January to 31st December, 1954 amounted to £651,15.0 PI GEONS, During the last few years the nuisance from pigeons has increased. This year permission was granted to a specialist pigeon trapper to trap pigeons causing a nuisance in the Borough, This work is carried out without any charge to the Council and the trapper works under the general direction of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, During the year approximately 90 were destroyed. SLUM CLEARANCE. During the year every local authority was asked to submit a list of houses which they considered representable for slum clearance, and a considerable amount of work of inspection was carried out in this respect. Many meetings were held between the officers of this and other departments and the Sub-Committees of the Council, and eventually a list of houses which we considered to be representable was submitted to the London County Council. 37. In connection with slum clearance, the Committees of the Council have agreed on a suggestion of the officers of this department that where parts of houses or flats in blocks of dwellings which are considered to be representabl* for slum clearance become empty, immediate steps be taken to close them under the Housing Act, 1936, with a view to the prevention of their being relet for human habitation. CLEARANCE AREA. During the year official representation was made under Part III of the Housing Act, 1936, in respect of the following areas- Area No. of houses. No. of persons. Action taken Bevenden Street 13 29 ' Represented and declared a Clearance Area on 23rd February, 1954. Ministry of Housing & Local Government Inquiry held on 31st August, 1954. Order confirmed 30th November, 1954. FOOD HYGIENE. The work in connection with food hygiene was continued throughout the year, and regular inspections of all premises in the Borough where food is handled were carried out. The total number of food-handling premises in the Borough at the end of 1954 was 1,119, as follows:- Cafes and Restaurants 170 Factory and Warehouse Canteens 119 Ico Cream Shops and Manufacturers 175 Milk Shops and Depots 87 Butchers' Shops and Stores 42 Fried Fish Shops 14 Fish Curers 7 Bakehouses 16 Food Factories 12 Food Warehouses 14 Clubs, Schools, etc. 27 Grocery Shops 114 Bakers Shops 23 Confectioners' Shops 75 Greengrocers' Shops 44 Corn Chandlers' Shops 3 Chemists' Shops 22 Public Houses 145 Off Licences 7 Other premises selling mineral waters, etc. 3 1,119 38. It is pleasing to note that an increasing number of food traders are having refrigerators, refrigerated shop windows and display cabinets and frozen food cabinets installed. The installation of these modern methods of storing food ensures that food is stared at the correct temperature, which reduces the rate of growth of food poisoning germs in susceptible foodstuffs. Work in connection with the improvement of W,C. and urinal accommodation at licensed premises was continued during the year and many improvements were carried out, A regular inspection of school kitchens and canteens was made during the year and it was observed that a very high standard with regard to cleanliness and equipment was being maintained. No outbreaks of food poisoning occurred at schools in the borough during the year. The 119 factory and warehouse canteens in the Borough were inspected at regular intervals during the year and a good standard of hygiene maintained. A large new canteen with modern kitchen equipment was opened at the Bishopsgate Goods Station within this Borough, in place of an old canteen previously situated in a part of the station which is outside the boundary of this Borough. We continued the distribution of "Notices to food-handlers and persons employing food-handlers", thus constantly reminding employers and workers of the necessary precautions required to be taken with regard to food hygiene. The simplified leaflet on "safe food service" was also distributed to f oodhandlers and the public at every suitable opportunity. ANTI-FLY CAMPAIGN. The campaign to combat the fly nuisance was continued. By arrangement, and with the co-operation of the Transport and Cleansing Superintendent, all dustbins and dust chutes were dusted during the fly-breeding season with Gammexane after the receptacles had been emptied by the Council's dustmen. Owners of blocks of flats were again encouraged to take action against flies by purchasing insecticide supplied by the Public Health Department at cost price. Fly sprays were also sold to occupiers of food premises. On inspection of food premises in the Borough it was noticeable that infestations by flies were again very slight. Observations were kept on bombed sites and action was taken to prevent putrescible matter, which had been illegally deposited on the sites, from becoming a medium for fly breeding, and many offensive deposits, such as dead cats, dogs and other putresciblo matter were disinfected and removed. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. Free washing facilities are installed in every public sanitary convenience in the Borough, These facilities are being made use of by an increasing number of users of the conveniences and are gradually becoming a regular feature in the use of the public conveniences. 39. The Shoreditch Borough Council may well be proud of the fact that they were one of the pioneers in providing free washing facilities to the public at sanitary conveniences, as it now appears that this facility is being provided more or less on a national basis by other local authorities. The value of free facilities to wash the hands after using the water closet has been proved to be a sound preventative in the transference of infection. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FOOD. 350 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst during the year, giving a rate of 7.6 per 1,000 population. These were as follows Arrowroot 5, Aspirin tablets 5, Bread 6, Butter 5, Cake and pudding mixtures 7, Camphorated oil 4, Cascara sagrada tablets 4, Coffee and chicory essence 4, Confectionery flour 8, Fish paste 14, Herbs, dried 2, Ice cream 6, Iodine, tincture of 5, Jam 10, Marmalade 3, Meat paste 14, Meat products 21, Milk 168, Milk, condensed 14, Mincemeat 12, Paraffin, medicinal 4, Sauce 13, Sausages 3, Soup, canned 10, Stuffing mixture 2, Tea 1.

Warning letters were sent to wholesalers. An informal sample of Tomato Ketchup was found to be tainted and discoloured, but formal sample could not be obtained as no stock remained. Informal samples of Breakfast sausage and faggots were found to contain excessive sulphur dioxide, and pork sausages were found to be deficient of meat. In each case formal samples taken were found to be genuine, A warning letter was sent to the manufacturers of Cascara Sagrada tablets which failed to comply with the disintegration test, UNSOUND FOOD, During the year 516 certificates were issued in respect of food unfit for human consumption, which included the following Meat 369 tins; 7 cwts. 7 qtrs. 1 lb.; Ham 987 tins, 3 qtrs. 18 lbs,; Bacon 16 tons 9 cwts. 2 qtrs. 21 lbs.; Poultry 1 cwt. 4 lbs,; Fish 901 tins; Cereals 10 cwt. 3 qtrs. 17 lbs.; Dried Vegetables 13 cwt, 1 qtr. 8 lbs; Vegetables 339 tins; Fruit 2456 tins, 9 cwt. 11 lbs; Dried Fruit 161 pkts., 11 cwt, 2 qtrs. 17 lbs; Preserves 3 tins, 5 cwt. 3 lbs; Milk 152 tins; Soup 472 tins, 54 pkts.; Mincemeat 52 tins; Cheese 219 pkts,, 6 cwt, 2 qtrs, 14 lbs; Confectionery 95 pkts,, 2 qtrs, 17 lbs; Chocolate 1 cwt, 3 qtrs, 20 lbs; Table jellies 107 pkts; Gelatine 5 cwt. 3 qtrs. 23 lbs; 40.

There are nine premises licensed under the Pet Animals Act, 1951. In three cases a considerable business is carried on, mostly in birds and goldfish. Of the other six, one is a dealer in a few tame mice, two deal in dogs and the other three in pigeons. In these six cases, dealing is done on a very small scale only. During the year 33 inspections were made of these premises, and in no case were the conditions of the licence being contravened, RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. At the end of 1954 the number of registered premises where filling materials are used was 103, and during the year 12 licences were issued in respect of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored, 80 Inspections of the premises were made, 6 Samples of filling materials were takBn and submitted to the Public Analyst.
