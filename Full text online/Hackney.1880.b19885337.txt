HAC 60 Board of works for the District. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOE THE YEAR 1880, by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Member of the Royal College of Physicians, Edin., ; President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health ; Secretary and formerly President of the Meteorological Society; Member of Council of the Society of Public Analysts; Vice-President of the Hackney Microscopical Society; and Foreign Member of the Societe Franchise d'Hygiene; Author of Numerous Essays on Sanitary Statistics, &c.; Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst foe the District. LONDON: A. T. Robehts, Sox & Co., Printers, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1881. REPORT FOR 1880. The extreme prevalence of Small Pox in Hackney during the last ten years, the outbreak again in 1880, after a very limited period of cessation, the great number of cases and the excessive death rate amongst the inhabitants of the streets in the vicinity of the Homerton Small Pox Hospital, induced me to very carefully investigate again, the important question of the influence, if any, on the public health of the district, exercised by the Small Pox Hospital. I therefore collected together all the cases reported to me during the ten years, and re-examined the returns of the District Registrars for the same period, to ascertain the number of deaths, and distributed them amongst the streets and places where the cases and deaths occurred. I have not been able to ascertain the whole of the residences of those who died in hospitals in 1871, but I have done so to a very great extent, so that the tables appended to this Report, whilst fairly representing the whole District, certainly do not overestimate the deaths in the streets occupied by the poorer classes, especially in the vicinity of the Hospital. The increased attention recently bestowed on all infectious diseases, especially as regards their prevention, has probably led many to suppose that the mortality in the Metropolis of late years has been something unprecedented. As this is not the case, I now lay before you a few figures respecting the disease in previous centuries, and also a tabular statement of the annual number of deaths from small pox in London per 100,000 population, since the year 1837. These figures show, as I pointed out several years since, that from 1841 to 1872, inclusive, each epidemic period lasted for 4 years, with two exceptions, viz., for the years 1861, 1862 and 1863, which formed one epidemic period, and the other for 1868—72, which was one year longer than usual. The cause of this tendency to what may be termed a wave lasting for four years in London, cannot be definitely stated, but I 4 scarcely think it can depend to any great extent on atmospheric changes, as the wave periods for all England are longer, each having lasted for 6 or 7 years. Again, the epidemic of 1877-78 formed in the Metropolis, the termination of a six year period, evidently arising from the extremely small mortality that occurred in 1873, 1874 and 1875. The oscillation therefore, appears to me to be partly caused by the larger number of persons susceptible to the disease who are alive in a given number of the population at one time than at another; whilst the number of cases and deaths depends to a very great extent on the proportion amongst the population of unvaccinated or badly vaccinated persons, as compared with those who are protected by proper vaccination and re-vaccination. This part of the subject will be discussed in another part of the Report. TABLE I. LONDON.—Annual Number of Deaths from Small Pox per million population, 1838-80. Years. Deaths per 1,0011,000. Years.

This has been done in the following table, which shows that with the exception of 1838-40 and 1868-72, there has been a much closer average mortality from this disease than might have been expected, 5 TABLE II. LONDON.—Mortality from, Small Pox in groups of years per 1,000,000 population. Years. Deaths. Years. Deaths. Years. Deaths. 1838-40 926 1853-56 243 1868-72 705 1841-44 465 1857-60 221 1873 78 233 1845-48 429 1861-63 297 1879-80 128 1849-52 346 1864-67 322 Table I, shows that the disease was exceedingly fatal in 1838, 1844, 1848, 1863, 1871 and 1877, having produced a death rate in each year, in excess of 700 out of each 1,000,000 inhabitants; that it was epidemic but not so fatal in 1840, 1841, 1845, 1851, 1852, 1855, 1859, 1860, 1866, 1867, 1872, and 1878. There have therefore been 6 periods of excessive mortality from this disease during the 41 years, 1838-78, the two highest being 1838 and 1871, which were separated by a period of 32 years. The years having the smallest death rates were 1850, 1857, 1858, 1861, 1869, and especially 1873, 1874 and 1875, when the mortality was the lowest recorded in any year of this period, and probably the smallest that has ever occurred in London. The reason for these small death rates is evident, viz., that the frightful epidemic of 1871 left comparatively few persons amongst the population who were susceptible to the disease. If we look upon the 34 years 1839—1872, as a greater epidemic wave, and the other epidemics as smaller waves, we get 398 deaths per million population in London, as the mean annual mortality from small pox. This mean when reduced to the more familiar proportion of per 1,000, gives only .398, or not quite one death amongst 2,500 persons. The mean mortality for the ten years 1871-80, was only .460 per 1,000, and therefore not very much above the average, although the immense mortality in 1871 is included amongst the deaths for this period. The table shows that between 1848 and 1871, the mortality from small pox was below the average of the whole 6 period, so that a severe epidemic might have been anticipated about the time it occurred, owing to the large number of persons, especially of the poor, who escaped vaccination in infancy before 1874, and the almost total neglect of re-vaccination, as well as to the number unprotected by a previous attack of the disease. Large as is this mortality of 39.8 per 100,000 population, when we consider the almost total immunity from death afforded by proper re-vaccination, it is as nothing if compared with the death rates which occurred when vaccination was unknown. During the seven years 1629-35, when the disease was not unusually prevalent, the annual death rate in London was 189 per 100,000; in the 20 years 1660-79, it reached the high figure of 417 per 100,000; whilst in the 30 years 1728-57, it had increased to 426. During the ten years 1771-80, just a century before the decennial period 1871-80, the disease caused a mortality of 502 deaths per 100,000 population. From this time the mortality became less, the annual death rate for the ten years 1801-10, having been 204, and for 1831-35, 83 per 100,000 population. During the years 1681-90 and 1746-55, small pox caused one-twelfth of the total number of deaths from all causes.* It is therefore very evident, that as small pox in London increased with the density of the population between 1660 and 1780, but has decreased to one-fifteenth part of what it was in 1771-80, although the density of the population has enormously increased of late years, that some cause for the decline must have been in operation, especially during the last 40 years, and that cause I believe chiefly to be the greater extent to which vaccination has been practised during this latter period. Sad as it is to think that so many lives have been lost even lately for want of proper re-vaccination, yet the glance backwards is certainly one of a reassuring character. During the 10 years 1861-70, comparatively few deaths *See Papers relating to Vaccination, General Board of Health, 1857. 7 were registered in the Hackney District, viz., only 148. It is true that there were a few other deaths in the Highgate Small Pox Hospital, of inhabitants of this District, but I have not been able to ascertain the localities from which these patients were removed, or their number, although I applied to the hospital authorities for permission to inspect the books. As 1505 deaths were registered as having occurred in the Highgate Small Pox Hospital in these 10 years, or just above 18 per cent. of the total number of deaths in the Metropolis from this disease, and as doubtless other than Metropolitan cases are received into that Hospital, I have added for purposes of comparison, one-sixth, or 25 deaths to our total, making 173 in the ten years, or 2.1 per cent. of the total Metropolitan deaths, which were 8,312 in number. During the 10 years 1871-80, there were 15,528 deaths from small pox in London, and as far as I could ascertain from the addresses given in the District Registrar's returns, there were 965 deaths in Hackney, and of these, 912 are tabulated in the Appendix No. 1 to this Report. I could not assign the death to a particular street in all cases, as the District Registrar had omitted the address in many instances where the death had occurred in hospitals. The mortality in 1871 was enormous in this District, having been as high as 3.2 per 1,000 population; the average annual death rate from small pox in 1861-70 having been (after the 25 deaths were added for correction,) only .167 per 1,000; and in the ten years 1871-80, '64 per 1,000, that is to say, about 1 death in each 1,600 inhabitants. In the whole of London, the average annual mortality from this disease in 1861-70, was .276 per 1,000, or more than half as high again as that in Hackney; whilst in 1871-80, it was only .460 per 1,000 population, against .640 in Hackney, showing that this District had suffered nearly half as much again as all London during these 10 years. It is also evident, according to the calculations for 1861-70 and for 1871-80, that small pox was nearly 4 times, or to speak 8 exactly, 3'8 times as fatal in Hackney during 1871-80 as in 1861-70. To put this in a more clear light and avoid the use of decimals, I now give the numbers per 100,000 population for London and Hackney. Deaths from Small Pox per 100,000 inhabitants. London, 1861-70 28 Hackney ,, 17 London, 1871-80 46 Hackney „ 64 The contrast, as regards the two decennial periods, of the annual death rates from this disease was so great, especially on comparing them with those for all London, as to lead to the conclusion that some cause or causes had been in operation during the last 10 years which were not in the former. There is no doubt that the increase during 1871-80 of the poorer population, and the number of small houses somewhat densely inhabited, although scarcely overcrowded, which have been built, must to a small extent have increased the death rate from small pox, as I shall show further on. But this, and as far as I know, no other altered conditions in the District or population, could account to any marked extent for the change. It was necessary therefore to look further, and see if there had been anything new introduced into the District during the last decade, to account for the increased mortality. Now as the only new thing was the opening of the Small Pox Hospital at Homerton in 1871, I shall proceed to test statistically, in the most careful manner, its effects, by the number of cases notified to me during the 10 years 1871-80, and of deaths in 1861-70 and 1871-80; and then assigning them as shewn in the appendix, to the streets in which they occurred. The streets, population, and deaths were divided into groups to calculate the mortality for the disease, with, as I think, the most conclusive results against the Hospital. The total number of deaths from small pox registered 9 amongst the inhabitants of Hackney in 1871-80 was 965, of which I was able to ascertain the addresses of 912. Of these, 651 occurred amongst a mean population of 37,000 poor persons, and 261 amongst 119,400 of the better class inhabitants. The former residents lived in small houses, chiefly occupied by more than one family belonging to the working classes, most of them decidedly poor; whilst the majority of the population lived in better class houses and belonged, at any rate the largest number, to persons possessing all the necessary comforts of life. The contrast between the death rates amongst the two classes, is very striking, especially as the deaths of servants and of employes living at linendrapers and other large establishments, are included amongst those occurring amongst the better class population. On being calculated out, we find that the mortality per annum from small pox for these years was 0.58 per 1,000 for the whole population, or 0.64 when corrected for the deaths of those whose place of abode was unknown, and 1.76 for the poorer population, showing that even when servants and employes living in their employers' houses, were included amongst the better classes, the mortality was three times as great amongst the poor as amongst their more fortunate brethren. This of course might have been expected to some extent, as the poor before 1874 were not properly vaccinated in the same proportion as others; have not the means of isolation in their homes; visit one another indiscriminately; and do not avoid infected houses and persons like the better classes. But these could not account for anything like the whole difference, so that a further sub-division was made with the following results:—a circle of a quarter of a mile radius was struck around the Hospital, taking the middle of the Hospital as the centre, and as the houses and population at the sides and in the front had remained with little alteration during the 10 years, whilst a large number of new houses had been built in the rear of the Fever Hospital, which is placed behind the Small Pox Hospital, the houses first 10 named were alone selected. In these streets there was an average of about 6,823 inhabitants, and amongst them no less than 167 deaths occurred in 1871-80, against 18 in 1861-70, whilst amongst the other 30,177 poor inhabitants outside the quarter of a mile radius, there were 484 deaths; the former giving a death rate per annum of 2'45, and the latter of 1.60 per 1,000 population. The inhabitants of these houses and the houses themselves, were very similar, and differed in no essential points from one another. This excess of mortality amongst those residing within the quarter of a mile radius, becomes something enormous when the population and number of deaths in the streets nearest to the Hospital are compared, as there were no less than 95 deaths during the 10 years amongst a mean population of 2,314 inhabitants, or 4T deaths from small pox per annum in 1,000 population, being a death rate in excess of that ordinarily obtaining before vaccination was practised. These results are the more remarkable as a good many better class persons and tradesmen live in the High Street and in Brooksby's Walk, which form part of the quarter mile circle. The number of cases reported to me, (which are given for each year separately in the appendix,) show very strongly indeed not only the extent to which the inhabitants of these streets were infected, but also the permanence of the infection. In the streets adjoining the Hospital, there were 11.97, say 12 cases per 1,000 population per annum during the last 10 years, and amongst those residing within the quarter mile radius, 9.16 per 1,000 per annum, against 5.76 cases amongst the other 30,177 poor persons. These results may be checked by referring to the appendix, where all the streets within the quarter of a mile radius of the Hospital are marked with an asterisk; the streets adjacent to the Hospital are marked with a dagger. The streets included in the first list, with a few exceptions where the population is not given, are occupied almost entirely by the poorer classes. The following are the measurements showing the 11 distance of parts of the Hospital from the footpath, the houses in the Grove and Brooksby's Walk. The windows of four wards are 24 feet from the wall, say 25 feet from the footpath. Laundry, 10 feet 6 inches; the windows direct the steam downwards. The garden walls of three houses in Brooksby's Walk are only 11 feet from the mortuary. The houses in the Grove are only 48 feet from the laundry, and 60 feet from the windows of four wards. The manner in which the Small Pox epidemic of 1871-72 and 1877-78 broke out in this District, rendered the effect of the Hospital on the inhabitants of the surrounding streets, somewhat doubtful. In the early part of 1870, although a few cases of the disease occurred in other parts of the District, only one case to my knowledge occurred in Homerton before November, when one case was reported in Templar Road, where the disease raged fearfully in 1871. Towards the end of December, a case occurred at 20 Brooksbys Walk, which proved fatal early in January, 1871. There was a second case in the same house, which proved fatal on the 17th January, 1871. There was also a case in Cottage Street, near the Hospital, in November, 1870, but no other case occurred in that street, so far as I know, until after the Hospital was opened. In January, 1871, the disease appeared in various parts of the District, notably in Tottenham Road and Square, in Kingsland, and Fox's Cottages, Morning Lane. A case also happened in Ball's Buildings, which is just outside the quarter mile radius of the Hospital. By the 2nd of February, the disease had acquired a hold all over the District, as 15 cases were reported to me during the week ending January 19th; 11 in the week ending January 26th; and 31 in the week ending February 2nd. Between 19th January and February 2nd, cases were reported to me from Churchill Road, Marian Street, Albert Street, Brooksby's Walk, Rosina Street, Church Terrace, Kings Boad, the Grove, and Princes Road, Homerton; so that the admission of patients to the Hospital 12 clearly did not originate the disease in its vicinity, as these cases occurred before any patients were admitted. This outbreak was not at first severe, single cases occurring in each street, and no excess of cases occurred in the vicinity of the Hospital, as compared with other places, until the week ending March 16th, when the Hospital had been opened for more than a month. During this week, eight cases were reported within the quarter mile radius, and in subsequent weeks the numbers within this radius were as follows:— 3, 10, 2, 13, 6, 8, 5, 9, 6, 8, 4, making a total of 74, against 312 in all the other parts of the District. In the fortnight ending June 29th, there were 23 cases, and in the next fortnight, 17 within this radius, against only 60 in the whole District. After this time, the disease gradually decreased, indeed, with the exception of a limited outbreak in September, it almost disappeared until November, when it again broke out, when a large proportion of cases occurred near the Hospital. Very few cases happened in 1873, 1874 and 1875; but the disease became again epidemic in Hackney in 1876, when 480 cases were reported to me, and 92 deaths registered in that year; the deaths in the whole of London having been only 735, so that one-eighth of all the deaths from Small Pox occurred amongst Hackney parishioners. The table of "cases" shows that a very large number happened in the vicinity of the Hospital, as no less than 13 cases were reported from Brooksby's Walk, 14 from Holmbrook Street, 9 from the Grove, and 11 from Templar Road. The first case in this epidemic (1876, 1877 and 1878,) occurred in July. The patient was a servant living in South Hackney, who had visited a relation suffering from the disease. There was one case in August, which also occurred in South Hackney. The next cases were in Warwick Villas, Homerton, and in Mare Street. On the 26th of September, which was the date of the commencement of the epidemic, three cases occurred in Brooksby's Walk, followed quickly by 13 others which occurred in High Street, Homerton; Clifden Road, Cottage Avenue, Holmbrook Street, and Brooksby's Walk, all within the quarter of a mile radius. A few days later, the disease appeared in Fenn Street and Templar Road. No less than 10 out of 28 cases occurred within the quarter mile radius, and if we include Clifden Road, which is within the radius at the back of the Fever Hospital, there were 12 cases out of 28, in the vicinity of the Hospital. In the week ending October 30th, there were no less than 10 cases in the quarter mile radius, out of 18 cases in the whole District. It is clear therefore, that the disease became epidemic first in the vicinity of the Hospital. The table in the appendix sufficiently shows the after progress of this epidemic, so that I need not trace it further. In 1879, the disease had so much decreased, that only 30 cases came to my knowledge, but out of these, 3 occurred in Brooksby's Walk, in houses adjoining the Hospital. From the date of these cases, not one was reported in the neighbourhood of the Hospital during the whole time it was closed, viz., from September 29th, 1879, to February 8th, 1880, except one case in Brooksby's Walk in October, apparently caught from cases which happened in September; 1 case in Rosina Street, and 1 in Churchill Road, all in October. Cases were reported at intervals from various other parts of the District during November, December and January, but none near the Hospital. On the 14th February, a case occurred in Rosina Street, and a month after the Hospital was re-opened, by the following cases, viz., on March 8th, by one in Holmbrook Street, others on the 22nd and 30th, in the Grove and Templar Road. I need now only specify the number of cases in the streets adjoining the Hospital, in 1879-80, viz., 17 in 1878, 4 in 1879, and no less than 40 in 1880, when the Hospital was not only overcrowded, but when convalescent patients were removed to make room for acute cases. The total number of cases reported to me from the whole District in 1878, 1879 and 1880, were 372, 30, and 363 respectively. 14 As the whole of these facts tend to show that the Hospital did exercise a decidedly prejudicial effect on the public health of the adjoining neighbourhood, the important questions arise:— (1). Is a Small Pox Hospital necessarily injurious to the persons living near it? (2). If not, were there any especial reasons, as regards the Homerton Small Pox Hospital, to account for its injuriousness ? As regards the first, I may say that there is nothing to show that the Small Pox Hospital at Highgate, so far as I can ascertain, is injurious to the public health of the locality in which it is placed. There are also the facts, that a Small Pox Hospital was opened by Mrs. Gladstone at Brook Road, Upper Clapton, and two others by the Guardians of this Parish, both consisting of houses separated only by a few feet from the public footpath. There was also an iron hospital for Small Pox cases, erected on a vacant piece of ground adjoining the two houses at Brook Road, capable of holding with the houses, about 50 patients, and yet only three cases and no death occurred in their vicinity, although there was a row of houses having their back gardens within 30 feet of the iron hospital. In this case there was but little visiting of friends, many of the patients coming from a distance, and I think, at no time were there more than 35 patients in the two houses and the hospital. As to the second query, there is no doubt that the Homerton Hospital is badly placed, being too near the adjoining houses and grounds; the ambulances were not disinfected until after I pointed out this source of danger, and the drivers were in the habit of stopping at publichouses on their way home. The other sources of danger are mentioned in the report of the View Committee on the Hospital. In my report, dated March 24th, 1880, a copy of which was forwarded to the Managers of the Asylums Board, and in a second report, dated December 7th, 1880, (in consequence of which the View Committee was requested to visit the Hospital), I stated that structural alterations 15 were necessary for the protection of the public health. In my report of March 24th, I pointed out the injury arising from the gates being kept shut and children crowding round the ambulance whilst waiting, which had not been altered in December, 1880, when I again reported on the subject. There were comparatively few cases between March and November, which induced me to wait in the hope that as this District had suffered from small pox in 1876-78, the disease would not again become rife before October, 1881, or perhaps later. This speedy recurrence of the disease, contrary to what happened before 1871, is I think another proof that some cause of small pox has been newly introduced into this District. There are two points of considerable importance for consideration, viz., (1), to what extent the infection of small pox can be carned by the air; and (2) how much of the disease is attributable to direct infection by means of ambulances, by visitors and tradespeople going to the Hospital, and by transmission of the sick themselves. As regards the first point, the Infirmary of the City of London Union is placed within 90 feet of the Fever Hospital, which has been used for small pox patients, but no cases of the disease occurred there. The almost complete immunity of the inhabitants in Walsingham Eoad, (only one case having occurred there, and then not in a house adjacent to the hospital,) when the Small Pox Hospital was placed within 34 feet of the back gardens, shows that air flowing from a small hospital is scarcely likely to carry the infection beyond 40 or 50 feet, so that we may fairly assume that if a hospital of this kind and its outbuildings were surrounded by a belt of land of at least 100 feet, there would not be much probability of persons outside becoming infected through the air. On the other hand, the frequency with which the inhabitants of certain houses in Brooksby's Walk and in the Grove, suffered, shows that it is not safe to have a large hospital, laundry or recreation ground for this disease, 16 placed nearer than 90 feet at least from an inhabited dwelling or a public footpath. I attribute the great mortality from this disease in the neighbourhood, as may be supposed from the report of the View Committee, with which I entirely agree, to the stoppage of the ambulances outside the hospital grounds; to allowing children to crowd round them whilst waiting; to the admission of tradespeople into the grounds and corridors, and of visitors to the sick wards; to the insufficient height of the wall surrounding the building; to the nearness of the laundry to the footpath; and the contiguity of the houses in Brooksbys Walk and the Grove. Most of these could be avoided, but it is impossible to shut patients up in a hospital and prevent near relations visiting them when in danger, without much diminishing the utility of these hospitals. I believe there is some danger to the neighbourhood from all hospitals for small pox, to which a large number of patients are admitted, but I think that if not more than from 130 to 150 patients, convalescent and acute cases being counted, be treated in one hospital, and not more than 25 patients be allowed to an acre, the risk would be reduced to a minimum, especially if there be two entrances to the hospital, so as to divide the traffic, and if every other precaution be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. In the present state of the population of London as regards vaccination, I do not think that these hospitals can be dispensed with, but every precaution should be taken to minimise the danger to the residents of the district in which the hospital is placed. I believe it would be convenient, as well as satisfactory to the inhabitants of London generally, if a hospital were provided for each Metropolitan Borough, and if possible, within its own limits, so that each should bear its own burthen and not thrust it on other people. Another point of some importance in connection with these hospitals, is the question whether or not, Small Pox and Fever Hospitals should be established within the same 17 walls. The result of my enquiries undoubtedly is that they should not, unless all communication between the two hospitals be completely cut off. I find that numerous cases of small pox have occurred amongst fever patients, either whilst in the Homerton Fever Hospital, or within 14 days after the discharge of the patient, as deaths in the Fever Hospital have been registered as having arisen from scarlet fever or fever, followed by an attack of small pox, and I also saw several cases of small pox in the Fever Hospital. In the case of the Homerton Hospital, I believe these cases arose from the patients, nurses, and friends being admitted to both hospitals through one gate; and have pointed this out as a source of danger to the inhabitants, not only of this District, but of other localities from which patients are brought. Indeed, nothing I think justifies the use of an entrance common to small pox and fever patients. As schools are often said to be sources of infection during the prevalence of zymotic diseases, I had a house to house visitation made of the streets near the Hospital, for the purpose of enquiring as to the schools which the children attended, and especially as regards Homerton College School and the Homerton Row School, which are the nearest to the Hospital. I was unable to trace any infection in this manner, as the children attended numerous schools, very few comparatively going to either of the above-named schools, as the charges are higher at the Homerton College School and the scholars consist chiefly of the children of persons residing out of the immediate district. In Templar road, from which several of the children came, there were several cases of small pox in the houses in which they lived, but the school children did not in any instance take the disease. I did not expect that this school would prove a source of infection, as it is beyond the distance at which I believe the disease can be carried through the air; and the same applies a fortiori to Homerton Row School and the Homerton Training College, which are at a greater distance still. It 18 must not however be supposed from what I have just stated that I do not consider schools to act as sources of infection, because there is no doubt that they do, but then it is by direct infection from one scholar to another. The source of the infection could be traced in a few cases only. I alluded in my last report, to a child who was living in a locality in which there were no small pox cases, and who was attacked with the disease within 14 days after receiving a cake and a book which were sent to her by a person who was recovering from small pox. Several workmen in this District have been attacked after working at the Deptford Hospital, or in private houses which were infected by small pox patients. In one instance, a woman went to visit her sister, but on the street door being opened, she noticed an unpleasant smell, did not enter the house, and was attacked with premonitory symptoms in 12 days, and died six days afterwards. As a female attending on the patient opened the door, it may have been communicated to her, not by the air of the house, but by the clothes of the nurse. In one notable instance, an infected child was retained in a house where there were three families, three of the children being unvaccinated. One of the children was removed to a distance and had the premonitory symptoms of small pox, followed by the rash, 18 days after removal, there not being any small pox in the neighbourhood. The whole of the children in the house took the disease, and we traced more than 20 cases to infection from the child first attacked. There were many other similar instances of children being retained in small houses and treated by medical practitioners, although the houses were quite unfit for isolation of the disease, and no information was given to me, and consequently no disinfection was carried out until the disease had attacked other persons. There seems also to be a great objection to re-vaccination on the part of many medical men, as well as of the public, as I rarely find that the inhabitants of infected houses are re-vaccinated, although 19 a circular note is left at each house by the Inspector in charge of the disinfection, pointing out the protection afforded by this simple operation. I have also had nearly 6,000 handbills distributed amongst the poor, through the clergy, district visitors, masters of the School Board and other elementary schools. If I had received early notification of the existence of small pox, especially amongst the poor, I could have taken measures in many cases by disinfection, and perhaps, compulsory isolation for preventing of the spread of the disease. Amongst the 800 cases reported to me between August 1st, 1880, and the end of May, 1881, when this part of my report was written, I found that 602 patients had been vaccinated, 90 were unvaccinated, and no information could be obtained respecting the vaccination of 108, very many of the latter being servants. I would remark here on the very large number of instances in which servants were the only members of a family affected, whilst it frequently happened that two or more children were attacked simultaneously in poor localities, especially when attending the School Board's schools. There were comparatively few children under five years of age, attacked during this epidemic, as compared with 1871-72, or even with 1877-78; but there was a very large number between 5 and 15, viz., 25 per cent. of the whole. There was a very large proportion of cases under 15 years amongst the vaccinated, which shows that re-vaccination to be at all effectual in stopping the spread of small pox, should generally be performed at an earlier age than 15 years. If however, there should be three or four good marks, it might be deferred to 15 years. I have seen a large number of small pox patients in the hospital and elsewhere, and am convinced that in very many instances, vaccination has been very carelessly performed, and has not afforded proper protection against an attack. It is also necessary that as much care should be taken in re-vaccination as in primary vaccination, both as regards the lymph and prevention of damage to the vesicles. If a person have been re-vaccinated 20 without result, it does not follow that he is insusceptible to small pox, as it frequently happens that when re.vaccination has failed, say at 20 years of age, it succeeds at 25, or some later period of life. Cases of Small Pox at different ages among the Vaccinated.

The questions then arise,—was vaccination more effectually performed, or was the lymph of better protective power 30 years ago and previously to that time, or is there a larger proportion of re-vaccinated persons amongst those who are more than 30 years, than amongst younger persons? There is however another proposition, viz.,—do persons become less susceptible to this disease as age advances ? I must leave the answers to these questions for others to solve. I have mentioned 30 years as the probable age at which fewer persons are proportionately attacked, but it may be later, as at 25.45 years of age the proportion of cases is nearly the same as the percentage of population. I have already mentioned that there were 90 cases amongst unvaccinated persons, against 602 said to have been vaccinated. This seems to be a very large number when we consider that it is not probable that there are more, if so many as 5 per cent. of the entire population, who have not either been vaccinated or had small pox. If this assumption be correct, there would be a little more than 9,000 persons in the Hackney District, who were unvaccinated, against 177,000 who were vaccinated, which would give about 1 per cent. of attacks amongst the unvaccinated, and 0.34 per 23 In accordance with a desire expressed by the Sanitary Committee, I submit the following memorandum on the efficacy of Vaccination and Re-vaccination, which contains in addition to other statistics, some which have been used in a former part of the report. In considering this question, it must be borne in mind, that it is probable that at least 95 per cent. of the population has either been vaccinated or had small pox, and that therefore there are less than 5 per cent. who have not been vaccinated or suffered from small pox In 1877, only 3.69 per cent. of the Recruits for the Army and Navy had neither vaccination nor small pox marks, thus affording strong corroboration of the above mentioned estimate. To show the contrast between the mortality from small pox before vaccination was introduced, I will submit the following for your consideration. During the seven years 1629-35, the annual death-rate in London was 189 per 100,000 population; in the 20 years 1660-79 it reached the high figure of 417 per 100,000; whilst in the 30 years 1728-57, it had increased to 426. During the 10 years 1771-80, just a century before the decennial period 1871-80, the disease caused a mortality of 502 deaths per 100,000 population, or more than 15 times as many as for the period 1839-72, and 11 times as many as in 1871-80, when under the influence of two severe epidemics, it caused 46 deaths a year per 100,000 population. I would also mention that during the years 1681-90, and 1746-55, small pox caused one-twelfth of the total number of deaths from all causes. As the figures just given refer to periods during which vaccination was not practiced, it may be as well to give similar returns for late years. During the 34 years 1839-72 which I consider to constitute a greater wave-period of small pox; there were rather less than 40 deaths per annum to each 100,000 population in London, against 502 in 1771-80. In the periods 1853-56, the annual death-rate was 24, in 1859-60, 22; in 1861-63, 29; in 1864-67, 32; in 1868- 24 72, 71; in 1873-78, 23; and in 1879-80, 13 per 100,000 population in London. As the population of London is enormously larger now than in the 17th and 18th centuries, and pro rata to population, infectious diseases are usually more fatal amongst large than small communities, we should have expected the death-rate from small pox to have increased up to the present time, as it did between 1629-35 and 1771-80, instead of showing the great decrease just mentioned; and I therefore attribute this change chiefly to vaccination. If from simple death-rates we pass on to consider the relative mortality amongst vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, and the proportion which the unvaccinated cases bear to the vaccinated, we shall obtain the strongest evidence in favour of vaccination. During the 8 years 1871-78, there were admitted into the Small Pox Hospital at Homerton, 6,553 cases; of these, 1,626 bore one or more good marks, 2,657 had only imperfect marks, and in 793 persons, there was no evidence of vaccination, although the patients stated that they had been vaccinated. There were also 1,477 unvaccinated persons admitted. Now as before stated, there are probably only about 5 per cent. of the population who have not had small pox or who are unvaccinated, whilst the proportion of unvaccinated persons admitted was above 22 per cent. of the whole, it is therefore quite clear, when the number from whom the unvaccinated were drawn is taken into consideration, that the unvaccinated are far more susceptible to small pox than the vaccinated. The death rates of those admitted are less liable to dispute, as (or) amongst those having good marks, the death rate was only 3.32 per cent.; (b) of those having indifferent marks, the death rate was 11.10 per cent.; (c) whilst of those who stated that they had been vaccinated, but on whom no marks could be found, the death rate was as high as 27.23 per cent.; and lastly, amongst the unvaccinated, the death rate reached the enormous figure of 45.76 per cent. The 25 experience derived from this hospital is borne out by that obtained from other hospitals. There is also another strong piece of evidence afforded by hospitals, viz., that the attendants when re-vaccinated never caught the disease, whilst a few who escaped re-vaccination, contracted it. It has been objected, that if vaccination affords so great a protection against small pox, how is it that so many vaccinated persons take the disease ? The answer is readily given: (a) before the now almost usual custom of arm to arm vaccination was generally carried out, there was very much bad vaccination, and persons were consequently imperfectly protected; (b) because the number of insertions of lymph are often too few; (c) because experience of late epidemics has shown that early re-vaccination is necessary in consequence of the protective power of the lymph wearing out during growth; and (d) because re-vaccination is comparatively rarely practised, although experience shows that persons properly re-vaccinated after the cessation of growth, rarely contract small pox, and if they do, almost invariably suffer only from a very slight form of the disease. As regards re-vaccination, the experience derived from enquiries made respecting the patients reported to this department, shows that a very large number of vaccinated children take small pox between the ages of 7 and 10 years, and a greater number between 10 and 15; as many as 30 per cent. of all the vaccinated cases of small pox, having occurred in children under 15 years of age. It is therefore evident, that it is necessary for re-vaccination to be performed as early as 7 years of age, unless the child be protected by four good marks. One great obstacle to early re-vaccination is, that the public vaccinators are not paid out of the public funds for re-vaccination under 15 years of age, except during an epidemic, when the age may be altered to 12 years by a Special Order in Council. The efficacy of efficient re-vaccination is shown not only by the statistics of Small Pox Hospitals, but in other ways. 26 Thus, in 1878 there were but 9 cases of small pox in the whole of the British Navy, numbering about 46,000 men, and all these cases were mild, none being fatal. The naval instructions are that all men who have not been re-vaccinated after entering the service, shall be re-vaccinated as soon after 18 years of age as possible, notwithstanding that they may have good marks, or have had small pox. Dr. Walter Lewis, chief medical officer to the General Post Office, also states that during the 10 years 1870-79, there was not a single death from small pox, and only 10 slight cases amongst an average of 10,504 persons employed; whilst in the Telegraph Department, 12 cases occurred in the same period, amongst an average of 1,458 persons. All the Post Office employees were re-vaccinated on admission, unless the operation had been performed within 7 years; whilst the rule was not so strictly observed as regards the Telegraph staff. During the 18 years 1859-76, the mortality from small pox amongst the troops stationed at home, was about 1 per annum amongst each 18,000 soldiers. There is one point in connection with re-vaccination that is often lost sight of, viz., that susceptibility to the action of the lymph varies in the same person at different periods of life, so that nonsuccess of re-vaccination, say at 20, does not prove that the operation will not succeed at 30 or 40. This renewed susceptibility to vaccination, corresponds to the renewed susceptibility to small pox after an individual has suffered from an attack of this disease, and probably occurs in about the same ratio amongst both these classes. In concluding this part of my subject, I propose submitting the most important facts as regards the mortality from small pox, in a tabular form. London.—Annual number of Deaths from Small Pox, per 100,000 inhabitants. 7 years, 1629-35 189 10 years, 1871-80 46 20 years, 1660-79 417 8 years, 1873-80 17 30 years, 1728-57 426 33 years, 1839-72 40 10 years, 1771-80 502 27 An important matter little understood by the public, is the number of days after exposure to small pox, when vaccination will either prevent or modify the disease. As the incubative stage of small pox, that is to say the period during which the disease does not ordinarily produce constitutional symptoms, is about 12 days, it follows that " suppose an unvaccinated person should inhale the germ of small pox on a Monday, if he be vaccinated as late as the following Wednesday, the vaccination will be in time to prevent the disease being developed: if it be put off until the Thursday, the small pox will appear, but be modified; but if it be delayed until the Friday, the vaccination will be of no use."* The same applies to re-vaccination, so that if a person should unfortunately be exposed to the infection of small pox, he should be vaccinated as quickly as possible. If a case occur in a house, all the unvaccinated and those above 7 years who have not been successfully re-vaccinated, should have the slight operation performed forthwith; for even if too late to prevent the development of the disease, it may modify the attack; because, although some days might have elapsed after the appearance of the disease in a house, it does not follow that all the residents were infected on the first day, or that they were infected at all. It must not however be supposed that the incubative period of small pox is always 12 days, because it is sometimes a day or two greater or less than this period. In concluding my account of the small pox epidemic, I think it will be useful to append a diagram, reproduced on a somewhat larger scale from the Registrar General's Report, 1881, of the deaths from this disease in London during the 40 years ending December 31st, 1879. It does not show the absolute number of deaths in any given week, but that small pox causes a number of deaths in excess of the mean, from the second week in December to the second week in July, and that the average death rate from this disease is * Marson on Small Pox, in Reynolds' System of Medicine, vol. I. 28 29 below the mean from the early part of the second week in July to the second week in December. Also that the greatest number of deaths occur during the third week in January and the first of February, and that after a fall until near the end of March, it rises again to the end of the third week in April, and remains at a high point, with a temporary fall, up to the last week in May. At the commencement of an epidemic, the rise often continues later than the end of May, and the sharp decline does not occur until the middle of June, or even a little later. The period however varies considerably, as in 1871 the greatest number of deaths occurred in the eighteenth week, and therefore it is not to be assumed that the curve described by the deaths during a large number of years, is that which will occur in any given year. The admissions into the Small Pox Hospitals, correspond pretty closely with the deaths, except that as might be expected, the curve rises above the mean line in November instead of December, and the curves are more irregular owing to the shortness of the period during which these hospitals have been open. I have not therefore reproduced the diagram of the cases of small pox from the Registrar General's Report, as I have of the deaths. I would also mention that the curve described by the deaths from small pox in New York, much resembles that for London, but is more smooth, the rise in January and February being continuous up to the middle of the month and then declining to the middle of March, rising again gradually to the middle of May, and then falling regularly but sharply to the end of September. The rise in May is higher, being nearly 70 per cent. above the mean against 40 for London, and the depression is also nearly 70 per cent. below the mean against 40 for London. 30 SMALL POX CASES.

Fortunately, I had calculated the population within about 400, so that none of my figures previously printed, except for last year, require any alteration. Through the courtesy of Mr. Godwin, the Superintendent Registrar of the District, I am now able to give those statistics, and, for the purpose of comparison, I have added the number of inhabitants and of inhabited houses for 1871. It is, however, as well to mention that although some of the figures for 1881 may not be quite correct, they are so for all practical purposes. TABLE I. Hackney Population and Inhabited Houses. 1871 and 1881. Sub-Districts. Population. Inhabited Houses. 1871 1881 Increase. 1871 1881 ase.

The increase in the other Sub-Districts was much smaller, but in all except Stamford Hill, it amounted to a substantial number. In proportion, however, to the population of 1871, the largest addition to the inhabitants of any Sub-District has occurred in Stoke Newington, as we find that in 1871 41 there were only 9,841, while in 1881 there are 22,780 persons in that parish. The total increase for the whole District is 6l,449. There is an almost corresponding addition to the number of inhabited houses, as there were 27,503 in 1881 against 19,367 in 1871, or an excess of 8,156 houses. The number of persons in each house has increased from 6.46 to 6.77 for the whole District, but it varies in each Sub-District, as there are 6.89 persons per house in Hackney, 6.93 in South Hackney, 6.80 in West Hackney, 6.05 in Stamford Hill, and 6.42 in Stoke Newington. The increase is not satisfactory in a sanitary point of view, as infectious and other diseases usually become more prevalent as the density of population increases; but it is satisfactory to find that the death rate of the District was only 19.6 per 1000 population in 1871-80 against 20.37 in 1861-70, and has therefore decreased instead of increased, as might have been expected.

Having already referred to the very large increase in the number of inhabitants, I need only remark that it amounts to 42 nearly 50 per cent. over the population of 1871. The density of population is also becoming greater, it having been on July 1, 1880, as high as 46.2 persons to an acre; indeed, it is considerably larger, as there are only 3,367 acres which can be built upon out of the 3,935 of which the District consists. Of the 568 acres, there are 345 which are practically outside the District, viz., the Hackney Marshes, which divide Clapton from the County of Essex. The real density of our population is, therefore, 50.5 per acre. The births have increased in a slightly greater ratio than the population, but the marriages have proportionately decreased, only 1,425 having been celebrated in 1880 against 1,278 in 1872. This would indicate a considerable increase in the number of married persons coming to reside in the District, especially as the number of births per 1,000 population was 35.6 in 1880, against only 33.2 in 1871. The increased birth rate to a certain extent accounts for the low death rate, as .we must have a larger proportion than in all London of young persons and children above 10 years of age in our midst, whose death rate per 1,000 is not so high as amongst middle aged and elderly people.

There were as many as 796 registered in Stoke Newington, 43 or 12.2 per cent. of the total number for the whole District against 7.6 in 1871. These numbers are singularly close, and show that the birth rate may be fairly used, as I have done, to check off the calculated population during the intervals of each census. In Stamford Hill Ward the percentages of population to the total number of residents, and of births to the total births in the District were precisely the same, viz., 4.9 per cent. In West Hackney the ratio does not correspond so closely, as the births in 1880 were 21.1 per cent. of the whole, and the population in 1881, 20.2. In the Hackney Sub-District, in consequence of the Small-pox and Fever Hospitals, the German Hospital, the Hackney Union Workhouse, and the City Union being within its limits, the birth rate in 1880 was only 39.4 per cent. of the total births, whilst the population was 41.2. This virtually corresponds with the rates for 1871. In South Hackney the births were 22.3 per cent. and population 21.5, showing a rather smaller proportion of births than in 1871. I have dwelt upon these rates with some emphasis, as they have partly guided me in calculating the population of the District. In my report for 1879, I stated that the estimated population gave 35.9 births per 1,000 population, the true number being 36.0. TABLE IV. Deaths Registered in each Sub-District of Hackney, 1880.

It is quite evident that to place merely crude numbers in the table and treat them as being available for purposes of comparison with one another would be utterly misleading, as the German, Fever, and Small-pox Hospitals, as well as the Union Workhouse and City of London Union are situated in Hackney Sub-District. I have, therefore, assigned the deaths in the Fever, Smallpox and German Hospitals, of inhabitants to the SubDistricts from which the persons were brought, and divided the other deaths pro rata to population, amongst the SubDistricts, deducting of course those so assigned from the other deaths registered in the Hackney Sub-District. I have included all the deaths of non-parishioners in the German Hospital, in the Lunatic Asylums, and in the River Lea amongst the deaths for the whole District, as these, with the deaths of parishioners in the Fever, Small-pox and German Hospitals make up about our proportionate mortality in the other London Hospitals. Indeed, from the returns I have obtained, I think I have added on too many. The corrected deaths for each Sub-District corresponds pretty closely with the population, in Stamford Hill, West Hackney and South Hackney Sub-Districts, being somewhat larger in each, but the percentage of deaths was below the percentage of population to a rather large extent in Stoke Newington. This arises to a great extent from the comparative absence of poor in Stoke Newington Parish, 45 TABLE V.

There was an exceptionally large mortality from small pox, whooping cough and diarrhoea. The proportion from constitutional causes was somewhat less than usual, but did not differ much from the average, indeed, in no one class was the deaths unusually large. The mortality amongst children was decidedly high as 27.7 per cent. of the total deaths occurred amongst infants under 1 year old, and 171 per cent. between 1 and 5 years of age, making a total mortality of 44.8 per cent. of the deaths under 5 years of age, the average for 1866-75 being 40 per cent. These deaths were caused chiefly by scarlet fever, diarrhoea and especially whooping cough. The number of deaths between 5 and 35 was less than usual. The diminution 46 in the mortality from " local diseases " arose chiefly from the reduced number of deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs which was so fatal in 1879, but this was partially counteracted by the large number of deaths from brain diseases. Although the deaths above 85 were not so many as usual, yet the number of those who died above 80 years of age was somewhat in excess of the average, as 99 deaths between 80 and 85 were registered during the year, against 74 in 1879. There were 30 deaths registered between 80 and 81 years of age; 23 between 81 and 82; 16 between 82 and 83; 13 between 83 and 84; 17 between 84 and 85. After that age the number diminished rapidly, 10 deaths only having been registered between 85 and 86 years of age; 11 between 86 and 87; 3 between 87 and 88; 9 between 88 and 89; 11 between 89 and 90; 8 between 90 and 91; 1 each between 91-2 and 92-3; 2 at 93-4; 1 between 94 and 95; 1 between 95 and 96; and 1 at the very unusual age of 104 years. This last named death occurred at such an advanced period of life, that I made special enquiries concerning it, and ascertained that the deceased was a Jew, a general dealer, who was born in July, 1775, and died in June, 1880, from paralysis, at the Jews' Asylum, in Well Street, South Hackney.

In 20 large towns, the annual rate of mortality from these affections was 4'0; in all London, 3.7; and in Hackney 3.37 per 1,000 population, which is decidedly satisfactory. The death rate from tubercular diseases was also less than usual, having been 2'51 per 1,000 inhabitants, whilst those from pulmonary diseases, (except consumption,) were above the mean, although they did not equal the mortality of 1879. Convulsive and wasting diseases of infants were also rather in excess of the average. TABLE VII. Deaths from the Seven Chief Zymotic Diseases in 1870-79, in Hackney.

There was also a very small mortality from this disease in 1879. The number of deaths from measles did not differ so much, the smallest in 1876 having been 15, whilst the highest in the following year was 91. The number of deaths from scarlet fever has varied more, the largest (181,) having been recorded in 1870, and the smallest (27,) in 1873. Whooping cough has been unusually fatal for the last 3 years, 135, 110 and 141 deaths having been registered in these years. Diarrhoea, after an unusually small mortality in 1879, caused a great number of deaths, viz., 170, which gives the largest death rate since 1863. The mean annual number of deaths for the 10 years 1870.79, from these diseases per 10,000 population was 36.1, against 41.3 for all London; but the proportion in 1880 was not so large, having been 28'88 for Hackney, and 32 96 for all London. During this year, the percentage of deaths from these diseases was 15.6 in Hackney, against 15.3 for all London. The close approximation in these rates was caused by the large mortality in Hackney from small pox, 49 whooping cough and diarrhoea; small pox having caused 38 deaths, scarlet fever nearly 45, whooping cough as many as 78, and diarrhoea the very large proportion of 94 deaths per 100,000 population.

In 1880 the births were 6,462 and the deaths 3,321. The proportion of births to deaths has been, with the exception of 1875, increasing almost year by year, the average for the ten years 1871-80 having been 176, against 156 in 1861-71, 159 in 1851-61, and 146 in 1841-51. In 1879 there were 192 and in 1880 194 births to each 100 deaths. The proportion of births to 1000 population has also increased, having been 34.7 in the ten years 1871-80, against 33'8, 31'8 and 28.3 in each preceding decennium. A comparison between the number of deaths under 1 year and the number of births is equally satisfactory, as for the ten years 1871-80 it was 142, against 143 in 1861-70, and also against 158 for all London. Considering the enormous increase of our population, and especially the large number of poor located in the new houses at Hackney Wick and Clapton Park, this is very satisfactory evidence of the salubrity of this district. The death-rate per 1000 population is also reassuring, as in 1880 it was only 18.3, against 19.6 for 1871-80; 20.4 for 1861-70; 19.1 for 1851-61, and 19.2 for 1841-51. The death-rate in Hackney per 1000 population from the seven chief zymotic diseases accords with the other statistics, as in 1880 there were only 2'89 deaths from these maladies, against 3.7 for all London and 3.24 for all England. The means for the ten years 1871-80 were 3.40 in Hackney, 3.87 in all London, and 3'33 in all England. In former years the statistics appeared more favorable, but they were not so accurate as those for the last ten years, because the deaths from small pox at Highgate were not included in our death-rate, except in the allowance for deaths in all the Metropolitan Hospitals. 51 During the year a gas pressure guage has been placed in ray office with very satisfactory results, as it indicates the pressure to have been in excess of that required by Act of Parliament for the whole year. Indeed, during the time that gas is ordinarily used in houses and shops, the pressure is very considerably greater than the required amount, so that if care be not used in regulating the pressure by a stopcock on the pipe supplying the meter, an unnecessary quantity of gas will frequently be burned. As pointed out in a previous report, the light given off for each cubic foot of gas burnt, will depend to a very great extent on the kind of burner employed and the frequency with which it is changed. The smallest pressure recorded during the year was 9-tenths of an inch, the required pressure being not less than 6-tenths of an inch, which is satisfactory. At night, between dark and 11 o'clock, the pressure was usually above 25-tenths. The number of requests to remove dust and house refuse from the houses of the inhabitants, and of complaints of inattention on the part of the men, were rather more numerous than usual. These arose from a temporary inspector being appointed to attend to the duties during the fatal illness of Mr. Flanders, which lasted for several months. The number was 2,639, against 2,296 in 1879, which, considering the extent of the District and the number of houses, is by no means large; especially as many persons will not place a D card in their windows, but prefer sending a request for removal to the office. The total cost was £2,717 5s, 10d., and the number of loads removed was 9,785 in Mr. Stevens' District, and 10,511 in Mr. Jackson's, making a total of 20,296 loads. This compares very favourably with other Metropolitan Districts, as it amounts to only 2s. 8d. per load of 60 cubic feet. In consequence of complaints having been made to me respecting offensive emanations from the gullies and ventilating apertures in Wick Road, and of very unpleasant 52 odours observed at Clapton, I inspected every manufactory which communicated with our sewers, without finding any process that could account for them. I visited Berger's manufactory also, and was told that nothing deleterious was poured into the Metropolitan Board of Works' sewer, although I had reason to believe that the smells arose from the intermixture of some waste from their manufactory and the sewage. An offensive liquid was occasionally poured into our sewer at High Hill Ferry, containing lime used for purifying methylated spirit, but there was no smell in the distilling house. I advised the use of a tank to allow the suspended matter to subside before letting the liquid run into our sewer, and the use of a syphon to empty the tank. These have been done, and I have received only one complaint since. Notices have also been served on several persons occupying premises upon which noxious trades were carried on ; notably, two who prepared skins for sausages, and a wholesale dealer in pickles. The whole of these were removed from the District in consequence of the action taken against them. A summons was also taken out against the occupier of a wharf, for allowing dust, refuse and manure to accumulate so as to be a nuisance, and an order was obtained for its removal. Another summons was taken out against a broker for removing goods and bedding without previous disinfection from a house in which several cases of scarlatina had occurred, when a penalty of £3 was inflicted. A summons was also taken out against an owner of seven houses which opened on to a yard common to all the occupiers, for not properly paving and draining the same. An order was made on the owner to do the necessary work in 14 days. Orders were also obtained for putting several houses into tenantable condition, or for shutting them up; and in these cases also the owners did the necessary work. A summons was also taken out against the owner of a workshop, for not providing proper privy (water-closet) 53 accommodation for his men, when an order was made upon him to do the necessary work. The usual inspections of the cow-sheds and slaughterhouses were made in company with the View Committee, when the sheds were found in a much better condition than usual. It was however necessary to oppose Mr. Parsons, of Barn Street, Stoke Newington, for keeping the premises generally in a filthy state, and for not providing proper paving and a dung pit. After an adjournment of four weeks the license was granted, as everything had been done to our satisfaction. The following occupiers of cow-sheds were opposed at the Prescott Street Sessions, for not complying with the notices served on them for repairs or alterations to the sheds, viz., Messrs. Reynolds, Page, Childs, Alieson, Whitby, Blurton Boad, and Whitby, Bay Street, Corp, Jones, Southgate Boad, and Jones, Mayfield Street; Morgan; James, Downham Boad, and Wise, Shrubland Boad. The applications for renewal of their licenses were adjourned for a month to enable the occupiers of the sheds to carry out the necessary work, except in the cases of Childs, in Lauriston Boad, and Streete, John Street, Shacldewell, whose applications were refused. The first, because he would not alter the shed according to our revised regulations, copy of which had been served four months before; and the second for habitually keeping his premises in a filthy state, so as to be a nuisance. At the adjourned Sessions, all the licenses were renewed, except these just mentioned, as the works were substantially carried out. Two applications to establish anew the business of a slaughterer of cattle, were objected to, as the proposed slaughter-houses were in crowded neighbourhoods and too near to dwelling houses. Several notices given here for the erection of new cowsheds were also objected to in consequence of the sites being situated in crowded neighbourhoods, and too near to 54 inhabited dwellings. The regulation that no cowshed shall be newly erected if any part thereof shall be within twenty feet of a house has been rigorously enforced, and, as I believe, with good results. The amount of work in carrying out the inspections and deciding about the regulations, and their application to particular premises, may be judged of by the fact that the View Committee held 15 meetings during the year, and that I not only accompanied them in all their inspections, but visited several of the places on other occasions. During the year complaints have been made to me respecting the discharge of black smoke from the chimnies of furnaces, and in all cases it was found that a proper smoke consuming apparatus was not fitted to the fire place or furnace. One case was that of an upright boiler, used for working a small steam engine; another where six small furnaces were used in a chemical manufactory, and others of a similar character. In all instances the nuisance was abated by the addition of a proper apparatus to the furnaces, and the use of proper fuel. I also visited several places where it was proposed to newly establish offensive businesses, and succeeded in inducing the persons to go elsewhere, as I do not think that a district like Hackney should have these trades introduced amongst the inhabitants. Several complaints were also received during the year respecting the burning of clay for ballast in the vicinity of Bethune Road, Stoke Newington. I paid several visits to the spot, and induced the builders to discontinue the practice after the heaps then burning were completed. I also made a special examination of the drainage of the houses in this road, and found some slight defects, which were altered so as no longer to be an annoyance. I have also given much consideration and time to the subject of the offensive smell arising from the Wick Eoad Sewer. The number of houses occupied by the poorer classes, 55 inspected during the year, amounted to 6,197. The number of rooms inspected and reported upon was 25,862, and of families residing in them 9,759. The residents were returned as being 36,480, or less than 6 per house, the average for the whole District being 6'77 per house, so that probably the returns made to the Inspectors are a little too small. There were no less than 2,168 of these houses upon which nuisances were found, which is a rather smaller number than usual. The details concerning the whole of the nuisances dealt with during the year are given in the Appendix, from which it appears that the total from defective means of drainage amounted to 1,158 ; that 301 yards were repaved, 327 new dust bins were provided, 1,946 houses were whitewashed, cleansed, and repaired, and a better water supply or apparatus provided in 526. There were 573 houses disinfected, and a large number of other nuisances abated, making the total 5,720. The cost of disinfectants was larger than usual, in consequence of the great number of small-pox cases in the District. The sum paid to the men occupied in doing this work, without including the Inspector's time, was £140 18s. 9d.; the amount expended on disinfectants was £68 0s. 9d.; coke and coal, £10 5s. 4d.; and the other expenses were £2 8s. 4d., making a total of £223 12s. 7d. The persons benefited repaid a sum of £27 9s. 0d., leaving the nett cost nearly £200. The number of articles disinfected by the Officers of the Board was 4,483, and of houses 327. A.s I devoted a considerable part of my report for 1875 to a review of the sanitary statistics for the 20 years which had then elapsed since the constitution of the Board, I shall not refer at any great length to them now, although this completes the twenty-fifth year of my work. In table No. 8 you will find some decennial statistics for 1841-80, showing the increase of births and deaths for each decennial period, and of deaths under 1 year to each 100 births, as 56 well as of births to population; also the death rate per 1000 population, from all causes and from zymotic diseases. These show that the death rate per 1000 population in 1871-80 was only 19.6 against 20.37 for 1861-70, which, considering the increased density of population, is very satisfactory. The death rates since 1875 show better averages than before, having been 18.5, 19.3, 20.2, 18.8 and 18.3 for each of these years. As I did not present a resume of the work carried out in the Sanitary department during the 20 years, I now propose to rectify the omission. It appears from the record of work kept here, that there have been 6,965 cesspools emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer, a few of these having been from time to time discovered even of late years; no less than 10,896 choked drains have been either cleansed, repaired, or reconstructed as the case required; 5,426 new traps have been provided to the inlets of the drains; 2,034 yards drained; 4,518 yards have been newly paved or the paving repaired; 32,214 houses have been whitewashed, cleansed, and repaired; 5,931 houses have been disinfected and cleansed after zymotic disease had appeared therein; and 5,094 dust bins have been provided. Additional means of ventilation have also been provided in 2,939 houses, and a better water supply or water supply apparatus in 5,119 houses. There have also been 16,666 other nuisances abated, without including the very large number of requests to remove dust, which have been attended to. This is a goodly list, and accounts, in my opinion, to a great extent for the low death rate of the District. I have attended, during the year, 25 meetings of the Sanitary Committee; 15 meetings of the View Committee, for the purpose of inspecting cowsheds, slaugter houses, and proposed 6ites for new cowsheds and slaughter houses; and also 11 meetings for other purposes. In addition to these I have also attended all the Board 57 meetings. As this report is the 26th, I think it only right to thankfully acknowledge the uniform support, in carrying out my duties, that I have received from the Board during the 25 years I have been their Medical Officer of Health, and also to the Sanitary Committee during the 15 years I have acted under their more immediate direction, and trust that a similar support will he afforded to me so long as I shall perform the duties of my office. The weather in the month of January was unusually cold and dry, being more than 5 degrees below the mean of the previous 39 years, and the rainfall was the smallest since 1826. February was warm, having had a mean temperature of more than 8 degrees in excess of January, although it is often colder than that month. March also was unusually warm, the excess in these months being about 2½ degrees above the mean. The rainfall was also in defect in March. The weather in April was variable, the early part being warm, whilst the middle and latter end were cold and rainy. The first half of May was cold, especially at night, the day temperature being often high from warm sunshine. The rainfall was a little in excess in April and June, but was below the average in May. June was cold, being 1½ degrees below the average. In July the rainfall was in excess by 1.3 inches, whilst the temperature was minus 0.4 degrees, and in the early part of August cold still prevailed, but gave place during the last three weeks to fine bright weather, the rainfall being an inch and a half below the average. September was unusually warm, the mean temperature being more than two and a half degrees in excess, but the rainfall was also in excess by an inch and a half. October was cold and wet, the mean temperature being in defect by 4 degrees and the rainfall as much as 5 inches in excess. November was cold during the first and third weeks, but somewhat warmer for the other portion of the month, the mean being nearly 1 degree below the average. In December the weather was 58 mild, the mean temperature being 3.1 degrees in excess. In January the thermometer fell below freezing point on 23 days in Hackney, one day being as low as 18 degrees, and in February on 5 days only. In May the thermometer rose to 85.6, and was as low as 34.2, being a range of above 50 degrees. In June the highest temperature recorded was 78.6 degrees; in July, 77.6 degrees; in August, 81.4 degrees; in September, 87'8 degrees; in October, 63'8 degrees, and the lowest 30.2 degrees, giving a range of 33 degrees. In November the thermometer fell to 25 0 degrees, and in December to 30.6. In June there was an unusually heavy rainfall, viz., 2.28 inches on the 25th; in July there was a fall of 1.09 inches; and in September of 1.68 inches. Ordered to be printed and circulated as usual.
