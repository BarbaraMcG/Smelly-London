To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the Borough for the year 1908. The statistics of births, deaths and infectious diseases relate to the registration year, a period of 53 weeks, from December 30th, 1907, to January 2nd, 1909. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on April 6th, 1901, was 137,289, having increased from 113,781 during the previous five years. Estimated in the usual way on the assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed between 1896 and 1901 has been maintained since, the population of the borough was in the middle of 1908, 172,562. This is, however, certainly too high a figure, as but few new houses have been built during the past three years, and there are at present many empty tenements, especially in Sands End Ward, the statistics, therefore, in this report are based upon an estimated population of 159,860. The following table shows the increase of the borough since 1851:— 6 TABLE I. Year. Population. Increase per cent, during previous intercensal period. Persons to the Acre.

The number of marriages registered during the year was 1205, compared with 1,308, 1,203 and 1,207 in the three preceding years. The marriage-rate, i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants was 15.1, the average rate for the previous ten years being 16.5. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The births registered in the borough numbered 4,607— 2,337 males and 2,270 females, and were equal to an annual rate of 28.3 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is the same as that for 1907, but 4.1 below the mean rate of the ten years 1898-1907. 7 table ii.

Note.—The deaths included in Column 7 of this table are the whole of those registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. The deaths included in Column 12 are the number in Column 7, corrected by the subtraction of the number in Column 10 and the addition of the number in Column 11. By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account ot sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere. The "Public Institutions" to be taken into account for the purpose of these tables are those into which persons are habitually received on account of sickness or infirmity, such as hospitals, workhouses, and lunatic asylums. The births are not corrected by the distribution of those occurring in Lying-in Institutions. Area of District in acres (exclusive of area covered by water), 1.703.5. Total population at all ages 137,249 ) Number of inhabited houses 18,534 Average number of persons per house 7.4 At Census of 1901. 8 Births in Lying-in Institutions. Of the births registered, 124 took place in the Fulham Workhouse, and the mothers of nine of these children had resided outside the borough before admission, while the births of 112 children, whose mothers belonged to Fulham, occurred in Lying-in Institutions situate in other boroughs; so that the net total was 4,710, and the corrected birth-rate 28.9. The birth-rate of the County of London was 25.2 per 1,000, being the lowest recorded since civil registration was adopted, and among the several metropolitan boroughs the rates, after being corrected by the distribution of the births occurring in Lying-in Institutions to the boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission, ranged from 14.9 in the City of London and in Hampstead, 16.7 in Westminster, and 19.2 in Kensington, to 32.0 in Shoreditch, 32.1 in Stepney, and 32.6 in Bethnal Green. The following table gives the number of births registered and the birth-rates in the various wards, corrected by the distribution of the births occurring in Fulham Infirmary, but exclusive of those occurring in Lying-in Institutions outside the borough:- TABLE III.

The illegitimate births numbered 230,115 boys and 115 girls —or 5 per cent. of the total births registered in the borough. 9 Still-born Children. 170 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 27 living. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population of the borough by the excess of births over deaths was 2,553, compared with 2,422, 2,636 and 2,396 in the three preceding years. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The deaths of 1,999 persons—1,030 males and 969 females— were registered in Fulham during the 53 weeks, but of these 163—77 of males and 86 of females—were of persons not belonging to the borough who died within it; while the deaths of 321 residents in Fulham—197 males and 124 femalesoccurred outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were, therefore, 2,157 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham—1,150 males and 1,007 females—representing an annual rate of 13.24 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which is the lowest death-rate recorded in the district. The death-rate of males was 15.1, and of females 11.7, assuming the sex constitution of the population to be the same as in 1901. The death-rate of the County of London was 13.8 per 1,000, and among the several boroughs the lowest death-rates were 8.5 in Hampstead, 11.0 in Lewisham, 11.4 in Woolwich, and 11.6 in Wandsworth; while the highest were 17.4 in Shoreditch, 17.7 in the City of London, 18.6 in Finsbury, and 188 in Bermondsey. The death-rate of England and Wales in 1908 was 14.7, and that of the 76 great towns 14.9 per 1.000. Distribution of Deaths.

Death-rates vary considerably in different localities according to the age constitution of the populations, and in a district with a population comprising a large number of infants or very old people the death-rate, other conditions being similar, would of necessity be higher than that of one containing a large proportion of people of middle age. For the correction of the differences due to age and sex constitution factors of correction have been published by the Registrar General for the provincial towns, and by the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council for the metropolitan boroughs, and the multiplication of the recorded death-rate of a district by its factor of correction gives the death-rate which would obtain if the age and sex constitution of the population were in the same proportion as it ts in the whole of England and Wales, thus eliminating the differences due to age and sex. 13 In the following table the crude and corrected death-rates of Fulham may be compared with those of the adjoining boroughs, the County of London, England and Wales, and the large and small towns. TABLE VI. Recorded Death-rate. Corrected Death-rate. Fulham 13.2 13.9 Kensington 12.9 13.9 Chelsea 14.5 15.0 Hammersmith 14.0 14.6 County of London 13.8 14.5 England and Wales 14.7 14.7 76 Great Towns 14.9 15.8 142 Smaller Towns 14.0 14.7 England and Wales less the 218 towns 14.7 13.8 Seasonal Mortality The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under:— TABLE VII. Deaths. Death-rate. First quarter 601 15.0 Second quarter 528 13.2 Third quarter 471 11.8 Fourth quarter (14 weeks) 557 12.9 2,157 13.2 Mortality in Former Years. In Table II. will be found the number of deaths and the death-rate in each of the ten preceding years. The difference between the rate for 1908 and the average rate for the ten years 1898-1907 represents a saving of 400 lives. 14 MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. Of the 2,157 deaths registered, 545 or 25.3 per cent. were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered in Fulham, was 118 per 1,000 and 116 per 1,000 after distribution of the births in the various metropolitan Lying-in Institutions. This is the lowest infantile death-rate yet recorded, and is 31 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding ten years. The rate of the County of London was 113 per 1,000, and of the metropolitan boroughs ten had higher and eighteen lower rates than Fulham. In England and Wales the infantile death-rate was 121, and in the 76 large towns 128 per 1,000. The decrease in the infantile death-rate was as in the previous year largely due to the relatively low diarrhœal mortality consequent upon the cool summer, but the following table, which gives the average mortality of the quinquennia from 1886, when Fulham was separated from Hammersmith, affords some evidence of improving conditions. TABLE VIII Deaths of Infants under one year of age per 1,000 births.

Table X. gives the causes of infantile mortality at various periods under one year, and the following gives the proportion of deaths occurring at certain age periods:— 15 TABLE IX. Age Period. Percentage of Total Deaths under one Year. Under one week 20.6 Over one and under four weeks 11.9 One and under three months 19.1 Three and under six months 18.9 Six and under nine months 16.5 Nine and under twelve months 13.0 100.0 From diarrhœal diseases there were 120 deaths, or 25.5 per 1,000 births, compared with 21.8, 47.8 and 40.0 in the three previous years. There has been but little variation in the last four years in the number of deaths from wasting diseases, a group which includes premature birth, atelectasis, and congenital malformation together with atrophy and debility, since the majority of deaths from the latter occur in the earlier weeks of life, and are due to ante-natal causes. In 1908 196, or 36 per cent. of all the deaths of infants under one year of age were attributed to these diseases, which is about the same proportion as in London and the other great towns. 14 infants were suffocated while in bed with other persons, or 3.0 per 1,000 births, the corresponding death-rate in the County of London being 3.2 per 1,000. The Children Act, 1908, which comes into force on April 1st. 1909, provides that where it is proved that the death of an infant under three years of age was caused by suffocation whilst the infant was in bed with some other person over sixteen years of age, and that that other person was at the time of going to bed under the influence of drink, that other person shall be deemed to have neglected the infant in a manner likely to cause injury to its health within the meaning of the Act. 16 TABLE X.

Deaths in the year of—Legitimate infants, 487; Illegitimate infants, 58. 17 Population—159,850 (estimated to middle of 1908). Deaths from all Causes at all Ages—2,157. B 18 Prevention of Infant Mortality. Notification of Births Act. The Notification of Births Act has been, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, adopted by the Council, and came into operation within the borough on March 14th, 1908. From that date to January 2nd, 1909, 2,915 notifications were received, and in the same period 3,647 births were registered, so that about 80 per cent, of the births were duly notified:—1,381 of the notifications, or 47 per cent., were forwarded by midwives, 898, or 31 per cent., by medical practitioners, and 636, or 22 per cent., by the father or other relative. 1,725 mothers were visited during the year either by Mrs. Davies, the Sanitary Inspector, or by one of the ladies who have been good enough to assist in this work, and as a rule they are well received, but it is not possible, even with the help of the voluntary workers, to secure the frequent visiting which is essential to success. As I have before stated, if the Council wish to fulfil the obligation they assumed when they adopted the Notification of Births Act, two ladies should be appointed to act exclusively as Health Visitors. Prominent mention must be made of a scheme to reduce the high infantile mortality in Fulham by the systematic instruction of nursing mothers, which has been recently started by Mrs. Frank Stoop, who was mainly instrumental in founding the crêche, or day nursery, in Harwood Road, which has been most helpful to mothers compelled to go out to work. Since July last an Infants Consultation has been held once a week at St. Augustine's Hall, Lillie Road, kindly lent by Rev P. S. G. Propert, Vicar of St. Augustine's, at which mothers and their babies have been seen by Miss Benham, M.D.Lond., or Mrs. Dunnett, M.D.Lond., given advice as to the best methods of feeding and nursing, and subsequently visited at their homes by lady helpers. The success which has attended this has encouraged the promoters to extend their efforts, and if there is adequate response to the appeal for the necessary funds, it is their intention to take permanent premises and work on the lines of the St. Pancras School for Mothers, which has been so successful. 19 Table XI. gives the infantile death-rates of the several wards of the borough since 1901, when particulars of the distribution of the births were first obtained. The persistently high rate of Walham Ward is especially noticeable, chiefly due to the heavy mortality prevailing in Heckfield Place and the adjoining Avenues. TABLE XI.

Deaths of Illegitimate Infants 58 of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 252 deaths to every 1,000 births, compared with 111 deaths to every 1,000 births among children born in wedlock. The following table gives the causes of deaths among illegitimate infants. B 2 20 TABLE XII. MORTALITY OF ILLEGITIMATE INFANTS.

Between the ages of one and five years 237 deaths were recorded, so that the deaths of children tinder the age of five years numbered 782, or 36.3 per cent, of the deaths of all ages. This number corresponds to a death-rate of 37.0 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age, which is the lowest death-rate recorded in Fulham at that age period, and 16.1 per 1,000 below the average rate of the preceding ten years. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, were issued in respect of 409 children under 5, 52.3 per cent, of the children dying at that age period being insured. Mortality at School Age. At the ages of 5-15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 89 deaths, or 4.1 per cent, of the total number, representing a mortality of 2.6 per 1,000 of those living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. Between the ages of IB and 25 years, 76, or 3.5 per cent, of all the deaths were recorded, the death-rate at this age period being 3.0 per 1,000. Mortality at Maturity. 761, or 35.3 per cent., of the deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65 years, the mortality being at the rate of 10.3 per 1,000. Mortality at Decline. At the age of 65 and upwards there were 449 deaths, or 20.8 per cent, of those at all ages, corresponding to a death-rate of 82.8 per 1,000. 22 DEATHS FROM EPIDEMIC DISEASES. To the seven principal epidemic diseases 276 deaths were ascribed, representing- a death-rate of 1.70 per 1,000 inhabitants, which is 1 per 1,000 below the mean rate of the decennium 1898-1907. The corresponding death rate of the County of London was 1.35 per 1,000, the decennial average being 2.15. In the metropolitan borough the rates ranged from 0.40 in Hampstead and the City of London, 0.82 in Stoke Newington, and 0.93 in Wandsworth, to 2.30 in Bermondsey, 2.48 in Bethnal Green, and 2.53 in Stepney. In Table XIII. will be found the number of deaths from each of the principal epidemic diseases in 1908, and the ten preceding years, and in Table XIV. the death-rates from them per 1,000 of the estimated population of each ward in 1908. 23 TABLE XIII.

The disease was most prevalent in the first three months of the year, and the usual autumnal rise, which generally reaches its maximum about the end of October, was not marked. The returns for the four quarters were: — Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 215 7 2nd „ 108 5 3rd „ 119 1 4th „ (14 weeks) 154 4 596 17 The cases occurred in 481 houses, as under:— Houses with one case 400 „ „ two cases 61 „ „ three „ 14 „ „ four „ 1 „ „ five „ 3 „ ,, SIX „ 1 „ ;) seven „ 1 Isolation.—558, or 93.6 per cent, of the patients notified, were removed to hospital for treatment. Fatality,—The deaths from the disease, 17 in number, represent a case mortality of 2.9 per cent., against 2.1, 2.7 and 3.0 per cent, in the three preceding years. Return Cases.—Sixteen cases occurred within fourteen days of the return of a child living in the same house, from hospital, after recovery from a similar attack. Distribution of Cases. In Table XVI. will be found the number of cases notified in each ward of the borough, and the following table shows the proportional prevalence of scarlet fever in the several wards during 1908 and the preceding ten years. Chart Shewing Week by Week the Number of Cases of Scarlet Fever & Diphtheria, Notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the Borough of Fulham during the 53 weeks ended January 2nd, 1909. 31 In Table "B" in the appendix are given the streets in which the cases occurred.

The man was seen at his residence, found to be suffering, as stated, from Scarlet Fever, and removed to the Western Fever Hospital. As he had travelled up by train from Shrewsbury when knowing himself to be suffering from an infectious disease, and thereby must have endangered the health of many people with whom he had come in contact, the Public Health Committee were advised to take proceedings against him under the Public Health Act, for wilfully exposing himself when suffering from Scarlet Fever, but decided to take no action in the matter. 32 DIPHTHERIA. The cases of Diphtheria notified in the four quarters of the year were as under:— Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 101 6 2nd „ 63 1 3rd „ 97 11 4th„ 139 14 400 32 Compared with 1907, when 606 cases were notified, the disease showed a marked decline, but it was, as usual, proportionally more prevalent in Fulham than in the County of London, the respective case rates being 25 and 17 per 10,000 of the population. The 400 cases occurred in 359 houses, as under:— Houses with one case 325 „ „ two cases 28 „ three „ 5 „ four „ 1 Isolation.—354, or 88.5 per cent., of those certified to be suffering from the disease, were removed to the hospital for treatment. Fatality.—32 cases terminated fatally, representing a casemortality of 8 per cent., compared with 6.3, 8.2, and 8.4 in the three preceding years. The decline in the fatality of diphtheria of recent years will be seen from the subjoined table. This is largely owing to the use of antitoxic serum, but the detection by bacteriological examination of very mild cases which formerly escaped notice has also assisted in lowering the fatality rate. 33 TABLE XXII.

Both Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever being especially diseases of children, we must expect that the daily aggregation of such individuals will tend to widen their prevalence, especially as, not infrequently, the disease being of a mild type, children actually suffering have been found to be attending school. The following tables give the number of children in actual attendance at each school who were notified in each month as suffering from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 35 TABLE XXV.

Fatality.—There were 10 deaths, giving a case mortality of 26 per cent., or 30 per cent. if 6 cases be deducted which were subsequently ascertained not to be cases of typhoid. In five cases oysters, in two mussels, and in one winkles had been eaten within a fortnight of the commencement of the illness. The incidence of Enteric Fever in Fulham during the previous 10 years is shown in the following table: — TABLE XXIV. Notified Cases of Enteric Fever. Year. Number of Cases.

Of the patients certified as suffering from Scarlet Fever 27 or 4.5 per cent., from Diphtheria 23 or 5.6 per cent, and from Enteric Fever 6, or 15.4 per cent, were subsequently ascertained not to be suffering from those diseases. 38 Puerperal Fever. Seventeen cases of Puerperal Fever, or 3.7 per 1,000 births, were notified, of which 10 or 2.1 per 1,000 births, proved fatal. Eleven of the patients were removed to Fulham Infirmary, and one to St. George's Hospital. Erysipelas. 127 persons were certified to be suffering from Erysipelas, which was the assigned cause of 6 deaths. Epidcmic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. Four cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, but in two the diagnosis was not confirmed. Two deaths were ascribed to the disease of which one is not included with the notified cases, the nature of the disease not being ascertained before the autopsy. In the County of London 85 cases with 10 deaths were notified, as against 136 cases with 24 deaths in 1907; but there was no evidence of the spread of the disease from any of the notified cases. DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. The deaths from Measles in the four quarters of the year were:— No. of Deaths. 1st Quarter 26 2nd ,, 32 3rd „ 7 4th ,, (14 weeks) 6 71 39 The death-rate was 0.44 per 1,000, compared with 0.31 in the County of London and an average of 0.51 for the 10 years 1897-1906. The cases reported to the Medical Officer of Health numbered 594, and were distributed as under:— Cases. Baron's Court Ward 11 Lillie Ward 75 Walham Ward 40 Margravine Ward 63 Munster Ward 129 Hurlingham Ward 22 Sands End Ward 212 Town Ward 42 594 The deaths in the several wards will be found in Table IV., and the death-rates in Table XIV.

Whooping Cough. Whooping Cough was less in evidence than usual, 34 deaths being ascribed to it against a decennial average of 58. All the deaths were of children under five years of age. 41 Diarrhœa. The deaths in the four quarters of the year due to Diarrhœa and Zymotic or Infective Enteritis, were:— No. of Deaths, Death-rate. 1st Quarter 5 0.13 2nd „ 5 0.13 3rd „ 75 1.89 4th ,, (14 weeks) . 27 0.62 112 0.69 The mortality from Diarrhœa was higher than in 1907, when 83 deaths were due to it, but was considerably below the average of the ten years 1898-1907, viz., 175; and the position of Fulham, as compared with other metropolitan boroughs, was somewhat less unfavourable than usual, 8 boroughs having higher rates, whereas in 1907 only one, and in 1906 but two boroughs had higher rates. The excessive diarrhœal mortality of Fulham as compared with the County of London and the adjoining boroughs will be seen from the following table:—- TABLE XXVII. Deaths from Diarrhœa per 1,000 living. Mean of 5 years, 1886-1890. Mean of 5 years, 1891-1895. Mean of 5 years, 1896-1900.

In addition to these, 15 patients attending Brompton Hospital were notified through the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, to whom since the beginning of November notifications are forwarded by the hospital authorities, and then distributed to the boroughs in which the patients reside, and in order that contact cases may be detected as early as possible, if it is thought desirable that any member of the patient's family should be medically examined, an order admitting for such examination is given by the Secretary of the Hospital. The cases notified in the various wards were as under:— Baron's Court Ward 6 Lillie Ward 34 Walham Ward 24 Margravine Ward 36 MunsterWard 43 Hurlingham Ward 5 Sands End Ward 25 Town Ward 6 Regulations as to Tuberculosis. In December regulations under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for preventing the spread of Tuberculosis were issued by the Local Government Board, which came into force on January 1st, 1909. By these regulations notifications to the Medical Officer of Health by Poor Law Officers of the following persons who are suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis are required:— (a) By the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution of any inmate of the Institution, to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the Institution is situate, and to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the patient resided immediately before his admission to the Poor Law Institution. 44 (b) By a District Medical Officer of any poor person upon whom he is in medical attendance according to his agreement with a Board of Guardians. (c) By the Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution of a poor person who has been an inmate of the Institution and whose case has been notified by the Medical Officer of the Poor Law Institution, together with the intended residence of the poor person, to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the intended residence is situate. id) By a Relieving Officer respecting a change of residence of a poor person, residing in his relief district, whose case has been notified by the District Medical Officer, to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the changed residence of the poor person is situate. Under these regulations the Council have power, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, to take all measures with regard to the disinfection or cleansing of infected articles and premises that are authorised by the Public Health Acts in cases of infectious or dangerous infectious diseases, and may supply within such reasonable limits as the circumstances of the case require or allow such assistance, facilities or articles as may diminish the risk of infection from the room occupied by the poor person, and may furnish for his use, on loan or otherwise any appliance or utensil which may be of assistance for the purpose of any precaution against the spread of infection. But it is expressly laid down that nothing in the regulations shall authorise the Medical Officer of Health, or the Council, to put into force, with respect to any poor person in relation to whom a notification has been given under the regulations, any enactment which renders the poor person, or a person in charge of the poor person, or any other person liable to a penalty, or subject the poor person to any restriction, prohibition or disability affecting himself or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood or residence, on the ground of his suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 45 INFLUENZA. 33 deaths were stated to be due to Influenza, the numbers for the three preceding years being 33, 30, and 12. DEATHS FROM OTHER DISEASES. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 117 deaths, equivalent to a deathrate of 0.73 per 1,000, as against 0.97 in 1907, and an average of 0.82 for the ten years 1898-1907. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases there were 405 deaths, or 18.8 of the deaths from all causes, being 92 below the corrected decennial average. CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATHS. Of the 2,157 deaths registered, 1,971, or 91.4 per cent., were certified by registered medical practitioners and 184 by coroners, after inquests, only 2 deaths being uncertified. Inquests. A verdict of death from natural causes was returned after 88, and from accident or misadventure after 96, inquests. Particulars of the latter will be found in Table A in the Appendix.

Bakehouses. There are 69 bakehouses on the register, of which 50 are underground. In eight cases cleansing was found necessary, which was at once carried out on receipt of notice. Outworkers. The homes of the outworkers employed by firms both within and without the borough have again received attention, but it was only found necessary to serve three notices in respect of nuisances found in them. Workplaces, Restaurant Kitchens. The 93 kitchens of restaurants and coffee-houses have been kept under supervision by Mrs. Davies, who paid 250 visits and served 54 notices, 45 on account of want of cleanliness and 11 in respect of other defects. The following tables, prepared at the request of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, give a summary of the work done in connection with the Factory Act: — Administration of the Factory and.

Additional powers relating to the sale of milk have been conferred upon metropolitan sanitary authorities by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. Section V. provides that any Sanitary Authority may remove from or refuse to enter on the register the names of dairymen or purveyors of milk whose premises are, in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority, for any reason, unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon, provided that premises shall not be deemed unsuitable for the sale of milk therein on any ground inconsistent with the provisions 53 or requirements of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. Any person feeling aggrieved by any decision of the Sanitary Authority under the provisions of this section may appeal within 21 days from the date of such decision to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. Hitherto purveyors of milk could be placed on the register without any restrictions, and the necessity for the local authority having power to refuse registration has been frequently urged by the Borough Council, as it is certainly to the advantage of the public health that there should be power to prohibit the storage of a food so susceptible to contamination as milk on premises quite unfitted for the purpose. With the view of enforcing these provisions, an inspection of the premises where milk is sold or stored has been made by the Food Inspector and Medical Officer of Health, and the Public Health Committee have been advised to remove 48 of these premises from the register. Sanitary Regulations for Premises used for the Sale or Storage of Food. Section viii. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, gives the Borough Council power to enforce the following sanitary regulations for premises used for the sale or storage of food. (a) No urinal, water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ashpit, or other like sanitary convenience shall be within such room, shop or other part of a building, or shall communicate therewith except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (b) No cistern for supplying water to such room, shop or other part of a building shall be in direct communication with and directly discharge into any such sanitary convenience. (c) No drain or pipe for carrying off fæcal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within such room, shop or other part of a building. 54 (d) No such room, shop or other part of a building shall be used as a sleeping place, and so far as may be reasonably necessary to prevent risk of the infection or contamination of any such article as aforesaid, no sleeping place shall adjoin such room, shop or other part of a building and communicate therewith, except through the open air or through in intervening ventilated space. (e) Refuse and filth, whether solid or liquid, shall not be deposited or allowed to accumulate in any such room, shop or other part of a building, except so far as may be reasonably necessary for the proper carrying on of trade or business. (f) Due cleanliness shall be observed in regard to such room, shop or other part of a building, and all articles, apparatus and utensils therein, and shall be observed by persons engaged in such room, shop, or other part of a building. Section xii. of the same Act gives Sanitary Authorities, or any officer or person duly authorised by them, the right to enter at all reasonable times any house, building or premises in the district of such Sanitary Authority, for the purpose of examining whether there is any contravention of the foregoing provisions of the Act, or of any by-law made thereunder, or any non-compliance with the requirements of any notice given thereunder respectively. This is a very useful provision, as it may be remembered that in 1903 a summons taken out by the Council against the occupier of a confectionery shop, for obstructing one of their Sanitary Inspectors by refusing to allow him to inspect her premises, upon which it was believed that ice creams were manufactured, there being a notice in the window that they were sold there, was dismissed with costs against the Council, the magistrate holding that the refusal or failure to admit could only be made the subject of a penalty if it were proved that such refusal was made with the view to preventing the discovery of some contravention of the Public Health (London) Act. 55 Ice Creams. The premises where these are sold or made have been regularly inspected by the District Inspectors, and in 12 instances it was found necessary to serve notices on account of some insanitary condition. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. The licenses of the undermentioned cowsheds and slaughterhouses were renewed by the London County Council in October, no objections being raised by the Borough Council: — Cowsheds. Premises. Licensee. No. of Cows kept. 2, Haldane Road W. Pettitt 23 25, Vanston Place R. Turvey — Slaughterhouses. Premises. Licensee. 611, Fulham Road T. S. Payne. 105, Hammer smith Road H. Boughton & Co. 640, King's Road E. Vaughan. 603, King's Road S. Stone. Unsound Food. The stalls and shops where food is sold or stored have been regularly inspected. The following articles, examined at the request of the owners, were condemned and destroyed : — 25 cases of fish. 50 baskets of strawberries 16 boxes of tomatoes. 2 boxes of lemons. 10 baskets of plums. 2 cases of pomegranates. 2 cases of rabbits. 56 Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The undermentioned samples were purchased for analysis in 1908, those purchased without the formalities prescribed by the Acts being distinguished from those purchased officially: — Article.

A large amount of fraud in connection with the sale of butter continues to be practised in Fulham, and of 421 samples purchased as butter no less than 8(3 or over 20 per cent. were found to be margarine. The tripe, sausages, kidneys, tinned prawns and brawn reported as adulterated all contained boric acid. As the amount of this drug present did not exceed 0.25 per cent. (17½ grains to the pound), except in one sample of tripe, which contained 20 grains to the pound, the Public Health Committee, in view of the unsatisfactory condition of the law with regard to the use of preservatives in food, did not take any further steps in the matter beyond informing the vendors that they were of opinion that whenever any drug is added to food the purchaser should be notified of its presence. 58 Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts were instituted by the Council in the following cases:— Defendant.

Section 20 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, gives power to the sanitary authority to require the cleansing of any house infested with vermin, and provides penalties for default. Notices were served in respect of 77 rooms and complied with. CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS PERSONS. A letter was received from the London County Council drawing the attention of the Borough Council to the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with reference to the cleansing of verminous persons. Section 30 of the Act gives power to the Medical Officer of Health of the County or any other persons authorised by him (a) to examine the person and clothing of any child attending any London County Council school, to ascertain whether the person or clothing of such child is infested with vermin or in a filthy condition; (b) to require the parent or other person responsible for such child to effect the cleansing and clothing of the child within 24 hours' notice to that effect; and (c) in default of such parent or responsible persons, to remove the child from the school, and to cause its person or clothing to be properly cleansed in suitable premises, and with suitable appliances, and to detain there the child until the cleansing has been effected. Section 37 contains similar provision with regard to the inmates of any common lodging-house. Section 38 provides that the London County Council or any Sanitary Authority may make agreements as to the cleansing of such persons referred to, and for the use of any premises or appliances adapted for such purpose belonging to the Sanitary Authority. Before making any definite arrangements to put the Act in force, the County Council desired full information as to the extent of the provision already existing in the borough, and the facilities which the Borough Council would be prepared to afford them in the matter. 62 The Borough Council were advised by the Medical Officer of Health that with respect to verminous persons from common lodging-houses, having regard to the fact that there is only one common lodging-house in Fulham, sufficient accommodation existed at the Disinfecting Station to deal with the few cases likely to arise, there being a bath there and a dressing-room, together with appliances for freeing the clothes from vermin. With regard to children, for whom separate arrangements must be made, the Medical Officer of Health recommended that the necessary provision should be made at the Shelter adjoining the Disinfecting Station, where the alterations and additions necessary for the work could be made at a cost of about £15, and that the services of a woman to bathe the children should be engaged, to be paid either by Borough Council or London County Council. The Borough Council, however, decided to inform the County Council that they were willing to co-operate with them by cleansing verminous clothing, and enforcing the provisions of sections 19, 20, 21 and 24 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, relating to verminous rooms, but that in their opinion the cleansing of verminous children should be undertaken by the parents of such children. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. In the report for 1906, the attention of the Council was called to the unsatisfactory nature of the exemption clauses of the bye-laws in respect of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and further experience has shown that these clauses must be amended if any use is to be made of the bye-laws, as at present many houses escape registration, which can only be dealt with satisfactorily, in the interests alike of owners and occupiers, in this manner. DRAINAGE OF BUILDINGS. During the year the following drainage plans were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee. Plans of drainage of new houses 85 Plans of drainage for additions to existing buildings 27 Plans of the reconstruction of the drainage of existing buildings 220 272 63 Combined. Drainage. Six systems of combined drainage for portions of which the Council was liable, owing to certain of the pipes which received the drainage of more than one building, forming "sewers" within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, were reconstructed during the year at a cost to the Council of £58 10s. 4d., the work being carried out by a contractor under a schedule of prices. The sum of £159 5s. 9d. was also paid to owners in respect of work executed by them in compliance with notices served by the Council at 18 houses in connection with house drains, which were "sewers" as defined by the Metropolis Management Act. CERTIFICATES UNDER THE REVENUE ACTS. Applications in respect of 627 dwellings were received for certificates under the Revenue Acts for exemption from or abatement of inhabited house duty, of which 199 were given, 204 were granted after the completion of certain specified work, and 224 were refused. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Five intimation and two statutory notices were served under the Public Health (London) Act in respect of smoke nuisances. A letter was received from the London County Council asking for the views of the Borough Council with regard to a draft scheme for the amendment of the law with the view of dealing more effectively with smoke nuisances. The proposals of the London County Council were :— (a) That dense smoke discharged from any building, vessel, stationary or locomotive engine, place or premises (other than a private dwelling house) within the area of the City and the County of London and the surrounding urban districts to a distance of twelve miles of Charing Cross, or upon the waters of the Port of London and 64 its tributaries within such area, shall be a nuisance, for which a fine not exceeding £10 may be imposed, with cumulative penalties for subsequent offences at the discretion of the magistrate. The substitution of the word "dense" for "black" will enable local authorities to abate many smoke nuisances that under existing circumstances it is difficult to deal with on account of its not being " black." (b) That the Council shall have power to make Bye-laws, subject to the approval of the Home Office or the Local Government Board. i. To bring under the terms of the provision set out in conclusion (a) other instances of avoidable smoke nuisance. ii. To prescribe and revise from time to time a standard of smoke nuisance to further define emissions of smoke to be liable to penalties. iii. To prohibit the adoption in new or reconstructed factories, premises or buildings, or any furnace, or grate or other fuel consuming apparatus of a type which shall have been proved to the satisfaction of the Council to produce an unnecessary amount of smoke. iv. To prescribe any additional measures or requirements necessary for the suppression and prevention of smoke nuisance. v. To provide a penalty for the breach of any such Bye-law not exceeding the penalty specified in conclusion (a). (c) That exemption from liability to penalties implied or expressed in favour of Crown property or premises of electric power corporations be repealed. 65 (d) That it shall be the duty of the several Sanitary Authorities to enforce the provisions of the law and any bye-laws made by the Council. (e) That the Council shall have joint authority with the several administrative bodies to enforce the law, and any bye-laws within the area as above defined, with power to recover from the Sanitary Authority when it has been in default, the expenses of proceedings not recovered by order of a Court and not incurred in unsuccessful proceedings. (f) That the County Council shall be the paramount authority for the whole area above defined, and as such shall have power to expend money for the purposes of i. Promoting a knowledge of the principles of (a) Combustion of fuel. (b) Furnace and grate construction. (c) Stoking. ii. Encouraging the study of the scientific heating of houses or the use of smokeless fuels, with a view to the reduction of nuisances from the open fire grate. iii. Determining generally the best means for securing the prevention of smoke in the consumption of fuel. The Borough Council informed the London County Council that they were in favour of an amendment of the law dealing with smoke nuisance, but were of opinion, (1) that the powers sought to be obtained should be limited to the area of the City and County of London; (2) that the enforcement of the law and any bye-laws on the subject of smoke nuisances should be solely in the hands of the several local authorities in whose districts the nuisances arise; and (3) that any bye-laws to be made by the London County Council on the subject, pursuant to statutory powers, should be submitted to and approved by the Local Authorities who are charged with enforcing them.
