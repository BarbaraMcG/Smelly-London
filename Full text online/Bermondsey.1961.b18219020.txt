Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you for your consideration a report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1961. The report follows a similar pattern to that of previous years which enables easy reference and comparison. The sections give you a guide to the varied work carried out by your Public Health Department. It only remains for me to stress here an important aspect of our work. Namely Infectious Diseases. On March 28th, 1961, I was notified that a child aged 7 years had a positive swab for diphtheria and, on clinical examination, she was a classical case of membranous diphtheria of the throat. Immediately that late afternoon and evening all contacts were seen and swabbed. On the reswabbing a few days later a second child was positive and removed to hospital as a carrier. Late in May two mild cases were diagnosed and also numerous carriers. From this short account it can be seen that great care must be taken to ensure a high level of active immunity. This, of course, means regular attendance at clinics for our infants and children to receive the necessary injections. May I extend my thanks to members of the Council and to the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year, also to all members of the staff for their help and loyal support. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. E. EPSOM. VITAL STATISTICS. AREA The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres.

As this disease very seldom occurs, indeed it is six years since the last case was notified in the Borough, the following details are submitted. Case 1 A female child of 7 years was removed to hospital on 28th March, 1961 with classical faucial diphtheria, the date of onset being 26th March. She had last attended school on 24th March and as the school was dispersing for Easter holidays on 29th March a nominal roll of her classmates was obtained immediately and the 34 children were visited at home and swabbed twice during the period 30th March to 5th April. A male child of 6 years had a positive second swab and was removed to hospital as a carrier. The original case had attended a children's dancing class in the Borough on the Saturday morning prior to her removal to hospital and a list of the names and addresses of children who had attended that class was obtained. 51 of the children who lived in the Borough were swabbed together with 9 of the children resident in an adjoining Borough but who were, during the school holidays, staying with relatives in Bermondsey during the day. The dancing class instructress and her family were also swabbed. Negative results were obtained in all cases. Details of 8 children resident outside the Borough were given to the Medical Officers of Health concerned. Case 2 A male child of 6 years was removed to hospital on 24th May as a mild case and routine case swabbing was carried out by the London County Council staff at the school. During the period 25th May to 7th June 14 children from the patient's school were removed to hospital as carriers. Case 3 This was a very mild case and occurred in a boy attending another school but his cousin was one of the above carriers. Swabbing of home contacts was carried out by the department throughout. One of the carriers had, prior to his admission to hospital, attended a meeting of a local Wolf Cub pack. Arrangements were made to swab the contacts resident in the Borough, numbering six, and details of eleven resident outside the Borough were passed to the Medical Officers of Health concerned. Under the expert care and attention of Hither Green Hospital the three cases fully recovered; there were no complications. OLD PEOPLES WELFARE I must again stress the value of encouraging the elderly to venture out as often as they are able. This is particularly important where the elderly who live alone are concerned. They can all too easily allow themselves to become careless in their personal cleanliness and to be easily satisfied with a makeshift meal. We are fortunate in Bermondsey that there are so many voluntary clubs catering solely for elderly people where this class of person can find some companionship. The Meals on Wheels service is proving invaluable in meeting the needs of the elderly handicapped person who lives alone. This section of the community requires a great deal of attention from the Welfare Services. A nucleus of old people requiring baths either in their own homes or in the Disinfecting Station numbered approximately 44 per week during the year. The old people who by reason of their medical condition required their bed linen and personal clothing to be cleansed by the Laundry Service averaged 59 per week. Municipal Club The Club now in its fourth year has an increased enrolled membership of 458. This increase is due in no small measure to the improved accommodation provided by the extension to the Club which was completed in October. It was interesting to note that during the structural alterations members remained loyal. They apparently were not disturbed by the activities of the builders. The Mayor accompanied by the Mayoress and other Members of the Council opened the extension in November. The Old Time Dancing classes, whist drives, darts and similar games form the basis of the Club's weekly programme. The programme is varied when the opportunity occurs by outings to the countryside and visits to the theatre and the cinema. The seat price concession for old people at many West End theatres and cinemas enables members to visit matinee performances at a price more suited to their pockets. The Arts and Crafts class introduced last year is increasing in its popularity. A part of members under the guidance of the Club Organiser and her husband spent a fortnight's holiday in Jersey. The journey, which was made by air, was for these people an exciting and an adventurous one. By arrangement with the Entertainments Officer, concert parties have played a number of times at the Club. This form of entertainment is always popular with the old people. The Annual Outing of the Club and Workrooms was again to Southsea on 21st June. The number of members attending was 152 which was slightly higher than the figure for the previous year. The workrooms have been increasingly active in fulfilling the contracts accepted for them. In addition to the production and preparation of various types of stationery, they have prepared braids for braces and assembled small pieces of diving equipment. The Bulletin published by the Borough Council is also assembled for despatch in the workrooms. The South Eastern Gas Board demonstrated a new gas cooker designed especially for the use of the elderly and the handicapped. These cookers are available on hire from the S.E.G.B. on the production of a medical certificate. A "Bring and Buy" sale was held in December. This is becoming an annual event and proves extremely useful in raising funds for the Christmas Party. The fortnightly visit by the mobile library to the Club is eagerly awaited by those members who like to read. The Council continues to act as agents for the Council for the Welfare of Old People in the operation of the Meals on Wheels service and the Meals Service provided for the Municipal Club. The following table sets out the number of meals supplied during the year. Meals on Wheels Municipal Club January 1,978 937 February 1,797 844 March 2,020 941 April 1,794 827 May 2,103 876 June 2,048 777 July 2,013 794 August 2,023 969 September 1,989 863 October 2,234 971 1,018 November 2,257 December 1,967 757 23,223 10,574 The Meals on Wheels service is operated by three units each consisting of a van, driver and attendant. The average number of meals supplied to the elderly homebound people by this service daily throughout the year was 93. The outings organised for the Spring and Summer were mostly revisits to places visited the previous year. These were a trip to Southend by steamer and conducted tours of the Huntley & Palmers factory at Reading and the Guinness Brewery at Park Royal. This last visit is quite a favourite with the members. A tour of the hopfields which also took in a short stay at Hastings was included in the programme. There were also trips to the castles at Windsor and Bodiam. The fact that so much of the Club's activities show no great change in its variety does not mean there is a lack of ideas, but among old people there is, understandably, a feeling of contentment and security about familiar places. The Club has maintained its association with the Women's Institute organisation. Visits were made to institutes at Bolney, Sussex, Beaconsfield, Bucks, and to Hadlow near Tonbridge. These visits besides giving members the opportunity of a day in the country, also affords them the opportunity of meeting people who live in a different environment. The members of the institutes visited by the Club have in their turn been invited to Bermondsey and entertained. Coach tours of the Borough were also arranged for them and to judge from the complimentary remarks made by the visitors many preconceived ideas about Bermondsey must have been dispelled. Every Thursday a number of handicapped people are brought to the Club so that they may join the members in their activities. The number of such people and the frequency of the visits is restricted by the transport situation. If more transport was available the number of handicapped persons visiting the Club could be increased, thereby helping to bring them a little more companionship. An extension to the Meals on Wheels service was introduced in May to cover the week-ends so that those people who are handicapped and therefore unable to make adequate provision for Saturday and Sunday could be provided with a meal. This addition to the service began with two people and by December this number had increased to eleven. The meal is a frozen one, flavour sealed and prepared by a well known firm of caterers. Four items make up the meal and they are easily heated for consumption by immersion for a few minutes in boiling water. (17) NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 47 Where necessary, the Council has authority under this Section of the Act to make application for a Court Order for the emergency removal to hospital, or institution, for a period not exceeding three months, of an aged, infirm, or physically incapacitated person who is suffering from a grave chronic disease or is living in insanitary conditions and who is "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention." There is also provision under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951 for a magistrate to order the emergency removal of such persons to a hospital or institution for a period not exceeding twenty one days, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and a general medical practitioner. During the year under report, it was necessary to make application for a committal order under this Act in respect of an old lady aged 78 who was living alone and was a severe diabetic case. Contrary to the advice of her doctor she had refused to have hospital treatment despite the fact that she was fully aware of the serious state of her health. Unfortunately, the old lady's condition continued to deteriorate and she died within one month of her admission to hospital. It is only in exceptional cases of this kind, where persuasive efforts have failed, that compulsory measures are adopted. During the course of the year, five old people agreed voluntarily to be admitted to homes for the elderly and the necessary arrangements were made. Section 50 Under this section of the Act it is the responsibility of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of a person dying in the Borough where there are no relatives or other persons who would be prepared to make the funeral arrangements. Where possible, the Council's expenses in such cases, inclusive of an administrative charge, are recoverable from the deceased's estate. During the course of the year six burials were arranged at the request of the Coroner's Officer and particulars of these cases are given hereunder: 1. Mr. G. G. Body recovered from Thames. Sister only relative traced, her financial circumstances being such that she could not contribute towards the cost of the funeral. Council's expenses recovered by death grant from Ministry of Pensions & National Insurance. 2. Mrs. J. P. K. Burial arranged after post mortem in the absence of relatives prepared to accept responsibility. Nearest relative a brother resident in Eire who intimated he or other relatives were unable to contribute towards the cost of the funeral. Council's expenses recovered by death grant. B1 3. Still-born child. Bodies recovered from Thames. Cost of burial written off in each case. 4. Still-born child. 5. Unidentified man. Body recovered from Thames. Effects found on the body temporarily retained by police to aid possible identification. 6. Mr. T. P. Burial arranged after post mortem in the absence of any relatives. Council's costs recovered from deceased's estate. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT 1936, SECTION 122 The Council are authorised to remove and cleanse personal effects where the Medical Officer considers that the condition of such articles is likely to cause the spread of infectious disease. During the year, the Medical Officer visited the homes of 5 old people who were seriously ill or senile. Quantities of soiled bedding and personal clothing were found in each case and it was necessary for these articles to be regularly collected for cleansing in the Disinfecting Station and returned to the owners.

In order to obtain a punctual examination and rapid decision, the importers paid for a considerable number of samples to be examined. These results, like all others, were submitted for my approval in the first instance. The method of sampling was by batch numbers (signifying packing dates and factories). Where a sample showed evidence of contamination the whole batch was placed under detention and later either re-exported or released for pasteurisation and high temperature baking. The main importations were of frozen whole egg and laboratory results showed that 4.5% of the samples taken from these consignments contained Salmonellae.

This cheese was found to be New Zealand 2nd Grade and was marked " For Manufacturing Purposes Only." It was never intended to be sold directly for consumption but was to go for processing involving heat treatment and dilution. It had never previously caused trouble as far as is known. A City firm who sold the cheese to the hospitals concerned was prosecuted by the City Corporation and duly fined. The cause of the food poisoning was due to staphylococcal (enterotoxin) contamination of the cheese, as found by bacteriological examination of the remaining bulk from the hospital store. Bacteriological examination of all 2nd grade cheese in the wharves was undertaken and showed that high staphylococcal counts were present in many samples examined. A certain quantity of this cheese was declared unfit for human consumption; the remainder was released subject to being used at only 5% in dilution with other cheeses at the processing factory following heat treatment in the normal way. A fuller account will be given in the next annual report, by which time all the bacteriological results will be available as also the effects of the measures suggested to the producers to avoid this contamination.

A total of 147 samples was taken. Samples from four consignments showed bacteriological plate counts per gm. at 37° C in excess of 2,000,000 and these consignments were detained. Where a consignment showed a plate count of between 250,000 and 2,000,000 the importer was warned that the prawns must be used immediately after defrosting. No organisms of the Salmonella or Dysentery groups were found in any of the samples taken. Surface plate count at 37° C.
