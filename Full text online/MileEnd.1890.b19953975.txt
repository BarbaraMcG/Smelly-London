"The same thing occurred about a year ago when I "advised Mr. Mardorf, to put in a leathered flap similar to "that used to stop the tide from the drains of the river"side premises. "At that time the beer shop in Ben Jonson Road was "also flooded but title owner took my advice with regard "to fixing a flap, and at the last storm did not have any "flood water. "I enquired at the other houses in Harford Street "having basements but did not find any other case of "flooding. "The Harford Street sewer is three feet six inches in "height by two feet three inches in width. It crosses the "Ben Jonson Road and connects with the County "Council's main in Aston Street. This main runs along "Vincent Street, and passes under the Regent's Canal at "Carr Street wharf by means of a siphon. This siphon "is six feet high and has been in work over 60 years. "There are no means of clearing it out. "There is 110 stoppage in the Aston Street sewer but "there are 18 inches of mud.

To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, In laying before you a summary of the various works executed under the direction of my department, I have again to regret that common fund rates have prevented you from raising a sufficient sum for the work of footway paving, and trust that in the year we have just commenced it may be possible to raise at least £2,000 for some special works. In the past year your own workmen have been much engaged in relaying and redressing carriageway paving. The repaving of Harford Street and Ben Jonson Road, ordered a year since, has not yet been undertaken, as the necessary financial arrangements have not been made. PAVING WORKS. The following works have been executed by your own workmen: New Paving, squared and laid 9,421 ft. sup.

The cost was, for labour £1,195 8 10 „ material .£1,001 0 2 330 The repaying of the western portion of the Commercial Road has been done under contract with Mr. Griffiths, the cost of which has been £3665 19s. 4d. including keeping the work in repair for twelve months.

VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. ANNUAL REPORT UPONTHE PUBLIC HEALTH, and SANITARY CONDITION OF THE DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1890, by THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BYE. S. WHEATLEY, 176, MILE END ROAD, E. 1891. the thirty-fifth ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1890. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the Sanitary condition of the District, for the year 1890; and from which Report you will perceive that much valuable work has been done to improve the Sanitary condition of the Hamlet. AREA AND POPULATION. The District of Mile End Old Town, which is divided into Eastern and Western Districts has an area of 681 Acres, and in 1881 the number of Houses was 14,574, and the population 105,573. At the present time the number of Assessments is 17,200, and the population has been estimated at about 120,000. This estimate is not absolutely reliable in fact any estimate can be only aproximately correct owing to the census not having been taken since 1881. The most reliable basis for estimating populations of districts is that of the Registrar General, which is formed on the hypothesis that the rate of increase in the last intercensal period has been maintained since 1881. On this basis the population of this district would be 116,751, and for the purpose of this Report this number has been taken as affording the most correct estimate of the present population. 4 A quinquennial census would obviously be of much value in giving us more accurate knowledge of the precise population. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. The number of Births registered during the year was 4,006, being 32 more in number than last year, giving a Birth-rate equal to 35.1 per 1,000. The table No. 1, shows by comparison the Births and Birth-rate for the past ten years. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The mortality from all causes was 2,496 giving a Death-rate of 22.3 per 1000 per annum, that of the Metropolis being 20.3 for the same period, from table II. it will be seen that the above deaths include every death that has taken place of a Mile End Parishioner outside the district, whether Hospitals, Infirmaries, or Asylums, as well as those that have occurred in the district excepting those in the City of London Union, Bow Road, whose inmates belong to the City and not to Mile End. The death-rate 22.3, is the highest that has been recorded in Mile End for some six years, it should be explained that this is the first year that deaths in the Extra Metropolitan Asylums have been recorded in these reports, and if we consider the deaths that have taken place in Public Institutions outside the district, the mortality actually taking place in the district, would be reduced to something like 20.0 per 1,000. This high death rate is not due to any appreciable excess of zymotic diseases the deathrate from which is 27 per 1,000, that of last year was 2.3 per 1,000; but to an excess of deaths over which we as a sanitary body have 110 control, as for example diseases of the respiratory organs, etc.; during the first quarter of the year, there were 150 more deaths than the same quarter in the previous year, and was largely due to the severe weather as also the influenza epidemic, which was most trying to a population such as our own.

From Table II. It will be seen that 956 deaths occurred, under one year of age, being 383 Per cent. of the deaths at all ages; under five years the number was 1,278, being equal to 51.2 per cent. of such deaths. Infants mortality has been considered by some to be a criterion to the sanitary condition of a district, and although this is so to an extent, yet as we well know amongst a population such as ours, there are many causes other than neglected sanitation which contributes largely to our death roll, not the least of which is early improvident and unsuitable marriages. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. It is with the diseases of a Zymotic character that we are principally interested, as they are of a more or less preventable nature; and it is the frequency or otherwise of these diseases, that is to an extent taken as a standard as to the sanitary condition of a district, especially when they are epidemic or sporadic in one particular district. From the mortality table, (Table II.) it will be seen that the whole of the deaths from these diseases, was equal to 12.9 of the total number of deaths, and equal to a death rate of 27 per 1000 per annum. SCARLET FEVER. The mortality from Scarlet Fever has been very low, seeing that we had 403 cases notified to us, out of which number only 28 deaths took place. I may say the disease was scattered all over the Hamlet, and was of a mild type. It was not found necessary to close any of the Public Schools in the District. DIPHTHERIA. This disease has been during the past few years on the increase, especially since 1887. We have had notified to us 138 cases during the last 12 months, from the various Medical men of the district. On examining the premises where these diseases were* reported to have occurred, in many of them sanitary defects were found, and in a large number the same cistern was used for drinking purposes as that supplying the closet, and which (cisterns) had not been in some cases, cleansed tor something like two vears. The number of deaths from this disease was 44, being equal to a death rate of .3 per 1000 per annum. Now that cases of this disease are admitted into the Asylum Board Hospitals, together with a compulsory notification of the same, it is hoped that the constant increase that has taken place of late years, may be checked. 6 TYPHUS FEVER. There were 2 cases of Typhus Fever reported during the year. It is probable that one of these cases was mistaken Typhoid Fever ; the other was this disease as far as can be made out, but as to its origin it could not be traced, although strenuous steps were taken with this object. It is however satisfactorv to know that no other case occurred in this locality, and that neither of the reported cases proved fatal. TYPHOID FEVER. During the last year there were 127 cases reported to me, and out of which only 22 proved fatal, this number is very small indeed spread over a year, and in a large district like our own ; the disease was never of an endemic character, and proper precautions were taken to prevent as far as possible in ever case the spread of the disease. The following table explains itself: Table III. Shewing the number of Deaths Registered during the past Five years from the principal infectious diseases including Diarrhoea.

The above Act now being in force all over the Metropolis, cases of infectious diseases are notified to each Medical Officer of Health soon after it occurs, it will be seen from the adjoining table, a large number of these diseases have been reported to me during the past 12 months. I am happy to say there has been not the slightest friction between the Medical men of the district and myself in the working of this Act. We have co-operated amicably both as regards removal of cases to isolation hospitals where necessary, as also in the disinfection of clothing, and other sanitary measures, for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hamlet, and I feel sure much good will be found to accrue from such a necessary measure as the above.

It is under the above Act that most of the sanitary improvements in dwelling houses and premises, have been effected during the last 12 months; as will be seen from Table IV. the works executed were both numerous and varied in character. In 19 instances the orders of the Vestry not having been complied with, and the premises being in my opinion in such a condition as to be injurious to health, the Vestry ordered summonses to be taken out against the owners, with the following results: 22, Knott Street Order made by magistrate to do work in 14 days. 26 „ Ditto ditto 33 „ Work being in progress summons was withdrawn. 38 „ Ditto ditto 40 „ Ditto ditto 53 „ Order made to do the necessary work in 28 days. 55 „ Work being in progress summons was withdrawn. 57 „ Order made to do the necessary work in 14 days 61 „ Ditto ditto in 28 days. 70 „ Ditto ditto in 14 days. 2, Cottage Court, Order to do necessary work in 14 Adelina Grove days. 3 „ Ditto ditto 4 „ Ditto ditto 50, Ocean Street Order to do the necessary work in 14 days. 52 ,, Ditto ditto 58 „ Ditto ditto 80 „ Ditto ditto 82 „ Ditto ditto 86 „ Ditto ditto With regard to the houses in Cottage Court the landlord instead of doing the necessary work closed the houses; they remain so at the present time. All the premises above mentioned in Ocean Street, the nuisances were abated within the time named in the order. In Knott Street the various works which were necessary, were carried out in all the houses except two, in respect to which further proceedings will have to be taken. It will be seen from the adjoining Table the Sanitary staff have been actively engaged during the last twelve months, the 9 houses principally visited were those which had not been taken in hand in the first house to house visitation, and now every house has been visited and means taken to provide such houses with a proper water-supply to the W. C. and other sanitary improvements. There are many houses that require frequent visiting, especially those inhabited by the poorer classes, that our small sanitary staff is fully employed. I hope that before long our staff of inspectors may be augmented, so that the whole ot the district may be inspected at more frequent intervals. SUMMARY OF SANITARY WORKS CARRIED OUT BY THE SANITARY INSPECTORS DURING THE YEAR 1890. Number of houses inspected 3864 Notices served 2293 Water supplies to closets 1390 Yards paved 174 Receptacles for dust provided 254 Drains trapped 80 „ cleansed 259 ,, tested 37 „ abolished and new constructed 92 „ flushed 38 Offensive accumulation removed 13 Areas drained 9 Stables drained 9 Water supplies for domestic purposes disconnected from cistern supplying closet 249 Waste pipes of sinks disconnected from drains 56 Number of complaints received 115 Number of houses cleansed 96 New pans and traps to closets 3 New closets built 7 Houses disinfected 217 Articles of bedding &c. disinfected 958 Summonses taken re sanitary works, underground rooms, &c. 33 Occupation of underground rooms abolished 21 Magistrate's orders obtained 12 Swine removed 2 Overcrowding abolished 1 Houses closed 3 Cesspools abolished 2 to UNDERGROUND DWELLINGS. In one ward in our district viz. the West Ward, we have been aware for some time past, that the underground rooms in many of the houses are used as sleeping apartments, there can be but little doubt that owing to these rooms being 8 to 10 feet below the level of the street with no through ventilation, the air gets vitiated to a marked degree, and so is very detrimental to the health of the occupants. Notices have from time to time been served on the owners and occupiers of such underground rooms, to discontinue their being used as dwellings, but with little permanent effect, the difficulty we have felt, is that owing to our visiting them in the day time, there has been little trace of many of them being used as such, although we were fairly certain of their being so occupied. This state of things was fully considered by the Sanitary Committee in August last, and it was determined to make a midnight visit, and so get reliable evidence to ground proceedings. On August 22nd, 10.30 p.m. several members of the Sanitary Committee, your Sanitary Inspector, and myself, visited a large number of these houses, and in 26 of them visited, beds were found in the underground rooms, and in many cases children were asleep, four or five in one bed, as well as adults; having got this information, notices were at once served on the owners and occupiers, and after some three weeks, another visit was paid to the same houses as before at 11 p.m. when it was found in 19 cases the occupants had discontinued using them as sleeping rooms, whilst in seven cases they were occupied as on our first visit. The Sanitary Committee at their next meeting recommended the Vestry to take legal proceedings in the seven instances; this was done under the sec. 103 Metropolis Management Act of which the following is a summary. " Any room of a house, the surface of the floor of which rootn is more than three feet below the surface of the roadway of the adjoining street . . . when such room . ' . . is or has been occupied separately as a dwelling, at or before the time of the passing of tho Act (14th August, 1855), may continue to be so let or occupied if it possess " certain " requisites, " viz., (1) An area of specified dimensions, etc. (2) An open fire-place with proper flue, and (3) a window of specified size made to open. The section further enacts that 'no such room . . . not so let or occupied as aforesaid, at or before the time of the passing of the Act, shall be bo let or occupied unless it possess" certain " requisites," viz. (1) Unless the room be at least seven feet in height; (2) Unless the ceiling be at least one foot above the surface of the footway of the nearest adjoining street; (3) Unless there be an open area; 4) Unless the area be effectually drained; (5) Unless there be appurtenant to the room the use of a water closet and an ash-pit; (6) Unless there be a fire-place with proper chimney or flue; and (7) Unless there be an opening window of certain specified dimensions. There is a proviso that there may be steps, necessary for access io the room; and stops over or across the area for access to any building above the room, if the said steps bo so placed as not to be over or across the window. The penalty to which anyone letting or occupying an underground room contrary to the Act is liable, is a sum not exceeding 20s. per diem. Every room in which any person passes the night is deemed to be occupied as a dwelling •within the meaning of the Act. 11 Summonses were at once applied for and obtained against the seven owners and occupiers, and on October 15th the Clerk, your Inspector, and myselt, attended the Thames Police Court; alter several adjournments the magistrate heard the evidence of your Inspector, and held that " unless it could be proved that these underground rooms were exclusively occupied as living and sleeping apartments, by the occupants summoned, there could be no case against them; and as regards the owners, it must be proved that he let such underground rooms, as separate dwellings, that being the magistrates decision,and as we were not prepared to prove such facts, the cases were dismissed without costs. It is much to be regretted that the Act is so weak when such a vital question is at stake as the hygienic condition of the masses, more especially those of tender years, it seems absurd to think the legislature intended that a man could say, rent a cellar and a top attic in a house, and should be allowed to let his family sleep in such cellar, simply because he did not use the cellar exclusively for living and sleeping purposes ; I may say as far as our district is concerned, this Section of the Act will to a large extent be inoperative as the difficulties in proving what is required are very great, especially as most of these rooms are occupied by foreign Jews, who are frequently moving from one district to another. After the above decision the Vestry very wisely resolved to call the President of the Local Government Board's attention to the matter, and it is to be hoped the Act may be amended very speedily. SANITARY LEGISLATION DURING THE YEAR 1890. During the year 1890 two most important Acts have been passed ; I refer to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and the Infectious Disease Prevention Act. The first named Act is divided into Part I. and Part II. Part I. deals principally with unhealthy areas, and is no doubt meant to refer to large areas that are of Metropolitan as well as Local importance. Part II. may well be sub-divided into at least three parts. First, single buildings that are unfit for human habitation, either temporarily or permanently. Secondly, obstructive buildings; Thirdly, small'insanitary areas, in fact one might say that part two of the Act applies only to such houses and small areas, as are of primary importance to each locality. Under Section 30 of the Act it states " It shall be the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of every district, to represent to the Local Authority of that district any dwelling house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health, as to be unfit for human habitation." It is also made competent under Section 31 " for any four householders living in or near any street, to complain to the Medical Officer of 12 Health, of any house that appears to them to be injurious to health so as to be unfit for human habitaton," and it shall be the duty of such Medical Officer of Health to inspect such house, and report to the Local Authority. As will be seen from another part of my report I have taken action in some seventeen houses under Section 30. Section 38 referring to obstructive buildings states: 38.—(1) If a medical officer of health finds that any building within his district, although not in itself unfit for human habitation, is so situate that by reason of its proximity to or contact with any other buildings it causes one of the following effects, that is to say,— (a) It 8tops ventilation, or otherwise makes or conduces to make such other buildings to be in a condition unfit for human habitation or dangerous or injurious to health ; or (£) It prevents proper measures from being carried into effect for remedying any nuisance injurious to health or other evils complained of in respect of such other buildings; in any such case, the medical officer of hoalth shall represent to the local authority the particulars relating to such first-mentioned building (in this Act referred to as "an obstructive building '") stating that in his opinion it is expedient that the obstructive building should be pulled down. I may say in reference to the above section, although I have not yet made an official representation under this 38th section, I contemplate doing so shortly. The section dealing with small insanitary areas reads as follows: Scheme for Reconstruction. 39.—(1) In any of the following cases, that is to say— (a) where an order for the demolition of a building has been made in pursuance of this part of this Act, and it appears to the local authority that it would be beneficial to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwelling-houses if the area of the dwelling house of which such building forms part were used for all or any of the following purposos, that is to say, either— (i) dedicated as a highway or open space, or (ii) appropriated, sold, or let for the erection of dwellings for the working classes, or (iii) exchanged with other neighbouring land which is more suitable for the erection of such dwellings, and on exchange will be appropriated, sold or let for such erection; or (b) where it appears to the local authority that the closeness, narrowness, and bad arrangement or bad condition of any buildings, or the want of light, air, ventilation, or proper conveniences, or any other sanitary defect in any buildings is dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants either of the said buildings or of the neighbouring buildings, and that the demolition or the reconstruction and re-arrangement of the said buildings or of some of them is necessary to remedy the said evils, and that the area comprising those buildings and the yards, outhouses, and appurtenances thereof, and the site thereof, is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy area under Part I. of this Act, the local authority shall pass a resolution to the above effect and direct a scheme to be prepared for the improvement of the said area. 13 It will be observed that under this section.it is not necessary tor an official representation to be made by me in any of the above cases, but I might say that on November 19th in one of 111 ordinary fortnightly reports to the Sanitary Committee I brought to their notice the closeness, and narrowness, and bad arrangement, and bad condition, of the buildings, known as Lomas Buildings as the following report will show. To the Committee appointed under the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890. I beg to bring before your notice the insanitary condition of the houses known as Lomas Buildings. These buildings consist of two rows of houses, fifteen on each side, situated between Ben Jonson Road and Mary Street in the Centre Ward. The entrance from Ben Jonson Road is by means of a covered way with a dwelling house over it. The footway between the two rows of houses is 10 feet wide. Taking first the fifteen houses on the West side each house consists of two small rooms 011 each of the two floors, a larger one in front, and a scullery behind 011 the ground floor, and two bed-rooms above. The front living rooms are 10 feet long 10 feet wide and 6 feet 9 inches in height, the floor boards are on the ground, no ventilation beneath, so that in many of them the floor boards are rotten and damp, the walls in most of them are filthily dirty, the rooms are dark, and suffer both from want of light, and air, owing to the close proximity of the houses opposite ; the yards are very small, and few have dustbins, the houses are mostlv occupied by costermongers with families. On the East side the rooms are rather larger than those on the opposite side, these rooms suffer from want of light and air, the walls are more or less dilapidated, in several of them the walls are damp and in five the floor boards are laid on the ground, without proper ventilation underneath, so that looking on these buildings as a whole, they are so situated that by their closeness, narrowness, bad condition of the houses, and also by their want of light and ventilation, they are in my opinion in such a condition as to be prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, I would suggest to you the necessity of taking into consideration the report, with a view of treating the property, under the 39th section of the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890, for if we have any insanitary areas in the Hamlet, this certainly is the first one that should be remedied. The Sanitary Committee have surveyed these buildings and are of an opinion that an improvement scheme ought to be carried out, they have the matter at the present time under discussion. 14 I have very briefly given you the principal purposes of the Act, and although its machinery is complicated its intentions are good. Unhealthy dwelling houses can be dealt with more expeditiously under this act than formerly under the cumbersome Torrens Act as we have already proved, but with reference to the other parts of the act sufficent time has not elapsed to enable the various local authorities to take proceedings under them. Under this Act the local authority are enpowered to appoint a Committee, for the purposes of the Act, this the Vestry have done, and have delegated the Sanitary Committee to act for them, and take all proceedings under the Act, with the exception of those requiring the Seal of the Vestry. I may say up to now this arrangement has worked very well, the Committee have promptly dealt with all representations made to them. The above Act is viewed with such importance that the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council in November last invited a Conference of representatives of the Vestries and District Boards, to consider the above Act. This Conference was held on December 5th and every Vestry in London was represented by two delegates from its members, its Clerk and Medical Officer of Health. Mr. Coker and Mr. Lyon were deputed to attend on behalf of your board as well as the Clerk and myself. On opening the Conference, the Chairman (Earl Compton) remarked that the object of the Conference, was that some common understanding might be arrived at by the Council and the District Boards, as to the best methods of proceeding under the Act, and also to consider some of the principal provisions of the same. After considerable discussion on the various sections the chief interest was centred in dealing with houses that were unfit for human habitation, and the only resolutions that were adopted by the Conference, were as follows : 1.—That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that some common understanding should be arrived at between the County Council and the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, as to the condition or defects which would render a house, either permanently or temporarily "so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation," within the meaning of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 2.—That with a view to arriving at such common understanding, the Medieal Officer of Health to the London County Council be requested to convene a meeting of the Medical Officers of Health of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis in order that they may report generally on the subject to a subsequent meeting of this Conference, and, if practicable, submit for consideration a list or schedule of the conditions and defects which m<»y be considered to render a house " so dangerous or injurious ro health, as to be unfit for human habitation." After the above resolutions were passed, the Conference adjourned. In accordance with the 2nd resolution a meeting was convened of the Medical Officer of Health to the County Council, at which I attended, and subsequently the Committee drew up the following report, which was presented to the second meeting of the Conference : 15 " V\ hether a house is dangerous to health mainly, depends upon— (а) Site and surroundings. (б) Construction. (e) Age and general want of repair. (d) Nuisances. (a) Site. A dwelling-house built in a hollow or in a situation not admitting effectual drainage, or exposed to malarious influences, or built in a manner or on soil which causes or permits the air to be contaminated by injurious gases, might be properly represented under section 30 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. "The fact that a dwelling-house is built on a site so surrounded by buildings that access of sufficient light and air is impossible, would in our opinion be a good ground for representation. (b) Construction. " Under this head would be classed original defect of plan; for example, a dwelling-house improperly ventilated or lighted, or with the closet and dustbin so situated as to cause nuisance within the house. "Any condition which results in permanent dampness. •Such faulty construction of chimney flues as permits products of combustion from adjoining premises to permanently contaminate the air of living-rooms. (e) Age and general ivant of repair. "This, when it reaches a degree of dilapidation, is obviously a just cause for representation. (d) Nuisances. " Bad drainage, faulty closets, tilth per se, &c., are in our opinion grounds for action rather under the Nuisances Removal and Sanitary Acts, but when affecting a whole dwelling-house or when combined with faults of site and construction and general want of repair, they justify action also under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. " In all the above cases tlic question of ' degree ' comes in ; it is, indeed, this question of degree that renders precise definition impossible ; general principles can alone be laid down.' After the report had been received, and considered, the Conference passed a vote of thanks to the Medical Officer of Health, for the report after which the Conference closed without having come to a " common understanding as to the conditions or defects which would render a house, either permanently or temporarily so dangerous to health, as to be unfit for human habitation within the meaning of the Act." So that after all the discussion about the matter it is quite evident that each particular house must be taken 011 its merits as to its being in a state unfit for human habitation. 16 THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION ACT, 1890. The above Act is one of the most important Acts that has ever been passed, and if properly carried out in this district I feel sure will be very beneficial to the inhabitants in checking the spread of infectious diseases, I presented the following report to the Sanitary Committee on December 10th, 1890. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, At your last meeting I intimated that I would bring up a report on the provisions of "the Diseases Prevention Act, 1890." I might point out to you that this Act is really an adjunct to the "Notification Act, 1889" and ought to be worked with it. The Act confers on us, as a Sanitary Authority, additional powers and means in order to prevent the spread of infectious disease, and, if it be carried out in its entirety, I feel sure it will succeed in its evident object. I only intend in this short resume to deal with a few of the principal sections, in order to show what additional work will be thrust on the Sanitary Department. Section 4 states: "Where sufficient evidence is shown that any infectious cases are attributable to the milk supply from any dairy within or without the district, the M.O.H. is empowered, after obtaining an order from a magistrate, to inspect such dairy," and, if accompanied by a veterinary surgeon, inspect the animals. If it be the opinion of the M.O.H. that the infectious disease is carried by the milk supply, a report is to be made to the Local Authority, accompanied with the report of the veterinary surgeon, and the Local Authorities may give notice to the diaryman to appear before them to show cause why an order should not be made to stop the supply of such milk, and, if he fail to do so, an order may be made compelling him to stop such supply. This order however may be withdrawn on the Local Authority being satisfied that the milk supply has been changed. This section of the Act is, to my mind, a most complicated one, and if ever the necessity arise for setting this part of the Act in motion, I fear, before any definite action could be taken, the delay would be so great that the consequences might be very disastrous. Section 5 states:— (1) Where the Medical Officer of health of any Local Authority, or any other registered Medical Practitioner certifies that the cleansing and disinfecting of any house or part thereof, and of any articles therein likely to retain infection, would tend to prevent or check infectious disease, the Clerk to the Local Authority shall give notice in writing to the owner or occupier of such house or part thereof that the same and any such articles therein will be cleansed and disinfected by the Local Authority at the cost of such owner or occupier, unless 17 he informs the Local Authority within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the notice that he will cleanse and disinfect the house or part thereof, and any such articles therein to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, within a time fixed in the notice. (2) If within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the notice the person to whom the notice is given does not inform the Local Authority as aforesaid, or it having so informed the Local Authority he fails to have the house or part thereof, and any such articles disinfected as aforesaid within the time fixed in the notice, the house or part thereof shall be cleansed and disinfected by the Officers of the Local Authority, under the superintendence of the Medical Officer of Health, and the expenses incurred may be recovered from the owner thereof or occupier in a summary manner (3) Provided that where the owner or occupier of any such house or part thereof is unable in the opinion of the Local Authority, or of their Medical Officer of Health, effectually to cleanse and disinfect such house or part thereof, and any article therein likely to retain infection, the same may, without any such notice beine given as aforesaid, but with the consent of the owner or occupier, be cleansed and disinfected by the Officers of and at the cost of the Local Authority. It will be seen that this and the following section are the most important with which we shall have to deal. The cases of infectious disease that are notified to us are of two kinds. First, those that are removed to the hospital or die at their homes. Second, those patients that are treated at their own homes during their whole illness. As we receive immediate notice of those of the first class, a certificate can be at once given by me to the clerk to certifythat it is necessary to have the room at once disinfected. Notice has then to be served on the occupier that, unless he inform us that he will disinfect the premises to my satisfaction, it is incumbent that the Local Authority do so at the cost of such occupier. In the second class of cases—those treated at their own homes—the difficulty will be to ascertain when the patient is sufficiently well to have the room and clothing, &c., disinfected. There is, however, provision made in this section, whithout such aforesaid notice, for the Local Authority to carry out disinfection at its own cost. (6) Any Local Authority, or the Medical Officer of Health of any Local Authority generally empowered by the Authority in that behalf, may by notice in writing require the owner of any bedding, clothing, or other articles which have been exposed to the infection of any infectious disease to cause the same to be delivered over to an Officer of the Local Authority for removal for the purpose of disinfection; and any person who fails to comply with such a requirement shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds. The bedding, clothing, and articles shall be disinfected by the Authority, and shall be brought back and delivered to the owner free of charge, and if any of them suffer any unnecessary damage the authority shall compensate the owner for the same, and the amount of compensation shall be recoverable in, and in case of dispute shall be settled by, a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. It will be seen that Section 6 deals exclusively with disinfection of bedding, clothing, &c. 18 In my opinion this cannot be carried out thoroughly or effectually at any private residence, so that in all cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria, the infection of which is principally conveyed by means of the clothing, it will be necessary for the Vestry to carry this out, and, to do so, some method will have to be adopted to find out when such process could take place. (7) Every person who shall cease to occupy any house, room, or part of a house, in which any person has, within six weeks previously, been suffering from any infectious disease, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfaction of a registered medical practitioner, as testified by a certificate signed by him, or without first giving to the owner of such house, room, or part of a house, notice ot the previous exigence of such disease, and every person ceasing to occupy any house, room, or part of a house, and who on being questioned by the owner thereof, or by any person negotiating for the hire of such house, room, or part of a house, as to the tact ot there having within six weeks previously been therein, any person suffering from any infectious disease knowing makes a false answer to such question, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds. (13) Any person who shall knowingly cast, or cause, or permit to be cast into any ash-pit, ash-tub, or other receptacle for the deposit of refuse matter, any infectious rubbish, without previous disinfection, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act. (14) Where Sections seven and thirteen of this Act, or either of them are in force in any district, the Local Authority shall give notice of the provisions thereof to the occupier of any house in which they are aware that there is a person suffering from an infectious disease. Sections 7 and 13 should be taken together, as it will be seen by section 14 that it is necessary' for the Local Authority to give notice of the provisions of these two sections to the occupier of any house where we have notice that any person is suffering from an infectious disease. (15) The Local Authority shall, from time to time, provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation, with any necessary attendants for the members of any family in which any infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Local Authority. It is this section that will cause considerable stir in some parts of the metropolis. In our own district there are undoubtedly cases occurring in which people who only occupy one room, and I take it that in such cases as these shelter will have to be found. And now, Gentleman, having given you a short synopsis of the Act, it becomes my duty to point out to you what is required to so carry this Act out as to be a means of protection to the public health in the district. In each house where infectious disease takes place, it is necessary for the premises to be at once visited, and an examination made as to its sanitary condition, and a record to be kept of the same, and notice should be left stating the contents of sections 7 and 13 of this Act, and any other sections of the Act that may be necessary; and in order to give us notice when the premises 19 and clothing can be disinfected, some such ready method as a post-card should be left for the patients to fill in when recovered, and it this is not received within a certain time, the premises should again be visited. In every case of typhoid fever and diphtheria the drains ought thoroughly to be tested by the smoke apparatus, and, although perhaps only a small percentage of them may be found to be defective, the remedying of such would amply repay the extra amount of labour expended. Of course, where the occupiers could show that they could disinfect the rooms themselves it would only be necessary for us to disinfect the clothing, and this should be done in each case of small pox, typhus fever, diphtheria, and scarlet fever. To carry out the above it will readily be seen that our present sanitary staff is not sufficient to do this, as I consider the large areas that are allocated to the present Inspectors, to carry out the inspections of which in an efficient manner, is quite sufficient to occupy the whole of their time. I may say the above conclusions have not been arrived at hastily, as during the last few months I have visited a large number of these cases, and, from what I have seen, I feel convinced that the above suggestions should be carried out in their entirety. To give you a little illustration as to our present system, during the months of August, September, and October, there were in 200 cases notified to us. of which number we only disinfected 41, and 42 were certified by medical men as not being necessary; so you will see that, in all probability, fifty per cent. of the cases notified never got disinfected at all. I am, your obedient servant, T. TAYLOR, DEC. 10th, 1890. Medical Officer of Health. On the Committee considering the above report they quite agreed with the various suggestions thrown out by me as to the future working of this Act, and I shall endeavour with the cooperation of the Inspectors to take all possible steps towards mitigating the spread of these diseases. 20 PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT Of houses reported to the Committee by the Medical Officer of Health as being dangerous or injurious to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation.

Under the above Act I reported the following houses as being in my opinion unfit for human habitation, No. 438, 442, 444, 446, Mile End Road, they were all more or less dilapidated and damp, the Surveyor reported on their condition, and advised various structural alterations to be carried out. The Agent for the owner appeared at the Vestry, and agreed to carry out the various works suggested by the Surveyor, these were subsequently done, and the houses are now in a habitable condition. Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, Exmouth Court, were reported by me to the Vestry as being unfit for human habitation, the walls were more or less dilapidated and damp, the roofs defective, no proper ventilation under the floor-boards, etc. The Surveyor subsequently reported and advised various structural alterations, these were carried out, and the houses were made habitable. Nos. 5, 9, 19, 21, 58, 66, 68, Knott Street, were in May last reported by me to the Vestry as being unfit for human habitation; the Surveyor also reported advising various structural alterations as being necessary, to remedy the defect complained of in my report. The Vestry made an order to do the various necessary works in each case, most of the works was carried out, but owing to Nos. 19 and 21, not being made habitable, it was considered best to bring No. 21 under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and 19 under the Nusiances Removal Act. The result is the Houses are at the present time shut up. No. 23, Eagle Place, this house owing to its defective roof and general dilapidated condition was reported to the Vestry as being unfit for human habitation. The Surveyor also reported to the Vestry suggesting various structural alterations, an order was made and the work was subsequently carried out. BAKEHOUSES. The duty of inspecting the Bakehouses in the Hamlet having devolved upon me as per order of the Local Government Board 1889, I have visited all of them during the last twelve months, numbering 86, and on the whole found them to be in a cleanly condition, in only five cases was it necessary to serve notice for cleansing, four of which were complied with, the other one on my reporting to the Vestry the work was not done they ordered summons to be taken out against the occupier, the work was however carried out before the summons was issued. THE COW HOUSE AND SLAUGHTER HOUSE. The Inspectors and myself have visited all the cow houses 39 in number, also the slaughter houses numbering 20 during 23 the past year, and they were all being kept in such a good sanitary state, that no opposition to their being relicensed was offered by us. SANITARY CONDITION OF THE VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS IN MILE END OLD TOWN. In my last annual report I brought to your notice the results of my inspection of the Board Schools in the Hamlet. I now lay before you the report of the Voluntary Schools, and as will be seen on comparing the two reports, the Voluntary Schools were much behind those of the Board Schools in their sanitary condition, but I am glad to say that most of the defects then found to exist are now remedied. st. luke's schools. This School is that connected with the Rev. Wallace's Church. It accommodates 290 Girls and Infants, and 90 Boys. The school rooms are clean, well lighted, and well ventilated. With regard to the Girls' and Infants' "W.C's," the flushing apparatus is very defective, traps to pans useless, and there is no ventilation. On the Boys' side there is no water supply laid on to the closets, and they are not properly flushed. st. paul's voluntary schools. This School accommodates 150 Girls and Infants and 100 Boys. The rooms are well lighted and ventilated. The flushing apparatus of both Boys' and Girls' closets are very inadequate, whilst the closets themselves are badly constructed and wanting in cleanliness. The channel is so constructed as not to allow any water to remain in it. The trapping of the drain is bad. In the School Houses adjoining, the water supply for domestic purposes is same as that used for water closets. The sink pipes run into the drain causing an intolerable stench. st. peter's voluntary schools. This School accommodates 200 Boys. There are 5 W.C's, which are well constructed, and provided with proper water supply, but require to be flushed more frequently than is at present done. The floor of urinal requires to be made with a proper slope towards the trap. All the School rooms are clean and well ventilated, except upper room form "1," which walls and ceilings are dirty and and require cleansing. 2 4 red coat schools. These Schools are well lighted and ventilated, and the sanitary arrangements are all that can be required. infants' schools, redman's row. These Schools are in a cleanly condition, and the sanitary arrangements to closets are all that can be desired, the works having been completed that I suggested some time ago. st. thomas schools, arbor square. The walls, passages and ceilings, require cleansing badly. In the Infants' class rooms the walls are in a filthy condition. In the top floor Boys' Department, the rooms are in a dirty state, and require cleansing. The W.C's are in a cleanly condition and have a proper water supply, but are not sufficently ventilated. the jewish board school. This School accommodates 350 Boys, 250 Girls, and 172 Infants. The class rooms are well lighted and ventilated, and are in a cleanly condition. The water closets are sufficient in number, cleanly, and fitted with an adequate water supply. copperfield free schools. This is a very large School, capable of accommodating 780 children, 550 Boys, and 350 Girls. The whole of the school rooms are clean, well lighted and ventilated. The water closet accommodation is adequate, and flushing apparatus satisfactory. the german roman catholic school, union st. These Schools are for the accommodation of German Roman Catholic children, the school rooms are well lighted and ventilated, and in a cleanly condition. The water closets are provided with automatic flushing apparatus. In concluding this my Annual Report I have again to thank the members of the Sanitary Committee and the Vestry generally, for their support and assistance during the past year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. SANITARY INSPECTORS' REPORT for the year 1890-91. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town.
