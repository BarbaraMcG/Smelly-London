LIBRARY MIT21 AC4413(1)MITCHAM BOROUGH OF MITCHAM REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the YEAR 1952 BOROUGH OF MITCHAM REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the YEAR 1952 Mitcham : H. G. Mather, Ltd., Caxton Works, Lower Green. 3 Borough of Mitcham HEALTH REPORT FOR 1952 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting my annual report for the year 1952. The general health in the Borough has been good, and most of the statistics compare very favourably with those for England and Wales. There was no outbreak of infectious disease to cause special alarm. The infectious diseases notifications were much reduced because of the great reduction in measles, which was exceptionally large the year before, and to a less extent with whooping cough. Poliomyelitis affected four people, but they were fairly mild cases. Very much on the preventive side for the third year in succession, there was no case of diphtheria, and only two in the past six years, whereas before that cases averaged sixty per year. It was pleasing to note that deaths from tuberculosis were the lowest on record, the death rate being 0.19 per 1,000 population, compared with 0.33 last year and 0.24 for England and Wales. The figures for this industrial area are not usually as favourable. The sixteen cases of dysentery were mostly single cases diagnosed on clinical grounds, not confirmed bacteriologically. The birth rate of 13.57, after correction by the comparability factor to correspond with the average age and sex grouping of the whole population, becomes 12.62, which compares with 15.3 for England and Wales. 4 The actual death rate of 9.37, which after applying the comparability factor becomes 10.89, compares with 11.3 for the whole of the country. The infant mortality rate is the lowest recorded in Mitcham, and is 19.8 compared with 27.6 for England and Wales, which itself is the lowest ever recorded for this country. The death rate from cancer continues to rise and is now the highest ever, being 1.91 per 1,000 population, equal to that in 1945. I wish to thank the Chairmen of the Committees for their friendly support, and all the members of the staff for their loyalty and service throughout the year. I have the honour to be, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient servant, A. R. GRAHAM, Medical Officer of Health.

It is a fairly flat and low lying area, with some 600 acres of open space including the 440 acres of Mitcham Common. The River Wandle, which forms the south-west and western boundary, separates Mitcham from Beddington & Wellington in the south and Carshalton in the west, as it runs a northwards course towards the Thames. The soil of Mitcham consists of up to four feet of top-soil, with about ten feet of gravel sub-soil, except for one or two parts where London clay comes to the surface. Below the gravel, London clay extends downwards for 200 to 300 feet. Mitcham, with nearly 300 factories, has a great variety of industries, of which probably the chief ones are paint and varnish, chemical, engineering, margarine and dairy products. Unemployment for the year was not high, although somewhat increased from 1951, especially towards the end of the year. 8 Although Mitcham is chiefly a working class area, there are no real slums and no back-to-back houses. Nearly two-thirds of the houses have been built since 1921 and more than 50 per cent. of all the roads are tree-lined. Mitcham is now a fairly densely populated area, with the few available building sites being rapidly filled up. STATISTICS. Live Births.

Permanent buildings built by the Council before the war— 1,461. Permanent buildings built by the Council after the war— 1,308. Other Housing Accommodation Available: — A. Requisitioned and sundry properties 394 B. Temporary buildings, Arcon bungalows 345 C. Hutments, 320 originally, now reduced to 219 26 D. Gunsite hutments, 61 originally, now reduced to 26 E. Therefore total number of properties acquired during and since the war is 2,292 Number of People Rehoused. About 8,300 applicants have registered since 1945, and the current list is still about 2,500, so that some 5,800 applicants have been dealt with. The actual number of people including children who have been rehoused is about 6,000. Types of Accommodation. The Nissen huts and gunsite hutments were built to last only a few years, and do not always give protection against the weather, although much has been spent on improvements. The numbers are gradually being reduced and the Mitcham Borough Council is acquiring the sites for permanent housing purposes. The temporary Arcon bungalows, however, give very good housing accommodation. The chief new development is that of building large blocks of flats to get the greatest number of families rehoused with n limited building space available. A housing estate is also to be constructed outside the borough at Banstead in conjunction with the neighbouring authorities of Merton and Morden Urban District Council and the Borough of Sutton and Cheam. The Mitcham Borough Council has also started the building of aged persons' dwellings. The post-war housing is also making provision for the communal needs of the occupants of the new estates by proposed community centres, erection of garages, etc. 1.

Scarlet Fever The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 225 as compared with 111 in 1951, equivalent to a case rate of 3.36 per 1,000 population. This disease has continued mild in character; no death due to this cause was recorded. Of the total number of cases notified 78 were treated in hospital and 147 were treated at home. Diphtheria No case of diphtheria was notified for the third year in succession and only two in the past six years, whereas before that cases averaged sixty per year. Immunisation and reinforcing doses were available to every school child whose parents gave consent. Diphtheria Immunisation There are three clinics within relatively easy reach of everyone, as well as immunisation sessions held in the schools. Efforts have continued during the year to obtain the immunisation of every child before the first birthday. The health visitors urge mothers at the welfare centres, and at home visits, to have their children immunised, making special visits in difficult cases. A birthday greeting letter is sent at the approach of the first birthday, making an appointment for immunisation for those infants not yet immunised. The following figures show the number of children immunised and reinforced during the year (the figure for immunisation includes those who received combined injections against diphtheria and whooping cough):— 41  Immunised. Reinforced. Total. Under five years 661 34 695 Five to 14 years 72 2,275 2,347 Totals 733 2,309 3,042 The percentage immunised is as follows:— Under five 49.15% Five—fourteen 81.69% Whooping Cough Immunisation This is carried out at the same clinics as diphtheria immunisation, but special visits to schools are not made as this inoculation is intended primarily for children under five years old. The following figures show the number of children immunised and reinforced from the commencement of the Surrey County Council scheme on 1st August, 1952 (this includes those children who received the combined diphtheria and whooping cough treatment): — The following figures show the number of the child population considered immunised at 31st December, 1952: — Age at 31.12.52 i.e. born in year Under 1 1952 1 1951 2 1950 3 1949 4 1948 5 to 9 1943-1947 10 to 14 1938-1942 Total under 15 Number immunised 25 478 549 703 850 3917 3599 10121 Estimated mid-year population 1952 5300 9290 14590 42 Age at date of final injection (as regards A) or of re-inforcing injection (as regards B) Under 1 1 2 3 4 A.

No case of typhoid fever was notified during the year. Diarrhœa and Enteritis Under Two Years of Age One death was registered during the year. Food Poisoning Outbreaks There were two family outbreaks which affected two in each family and six single cases. It was not possible to identify the causative organism or be certain of the food responsible. Encephalitis Lethargica No case was notified during the year. Erysipelas Fourteen cases were notified. Four cases were removed to hospital. Puerperal Pyrexia Twenty-three cases were notified during the year. The increased number has followed the wider scope of the definition of puerperal pyrexia under the 1951 regulations. 43 Pneumonia Twenty-six cases of primary pneumonia were notified during the year. The number of deaths from all forms of pneumonia, some of which are not notifiable, was 29, of which 17 were males and 12 females. Meningococcal Infections. One case occurred during 1952. Influenza During the year one male death from influenza was recorded. The previous year 13 deaths were registered. Prevention of Blindness This comes under the control of the Surrey County Council. Ophthalmia Neonatorum During the year four cases of ophthalmia neonatorum were notified. Poliomyelitis There were four cases affecting one adult, one youth, and two young children. The adult case was very doubtful, while the others had some degree of paralysis, two very slight and one moderate. The three paralytic cases had an illness resembling a cold about one week before the paralysis, which is a typical history. Before paralysis occurred in one case there was an inflamed throat with glands in the neck enlarged, a similar picture being present in two cases seen by general practitioners. In those cases which are seen before paralysis it is unusual to report enlarged cervical glands. School Notifications The school intimation notices of infectious disease are always compared with the notifications received from the medical practitioners. If any case on the school return is found to be 44 unnotified, investigations are made in order to find out if the patient is receiving medical attention. The school notices also give information of the prevalence of non-notifiable infectious disease, such as chicken pox, mumps, etc. The numbers were as follows:— Chicken pox 252 Mumps 66 Ringworm 1 Rubella 234 Scabies 1 Cancer The number of deaths from cancer registered during the year was 128, of which 73 were males and 55 were females. The incidence of deaths from cancer has been steadily growing and the rate of 1.91 per 1,000 population is the highest recorded, although this was equalled in 1945. The rate for Mitcham is usually below that for England and Wales, the figure for the past year not being available yet. The site distribution for 1952 was as follows: — Digestive organs 12 cases Respiratory organs 31 ,, Breast 14 ,, Genito-urinary organs 5 ,, Other sites 66 ,, Total 128 ,, The following table shows the number of deaths from cancer, together with the death rate as compared with England and Wales:— Year Number of Deaths Death Rate per l ,000 of population Mitcham England and Wales 1933 52 .86 1.52 1934 70 1.1 1.56 1935 61 1.0 1.58 45 Year Number of Deaths Death Rate per 1,000 of population Mitcham England and Wales 1936 80 1.2 1.61 1937 76 1.1 1.63 1938 103 1.5 1.66 1939 73 1.12 1.64 1940 94 1.55 1.66 1941 84 1.6 1.67 1942 104 1.90 1.698 1943 95 1.7 1.74 1944 83 1.6 1.7 1945 103 1.91 1.74 1946 108 1.74 1.76 1947 103 1.60 1.86 1948 111 1.67 1.85 1949 124 1.85 1.87 1950 102 1.51 1.89 1951 108 1.61 1.90 1952 128 1.91 – Tuberculosis During the year 116 new cases of tuberculosis were notified viz: — Males Females Total Pulmonary 59 51 110 Non-Pulmonary 4 2 6 Totals 63 53 116 Thirty-nine cases were transferred into the Borough as follows:— Males Females Total Pulmonary 18 21 39 Non-Pulmonary — — — Totals 18 21 39 46 The total number of deaths from tuberculosis was:— Males Females Total Pulmonary 7 4 11 Non-Pulmonary 2 — 2 Totals 9 4 13 England and Wales Mitcham Death rate from tuberculosis, all forms, per 1,000 population 0.24 0.19 The following table shows the number of new cases, the type of disease and the deaths from tuberculosis during the year.
