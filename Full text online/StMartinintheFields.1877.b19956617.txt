Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields,for the Tear 1877. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you ray Eighth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This year was marked by the continuation of the Smallpox epidemic, which commenced in the latter part of 1876. In this parish there were several cases of this disease, many of which were sent to the Metropolitan Asylum Smallpox Hospitals, others passed throngh the disorder at their own homes, and not one of the latter died, whereas several of the former proved fatal. The same precautions against the spread of this malady, as recorded in my report for the year 1876, B 18 . were again taken with happy results. I must once more urge the importance of Vaccination and Revaccination in guarding against an attack of this disease; if the public would avail themselves of this safeguard we should not be periodically visited with Smallpox epidemics. Births. The Births registered in the year 1877 were 491, that is 3 less than in the preceding year. The following Table gives the number of Births occurring; in each month:— Males. Females. Total. January 26 21 47 February 24 18 42 March 30 17 47 April 21 26 47 May 25 29 54 June 15 17 32 July 15 14 29 August 26 23 49 September 16 18 34 October 20 24 44 November 17 12 29 December 19 18 37 254 237 491 19 Deaths. The Deaths registered in the year 1877 amounted to 466, being 28 less than in the previous year. The following Table gives the number of Deaths ??? ccurring in each month:— Males. Females. Total. January 24 11 35 February 17 11 28 March 38 20 58 April 27 22 49 May 28 29 57 June 23 16 39 July 24 10 34 August 25 14 39 September 21 8 29 October 22 16 38 November 14 14 28 December 20 12 32 283 183 466 Of the above 466 deaths, 153 oceurred in the Charing Cross Hospital; of this latter number, 109 were nonresidents in St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This circumstance will therefore give the true death-rate of the Parish. B 20 Deaths, 1877 466 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 109 357 Death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1877, 16.9 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 59.3 By the above figures the death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1877 was 16.9. This is a remarkably low deathrate, thus showing the healthy condition of our Parish. The death-rate per 1,000 for the whole of London in the year 1877 was 21.9. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the last seven years:— 1871 19.4 1872 18.7 1873 20.2 1874 18.6 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 Ages at Death. Of the 466 deaths, 133 occurred in children under 5 years of age, 33 between 5 and 20 years, 85 between 20 and 40 years, 129 between 40 and 60 years, 75 between 60 and 80 years, and 11 above 80 vcars. 21 Causes of Death.

Mrs. Wood's Legacy and Lord Henry Seymour's bequest, 3 per Cent. Consols 9,501 10 6 Sinking Fund, New 3 per Cents 2,675 14 6 £12,177 11 0 Memorandum.—The full establishment in the Alms Houses consists of Seventy Widows and Unmarried Women, who have been Housekeepers in the Parish; they receive 34s. 6d., 36s., and 42s. 6d.per Calendar Month, according to the several Foundations to which they have been elected. Those labouring under sickness, or other infirmities, are provided with Nurses at the charge of the Funds. A Chaplain attends at Chapel on Sunday and Thursday in each week, to perform Divine Service; they are also attended by an eminent Medical Gentleman, and are furnished with Medicine free of charge.—The Out-Pensioners consist of Married Couples, who receive 30s. per Calendar Month; and Single Persons receive 20s. per Calendar Month each; they have been also Housekeepers in the Parish. The Vestry having found that several applicants for the Alms Fund preferred receiving the Out-Pension and living with their friends, instead of residing in the Alms Houses, have during the last few years, elected the most deserving applicants as Out-Pensioners, by which means the Alms' Fund has been distributed between a larger number of Out-Pensioners than formerly. The number of Pensioners on the Fund in March, 1877, were as follows:—42 Almswomen, 18 Married Couples, and 46 Single Persons—Out-Pensioners. Deed of Gift of Sir Charles Cotterell and Mrs. Susan Grahme. Sir Charles Cotterell, in 1686, gave for 8 Alms Women in the Alms Houses on his Foundation £ s. d. 20 0 0 per annum arising from the Manor of Drayton and Westover, in the County of Somerset. and Mrs. Susan Grahme, in 1686, for 4 Alms Women in the Alms Houses on her Foundation 50 0 per annum arising from the same Manor. These sums are paid to those twelve Alms Women monthly, by the Vicar, or his Deputy for the time being, and who form a part of the 70 Alms Women in the Alms Houses. This fund is independent of the monthly pay they each receive from the Parish Foundation. 8 19 7 The residue of the Rent-charge purchased by the Vestry with £179 Parish Stock. £78 19 7 - Smith's Charity. Henry Smith, Esq., bequeathed by will, in 1626, to 24 parishes the Rents, &c., of his Manor, and the amount of their respective shares vary from £12 to £30 per annum, according to the declarations of the Will. The proportion of the Rent received by this Parish varies from £20 to £24 per annum; arises from the Manor and Rectory of Longney, in the county of Gloucester; Trustees, the Governors of Christ's Hospital, to whom an annual return is made of the distribution. The proceeds are distributed by the last senior Churchwarden, in Clothing, Provisions, or Moneys to poor persons of good character, who have been or are residents, or who have lived in the Parish at least five years, either as Housekeepers or Lodgers.
