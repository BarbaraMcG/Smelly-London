REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For 1879. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwell, during the year 1879, was 1456. The annual average of the last ten years was 1416, so that the deaths were 40 more than the average. The deaths in 1878 having been 1303, those in 1879 were 153 more than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— deaths. births. 1870 1,473 2,415 1871 1,417 2,274 1872 1,323 2,353 1873 1,513 2,664 1874 1,417 2,565 1875 1,539 2,505 1876 1,342 2,559 1877 1,385 2,522 1878 1,303 2,590 1879 1,456 2,667 The births were thus 77 more than in the preceding year, and 156 more than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 463 804 341 Amwell 374 698 324 Pentonville 298 511 213 Goswell 321 654 333 16 In each year a number of tho deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The estimated number of these for 1879 is 100. The number of births having been 2,667, and of deaths 1,456, the excess or the natural increase of population, is 1,211. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1879, was 227; being 8 less than in the preceding year. The numbers and causes of the deaths taking place from these principal zymotic diseases during the last ten years, are exhibited in the subjoined table:— SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. HOOPING COUGH. TYPHLS. DIARRHOEA. TOTALS. 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 1871 60 23 33 62 68 33 279 1872 15 35 20 105 76 23 274 1873 0 48 13 49 29 95 234 1874 2 63 71 38 31 55 260 1875 2 36 76 82 24 58 278 1876 2 48 34 41 12 73 210 1877 15 73 82 36 25 53 284 1878 1 39 41 56 25 73 235 1879 1 74 44 61 11 36 227 17 The average number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years, was 260; so that the number for 1879 is 43 below the average. The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age was 412; 18 more than in the preceding year. 251 deaths occurred at and above 60; being 54 more than in the preceding year. 128 inquest-deaths were registered in the year; being 9 more than in the preceding year. 96 deaths occurred in the "Workhouse; 56 of males, 40 of females. The numbers in the preceding year were 59, 31, and 28 respectively. 17 deaths took place in the House of Correction; 9 in the House of Detention. 43 deaths arose from violence; the number for 1878 being 40. Hence the mortality of the year has been above the average. The mortality amounted to 22 per 1,000; if the persons dying in Hospitals, &c., be added, the mortality would amount to 23 per 1,000. In 20 large English towns, the mortality per 1,000 in 1879 was:—London, 23.3; Brighton, 19; Portsmouth, 16.7; Norwich, 22; Plymouth, 22.4; Bristol, 21.1; Wolverhampton, 22.7; Birmingham, 22.2; Leicester, 21.6; Nottingham, 22.6; Liverpool, 27.1; Manchester, 26.9; Salford, 24.9; Oldham, 21.7; Bradford, 21.2; Leeds, 22.6; Sheffield, 21.3; Hull, 22.3; Sunderland, 21.9; Newcastle-on-Tyne, 23.6. The mortality in all London was 23.3; that of the West districts, 21.1; of the North districts, 22; of the Central districts, 26; of the East districts, 25.7 ; and of the South districts, 23.3. The most notable point in regard to the mortality is, that it has been above the average. But when it is considered that the total number of deaths from zymotic diseases has been less than 18 the average; and that the number of deaths from Hooping Cough and Measles have been more than this, with the increae in the number of deaths at and above 60; the fact shown by the Meteorological table, that the year was__an unusually cold and wet one, will account for this. Small Pox prevailed to a slight extent during the year; 16 cases are known to have occurred in the parish: 7 in January; 2 in March; 1 in May; 4 in June; 1 in July; and 1 in October. 5 of the deaths included under Scarlet Fever, were returned as arising from Diphtheria. Of the 11 deaths placed under Typhus, none arose from Typhus proper; 9 from Typhoid Fever; and 2 from continued Fever. Slaughter-houses.—The Slaughter-houses were inspected in October and November. They were 19; 9 in the upper Wards, and 10 in the lower. They were mostly in good order; in a few, the paving and lime-whiting were defective. No complaints were made of them during the year. Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 23: 14 in the upper "Wards, and 9 in the lower Wards. The number of cows kept was 273; these were mostly in very fine condition. Bake-houses.—These were also inspected during the year, in August. They were 62; in fair order, but the lime-whiting showed that the omission of their inspection during the preceding year had had its effects. Mortuary.—This still continues its usefulness to the parish. 319 bodies were removed to it during the year; 94 of these came from the Workhonse; 96 were brought there for inquest purposes; and 129 were sent by the parishioners. 55 postmortems were made in the year. 19 The Meteorology of the year was as follows: — 1879. Temperature, Average. Difference, from average of 38 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation = 100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 64 years. Year 46.2 —3.3 41.2 83 29.77 31 3 + 6.0 "Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., March) 37.1 —2.8 32.3 82 29.67 7.0 + 2.0 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 49.5 — 3.6 43.1 79 29.66 10.3 + 4.5 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 58.1 —2.2 53.3 84 29.70 11.7 + 4.4 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 39.9 —4.6 36.3 87 30.04 2.3 —4.9 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year, as well as that of each quarter, was below the average. The amount of rain was considerably above the average; even more than that of the preceding year, which was also above the average. I have the honoxir to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, June 16th, 1880. J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D, VESTRY OF THE parish of St. Hames and ST. John, CLERKENWELL. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875.

I do hereby certify that in this Account of the Guardians and Governors of the poor of the Parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, I have disallowed the sum of Eighteen pounds three shillings and two pence, and I do hereby surcharge the sum of Eighteen pounds ridge, and William James Harrison, three of the Guardians or Governors of the said Parish. And I do hereby furtner certify that the sum of Eighteen pounds three shillings and two pence, is due from the said Edward Culver, Joseph Aldridge, and William James Harrison. As witness my hand, this 6th day of August, 1880, H. LLOYD ROBERTS, Auditor of the Metropolitan Audit District, which comprises the above named Parish. p.t.o. In the account for the half-year ended at Lady-day, 1880, of the Guardians or Governors of the Poor of the Parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, I disallowed the sum of £18 3s. 2d, being a portion of certian Bills of costs amounting to the sum of £690 6s. 5d., paid to Mr. Sampson, a Solicitor, with respect to certain proceedings taken against divers persons for keeping disorderly houses. I made such disallowances for the following reasons:— (1). As to £5 13s. 4d, a portion of the said sum of £18 3s. 2d., because the same was in respect of charge for attendances, &c. &c., upon the Special Committee of the Vestry of Clerkenwell, which attendances were unnecessary and improper, and any charges for such attendances were not properly payable out of the Poor Rates of the said Parish. (2). As to £12 9s. 10d. the remaining portion of the said sum of £18 3s. 2d., because the said charges were improper and were not legally chargeable upon the Poor Rates as the requirements of the Statutes, 25 Geo. II, Cap. 36 & 58, Geo. III. Cap. 70, in that case made and provided had not been complied with, more particularly as two inhabitants of the said Parish had not given notice in writing of any person keeping a bawdy house, and such inhabitants had not made oath before a Justice of the Peace that the contents of such notice were true, and had not entered into a recognizance to give or produce material evidence against such persons for such offence, and neither a constable nor overseer had entered into a recognizance to prosecute with effect such persons for such offence as well as other provisions of the statutes, and such bills amounting to the sum of £12 9s. 10d. were not for charges in respect of matters contemplated by such statutes, but were in respect of charges for watching certain suspected houses in respect of which no inhabitant had made complaint in manner provided by law. Dated this 7th day of September, 1880. II. LLOYD ROBERTS, District Auditor. And I surcharged the said sum of £18 3s. 2d. upon Edwaid Culver, Joseph Aldridge and William James Harrison, three of the said Guardians or Governors because they authorized the making of the illegal payment. Dated this 7th day of September, 1880. H. LLOYD ROBERTS, District Auditor.
