HAN 3 Parish of Saint George, HANOVER SQUARE. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the YEAR ENDED 28th DECEMBER, 1895. bonbon: Wightman & Co., "The Westminster Press, 104 & 106, Regency Street, S.W. HAN 3 REPORT on THE SANITARY CONDITION of the Parish of St. George, hanover Square, FOR THE YEAR 1895, W. H. CORFIELD, M,A., M.D. (Oxon), F.R C.P. (LOND.), Professor of Hygiene and Public Health in University College, London; Past President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; Honorary Member of the Society of Hygiene of France, and of the Hungarian Society of Public Health; Honorary Corresponding Member of ths Royal Society of Public Health of Belgium, of the Imperial Society of Medicine of Constantinople, and of the Royal Society of Hygiene of Italy; Fellow of the Medical Society of Sweden; MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (BEING HIS TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT). To the vestry of the Parish Saint George, hanover square. My Lords and Gentlemen, The total number of deaths registered in the Parish during the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1895, was 1,675, against an average of 1,772 during the preceding ten years. Of these deaths 603 were those of NonParishioners (Table II.), leaving 1,072 deaths of Parishioners. To these, however, must be added 113 deaths of our Parishioners in Public Institutions in the Metropolis outside of the Parish and in the extra Metropolitan Asylums, so that the corrected total of deaths of our Parishioners was 1,185, or 128 less than the average during the preceding ten years. (See Table I.) In my Annual Report for 1892 I explained the manner in which I estimated the population for the middle of that year; applying the same method, I calculate that the population of the Parish at the middle of 1895 was as follows:— Mayfair 22,904 Belgravia 56,464 Whole Parish 79,368 It must, however, be borne in mind that this estimate is based upon the Census population of 1891, which I believe to be, for reasons given in previous Annual Reports, considerably too low, in fact, some thousands below the real population. 2 The calculated death-rates are therefore no doubt all too high ; they are as follows:— Mayfair 10.53 Belgravia 15.16 Whole Parish 14.98 per 1,000 per annum. It will be seen from Table I. that the death-rate of the Parish during 1895 was nevertheless lower than that of any year except 1894, being more than 1 per thousand lower than the average of the preceding ten years. The fact that the death-rate was higher in 1895 than in 1894 is to be chiefly attributed to the intense cold that prevailed during the early part of 1895. Table I. YEAR. Gross Total of Deaths.

From Table III. we see that the death-rate of London proper amounted to 19.8, the average rate in the previous ten years having been 201. The death-rate of Greater London, with an estimated population of 6,048,555, was 18 4, the average rate in the previous ten years having been 18.8. 4 The death-rate of the 33 largest English towns was 207. The death-rate of this parish was lower than that of any one of the 33 largest English towns except Croydon, the nearest to it being Croydon 14.5 Derby 6.7 Huddersfield 16.9 Leicester 17.2 Portsmouth 17.8 West Ham 17.9 and the highest being:— Bolton 24.0 Blackburn 24.3 Wolverhampton 244 Manchester 25.2 Salford 25.6 Liverpool. 28.8 The death-rate of Edinburgh was 20.7, or the same as that of the 33 great towns; that of Glasgow 23.5, and that of Dublin 27.9. All these rates are considerably higher than in 1894, when no great English Town had so high a rate as 24. Two Colonial cities had lower death-rates than this parish, the lowest death-rates among Colonial and Foreign cities being those of:— Sydney 13.1 Brisbane 13.7 St. Louis 16.8 Christiania 16.9 Stockholm l7.0 Amsterdam 17.4 Cincinnati 18.1 Copenhagen 18.5 The Hague 18.8 5 and the highest being:— "Trieste 30.2 Bombay 304 Alexandria 33.9 Calcutta 35.5 Moscow 35.6 Madras 37.7 Cairo 48.1 In Berlin the rate was 19.4, in Paris 21.3, and in Vienna 23.l; all higher than in 1894.

The birth-rate for London proper was 30.5, as against 301 in 1894. The average birth-rate of the 33 largest English towns was 3l.3, as against 30.7 in 1894, the highest being those of Liverpool 36.9, Salford 35.9, and Wolverhampton 35.4; and the lowest those of Brighton 25.6, Croydon 25.3, Halifax 23.4, and Huddersfield 21.7. The number of deaths of children under one year of age (Parishioners; see Table A at end of Report) was 204; 6 the percentage of such deaths to registered births was 13.88, and to total deaths of parishioners, 17.22; thus the mortality of children under one year of age was only 139 to a thousand births, while in London generally it was 166, and the average for the 33 largest English towns was 182, the highest being Salford 231, Blackburn 236, Burnley 242, and Preston 248, deaths of children under one year of age to a thousand births.

There were, however (see Table VI.) only 333 deaths of parishioners of 65 years and upwards, giving a percentage of 28.10 of the corrected total of deaths. From Table V. we also see that 87 deaths from injuries were registered in the Parish, being 5.19 per cent. of the total deaths, but of the 87 deaths registered under this heading only 39 were those of parishioners, and 7 parishioners died from injuries outside of the Parish, making a total of 46 deaths of parishioners from "Injuries" (see 7 Table VI.), and giving a percentage of 3.88 of the corrected total of deaths, or a little lower than that of London generally, 3.92. The Inquest cases held in the parish numbered 147. They were equivalent to 8.8 per cent. of the gross total of deaths, as against 8.6 in London generally. Table VI.

It must, however, be remembered that these rates are calculated on too small a population. From the birth and death rates in Table VIII. I have calculated, as usual, "the mean length of life." I use the term "mean length of life" instead of "mean duration of life" (as I explained in my Annual Report for 1890), in order to prevent confusion, as the term "mean duration of life" is a technical expression which means the length of life as calculated by the life-table method. The "mean length of life" stated in this report is calculated by means of Dr. Bristowe's formula. Mean Length of Life. Mayfair Sub-District 93.59 Belgravia 52.39 Whole Parish 59.96 Table IX.

Table X. shows that the total number of Parishioners dying from the principal infectious diseases and from diarrhoea, including 20 dying in Public Institutions outside of the Parish, was 109, which is equivalent to a zymotic death-rate of only 1.38, as against 1.23 in 1894, the rate for 11 London being 2 64, and that for the 33 largest English towns 2.84. The only large towns showing a lower zymotic deathrate than this Parish are Huddersfield 1.20, Halifax and Bristol 1.30, and Croydon 1.32. The highest zymotic death-rates in the country are furnished by Liverpool 4.01, Wolverhampton 4.23, Bolton 4.45, Salford 4.96, and Blackburn 5.63. Table X.

Measles caused 10 deaths of Parishioners, or only a little over one-third of the annual average. Scarlet Fever caused only 8 deaths of Parishioners, being 12 3 below the annual average. It also caused 2 deaths of Non-Parishioners in the Parish. Diphtheria: 23 deaths were caused by this very fatal disease, as against 18 in 1894, and an annual average of 20 during the preceding 5 years. (There was also 1 death of a Parishioner from Membranous Croup.) Diphtheria also caused 11 deaths of Non-Parishioners in the Parish. This disease is still exceedingly prevalent in London and in some of the other great towns, the average death-rate from it in the 33 largest English towns in 1895 being 40 per cent, above the average of the preceding 10 years. Whooping Cough: 25 deaths of Parishioners were registered, the annual average of theprevious 5 years having been 24. This disease also caused 3 deaths of NonParishioners in the Parish. Typhus Fever was not, so far as I am aware, present in the Parish during the year, and no death from it has been recorded in the Parish since 1884. Enteric (Typhoid) Fever: Eight deaths of Parishioners were recorded, the same number as in 1894, and also the same as the annual average. Six Non-Parishioners died of this disease in the Parish. Simple continued Fever: one death from this disease was registered. Diurrhaea: this disease caused 33 deaths of Parishioners as against only 10 in 1894, and an annual average of 24. It also caused 5 deaths of IN on-Parishioners in the Parish. 1 may note that the mean temperature of the spring, summer, and autumn quarters of the year was above the average of the last 124 years, and that the temperature of 13 the spring and summer quarters was nearly 3 degrees above that average. The mean temperature of the year was 49'3 degrees, or 0 7 above the average of 124 years. No death from English Cholera was registered Influenza: 67 deaths of Parishioners were recorded from this disease, a greater number than have been recorded since 1892. Four Non-Parishioners also died from it in the Parish. As there is no special column for this disease in the table (A), ordered by the Local Government Board to be used, the deaths from it are entered under other headings according to the information given in the certificates. Casks of Infectious Diseases. The following table shows the number of cases certified by Medical Attendants in 1890, 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, and 1895:— Table XI. Name of Disease.

Three other cases were also certified by the Medical Attendants as Small-pox; but, on examining two of them, 14 I found them to be cases of Chicken-pox, and the third, which had been sent to the Small-pox Hospital before I saw it, was returned as a case of Chicken-pox. Of the 37 cases of Enteric Fever, 10 were certified in November and December, and 11 in the three previous months, so that the monthly average for the two last months of the year (5) was not so much higher than that of the three previous months (3.7) as it was in the years 1891-94. cases of Enteric Fever.

The possible cause of this was suggested in my last year's Report, as it follows upon the delivery of insufficiently filtered Thames water when the river is in flood. Sanitary Work For the Year ending Deceiiiber 28th, 1895. The following tables, prepared by Mr. Albert Taylor, your Chief Sanitary Inspector, show the amount of sanitary work done. I have added the figures for 1894 for comparison. 15 Table XII. 1894. 1895.

There are 73 houses let in lodgings. They have been inspected, and the regulations as to cleansing complied with. The total number of applications for the removal of house refuse were:—In the In-Wards, 1,695; in Grosvenor Place District, 1,522; and in South Belgravia District, 2,628. With regard to the Factory and Workshop Acts, Mr. Taylor reports that:— "A house-to-house inspection has been made of all the premises in New Bond, South Molton, and Davies streets, which come within the operation of these Acts, while a number of inspections have been made in various parts of the district as the result of special complaints." "The number of workshops and work-places inspected was 120; of these, the sanitary arrangements of 100 were found defective, the drains of 25 having to be reconstructed." "These 120 premises contained 165 work-rooms, 38 of which were overcrowded, and 12 in a dirty and unwholesome condition. There were 1,184 persons found employed in these workrooms, or 131 in excess of the accommodation, taking 250 cubic feet as the minimum amount of cubic space allowed for each person for such places." In all cases where it seemed to be necessary, measures have been taken to diminish the number of persons in workshops so as to prevent overcrowding, and to enforce the provisions as to cleanliness, ventilation, and drainage. 17 There are 47 bake-houses on the register; these have been inspected thoroughly during the year, and the sanitary condition of some of them has been improved, notices having been issued, and the necessary improvements carried out by the owners. During the year 9 bake-houses on the register at the beginning of 1895 have been struck off because they were not in use on the 1st of January, 1896, and one has been demolished. The Factory and Workshops Act of 1895 contains important sanitary provisions, especially with regard to the amount of space to be allowed for each person employed; the Act also applies to Laundries and to Bakehouses, and prohibits the use of any "place underground "as a Bakehouse," unless it is so used at the commencement of this Act." Your Committee has had cards prepared to show the number of persons who may be employed in each factory or workshop, and in each room, and these are being filled up and distributed to be hung up in conspicuous places in the factories and workshops, and in each room where work is carried on. There are now no cowsheds in the Parish. The licensed slaughterhouses, of which there are now only two in the Parish, have been regularly inspected and found to be satisfactorily conducted. The same may be said of the street stalls and butchers shops, to which frequent visits are paid, but it has not been necessary to seize any article of food as unfit for human consumption. The Mewses in the Parish are frequently inspected, and are generally satisfactory, except during the height of the 18 season, when there is great difficulty in getting rid of the dung, because the farmers are too busy to fetch it away. There are now only about a dozen known sunken dung pits in the whole Parish, as the rest have been abolished, and metal cages substituted, 332 having been provided during the past year. Table XIV.

Similar notices were sent to the Chief Librarian of the Public Libraries belonging to the Vestry to prevent the issue of books to infected houses. The Public Shelter, provided by the Vestry for housing families temporarily displaced during the disinfection of their homes, and bedding, has been occupied once during the year. *Including Diarrhoea in August and September. 19 Disinfectants have been distributed to the public when required, and personal instructions given as to their proper use. The preparations made by me in 1892, in case of an invasion of cholera, were described in my annual report for that year; the arrangments made still hold good and could be set to work at any time. The following Table shows the number of bodies received in the Mortuary during the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1895, as compiled from the returns furnished to me monthly by the Mortuary Keeper, Mr. Birch.

The Isolation Hospitals are the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and occasionally the London Fever Hospital and the London Small Pox Hospital, 24 For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases (including Diphtheria) is kept at the Workhouse in Wallis's Yard, Buckingham Palace Road, and that the ambulance belonging to the Metropolitan Asylums Board is kept at Seagrove Road, Fulham; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply at the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington (or, in case of Small-pox, at the Highgate Small-pox Hospital), where they can be accommodated on favourable terms. Also that a refuge has been provided at No. i, Pimlico Road, for the use of persons during the disinfection of their rooms. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W.
