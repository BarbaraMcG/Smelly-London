Health Visitor: Miss J. Cruickshank. Junior Clerk: W. Tillcock, CHISWICK URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chiswick, W. To the Chairman and Members of the Chiswick District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report for 1908. The health of the district has been exceptionally good as shown by the low death rate viz., 12.17 Per thousand of the population, which I may say is one of the lowest on record. The zymotic death rate was also low, being 1.01 per thousand. On referring to the Report it will be seen that the Sanitary Department has been actively employed ; every year adds to the duties that are entrusted to Sanitary Authorities. It is necessary to repeat each year many of the details of this Report and it is perhaps inevitable that the statistics and some parts of the letter press should be dry and uninteresting to the ordinary reader. 6 The Health Department is only one of several under the control of the Council generally, but the work is more especially regulated by definite rules framed by the Local Government Board. The amount of work carried out by the staff of this department cannot be entirely set out by figures and statistics, much of it consisting of advice given verbally and suggestions made more or less unofficially. The Inspectors who personally carry out the duties, are brought closely in touch with the inhabitants of the district, and the success of their work depends to a large extent on friendly relations and tact. A Sanitary Inspector who has once gained the confidence of the people with whom he is brought into contact, is in a far better position to deal with small details, affecting the public health in a more effectual way, than a stranger newly appointed. Fortunately no changes in the permanent staff have to be recorded. During the year the new Birth Act has been adopted by your Council subject to the consent of the Local Government Board. The result of the adoption of this Act has been the appointment of a Health Visitor, who commenced her duties in the early part of June, and I may add that her work in the parish has been so far a success. I append her Report:— "Sir, "I beg to report that during my first seven " monts ending December 31st, 1908, as Health "Visitor for Chiswick, 505 births have been " registered, 343 homes haves been visited, and 7 "the total number of visits during that period "were 960. Of the number of infants visited " 22 have died, 9 were artificially fed. No history "of Consumption in either case." "Of the two dozen feeding bottles given "into my charge, seventeen have now been distributed and have been much appreciated." "Yours obediently, "Janet Cruickshank, "Health Visitor." There is a considerable reduction in the Infantile Mortality during the year, it being equal to 106.9 per thousand births, compared with the year 1907 when it was 119.1. Vital Statistics. The population being estimated at the middle of the year, calculating that the usual rate of increase has been maintained, and may be fairly estimated at 36,377, and on these figures both the birth and death rates are calculated. Births. The number registered during the year amounted to 898; of this number 486 were males and 412 females, including 19 illegitimate. The birth rate was 24.68 compared with 25.43 per thousand for 1907. For London it was 25.4, and for the 76 great towns 27.0. 6 Deaths. The total number was 443 (230 males, 213 females whilst for 1907 they amounted to 339. The number of deaths registered outside the district was 108; there were in addition 16 deaths of non-residents registered. The deathrate calculated on the total number of deaths of parishioners, viz., 351, with the addition of 108 who died beyond the district, and deducting t6 non-residants who were registered in the district, makes a total of 443. The death rate was 12.17 Per thousand. For London it was 13.8, and for the 76 principal towns 15.8. Infantile Deathrate. The number of children who died under a year was 96, compared with 109 for 1907, and was equal to 106.9 Per thousand births, compared with 119.1 for 1907, and 115.2 for 1906. For London it was 113 and for the 76 principal towns 128. It becomes a question as to how far this reduction may be due, to the work and energy of your Health Visitor, whose services have been well appreciated by the class of people amongst whom she works, and by whom she is well received and appreciated. As regards the "Notification of Births' Act," it is clear that greater use might have been made of it, had there been more consideration shown in framing it for the difficulties in which the medical practitioner must occasionally find himself in the matter of 9 professional secrecy. We shall, however, look forward to see some amendments in the near future. Infantile mortality is largely a matter of the personality of the parents, for even in the same street there may be found families living practically under the same conditions, except so far as the habits of the parents are concerned. The whole question resolves itself to a great extent into one of education, and on this view it may of course be inferred, that infantile mortality exerts its greatest influence upon the children of the indolent, the drunkard, and the diseased. As education and improved social conditions advance, we may expect to see a diminution of infantile mortality. "The Education Act," 1907, came into force in the early part of the year it has been termed the "children's charter," and having regard to the enormous potentialities of the measure, the title is not altogether inappropriate. "The Children Act." The chief provision of this important proposal may be regarded as more social, than medical. We may, however, welcome many of its provisions as distinctly promoting the health of children, and also having a bearing on infantile mortality. This is more particularly the case with reference to Part I of this Act, which deals in effect with baby farming and infantile insurance. Part III of this Act refers to the injurious 10 effect of juvenile smoking, concerning which there is a general opinion amongst all classes that the habit is if not injurious, (?) or dangerous, (?) at least very unnecessary. Senility or Old Age. One hundred and forty-four persons reached the age of 65. and upwards, including 60 septuagenarians and 24 octogenarians. Four attained the age of 90 and upwards. Infectious or Zymotic Diseases. Diseases of this class were responsible for 37 deaths. For the year 1907 they amounted to 59, and for the year 1906 the total was 55. Smallpox 0 Measles 1 Scarlet Fever 0 Diphtheria 2 Whooping Cough 11 Enteric (or Typhoid) 2 Diarrhœa 10 Enteritis 8 Croup 0 Erysipelas 2 Puerperal Fever 1 The zymotic death rate was 1.01 per thousand compared with 1.64 for 1907 and 1.62 for 1906. That for London was 1.35 and for the 76 great towns. 11 Infectious Diseases Notification Act. Under the above Act the following notifications have been received: — Smallpox 0 Scarlet Fever 89 Diphtheria 32 Erysipelas 38 Enteric Fever 5 Phthisis 1 Total 165 For 1907 they amounted to 298, for 1906 there were 206, and for 1905 they numbered 238. Scarlet Fever Was more or less prevalent during each month of the year, although the cases were far less numerous than those for 1907 and occurred in most parts of the district. Many were of a severe type, although there were no deaths. The fatality from this complaint is considered to be greatest during the first year of life and declines rapidly up to the age period 10-15, after which age, an attack of Scarlet Fever is usually attended with increased risk. The disease has a short incubation period of less than a week, most frequently of two or four days, and is marked by a sudden sharp onset with head-ache, 12 vomitting, shortly followed by sore throat and a characteristic eruption which generally disappears within a week and is followed by desquamation. The lymphatic glands at the angle of the jaw quickly become enlarged; the tongue presents the strawberry appearance. There are, however, very many anomalous cases. Sometimes the onset is not well marked, occasionally no eruption or simply a passing one is present, and the illness is of an exceedingly brief duration. For these reasons attacks are too frequently overlooked and there is occasionally great difficulty in distinguishing Scarlet Fever from Diphtheria or from some acute affection of the tonsils. Cases of Scarlet Fever are by far most infectious at the commencement of the illness. Diphtheria. Thirty-two cases were notified, followed by two deaths, against 30 notifications and 3 deaths for 1907. An outbreak of this complaint took place in a small cottage at the East end of the district. I had to remove four cases in one family to the Hospital where they made a satisfactory recovery. These children had been drinking water from an uncovered cistern which was in a very dirty condition. I suggested that the water should be drawn direct from the main by a draw-off tap which was done with a satisfactory result. It is an acknowledged fact that school life not only causes an increase of Diphtheria, but occasions a not 13 siderable number of attacks in younger children. Crowding in schools has no doubt an important influence. The use of common basins and towels, also exchange of handkerchiefs, are all likely to favour the spread of the complaint. Enteric or Typhoid Fever. There were 5 notifications and 2 deaths. The parish has been exceptionally free from this disease during the year. One death was probably due to the fact of the patient having partaken of shell fish. Enteritis. Twelve notifications, followed by 8 deaths, 7 occurred in children under a year. Diarrhoea. The mortality from this complaint was the lowest on record, (10), with the exception of the year 1903, when the deaths numbered 9. It was prevalent as usual during the Summer and Autumn, and confined almost entirely to young children. Whooping Cough Was prevalent during the months of April, May and June, resulting in II deaths, compared with 9 for 1907. It is a more distressing malady than Measles and 14 possibly in the chest weakness which follows, a more disastrous one. The greatest mortality from this disease is experienced in the latter part of the first year of age. Measles There were a few cases of this complaint during the months of May and June, followed by one death; otherwise the district has been comparatively free. The great majority of the deaths from Measles occur within the first three weeks after the commencement of illness, and these are mainly due to the intensity of the infection. The most serious element in Measles is probably not exactly the number of deaths which occur during the illness, but the susceptibility induced to attacks of tuberculosis. Influenza Was somewhat prevalent during the Spring and late Autumn. There were 10 deaths, due chiefly to pulmonary and heart complications. Cancer Was the immediate cause of 39 deaths; for 1907 they numbered 42. Of the former 19 were males and 20 females. The disease is mostly met with, after the age of 60 and upwards. The following table gives the locality, sex, and age. DEATHS from CANCER (Distributed according to Locality, Age and Sex). Wards.

The Local Government Board issued an order at the end of the year rendering compulsory the notification of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis by the Poor Law Medical Officer, in the case of any poor person he is attending, according to agreement with the Board of Guardians. The notifications are to be made to the Medical Officer of Health within 48 hours after the symptoms of the disease are first recognised, and entered in a Register kept for the purpose. The subjoined table gives the distribution as to locality, age, and sex. A case occurred in the West London Hospital which proved fatal. The necessary precautions and restrictions were put on the nurse as to her future engagements. 29 were held during the year with the following verdicts: — Puerperal Fever. Inquests. Natural Causes 17 Accidents 5 Suicide 6 Murder 1 16 Cremation. The increase in the frequency of cremation in London is partly attributable to the advantages which are realised by the public, and also by the great reduction in the contingent expenses. Dairies and Milkshops. The total number registered is 35. The usual inspections have been made and notices served with the view of amending any sanitary defects which have been found. There are 15 dairies which may be considered as being quite up-to-date and supplied with all modern requirements as regards both utensils and machinery. With reference to the general shops, (20), where small quantities of milk are retailed to the poorer classes, and require a certain amount of extra supervision owing to the fact of the milk being in close proximity to soap, candles, paraffin, and other articles, I always impress on those who retail the milk, the importance of keeping it covered. Whilst on the subject of milk I would suggest that all milk (especially for children) should be either pasteurized or heated almost to the boiling point, but not allowed to boil, with the view of destroying any germs of disease. Cowsheds. There are two registered in the district. Both are well kept and the cleanliness of the cows well maintained, and partial grooming is now becoming a routine procedure in most cowsheds. 17 Bakehouses. There are 16 registered in the district. Of this number 4 are underground. In the course of my visits of inspection I was pleased with the improvement in the general sanitary condition of most of them. New Buildings. The total number of dwelling houses completed during the year was 143, in addition to which there were two blocks of flats containing 16 tenements; also 16 shops and the "Bell and Crown" Public House, Thames Road, Strand-on-the-Green. Isolation Hospital. Situated at Clayponds Road, Brentford, stands in three acres of land and was opened for the reception of patients in April, 1904. It contains a Municipal Block with rooms for the Matron, Medical Officer, Nurses, Servants, and kitchen offices. The wards consist of two for Scarlet Fever, with two for private patients, and a separate block containing two small wards—one for Diphtheria, the other for Enteric or Typhoid. The following are the admissions during 1908:— Scarlet Fever 61 (4 adults, 57 children) Diphtheria 18 (3 adults, 15 children) Enteric Fever 1 (an adult) Total 80 18 Two deaths occurred in children—one from a sudden attack of convulsions; the second patient was in a moribund condition on admission, and died a few hours after reaching the hospital. I can assure you, Gentlemen, that it has been no small satisfaction to me that out of the 80 cases admitted under my care I have to record only two deaths. I append the Tables of the Local Government Board, also the Report of the Health Visitor, which gives the details of her work from the middle of the year. Before concluding, I have to express my sincere thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their co-operation in the work during the year. The fact that matters which I have brought forward, or suggestions I have made, have always been carefully considered, has had a natural tendency to add to the interest of the work. I cannot speak too highly also of ths zeal and devotion which has characterised my staff in the discharge of their duties. I have, in conclusion, to tender them my warmest thanks for their conscientious work and loyal support during the year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FREDC. C. DODSWORTH.
