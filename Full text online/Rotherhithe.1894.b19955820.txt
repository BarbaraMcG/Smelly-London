Middleton's Steam Shipping Wharf Company, Limited, calling attention to a nuisance caused by children going down the 5-feet right of way at end of Odessa Street, and damaging goods in the craft lying at their wharf, and suggesting that gates be erected to prevent such nuisance, Hie A estry resolved that subject to the Company paying half the cost, gates be erected at the D-teet right of way at the end of Odessa Street, and the keys thereof placed in the hands of the proper authorities. Gates were subsequently constructed at the end of the right of way, Odessa Street, and a set of keys handed to Mr. Walter J. Watts, 8, Odessa Street, and also to Messrs. Middleton's Steam Shipping Wharf Company, 6, Odessa Street. 41 Mortuary. In accordance with the instructions of the Vestry, the Surveyor prepared drawings for the erection of a Mortuary and Post Mortem room, etc., which were adopted by the Vestry on 18th September, 1894, and ordered to be forwarded to the London County Council for their approval. The proposed Mortuary, etc., is to be erected on the site of the old Mortuary in the Burial Ground, St. Mary church Street. On the 25th October, 1894, a letter was received from the Council, making the following suggestions of a Committee of the Council:— "That in the opinion of the Committee the space round the Infectious Mortuary "might with advantage be increased. "That the gates of the Mortuary yard should be of sufficient width to admit a "hearse. "That the door to the Post Mortem room might with advantage be slightly "wider to facilitate the access of a coffin from the infectious chamber. "That air bricks should be inserted in the external walls and omitted from the walls in the viewing lobby and that this lobby should have good ventilation "in the roof; " and stating that subject to the foregoing suggestions the plan meets with the Committee's approval, and expressing the hope that the Vestry will proceed with the erection of the building without delay. The Vestry resolved to adopt the suggestions of the Council, and the Surveyor was instructed to alter the drawings in accordance therewith, and to prepare the specification and quantities for the building. The matter had not proceeded further at the close of the year. 42 Bull Head Dock and the Victoria OH Mills. The loan of £5,000 for the purchase of this property was taken up by the Vestry on 12th April, 1894, and placed on deposit with the Vestry's Bankers until required for the completion of the purchase. The completion of the purchase of the property was effected in May, 1894, and vacant possession given, subject to the right of the Lessees to remove their machinery from the Oil Mills within 30 days as provided by the contract. The Vestry resolved to effect an insurance of the buildings with the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company in the sum of £1,000. The question of the adaptation of the property having been referred to a Committee for consideration and report, the Vestry on 5th June, upon the recommendation of the Committee, passed the following resolution:— "That the Surveyor be instructed to prepare a plan showing the adaptation of the buildings to the requirements of the Vestry, the erection thereon of a Destructor, plant and equipment for the purposes of collection, removal and disposal of house and street refuse, etc., and also showing the existing Dock filled up and a concrete wall along the river frontage; and also an alternate plan showing new buildings on the east side of the existing Dock, with a Destructor, etc. on the west side, so as to utilise it possible the existing chimney-shaft, and submit an estimate of the cost thereof to a future meeting of the Committee." The Mostly also instiucted the Surveyor to prepare a plan showing the roadway in Rotherhithe Street widened by setting back the frontage line of the buildings, Bull Head Dock uid the Victoria Oil Mills, and also setting back the houses belonging to the Surrey Commercia! Dock Company on the land side, from the "Great Bnll's Head" P.H. to the Company's fence, and instructed the Clerk to write to the Directors of the Company to enquire whether, m the event of the Company pulling down the houses belonging to them in 43 Rotherhithe Street above-mentioned, they would be willing to set back the frontage line and thus assist the Vestry in carrying out a very necessary street improvement at that spot, and if so, upon what terms. On 3rd July, 1894, the Clerk reported that, acting upon the instructions of the Vestry, he had written to the Secretary to the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, asking whether in the event of the Company pulling down the houses belonging to them opposite Bull Head Dodt in Rotherhithe Street, they would be willing to set back the frontage line, and upon what terms; that the Surveyor had since seen Mr. McConnochie, the Company's Engineer, who stated that a Committee of the Directors were of opinion that the proposed improvement was a very desirable one, and recommended that if the Vestry would agree to erect a wall upon the Company's boundary, the small piece of land be conveyed to the Vestry. The Vestry thereupon resolved to agree to the terms of the Dock Company, and instructed the Surveyor to prepare an estimate of the total cost of widening Rotherhithe Street, and instructed the Clerk to apply to the London County Council for a contribution towards the cost of such improvement. The question of provision for the due care of the buildings having been referred to a Committee, the Vestry resolved upon the recommendation of the Committee, that Mr. Limpkin, the present caretaker, be temporarily appointed to take charge of the buildings at a salary of £1 per week, and house rent free, he to devote the whole of his time to the duties of the office, and that this arrangement be subject to a week's notice to quit on either side, and that in order to facilitate the proper overlooking of the buildings, the Surveyor be instructed to cause a gateway to be cut in the wall near the cottage, so as to provide a means of communication between Bull Head Dock and the Victoria Oil Mills, and thus obviate the necessity of passing along the river front. On the 19th June, 1894, the Committee reported to the Vestry that the Surveyor had, in accordance with their instructions, submitted two plans showing the proposed widening of Rotherhithe Street as under:— Plan A.—Showing the roadway widened on the north side from the line of the present widening next the King and Queen Granaries to the existing gateway entrance of the Victoria 44 Oil Mills and the south side by a parallel line giving a width of about 20 ft. 4 ins.; taking the following area into the street:-Bull Head Dock property 44 square yards, and Messrs. Younghusband, Barnes & Co. 30 square yards. PlanB.-Showing the roadway widened on the north side from the coinei of the existing office, Bull Head Dock, to the end of the Victoria Oil Mills, and on the south side by a parallel line giving a width of about 27 ft. 3 ins., taking into the street the following area : Bull Head Dock and Victoria Oil Mills 1G0 yards, Dock Company 23 square yards, and Messrs. Younghusband, Barnes & Co. 5 square yards; and it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that plan B be approved, with the exception of the setting back of the houses at the side of the Dock Company s premises opposite Bull Head Dock, and belonging to Messrs. Younghusband, Barnes & Co., the latter to remain in abeyance for the present. The clearing away of the machinery and fixtures at the Victoria Oil Mills was completed on the 18th January, 1894, and upon examination it was found that damage to the buildings had been occasioned to the extent of £15 10s., which amount was subsequently recovered from the Vendors in accordance with the terms of the Contract of Sale. The Vestry on 2nd October, 1894, resolved to utilise the premises for the storage of the water-carts during the winter, to utilise the Depot for the storage of ballast, sand, cement, etc., for use in Rotherhithe Street and neighbourhood, and also to cart surplus earth theie and deposit it in the old dock at the street end so as to get that end consolidated as soon as possible for the street improvement. The matter remained at this stage at the close of tho year. 45 Erection of Town Hall, Vestry Hall, Offices, etc- It will be remembered that last year the Vestry resolved to purchase the freehold and leasehold interests in Nos. 85 and 87 Neptune Street as an additional site for the above buildings, for the sum of £1250, subject to the sanction of the London County Council being obtained to borrow the money. The Council were approached on the matter, and on the 12th April, 1891, a letter was received from the Assistant Solicitor to the Council, stating that, subject to the Council hereafter giving their consent under seal to the proposed borrowing, and to the approval of the Treasury to the period proposed for the repayment of the loan, the Council were prepared to advance the Vestry £1250, upon condition that it was taken up at once and repaid by equal annual instalments on the 1st April, within 50 years, interest being charged on the amount for the time being outstanding at the rate of £8 10s. per cent, per annum, and paid quarterly on the 1st January, 1st April, 1st July and 1st October, and that the Vestry paid the costs of the loan, and asking if the Vestry would take up the loan on these terms. This the Vestry agreed to do, and the loan was taken up on the 2nd May, 1891, and the purchase of the property duly completed. On the 1st May, 1894, the Works Committee of the Vestry reported having inspected the ground plan of the site for the erection of the Town Hall, etc., buildings, prepared by the Surveyor to the Vestry, and expressed the opinion that it would be advisable to acquire the remaining two houses in Neptune Street (Nos. 81 and 83) inasmuch as such acquisition would obviate any question as to the forecourt line in Neptune Street, and would give a back entrance to the new buildings, thus materially improving the site; that they understood the interests of the two houses in question could be purchased for the sum of £1,150, which was £100 less than the price paid for Nos. 85 and 87, and that they had therefore instructed the Clerk to write to the parties interested for confirmation, subject to which they Recommended—That the Vestry approach the London County Council with the view of their granting a further loan of £1150 to purchase the property in question. 46 The Clerk reportad that, acting upon the instructions of the Commits, he had written to the parties interested in the property, and read joint letter he had received from Mr. R. W. Walker and Mr. G. Wildman, agreeing to sell their interests in the property for the sum of £800 net, the Vestry paying all costs; that he had not yet received a reply from Messrs. Still and Son, the Solicitors to the ground landlord, but he believed they would be willing to take £850 the same as the Vestry paid for the freehold interest in Nos, 85 and 87, Neptune Street. Resolved—That further letters be written to Messrs. Walker and Wildman, and to Messrs. Still and Son, asking them to take less sums than L'SOO anil 1350 respectively, and that the application to the London County Council stand over to await the result. This was done, but with no satisfactory result, and on 22nd May, 1894, the Vestry resolved to approach the London County Council with a view of borrowing a further sum of £1150 to purchase the freehold and leasehold interests in the houses known as 81 and 83, Neptune Street. The Council sanctioned the loan of £1150 for the purchase of the above property as a further site, and the loan was taken up on the 29th June, 1894, to be repaid by 50 annual instalments of £23, bearing interest at 3|- per cent. On the 17th July, 1895, the Works Committee reported to the Vestry that a ground plan ot the site of the new Town Hall, etc., showing the frontage line of the buildings, was submitted to them by the Surveyor, who reported that he had had an interview with the Superintending Architect ot the London County Council with reference to the building lines, who, whilst not binding himself until the actual depositing of the plans, said the Vestry would bo able to build up to the fiontage line of the Old Drill Hall upon the Lower Road, at the corner of Neptune Street, taking a straight line from the existing corner of the "Jolly Sailor" P.H., that with regard to the Neptune Street frontage, that street being over 40ft wide, and there being no other houses on that side of the street near the site, the buildings could be brought to the back line of the footway and about 10ft. from the kerb, in a straight line from the betore-described corner at the Lower Road to the corner of the existing fence on 47 the opposite corner of Moodkee Street; and that in reference to the Moodkee Street frontage, that must remain as at present; that the Surveyor had also submitted to them a plan showing the proposed lines, giving an available area of 1155 square yards ; When it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the plan showing the proposed lines be approved, and the Clerk be instructed to have a lithographed copy of the same issued to each of the competing Architects, together with a print of instructions. The Committee also reported having finally settled the instructions to Architects ; When it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the same be printed and issued forthwith, and that the 3rd day of September, 1894, be the last day for receiving competitive Designs. Six competitive Designs were received and referred by the Vestry on the 4th September, 1894, unopened, to the Works Committee, with power to act in the matter. On the 18th September, the Works Committee reported to the Vestry that the six competitive Designs for the erection of the Town Hall, etc., had been submitted to them unopened and sealed, that they had caused the same to be opened and marked respectively A, B, C, D, E and F, the envelopes containing the names of the Architects being similarly marked, that after very carefully inspecting the Designs they considered those marked A, B and D, to be the best, and had, upon the motion of Mr, Bisley, seconded by Mr. Wood, Resolved—That the Design marked A be placed first in the choice of selection, B second and D third, that they had therefore resolved, upon the motion of Mr. Bisley, seconded by Mr. Walker, that the Design marked A be adopted as the Design for the Town Hall, Vestry Hall, Offices, etc., and that on the envelopes containing the names of the competing Architects being opened, that marked A was found to contain the names of Messrs. Murray & Foster; that marked B, the name of Mr. Charles Bell; C, Mr. F. J. Smith ; D, Mr, A. B. Thomas; E, Mr. George E Iking ton; F, Mr. R. Walker. 48 The Vestry resolved not to exhibit the plans sent in by the competing Architects to the public until that selected by the Vestry had been approved by the London County Council. On the 18th September, 1804, the Vestry had before them a letter from Messrs. Murray and Foster asking for instructions to prepare the working drawings, and also the quantities, which was referred to a Committee for consideration and report, which Committee Recommended—That Messrs. Murray and Foster be engaged to prepare the working and other drawings and specifications, and to superintend the erection and completion of the buildings at the usual commission of 5 per cent, on the actual cost, the premium of ,£20 to merge in such commission, and that they also be appointed Quantity Surveyors, subject to their taking all responsibility as to the accuracy of the quantities. An amendment was moved by Mr. Stuart, and seconded by Mr. Board, and it was Resolved—That the portion of the report with reference to the appointment of Quantity Surveyors bo referred back to the Committee for reconsideration and report, the Clerk in the meantime to enquire of Messrs. Murray and Foster, their terms for preparing the quantities. Messrs. Murray and I'ostor having notified their willingness to prepare the quantities for the buildings for 1 per cent., the Vestry resolved to appoint Messrs. Murray and Foster Quantity Surveyors upon those terms. The Vestry also resolved to apply for the sanction of the London County Council to raise a loan of .£20,000 to complete the Town Hall Buildings, furnish the same and pay Architects'Commission, etc., and to ask the Council to lend a sum of £10,000 as a first instalment of the said loan. This the Council agreed to do upon the terms that it was taken up on or befor 1st February, 1895 and repaid with interest at the rate of £3 5s. per cent. per annum, calculated quarterly, by equal half-yearly instalments of principal and interest combined within 30 years, and that the Vestry paid the costs of the loan. The Coucil also stated that 49. with regard to the second instalment not yet dealt with, the Finance Committee would be prepared to favourably consider a further application for the sanction and loan of that amount, and that the application should be made about a month before the money was required. The Vestry instructed the Clerk to take up the first instalment of the loan upon the terms mentioned on receipt of the money to place the same on deposit with the London and Midland Bank at an agreed rate, and to make application to the Council for the second instalment when required. The first instalment of the loan was taken up on 6th February, 1895, and placed on deposit with the London and Midland Bank, at a minimum rate of interest of 1^ per cent. Upon the recommendation of the Works Committee, the Vestry resolved, with the view of providing increased accommodation in the Hall, to substitute columns for the partitions forming the corridor, thus giving space for 150 more persons, and that to still further enlarge the Hall, instructed the Clerk to apply to the London County Council for their sanction to extend the frontage line in Moodkee Street to the line of the forecourts in that street. With reference to the extension of the frontage line in Moodkee Street, on the 6th November, 1894, the Vestry passed the following resolution:— "That in the event of the application of the Vestry to bring out the frontage line of the proposed Town Hall, etc., to the line of the forecourts in Moodkee Street being granted, the Vestry will agree to give up all the land between the front of the building in the Lower Boad and the footpath there for the use of the public, and that the Clerk be and he is hereby instructed to at once address a letter to Mr. Williams, L.C.C., to that effect." And on the 6th December, 1894, a letter was received from Messrs. Murray and Foster, enclosing form they had just received from the Council, giving them the first official intimation that the Council had granted their application on behalf of the Vestry for the line of frontage for the Town Hall, etc., and stating that the building lines in Moodkee Street would therefore be in line with the adjoining forecourts, and the building lines in Lower Boad and Neptune Street the same as those shown on the original block plan sent them by the Vestry, and also stating that they were now ready to fix the exact depths for the foundations 50 Of the walls of the building, and asking that some trial holes might be dug out so that they could inspect the strata, and enclosing plan showing the positions of the required holes. The Surveyor was instructed to have the said trial holes dug out in accordance with the plans received from Messrs. Murray and Foster. The following is a copy of the recommendation of the Building Act Committee of the Council, which was approved by the Council on 4th December, 1894, referred to in the above-mentioned letter:— "That the application of Messrs. Murray and Foster, on behalf of the Vestry of Rotherhithe, for the consent of the Council to the erection of a Town Hall, on the north-east side of Lower Road, Rotherhithe, at the corner of Neptune Street, and also abutting upon Moodkee Street, to the lines shown on the deposited plans, dated 24th November, 1894, be granted, subject to the condition that the erection therein referred to be commenced within six months and completed within eighteen months, from the 4th day of December, 1894 ; that the whole of the land coloured blue on the amended block plan be dedicated to the use of the public ; that no pier, pilaster, or other projection be placed on such land, notwithstanding the provisions of section 2G, sub-section 2, of the Metropolitan Building Act, 1855, to the contrary; that the erection be made in entire conformity with the letter of application and as shown on the plans accompanying it, and be not at any time in any manner altered or raised without the consent of the Council; also upon condition that if the plans or application be hereafter found to be inaccurate in any particular, the foregoing consent of the Council shall be null and void." On 1st February, 1895, a letter was received from the Clerk to the Council, notifying tho approval by the Council of the six drawings, dated 7th January, 1895, for the erection of a Hall, and stating that the work in connection therewith must be commenced within Six months and completed in accordance with the provisions of the London Building Act, 1894, and that upon the Theatres and Music Halls Committee reporting to the Council the completion of the buildings in conformity with the approved drawings, a certificate under the Metropolis Management and Building Act Amendment Act, 1878, would be sealed 51 and issued to the Vestry, but that the issue of such certificate would not preclude the Council from considering on its merits any application which might thereafter be made with reference to the licensing of the building for public entertainments. The competitive plans were subsequently exhibited to the public at the Public Library in the Lower Road. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. General. ROADWAY, SOUTHWARK PARK; CHEAP TRAINS; FREE FERRY, ROTHERHITHE AND WAPPING. On 18th September, 1894, the Vestry had before them a letter, dated 12th September, 1894, from Mr. R. Fairbairn, the Hon. Sec. to the Rotherhithe and Bermondsey Labour Electoral League, stating that a Deputation from the League would wait upon the Vestry, on Tuesday, 18th September, 1894, at 7 p.m., and present a Memorial. The Deputation was introduced to the Vestry by Mr. Bisley, a member of the Vestry; Mr. Fairbairn, the Hon. Sec., acting as spokesman. Mr. Fairbairn handed in a Memorial, which was read by the Clerk, praying the Vestry to approach the South Eastern, and London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Companies, with reference to increasing the facilities for cheap workmen's trains ; to urge upon the London County Council the desirability of throwing open the main roadway through Southwark Park to a later hour at night and at an earlier hour in the morning; and also to represent to the Council the necessity for a direct communication across the river Thames by means of a Free Ferry. The Memorial was referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report, and it was ultimately Resolved upon the recommendation of that Committee:— 1.—That the Clerk write to the South Eastern Railway Company and tho London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company, urging them to make a reduction 62 in the fares for working men to and from the City and West End of the Metropolis, and also drawing the attention of the Sonth Eastern Railway Company to the long delay which has taken place in the erection by them of a new station near Rotherhithe New Road, and asking them to give the matter their early attention, as tho want of such station is very much felt by working men and others having daily business in the City. 2.—That a Memorial be drawn up and presented to the London County Council from this Vestry, urging upon them the necessity of having the main roadway through Southwark Park opened at a much earlier hour and kept open until midnight, and that the Vestry of Bermondsey be asked to present a similar Memorial, and also to appoint certain of their members to attend with this Vestry as a Deputation to the Council in support of the same, and that the County Councillors of the Division be written to, asking them to use their influence in favour thereof when the matter comes before the Council. 3.—That a Memorial be presented to the London County Council, urging upon them the necessity of establishing more direct communication between Rotherhithe and Wapping, and asking the Council to apply during the next Session of Parliament for the necessary powers for establishing a Free Ferry from this Parish to Wapping, and for making the necessary approaches thereto. The following Memorials were prepared by the Clerk and approved of by the Vestry, who ordered the Common Seal of the Vestry to be affixed thereto respectively To the London County Council. The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe in the County of London, under its Common Seal: Sheweth, That in the year 1893, and previously, your Memorialists, in the interests of the working population of Rotherhithe and Bermondsey, petitioned your Honorable Council, in conjunction with the Vestry of the Parish of Bermondsey, to keep open the mam roadway through Southwark Park daily until midnight. 53 As a result, your Honorable Council determined to open the said roadway at 6 o'clock a.m., and to keep the same open until the hour of 9 o'clock p.m. during the summer, and 8 o'clock p.m. during the winter. That although this concession has proved of advantage to the working people who live in Rotherhithe and whose business is in Bermondsey and vice versa, yet the hours are scarcely sufficiently early or late to enable them to proceed to and from their daily work, and many have still to go a long way round, which they feel to be a great hardship. That it would be conferring a great boon upon such working people if your Honorable Council would determine to open the said roadway daily at 4 o'clock in the morning and keep it open until 10 o'clock at night. That your Memorialists see no reason to alter their opinion as to it being unnecessary to fence off the said roadway, and they urge your Honorable Council to undertake the cost of lighting and watching the same at the sole cost of your Honorable Council, / in the same manner as is done in many other of the public Parks under your control, where roads are kept open for public convenience long after the Parks themselves are closed for the night. Your Memorialists therefore pray that your Honorable Council will extend the benefits they have already conferred upon the working population of Rotherhithe and Bermondsey, by keeping the said roadway through Southwark Park open daily from 4 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, and that your Honorable Council will undertake the entire cost of lighting and watching the same. And your Memorialists will ever pray, etc. The Seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe affixed hereto by order this Sixteenth day of October, 1894. JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk. The Seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe. 54 To the London County Council. The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the County of London, under their Common Seal . Rhemeth That your Memorialists are of opinion that, having regard to the requirements of the District, the establishment of a Free Ferry between Piotherhithe and Wapping is urgently needed, and should no longer be delayed, and they therefore pray That your Honourable Council will, in the next Session of Parliament, proceed to obtain powers for the establishment of a Free Ferry from your Memorialists' Parish to the opposite side of the river, and for making the necessary approaches thereto ; but avoiding in such approaches any interference with the churchyard of the Parish Church of St. Mary and the Burial Ground in St. Marychurch Street within your Memorialists' Parish, and that your Honourable Council will proceed in the matter with all possible dispatch. And your Memorialists will ever pray, etc. The Seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe affixed hereto by order this Sixteenth Day of October, 1894. JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk. The seal of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe. On the 10th October, 1894, a letter was received from the Secretary and Manager of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company in reply to the Vestry's letter re Cheap Trains, stating that the Company already ran a large number of workmen's trains serving the districts mentioned and enclosing particulars of trains and fares, and the South Eastern Railway Company simply acknowledged the letter. 55 Resolved—That the same be received and that the Clerk be instructed to write to the Joint Committee of the East London Railway, asking them to provide further facilities in the way of cheap trains for workmen. This was done, and a letter was received in reply stating that the Committee already had a service of workmen's trains, and that the trains were very thinly attended indeed, and that ample accommodation was provided for many more than offer to travel. No further action was taken by the Vestry in the matter. On the 20th November, 1894, Mr. Payne, L.C.C., informed the Yestry that ho believed the Council were willing to keep the main roadway through Southwark Park open until 10 o'clock at night upon certain conditions, and suggested that the Yestry should appoint a Committee to confer with the Yestry of Bermondsey. The Vestry accordingly Resolved that Messrs. F. T. Talbot, Stuart, Walker, and Moss be, and they are hereby appointed to attend on behalf of this Vestry as a deputation, jointly with the members appointed by the Yestry of Bermondsey, to the London County Council in support of the Memorial relative to the roadway through Southwark Park. It was also Resolved that the Clerk write to the London County Council asking for an appointment for the deputation to attend, and that in the meantime the delegates appointed by this Vestry and the Vestry of Bermondsey, and Messrs. Payne, L.C.C., and Williams, L.C.C., meet in conference to decide as to the action to be adopted. On the 4th December, 1894, Mr. Bisley moved, Mr. Mortimer seconded, and it was Resolved—That the delegates from this Vestry be authorised to discuss with the delegates appointed by the Yestry of Bermondsey the question of the lighting of the roadway through Southwark Park with the view, if necessary, of the two Parishes mutually bearing the cost thereof, with the exception of the lighting of the gates at each end, which should be borne by the Council. Mr. Stuart, as one of the delegates appointed by the Vestry, protested against the foregoing resolution, and asked to be relieved and some one else appointed in his stead. The Vice-Chairman, Mr. F. J. Bisley, was appointed in the place of Mr. Stuart. 56 On 5th February, 1895, Mr. Bisley reported that the Joint Deputation from this Vestry and the Vestry of Bermondsey attended before the Parks Committee of the London County Council, and endeavoured to present as strong a case as possible for the opening of the roadway, but that every possible objection was raised by the Committee, who stated that it was no use coming there unless they were prepared with a scheme whereby the local authorities would take over, maintain and light the roadway, and he was therefore afraid nothing would be done unless the local authorities agreed to do this. Resolved (Mr. Stuart, Mr. Brownfield)—That in view of the unsatisfactory result of the Conference, the matter stand adjourned until after the London County Council Election. On the 23rd November, 1894, a letter was received from the Clerk to the London County Council, stating the Council had had under consideration, the Memorial from this Vestry on the subject of the need of additional means of communication between Rotherhithe and the other side of the river, and that he was directed to inform the Vestry that the Council realised the necessity of means of crossing at the part of the river referred to, but did not deem it expedient to move in the matter until further progress had been made with the works of the Blackwall Tunnel, as it was hoped that the experience which the Council would lave gained in the course of a lew months, would enable it to arrive at a conclusion on the question in which the Vestry and the inhabitants of Rotherhithe were naturally so much interested. 57 Surrey Commercial Dock Scheme As a result of the Conference between a Deputation from this Vestry and a Commits of the Directors of the Dock Company, the Directors agreed as under:— To the extension of Sec. 21 of the Bill, so as to include all houses taken, and accommodation being provided for all persons displaced. To reimburse the Vestry an equivalent for loss of rates during the progress and completion of the works. To pitch the new roads in the same way as the old ones (but will only maintain them for one year instead of three years as desired by the Vestry). That there shall be no cul de sac at the bottom of William Street, Maynard Road, and Osprey Street, but a through communication. That the new bridges shall be so constructed as to allow of a double line vehicular traffic with a footpath on either side. And upon being reported to the Vestry on 3rd April, 1894, it was Resolved—To adhere to the original conditions laid down with regard to the maintenance of the new roads, viz., that the roads be maintained by the Company in good repair for three years from date of opening of such roads to traffic. On the 3rd April, 1894, the Vestry passed the following resolution:— "That this Vestry recognises the necessity of a roadway between Derrick Street and Grove Street, Deptford, and that the officers of the Vestry be authorised t give evidence to that effect before a Committee of the House of Commons." Also Resolved—" That the Vestry of Deptford be asked to receive a Deputation from this Vestry with the view of their co-operation in the manner indicated in the previous resolution, and that the following gentlemen form such Deputation — Messrs. Painter, Messrs. Wells, Bisley, Wood, Stuart, Bellsham. Miller, 58 On 17th April 1895, the Clerk reported to the Vestry that he had been in communication with the London County Council, with reference to the Surrey Commercial Dock Company's Bill and that the Surveyor had seen Mr. Binnie, as to the evidence to be given with reference to the proposed new road from Derrick Street to Grove Street, Deptford, and that local evidence of an influential character would have to be adduced in support thereof. It was also elicited from Mr. Howell J. Williams, one of the Rotherhithe representatives on the Council, that the Parliamentary Committee of the Council were considering the Bill, which they had already arranged to oppose, so as to get a locus standi; that with reference to the proposed new road between Derrick Street and Grove Stieet, Deptford, the Council had only taken the matter up on the understanding that influential evidence of a local character would be brought to bear in support there of; that the Council would not treat the improvement as a Metropolitan one; and that if the Yestry wished the thing to succeed, they would do well to agree to contribute something towards the cost of the improvement. It was thereupon Resolved—That the Vestry contribute a sum not exceeding £5000 towards the cost of making the new road to connect this Parish with Deptford from Derrick Street to Grove Street, and that Mr. Howell J. Williams, the Rotherhithe representative at the London County Council, be asked to bring the matter before the Parliamentary Committee of the Council. On 1st May, 1894, the Clerk reported that he attended at the House of Commons, when the Bill was in Committee; that Mr. Bidder, Q.C., represented the London County Council, and that a representative from the Union Oil and Cake Mills, Limited; Mr. Miller; Mr. Howell J. Williams, L.C.C., Captain Simmonds, of the Fire Brigade; Mr. Binnie, the Engineer to the London County Council; and the Surveyor to the Vestry and others were called to give evidence as to the necessity for the formation of a carriageway from Derrick Street, Rotherhithe, to Grove Stieet, Deptford, and that the Committee after hearing the evidence on the part of the Dock Company, and the Council, stated through the Chairman that they could not see their way to include the provision of this new road in the Company's Bill. June, 1894, it was reported by the Clerk to the Vestry that he had had interviews with the Secretary of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company on 59 the subject of the maintenance of the new roads to be formed under their new Bill now before Parliament, and that he had received the following letter from Mr. Griffin :— "Referring to our several conversations on the subject of the new roads to be made under the provisions of the Bill, I am willing to agree, on the part of my Company, that on the Bill becoming an Act, and when and after the roads are completed under the powers of the Act, the extra cost of repairs of such roads for a period of 18 months after the roads shall have been so completed, viz., the difference between what it would cost to repair the roads in the ordinary way and the actual cost of repairs of the said roads, to be borne by the Dock Company, the amount, if any, to be settled by the Surveyor for the Parish Authorities and the Engineer of the Dock Company, and failing their being able to arrive at a settlement, then to be left to the decision of an Umpire, to be agreed upon between the said Surveyor and the said Engineer." The matter was referred to a Committee for consideration and report, and on the 19th June the Committee reported to the Yestry that a resolution had already been passed by the Yestry to adhere to their former resolution in the matter, viz., that the Company should maintain the roads for three years from the opening of such roads, which resolution they recommended should be rescinded, and the terms of the Dock Company agreed to. This having been Resolved upon by the Yestry, the following Notice of Motion was then given by Mr. Stuart:— "I hereby give notice that, at the next meeting of the Vestry, I shall move that so much of the resolution passed by the Yestry on the 20th day of February, 1894, to the effect that the Surrey Commercial Dock Company be required to maintain in good repair for three years from the date of opening to traffic, the new roads to be constructed under the powers of their Bill now before Parliament, and also the resolution passed on the 3rd April, 1894, confirming and adhering to the said resolution, be rescinded." Dated this 19th June, 1894. (Signed) R. L. STUART. The above was duly moved at the following meeting of the Yestry on the 3rd July, 1894, and carried by the requisite majority, and it was Resolved accordingly. The Bill became an Act on the 3rd July, 1894. 60 On 17th April, 1894, a letter was submitted to the Yestry from Messrs. Lawrence and Co of 21, Mincing Lane, and endorsed by Messrs. Middleton's Steam Shipping Wharf Co., Atkin's Wharf; The Union Oil and Cake Mills, Limited, 251, Eotherhithe Street; G. and H. Green, Canada Wharf, Eotherhithe Street; E. Monk, 259, Eotherhithe Street; Perkins and Homer, Dantzic Wharf, Eotherhithe Street; Mills and Knight, Nelson Dock, Eotherhithe Street; and Burt, Boulton and Haywood, Durand's Wharf, Eotherhithe Street; drawing attention to the gradients at the approaches to the several swing bridges erected by the Dock Company at their entrances in Eotherhithe Street, at Lavender 1 )ock Liidge, and also at Lady Dock Bridge in Commercial Dock Eoad, and stating that the gradients at these bridges were so excessively steep that importers of goods frequently refused to store them at wharves which could only be reached from land by passage across the bridges, and that not only were extra horses required for each load to enable them to mount the bridges, but the strain on the animals was so great as to amount to cruelty, with the probability of lasting injury being inflicted on them, and suggesting that the Yestry should require that the incline of these gradients should be greatly reduced, and stating that they considered the scheme of the Dock Company should be opposed unless they undertook to make this much-needed improvement. "Whereupon, Mr. Bisley moved, Mr. Wells seconded, and it was Eesolved—That in view of the want of footholds adapted to two horses abreast at Lavender Dock and Lady Dock Liidges, a letter be written to the Dock Company drawing their attention to the fact and asking them to widen the footholds accordingly, so as to obviate cruelty to the horses. The question of the gradient at the approach to Lavender Dock Bridge was referred to the Surveyor to report thereon. on the 17th July, 1894, the Surveyor reported that the Engineer to the Dock Company med him that he had obtained the new tram stones for the Lavender Bridge approach , and that it would be necessary to close the roadway to put them in, which could ame time as any alteration to the Bridge covering; that the Engineer was prepared to plank the same over with hard wood, with narrow flat iron strips across the ctij Mould agree to the roadway being narrowed from 10ft. to 8ft. and make 61 the necessary alterations to the kerbs and footways on either side to meet the narrowed guard rails over the Bridge. The Vestry subsequently Resolved to agree to the narrowing of the roadway at Lavender Bridge from 10ft. to 8ft., on condition that the entire width be planked over with wood in lieu of the present longitudinal iron plates, and that narrow strips of iron be placed across the centre of the roadway for a width of 5ft., so as to provide proper footholds for a pair of horses travelling abreast, but not to project more than 3/8 ths. of an inch above the wood planking. Fulford Street and Br add on Street Insanitary Area. The attention of the Vestry having been drawn to the insanitary condition of some of the houses in Braddon Street, The Vestry resolved that temporary closing orders be applied for in respect of Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, Braddon Street, so as to get them put into habitable repair. On 3rd April, 1894, the Vestry resolved to call the attention of Mr. Williams, the newly elected County Councillor, to the state of the houses in Braddon Street, etc., with the view of his using his influence with the Council to deal with the Improvement Scheme in the unhealthy area submitted to the Council by the Vestry on 14th February, 1893, and on 4th December, 1894, a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council was submitted to the Vestry, stating that a Committee of the Council were dealing with the matter and would be glad to confer with the Vestry as to the steps to be taken in reference thereto, and asking the Vestry to appoint representatives to meet the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council at their offices in Spring Gardens, on Wednesday, 12th December, 1894, at 11.30 a.m. Upon the motion of Mr. Stuart, the Vestry Resolved to appoint representatives to confer with the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council, as requested. 62 The following gentlemen were then appointed representatives of the Yestry, to confer with the Committee of the Council relative to the Insanitary Area, together with the Clerk, Medical Officer of Health, and Chief Sanitary Inspector : The Chairman: Eev. Canon Beck, M.A., J.P. The Vice-Chairman : Mr. F. J. Bisley ; and Messrs. F. T. Talbot, Walker, and Rooney. And on 18th December, 1894, the Chairman reported that on Wednesday, the 12th December, 1894, the Deputation appointed by the Vestry to wait upon the London County Council with reference to the representation made by the Medical Officer of Health under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as to an insanitary area between Paradise Street and Eotherhithe Street, attended before the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council, and were received and introduced by Messrs. Payne and Williams; that after making their statement to the Council that the Yestry had done all which lay in their power to deal with this insanitary area under Part I. of the Act, and had been waiting for the Council to move further in the matter, they were informed by the Chairman of the Committee that it was the opinion of the Council that the Yestry should proceed under Part II. of the Act, by which method the Council would contribute towards the cost. A letter dated 14th December, 1894, was subsequently received from the Council, enclosing plan, showing a method suggested by the Committee of laying out the area under Part II. of the Act. The lettei and subject matter were referred back to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report. The Vestry subsequently passed the following resolutions in reference to the matter:— That in view of the poorness of the Parish and the large sums of money contributed by this Vestry to the Council which have been expended on other parts of the Metropolis, the Council be informed that the Vestry do not approve of the scheme and plan as forwarded by them, under Part II. of the Act, the area being in the opinion of the Vestry too large to be dealt with under Part II., the Vestry urge upon the Council the necessity for carrying out the work forth with under Part I., and in accordance with the plan forwarded to 63 them by the Yestry: also that the Council's attention be called to the pledge publicly given to the Rotherhithe representative (Mr. Howell J. Williams) by the Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, that the Committee would deal with the matter without delay." 2.—"That the Clerk at the same time inform the London County Council that, in the opinion of the Yestry, the time has now come when the Council should forward to the Local Government Board the official representation sent to them by the Medical Officer of Health for Rotherhithe, Dr. Josephus Shaw, dated 14th February, 1893, together with the reasons they have not acted upon it, as required by section 10 of 53 and 54 Yic., cap. 70 (Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890) and that he further remind the Council of their duty under section 7 of the Working Classes Act, 1885, which is not repealel by the Act of 1890." On 21st February, 1895, the Vestry were notified of the following resolution passed by the Council on 12th February, 1895 :— "That the Fulford Street and Braddon Street area comprised in the official representation of the Medical Officer of Rotherhithe, dated 14th February, 1893, is not of general importance to the County of London, and should be dealt with under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and that the Vestry of Rotherhithe be informed that if a satisfactory scheme is presented for dealing with the area, the Council is willing to contribute half the net ccst under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act." The Vestry Resolved to send a further Deputation to the Council on the subject, and the following gentlemen were appointed to form such Deputation:— Mr. Bisley, Vice-Chairman; Messrs. F. T. Talbot, Stuart, Rooney, Vezev, Beasley, and Fester. A Special Committee of the Vestry was called for Friday, 22nd March, 1895, to further consider the matter before sending the Deputation to the Council, which reported having 64 conferred with Mr. Payne, L.C.C., on the subject, who stated that if the Vestry did not see their way to accept the offer of the Council to contribute half the net cost of a scheme for dealing with the area, the matter would be submitted to the Homo Secretary for arbitration, and if that were done it was more than likely the Vestry might have to bear a larger proportion of the expense ; that the cost of dealing with the area was estimated by the Council at £20,000 with a recoupment of £3,000, leaving a net cost of £17,000, that the value of the freehold reversion was included in the said sum of .£3,000, and that if tho\ estiy accepted the terms of the Council, they would then have to decide as to whether they would carry out a scheme themselves or allow the Council to do so; that the land would have to be let on long leases or sold outright for purposes of building artizans' and laborers' dwellings, and that money could be borrowed from the Council for a period of 50 years at 3 1/8 per cent. In view of the statement made by Mr. Payne, the Vestry Resolved to accept the offer of the Council to contribute half the net cost of dealing with the area, and not to send the Deputation to the Council. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. Combined Drainage. A Conference having been convened by the Holborn District Board of Works, to be held at the Holborn Town Hall, on thursday, 17th May, 1894, at two o'clock, to consider what action could bo taken to obtain an alteration of the law with regard to Combined Drainage, and delegates having been invited to attend the Conference, The Vestry Resolved on April 17th, 1894, to appoint Messrs. F. T. Talbot and Moss, with the Surveyor, to attend such Conference on behalf of the Vestry. The Conference was duly held, and the following resolutions passed "That a Memorial be presented to the London County Council, calling attention difficulties which Lave been experienced by Local Sanitary Authorities in dealing with questions of Combined Drainage, and the responsibilities of the 65 said Local Authorities in reference thereto, and that the Council be requested to take steps with the view of obtaining an amendment of the definition of the word 'Drain' in Section 250 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, by adding thereto, after the word 'Board,' the following words, viz.:— 'And any drain, the plan of which has not been approved as a sewer under Sec. 69 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and Sections 45 and 48 of the Metropolis Local Management (Amendment) Act, 18G2.' " "That the London County Council be asked to receive a Deputation from this Conference, and that the Secretary be requested to communicate with the Council in order to get a day fixed for the Deputation to attend with the Memorial." On the 7th January, 1895, a letter was received from the Yestry of St. Mary, Islington, enclosing copy of a letter addressed by that Vestry to the London County Council, asking them to receive a Deputation from that Vestry and other local authorities, re Combined Drainage; also a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council stating that the Main Drainage Committee of the Council had resolved to receive, on Thursday, 24th January, 1895, at 3 p.m., a joint Deputation from all the Vestries and District Boards which might desire to be represented on the occasion, with reference to the same subject; and also a letter from the Holborn District Board of Works drawing attention to the above letter, and inviting the delegates appointed to a Conference at the Holborn Town Hall, on Monday, 21st January, 1895, at 2.30 p.m., to arrange as to the course of action to be adopted when before the Council. Messrs. F. T. Talbot and R. W. Moss, who attended as delegates at the Holborn Conference in May, 1894, were appointed to attend on both of the above occasions as representing this Vestry, together with the Surveyor. On 5th February, 1895, Mr. F. T. Talbot reported that Mr. Moss, the Surveyor, and himself attended the Conference at the Holborn Town Hall, on Monday, 21st January, 1895, when the resolutions of the previous Conference were confirmed, and it was agreed that Mr. Dewey, the Vestry Clerk of Islington, should open the case on behalf of the combined Deputation before the Main Drainage Committee of the Council, on Thursday, 21th January, 1895. 66 The Clerk reported that, with Mr. Moss and the Surveyor, he attended the meeting of delegates at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, on Thursday, 20th January, 1895, and that after the matter had been laid before the Main Drainage Committee by Mr. Dewey, the Yestry Clerk of Islington, and thoroughly discussed, the Chairman promised that the Committee would give the matter full consideration with the view of bringing in a Bill to amend the law with reference to Combined Drainage. Nothing further was done in the matter at the close of the year. Unemployed. On the 18th December, 1894, the Yestry instructed the Surveyor to open a Register in which to enter the names and addresses of all unemployed men applying for work, provided they were residents in the Parish, such men to be taken on as occasion might require. On the 15th January, 1895, the Vestry received a Deputation from the Guardians of the St. Olave's Union with reference to finding work for the unemployed of the Union. The Deputation consisted of the following gentlemen:— Mr. A. Shand, Chairman of the Guardians (Spokesman) ; and Messrs. Burton, Collins, Kissane, McCarthy, and the Rev. J. S. Lidgett. Mr. Shand , in addressing the Vestry, stated, that in order to relieve the distress amongst the unemployed, the Guardians had, on the previous Monday week, opened their Stone Yard, which unfortunately had the effect of drawing men from all parts of London into the Common Lodging Houses in the Union. On the Monday 150 men were employed, on the Tuesday 513 applied and were indiscriminately given work, but on the Wednesday in consequence of running out of stone the Yard had to be closed. An Emergency Meeting was then called at which a Deputation was appointed to wait upon the Local Government Loard. The Guardians were paying (3d. an hour (3d. in money, and 3d. in kind) to which the Local Government Board objected, but the Guardians remained firm in this respect, and subsequently a tariff was agreed to, whereby married men with families resident in the Union were to receive preference to those who were single. 67 That unfortunately through the employment of any one who applied, young men who had never earned a guinea a week in their lives before, had been selling the food they received in the streets at half price, but this would be altered now, as from 6 to 8 Inquiry Officers and 9 Overseers had been appointed. That this meant a great expense, and an increase of from l0d. to 1s. in the pound on the poor rate, and also pauperised the men and deprived them of their votes for the next two years. That on Monday 7 Eotherhithe men applied, on Tuesday 133, on Wednesday 30, on Thursday 55, on Friday G3, on Saturday 103, on Monday 268, and on that day no less than 350. He therefore urged the Yestry to do all they could to give work to these men and take them off the Union. The Chairman, in reply, stated that the Vestry were quite in sympathy with the unemployed movement, and informed the Deputation that a register had already been opened at the Stone Yard, and the Surveyor instructed to employ casual men on the roads as much as possible. The Vestry ultimately instructed the Clerk to call an Emergency Meeting of the General Purposes and Works Committee, for Thursday, 17th January, 1895, at 11 a.m., to consider as to what steps could be taken with reference to the unemployed in the Parish, with power to act in the matter. The Committee met and carefully went into the matter ; they found that the total number of names upon the register opened by the Surveyor was 277, and that a day's work had up till then been given to 189 men, and that preference had and would be given to married men with families, also that there were 14 men working on the sewer in Albion Street, that the Town Hall building operations would not afford any immediate relief, as there were still certain formalities to be gone through before the work could be commenced; that before the old Mortuary could be pulled down, provision would have to be made for temporary Mortuary accommodation, and with the view of starting that work at once the Committee made application to the Guardians of the St. Olave's Union for the temporary use of their Mortuary at the Infirmary in the Lower Eoad, and inspected the same, but elicited from them that the Mortuary in question was not large enough to afford adequate accommodation for the 68 Guardians themselves. They also ascertained that there was a scarcity of unbroken stone, it being very difficult, if not impossible, to get it, and that therefore the Yestry could not employ men to break stone required by them; but they found that the Vestry had in stock about 30 tons of old pitchers and also a barge of ballast. They therefore Resolved that it be an instruction to the Surveyor to extend as far as possible the employment of the unemployed resident in the Parish; that ho be authorised to temporarily increase, when necessary, the sweeping staff by one-third, viz., 10 men, also to start men to break up the thirty tons of old pitchers in stock; and that he be instructed to at once order another barge load of ballast and employ men to screen the same in conjunction with the ballast in stock. The Guardians of St. Olave's Union were informed of the action taken by the Yestry in the matter. Upon the application of the Guardians, the Yestry allowed them the use of the west side of Bull Head Dock and the Victoria Oil Mills, with the exception of that part of the Mills which immediately faces the Caretaker's premises, as a temporary Labour Yard, at a weekly rental of £5, subject to their taking all risks in the matter and making good any damage which might be done to the property; to their paying rates and taxes ; to their electing proper sanitary conveniences for the use of the men to be employed there ; and to their doing all the repairs necessary to adapt the premises as a Stone Yard under the superintendence and to the satisfaction of the Surveyor. 69 Parish Boundary Stones. On the 19th June, 1894, the Clerk reported to the Yestry that the Ordnance Survey Department were making a New Ordnance Map, and that it was found, on comparing the existing map with those of years since, that the boundary stones did not agree with the old boundary lines, the variations extending several feet; that the Ordnance Survey Department thought it would be well to adhere to the boundaries as indicated by the old maps, but to carry out that proposal would incur considerable expense, as some of the inscriptions were obliterated, whilst others were wrongly worded ; that some of the stones were buried in the ground, and others, he believed, were in the Docks. The Vestry Resolved—That it be referred to the Surveyor to report as to the existing boundary stones in the parish, and that the Clerk be instructed to enquire from the Ordnance Survey Department their terms for supplying tracings of the Ordnance Map now in course of preparation, showing the existing discrepancies. On the 18th September, 1894, the Surveyor reported that he had been in communication with the Ordnance Survey Department with reference to the boundary stones of the parish, and that it was thought desirable that where the differences were only very small the stones should remain, and the boundaries on the new plans altered to suit them, subject to an amicable arrangement between the interested parishes, but that where the differences were too great to allow of such an arrangement, Conferences should be arranged between the different Authorities to settle the correct boundaries. Resolved—That a Special Committee of five Members be appointed to go into the matter, and that each of the parishes of Bermondsey, Camberwell, and Deptford be invited to send a similar number to meet and consider the matter, and that the following members be appointed for this parish:— Messrs. Walker, Chambers, Bisley, F. T. Talbot, and Streeton. The Committee met, and on the 4th December, 1894, reported having met at Midway Place, corner of Bush Road, and having thence inspected the boundary stones dividing the 70 parishes of Deptford and Rotherhithe, which were at variance with the boundary appearing on the Ordnance Map, and after consultation with the Deptford representatives, had agreed that the boundary stones as then existing be adopted and adhered to, This was approved by the Yestry. The Vestry also Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That a stone be placed at the western end of Midway Place, against the Railway fence, 5ft. north of the junction of Railway and School, by and at the expense of the Vestry of Rotherhithe; that a stone be placed in the centre of the party wall of No. 93, Eugenia Road and Alpine Road, by and at the expense of the Vestry of Deptford; that a stone be placed at the rear of No. 29, Alpine Road, at the junction of the boundary fences on the west side of Alpine Road and the north side of Reculver Road, at the joint expense of this Vestry and the Vestry of Deptford; that the existing stone at the south-eastern end of the Yeoman Saw Mills, which then showed the boundary to be 8 ft. from the face thereof, be re-cut to read "12ft. Gin.;" that the existing stone in the side wall of No. 52, Croft Street, be re-faced and re-cut at the expense of the Vestry of Rotherhithe; and that it be an instruction to the Surveyor to have the year "1894" cut into all the stones visited and belonging or partly belonging to the Vestry of Rotherhithe. The Committee reported receipt of a letter from the Vestry of Bermondsey, stating that they had decided to take no action in the matter of the boundary stones: also a letter from the Clerk to the Churchwardens and Overseers of Camberwell, stating that the stones were fixed, after arrangement between the two Surveyors of the respective parishes, by the Vestry of Rotherhithe, after consultation with and at the direction of the Overseers of both parishes, and that the Board had therefore decided that their positions as at present be adhered to. The Committee also reported that from a report of the late Surveyor of Pavements, it appeared that the boundaries of the parish were inspected in the year 188G, and agreed upon between the parishes concerned, and "1886" ordered to be cut upon all the boundary stones then in existence, and that several new stones were provided and others repaired where necessary. 71 Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That the boundary stones as at present existing, be adopted and adhered to. Renaming of Streets, Complaint having been received from the Postmaster of the South Eastern District Post Office, drawing attention to the difficulty experienced in distinguishing the name of the thoroughfare between St. Helena Road and Silwood Street, which road is Corbetts Lane, The Yestry Resolved—That the whole length of the roadway leading from opposite the "Crystal Tavern" P.H. to the "jolly Gardeners" P.H., part of which is known as "St. Helena Road" and the remainder as "Corbett's Lane," be renamed "Corbett's Lane" only, that the name of St. Helena Road be abolished, and that the Clerk apply to the London County Council for the necessary renaming order. And on 27th November, 1894, a letter was received from the Superintending Architect to the London County Council with reference to the Yestry's application, suggesting that St. Helena Road be extended to Silwood Street and the houses renumbered, and that the further piece of Corbett's Lane be renumbered, and the subsidiary names abolished, and asking the Vestry's opinion thereon. The Vestry Resolved to adopt the suggestion of the Superintending Architect. The Vestry, on 20th November, 1894, in response to a petition signed by residents in Orange Place, Resolved to make an application to the London County Council to alter the name of the Place to "Orange Terrace." This was done, but the matter had not been dealt with by the Council at the close of the year. 72 Public Health (London) Act, 1891. A letter having been received from the Clerk to the School Board for London, drawing attention to section 55 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and stating that a difficulty had arisen by the teachers not knowing when they might safely re-admit children from a house where a case of infectious disease had occurred, and suggesting that an uniform system should be adopted throughout the Metropolis, whereby the Medical Officers of Health would grant to the parents a certificate stating that the premises in which the disease occurred had been disinfected, which certificate would be handed to the head teachers, who would thus have some guarantee that they might re-admit excluded children to school, and asking that this Yestry would give such directions as would ensure such a certificate being given in all cases when the disinfection of the premises had been completed ; It was Resolved—That the Medical Officer of Health be instructed to prepare and issue to every head teacher in the parish a circular letter, stating that in future no child who had been notified as living in an infected house should be permitted to return until the time stated on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health had fully expired, and that no certificate should be valid and accepted unless issued by him. On 12th March, 1895, the Vestry Resolved to purchase No. 15, Cathay Street, to be used as a temporary shelter under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The subject of the provision of public street conveniences having been under consideration of a Committee of the Vestry, The Vestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, to approach the Vestry of Bermondsey with the view of their joining this Vestry in the expense of the construction and maintenance of an underground convenience for men and women on the old Mill Pond site, in lieu of the present urinal in Southwark Park Road, near the "Queen Charlotte" P.H., and the following gentlemen were appointed as delegates from this 78 Yestry to wait upon the Bermondsey Vestry in support thereof, and the Clerk was instructed to write to the Vestry of Bermondsey, asking them to receive such Deputation : Messrs. Bisley, Vice-Chairman, Messrs. Beasley, F. T. Talbot, J. Brown and Stuart, Mullenger. Moss, The matter had not proceeded further at the close of the year. A letter was received from the Vestry of St. Marylebone, forwarding copy communication addressed by them to the Local Government Board, with reference to the cleansing of footways under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, after a fall of snow, by the Sanitary Authority, urging upon the Board to initiate legislation with the view to the reimposition of that particular work upon the occupiers and owners of the several frontages, but the Vestry being of opinion that that duty was very properly thrown upon the shoulders of the local authority under the Act—Resolved to take no action in the matter. A letter was received from the Hon. Secretary of the British Institute of Public Health re London Congress, 1894, asking the Vestry to appoint delegates from among the Members and Officers to attend the Congress. The Vestry Resolved that Messrs. F. T. Talbot and R. L. Stuart, and the Surveyor, Medical Officer of Health, and Chief Sanitary Inspector attend on behalf of the Vestry. The following is a copy of the resolutions passed thereat:— "That, while the necessary provision of Block Dwellings for the Housing of the Working Classes is being pushed forward within the Metropolis and other large towns, it is desirable that every effort should also be made to increase the number of Cottage Dwellings in the most accessible suburbs of London and other large towns, especially in connection with the railway systems. "That this Conference instructs the Executive of the British Institute of Public Health to press upon the Government the necessity of making it compulsory 74 on all Local Authorities to provide adequate and suitable Hospital Accommodation for Infectious Diseases, including powers for compulsorily acquiring land. "That, in the opinion of this Congress, the Local Government Board is not justified in affording owners and occupiers of land in the vicinity of a site proposed to be purchased by a Public Authority for infectious hospital purposes, any protection beyond that given them by tbe action of the general law. That Municipal Authorities should be empowered to establish and maintain Winter Gardens, with wholesome entertainments for the people. That the Preventive Medicine Section of the Congress of the British Institute of Public Health, now sitting in London, would suggest to the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board the advantage that would accrue to the Public Health if his Department would collect and publish the salient points bearing upon the proof of the preventibility of Consumption and Tubercular diseases generally (i.e.—a summary of our present knowledge of the causation of these diseases), together with practical suggestions as to the details of precautionary measures to be observed by individuals, or to be adopted by public bodies; and if such facts and recommendations were disseminated as widely as possible. That, in the opinion of this joint Conference of the Chemical and Municipal and Parliamentary Sections of the British Institute of Public Health, amendment of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is required in the following, among other, directions:— "(1).—The modification of the Warranty Defence in such a way as to ensure the punishment of the real offender. "(2).—The appointment of some adequate official scientific authority for the fixing of milk and other standards, and the investigation of analytical methods. 75 (3). The registration of itinerant vendors, and further provision for sampling goods in transit. “(4.) requirement of clear and legible Labelling of Mixtures and Impoverished Goods. “(5).—The clear inclusion in the term "Food" of such articles as Baking Powders, which, under the law as at present construed, may be so made and sold as to injure the health of the public. That the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the various County Councils have their attention called to the importance to the public of the early recognition and accurate diagnosis of Diphtheria, and that they be asked to afford medical men facilities for obtaining such bacteriological assistance as may lead to the prompt recognition of the disease. That Municipal Authorities should be empowered to establish and maintain Crematoria. That Testators should be empowered to direct how their bodies are to be disposed of, and executors be compelled to observe such directions. That it is desirable in the interests of Public Health that the present permissive action provided in the Public Health Act, 1875, to construct Public Slaughter Houses be made compulsory, and that after the building of such houses notice be given to owners of all Private Slaughter Houses that at the expiration of two or three years no further slaughtering can be permitted in any but Public Slaughter Houses. That it is desirable that a representation be made to Government that the costs incurred in Port Sanitary Work, in seeking to protect the country from the invasion of Cholera should be paid in whole or in part by the State. 76 Equalisation of Rates Act, 1894. This Act was passed on the 25th August, 1894, and provides that the London County Council shall in every year form a fund, called the Equalisation Fund, equal to a rate of 6d. in the £, upon the rateable value of London, according to the Valuation lists as they stand on the 6th April in that year, and shall half-yearly determine the contribution from each Parish in London to one-half of the Equalisation Fund, and the grant due from that one-half of the Fund to each Parish by apportioning the amount of half the Equalisation Fund among the Parishes in proportion to their rateable value according to the said Valuation lists, and by apportioning the amount of half the Equalisation Fund among the Sanitary Districts in proportion to their population; and where a Sanitary District comprises two or more Parishes, by dividing that grant among those Parishes in proportion to their population, with this exception,—that where the aggregate of the contributions from the Parishes in the District is less than the grant apportioned to the District, the difference shall be paid out of the Equalisation Fund to the Sanitary Authority of the District, and no payment towards any equalisation charge shall be required from any Parish in the District. Subject as aforesaid where the contribution from a Parish is less than the grant due, the difference shall be paid out of the Equalisation Fund to the Sanitary Authority of the District forming or comprising the Parish, but if it exceeds the grant due to the Parish, the Council shall for the spacial purpose of meeting the excess, levy on the Parish a County contribution (called the Equalisation Charge) as a separate item of the County rate. Every sum paid to a Sanitary Authority is to be applied in defraying the expensed incurred under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and so far as not required for that purpose, those incurred in respect of lighting, and so far as not required for that purpose, those incurred in respect of streets, and every Sanitary Authority to whom a sum is paid in any year, shall within the prescribed time render to the Local Government Board a true account in the prescribed form, showing for the twelve months preceding the said day the total 77 amount of the sum so paid, and the total amount of the expenses incurred by the Authority under each of the following heads:— (a) Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891., (b) In respect of Lighting, and (c) In respect of Streets; and showing the amount expended in respect of each head, out of the sums paid to such Authority under the Act. The Yestry benefit to the extent of about 3d. in the £, and received for the half-year to Lady-day, 1895, the sum of £1083 16s. 3d. Before the Act was passed, the Bill came before the Yestry for consideration, and a resolution was passed in its favour. 78 Local Government Act, 1894. A Special Committee of the Vestry having had under their consideration a letter from the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkemvell, forwarding copy of a resolution passed by that Yestry, as under:— “That, in the opinion of the Vestry, the Vestry Clerks of the several Metropolitan Parishes, or, in the case of groups of parishes under the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Clerks to the District Boards, by their peculiar and intimate knowledge of the registration and other features of their respective areas, are exceptionally qualified to fill the position of Returning Officer at Vestry Elections, under the Local Government Act, 1894, and that this opinion be communicated to the Local Government Board for their consideration in connection with the framing of rules relating to Elections under the Act ”— Recommended—That a similar resolution be passed by the Vestry, and a copy thereof forwarded to the Local Government Board. This was adopted by the Vestry. The Vestry also had before them a letter from the Yestry of Bermondsey, forwarding copy resolution passed by that Board, as under, and asking this Yestry to take similar action:— “That this Vestry expresses the opinion that Saturday is the day which affords the fullest opportunity for the greatest number of voters to poll, and earnestly requests the Local Government Board to fix that day as the day for taking the poll at the forthcoming local Elections in the Metropolis.” The letter was referred to a Committee for consideration and report, which Committee Recommended—That the Clerk be instructed to write, in reply, stating that this Vestry cannot agree with the resolution passed by the Vestry of Bermondsey in favour of Saturday being the day appointed for taking the poll at the forthcoming local Elections in the Metropolis, as they are of opinion that that day would be most inconvenient, and would recommend either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. 79 An amendment was moved by Mr. Chambers, and seconded by Mr. Bellsham—That this Vestry support the Vestry of Bermondsey in their endeavour to secure Saturday as the appointed day for Vestry Elections in the Metropolis. The amendment was put and lost. The original motion was put and carried, and it was Resolved accordingly.

(a) One opening, being at or near the level of the surface of the ground, communicating with the drains by means of a suitable pipe, shaft, or disconnecting chamber, as near as practicable to the trap, which shall be provided between the main drain of the building and the sewer with which such drain communicates ; such opening shall be situate on that side of the trap nearer the building. (b) The second opening shall be obtained by carrying up from the point or head of the drains farthest distant from the first mentioned opening, an iron ventilating pipe not less than three inches internal diameter, fitted with perfectly tight joints and wire guard covering at top, carried up to such a height and in such a manner as effectually to prevent any escape of foul air from such pipe or shaft into any building in the vicinity thereof. 13. A suitable trap to be provided in every main drain which directly communicates with the sewer at a point as distant as may be practicable from the building, within the curtilage thereof, and as near as may be practicable to the point at which such drain may be connected with the sewer. Unless absolutely unavoidable, no disconnecting syphon or shaft covering can be permitted in the footway of any street. 14. Immediately above the disconnecting trap a suitable inspection chamber shall be constructed, provided with air-tight cover. 15. Junctions of branch drains shall in no case be made at right angles, but with proper junction pipes, having the branch pipe formed on them at an angle of 45 to 60 degrees, with the main drain in the direction of the flow; no cutting of pipes will be sanctioned, and no vertical right angle junction will be allowed except as inspection shafts, or for ventilation purposes. 88 16. Rain water pipes, bath wastes, and all wastes from sinks, hydraulic lifts or other business appliances shall deliver outside the building on to open trapped gullies, or if they must of necessity be within the building, on to special interceptors approved by the Vestry, which must in every case be connected to the drains, and all inlets to the drains shall be properly trapped except those inlets used for the purpose of ventilation. The waste pipes should be protected by a syphon or other suitable trap to prevent a current of air passing through the pipe into the interior of the house. "Bell" traps will on no account be allowed. 17. Soil pipes placed vertically shall be of cast iron, not less than j in. thick, coated inside and outside with Dr. Angus Smith's patent varnish and jointed with molten lead and gaskin, or of drawn lead, weighing not less than seven lbs. per square foot. They shall be of an internal diameter of 4 in. and placed outside the house or building, and in every case extended full bore up to and above the eaves, finished with wire guard covering, at such a height as effectually to prevent any escape of foul air into any building in the vicinity thereof. Soil pipes are not to be used as rain water pipes. 18. The principle of construction of all water-closets is subject to the approval of the Vestry. "D" traps, containers, receivers, and hopper-shaped pans cannot be permitted. Where a series of water closets are placed one above the other, delivering into a common soil pipe, the traps of each closet basin must be specially ventilated to prevent syphonage, by means of a two-inch lead pipe turned into the main ventilation pipe at a point above the highest water-closet connected with such soil pipe. Great care must be taken that the connection between the water closet apparatus and the syphon and the joint of the syphon with the drain or soil pipe are both made sound and air and water tight, and with such materials as are not likely to contract or expand or be affected by the urine passing over them into the drain or soil pipe. 19. No rain water will be allowed to deliver on to the footways ; water from the roofs, bay windows, cornices, &c., must be taken into the system of house drainage, or it may with the consent of the Vestry, be passed into the street channel by means of cast-iron gutter pipes of an approved pattern laid across, and with their top side level with the pavement of the footway. 89 20. Overflow pipes from all cisterns, service boxes, "safes," &c., must discharge, if practicable, direct into the open air, or be carried by means of lead or other suitable pipes to a proper trapped gulley or syphon. 21. The whole of any system of drainage must be approved by the Surveyor before a single pipe is covered up, and the joints tested by charging with water or other means should the Surveyor so direct.

Fire Alarms. A Fire Alarm has been placed in London Street by the London County Council, in connection with the Fire Brigade Station, Evelyn Street, Deptford. 101 Miscellaneous. The Vestry had before them a letter from the London County Council enclosing copy of report from the Local Government and Taxation Committee of the Council on the question whether there were any general By-laws for the good rule and government of London which the Council might be advised to make, apart from the By-laws dealing with special subjects made under special Acts of Parliament, and asking the Vestry to favour the Council with any suggestions as to subjects on which it might seem to them that By-laws might usefully be made by the Council; and Resolved—That the Clerk be authorised to write in reply, stating that in the opinion of the Vestry it is advisable that a By-law should be framed prohibiting the throwing of orange peel on the footways, and also that a By-law should be framed to obviate as much as possible noises in the streets after 12 o'clock at night, and that in the meantime posters be printed and circulated in the parish cautioning persons against throwing orange peel on the footways. A communication having been received from the Vestry Clerk of Fulham, forwarding copy of a Petition presented by that Vestry to the Local Government Board, praying the Board to promote a Bill or Bills in Parliament for the purpose of preventing the arbitrary cutting off of the water supply from inhabited dwellings, and asking this Vestry to support such action, it was Resolved—That this Vestry support the Vestry of Fulham in the action taken by them. on the 20th June, 1894, a letter was received from the London County Council stating that the Council had thought it desirable to convene a Conference with a view to considering whether means could be adopted to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by vagrants ; that such Conference would take place at the County Hall, on Thursday, the 19th July next, and inviting this Vestry to appoint two delegates, with the Medical Officer of Health, to attend and take part in the discussion. Resolved—That Mr. Chambers and the Medical Officer of Health attend on behalf of the Vestry, and the following is a copy of the resolutions passed thereat.- "l.—That common shelters which are not subject to the law relating to common lodging-houses should be made subject to such law. 102 "2.—That there should be power to the local authority to require medical examination of all persons entering common lodging-houses and casual wards, and that each inmate of a common lodging-house or casual ward should, on admission, have a hath of fresh water. "3.—That the local authority should have power to order the keeper of a common lodging-house in which there has been infectious disease, to refuse fresh admissions for such time as may be required by the authority. "4.—That the local authority should be empowered to require the temporary closing of any common lodging-house in which infectious disease has occurred. "5.—That the local sanitary authorities should have power to require the detention of any inmate of a common lodging-house or casual ward who may reasonably be suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. "6.—That means should be provided for the detention and isolation of any vagrant found wandering in a public place, if reasonably suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. "7.—That the local authority should have full power to require the disinfection of the person and clothes of any person in a common lodging-house or casual ward, whether infected or exposed to infection. "8.—That arrangements should be made by which the occurrence of infectious disease in common lodging-houses or casual wards should be made known by the local authority of the district to the local authorities of other districts. "9.—That local authorities should be empowered to require the vaccination or revaccination of persons in common lodging-houses or casual wards who are exposed to the infection of smallpox. The above resolutions came under the consideration of a Committee of the Vestry, but no action was taken thereon. The piece of vacant ground adjoining Trinity Boys' School, Rotherhithe Street, having been for some long time since a nuisance, and the Vestry having made futile efforts to find the owner or owners, resolved, on 18th December, 1894, to fence in the piece of vacant ground 103 in question and to construct a gateway entrance to the school in such fence for the ingress and egress of scholars of the said school. The strip of land between the pavement and fence walls of Nos. 79 and 81, Lower Road, has been taken over by the Vestry by consent of the Gomm Estate and paved. Staff. Mr. Neptune Frederick Baker was elected to the office of Clerk in the Surveyor's department on the 3rd April, 1894, at a salary of £1 per week. Mr. J. J. Chapman, Foreman Pavior, resigned his position on 30th March, 1894, left the service of the Vestry on 14th April, 1894, and was granted a testimonial under the Common Seal of the Vestry. The Vestry Resolved to fill up the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Chapman, and also that the list of duties appertaining to the post should comprise the duties relating to the superintendence of the scavenging and repair of macadam roads, etc., and that such list be printed in the By-laws of the Vestry. Advertisements were issued inviting applications for the post, and a Special Committee Meeting held to open applications and to make a selection therefrom. On 5th June, 1894, Mr. Thomas Baron was elected to the post of Foreman to the Vestry at a salary of 50/- per week. The salary of Mr. Reuben J.Walker, Junior Assistant in the Clerk's department, has been increased from £65 to £75 per annum, as and from the 25th March, 1894. Mr. W. Kitchen, Road Foreman, and Mr. J. E. Poole, Clerk of Works, having been unable, through illness, to perform their duties for some time, the matter, together with the re-organisation of the Sewer Staff, were referred to a Committee for consideration and report And on 5th February, 1895, the Committee reported as under:- " Mr. Kitchen, who is now over 69 years of age, has been in the employ of the Vestry since the 1st February, 1867 (a period of 28 years), and although there 104 has never been any direct appointment of Mr. Kitchen as Road Foreman, he has nevertheless performed the duties of that office since the year 1870, upon the resignation of one Philip Rogers; that his wages started at 24/- per week, and having been since increased on four different occasions, now amount to 36/per week; that he has been unable to perform his duties through illness since June of last year, during which time he has been in receipt of his full wages, that from a Certificate of the London Hospital, it appears he is suffering from Diabetes Millitus, and we are of opinion that he will never recover sufficiently to efficiently discharge the duties appertaining to the office of Road Foreman; " and Recommended—That in view of Mr. Kitchen's long and faithful service, extending over a period of 28 years, he retire from the service of the Vestry on a superannuation allowance of £1 per week. This was adopted by the Vestry. "Mr. Poole, who is now 54 years of age, was appointed Clerk of Works at 42s. per week, on the 11th April, 1876, a period of nearly 19 years, and his wages now amount to £3 per week, having been increased on four separate occasions, that he has been unable to perform his duties through illness, since August of last year, during which time he has been in receipt of his full wages; that from a certificate of Dr. Brookhouse, it appears he is suffering from Hemoplysis; that Dr. Shaw, the Vestry's Medical Officer of Health, reports that his condition is most unsatisfactory, that he has had an attack of spitting blood which has reduced him considerably, and that in his opinion he will not be again able to perform the duties required of him as Clerk of Works ;" and Recommended—That for the present Mr. Poole be paid half rate of wages, viz., 30/per week, and that the further consideration of the matter be deferred. This was adopted by the Vestry. Mr. Poole died on 18th February, 1895. The Vestry passed a resolution condoling with his widow and family and also granted her a donation of £30.

At the meeting of the Vestry on the 22nd May, 1804, attention was drawn to the death of Mr. Lawrence Stevens, one of the Rotherhithe representatives on the London County Council, when it was Resolved—That a letter of condolence be sent from this Vestry to the widow and family of the deceased. On the 19th February, 1895, a letter was submitted to the Vestry from Mr. R. H. Clarke, conveying the news of the decease of his father, Mr. Thomas Wm. Clarke, on the 10th. The Vestry Resolved to forward a letter of condolence to the family of the late Mr. Clarke, in the loss they had sustained through his death. The death occurred on the 7th March, 1895, of Mr. Churchwarden Wigginton, a member of the Vestry and a Commissioner of the Public Libraries in the Parish. Mr. James Wigginton was greatly esteemed by all who knew him, and his funeral which took place on 14th March, 1895, was attended by a great number of people, amongst whom were the whole of the Members of the Vestry, Overseers, Officials, etc., and at the meeting of the Vestry held on the 19th March, 1895, a resolution was passed, expressing the deep regret felt by the Vestry in his loss, and condoling with his widow and family. 107 VESTRYMEN OF THE PARISH OIF ROTHERHITHE, LONDON, Under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. 1893-4.

To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of Rotherhithe— Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report upon the work of my Department for the year ending 25th March, 1895. Licenses. Fifty-four Licenses were granted to erect scaffolds and hoardings on the public footpaths and carriageways for new buildings, alterations or repairs. Roads and Footways. The lengths of the roads in the Parish at the present time are as under Macadam 9 miles. Pitching 4.85 „ Tar Macadam .15 „ Pebbles .12 „ Flagging .47 „ Total 14.59 or 14½ miles. 112 In addition to the general repairs the following special works have been completed. The footways have been relaid in Silverlock Street, Westlake Road, Oldfield Road, Chilton Street (south-side), Seth Street, Dilston Grove, Odessa Street, Rotherhithe New Road (Credon Road to boundary), Commercial Dock Passage (part), Aspinden Road (north-side), and Rotherhithe Wall (part). Lower Road.— The whole of the footway upon the west-side, from Orange Place to Union Road, has been repaved with Victoria stone, the kerb redressed and relaid upon cement concrete. It was only intended at first to carry this improvement to Wells' Tenements, but a great portion of the existing Old York flagging having been disturbed by the Gas and Water Companies, the Vestry, in my opinion, very wisely continued the work to Union Road, and they were recouped by the Companies the cost of the relaying the portions disturbed. Thetford Place, Irwell Place.— These roads and footways have been entirely reconstructed : a New York kerb and three-course granite channel upon cement concrete being laid, the flagging of the footways redressed, squared and relaid, new stones being substituted as required, and the roadway formed with 4 inches of tar macadam upon a foundation of 6 inches of hard core. Lovat Place.— The footways in Lovat Place have been relaid, the kerb reset, and the stones of the roadway redressed and relaid upon a foundation of cement concrete. Rotherhithe Street.—(Globe to Lavender). The paving of this roadway has been relaid with redressed granite setts laid on 9 inches of cement concrete, the existing kerb redressed and relaid, and the footways have been relaid, the flags redressed and squared. Rotherhithe Street.—(Opposite Tunnel Mills). Owing to building operations necessitating an extension of the roadway, the whole area from Church Stairs has been relaid with redressed granite setts laid on cement concrete, the kerb and footways being relaid. 113 At the request of, and at the expense of the Owners, the footway upon the north side was set back so as to allow of a nearer approach of vehicles to the mills, the amouut charged being £53 10s. 2d. Adams Gardens.—The existing granite paving has been redressed and relaid upon G inches of cement concrete, and the remainder of the roadway constructed in macadam upon a foundation of hard core with three-course granite channel on either side. The footways have been relaid and a New York kerb provided where necessary. Orange Place.—In accordance with a resolution of the Vestry apportionment notices were served upon the Owners of property in this street, and the amounts having been paid the footways have been flagged with Victoria stone. The existing kerb has been redressed and relaid, and new three-course granite channels have been constructed on either side of the road upon a foundation of cement concrete, at the expense of the Vestry. Removal of Slop. 7262½ cubic yards of slop have been removed from the streets of the Pariah by Mr. Donogen, the cost amounting to £1543 5s. 7d. In the various works throughout the Parish, executed by our own workmen, the following materials have been used:— Broken Guernsey Granite 927 tons Thames Ballast 2033 c. yards ,, Sand 65 „ Stone Lime 36 „ Blue Lias Lime 12 tons Portland Cement 286 „ 3-in. York Flags 2115 square feet Victoria Stone 11750 4-in. by 7-in. Guernsey Setts 255 tons 6-in. by 12-in. ,, Kerb 331 feet lin. 3-in. by 10-in. York Kerb 1107 „ Stock Bricks 11475 114 Snow Storms. Snowstorms occurred from the 13th January to the 4th February The following table will give particulars of the expenses incurred for labour in clearing the streets:— TABLE OF LABOUR.

The total cost of the Snow removal in labour, cartage and disposal amounted to £523 16s. 5d. By carting Snow to the Depot, at Bull Head Dock, a saving of £142 6s. 3d. was effected. 115 Unemployed. On December 20th, 1894, the register of the unemployed, who applied at the Vestry's Depot, was taken and remained open until 16th March, 1835. 700 names were registered and 1,937 days' work given, at a cost of £426 6s. 6d. The amount includes the extra labour engaged cleansing the streets after the snow storms. Sewers. The following lengths of Pipe Sewers have been constructed during the year : 130 feet 12 inch pipe . Rotherhithe Street, 85 ,, 9 ,, . Lavender Lane, 157 ,, 9 ,, . Odessa Street, 113 ,, 9 ,, . Randalls Rents, 270 ,, 15 ,, . N. side Albion Street (reconstruction way Avenue to Swan Lane), 33 ,, 9 ,, . Hatteraick Street. Total 788 feet They are laid in straight lines, between the points of inspection, to uniform gradients, laid on and surrounded with cement concrete. Flushing Shafts have been provided at the heads of all drains. During the past twelve months an one-horse van and two men were employed flushing the sewers upon 193 days. A great difficulty is experienced in flushing some of the sewers, as the only means of access is through a house near the top, the operation of taking a hose pipe through the same, causing great inconvenience to the occupant, and the effect of the flush is greatly diminished owing to the decreased velocity of the water caused by it passing through a long length of hose pipe. Gullies. The gullies in the Parish now number 809, and a systematic clearing of the same has been undertaken during the past twelve months. 768 cubic yards of slush have been removed during the year. 116 The brick gulley pits have, after a slight period of drought, to be filled up with water owing to the porosity of their brickwork, and during the summer months a disinfectant was mixed with the water. In all cases where it has been necessary to insert additional, or to re-construct the old gullies, I have put in double trapped cast-iron ones, the inner sludge box of which is emptied weekly by the sweepers, thus preventing any smell or accumulation of deposit. Sixteen new gullies have been put in as follows:— Irwell Place 4 Randalls Rents . 1 Thetford Place . 2 Orange Place 2 Clarks Orchard . 2 Adams Gardens 2 Church Passage. 1 Hatteraick Street 2 Gullies in the following streets have been found with broken traps and have had new stoneware ones inserted, surrounded with concrete:— Parfitt Road 1 Albion Street 4 Cranham Road 2 Cow Lane 1 Trident Street 1 Lower Road 2 Clarence Street 1 Silver Street 1 13 Drainage Works. One hundred and sixty-one notices have been received in reference to the redrainage of houses, erection of new houses, &c., as follows:— 117 Existing houses redrained 219 Buildings and premises other than houses drained 11 New houses erected and drained 6 Additions or alterations to houses 28 Other Buildings 6 House drains cleansed 17 287 In connection with the above, 88 new connections have been made with the sewers, of this number fourteen were connected to the County Council's mains. The cost charged to the owners for the connections and for the necessary interceptor and inspection chamber under the footway where no forecourt existed, amounted to £429 5s. Previous to the commencement of the street watering, the whole of the wells and pumps, numbering eleven, were overhauled and repaired at a cost of £23 4s. 10d., and the cost of the maintenance of the pumps during the year, after repair, amounted to £10 13s. 9d. The Vestry possess seven vans and two carts; the whole were thoroughly repaired by Messrs. Oakley & Son, at a cost of £49 12s. 6d. The carts are intended for sewer flushing purposes, but I am compelled, to the detriment of the sewers and gullies, to utilise one of them for water purposes during the warm weather. Street Watering. 429j liorseB were hired for the watering, and I estimate the quantity of water pumped at 3,022,000 gallons. The cost of the street watering amounted to £329 8s. Id., and is divided as follows £ S. a. Horse hire and drivers 214 12 0 Labour (pumpers) . . ••• 114 15 7 £329 8 1 118 To efficiently water the whole of the streets in the Parish during the very warm weather it is in my opinion necessary that two additional vans be obtained. Urinals. The Public Urinals in the Parish now number nine ; two additional ones were fixed during the past year. The situation and accommodation is as follows:— SITUATION. STALLS. Near Derrick Street 4 Globe Street 2 Lavender Bridge 2 "Half-way House," Rotherhithe New Road 2 C/o Hawkstone Road 5 "Red Lion" (rear of) 5 Neptune Street 4 Opposite "Royal Oak," Lower Road 6 Railway Avenue 6 In addition to the above, two six-stall urinals are maintained in Southwark Park Road by the Vestry of Bermondsey at the joint expense of the two Vestries. To ensure a more uniform consumption of water consistent with the accommodation, a regulation tap with bye pass for flushing purposes has been fixed on the supply pipe of each urinal which will, I am sure, considerably economise the water. The following urinals attached to public-houses are cleansed by the urinal man; they are open to the roadway and accessible to the general public "Dover Castle," Rotherhithe Street "Royal George," Union Road "Britannia," Neptune Street "Prince of Orange," Lower Road 119 "Warrior," Lower Road " Commercial Dock Tavern," Plough Road " Ship York " Rotherhithe Street " Ship and Whale," Derrick Street " White Horse," Rotherhithe Street " Horns," Rotherhithe Street " Noah's Ark," Rotherhithe Street Beerhouse, Kenning Street, Swan Lane Lighting. At the commencement of the year the Public Lamps in the Parish numbered as follows:— Ordinary Street Lamps . 484 Sugg's Patent Lamps . 4 10-feet per hour Lamps . 2 Large Lanterns 4 494 Four additional lamps have been erected during the year in the following places:— Neptune Court 1 King's Stairs 1 Railway Avenue (urinal) 1 Adams Gardens 1 Total 498 Repair of Trenches. From and after the 1st May of last year the repairs to the various trenches, opened In the Companies under the powers of their respective Acts of Parliament, have been executed by the employees of the Vestry. 120 The following table shows the area disturbed and the amounts received for their repair:— Measurements.

Thirty-three cast iron name plates with raised letters have been fixed at a cost of £7 5s. This kind of name plate is an improvement on any previously fixed in the parish, as it cannot be damaged by mischievous boys throwing missiles at it. Tree Guards. Eighteen new Tree Guards have been fixed around the trees upon the Mill Pond site, and along the Southwark Park Road. A further number should be renewed during the current year, so as to gradually abolish the defective and badly constructed guards. 121 Inventory of Plant, Materials and Tools In the various yards. 25th March, 1895.

To the Chairman and Members of the Rotherhithe Vestry— Gentlemen, I have the honour herewith to present to you my First Annual Report of the work done during the year ending 31st December, 1894, in connection with the Sanitary Department of the Yestry. Smoke Nuisances. The following is a list of infringements of the 24th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (Smoke consumption), as reported to the Yestry during the year. Mr. Dennis, 246, Eotherhithe New Road: Mr. Arnold, 16, Ilderton Road, no recurrence. Messrs. Enthoven & Son, Upper Ordnance Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, and Messrs. Quirk, Barton & Co., Normandy Wharf, Rotherhithe Street; in each of these cases no recurrence of the nuisance occurred after service of Notice to abate the same. With reference to complaint against Messrs. Burt, Boulton & Haywood, of Barnard's Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, observation was kept of the premises, but no nuisance could be detected. Fire, King and Queen Granaries. The above premises were visited with respect to a number of Boxes of Dates which had been damaged by the fire which occurred on the 25th February. Notice was served upon the Salvage Officer in charge, stating that the said dates must not be removed without permission of the Yestry ; an undertaking was given by the Contractor to the Salvage Corportion, that the dates in question would be destroyed, which was subsequently done. 112 Complaint having been made of offensive smells arising from a quantity of wool on the above premises which had been damaged by the fire. On service of Notice upon the Brokers of the Insurance Corporation, the said wool was removed and the Nuisance abated. Trade Nuisances. Complaint was received of Nuisance caused by the dressing of Roker Skins at 26, Fulford Street, which was referred to the London County Council, who informed the Vestry that the same did not come under the Regulations of the Council. Complaint was received of noxious smells arising from the premises of Messrs. Blumann & Stern, Oil Refiners, Odessa Street. On inspection of the premises no nuisance was found to exist and no further complaint has been made with regard thereto. The premises of Mr. J. Judd, Senr., Manure Manufacturer of L.B. & S.C. Railway Arches, Rotherhithe New Road, have been a source of nuisance during the year and require continual watching. A Nuisance was occasioned at Messrs. "Wincklers' premises, Trinity "Wharf, Rotherhithe Street by the process of grain drying, and the allowing of offensive matter to flow into the public street, contrary to the Vestry's Bye-laws for prevention of Nuisances. On service of Notice the Nuisance was abated. Several letters were written to the owners of Fish Offal collecting vans, calling attention to their vans being in the parish after the hours specified in the London County Council's Bye-laws, and informing them that should such occur again proceedings would betaken against them for infringing the said By-laws. Dusting. During the year the Dusting Contract Las been carried ont without any complaint being received of neglect on the part of the Contractor, which I believe to be mainly due to the careful supervision of the Dust Inspector. 143 Dust Pails. 250 Dust Pails were ordered of and supplied by Mr. P. Round of Lye, near Stourbridge, at a cost of £24. Lake, Southwark Park. Attention having been called to the condition of the Lake in Southwark Park, the matter was referred to the London County Council, who promised to give same their attention. Mansion House Council Complaints. Complaints in respect to Sanitary defects at the following premises were received from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor :— 24, Fulford street, 34, Dilston Grove, 124a, Lower Road, 126a, Lower Road, 128, Lower Road. Notices were served upon the Owners thereof and the nuisance in each case was abated. Baker's Rents, These premises, which had been closed some years, having been found in a dangerous and dilapidated condition, the matter was reported to the London County Council, who demolished the said premises as dangerous structures. 1 to 5, Gooch Place. On inspection, the above premises were found to be in such a bad sanitary condition that they were referred to the Medical Officer of Health to deal with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 144 National Schools, Lower Road. Complaint having been received with reference to the above schools, on inspection certain sanitary defects were found to exist, and the following suggestions to remedy the same were carried out, viz :— (1) The trough Closets to be more frequently flushed. (2) The Urinals to be supplied with water. (3) New pan to the Master's W.C. (4) The water for drinking purposes drawn direct from the main. Swan Lane Buildings. On inspection the above buildings were found to be in a very dirty condition, water closets and pans dirty and in several cases the rooms were overcrowded ; upon service of Notices the nuisance was abated. A sphyxia tor. An Asphyxiator has been provided for testing drains with smoke, at a cost of £7 10s. Keeping Swine in unfit Places. Complaints having been received of keeping Swine at the following premises:— Stables, Seven Step Alley; Stables, Eotherhithe New Eoad; and Stables, St. Helena Eoad, contrary to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, notices were served upon the occupiers of the respective premises, and in each case the nuisance was abated forthwith. Infectious Disease• Two cases of wilful exposure while suffering from an infectious disease occurred during the year, contrary to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In each case the Clerk was instructed to write to the offenders, cautioning them against committing such offence in future. 145 The Vestry having considered as to the cleansing of rooms after infectious disease: Resolved that the matter be left in the hands of the Chief Sanitary Inspector to engage temporary assistance as required. Cow-houses. The Cow-houses and one Slaughter-house have been duly inspected, and with two exceptions were found to be in a satisfactory condition. Bake-houses. Complaint having been received from Her Majesty's Superintending Inspector of Workshops, calling attention to the dirty condition of two Bake-houses in the parish, and upon inspection, the occupiers undertook to cleanse same forthwith, which was duly carried out. Regulations made under the Factory and Workshops Acts of 1878 and 1883, relative to the cleanliness of Bake-houses, were submitted to the Yestry, and it was Resolved that the said Regulations be approved and printed copies thereof be furnished to the bakers throughout the parish. I attended the conference convened by the Vestry of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, re the amendment of the law relating to Bake-houses, when the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— 1. That the present state of the law relating to Bake-houses requires amendment by the addition of the following clauses to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (a) • That uniform Metropolitan Bye-laws regulating Bake-houses be made by the London County Council, and be confirmed by the Local Government Board, and that the duty of enforcing these Bye-laws shall devolve upon the various Local Sanitary Authorities. 146 (b) That the portions of the By-laws regulating the structure of Bake-houses do not apply to existing Bakeries. (c) That the London County Council be empowered to frame By-laws for the construction of underground Bake-houses, and that all Bake-houses erected after the passing of such By-laws shall conform thereto. The Bake-houses throughout the parish were inspected twice during the year. Drainage, Raymouth Road. The drains of Nos. 77 to 91, Raymouth Road, having been tested by the water test, and found to be very defective; notices were ordered to be served on the owner to carry out the necessary works to remedy same, but owing to the owner contending that the combined drainage was a sewer the matter remained unsettled at the close of the year. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the year 19 samples of milk, and 1 of pepper were submitted to the public Analyst, and convictions were obtained in four cases of Adulteration, the Fines and Costs amounting to £7 8s. 6d.
