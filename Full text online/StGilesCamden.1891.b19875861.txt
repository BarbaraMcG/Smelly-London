The year 1891-1892 has been one of considerable importance to the Metropolis, or as it is now more properly designated, the county of London, the coming into operation of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, having caused very considerable changes in the law relating to those matters. The year also witnessed the election of the second County Council for the administrative county of London, and so far as the division of which the St. Giles District forms part was concerned, resulted in the return of Messrs. A. C. Ranyard and J. F. Remnant in place of Messrs. Alfred Hoare and T. W. Maule, the latter of whom did not seek re-election. The measure which has been so long promised for dealing with the subject of district councils has not yet been introduced into either of the Houses of Parliament, and having regard to the legislative programme for the present session, there seems little likelihood of the consideration of GENERAL REPORT. The Past Tear. 9 such an important measure being entered upon during the existence of the present Parliament. A very large amount of business has engaged the attention of the Board and its various Committees, and an immense amount of routine work has been got through. The follow ing pages of this Report deal with some of the more important matters, but it must not be imagined that they contain a complete record of the year's proceedings. During the year under review 113 Meetings of the Board and its Committees have taken place. The following are the particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 29 Special 8 Total — 37 Committee Meetings- Finance 22 Law and Parliamentary 7 Sanitary 14 Special 6 Works 27 Total — 76 Making in all a Total of 113 This list again shows an increase in the number of meetings held, and the remarks that have been made on previous recent occasions as to the length of time occupied are also applicable to the present instance. Changes in the Personnel of the Board, During the year several gentlemen have ceased to be members of the Board, and have been replaced by other 10 ratepayers. Messrs. John Henry Burlingson and Thomas Davies have died. Lieutenant-Colonel Edward James Gardener, Mr. Benjamin Bennett, and Mr. Felix Weiss have resigned. Mr. Burlingson and Mr. Davies were both active members of the Board and its Committees. The resignation of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Weiss were in consequence of their having left the District, while Lieutenant-Colonel Gardener resigned his seat. The vacancies caused by these deaths and resignations were all filled up. The fear which was expressed in the last Report that a still further number of gentlemen who have been members for many years are likely to vacate their seats seems only too well founded, for intimations are already to hand that there will be several vacancies at the ensuing election. Accounts. The accounts of the Board's receipts and expenditure have been prepared in the same form as on previous occasions. Mr. T. P. Scrivener, the Board's Chartered Accountant, has regularly examined the books of the Board, and the annual statements have been submitted to the Auditors elected, by whom they have been certified as correct, as appears by their certificate at the end of the accounts, which will be found on pages 22 to 37 of this Report. The St. Giles Churchyard. In the last Report the progress that had been made with a view to the laying out and opening to the public of the disused burial ground adjoining the St. Giles Church was referred to, and it is only now necessary to state that on 11 Wednesday, July 13, 1891, the grounds were thrown open to the public. The ceremony was performed by the Right Reverend the Bishop of Winchester, Dr. A. W. Thorold, formerly Rector of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. The order of proceedings may be generally summarized as follows:— The Lord Bishop of Winchester arrived at 4 o'clock, and was met by the Rev. Canon Nisbet, the Rector of St. Gilesin-the-Fields, Charles Bussell and Gilbert Smith, Esqres., the Churchwardens, and Charles Fitz-Roy Doll, Esq., the Chairman of the Works Committee of the Board. His Lordship immediately proceeded up the main entrance through the Church, and so entered the Churchyard. The Members of the Board of Works for the St. Giles District, and of the Joint Vestry of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, and the Guardians of the Poo having previously assembled, formed in procession and followed his Lordship. On arriving at the spot selected for the ceremony, the Rev. Canon Nisbet, the Rector of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, welcomed the Lord Bishop of Winchester. Charles Fitz-Roy Doll, Esq., the Chairman of the Works Committee, addressed the Lord Bishop, and asked him to declare the Churchyard open for the use of the public for ever. The Lord Bishop of Winchester replied and declared the Churchyard open. A hymn was then sung. Charles Bussell, Esq., senior Churchwarden of St. Gilesin-the-Fields, moved a vote of thanks to the Bishop of Winchester for attending, which was seconded by J. F. Corben, Esq., Chairman of the Board of Guardians, and carried unanimously. 12 The Lord Bishop then replied, and the gates were opened by Mrs. Fitz-Roy Doll. Since the opening of the grounds they have been patronised by a very large number of persons. A drinking fountain which formerly stood at the junction of Broad Street with Great St. Andrew Street, and which was removed in consequence of the laying out of the new street from Piccadilly to Bloomsbury, has been erected by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in the Churchyard, and a number of seats have been given by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association and placed in the ground, in addition to those previously provided by the Board. To both these Associations great thanks are due for their assistance and for the improvement which has thus been rendered to the Garden. The nature of the ground and the surroundings of the land are such as to render constant attention necessary. It is to be regretted that the plants and shrubs provided are not in a more flourishing condition, but it is hoped that care and attention will in time remedy this. Vacant Land in Shaftesbury Avenue. The northernmost piece of land at the entrance to Shaftesburv Avenue from New Oxford Street was during the year paved with asphalte and laid out as an openspace and planted with trees. In the centre a handsome lamp column has been erected, surrounded by seats. The work of constructing an underground place of convenience for men and women on the southernmost piece of land was completed, and on the 1st January 1892, the lavatories were opened. The way in which they have since been made use of gives ample evidence of how much they were needed. 13 The whole of the works connected with these two pieces of land were carried out from plans prepared by the Engineer and Surveyor to the Board, and under his personal supervision. The following statement, which was prepared at the time gives detailed particulars of the construction of the convenience. This convenience has been constructed by the Board on a small piece of land granted to it by the London County Council for the purpose, out of the surplus land acquired for constructing the new street from Piccadilly to Bloomsbury, which was authorised by the Metropolitan Street Improvement Act, 1877. The site available for the works was somewhat limited in character, but the best use has been made of it. The superficial area of the whole is under 1,000 feet. At an average depth of about ten feet below the level of the adjoining public way conveniences for men and women have been provided. In the men's department there are four closets, ten urinals, and two lavatories. The whole of the urinals and one watercloset are available for use free of charge. For the other closets, and for the lavatories, a charge of one penny for each person is made. In the women's department there are three closets and one lavatory; in this case also one closet is free, and for the others, and for the use of the lavatory, a charge of one penny for each person is made. The work has been executed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by Mr. George Wallace, the Engineer and Surveyor to the Board. The Contractors were Messrs. C. W. Killingback & Co., of Bewley Cliff Wharf, James Street, Camden Town, N.W. The sanitary arrangements have been carried out by Mr. George Jennings, of Palace Wharf, Stangate, Lambeth, and the whole of the internal fittings are of the most modern description. The w. c.'s and urinals are all disinfected by Jennings' Self-Acting Disinfector. The closets for which payment is required are fitted with Hancock's Patent Automatic Door Locks. The surface over the convenience is formed of Messrs. Hay ward's pavement lights. The entrances are enclosed with wrought-iron railings, and in the centre of the structure it is intended to place an ornamental ventilating lamp column, which is being cast by Messrs. Pontifex & Co., of No. 22, Coleman Street, E.C., from the design of Mr. G. Wallace. Around the 14 boundary of the convenience trees have been planted, and it is proposed to place seats or shrubs on the vacant portion of the public way. The net cost of the work is estimated at about £2,000. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891. A Bill to consolidate the law relating to public health in the county of London was introduced into the House of Commons by the Eight Hon. C. T. Kitchie, President of the Local Government Board, on the 25th day of February, 1891. The Board had had an opportunity of offering their observations on the draft Bill as a consolidation Bill some time previously. After the consolidation Bill had been read a second time, a Bill for the amendment of the laws relating to public health in the metropolis was also introduced, and having been read a second time were both referred to the Standing Committee on Law, when they were subsequently amalgamated in one measure, and under the title of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, passed into law on the 5th day of August, 1891, and came into operation on the 1st day of January, 1892. The Act makes several important amendments of the existing law, and the increased powers that have been given by it to Local Authorities have already been found to be of great advantage. Particulars of the proceedings which have been carried out under the Act will be of interest, and the following statistics are therefore given. Number of notices served:— For abatement of nuisances 126 „ „ „ overcrowding 6 ,, disinfection after infectious diseases 44 15 Synopsis of sections as to ceasing to occupy house without disinfection, and as to the disposal of infected rubbish 44 Number of cases in which proceedings have been taken before Police 7 Magistrate Number of cases in which the work has been carried out by the Board 2 under Magistrate's order In addition to the above, 381 notices requiring the abatement of breaches of regulations made by the Board as to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family were also served. These notices received attention in all except 2 cases, in which proceedings were taken before police magistrates. The Shelton Street Area. Reference was made in the last Annual Report to the proposals of the London County Council for dealing with this area. The Bill for confirming the Provisional Order as amended was duly passed into law in the last session of Parliament, and since that date the work of widening Macklin Street and Parker Street, and constructing the new street between Parker Street and Shelton Street, has been carried out, and the London County Council are now engaged in erecting a model common lodging-house on the Parker Street frontage. Several plots of land that are not required for the purpose of the lodging-house are about to be offered for sale by public auction for the purpose of constructing on them artizans' dwellings. With the rate of progress that is being made with the lodging-house it is anticipated that this area will be shortly again populated, and that this will reduce the pressure on 16 the surrounding neighbourhood, which is at present very great. Trees and Seats in Open Spaces. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association have, during the past year, contributed the sum of £100, which has been expended by the Board in tree planting in various thoroughfares in the District. They have also given to the Board 24 seats. The trees and seats were disposed of as follows:— In Shaftesbury Avenue 13 trees. Do. on vacant Land 3 seats. Do. at Underground Convenience 4 seats. In North Crescent 6 trees and 3 seats. In South do. 6 trees and 2 seats. In St. Giles Churchyard 12 seats. Parliamentary Schemes. (a) PUBLIC BILLS. Among the Public Bills which received consideration at the hands of the Law and Parliamentary Committee and the Officers of the Board were the following. It was not, however, deemed necessary to take any action upon them. Dangerous Employment (Hours of Labour). School Board for London (Superannuation). Beer Adulteration. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 (Amendment). Housing of the Working Classes. Shops Weekly Half Holiday. Hospitals (Assistance from Bates). Libraries Law Consolidation. Hop Substitutes. Smoke Nuisance, Metropolis. 17 (b) PRIVATE BILLS. The following Private Bills affected the District of the Board, and the subjoined particulars will therefore be interesting. HAMPSTEAD, ST. PANCRAS AND CHARING CROSS RAILWAY. This was a scheme for providing a railway from Hampstead to Charing Cross; it proposed, so far as the Board's District was concerned, to run beneath Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross Road. The question of electric and cable railways in the Metropolis received special attention at the hands of a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament, who in a report made certain recommendations. After the consideration of this report the Bill was read a second time and referred to a Select Committee, but up to the time of writing this report no progress has been made with it.* NORTH METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS EXTENSION. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company were desirous of extending their Tramway from Theobald's Road along Vernon Place, Bloomsbury Square, Hart Street and into Bury Street, to a terminus adjoining New Oxford Street. A very influentially signed memorial protesting against the scheme was presented to the Board, and having regard to all the circumstances of the case the Board decided to refuse its consent, and the Promoters were therefore unable to comply with the standing orders of the House of Commons, and were obliged to strike their proposals out of the Bill. * The Bill has, in consequence of the dissolution of Parliament, been deferred to the next Session of Parliament. c 18 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL GENERAL POWERS BILL. The only question in this Bill specially affecting the St. Giles District was that relating to the proposals to throw open Lincoln's Inn Fields. The Board did not take any action either for or against the proposals, but when the Bill came before the Select Committee of the House of Commons the clause was struck out. NATIONAL TELEPHONE COMPANY'S BILL. NEW TELEPHONE COMPANY'S BILL. These Bills were promoted by two of the Companies providing telephonic communication in the Metropolis for conferring further powers upon them. Grave objections were entertained to certain of the proposals which the Bills contained, and petitions were therefore presented to the House of Commons against the measures, but no progress has been made with either of them at the time of writing this Report. Renaming Streets. During the year under review an order of the London County Council for abolishing the name Feathers Court and renaming that thoroughfare Holborn Place has been received and carried into effect. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, During the past year 186 samples have been purchased and analysed under the Act, consisting of the following:— Milk, butter, pepper, peas, beans, brandy, whisky, gin and rum. In 21 cases the samples proved to be adulterated. In one of these instances the adulteration was of so trifling a nature that no action was taken, but in 20 cases 19 ings were taken against the offenders, and in every instance a conviction was obtained and fines and costs inflicted by the magistrate amounting to the sum of £29 15s. While dealing with this subject the Board have to regret the loss of Dr. Theophilus Redwood, who had acted as the Board's Analyst since the passing of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. On receiving the intelligence of his death the Board ordered a resolution of sympathy to be forwarded to his relatives. Public Libraries Act, Adoption of. On the 28th day of April, 1891, the Board received a requisition under the. Public Libraries Act, 1855-1890, requiring them to ascertain the opinion of the Electors of the District (a) as to the adoption of the Libraries Act and (b) as to limiting the rate to one halfpenny. For the purpose of the poll the Clerk to the Board was appointed to act as Presiding Officer. The opinion of the Electors in the District was taken by means of voting papers on the 12th day of May, and the following result was reported to the Board on the 13th day of May:— The number of Voting Papers issued corresponds with the number of Voters on the Register, viz. 6826 The number of persons voting "Yes" in favour of the adoption of the Acts, was 1746 The number of persons voting "No" against the adoption of the Acts, was 876 The number of persons voting "Yes " in favour of the rate being limited to one halfpenny in the £, was 1602 The number of persons voting " No " against the rate being limited to one halfpenny in the £, was 755 The number of invalid Voting Papers was as follows:— Marked "Yes" in favour of the adoption of the Acts 136 C 2 20 Marked "No" against the adoption of the Acts 100 Marked "Yes" in favour of the rate being limited to one halfpenny in the £ 115 Marked " No" against the rate being limited to one halfpenny in the £ 94 Papers irregularly filled up 116 The number of papers not filled up was 1920 The number of papers not returned was 1925 On the 9th day of June, 1891, the following gentlemen were appointed as Library Commissioners for the ensuing year:— BUSSELL, Mr. CHARLES. FORBES-ROBEBTSON, Mr. JOHN. DEED, Mr. MARTIN. NEALE, Mr. JAMES. DOLL, Mr. CHARLES FIT2-R0Y. SMITH, Dr. WILLIAM R. New Street from High Holborn to the Strand. This extremely important improvement has again occupied the serious attention of the Board, and they have from time to time made representations to the London County Council on the subject. It is much to be regretted that no steps have yet been taken with a view to carrying out the improvement. HENRY C. JONES, Clerk to the Board. 21 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST APPOINTED UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, During the year ending 25th March, 1892, Dr. Redwood received from your Inspectors, Messrs. J. Robinson and W. H. Bond, 186 samples for analysis, viz., 92 samples from Inspector Robinson, and 94 samples from W. H. Bond. These samples consisted of 109 of milk, 16 of butter, 23 of peppers, black, white and cayenne peppers, 9 of preserved vegetables, green peas, haricot and French beans, and 29 of spirits, including rum, gin, brandy, and whisky. 81 of the milks proved to be not adulterated, but 9 of the samples were poor in quality, and 4 of them could only be returned as very poor milk. One was adulterated with 5 per cent., 1 with 6 per cent., 2 with 9 per cent., 2 with 10 per cent., 1 with 12 per cent., 1 with 13 per cent., 1 with 15 per cent., 1 with 18 per cent., 1 with 20 per cent., 1 with 27 per cent., 1 with 30 per cent., and 1 with 37 per cent. of added water. In addition to these 1 sample sold as milk was skimmed milk. 13 of the 16 butters were genuine, whilst 3 samples contained, respectively, 35, 45, and 80 per cent. of foreign fat. One, only, of the 23 peppers submitted was adulterated, and that one, a white pepper, contained 20 per cent. of rice starch. Of the spirits examined a sample of rum was adulterated with 3 per cent. of added water, and a whisky with 74 per cent. of the same adulterant. The preserved vegetables were in a wholesome condition, and although minute traces of copper could be detected in all the samples of green peas and French beans, the amount was such as to exclude any action being taken. I am, Gentlemen, your obedient Servant, A. J. DE HAILES. 2, Fisher Street, Red Lion Square London, W.C. 9th May, 1892. 22 23 THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE SAINT GILES DISTRICT.

The carriage way paving of Bolton Gardens, which is a private way not repairable by the Board, being in bad repair, notice was served on the adjoining owners to make good the same, which not being done, the Board, under the powers conferred on it by the Metropolis Local Management Act, executed the work, charging the expense of the same to the owners. The wood paving at the entrance to Colonnade was 41 taken up and new Jarrah wood blocks laid at a cost of £27 11s. 2d. The following macadamized roads were re-coated with broken granite, a steam roller seven tons in weight being used to level the surface:— Arthur Street. Chenies Street. Bedford Square. Goldsmith Street. Brunswick Square. Montague Place. Russell Square. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. During the year Contracts were entered into between your Board and the several Contractors who laid the pavements, for a further maintenance for 15 years of the following streets, at the prices per yard superficial placed against the same:— Guilford Street 8d. per yard superficial per annum. Duke Street 6d. ,, „ Torrington Street 6d. „ „ Obstructive Spur Stones. The spur stones placed against lamp posts and guard posts in the District, which were an obstruction to the public traffic, have been removed during the year and the paving made good at a cost of £88 6s. 4d. Sewers. The following Sewer Works were performed during the year:— 42 Hyde Street 50 feet run new 4 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. brick sewer. Lumber Court 78 feet do. do. Serle Street 65 feet do. do. Lincoln's Inn Fields 144 feet run new 12 in. pipe sewer. Russell Square, east side, from Guilford Street to Bernard Street 177 feet run of existing sewer underpinned and repaired. Great Coram Street, from Woburn Place to Little Coram Street 262 feet do. do. New Yard New side entrance. The invert of the sewer in Parker Street for a length of about 140 feet west of Newton Street being defective was removed and a new invert formed. An old brick sewer that ran from the public sewer in High Street to the front of the house No. 4, High Street, and again from the back frontage of the said house into Clarke's Mews, was destroyed, and new 12 inch pipes laid in lieu thereof, connecting with the sewer in High Street. The old pipe sewer in Great Turnstile for a length of about 60 feet being found defective, was removed, and new 12 inch pipes substituted. In connection with this work a flushing tank was constructed at its head by Newman's Row. The whole of the covers to the side entrance to sewers were repaired and painted at a cost of £22 9s. 2d. The flushing gates in the sewers were repaired at a cost of £40 15s. 10d. Flushing of Sewers and Courts. The following sewers were twice flushed by water obtained from the New River mains ; once in June and once in September. 43 Abbey Place. Alfred Mews. Bainbridge Street. Bernard Mews. Brunswick Mews.

Feathers Court. Lascelles Court. Lascelles Place. Little Turnstile. Lloyds Court. Nottingham Court Princes Court. Shelton Street. Twyford Buildings. Street Cleansing. The scavenging of the District was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board numbering 36 men and 16 boys to the end of the year 1891, but at the commencement of the present year, in consequence of the additional work thrown upon the Board by the Public Health Act, this 44 staff was increased to 37, consisting of 1 foreman, 5 gangers, and 31 sweepers, and 26 boys, the total scavenging staff now, therefore, amounts to 63 men and boys. In addition to the manual labour, two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were also used in sweeping the carriageways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 6,164 van loads, equal to over 18,000 cubic yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares that are paved with wood and asphalte were washed frequently during the year by means of watering-carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter The market streets in the District and the streets inhabited by the poorer classes, of which the following is a list, were cleansed on Sundays between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m., those streets in the list marked with an asterisk being cleansed a second time between 12 noon and 2.30 p.m. After the second cleansing the streets were watered with a weak solution of permanganate of potash ;— Abbey Place. Arthur Street. Bainbridge Street. Castle Street. Colonnade. Kenton Street. Little Coram Street and Courts adjacent. Little Guilford Street. Marchmont Street. Castle Street. Church Passage. *Drury Lane.

Endell Street. Great Queen Street. Great Saint Andrew Street. H art Street. High Holborn. High Street. Kingsgate Street. Little Queen Street. Little Saint Andrew Street. New Compton Street. New Oxford Street. Shaftesbury Avenue. Southampton Bow. Theobald's Road. Tottenham Court Road. Vernon Place. The main thoroughfares in the District were also watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. Removal of Snow. Snow fell on several occasions during the months of February and March of the present year, but not at any time to any great depth. The work of dealing with these snowfalls necessitated the employment of a number of additional men. The bulk of the snow was removed to the Thames Embankment and thrown into the River Thames as in previous years, but a considerable quantity of it was disposed of by flushing the streets with water from the New River Company's mains. Street-orderly Bins, &c. Several new street-orderly bins have been erected during the year. The bins now in the District number 39, and are situated as follows:— Bedford Place 2 Bloomsbury Square 2 46 Bloomsbury Street 1 Charing Cross Road 1 Charlotte Street 2 Great Russell Street 5 Hart Street 2 High Holborn 4 High Street 2 HunterStreet 3 Little Queen Street 1 Montague Street 3 Museum Street 1 New Oxford Street 3 Russell Square (east side) 3 Southampton Row 2 Store Street 2 Total 39 In accordance with the resolution of the Board several bins for storing shell ballast for strewing upon the asphalte and wood pavements, when their condition render it desirable, have been erected in the District. The following is a list of them:— In High Holborn, by the Royal Music Hall. „ „ „ opposite No. 196. „ New Oxford Street, opposite Mudie's Library. „ Tottenham Court Road, south end by New Oxford Street. Further bins will be erected shortly. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1891-92 was as follows:— 47  £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 2,709 10 11 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 561 5 5 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street-sweeping machines 3,110 0 0 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, &c. 602 11 4 Total £6,983 7 8 Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the District which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used (including that used for washing the streets) amounted to 4,158,000 gallons. During the hot summer months a small quantity of permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering-carts. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 195 2 7 To Contractors for horses, carts, and men 913 4 0 For permanganate of potash 29 1 0 Total £1,137 7 7 Eemoval of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,000 48 The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant being £10 15s. 0d. Limewhiting Courts. The Avails at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £45 15s. 0d. Bernard Mews.

This lavatory, which is for the convenience of men and women, was opened to the public on the 1st January, 1892, and has during the few months it has been open, been extensively used. The lavatory contains, in the men's compartment four w. c.'s, ten urinals and two basins lor washing, and in the women's portion three w. c.'s and one washing basin. 49 In each compartment one of the w. c.'s is free of charge. That in the women's is much used, and it seems desirable to retain it, but in the men's the privilege is much abused, the w. c. and its fittings being much defiled. The structure was built by Messrs. C. W. Killingback & Co., from designs prepared by your Surveyer. The sanitary fittings are by Mr. G. Jennings. The total cost of the work was £2,140 2s. 7d. Trees have been planted by your Board around the site, and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association has planted shrubs around the staircases leading down to the Lavatories. Public Urinals. The public urinals in the District number 14, and contain 46 compartments; 11 have water laid on to them, the others are without water supply. The whole are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. The urinal in Nottingham Court being in a bad state of repair, your Board decided to demolish the same, which was accordingly done. The urinal in Bidgmount Gardens was removed in November, 1891. The urinalin Parker Street, which accommodated 2 persons, being complained of by the adjoining householders, was removed in September last, and a new urinal with 3 compartments was erected by Mr. G. Jennings, at a cost of £57 9s. 5d. LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS IN THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Bainbridge Street 5 compartments, fitted with water supply. Colonnade 1 do. do. do.

As occasion has arisen during the year new circular lamps have been fixed in lieu of the old square lanterns; the total number of the new lamps in the District at the present time, each consuming 5 feet of gas per hour, is 896; and of the old square pattern lamps, 158. There are also 7 5 lamps of larger size at the corners of certain streets and on the crossing refuges, making a total of 1,129 public lamps in the District belonging to the Board. Names of Streets on Lamps. The question of notifying the names of streets by means of the public lamps was again before the Board, and as an experiment 50 tablets with the street's name thereon were affixed to the reflectors of some of the lamps in the main thoroughfares of the District. 51 Fire Tablets. Your Board, as the result of a communication received from the London County Council on the subject, has had affixed to twelve of the public lamps, tablets drawingattention to the situation of the nearest fire stations, escapes, and alarms. Street Refuges. No additional street-crossing refuges have been formed during the year. The refuges now existing within the St. Giles District are as follows:— In Bloomsbury Street south side of Shaftesbury Avenue. Do. south end, by Broad Street. „ Broad Street opposite Clarke3 Buildings. Do. east of Endell Street. Do. west of Endell Street. „ Charing Cross Road north end, by High Street.

A triangular piece of land situate in Shaftesbury Avenue, near its junction with New Oxford Street, which had remained vacant since the formation of the new street in the year 1887, was granted by the London County Council to your Board on condition of its being laid out by you for the use of the public. This has been done, trees being planted, and a handsome lamp with iron seats around it placed in the centre, the remaining area being paved with asphalte. St. Giles Churchyard. The ground adjoining St. Giles Church in High Street, to which reference was made in my last report, has been thrown open for the use of the public. The Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association has erected here the drinking fountain that formerly stood at the north end of Broad Street. Trees and Seats in Streets. A number of additional trees have been planted in Shaftesbury Avenue, and also in North and South Crescents, at a cost of £108 6s. 8d., towards which the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association contributed £l00. This Association has presented to your Board two dozen garden seats; a dozen of these are placed in the St. Giles 53 Churchyard, and the remainder in Shaftesbury Avenue and North and South Crescents. Shelton Street Scheme. Widening of Macklin and Parker Streets. This scheme has been proceeded with during the year. The London County Council obtained powers for closing a portion of Shelton Street, forming a new street 20 feet wide to connect Shelton and Parker Streets, and for widening portions of the public ways of Macklin Street and Parker Street. The work of forming the new street has, by arrangement with the London County Council, been performed by this Board at the Council's expense; the paving of the widened portions of Macklin Street and Parker Street has been performed by your Board at its own expense. Macklin Street, which averaged 16 feet in width, has been made in portions 30 feet wide, and Parker Street, which averaged 18 feet, has been made for a great portion of its length 40 feet wide. Bins for Trade Refuse. Your Board had under consideration the condition of the market streets in the District, and resolved to place in the carriage-way of Little Karl Street 12 portable iron bins for the reception of the animal and vegetable refuse which the traders using the street had been in the habit of throwing on to the public way. This was done, and so well fulfilled their purpose that your Board has since provided 6 additional bins for the same street. 54 Miscellaneous. The London Hydraulic Power Company extended, with the permission of your Board, their mains in Charing Cross Road into Phoenix Street. Two automatic postage stamp delivery machines were attached, with the consent of the Board, to existing pillar boxes in Cambridge Circus and in Gower Street, but have since been removed The Postal authorities have, by permission of your Board, erected a pillar box at the corner of Russell Square and Guilford Street.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present you the thirty-sixth Annual Report of the health of the District for the registration year ending January 2, 1892, a period of 52 weeks. Vital Statistics. The whole area of St. Giles District is computed to be a total of 245 acres, viz.:— St. George, Bloomsbury 122 acres. St. Giles-in-the-Fields 123 acres. and the number of inhabited houses (Census 1891), 4,068; an increase of 110 since the Census of 1881. The population of the two parishes, according to the corrected Census returns from 1861 to 1881, was as follows:— Registration Sub-Districts. Census, 1861. Census, 1871. Census, 1881. St. George, Bloomsbury 17,392 16,662 16,681 St. Giles, South St. Giles-in- 19,483 14,862 14,864 St. Giles, North the-Fields. 17,201 13,733 *13,732 St. Giles District 54,076 45,257 45,277 * The enumerated population of St. Giles, North, according to the corrected Census of 1881, was 13,837; but this number was corrected prior to the Census 1891, to 13,732, because the detached part of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, named Eve Terrace, Old Saint Pancras Road, was separated from there and amalgamated with the parish of Pancras—vide Local Government Board Order No. 26,577, dated 24th March, 1891. 60 The Census of 1891 "was taken on April 6 last, when the population of the District was found to be:— Increase or decrease of Population between 1881 and 1891. Increase. Decrease. St. Georsre. Bloomsbury 16,695 14 St. Giles-in-the-Fields South, 13,450 1,414 North, 9,633 — 4,099 Total 39,778 14 5,513 a loss of 5,499 inhabitants since 1881. The decrease of population in the three decades being 1.0 per cent. in 1861-71, 15.6 per cent. in 1871-81, and 12.1 percent. in 1881-91. Since the Census 1861 the population has been reduced by 14,298 inhabitants. In 1861 the mean rate of population to each house was 11.5, in 1891 it was 9.7. This reduction of density of population, largely caused by the carrying out of local improvements, has been most conducive to the health of the District. Marriages and Marriage-rate. 1891. Population (Census 1891). Number of Marriages. Marriagerate per 1,000. Average Marriagerate per 1,000 for ten years, 1881-90. St. Giles District 39,778 370 18.6 14.7 It will be seen from the above table that 370 marriages took place during the year 1891 in the District. 226 of the marriages were celebrated at the parish churches, 64 at 61 The marriage-rate, 18'6 per 1,000, is satisfactory, showing an increase of 3"4 per 1,000 over that of the preceding year and 3*9 per 1,000 higher than that of the decennial average. The marriages in London in the year 1891 numbered 37,298, and the proportion of persons married to the total population was 17*7 per 1,000, this rate being higher than in any year since 1883. In England and Wales the marriages of 452,050 persons were registered, giving an annual rate of 15'5 per 1,000 of the estimated population. the several Nonconformist places of worship, and 80 at the Superintendent-Registrar's Office, Broad Street, as follows : Name of Building.

The average rate for the preceding 10 years, 1881-90, was 28.5 per 1,000. The birth-rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, 20.4, was identical with that of the previous year. The birth-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 34'8 per 1,000, a rate of 5.4 per 1,000 in excess of that of the preceding year, and no less than 14.4 per 1,000 higher than the rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The birth-rate for the whole of St. Giles District, 28.8 per 1,000, was 2. higher than the rate for 1890. The registered births were 54 in excess of the deaths. In London there were 134,003 births registered in the population of 4,221,452 (estimated population middle of 1891) corresponding to an annual birth-rate of 31.8 per 1,000 living; this was a considerable rise from the rate in the preceding year, 30.8, but with this exception the rate in 1891 was the lowest as yet recorded; the excess of births over deaths was 43,787. 63 In England and Wales 913,836 births were registered during the year 1891, corresponding to a birth-rate of 31.4 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 326,170 against an average increase in the previous five years of 353,247. Deaths and Death-rate. Registration Sub-Districts.

This number will not give a true death-rate, therefore corrections have to be made to the registered deaths in the District by adding 261 deaths of parishioners in the Metropolitan Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums, and other Public Institutions situated outside the District, and by deducting 72 deaths of non-parishioners, viz.: 5 at the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street; 18 at the Workhouse, Broad Street; 64 45 at the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue; and 4 at other public places situated within the District. The deaths of parishioners at the Workhouse, which were registered in South St.' Giles, are distributed among the subdistricts according to the previous residence of the deceased persons. These alterations increase the number of deaths to 1,092. The results of the corrections will be seen in the table above. The death-rate for the whole of St. Giles District, 27.4 per 1.000, was 6.0 higher than the rate for all London, and 7.2 higher than that for all England and Wales. The death-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 33'9 per 1,000, a rate 15.5 per 1,000 higher than that for Bloomsbury. There was again the same disproportions in the two divisions of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, the rate for the southern part being 12.7 per 1,000 higher than that of the northern. As a set off to the high death-rate in St. Giles South, it must not be forgotten that the birth-rate for the same part of the parish was as high as 39.6 per 1,000. In London the deaths were 90,216, corresponding to an annual death-rate of 21.4 per 1,000, the same as the rate in the immediately preceding year, but with this exception, the rate in 1891 was higher than in any year since 1882. In England and Wales, 587,666 deaths were registered, giving a death-rate of 20.2 per 1,000, which is lower than the rate recorded in any year prior to 1881. Deaths of Young Children, 352 children died before they reached 5 years of age, being two above the decennial average 1881-90. 65 213 were deaths of infants under 1 year, and were equivalent to 18.5 per 1,000 of registered births (against 15.4 in all London), and 19.5 per 1,000 of total deaths. 139 chilldren died between 1 and 5 years of age, and were equivalent to 32.2 per 1,000 of total deaths. 103 children died from zymotic causes, principally measles, whooping-cough and diarrhoea, 77 from wasting diseases, which include debility and premature birth, 40 were from various forms of convulsive diseases, and 77 from bronchitis, pneumonia, and other diseases of the respiratory organs. 9 children were overlaid in bed by their parents. The proportion of such deaths throughout London during the year is between 600 and 700, and of this total somewhat over 200 are furnished by the central districts alone. Dr. Danford Thomas, the Coroner for Central Middlesex, gives as his opinion " that the fatal result is commonly brought about either to the child slipping under the bedclothes when the mother's arm on which it lies becomes relaxed in sleep, or to its being drawn too near and pressed against the breasts." Some remarkable statistics relating to the suffocation of infants in bed are published in the Registrar-General's last annual report. "It appears that the number of such deaths has been steadily increasing in recent years," and " It wa3 found that the proportion of deaths of infants from overlying is more than twice as high on Saturday night as on any other night of the week; the explanation of this fact is that the amount of intoxication is greater on Saturday than on any other day." Senile Mortality. There were 295 deaths recorded at 60 years of age and upwards, against 277, 153 and 159 in the three f 66 preceding years, being equivalent to 27 per cent. of total deaths. The number of deaths of old people occurred at the following advanced ages:— 142 between 60 and 70 years of age. Ill „ 70 and 80 „ „ 36 „ 80 and 90 „ „ 2 at 90 years of age. 2 „ 91 „ 1 „ 92 „ _L „ 94 „ Total 295 41 of the deaths were certified to have been from " old age," i.e., not to have been caused by disease but from decay of nature. The diseases which caused the greatest fatality amongst the aged were diseases of the lungs and bronchitis 109, diseases of the brain, paralysis and senile dementia 50, diseases of the heart 25, cancer 17, and influenza 12. Mortality from the Principal Zymotic Diseases. The seven principal zymotic diseases are small-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, fever (which includes enteric, typhus and simple continued forms of fever) and diarrhoea. In London there were 9,588 deaths registered from these diseases, equal to a death-rate of 2.2 per 1,000; this mortality was the lowest on record. In England and Wales, 53,221 deaths were attributed to these diseases, corresponding to a rate of 1.83 per 1,000 living 67 against 1.86, 2.22 and 2.14 in the immediately preceding three years. In St. Giles District these deaths numbered 113, and equalled a rate of 2.9 per 1.000 against 1.9, 25 and 14 in the three preceding years. Small-Pox (decennial average 5.1).—The past year is the sixth in which London has enjoyed practical immunity from the disease. In the spring of the year it showed a tendency to spread in the metropolis, and cases were removed from twenty different localities into the hospitals of the Asylums Board. The majority of cases came from the Port of London and the neighbourhood of the docks. During the remainder of the year five other cases were removed, making a total of 64* patients received into the Manager's Hospitals (no fewer than 43 occurred between April 13 and May 14); 8 of the cases terminated fatally. The deaths from it in the whole of England and Wales during the same period were only 48. The Local Government Board issued a circular calling attention to the fact that for some time isolated cases of smallpox had occurred in different parts of London, and urgimg the importance of special vigilance in the matter. Medical Officers of Health were requested in all cases which were notified to them, or which came to their knowledge, to visit the houses where the disease had broken out, and at the earliest possible moment to take such measures as may be necessary to secure as far as practicable the isolation of the patients, the vaccination of any persons who may have been * The total number of patients certified to be suffering from small-pox and removed from their homes to the hospitals of the Asylums Board during the year was 90; of these 26 patients were found not to have smallpox, and were returned to their homes at once. F 2 68 exposed to infection, and the disinfection of the premises, and any further action which the circumstances will admit of for the purposes of checking the extension of the disease. In St. Giles District there has only been one death (in 1887) since 1885 from small-pox. In March, 1891, a notification was received that a male adult, lodging in a good house in the District, was suffering from it. On receipt of the information the patient was promptly removed to the Asylums Board's hospital, and the usual precautions relative to disinfection and re-vaccination were taken, with the result that no further case was reported. From enquiries, I found that this young man had evidently contracted the disease from some one in another part of the Metropolis, but from whom I was unable to trace. Scarlet Fever (decennial average 10.9).—In 1891 this disease caused 589 deaths in the metropolis, and 4,845 in the whole of England and Wales. In this District 103 cases were notified, all of which recovered; of these 56 were removed to hospitals. During the year the total number of scarlet fever patients admitted to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board amounted to 5,262, of whom 357 died, a mortality of only 6.11 per cent., a death-rate lower than that of any previous year since the opening of the Board's hospitals in 1870. Dr. Caiger, the Medical Superintendent of the Southwestern Fever Hospital, in an analysis of over 1,000 cases admitted, states " that the period and extent of desquamation (peeling) varied in different cases within wide limits. In some instances„ namely, in adults and very young children, it was completed in less than six weeks; in others it was prolonged to 12 or even 16 weeks. 69 The detention in hospital averaged slightly over nine weeks. Measles (decennial average 28.3) in London was fatal in 1,807 cases, and in no less than 12,287 throughout England and Wales. In St. Giles District 32 children died from it. In consequence of this heavy fatality against not a single death from scarlet fever (which is notifiable), your Board, at my suggestion, has asked the approval of the Local Government Board for its inclusion amongst the notifiable infectious diseases. Diphtheria (decennial average 13.8).—The 11 deaths in this District were below the average, and call for no specialcomment. In the early part of the year outbreaks of the disease occurred both in the metropolis and the suburbs, referable to several causes. The total deaths in London from it were 1,361, throughout England and Wales 4,940. Dr. Thresh. Medical Officer of Health for the Chelmsford and Maiden Districts, in his paper on diphtheria, speaking of London manure and the disease, said " there could be no question as to the desirability of the speedy removal of garbage of all kinds from the metropolis. He had seen much of its employment on the land; some was brought in barges to the towns near the coast, but in his own district it came by road; the stench was horrible. It consisted of refuse from sausage manufactories and fishmongers' shops, butchers' blood, dead cats, with black slime apparently from street gulleys, and every description of filth—not unnaturally the country people attributed to it every outbreak of disease. Dr. Thorne Thorne, Principal Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, in his Milroy lectures on diphtheria, 70 delivered before the Royal College of Physicians, showed, by reference to statistics, "that during the last decennium there had been a substantial increase of diphtheria mortality in this country, and that a very significant portion of this increase had taken place in the metropolis. This increase was the more remarkable because whilst it had been in progress the zymotic group of diseases, and notably those causes of death which were amenable to sanitary administration and public health measures, had undergone steady diminution—he also showed that the incidence of diphtheria was undergoing a change, and the preference it had formerly shown for rural areas was being transferred to dense communities." The total number of patients removed to the hospitals of the Asylums Board certified at the time of removal to be suffering from diphtheria or from " diphtheritic membranous croup" was 1,481, as against 1,049 in 1890 and 770 in 1889. 1,312 of the 1,481 patients suffered from diphtheria, of whom 397 died, a mortality of 30'6 per cent. Whooping-Cough (decennial average 24.3).—The 29 deaths of young children were above the 10 years' average. In London the mortality was 1,000 in excess of that from measles. In England and Wales it caused 12,920 deaths, Diarrhoea (decennial average 29.5).—The 19 deaths were considerably less than the average, owing to the cold, dull, sunless and wet weather which prevailed during the summer and autumn. In July it was reported that a parishioner who had been removed from Woburn Place had died at the Home Hospital, Eitzroy Square, from "Choleranostras." Onmaking enquiries I found that the deceased (an Anglo-Indian) had first 71 suffered badly from influenza, which was followed by diarrhoea, lasting three weeks. The case appeared to have been one of chronic diarrhoea, probably resulting from liver disease. Fever (enteric, typhus, relapsing, and simple continued fevers—decennial average 12.3).—The 11 deaths in 1891 were slightly below the ten years' average. Enteric or typhoid fever was responsible for 10 deaths, and simple continued for 1. Again, typhus fever was entirely absent from the District. The following table, extracted From the interesting recent report by the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, showing the number of deaths from typhus fever registered in registration London during the 10 years, is valuable information that the disease is gradually being stamned out.

Other Zymotic Diseases. (Miasmatic.) Influenza in 1890 was fatal to 10 people in St. Giles District. In May, 1891, it reappeared, and caused 31 deaths at the following ages:— 72 1 to 5. Under 15 Years. Between 15 and 25 Years. Between 25 and 60 Years. Above 60 Years. Total Deaths. 1 1 2 15 12 31 26 were parishioners of St. Giles in the Fields, and 5 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury; 12 were inmates of the Workhouse. Two-thirds of the deaths occurred during May and June. In this country sporadic cases were noted in the Metropolis during the past winter (1890), but about the beginning of April, 1891, there was a return of the influenza in an epidemic form in certain towns in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and also in Birmingham. In the week ending April 25th, the death-rate for Sheffield reached the extraordinary figure of 57 per 1,000, against 38 per 1,000 for the highest weekly death-rate during the epidemic in 1890. The Registrar-General's Mortality returns for London in the week ending May 9th showed an increase of 433 deaths above the average number in the corresponding week of the last ten years. The deaths primarily attributed to influenza, which had been 10 and 37 in the preceding two weeks, rose to 148, or 21 in excess of the highest number during the 1890 outbreak; the deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs were 584, or 240 in excess. The number of patients suffering from influenza attending the London Hospitals was very large. At the end of May the disease distinctly declined in the Metropolis. In a paper read before the Epidemiological Society, Dr. Sisley concluded with the following propositions:—1. There 73 is no doubt that the disease is contagious. 2. Isolated cases precede a general infection of the community. 3. The part played by contagion in the spread of the disease is most important. 4. There is some evidence in favour of spread of influenza by goods. 5. Influenza is not spread in England by a preliminary " contamination of the atmosphere," but the atmosphere is contamiated by individuals who suffer from influenza.

Uncertified Deaths. Only one death, viz., that of an infant who survived her premature birth only a few hours, was returned as not having been certified by a registered medical practitioner or by the Coroner. The rate of uncertified deaths in London was l.O per cent., and in England and Wales 2.7 percent.; in St. Giles District it was 000'2 per cent. Deaths in Public Institutions. (Within the District) The Workhouse, Broad Street. The number of inmates during the past 12 months averaged 612, of these 29 belonged to the parishes of Bethnal Green and the Strand respectively. The Workhouse, Broad Street. The number of inmates during the past 12 months averaged 612, of these 29 belonged to the parishes of Bethnal Green and the Strand respectively. 78 The mortality was 1st Quarter 79 2nd „ 67 3rd 24 4th 25 A total of 195 deaths. To these must be added 7 4 deaths, which occurred at the Cleveland Street Sick Asylum, which make up a total of 269 pauper deaths, and corresponding to a death-rate of 43.9 per 1,000. My thanks are due to the staff of the Guardians for this and other valuable information. The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. 46 deaths (39 adults, and 7 children) took place at this public institution during the year. 45 were non-parishioners admitted from various parts of the Metropolis. The causes of deaths are classified as follows;— Zymotic diseases 3 Local diseases Heart 5 Lungs 17 Other diseases 20 Total 45 The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. The medical report states that the work of the Hospital has been carried on during the past year with good results. 79 There has been no sign of puerperal fever. The hygienic state of the hospital is excellent. 170 women were delivered of 171 children, 2 of the mothers succumbed, one of these was from pneumonia and starvation before labour commenced. 3 of the children died shortly after birth from debility and convulsions. The 5 deaths were those of nonparishioners. In the out-patient department there were 508 deliveries with only one maternal death, this latter fatality was the result of puerperal convulsions, which set in before the advent of labour. Deaths in Hospitals and Public Institutions. (Outside the District.) Returns are sent to me weekly from the RegistrarGeneral's office, Somerset House, in order that the rates of mortality should be made correct by the addition of deaths of residents in the district, in hospitals, lunatic asylums, and other public institutions, where they had been received for treatment Without such distribution the death-rates are misleading for comparative purposes.

The Act, amongst other important provisions and amendments, enacts that it will be the duty of the Sanitary Authority. (1) To cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district, so as to secure the proper condition of all premises. (2) To enforce bye-laws, which it is the duty of the Local Government Board, the London County Council, and the Sanitary Authorities to frame for a variety of purposes. (3) To carry out the provisions of the Smoke Consumption Act. (4) To order the inspection of workshops and bakehouses for the enforcement of certain provisions relating to them. h 2 100 (5) Provides that the London County Council may intervene, and carry into effect, within the district of any defaulting Local Authority, the duties in respect of which that authority is in default. 1 have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S.
