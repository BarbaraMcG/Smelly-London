REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health For the Year 1907. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 197, HIGH HOLBORN, W.C. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn. Gentlemen, In this Annual Report for the year 1907, the various statistics for the year refer to the fifty-two weeks ended Saturday, December 28th, 1907, as adopted by the Registrar-General, and known as the Registration year. The death statistics do not exactly correspond with those of the RegistrarGeneral for the following reasons: The Holborn Union includes the area of the old Holborn District Board of Works, Clerkenwell and St. Luke's. In many of the deaths registered in outlying public institutions the only address given is that of the Union, and from enquiries respecting some of these deaths which I have made of the authorities of the public institutions, I have ascertained that the previous addresses of the deceased before removal to the public institutions were not in this Borough, and these deaths, although returned by the Registrars as belonging to this Borough, have therefore been excluded. During the past three years the birth-rate has been corrected as far as possible by the exclusion of the births of infants whose mothers were non-residents, as it was only in the latter part of the year 1904 that the Registrar-General gave permission for the addresses and other details of births to be supplied by the Sub-Registrars. 6 The Holborn birth-rate 18.3 and the London birth-rate 25.6 are both the lowest recorded. The Holborn death-rate, 16.6, and the London death-rate, 14.6 per 1,000 are both the lowest death-rates recorded. The lowest death-rates in previous years in Holborn were 16.9 in 1905, 17.0 in 1906 and 17.9 in 1904. The average deathrate for the preceding decennium was 19.9 per 1,000 in Holborn, and 16.9 per 1,000 in London. The corrected infantile mortality was 131 per 1,000, in comparison with 116 for London. Last year these rates were 128 and 151 respectively. The death-rate from zymotic diseases in Holborn was again very low and below that for London, viz.1.29 in comparison with 142 per 1,000 which are both less than in the preceding year. On account of the cold, showery summer there was very little prevalence of diarrhoea during the year, the number of deaths having been only 16 in comparison with 39 in the preceding year and a decennial average of 38. The death-rate from Consumption has increased from 2.12 in 1906 to 2.28 in 1907, on the other hand, the London rate has decreased from 144 to 140 per 1,000. The rates for the preceding decennium were, Holborn 2.85 and London 1.63. Although there was increased prevalence of infectious disease in London last year, especially Scarlet Fever, the number of notifications in the Borough was again very small, being only 276, the same as for 1906. The notification rate for Holborn was again much lower than that for London generally, having been 5.0 per 1,000 in comparison with 8.6 for London. During the past six years this rate has always been lower than the London rate, and during the past four years, less than half of the rate for the years 1901 and 1902. The Metropolitan Asylums Board, in view of the continued prevalence of Scarlet Fever, notwithstanding the extensive isolation accommodation which has been provided, asked the Local Government Board to cause inquiry to be instituted into the cause of this disease and whether any, and if so what, further means can be adopted for its prevention. Under the heading "Scarlet Fever" I point out that during the past eighteen years, in which the notification of infectious disease has been in force, there has in several years been even a greater prevalence of Scarlet Fever, and that during the past nine years there has been a reduction of more than 22 per cent. of the cases notified per 1,000 as compared with the first nine years; also that the mortality per centage of patients treated, and the mortality rate per 1,000 have diminished about one-half during the same period. Also, that many scientific researches and expert inquiries respecting Scarlet Fever have been made. At a conference of the representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils held at the Paddington Town Hall, resolutions were passed that Pulmonary 7 Tuberculosis (Consumption) should be made compulsorily notifiable. Further details of the resolutions passed respecting further measures to limit the spread of the disease are given under that heading. The Local Government Board has recently published a large illustrated volume on Sanatoria for Consumption and certain other aspects of the Tuberculosis Question, which embodies a large mass of critical and statistical information respecting the subject. On the vexed question of the notification of Consumption, Dr. Bulstrode considers that the time has not yet arrived for judging, in the light of Phthisis death-rates, the value of notification in the repression of the disease. Under the heading of Infantile Mortality I have, in previous reports, pointed out the desirability of a much earlier registration of births than the six weeks after occurrence which is allowed by the existing law. The Council is well aware that the Notification of Births Act, 1907, was passed during the year and at an early opportunity it resolved to adopt the Act and the Local Government Board consented to this, the date fixed being the 9th March, 1908. On pages 13-16 some details are given respecting the important question of Infantile Mortality and the measures that have been taken to prevent infantile illnesses and deaths. The arrangements which have been in force since June, 1906, with the Express Dairy Company for the supply of modified milk for infants of the working classes for about the same charges as at Municipal Milk Depots, and without any cost to the Council, are becoming more known and more frequently used. In the majority of cases the mothers are very well satisfied and the infants thrive well on the milk. During the year, under the Cleansing of Persons Act, 247 men, 7 women, and 12 children infested with vermin, had their bodies and clothing disinfected free of charge. By April 15the, the day fixed for the adjourned meeting of the Local Government Board inquiry respecting the Warner Street (Italian Colony) Area, all the courts had been closed and partly demolished, affording light, ventilation and air space. The underground rooms had been discontinued for living purposes and the repairs, alterations and renovations agreed upon had been carried out. The erection of houses for the working classes on the site of the Union Buildings Area which was begun in August, 1906, was continued during the year and it is expected that they will be completed about the middle of 1908. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, increased powers are given with a view to preventing the sale of Tubercular Milk. Powers are also given for the compulsory cleansing of verminous children attending any of the London County Council's schools and verminous inmates of Common Lodging Houses. Also for the provision of water supply in tenement houses, for families on separate floors. 8 Although during the past three years the dust contract has been £800 per annum less than the preceding contract, the number of complaints from householders has very much diminished, especially during the past year. The Council has also effected a further saving of more than £200 per annum in salaries, as the duties of the dust Inspectors are now carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors. The removal of manure was again carried out satisfactorily, and for the first time no complaint was received during the year. Details respecting the inspections of factories, workshops, workplaces and outworkers premises are given on pages 38-40 and in Table IX, (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5). Also details of the new Order of the Home Secretary issued on the 23rd May 1907, which extends the sections relating to lists of outworkers; employment in unwholesome premises; and the prohibition of homework in places where there is infectious disease. A conference was held at the Home Office to consider the question of the further regulation of the industrial employment of women before and after childbirth, and the details of the form which the inquiry should take were agreed upon. Sanction was given by the Council to my co-operation in the Inquiry. During the year 20,890 inspections were made, 1,116 intimation notices were served, 672 notices for the cleansing of lodging houses, 280 notices for breach of by-laws or regulations, and 195 Statutory notices. The market streets are inspected daily, including Saturday nights and Sunday mornings. Applications were received for the removal and destruction as trade refuse of a large amount of unsound food, and during the year there were two seizures of meat, one unsound and one diseased, for which substantial penalties were inflicted. The mean temperature of the year was about half a degree lower than the average; the rainfall nearly 2 inches below the average, and the total amount of bright sunshine was 85 hours below the average.

Details of the age and sex distribution of the population were given in the Annual Report for the year 1902. The number of persons of foreign nationality in the Borough at the last Census was 5,706; 3,978 males and 1,728 females. Of these 2,029 were Italians, 1,098 Germans and 660 French. In the County of London the total number of foreigners was 135,377; 79,804 males and 55,573 females. Other details were given in the Annual Report for the year 1902. ESTIMATED POPULATION, 1907. The following are the estimated populations at the middle of the year 1907:— Bloomsbury and St. Giles 29,184 Holbcrn Sub-District 26,031 Holborn Borough 55,215 London 4,758,218 England and Wales 34,945,600 United Kingdom 44,104,321 RATEABLE VALUE, 1907.

As large a proportion as 37.5 per cent. of the population lived in tenements of one or two rooms, and 60.l per cent. of the population lived in tenements of one to four rooms. There were 3,725 tenements of 1 room. „ 3,834 „ 2 rooms. ,, 2,224 „ 3 „ ,,989 „ 4 „ REGISTERED BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATES. District. Males. Females. Both Sexes. Birtgh rate per 1,000. Legitimate.

The Registrar-General gave permission at the latter part of the year 1904 for details of births to be supplied by the Sub-Registrars. These details were at once supplied to us, so that I am now able to exclude the births of infants whose mothers were "non-residents." Of the 1,014 registered births in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, a large proportion of which took place at the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, as many as 568 were of infants whose mothers were non-residents in the Borough. The corrected numbers are as follows:— District Corrected number of Births ot Residents. Corrected Birth-rate per 1000. Legitimate. Illegitimate. Total. 1907. 1906.

The number of deaths of children under five years of age was:— St. Giles and Bloomsbury 78 Holborn Sub-District 147 Holborn Borough 225 The number of deaths of children under one year of age, and the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 total registered births and per 1,000 corrected births, were the following for:— Deaths under 1 year of age. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected births. St. Giles and Bloomsbury 49 48 122 Holborn Sub-District 83 149 138 Holborn Borough 132 84 131 London 14,114 - 116 The principal causes of death of these 132 children under one year of age are given in table V. of the Appendix. 14 Of the 132 deaths of infants during the year inquiries were made and details obtained by the Lady Inspector respecting 107. In some cases, especially in cases of illegitimate births, the mothers could not be found owing to change of address. Of the 107, 8 died from premature birth and before food was given. Of the remainder, 48 were naturally fed and 51 artificially fed. Of the 51 artificially fed, 45 used boat bottles and only 6 tube bottles. The number of tube bottles used is gradually diminishing. 9 of the mothers worked in factories or workshops; 9 others at charing or other work outside the home; and 4 were engaged in "homework" (tailoring); and 1 mother died. The remaining 84 were engaged only in their own household duties. As it was a cold, showery summer, there were very few deaths from diarrhoeal diseases in the summer months. During the year there were only 15 deaths of infants from diarrhoeal diseases, and all but one of these were artificially fed. CARE AND FEEDING OF INFANTS. With a view of diminishing the preventible infantile mortality in the Borough in 590 out of the 1,008 births of residents of the Borough, where the mothers lived in lodging houses or tenements, visits have been made by the Lady Sanitary Inspector and inquiries made, as to the number and condition of rooms occupied; the number of other children that have been born, including the number that have died ; the nature of food given to the infant and the method of feeding ; whether the child sleeps in a cot or not; and the occupation of the mother. If thought desirable, instructions are given respecting the care and feeding of the child, and a leaflet left. Notices are also served for any sanitary defects that may be found. Of the 590 visited during the year, 483 were naturally fed, and 107 partly or entirely artificially fed at the time of the first visit. Thus at the time of the first visit 18 per cent. were artificially fed. Of the 107 that were artificially fed 23 were so fed from birth, 8 before the end of the second week and 6 partly so fed before the end of the second weekIn more than one-third of the cases artificial feeding was begun before the end of the second week. Of the artificially fed children only 5 were registered before the end of second week, 16 before 4 weeks, and of the remaining 86, 50 were not registered until six weeks or more after birth. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. The last paragraph shows the need for the above Act and in previous reports I have advised the earlier registration of births. The Council adopted the above 15 Act on the 11th December, 1907. The Local Government Board afterwards consented to the adoption of the Act and fixed Monday, the 9th March, 1908 as the day on which the adoption came into operation. The Act provides:— "In the case of every child born in an area in which this Act is adopted it shall be the duty of the father of the Child, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, and of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of, or within six hours after the birth, to give notice in writing of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health of the District in which the child is born." Notice is to be given by posting a prepaid letter or post-card addressed to the Medical Officer of Health, Council Offices, 197, High Holborn, giving the necessary information of the birth within 36 hours after the birth, or by delivering a written notice of the birth at the Office of the Medical Officer of Health within the same term. The Council is to supply, without charge, addressed and stamped post-cards containing the form of notice to any Medical Practitioner or Midwife residing or practising in the Borough who applies for the same. Any person who fails to give notice of a birth in accordance with the Act will be liable to a penalty not exceeding 20s. The notification is in addition to, and not in substitution for, the requirements of any Act relating to the registration of births. The Act applies to any child which has issued forth from its mother after the expiration of the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy, whether alive or dead. MODIFIED MILK FOR INFANTS. In my Annual Report for 1906 I gave a detailed report respecting this matter, pointing out the large amount of preventable illness and the enormous sacrifice of infant life due to improper feeding, and that the provision of a Milk Depot in Holborn would be very costly. I, therefore, arranged with the Express Dairy Company, Limited, who have various Depots in and near the Borough to supply modified milk for infants of the working classes for about the same charges as at Municipal Milk Depots. The Company agreed to supply the modified milk at the reduced rate of 4d. per day on production of a certificate from me. These arrangements are becoming more known and more frequently used; in fact, during the year 64 certificates were issued. The certificates, however, were 16 only used for 48 infants. In the remaining cases the certificates, although issued, were not used for various reasons, several being on account of the death of the child, or removal to hospital, before the modified milk was obtained. In some of the cases the modified milk was, for various reasons, discontinued after using it for short periods, extending from a few days to three months, in 9 cases on account of change in the mothers' residence. Of the 48, 5 died; 1, age 2 months, from convulsions, after 9 days' use; 2, very small premature twins, after 1 month's use; 1, 7 months old, from measles, after nine weeks' use; 1, age 9 months, from convulsions, after 8½ months' use. In the majority of cases the mothers were very well satisfied, and the infants thrived well on the milk. Councillor W. Hazell, J.P., kindly offered to pay half cost of the milk in cases where the parents cannot afford to pay the whole amount. During the year there were 24 such cases, and 3 others in which the mothers were able to pay 3d. per day. SENILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of persons 65 years of age and upwards was in:— Bloomsbury and St. Giles 113 Holborn Sub-District 117 Holborn Borough 230 Bloomsbury and St. Giles. Holborn Sub-District. Total. Of these the numbers were— 65 years and under 70 33 38 71 70 „ „ 75 33 33 66 75 „ ,, 80 28 28 56 80 „ „ 85 13 13 26 85 „ „ 90 3 2 5 90 years of age — 1 1 91 1 12 92 „ 1 - I 94 „ _ 1 1 95 1 — 1 113 117 230 DEATHS FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The following tables give details respecting the number of deaths, and the deathrates, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz.:—Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup), Whooping Cough, lever 17 (including Enteric or Typhoid, Typhus and continued), and Diarrhoea. It will be seen that the number is only 71 in comparison with a decennial average of 116. The death-rate for the Borough was only 1.27 in comparison with 142 for London. Number. Zymotic Death-Rate.

Only 28 deaths were assigned to alcoholism or cirrhosis of liver, 17 in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 11 in the Holborn District. These represent only a portion of the deaths really caused by alcoholism as they are frequently registered under the headings of other secondary causes. 19 CANCER. Thirty-nine deaths were registered as due to cancer or malignant disease, 19 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 20 to the Holborn District. SUDDEN AND VIOLENT DEATHS.

The number of notifications of infectious diseases in the Borough during 1907 was again very small, and, excluding two notifications of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, was only 276, the same as the previous year, the decennial average being 470. During the past six years the notifications per 1,000 of the population have been less than for London, and last year were 5.0 per 1,000 in comparison with 8.6 for London. c 2 20 NOTIFICATIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE BOROUGH DURING 1907, AND DURING THE PRECEDING TEN YEARS.

SMALL POX. There was no notification of small-pox in the Borough during the year. SCARLET FEVER. During the 52 weeks ended Saturday, December 28th, 1907, the number of scarlet fever notifications, excluding duplicates, was 156, 58 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 98 to the Holborn District. In the St. Giles District 52 cases were removed to Hospital, and in the Holborn District 94. Three of the cases were nurses at one of the hospitals in the Borough. The number of notifications was only 2.8 per 1,000 in comparison with 5.4 for London. Secondary Cases of Scarlet Fever. Of the 156 notifications, 130 occurred at houses in which there was no secondary case. In six houses there were two cases, in one of which, the primary case occurred the preceding year. In five houses, including one Institution, there were three cases notified. 22 In the majority of instances, the secondary cases occurred because the primary case was isolated at home, or was not promptly notified and removed to hospital. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever. Of the secondary cases of scarlet fever, five were "Return" cases, i.e. cases which occurred in a house soon after the return home of a patient from hospital. These included two cases apparently infected by a patient who had returned home to a tenement on the same floor of a large block of dwellings, and had discharge from the ear. There had been no other case of scarlet fever either in the dwellings or at the school for many weeks. Errors in Diagnosis. During the year 13 patients were returned home from the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals reported as not suffering from scarlet fever; four of them on the same day or day following their admission, and the remainder at various periods from one to seven weeks. Recommendation for Local Government Board Inquiry respecting Scarlet Fever. At the latter end of the year, the Metropolitan Asylums Board passed the following resolution " That in view of the continued prevalence of scarlet fever, notwithstanding the extensive isolation accommodation which has been provided, the Local Government Board be asked to cause an inquiry to be instituted into the cause of this disease, and whether any, and if so, what further means can be adopted for its prevention.'' This resolution was approved by the Guardians of the Poor for St. Gilesin-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, and afterwards by our Council. There unfortunately has been an increased prevalence of scarlet fever during the past three years; the London rate per 1,000 having increased from 2.7 and 2.9 per 1,000 in the years 1903, 1904 respectively, to 4.2, 4.3 and 5.4 in the years 1905-6-7 respectively. I may, however, point out that these high rates have, during the past 18 years in which notification of infectious disease has been enforced, in the following years, been even higher, viz. :—8.4 in 1893, 6.4 in 1892, 5.8 in 1896, 5.1 in 1897, 4.5 in 1895 and 4.2 in 1894. In connection with this matter, I prepared the following statistics, dividing the 18 years into two equal periods of nine years :— 23 Cases notified per 1,000 of the Population. 9 years 1890-8 inclusive 4.94 9 years 1899-07 do. 3.83 That is a reduction of more than 22 per cent. of the former period. Mortality per cent, of Patients treated in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals. 9 years 1889-97 inclusive 6.3 per cent. 9 years 1898-1906 ,, 3.3 per cent. Reduction nearly half. Mortality Bate per 1,000 of the Population. 9 years 1889-97 inclusive 0.22 per 1,000 9 years 1898-1906 do. 0.10 per 1,000 Reduction more than half. These statistics are very satisfactory as to the mortality per centage of patients treated, and the mortality rate per 1,000 of the population, and show a fairly satisfactory reduction of the number of cases notified. Scarlet fever is certainly much less virulent than it used to be. The great majority of cases of recent years have been of a very mild type. I think isolation hospitals have probably tended to produce this diminished virulence, as the more severe cases have, for many years, been removed to hospital, and during recent years an increased number of mild cases also, so that only comparatively mild cases, and those which on that account have not even been diagnosed, and those in which a doctor was not called in, have been left to spread infection. I may also mention that many scientific researches have been conducted for the Local Government Board respecting the bacteriology etc., of scarlet fever, and the results have been published in the Annual Reports of the Medical Officer of the Board. Various expert inquiries, particularly respecting "Return " cases, have been made during recent years by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. It is desirable that such researches should be extended. I therefore quite agree with Dr. T. Orme Dudfield, the Medical Officer of Health for Kensington, that there is no cause for alarm, and I trust, should the Local Government Board decide to comply with the request of the Managers, that satisfactory results will be obtained. 24 DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of diphtheria notified was 64, of which 32 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 32 to the Holborn District. All but 9 patients were removed to hospital. The average number of notifications for the preceding decennium was 109, 35 for St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 74 for the Holborn District. Four of the cases were on the medical or nursing staff at one of the hospitals in the Borough. Secondary Cases. There were only four secondary cases all occurring within a few days of the primary case. Return Cases. There was no return case during the year. Errors in Diagnosis. Only two patients were returned from hospital as not suffering from diphtheria. One on the day following admission, and the other after an interval of about one month. ENTERIC FEVER. Excluding duplicates, there were only 14 notifications of enteric fever, in comparison with 15 the previous year; of which 6 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 8 to the Holborn District. The average number of notifications for the preceding decennium was 40; 23 in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 17 in the Holborn District. All the cases were removed to hospital. Of the 14 patients it was afterwards found that five were not suffering from enteric fever. Of the remaining nine at least three, contracted their illness when staying out of the Borough. Two of them, although living in different houses in the Borough, had been staying in the same house at Whitstable just before their illness. One patient was a servant at a hospital where there had been a case recently admitted, in which,the diagnosis was definitely confirmed by the Widal reaction. About the same time, a porter, who worked at the hospital, but lived out of the Borough, was removed to hospital. The Senior Physician of the hospital had a consultation with me, and we made careful inquiries respecting the matter. The general sanitary condition of the hospital was excellent. TYPHUS FEVER. One case of typhus fever occurred in the Borough, viz., a female, age 50, 25 There had been 110 typhus fever in the Borough since a case which occurred eleven years previously in 1896. I examined the patient with the doctor in attendance, and the diagnosis was afterwards confirmed at the South Western Hospital, to which the patient was removed. The illness began with vomiting after cleansing a foul w.c. A case had been notified in Stepney about three weeks previously, and in Islington about ten weeks previously, but although careful inquiries were made, I could not ascertain any connection with either of these cases. The patient lived with another woman, and there was no overcrowding as it was a large room; although it had two windows, it was rather badly lighted on account of close proximity to an opposite wall. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. The London County Council made an order, approved by the Local Government Board, that the above disease should be notifiable in London for six months from and including the 12th March, 1907, afterwards extended for a further period of eighteen months from and including the 13th September, 1907. Two cases were notified during the year. The first patient was an infant six months old, who had died before the notification wTas received. No bacteriological examination was made, and there was no post mortem examination. The second case was a child fourteen months old, who was removed to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street. I sawT the patient at the Hospital. The patient was then improving and afterwards recovered. I made very careful inquiries, but could not ascertain any source of infection in either case. In the latter case the patient lived in a tenement of the Bourne Estate Houses for the Working Classes. MEASLES. Measles was not so prevalent in the Borough as in the preceding year. We received information of only 144 cases in comparison with 370 in 1906. It was principally prevalent in the Borough during the months of February to June inclusive, and'October and November, and most cases died in the months of May and November. The schools principally affected were Princeton Street, St. Mary, Charing Cross Boad, Bosebery Avenue, St. John-tlie-Evangelist and St. Giles-in-theFields. Of the 144 cases reported on by the Lady Sanitary Inspector, 126 were attending school. Of the remaining 18, at least 10 cases were traced D 2 0 to school infection. Of 72 chidren under five years of age 54 were attending •school. In 35 of the cases there was no doctor in attendance, and 91 occurred in tenements of only one. or two rooms. Isolation was therefore practicably impossible in about two-thirds of the cases. There were only 13 deaths in comparison with 25 in the preceding year; of these only two belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 11 to the Holborn Sub-District. All were young children under five years of age. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping cough on the other hand was apparently more prevalent than during the preceding year, there having been 27 deaths in comparison with only 10 in 1906; 20 of the deaths were in the Holborn Sub-Division, and all but one of the deaths were children under five years of age. DIARRHEA. On account of the cold, showery summer there was very little prevalence •of diarrhoea during the year, the number of deaths having been only 16 in comparison with 39 in the preceding year, and a decennial average of 38. As desired by the Local Government Board, under the heading diarrhoea, as regards children under one year of age, all the deaths classified as diarrhoeal diseases in Table V. have been included. Of the 16 deaths, 6 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 10 to the Holborn Sub-District. All were children under five years of age, and all but one under one year of age. PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. The number of deaths from phthisis during the year 1907 was 125, equivalent to a death-rate of 2"28 per 1,000; of these 59 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, being a death-rate of 2-02 per 1,000, and 66 to the Holborn District, or a death-rate of 2-54 per 1,000. Of the 125 deaths, 28 were persons who had been removed to Infirmary from common lodging houses, 14 from each division. The corrected number of deaths in London was 6,654, the corresponding death-rate being 1 '40 per 1,000. The number of deaths from other tubercular diseases was 32; of these 12 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 20 to the Holborn District. The following table gives the number of deaths in the Holborn Borough, and the rate per 1,000 and the corresponding rate for Loudon for the ten years, 1898 to 1907, inclusive. 27 Year.

The Voluntary Notification of Consumption, which was in the first instance put into force for a period of 12 months from the 1st January, 1904, the fees to he paid being the same as for the notifiable diseases, was extended to the year 1905, and has since been further extended for the three years 1906 08. Excluding a few duplicates there were 171 cases notified, 74 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 97 to the Holborn District. The corresponding numbers for the year 1906 were respectively 191, 98 and 93. The cost of the notification was £10. 19s. Od. Of the 171 cases notified, 93 or 54 per cent., had been living in common lodging houses, and thess were all, at once or soon afterwards, removed to infirmaries. With a few exceptions the remaining 78 lived in tenement houses, and 59 of them were soon removed to infirmaries or hospitals, so that only 19 remained at home. In previous Annual Reports for 1904-5 I gave details as to the action that is taken and the various residts that were obtained from the enquiries made, and I think it is now unnecessary to repeat these. After death, or removal to infirmary or hospital, disinfection is advised. Consent for this was, however, obtained in only 86 cases. CONFERENCE ON THE PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION At a Conference of the representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, on the question of taking measures to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption), held at the Town Hall, Paddington, on the 6th .June, 1907, at which your delegates were the then Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor James Smith, the Vice-Chairman, Councillor The Eev^ Edward Canney, and the Medical Officer of Health, the following resolutions were passed:— D 2 28 That it is desirable that the notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis {Consumption) should be compulsory. That application be made to the Local Government Board for an order to be made—- (1.) To include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) among the diseases to be notified under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act1891 ; and (2.) To extend the provisions of the following Sections of the above Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption):— Section 60.—Cleansing and disinfecting of premises, etc. „ 61.—Disinfection of bedding, etc. „ 62.—Infectious rubbish thrown into ashpits to be disinfected. „ 63.—Penalty on letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging. „ 64.—Penalty on persons letting houses making false statements as to infectious disease. „ 65.—Penalty on ceasing to occupy house without disinfection or notice to owner, or making false answer. „ 69. —Prohibiting infectious persons carrying on business (in so far as it relates to the milking of cows and to the sale and distribution of milk). That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable, in order to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, provision should be made for public inspection and control at its several sources of the milk supply of England, and that the Local Government Board be asked to take steps to secure the efficient administration of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885, and Orders amending the same, by making compulsory regulations. That the provision conferred by Section 7 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, namely, that in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation maintained, be rigidly enforced, and a similar provision extended to all places where people are assembled together for any lengthened period, with a view to restricting the spread of pulmonary tul)erculosis. That a Sanatorium is needed for the open air treatment of poor persons. That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be the Central Authority for London and that the Local Government Board be requested to confer on, or if necessary to obtain for, the said Managers power to act in that capacity; and that they should be empowered to use for Sanatorium purposes the Southern Hospital recently erected by them at Carlshalton. 29 That this Conference appoint a Deputation to wait upon the Government to urge the desirability of their providing a sum of money annually for the erection and maintenance of suitable Sanatoria for the treatment of early cases of consumption. That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a Deputation from the Conference in support of the above resolutions and that he be urged to take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to them. ROYAL COMMISSION ON TUBERCULOSIS-HUMAN AND BOVINE. The Second Interim Eeport of the Eoyal Commission appointed to inquire into the relations of Human and Animal Tuberculosis was published in the early part of the year. In my Annual Eeport for last year I gave a summary of the principal results at which the Commission had already arrived, and I need not, therefore, repeat them. DISINFECTIONS.

As the Council s Shelter for the accommodation of persons during the disinfection of their houses at No. 191, High Holborn, was demolished in July, 1906, the Council made arrangements with the adjoining Borough of Finsbury for the use of their shelter. As the disinfectors work very early and very late, if required, it has not been necessary to use it. 30 BACTERIOLOGY.

Of the 266 persons, 221 had their bodies cleansed in the baths of the St. Giles and Bloomsbury Casual Wards in Goldsmith Street, and 1,456 articles were disinfected in the Council's steam appratus. The remaining 45 had their bodies cleansed in the baths of the Holborn Casual Wards, Little Gray's Inn Lane, and their 361 articles of clothing' disinfected in the steam apparatus at that Casual Ward. On account of the large number of persons applying in the latter part of 1905 the cleansing of persons had to be limited to those living in the Borough. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, powers are given for the compulsory cleansing of verminous children attending any of the Council's schools, and verminous inmates of any common lodging houses. HOUSINGJOF THE WORKING.CLASSES ACT, 1890 Action under Part I, of the Act. WARNER STREET (ITALIAN COLONY) AREA. Details of this area, which was represented by me in July 1901, were given in my Annual Report for that year. In successive Annual Reports I have given details of the few changes that had taken place in the area prior to 1906 and of the correspondence that had 31 taken place with the London County Council, the Home Office, the Local Government Board, and the principal freeholders respecting the matter. In my Annual Eeport last year, I gave details respecting the Local Government Board Inquiry, which was begun on the 12th June 1906, and was afterwards adjourned until June 25th, and again to October 15th, and then to April 15th, 1907. 1 also gave details respecting the condition of the area at the time of the Inquiry and the high death-rates. By April 15th, the day fixed for the adjourned meeting of the Local Government Board Inquiry, all the Courts had been closed and partly demolished, affording light, ventilation and air space. The underground rooms had been discontinued for living purposes, and the repairs, alterations and renovations agreed upon had been carried out. As a result, pending the promised further development of the area, a very considerable improvement has been made. UNION BUILDINGS AEEA. Aylesbury Place, Clerkenwell, and Union Buildings, Holborn, Improvement Scheme, 1899. Details of the action taken, and progress made each year, have been given in successive Annual Reports. The erection of houses for the working classes on the site of this area, which was begun in 1906, was continued during the year, and it is expected that they will be completed about the middle of 1908.

Bourne & Hollingsworth's Staff Premises. Wild Street, Boys' Home. WATER SUPPLY TO TENEMENT HOUSES- In accordance with Section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907 :— "For the purposes of Section 48 (provision as to houses without proper water supply) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a tenement house shall lie deemed to be a house without a proper and sufficient supply of water unless there shall be provided on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of each family occupying such house are situate a sufficient provision for the supply of water for domestic purposes : " Provided that with respect to any building existing and in use as a tenement house at the passing of this Act this section shall not come into operation until the 1st day of January, 1908." As recorded in previous Annual Reports, on account of the decision of the Magistrate at the Woolwich Police Court on the 16th December, 1904, to the effect that the supply of water from a tap in the yard is not a proper and sufficient supply of water to a tenement house within the meaning of Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a number of notices were served during the past few years for securing additional water supply. It was decided at first to serve statutory notices and take legal proceedings for tenement houses in which the only water supply was in the basement. I advised that legal proceedings should not be taken if additional water supply was provided about midway between the ground and top floor. E 2 36 BY-LAWS AS TO HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. At the end of the year 686 houses were registered under these by-laws. Of these, 361 are in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 325 in the Holborn Division. During the year a double house, Nos. 42 and 43, Great Saffron Hill, was added to the Register. During the year there were 1,325 inspections of these premises, excluding a very large number of periodical inspections and re-inspections. Eleven notices were served for 16 overcrowded rooms, and 275 notices for other breaches of the by-laws, exclusive of 672 notices that were served for annual cleansing as required by the by-laws. OVERCROWDING. The number of dwelling rooms found to be overcrowded was 44, in comparison with 60 in the previous year. Sixteen of these were dealt with as breaches of the By-Laws as to Houses Let in Lodgings. REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. In accordance with the contract all house refuse has to be removed during the months April to October inclusive, at least twice a week, and oftener if required by the Medical Officer of Health, and in the remaining months November to March, at least once in each week and oftener if required. In the main thoroughfares there is a daily collection. Although during the past three years the dust contract has been £800 per annum less than the preceding contract, the number of complaints from householders has very much diminished, especially during the past year. The Council has also effected a further saving of more than £200 per annum in salaries as the duties of the Dust Inspectors are now carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors. During the year 15,995 loads of house refuse were removed. During the year a number of applications were received for the removal of trade refuse for which the contractor is paid by the owners in accordance with section 33 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. REMOVAL OF MANURE. The removal of manure was again carried out satisfactorily, and for the first time no complaint was received during the year. Posters requiring the periodical removal of manure and other refuse matter from all stables, cowhouses, or other premises in the Borough not less frequently than every 48 hours were again posted in the various mews in the Borough. 37 COMMON LODGING HOUSES ACTS 1851 AND 1853. The Secretary of State by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of common lodging houses. The following is a list of the Common Lodging Houses registered in this Borough at the end of the year 1907 :— Of these 17 are in Bloomsbury and St. Giles for 1,273 lodgers. „ 8 „ Holborn District for 694 „ Total 25 in the Borough for 1,967 „ Bloomsbury and St. Giles.

During the year there were 79 inspections of factories, 988 inspections of workshops anil 2,270 of workplaces other than outworkers'premises. 280 Intimation Notices for sanitary defects were served and 29 Statutory Notices. There were also 195 inspections of home workers' premises for which 13 Intimation Notices for sanitary defects were served.

BAKEHOUSES. At the end of the year 1907, there were 34 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 17 were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 17 in the Holborn District. 39 The following is a list of the bakehouses in the Borough, all of which are underground except those marked * :— St. Giles and Bloomsbury. *2 Bloomsbury Court. 10 Bury Street. 166 Drury Lane. 155 High Holborn. *162 High Holborn. 217 & 218 High Holborn (Holborn Restaurant). 63 High Street. 19 Little Earl Street. 5 Little St. Andrew Street. 21 Marchmont Street. 77 Marchmont Street. 8 Museum Street. 60 Neal Street. 24, 26 and 28 New Oxford Street. 200 Shaftesbury Avenue. *88 Southampton Bow. 6 Torrington Place.

During the year, in addition to my inspections, there were 304 inspections of the above bakehouses, excluding 16 inspections of the factory bakehouses. HOME WORK. All the out-workers' premises were inspected at least once during the year by the Lady Sanitary Inspector, details of which are given in the table. Many of these inspections of home-workers' premises are also made during house to house and periodical inspections of lodging houses and dwelling houses in which homeworkers reside. On the 23rd May, 1907, the Home Secretary issued a new Order which extended the sections relating to lists of out-workers; to employment in unwholesome premises; and to the prohibition of home work in places where there is infectious disease, to the following classes of work :— The making of artificial flowers. The making of nets other than wire nets. The making of tents. 40 The making or repairing of sacks. The covering of racquet or tennis halls. Pea picking. Feather sorting. The carding, boxing or packeting of buttons, hooks and eyes, pins and hair pins. The making of baskets. Any processes incidental to the above. Further details respecting Factories, Workshops, Laundries, Workplaces and Home-work are given in Table IX. of the Appendix. INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN. On the 6th November last, a conference of representative of the Home Office and Medical Officers of Health was held at the Home Office to consider the question of further regulation of the industrial employment of women before and after childbirth. The present Factory and Workshop Act prohibits the employment of a woman or girl within four weeks after she has given birth to a child. Further regulation was recommended by the Physical Deterioration Committee in 1904, and the Conference on Infantile Mortality in 1906. The latter Conference resolved (1) the extension of the period from one month to three months, (2) the prohibition of the employment of women advanced in pregnancy unless medically certified as fit for work. It appeared to the Secretary of State that a simultaneous and systematic enquiry into the subject, on uniform lines by the Medical Officers of Health of a number of representative industrial centres would yield the best results. The Holborn Borough Council approved of my co-operation and my attendance at the Conference at which the details of the form which the inquiry should take were agreed to. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. Under this head are included kitchens of hotels, restaurants and eating-houses of all sorts, slaughter-houses, tripe, offal and other meat shops, fried fish, eel and other fish shops, premises where ice cream is made, and other places where food is prepared for sale, excluding bakehouses which are given on previous page. The number of these places on the register at the end of 1907 was 359; 1,994 inspections were made, and 78 notices were served during the year for sanitary defects found. 41 In addition to the above inspections of places where food is prepared for sale, there were also 711 inspections of market streets, each of which includes a number of stalls at which meat, fish, fruit and vegetables are sold. These streets are also regularly inspected on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings. SLAUGHTER-HOUSE. There is now only one slaughter-house in the Borough, viz., No. 29, Bed Lion Street, which, in addition to my inspections, was inspected on 16 occasions during the year, and one notice was served for sanitary defects found. The Council decided to take no further action respecting the opposing of the renewal of the license. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. The number of registered dairies and inilkshops in the Borough at the end of the year was 178, of which 76 were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 102 in the Holborn District. During the year 18 dairies and inilkshops were newly registered, 11 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 7 to the Holborn District. On application for registration under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, the premises were also carefully inspected by me, and notices served to remedy any sanitary defects. In addition to my inspections the Sanitary Inspectors made 878 inspections of these premises, and 10 notices were served for sanitary defects or breaches of regulations. There is now only one cowshed in the Borough, which is No. 4, Goldsmith Street, and was frequently inspected during the year, and three notices were served for sanitary defects or breaches of regulations. ICE CREAM. At the end of the year there were 41 premises in the Borough where ice cream was manufactured or sold, and 118 inspections of these premises were made and two notices were served for sanitary defects. As ice cream is often made in the early morning inspections, between 6 and 9 a.m. were also occasionally made in order to ascertain whether there were any infringements of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. F 42 UNSOUND FOOD. Applications were received for removal and destruction as trade refuse of the following articles of food, all of which were unsound and unfit for the food of man:— 1 barrel Pig's Heads. 1,765 crates Bananas. 5 boxes Kippers. 251 bundles Tomatoes. 2 hampers Mushrooms. 11 boxes Apples. 26 crates Potatoes. During the year there were two seizures, one of a quantity of unsound beef and mutton, the defendant being convicted and fined £10 and £5. 5s. costs ; and the other a forequarter of tubercular pork, the defendant being convicted and fined £10. SMOKE ABATEMENT. The smoke shafts in the Borough were frequently kept under observation, and in 104 cases the inspections were recorded. 13 intimation notices and 3 statutory notices were served. For further details of Sanitary Work and Legal Proceedings see Tables VI., VII., VIII, IX., X. and XI. METEOROLOGY. The mean temperature of the year was 49'7 degrees, which is 04 degrees lower than for the preceding 65 years. The rainfall was 22.25 inches, and was 1.87 inches below the average for the preceding 65 years. In the year 1903 there was the large amount of 35.54 inches. The total amount of bright sunshine recorded was 1,417 hours, out of a total possible 4,458 hours, and it was 85 hours below the average for the preceding 10 years. Further details are given in Table XII. In conclusion, I desire to express my appreciation of the excellent assistance and hearty co-operation that I have received from the staff of the Public Health Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant. W. A. BOND. Public Health Department, 197, High Holborn, W.C. 43 APPENDIX. TABLE I.
