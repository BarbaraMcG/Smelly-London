Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Fortieth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of St. Paneras. The map upon the front page shows the Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras. The Statistics of populations, births and deaths, relating to the SubDistricts, refer to the areas as shown upon this map. The rise in the death-rate for the year was due mainly to the rise in the number of deaths under 1 year of age and from 1 to 5 years, and this was increased by the number of deaths from measles, diarrhoea, and dysentery, partly accounted for by the hot summer. There was also a rise in the number of deaths from respiratory diseases at all ages, due to the extremely long and cold winter of 1894-95. On the other hand there was a fall in the number of cases of dangerous infectious diseases notified during the year. In that part of this Report dealing with Infectious Diseases will be found some statistics of Diphtheria incidence in London Districts, a summary of opinion upon the anti-toxin treatment in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and an account of the accommodation for Diphtheria in general and special hospitals in and near St. Paneras. In Part IV., Sanitation, under the head of Staff, will be found a table of the number and proportion of Sanitary Inspectors in each of the London Districts. The law with regard to the open space required about buildings. Some paragraphs summarising the position of the schemes for the insanitary areas. A list of the schools in St. Paneras and of those visited by the Health Committee of View. The powers and duties of your Vestry as to workshops. The difficulties of, and remedies for combined drainage. The powers of your Vestry as to the removal of domestic refuse. Under the head of Food, a summary of the arguments for and against private and public slaughter-houses is introduced. Part VI., Legislation, embraces an account of the Bye-laws enforceable by your Vestry under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. As in previous years, it is desirable to commence the Report with a summary of the principal meteorological data of the year. 10 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1895. Barometer. Temperature.

As in previous Reports the population of St. Pancras is regarded as stationary, and after correction and re-distribution is estimated as follows:— Regent's Park Sub-District 37471 Tottenham Court „ 26509 Gray's Inn Lane „ 28028 Somers Town 33545 Camden Town ,, 14344 Kentish Town „ 96535 St. Pancras District 236432 Due to the many changes that have taken place in Somers Town, it is highly probable that the above estimate is more or less unreliable, but there is no means of adjusting the distribution of population in the Sub-Districts, at this distance of time since the census. MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during the year was 2243, being 178 more than in the previous year, and 132 more than the annual average of the previous ten years. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year was 7099, being 164 more than in the preceding year, and 124 less than the annual average during the preceding decennium. The 237 births in public institutions having been re-distributed according to population, the number of births and the birth-rate of each of the SubDistricts and of the District were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number of Births. Birth-rate. Regent's Park 1,060 28.3 Tottenham Court 669 26.4 Gray's Inn Lane 903 33.7 Somers Town 1,059 33.1 Camden Town 484 33.7 Kentish Town 2,924 30.3 St. Paneras 7,099 30.0 London 133,715 30.5 13 DEATHS. During the year the corrected total number of deaths from all causes at all ages was 4794, being 511 more than during the preceding year, and 62 below the annual average of the preceding ten years. Per 1000 of population, the death-rate was 20.3, compared with 18.1 in the previous year, and an annual average of 20.5 in the preceding decennium. The total number of deaths and the death-rates in the Sub-Districts are set out below, 163 deaths from all causes not referable to any particular SubDistricts being distributed according to population:— Sub-Districts.

In Table 8 in a similar manner the deaths from the non-notifiable "principal zymotic diseases" will be found set out. From these two Tables the mortality of the respective diseases, and of each of the groups, have been obtained. 15 The Notifiable Infectious Diseases.—The number of deaths from this group of diseases in the Sub-Districts, and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths were as follows:— Sub-Districts.

Puerperal Fever accounts for 12 deaths, as against 7, 12, and 12 in the three years before; and Erysipelas for 11 deaths, compared to the numbers in the three previous years of 15, 36, and 9. Table 5a shows that Measles caused 217 deaths, compared to 86, 149, and 229 ; that Whooping Cough caused 86, as against 111, 103, and 147; and Diarrhoea and Dysentery were the cause of 218, as compared to 105, 188, and 139 in the three preceding years. Phthisis.—This disease, the type of the tubercular group of diseases, was the cause of 431 deaths, compared to 457 in 1894, and 458 in each of the two years previous to that. The incidence of this disease in the Sub-Districts was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population.

The accompanying table shows the number of deaths annually, at various ages and at all ages, since the first epidemic in 1889. From this it will be seen that 1891 and 1892 were the worst years, and that last year was not far behind; this was, no doubt, attributable to the severe winter. ST. PANCRAS.

Due to the unreliability of the estimate of population in the Sub-Districts it might be misleading to draw any definite conclusions The most reliable figures, namely the deaths under one year per 1,000 births, show Gray's Inn Lane sub-district to have the highest and Kentish Town the lowest infantile mortality, but Somers Town shows the highest mortality for Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea, essentially diseases of childhood. 1895.

Amongst other things it was shown that the death-rate from Diphtheria per million living per annum in all London in 1891 was 340, in 1892 was 462, that in 1893 it suddenly leaped up to 760, a truly epidemic year, in 1894 it fell to 614, and now in 1895 it has further fallen to 529. In the Registrar General's Annual Summary the deaths from Diphtheria in each of the Metropolitan Sanitary Areas in each of the nine years 1887 to 25 1895, after distribution of deaths occurring in public institutions, are set out in a table lettered D, In this table it is clearly apparent that, whereas in most of the northern, central, eastern, and southern districts of the Metropolis the maximum annual mortality occurs in the maximum epidemic year 1893, in none of the western districts did the mortality reach its maximum in that year, in fact the maximum of the western districts occur s irregularly in various years before and subsequent to 1893. The deaths for the nine years in each of the Sanitary Districts in the Registrar General's table mentioned above have been totalled, and the annual means found and are set out in the accompanying table in this Report. The Census of 1891 was enumerated at the beginning of the second quarter of that year, and as the end of the second quarter of that year was also the middle period of the years 1887 to 1895, it has been thought desirable for purposes of accurate comparison to take the Census population as the basis for calculating the death-rates of the sanitary areas. Furthermore, as nearly the whole of the deaths occur under 15 years of age the death-rates have also been calculated upon the census number of population below that age in 1891, so as to eliminate as far as possible from the death-rates the influence of age distribution of population. The results, taking the groups of districts, are as follows:— Groups of Sanitary Areas. Enumerated Population, Census, 1891. Deaths. Mean Annual Death-rate per 1,000 of Population. At all Ages. Under 15 yrs. Totals, 1887—1895. Annual Mean, 1887—1895. At all Ages. Under 15yrs.

In the former only the east group is above the mean of London, and the order from maximum to minimum mortality is east, south, west, central, north. In the latter, not only is east group largely above the mean of London but also the west considerably, and the central slightly, and the order from maximum to minimum is east, west, central, north, south. The remarkable difference between the results of the two columns in the case of the south group of districts is particularly striking, "at all ages" its death-rate stands highest but one, whereas under 15 years of age it stands lowest. It is probable that the second column of death-rates is nearer the truth for comparative purposes. † Note.—In reference to the population of the groups of sanitary districts. According to registration districts, the population of the west group of registration districts at the census of 1891 was 740,735, and of the central 247,538, the difference of 12,317 at all ages (4614 under 15 years) between these numbers and those of the groups of sanitary districts, is due to the fact that the Parish of St. Anne's, Soho, is included in the sanitary area of St. James', Westminster, which is in the west group, instead of that of the Strand, which is in the central group. But this does not affect the figures of the table. There is also a population of 1,852 persons at all ages, and 305 under 15 years, not included in any sanitary area, but belonging to certain inns of court and other liberties: this population does not appear in the total in the table. 26 Deaths from Diphtheria in the Metropolitan Sanitary Areas in the Nine Years, 1887 to 1895, after Distribution of Deaths occurring in Hospitals.

St. Martin's in the Fields, and St. Giles in the Central Group are also high, and so is Paddington in the Western Group. To what extent these differences are due to schools, social conditions, and the influence of hospital isolation it is difficult to gauge. Anti-toxin in Diphtheria. — Recently a Seport, issued by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, has been made by the Medical Superintendents upon the use of anti-toxic serum in the treatment of Diphtheria in the Hospitals of the Board during the year 1895. The experience of treatment by serum injection extends over 2,182 cases, and the report is of a satisfactory character, the unanimous opinion of the six Medical Superintendents being that " in anti-toxic serum we possess a remedy of distinctly greater value in the treatment of Diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted." The summaries of the effects and of the results of the treatment are so clear and comprehensible that by quoting them in extenso the best idea of the effects and results will be gathered. Certain effects have been observed clinically to follow the administration of anti-toxin in cases brought under treatment at a reasonably early date, they are:— (i.) A diminution of the faucial swelling and consequent distress. (ii.) A lessening, if not an entire cessation, of the irritating and offensive discharge from the nose. (iii). A limitation of the extension of membrane. (iv.) An earlier separation of the exudation. (v.) A limitation and earlier separation of membrane in laryngeal cases. (vi.) An improvement in the general condition and aspect of the patients. (vii.) A prolongation of life, in cases which terminate fatally, to an extent not obtained with former methods of treatment. (viii.) No constant or important effect upon either the temperature or pulse rate is attributable to anti-toxin. The improved results in the diphtheria cases treated during the year 1895 are:— (i.) A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first and second day of illness. (ii.) The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. (iii.) The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. (iv.) The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate Hospital. (v.) The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. 29 Measles.—Towards the end of the year, an epidemic of Measles made its appearance in the District, and subsequently, I made a report to your Health Committee upon the notification of this disease, the arguments for and against which are here summarised. ' A.—The arguments in favour of the notification of measles are:— (1) Measles causes a larger number of deaths than any other zymotic disease, excepting whooping cough and diarrhoea. (2) It is highly infectious, and the infectiousness continues after the appearance of the rash, and until the branny desquamation ceases. (3) It is largely spread through the medium of schools, and it is too late to close schools after the disease has obtained the hold shown by the death returns. (4) The protection of schools and the prevention of epidemics would be furthered by enabling infected children to be detained at home, and by affording earlier opportunity to send printed and other instructions for dealing with the disease and preventing its spread. (5) Notification would enable isolation in hospital and disinfection of the dwelling-room, &c., to be carried out. This would (a) check the spread of the disease, (b) tend to reduce the virulence of the disease by improving the surroundings, and (c) diminish the fatality by improved treatment, and (d) as measles only lasts half as long as scarlet fever, twice the number of patients could be treated in the same number of beds. B.—The arguments against the notification of measles are: — (1) The maximum mortality of the disease is during the second year of age, rapidly diminishing though childhood till it becomes insignificant, although this may be due to acquired immunity, but the fatality averages only about 5 per cent. of cases. (2) The disease is infectious before the characteristic rash appears, and during the corhyzal stage. (3) It mainly prevails among children before school age, and becomes more or less epidemic every other year, with extended epidemics every few years. (4) In the majority of cases medical advice is not sought; these cases would therefore not be medically certified, and, if notified by parents and guardians, medical examination would have to be compulsorily enforced to verify the fact. (5) Admitting that (a) isolation checks the spread, not only of measles, but also of even the most benign communicable ailments, (b) improved surroundings reduce the virulence of all diseases, and (c) improved treatment reduces the fatality of all diseases, and that all these are desirable aims; still the great objection to notification is that (d) effective measures of isolation in hospital and disinfection 30 of the dwelling-rooms, &c., cannot be carried out, because of the large amount of accommodation required. Assuming the fatality of measles cases to be 5 per cent. (the Edinburgh experience varied between 1.5 per cent. and 5.9 per cent. of notified cases), 20 cases for every death registered would have to be provided for. The number of beds would have to be more numerous than for scarlet fever, because the number of deaths from measles is greater; and, although the disease only lasts half as long as scarlet fever, the fatality is less than half as great. The provision of hospital accommodation, and disinfection at public expense, would entail a heavy expenditure. The annual average number of deaths from measles in London for the ten years, 1884-1893, was 2,634, representing, with a fatality of 5 per cent., 52,680 cases, assuming that a half, or 50 per cent. only of these cases went to hospital, and that they remained one month, then 2,200 beds would be required. In case of epidemic at least another thousand beds would be required. For every additional 10 per cent. (over the assumed 50 per cent.) that would go to hospital 440 additional beds would be required. So that at least 3,000 beds would require to be installed and reserved, if hospital accommodation were provided for measles. The numbers I have taken in this estimate are low, and below the probable total rather than above it. ISOLATION.

A circular was sent which elicited replies to the following effect:— University College Hospital, Gower Street. Seven beds are reserved for Diphtheria cases, but only patients requiring tracheotomy are admitted. Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road. No beds are set apart, but urgent cases requiring tracheotomy are admitted to an isolation ward. Temperance Hospital, Hampstead Road. Cases requiring tracheotomy are admitted to isolation ward. North-West London Hospital, Kentish Town Road. No accommodation. New Hospital for Women, Euston Road. No accommodation. Central London Throat and Ear Hospital, Gray's Inn Road. (No answer.) Middlesex Hospital, Goodge Street, W. No accommodation. Charing Cross Hospital, W.C. No special beds, but cases are admitted when tracheotomy is urgently required. King's College Hospital, Lincoln's Inn, W.C. Infectious cases to the number of twelve are admitted on payment of a guinea a week towards maintenance. French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, W.C. No accommodation. Great Northern Central Hospital, Holloway Road, N. Urgent cases are received provided there is room, in small special wards and two isolation wards, each containing one bed. Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, W.C. Twelve beds are set apart for Diphtheria, eight for acute cases, and four serving as a convalescent ward. Samaritan Free Hospital for Women, Marylebone Road, N.W. No accommodation. London Throat Hospital, Great Portland Street, W. (No answer.) Hospital for Diseases of the Throat, Golden Square, W. No accommodation. Hospital Accommodation for Infectious Diseases Generally.—On Tuesday, December 3rd, a Conference of Delegates of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, invited by the Vestry of St. Marylebone, was held at the Court House, Marylebone, W., to consider the position of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in regard to its inability to provide sufficient accommodation for the infectious sick, and to discuss the following, among other points:— 32 (a) The desirability (or otherwise) of the Metropolitan Asylums Board providing temporary and immediate accommodation in the form of iron and wood buildings, for such of the infectious sick, if any, as cannot be accommodated in the existing hospitals. (b) The desirability (or otherwise) of recouping to a Parish the expenditure entailed upon it in consequence of making provisions for such of its infectious sick as cannot be accommodated in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. (c) The desirability (or otherwise) of members of the Metropolitan Asylums Board being elected by the Ratepayers direct. (d) The desirability (or otherwise) of the Metropolitan Asylums Board being constituted an independent Authority. The following resolutions were submitted to and considered by the Meeting:— 1.—That in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should have power, in times of emergency, to provide temporary accommodation for such of the infectious sick, if any, as cannot be accommodated in existing permanent hospitals. 2.—That in the opinion of this Conference, the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be empowered and required to recoup to any Parish the expense entailed upon it in consequence of making provision for such of its infectious sick as cannot be accommodated in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 3.—That in the opinion of this Conference, the Authorities making the Rate to raise the funds for the requirements of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be entitled to be directly and adequately represented upon that Board. 4.—That in the opinion of this Conference, the Members of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be elected by the Ratepayers direct. After a full discussion, the following resolutions were carried:— 1.—That a communication be addressed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, strongly urging that Board to take steps to immediately open the vacant beds of the Gore Farm Hospital, at Darenth, for the purpose of providing the temporary accommodation required by the London Local Authorities for the cases of Scarlet Fever urgently requiring removal from the crowded families and houses in which they are spreading the disease. 2.—That in the opinion of this Conference, the Authorities making the Rate to raise the Funds for the requirements of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be entitled to be directly and adequately represented upon that Board. 3.—That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation in support of the foregoing Resolutions. 33 4.—That a copy of the foregoing Resolutions be forwarded to the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis who have appointed Delegates to attend this Conference, and that each of those Vestries and District Boards be asked to appoint one Representative to attend the proposed deputation to the President of the Local Government Board. Subsequently on the 11th December, upon the recommendation of the Health Committee, your Vestry resolved— (а) That the Local Government Board be asked to hold an Inquiry and take evidence as to the present administration of the Metropolitan Asylums Board ; such Inquiry also to include its constitution, mode of election and scope of duties, its largely increasing yearly expenditure, and its failure to provide for the requirements of the Local Sanitary Authorities. (b) That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, urging each of them to send a similar representation to the Local Government Board.

But this is not so satisfactory a method of comparison as that in which the population is taken as a basis, because the houses vary so much in size, and the method of estimating their number differs according to the definition and interpretation of "a house." According to population, a more reliable method of comparison, St. Pancras stands thirty-fifth on the list and ninth from the bottom of the list of the fortythree Districts in the County of London. St. Pancras has, with ten Sanitary Inspectors, one Inspector for every 24,163 inhabitants, the mean in the whole of the County of London, being one Inspector for every 18,787 inhabitants, equal to an average of one-fourth more Inspectorial Staff than in St. Pancras. The minimum number of Inspectors within the county of London is in the hamlet of Mile End Old Town, one per 36,203 inhabitants, and the maximum number (excluding the city where the day population is so large, and the night so small) is in the District of St. Martinin-the-Fields, one per 6,560.

Towards the end of the year also Mr. Johnson resigned, having been elected to a post in the City, and Mr. Bush was appointed in November in his stead. The unfortunate death of Mr. Evans, in January, led to the appointment of Mr. Kershaw in March, 1896. OPEN SPACES.

The provisions are contained in the London Building Act, 1894, mainly in Part V. of the Act. The first clause (section thirty-nine) in Part V., provides that public buildings, buildings of the warehouse class, and buildings used as offices are excluded from the Act. Section forty provides that all new domestic buildings with habitable basements shall have at the rear an open space of at least one hundred square feet free from any erection thereon. The words "above the level of the adjoining pavement" must be interpreted to mean the pavement of the yard or external surface adjoining the basement floor, to make the section comprehensible. By the next section (forty-one) it is provided that new buildings in new streets shall have at the rear an open space of not less than one hundred and fifty square feet, free from any erection thereon, except a water-closet and dust-bin. Excepting that where one hundred square feet, as provided by the 41 previous section, sufficiently light and ventilate the basement, the rest of the open space may be covered in up to the level of the ceiling of the ground storey. And, also excepting that where there is no basement storey, and the ground storey is not intended for habitation, the space may be entirely covered in to the level of the ceiling of the ground storey. The open space must extend along the entire rear front of the building to a depth of at least ten feet. Then follow rules for limiting the height of buildings in relation to the space in the rear. The principle upon which these rules are based being that no part of the building shall extend above an imaginary "diagonal line" drawn from the rear boundary of the site at ground level in the direction of and over the premises at an angle of 63½ degrees to the horizontal, or 26½ degrees to the perpendioular. This means that the height of a new building must not exceed twice the width of the open space exclusively belonging to it at the rear, so that in the case of a double row of houses the open space between them at the rear will equal the height of the houses, just as the width of the street in front will be equal to (or greater than) the height of the houses on either side in streets less than fifty feet wide laid out since 1862. The foregoing applies to new domestic buildings in new streets. In old streets the " diagonal line," instead of starting at ground level from the rear boundary, starts sixteen feet above ground level, and below this sixteen-feet line the open space may be covered in. Section forty-two lays down certain rules with reference to the provision of open space about artizans dwelling houses not on the public way, the London County Council have power to approve or disapprove of the amount of open space provided in the plans of such buildings. In sub-section two of the previous section there is also an important provision in reference to open space about new dwelling houses to be occupied by the working classes, these buildings, even when abutting on old streets, being required to have an open space provided of not less than one hundred and fifty square feet, to extend along the entire rear front to a depth of at least ten feet, and any structure but a water-closet and dust-bin being prohibited from erection thereon. By section forty-three new domestic buildings on old sites (except dwelling houses for the working classes) may occupy the same area of land as the old buildings, but no more, and will have to conform to the requirements as to the angle limiting the height. By section forty-four the Council may relax the foregoing provisions in the case of new streets on old areas. Section forty-five requires the provision of a horizontal opening at the bottom of every shaft or court open at the top, but enclosed on every side by domestic buildings. It also enacts that no habitable rooms, required to be solely lighted from such an enclosed shaft or court, shall be constructed in any buildings if the wall of the shaft opposite the window exceed in height twice the width of the court. It further enacts that in a shaft or court enclosed only on three sides, the width of which is less than one-half the depth, no habitable room (above the ground floor) required to be solely lighted from such a shaft or court shall be constructed in any building, unless the wall of the shaft opposite 42 the window be less in height than twice the width of the court. This will improve the spaces provided at the rear, and in the return angles of both mansion flats and artizans' blocks of dwellings. The Superintending Architect may determine which is the front or rear of a building by the next section. By section forty-seven, the height of absolutely new buildings is restricted to eighty feet, but the height of artizans' dwellings is limited to the width of the street by sub-section five of section thirteen of the Act. Section 13 (5) * * * * * Provided always that no dwelling-house to be inhabited, or adapted to be inhabited, by persons of the working classes shall, without the consent of the Council, be erected or re-erected within the prescribed distance to a height exceeding the distance of the front or nearest external wall of such building from the opposite side of such street, and that no building or structure shall be converted into such dwelling-house within the prescribed distance so as to exceed such height: In the next section is set forth the procedure to be adopted when the Council gives special consent to the erection of buildings of a greater height than eighty feet. Section forty-nine re-enacts that no building in any street less than fifty feet wide laid out subsequent to August, 1862, shall exceed the width of the street in height. It is permitted by the fiftieth section to raise the top storey of any building in order to increase the height of the rooms in conformity with section seventy of this Act—quoted later on in the report. It must be mentioned here that it is permitted to construct the roof of any building, except of the warehouse class, so as to incline at an angle of seventy-five degrees with the horizontal, that is falling back at an angle of only fifteen degrees from the perpendicular [Section 61 (4)], and two stories may be constructed in the roof of a domestic building [Section 62 (1)]. Section fifty-one permits the re-erection of artizans' dwellings belonging to a local authority on the same site and of the original dimensions. Section fifty-two is a saving clause for domestic buildings with stables in the rear, if the depth of the site be less than one hundred and fifty feet, and the stables less than twenty-five feet high, they may be treated as one building under Section forty-one of the Act, with regard to the required open space. This concludes Part V., and it will be observed that the provisions as to open space about buildings apply solely to domestic buildings. Now domestic buildings do not include public buildings, nor buildings of the warehouse class ; these are defined in section 5, sub-sections (27) and (28). 27. The expression "public building" means a building used, or constructed, or adapted to be used, as a church, chapel, or other place of public worship; or as a school, college, or place of instruction (not merely a dwelling-house so used); or as a hospital, workhouse, public theatre, public hall, public concert-room, public ball-room, public lecture-room, public library, or public exhibition-room; or as a public place of assembly; or used, or constructed, 43 or adapted to be used for any other public purpose; also a building used, or constructed, or adapted to be used as an hotel, lodging-house, home, refuge, or shelter, where such building extends to more than 250,000 cubic feet, or has sleeping accommodation for more than 100 persons. 28. The expression "building of the warehouse class" means a warehouse, factory, manufactory, brewery, or distillery, and any other building exceeding in cubical extent 150,000 cubic feet, which is neither a public building, nor a domestic building. So that it is not compulsory to provide any open space for exclusive use for new buildings, including day-schools, hospitals, factories, workshops. This is to be regretted, as it is extremely difficult to construct a proper and secure system of drainage, or to provide for the storage of refuse, without at least a modicum of open space attached to the building. In order to he complete it is desirable to quote two further Sections of the Act, relating to the ventilation of staircases in dwelling-houses the height, lighting, and ventilation of habitable rooms, and the ventilation below basement floors. 69. (1) In every building constructed or adapted to be occupied in separate tenements by more than two families, the principal staircase used by the several families in common shall be ventilated upon every storey above the ground storey by means of windows or skylights opening directly into the external air, or shall be otherwise adequately ventilated. (2) The principal staircase in every building, being a dwelling-house, and not subject to the provisions of sub-section 1 of this scction, shall be ventilated by means of a window or skylight opening directly into the external air. 70. 1 (a) Every habitable room, except rooms wholly or partly in the roof, shall be in every part at least 8 feet 6 inches in height from the floor to the ceiling. (b) Every habitable room, except rooms wholly or partly in the roof, shall be at least 8 feet in height from the floor to the ceiling, throughout not less than one half the area of such room. (c) Every habitable room shall have one or more windows opening directly into the external air, or into a conservatory, with a total superficies clear of the sash frames, free from any obstruction to the light, equal to at least one tenth of the floor area of the room, and so constructed that a portion equal to at least one twentieth of such floor area can be opened, and the opening in each case shall extend to at least 7 feet above the floor level; but a room having no external wall, or a room constructed wholly or partially in the roof, may be lighted through the roof by a dormer window with a total superficies, clear of the sash frames, free from any obstruction to the light, equal to at least one twelfth of the floor area of the room, and so constructed that a portion of such window equal to at least one twenty-fourth of such floor area can be opened, and the opening in each case shall extend to at least 5 feet above the floor level; or such room may be lighted by a lantern light, of which a portion equal to at least one twentieth of the floor area can be opened. 44 (d) In a building, being a dwelling-house, every basement room having a wooden floor. other than a floor constructed of solid wood bedded on concrete, shall have a sufficient space between the ground and floor surfaces to admit of ventilation by means of air bricks or otherwise. (e) Every habitable room constructed over a stable shall be separated from the stable by a floor which shall have in every part not occupied by a joist or girder, a layer of concrete plugging of good quality, or of other solid construction, 3 inches in thickness, finished smooth upon the upper surface and properly supported; and the under side of such floor shall be ceiled with lath and plaster of good quality, or of other solid construction. Any staircase or gallery or structure by which such rooms shall be approached shall be separated from any stable to which it may adjoin by a brick wall not less than 9 inches in thickness. (f) Nothing in this Act shall affect, alter, or repeal any of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to underground rooms. 2. If any person knowingly suffer any room, constructed after the commencement of this Act, that is not constructed in conformity with this section, to be inhabited, he shall, in addition to any other liabilities to which he may be subject, be liable to a penalty for every day during which such room is inhabited. The foregoing explains the present requirements in regard to air-space, ventilation, and light, the three important sanitary factors in the Building Act. DWELLINGS. House-to-House Inspections.—The number of streets inspected from houseto-house during the year was part of 2, consisting of 39 houses, all occupied, 315 rooms, all occupied, containing 92 families, consisting of 227 adults and 31 children under 10 years. 42 notices were served upon these houses. Houses occupied in separate Dwellings.—A. list of blocks of houses constructed and let in separate and self-contained dwellings is appended to the end of the Report (List 1). There are also a number of blocks of houses let in separate dwellings not self-contained, and a still larger number of houses not constructed in blocks, and let in separate dwellings not self-contained. Registered Tenement Houses.—The number of houses let in separate dwellings to members of more than one family, and registered under the Byelaws, is 126. Registered Common Lodging Houses.—The supervision of these houses is now in the hands of the London County Council. A list of those in St. Pancras will be found appended to the Report (List 2). Underground Dwellings.—18 underground rooms were closed against occupation as separate dwellings. Canal Boats used as Dwellings.—Canal boats were inspected periodically, and found in a satisfactory condition. 45 UNHEALTHY DWELLING HOUSES.

Somers Town Area.—This area is now on the way to be dealt with. In the Annual Report for the year 1893 it was stated that the Arbitrator appointed by the Home Secretary divided the area into three parts—that north of Drummond Street, that west of Chalton Street, and that East of Chalton Street. The Area North of Drummond Street has been dealt with and materially improved by your Vestry, as described in the Annual Report for 1894. The Area West of Chalton Street is now being taken in hand by a scheme of the London County Council, known as the London (Churchway, St. Pancras) Improvement Scheme, 1895, made under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, at a total estimated cost of £51,650. The scheme deals with the houses in Churchway, Wellesley Street, Elizabeth Court and York Buildings, and provides for the formation of a 40feet road along the existing line of Churchway, widening on its western side from Grafton Place to Drummond Street, and thereby opening up three cul de sacs, viz., Grafton Place, Wellesley Street, and Lancing Street, into each other. By the Improvement Scheme the proposed 40-feet road along the existing, line of Churchway is to terminate at and continue into Grafton Place instead of continuing through into Euston Road. Your Vestry, being of opinion that it is highly desirable that the proposed road should be made to communicate direct into the Euston Road, and that the Council should be approached with a view to the inclusion into the Improvement Scheme of the three houses in Euston Road abutting upon the entrance to Churchway from Euston Road, resolved that the London County Council be approached with a view to urging upon that body the desirableness of amending the London (Churchway, St. Pancras) Improvement Scheme, 1895, so as to continue the proposed 40-feet road direct into Euston Road, instead of as proposed into Grafton Place, and that the Council be further urged to acquire the houses Nos. 146, 148 and 150, Euston Road. The Home Secretary appointed H. T. Steward, Esq., to hold an Inquiry at the Vestry Hall on the 27th and 28th February, 1896, concerning the Churchway Scheme of the London County Council, which as at present shown will be the creation of a large cul de sac in one part of Somers Town Area, which will be entirely shut off from the other part, and also from every thoroughfare except Seymour Street. Your Yestry were of opinion that this cul de sac should be opened up to light and air, traffic and frontage, in such a manner as to be easily accessible from the other parts of the locality; and being further of opinion that without this provision the Scheme of the Council is incomplete, instructions were given for Counsel to be retained on behalf of the Vestry, to attend the Inquiry and urge the amendment of the Scheme in accordance with these views. No opposition was offered to the Scheme. On behalf of the Vestry, Mr. Corrie Grant used his best endeavours to obtain the extension of the new Street to be formed on the site through into the Euston Road. The Commissioner ruled that this could not be held to be part of the Inquiry ; the 47 suggestion of the Vestry, however, was strongly supported by evidence given by one of the Witnesses called on behalf of the Council, and there is a prospect of the houses in Euston Road being acquired at the joint expense of the Council and your Yestry for the purpose of continuing the new Street into the Euston Road. The Area East of Chalton Street is still under consideration, and a Scheme has been adopted by your Vestry. Brantome Place Area.—A Scheme for dealing with this area has been adopted, and an enquiry will be held in due course. Prospect Terrace Area.—Similarly a Scheme for this area has been adopted and will be inquired into as provided by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. SCHOOLS.

In June, 1895, I furnished a Report upon the powers and duties of your Vestry with regard to workshops under the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878,1883, and 1891, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In February, 1896, I furnished a further Report mainly in reference to further powers and duties under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1895 50 To briefly summarise the material points, the Factory and Workshops Acts are now administrated partly by the Home Office, through H.M. Chief and District Inspectors of Factories, and partly by Sanitary Authorities, through Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors. Factories fall entirely under the supervision of the former; and workshops, as to their sanitary condition, under the control of the latter. There are also a considerable number of sections in the Acts that are impersonal, and under which legal proceedings may be taken by persons aggrieved. For the practical purposes of Sanitary Authorities, and without entering into definitions of textile and non-textile factories, it is sufficient to say broadly that the use of steam, water, or any other form of mechanical power for manufacture in any workshop or workplace converts it into a factory under the supervision of the Home Office. As to workshops, which may be wholesale, retail, or sub-contracting, these are of three kinds:— (1) Those in which protected persons are employed, i.e., a child under fourteen years, a young person over fourteen and under eighteen years, and a woman over eighteen years of age. (2) Those in which protected persons are not employed; and— (3) Domestic workshops, i.e., where members of the family are employed at home. The occupier of every factory and workshop, whether protected persons are employed or not, is required to give notice within one month of the commencement of occupation to the Factory Inspector of the district; and the occupier of every workshop already in occupation is required to give similar notice within the year 1896. These notices as to workshops are to be forthwith forwarded by the Inspector of Factories to the Sanitary Authority of the district. The lists of outworkers kept at factories and workshops afford further information, and in addition to these, the complaints received, and a systematic inspection of the district, will bring to light many workplaces. By means of these forms of information registers are being compiled for permanent reference. It is to be presumed that some widely-circulated public announcement will issue from the Home Office, calling the attention of occupiers of workshops to the requirement to give notice before the termination of the year 1896, and that Sanitary Authorities will, in due course, receive the notices relating to workshops. It is the duty of a Sanitary Authority to see, with regard to every workshop within its district, 1. That it is kept in a cleanly state. 2. That it is kept free from effluvia arising from any drain, closet, urinal, &c. 3. That it is ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the work carried on therein. 4. That it is free from overcrowdiug—that is, that at least two hundred and fifty cubic feet of space per head are provided during ordinary working hours, and four hundred cubic feet during overtime. 51 5. That the prescribed notice specifying the number of persons who may be employed in each room is duly affixed at the entrance to the workshop, or that the fact is otherwise made known. 6. That a reasonable temperature is maintained in each workroom. 7. That it is limewashed, cleansed, or purified, when necessary for health, as certified by an officer of the Sanitary Authority—bakehouses being excepted and otherwise provided for. 8. That it is provided with sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences for each sex. 9. That note is made of the employment of protected persons, in order that the Factory Inspector may be informed. 10. That the list of outworkers is inspected. In the case of any act, neglect, or default punishable or remediable under the law relating to public health in a factory or a workshop coming to the knowledge of a Factory Inspector, he is required to give notice thereof to the Sanitary Authority of the district in writing. Thereupon it is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to take action within one month, and to inform the Inspector of the proceedings taken. If no proceedings are taken the Factory Inspector is empowered to take like proceedings, and to recover the cost from the Sanitary Authority. Furthermore, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the provisions of the law relating to public health are not being observed in any workshops of a district, or in any particular class of workshops, he may, by order, direct a Factory Inspector to enforce the provisions, and take proceedings, and recover the cost from the Sanitary Authority. In addition to the ordinary requirements for a workshop already enumerated, it is also the duty of a Sanitary Authority, with regard to every bakehouse within its district, to see:— 1. That the inside walls, ceilings, &c., are (a) either painted or varnished every seven years and washed every six months, or are (b) limewashed every six months. 2. That a sleeping place is effectually separated from any bakehouse in the same building, and is lighted and ventilated by an external window at least nine feet square, one-half being made to open. 3. That a bakehouse cistern is separate and distinct from any water-closet cistern. 4. That any water-closet, earth-closet, privy, or ashpit is cut off from direct communication with a bakehouse. 5. That no drain or pipe for carrying off fœcal or sewage matter has an opening in the bakehouse. 6. That no bakehouse is in such a state as to be, on sanitary grounds, unfit for use as a bakehouse. 7. That no underground bakehouse is newly brought into use. 52 The sanitary provisions, the affixing of notices and abstracts, notice of occupation, and other provisions of the Acts, now apply to laundries of certain public institutions, domestic laundries, and laundries where not more than two non-residents are employed. Of a laundry there is no definition in the Acts, but in common acceptation it is a place where clothes are washed and dressed. Here, in addition to the necessary points applicable to all workshops, special attention requires to be directed to prevent nuisances from excessive heat in ironing-rooms, and from accumulation and condensation of steam in washhouses, from noxious fumes of gas, irons, and of stoves for heating irons, and from bad flooring and draining of the surface. By Sec. 22 (2) of the Act of 1895, in laundries which are factories, a fan or other proper appliance is compulsory in every ironing room to regulate the temperature, and in every washhouse to carry away the steam, but these and other compulsory powers in this section are not given to Sanitary Authorities for the control of laundries which are workshops. By section 27 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1891, it was provided that the occupier of every factory and workshop and every contractor employed by such occupier shall, if required by order of the Secretary of State, keep a list of all persons employed, either as workmen or as contractor, outside the factory or workshop, and of the places where they are employed, such list to be open to inspection by any Factory Inspector or Officer of a Sanitary Authority. In November, 1892, the Secretary of State made such an order with regard to the manufacture of wearing apparel, electro-plate and files, cabinet and furniture making, and upholstery work. By section 42 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1895, it was further provided that the lists described in section 27 of the Act of 1891 shall be sent, on the 1st of March and the 1st of September in each year, to the Factory Inspector of the District, and it was also provided that section 27 of the Act of 1891 shall (by statute) apply to any place from which any work of making wearing apparel for sale is given out, as if that place were a workshop. That is to say, it now applies also to shops where no work is actually done, but where work is given out to be done upon wearing apparel. It is to be observed that the lists relating purely to shops, workshops, and the out-workers and contractors employed in making wearing apparel are to be sent to the Factory Inspector of the District, and no provision is made for sending them to the Sanitary Authority. With reference to the relationship of the Sanitary Authority to the Inspector of Factories, by section 26 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1891, notices of the opening of new workshops, and by section 41 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1895, notices of the occupation of existing workshops must be sent to the Inspector of Factories, and by him forwarded forthwith to the Sanitary Authority of the district. On the other hand, by section 27 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, if the Medical Officer of Health becomes aware of any child, young person, or woman, being employed in a workshop, he must forthwith give notice of the fact to the Factory Inspector of the District. Presumably, also, although the Acts do not so specify, he will notify to the Factory Inspector of the District those workshops (excepting domestic workshops) where the Abstract and Notices prescribed by the Secretary of State are not affixed, especially the notice specifying the number of persons who may be employed in each room of 53 workshop premises. Otherwise it will be difficult for the Sanitary Authority to control overcrowding, and in reference to this control, it is within the power of an Inspector of Factories, but not within the power of a Sanitary Authority's Officer, to direct that a notice shall be affixed in each workroom as to the number of persons that may occupy it, in addition to the notice required by Statute to be affixed at the entrance to the premises. Section 29 of the Act of 1895 provides that any case of lead, phosphorus, or arsenical poisoning, and of anthrax, contracted in any factory or workshop, shall be notified by the medical attendant to the Chief Inspector of Factories; that written notice of the case shall then be sent to the Factory Inspector and to the Certifying Surgeon, and be regarded as an accident, of which the latter is required to investigate the nature and cause. This entirely new departure in the notification of disease will be carefully watched both by the public and the medical profession. Washing conveniences are also now required to be provided where lead, arsenic, or other poisonous substances are used in any factory or workshop. Further, the occupier of a factory or workshop is not allowed to employ any woman within four weeks after childbirth. And, to complete the matter, an occupier of a factory or workshop is liable to pay penal compensation to any person suffering injury to health directly attributable to his neglect to observe any provision of the Acts, or any special rule or requirement made under Section 8 of the Act of 1891. The Act of 1895 also provides that the occupier of any place were wearing apparel is made, cleaned, or repaired, or where it is given out for these purposes, or any sub-contractor of the occupier, is liable to a maximum penalty of ten pounds, if he allows any wearing apparel to be made, cleaned, or repaired in any dwelling house or building occupied therewith, whilst any inmate is, to his reasonable knowledge, suffering from scarlet fever or the small-pox. This will apply to tailoring, dressmaking, millinery, etc., as well as to laundrying, mangling, etc. It is rarely that an employer knows anything of the health of other persons residing in the same houses as his employees. He can only know of small-pox or scarlet fever if he be informed by his employee, or by the Sanitary Authority, whose Officer again would in turn have to be informed by the employee of the name and address of the emplover, and there is no compulsion to disclose this, so that the working of this section must depend mainly upon the goodwill of the employee, to whom no provision of compensation for loss of employment is made. As Medical Officers of Health are notified of all cases of scarlet fever and small-pox, what is really required is to give specific power to Sanitary Authorities to enforce removal to hospital of any cases of scarlet fever or small-pox occurring in any house where wearing apparel continues to be made, cleaned, or repaired. The last point is that Sanitary Authorities (in London, the County Council) are required to furnish to factories employing more than forty persons certificates that they are provided with means of escape in case of fire, and to enforce such provision for means of escape. It is impossible to refrain from expressing the hope that the complications and cross references of factory and workshop legislation may, at no distant date, be reduced to a simpler and less complex form by re-codification. 54 Inspection.—Towards the end of the year 1895 your Vestry appointed a male and a female Sanitary Inspector, specially authorised to inspect workshops. The duties have been so divided that workshops where men are mainly employed, and bakehouses, fall to the male inspector, and workshops where women and young persons are mainly employed, and laundries, fall to the female inspector. The abatement of smoke nuisances also pertains to these officers, since Sanitary Authorities are empowered to suppress smoke nuisances and noxious effluvia arising from both factories and workshops. The Health Department is now in possession of a separate and complete Register of Bakehouses in St. Pancras, containing full particulars. A separate Register on similar lines is being prepared for Laundries. General Registers of other workplaces, where males and where females are mainly employed are also being compiled. Bakehouses.—A complete list of bakehouses in St. Pancras in occupation on January 1st, 1896, is appended to this report. It is to be noted that about 20 per cent. are at or above ground level, and that about 80 per cent. are below ground level, about 15 per cent. being under seven feet, and about 6.5 per cent. being over seven feet below ground level. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERYICE. During the year the dissatisfaction with the result of the so-called two gallon flush for water closets has increased. Recently an inquiry has been held by the Local Government Board, but this is matter that more properly belongs to the year 1896, to be reported upon at a future date. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. House Drains.—During the year, 1,944 house drains were tested, 156 repaired, 119 trapped, 322 ventilated, 224 disconnected from the sewer, 61 reconstructed, 471 new provided, and 7 cesspools abolished. Combined Drainage.—The question of combined drainage is a very serious one for Sanitary Authorities and Ratepayers as every combined drain is now understood to be a sewer maintainable at public expense. There is no doubt that when the legislature fifty years ago defined a "drain" as meaning a drain used for the drainage of one building only, it had in mind to throw upon Public Authorities the maintenance of the brooks, ditches, and open and closed channels used in common by a number of houses, but it never occurred to anyone then how easy it would be to convert the drain of every private house into a sewer, and this position was never contemplated in the definition made by Parliament. At present it appears that the law is that every drain of a single private house which carries even a little surface water from next door becomes a sewer, maintainable by the Sanitary Authority. Many such trivial alterations have been made in house drains, and have converted them into sewers. The only means of preventing such sewers being made at all, and of proving that Sanitary Authorities are not liable for them if made surreptitiously, is for the Sanitary Authority to produce the plans of the drains of premises. The 55 Legislature has thrown upon Sanitary Authorities the onus to prove that a drain of a private house carrying drainage from beyond the premises was and is a drain and not a sewer, but the Legislature has never given Sanitary Authorities the only means of proof, namely, that of enforcing the provision of a plan of the drainage of the premises, so that at the present moment Sanitary Authorities are paying very heavily for the oversight of the Legislature, and it is only equitable that the peccant Legislature should relieve Sanitary Authorities from the false position into which they have been led. For this purpose a Bill is now before Parliament, and as it is short it may be quoted in cxtenso with advantage. A Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Act with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, as follows:— 1.—In the construction of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, the word "drain" shall be deemed to apply to and include the subject matter specified in the 250th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and in the 112th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, and also any drain, whether constructed before the 1st January, 1856, or subsequently, which has not been approved as a sewer by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, or under Section 69 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and Section 45 of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, or under Sections 47 and 48 of the latter Act. 2.—Any Local Authority may recover any expenses incurred by them in cleansing, repairing or replacing any drain for draining any group or block of houses, from the Owner or Owners of any premises for the drainage of which such drain is or may be used in such proportions; if there be more than one Owner, as may be settled by the Surveyor of the Local Authority, or in case of dispute by the London County Council. Any such expenses may be recovered snmmarily in the same manner as the expense of making and paving new streets are authorised to be recovered under the Metropolis Management Acts. Metropolis Management Acts Amendment. *For the purpose of examining any such drain, or of doing any work necessary for the cleansing, repair, or replacing of any such drain, a Local Authority or their Surveyor or Inspector, or such other person as they appoint, shall have the like powers as are contained in Section 82 of the Metropolis Management Act of 1855 in regard to drains. *It is suggested the words in italics are unnecessary, having regard to the fact that Section 82 of the Act, 1855, is still in force with regard to drain and sewer. 56 3.—This Act shall not apply to any expenses incurred by a Local Authority before the passing thereof, but shall apply to the expenses incurred after the passing thereof in the case of any drain for draining any group or block of houses, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. 4.—The expression "Local Authority," as used in this Act, means any Vestry or District Board acting under the Metropolis Management Acts, and includes the Woolwich Local Board. 5.—This Act maybe cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1895, and shall be construed as with the Metropolis Management Acts. Plans.— In connection with the supervision of House Drainage, some statutory power should be obtained for demanding plans, to place on permanent record the course of House Drainage, as this is necessarily hidden under-ground and is not open to inspection or exposed a-s above-ground drainage work. The troubles that have arisen with regard to combined drainage might never have arisen if proper notice and plans of House Drainage had hitherto been enforceable. Although there is no statutory power for enforcing the provision of plans, Builders have in recent years found it more expensive to work without plans, approved beforehand, than with them, so that they have in all cases, almost without exception, provided plans in order to avoid calling into action the undoubted statutory power of the Vestry, to cause them to remove or undo any work that they may have done which is not approved in accordance with the Regulations and Directions; and furthermore the advantages to owners and occupiers of property of being able at any time to refer to the Vestry's records of plans of House Drainage must be taken into consideration. In selling, letting, or hiring houses or parts of houses, this must be of great benefit, and must be of still greater benefit in saving expense and time that would be otherwise entailed in excavating and tracing the course of underground drainage, in case of repairs or amendments, without a plan for guidance. AVith these facts in mind, your Vestry urged the London County Council to take such steps as may be necessary for promoting legal provisions to the following effect, namely: — (a) Before making any drain and before relaying, reconstructing, or amending the same, notice in writing shall be given to the Vestry , or District Board by the person intending to make such drain. (b) Before making any drain, or altering the level or course of or making any addition to or extending or curtailing any existing drain or any branch drain, a plan of the proposed drain and any existing drain shall be deposited with the Vestry or District Board by the person intending to make such drain or to alter or amend any existing drain. Copies of these resolutions, and the reasons for their recommendation, were sent to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, urging them to send similar recommendations to the London County Council, and nineteen Sanitary Authorities took similar action to your Vestry. 57 REFUSE REMOVAL. In the Annual Report for the year 1894 it was pointed out that the liability of this authority with regard to the removal of dust was contained in Section 30 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (1) "It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority (a) To secure the due removal at proper periods of house refuse from premises, and the due cleansing out and emptying at proper periods of ash-pits, and of earth-closets, privies and cesspools (if any) in the district, and the giving of sufficient notice of the time appointed for such removal, cleansing out and emptying, and (b) Where the house refuse is not removed from any premises in the district at the ordinary period, or any ash-pit, earth-closet, privy or cesspool in or under any building in the district is not cleansed out at the ordinary period, and the occupier of the premises serves on the Authority a written notice requiring the removal of such refuse, or the cleansing out or emptying of the ash-pit, earth-closet, privy, or cesspool, as the case may be, to comply with such notice within forty-eight hours after that service, exclusive of Sundays and public holidays. (2) If a Sanitary Authority fail, without reasonable cause, to comply with this section, they shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds. (3) If any person in the employ of the Sanitary Authority, or of any Contractor with the Sanitary Authority, demands from an occupier or his servant any fee or gratuity for removing any house refuse from any premises, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings. It was pointed out that the ordinary period mentioned in the above Section 30 (1) (b) is that named in Bye-Law 7 of the Bye-Laws of the London County Council, under Section 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as to the removal and disposal of refuse. "The Sanitary Authority shall cause to be removed not less frequently than once in every week the house refuse produced on all premises within their district." It was also pointed out that the duty of allowing house refuse t.o be removed every week fell upon the occupier, and the duty is contained in Section 126 of the Metropolis Local Management Act. "Any occupier of any house or land, or other person, who refuses or does not permit any soil, dirt, ashes or filth to be taken away by the scavengers appointed by or contracting with any Yestry or Board, as aforesaid, who obstructs the said scavengers in the performance of their duty, shall for every such offence forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding £5." On referring to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the 4th Schedule, amongst the sections of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, which are repealed, is included "section 126, as from the coming into operation of any Bye-Law made for the like object." It is further provided in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 142 (4), "Any enactment expressed in the fourth schedule to this Act to be repealed as from the coming into operation of any Bye-Law made for the like object, shall, although no such Bye-Law is made, be repealed on the expiration of twelve months next after the commencement of this Act, or 58 such later day, not exceeding eighteen months from such commencement, as may be fixed by Order in Council." I am informed by the Medical Officer of Health that the Council has made no Bye-Law dealing with refusal to allow the removal of dust, being of the opinion that Section 116 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, gives the Sanitary Authority all necessary power. Section 116 (1), is as follows:—"If any person (a) wilfully obstructs any member or officer of a Sanitary Authority, or any person duly employed in the execution of this Act, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Five Pounds."By Section 31 of the same Act it is enacted, "Every Sanitary Authority shall employ a sufficient number of scavengers, or contract with any scavengers, whether a Company or individuals, for the execution of the duties of the Sanitary Authority under this Act with respect to the sweeping and cleansing of the several streets within their district, and the collection and removal of street refuse and house refuse, and the cleansing out and emptying of ash-pits, earth-closets, privies, and cesspools." It is quite clear from this that the scavengers or dustmen who are employed by the Contractors on behalf of the Sanitary Authority are persons duly employed in the execution of this Act, so that any person refusing to allow the scavengers or other persons employed by the Contractors in the collection of house refuse to remove the refuse when called upon is guilty of obstruction under Section 116 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and liable to a fine not exceeding £5 accordingly. Complaints.—The following are the number of Dust Complaints received each quarter during the past five years. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1st Quarter 6812 8404 49 16 141 2nd ,, †5170 *1867 60 152 172 3rd ,, 3092 26 2 45 57 4th „ 3571 38 11 11 55 Totals , 18,645 10,335 122 224 425 †Transferred. * New system introduced. The complaints are due to the neglect of the dustmen to call at the proper weekly period, and hence are most numerous towards the end of the first quarter and at the commencement of the second quarter, when the contracts change hands. In case of complaint a special default cart is at once sent, and the extra cost is defrayed by the defaulting contractor. The relative efficiency of the contractors may be judged by the number of complaints, as the system of dust collection registers automatically. 59 Dust Complaints Registered.

Regent's Canal.—Since the diversion of the drainage of the Zoological Gardens from the canal into the main sewers of the district, and the removal of a large amount of deposit from the waterway, lay-byes, docks, and basins of the canal, uo complaints have been received of nuisances from this source. General Nuisances.—A large number of nuisances have been dealt with in the course of the year, and an enumeration of the requirements made to abate them will be found in Table 10a in the Appendix.

Y.—FOOD. FOOD PREMISES. The Licensed slaughter-houses, cow-sheds, and dairies have been regularly inspected. The bakehouses were also inspected twice during the year, and the necessary cleansing enforced. From time to time fish-frying shops and marine stores have been inspected. The markets and market streets were kept under observation daily, and also on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Slaughter-houses.—In the month of March I presented a Report upon Private and Public Slaughter-houses, setting out their advantages and disadvantages respectively, which may again be briefly referred to. One-fourth of our meat supply is imported dead, and altogether escapes inspection before and during slaughter, and seeing the rapid rate at which importation is increasing, it will probably not be many years before one-half of our meat supply will be imported dead. It may safely be said that with the imposition of every additional restriction upon home grown and home killed meat, an additional impetus will be given to the importation of dead meat. Therefore it behoves us to move charily, or it may be found that in endeavouring to increase supervision over live and dead meat we may be actually diminishing it, and we may find ourselves committed to eating meat slaughtered in a manner that we know not of and in a state of health of which we cannot, judge. For unless an animal is seen alive and the internal organs examined during slaughtering, it is difficult and often impossible to judge of the presence of disease, especially tuberculosis. The question is, should slaughter-houses be owned and maintained by private traders or by public authorities ? This again resolves itself into the question whether slaughter-houses should exist singly and scattered or combined and centralized. There is not the slightest doubt that by combination far better premises can be erected remote from dwelling houses and containing improved lairs, slaughter-chambers, and cold stores with refrigerating apparatus, than can generally be provided by individual effort. It is highly improbable that most butchers possessing private slaughter-houses would voluntarily incur this expense. In London, there are about 650 slaughter-houses, and from 1500 to 2000 butchers, so that two out of every three butchers are without slaughterhouses, and the licensing of a slaughter-house must put a valuable premium upon a butcher's premises. But, it is somewhat surprising that butchers not possessing slaughter-houses should not have combined before now, either to construct premises or to urge upon public authorities to construct them. There are at the Metropolitan Cattle Market in the York Road, N., some dozen or more slaughter-houses provided, in connection with the market, by the Corporation of the City of London. But the market does not strike an observer as being crowded, and although all the slaughter-houses are occupied there does not appear to be any extra demand. Nevertheless, there may be, and probably is, a desire amongst the many butchers without slaughterhouses to have the use of convenient, well-equipped premises, especially if constructed and maintained at public expense. There is here an opportunity of providing accommodation, without necessarily threatening those who 62 possess slaughter-houses to immediately abolish their private premises, and to compel them to use public buildings. Not that all private slaughterhouses are structures to be desire!, many are objectionable in construction and situation; on the other hand, there exist some to which less objection can be raised. There is room at the present moment, no doubt, for increased stringency in the conditions for the use of slaughter-houses, especially when situated in crowded neighbourhoods, in immediate proximity to dwellings, sometimes under houses or parts of houses, and occasionally below ground level, and with sharp descents,—a stiffening of the structural requirements might be made with advantage. So far as cleanliness is concerned there is as a rule little to choose between private and public slaughter-houses; in the former the less slaughtering makes it easy to keep the places clean, in the latter the greater amount of slaughtering requires much greater labour to maintain cleanliness, and this labour is accordingly provided on a larger scale. But scattered private slaughter-houses largely increase the difficulties of supervision and inspection of the slaughtering of animals and of the condition of the meat, and one of the main objects of centralising slaughter-houses is to secure more complete supervision and inspection of meat. Now and then suspicious looking meat is met with that probably has formed part of an animal slaughtered in a private slaughter-house that would not have passed muster if the animal had been examined before, and the internal organs examined during, slaughtering. Tuberculous cows are sometimes disposed of in this manner, and seeing the number of cows in cowsheds that shew signs of tuberculosis, these animals should be subjected to regular periodical veterinary inspection and examination, with the object of preventing not only the distribution of tuberculous milk but also the distribution of tuberculous meat. But it would be of little use carrying out such inspection in London alone unless it were extended to the country generally. This is an urgently needed general reform. It cannot be denied that the driving of animals through crowded thoroughfares to private slaughter-houses is very objectionable on various grounds. One effect of centralizing slaughter-houses and especially of placing them contiguous to railway stations is to prevent the driving of animals through the streets. To briefly summarise the points, the combination and centralisation of slaughter-houses at the principal Railway depots, would (A) on the one hand, 1.—Enable better and more fully equipped buildings to be provided, more or less remote from dwelling-houses. 2.— Prevent the necessity for driving animals through crowded thoroughfares to the place of slaughter, and 3.—Greatly facilitate the supervision and inspection of animals and meat before, during, and after slaughter, and (B) On the other hand, it is urged by the cattle and meat trade that it might tend to— 63 1.—Raise the price of meat if greater expenses were incurred by butchers. 2.—Drive the control of the trade by centralisation into the hands of a few large firms of middlemen. 3.—Increase the importation of dead meat, which would escape all efficient supervision.

VI.—LEGISLATION. The only measure of sanitary import passed during the year was an Act to amend the law relating to factories and workshops, and the provisions of this Act have been mentioned already under the head of Workshops in an earlier part of this Report. Bye-laws.—A Report issued by the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council in December, l985, sets out the Bye-laws and Regulations made by London Sanitary Authorities under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The position of St. Pancras in the matter may be placed on record here. London Sanitary Authorities have the power to make certain Bye-laws and Regulations, the Bye-laws are either obligatory or permissive, and the Regulations are permissive. It is obligatory on a Sanitary Authority to make, and St. Pancras has made the Bye-laws referred to under the following Sections of the Public Health (London) Act, l891:— " Section 16.—(1.) Every Sanitary Authority shall make Bye-laws— "(a) For the prevention of nuisances arising from any snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, rubbish, offal, carrion, fish, or filth, or any other matter or thing in any street; and "(b) For preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughterhouse, knacker's yard, butcher's or fishmonger's shop, or dunghill, into any uncovered place, whether or not surrounded by a wall or fence; and ''(c) For the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health ; and "(d) As to the paving of yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling-houses." "Section 39.—(2.) Every Sanitary Authority shall make Bye-laws with respect to the keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action." "Section 50.—Every Sanitary Authority shall make Bye-laws for securing the cleanliness and freedom from pollution of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man." "Section 94.— Every Sanitary Authority shall make and enforce such Bye-laws as are requisite for the following matters (that is to say): "(a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house, or part of a house, which is let in lodgings or occupied by members 67 of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied ; "(b) For the registration of houses so let or occupied; "(c) For the inspection of such houses; " (d) For enforcing drainage of such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation of such houses; " (e) For the cleansing and lime washing, at stated times, of the premises; "(f) For the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease." It is permissive for a Sanitary Authority to make Bye-laws under the following Sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and St. Pancras has made Bye-laws as to Mortuaries. "Sec. 45 —(1.) (a) Where a Sanitary Authority provide and maintain any public lavatories, ash-pits, or sanitary conveniences, such authority may make Bye-laws as to the decent conduct of persons using the same." "Sec. 66.—(3.) Any Sanitary Authority may make Bye-laws for removing to any hospital to which that Authority are entitled to remove patients, and for keeping in that hospital as long as may be necessary, any persons brought within their district by any vessel, who are infected with a dangerous infectious disease." "Sec. 88.—Every Sanitary Authority shall provide and fit up a proper place for the reception of dead bodies before interment (in this Act called a Mortuary), and may make Bye-laws with respect to the management and charges for the use of the same." "Sec. 95. —A Sanitary Authority may make Bye-laws for promoting cleanliness in, and the habitable condition of tents, vans, sheds, and similar structures used for human habitation, and for preventing the spread of infectious disease by the persons inhabiting the same, and generally for the prevention of nuisances in connection with the same." It is permissive for a Sanitary Authority to make Regulations under the following Sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and St. Pancras has made Regulations under Sec. 90.—(1.). "Sec. 45.— (1.) (a) Where a Sanitary Authority provide and maintain any public lavatories, ash-pits, or sanitary conveniences, such Authority may make regulations with respect to the management thereof." "Sec. 90.—(1.) Any Sanitary Authority may, and if required by the County Council shall, provide and maintain a proper building (otherwise than at a Workhouse) for the reception of dead bodies during the time required to conduct any post-mortem examination ordered by a Coroner or other constituted Authority, and may make regulations with respect to the management of such building." 69 It is obligatory upon the 'County Council to make Bye-lawn, and Bye-laws have been made, under tlie following Sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 : — "16.—(2.) The County Council shall make Bye-laws — "(a) For prescribing the times for the removal or carriage by road or water of any fcecal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, and providing that the carriage or vessel used therefor shall be properly constructed and covered so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid, and as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom ; and "(b) As to the closing and filling up of cesspools and privies, and as to the removal and disposal of refuse, and as to the duties of the occupier of any premises in connection with house refuse, so as to facilitate the removal of it by the scavengers of the Sanitary Authority. "(3.) It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority to observe and enforce any Bye-laws made under this Section." "39.—(1.) The County Council shall make Bye laws with respect to water-closets, earth-closets, privies, ash-pits, cesspools and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. "(3.) It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority to observe and enforce the Bye-laws under this Section; and any directions given by the Sanitary Authority under this Act shall be in accordance with the said Bye-laws, and so far as they are not so in accordance shall be void." All Bye-laws are subject to the following Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. "114.—All Bye-laws made by the County Council or by any Sanitary Authority under this Act shall be made subject and according to the provisions with respect to Bye-laws contained in sections one hundred and eightytwo to one hundred and eighty-six of the Public Health Act, 1875, and set forth in the First Schedule to this Act, and those sections shall apply in like manner as if the County Council or Sanitary Authority were a Local Authority. "Provided that the County Council, in making any Bye-laws which will have to be observed and enforced by any Sanitary Authority, shall consider any representations made to the Council by that Authority, and not less than two months before applying to the Local Government Board for the confirmation of any such Bye-laws shall send a copy of the proposed Bye-laws to every such Authority." 69 Public Health Act, 1875, Relating to Bye-laws. "182.—All Bye-laws made by a Local Authority under and for the purposes of this Act shall he under their common seal, and any such Bye-law may be altered or repealed by a subsequent Bye-law made pursuant to the provisions of this Act, provided that no Bye-hiw made under this Act by a Local Auihority shall be of any effect if repugnant to the laws of England or to the provisions of this Act." "183.—Any Local Authority may, by any Bye-laws made by them under this Act, impose on offenders against the same such reasonable penalties as they think fit, not exceeding the sum of five pounds for each offence, and in the case of a continuing offence a further penalty not exceeding forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Local Authority, but all such Bye-laws imposing any penalty shall be so framed as to allow of the recovery of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty." "184.—Bye-laws made by a Local Authority under this Act shall not take effect unless and until they have been submitted to and confirmed by, the Local Government Board, which Board is hereby empowered to allow or disallow the same as it may think proper, nor shall any such Bye-laws be confirmed— "Unless notice of intention to apply for confirmation of the same has been given in one or more of the local newspapers circulated within the district to which such Bye-laws relate, one month at least before the making of such application, and "Unless for one month at least before any such application a copy of the proposed Bye-laws has been kept at the office of the Local Authority and has been open during office hours thereat to the inspection of the ratepayers of the district to which such Bye-laws relate, without fee or reward. "The Clerk of the Local Authority shall, on the application of any such ratepayer, furnish him with a copy of such proposed Bye-laws or any part thereof, on payment of sixpence for every hundred words contained in such copy. "A Bye-law required to be confirmed by the Local Government Board shall not require confirmation, allowance, or approval by any other Authority." "185.—All Bye-laws made by a Local Authority under this Act, or for purposes the same as, or similar to, those of this Act under any Local Act, shall be printed and hung up in the office of such Authority; and a copy thereof shall be delivered *to any ratepayer of the district to which such Byelaws relate, on his application for the same." "186.—A copy of any Bye-laws made under this Act by a Local Authority, signed and certified by the Clerk of such Authority to be a true copy and to have been duly confirmed, shall be evidence, until the contrary is proved, in all legal proceedings of the due making, confirmation, and existence of such Bye-laws without further or other proof." 70 SPECIAL REPORTS. In addition to weekly, monthly and quarterly reports, and reports upon various minor matters, special reports upon the following subjects have been printed and presented:— Private and Public Slaughterhouses and Abattoirs—March, 1895. The Provision of Open Space about Buildings, and the London Build ings Act of 1894—May, 1895. The Inspection of Workshops—June, 1895, and a Supplementary Report upon the Factory and Workshops Act of 1895—February, 1896.
