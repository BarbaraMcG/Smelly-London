January,1943. To THE WORSHIPFUL, THE PORT OP LONDON HEALTH COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit ray Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Circular 2768 of the Ministry of Health dated 15th February,1943, states - "I am directed by the Minister of Health to refer to Circular 1937 of the 11th January,1940, and to request that the Authority will instruct their Medical Officer of Health to prepare his report for 1942, on the lines indicated in that Circular, and that two copies of the report may be forwarded to this Department not later than the 31st March, 1943". One hundred and ninety-six cases of Infectious Disease were reported as having occurred on vessels during the voyage of which 46 were landed in the Port, Twenty-four cases, particulars of which are given in Appendix II (b), were admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospitals. The Port Isolation Hospital at Denton was closed on the 26.10.40 and arrangements were made for the reception of cases of infectious disease in Hospitals in the vicinity of the River. These arrangements have worked satisfactorily during the year. Disinfection of cases, their clothing, bedding and effects continue to be carried out at Denton Hospital. No case of human plague occurred during the year on any vessel bound for London. Of the 3,259 rats examined bacteriologically, 925 were from ships and 2,334 were from shore premises. No rats were reported to be infected with Plague. Seventy-six vessels were fumigated for rodent destruction and the issue af an International Certificate, under the supervision of your Inspectors, 17 by sulphur dioxide resulting in the destruction of 640 rats and 11 mice and 59 by hydrogen cyanide accounting for 2,633 rats and 77 mice. In addition 4,661 rats were trapped in ships and 4,114 on shore premises in the Port. The work of rodent repression in the Port area has been considerably intensified during the year and is the subject of a separate report. The Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, continued in operation and the work thereunder is reported on page 6. The arrangements whereby the registration of Water Barges was made conditional upon the report of your Officers as to their fitness for the carriage of drinking water, continued to work smoothly. During the year 1,457 tons of foodstuffs were condemned as unfit for human consumption and were either reconditioned or disposed of for animal or for industrial purposes under suitable guarantee, or destroyed. -5- Particular attention has been paid to the salvage of damaged foodstuffs and their reconditioning where possible, to render then fit, either for human consumption or for animal consumption or for industrial purposes. Your Medical Officer is pleased to report that many, hundreds of tons of foodstuffs have been saved and he wishes to take this opportunity of thanking the Officers of the Ministry of Food, of the Port of London Authority and of private firms for the valuable collaboration that made this possible. He also wishes to thank the Officers of His Majesty's Customs, Port of London Authority, the Pilots and the Members of the Staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants for their collaboration and help in every aspect of the work of the Port of London Health Authority throughout the year, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, M.

The inspection of foodstuffs, lying in the area of the Port Health Authority, under the Public Health (imported Food) Regulations,1937 and the Public Health (Preservatives &c.,in Food) Regulations, 1925-1927, continued to work smoothly despite the added burden and res onsibility of inspecting and advising as to the disposal of foodstuffs damaged directly or indirectly by enemy action. Owing to the need for the conservation of food supplies the high standards required in peace time have, in some ways, had to be relaxed. Indeed there is now a totally new policy on food inspection and control, resulting in the saving of large quantities of foodstuffs which, by careful sorting and by reconditioning, have been rendered, without appreciable deterioration of quality, perfectly fit for human consumption. Large quantities of foodstuffs which in peace time would have been for the most part destroyed have been diverted to useful purposes such as for animal and poultry feeding. The nett amount of foodstuffs that has been lost is, thanks to these measures, a remarkably small proportion (less than 5%) of the whole. There is little doubt that many elements in this new policy in the conservation of food sup-plies will continue after the war, not primarily of necessity, but to replace the old and, it must be frankly stated, wasteful habits and practices of pre-war days. PARROTS (PROHIBITION OF IMPORT) REGULATIONS, 1950. Fourteen parrots etc,came under the notice of your Officers during the year. Nine Notices were issued in respect of 14 parrots etc. Number exported in respect of Notices served 12. Number destroyed (Notice served to export) 1.
