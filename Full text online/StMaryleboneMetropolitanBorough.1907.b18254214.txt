These births and deaths are divided among the four sub-districts as set forth in Tables V. and VI. Ninety-nine of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 70 Childrens Hospital Paddington 3 St. Mary's Hospital 5 University College Hospital 3 St. George's Hospital 1 St. Thomas' Hospital 1 French Hospital 1 St. Peters' Home, Kensington 1 St. Luke's Home, Kensington 1 Royal Hospital for Incurables 1 Darenth Asylum 2 Colney Hatch Asylum 1 Tooting Bee Asylum 1 Banstead Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 1 Claybury Asylum 1 Hanwell Asylum 3 Other Addresses 2 Total 99 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 28.0; death-rate 20.4. St. Mary, birth-rate 15.9; death-rate 18.7. Christ Church, birth-rate 29.0; death-rate 26.2. St. John, birth-rate 24.7; death-rate 21.6. The whole district, birth-rate 22.8; death-rate 20.7. The average death-rates for ten years (1897 to 1906) for the corresponding period were as follows:—All Souls, 14.8; St. Mary, 21.4; Christ Church, 17.2; St. John, 28.3; the whole district, 19.5. 3 The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes.

Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 4 Health of the District Climatic conditions and the re-appearance of Influenza has exercised an unfavourable influence on health. The death-rate is decidedly above the average of the ten preceding years, and the increase is really more than the average seems to indicate for the ten Januarys, including the fatal January of 1900, when Influenza appeared in an epidemic form, and the deaths were more than double the usual number. Chief Sanitary Inspector. The Public Health Committee almost unanimously consider that a Chief Sanitary Inspector should hold a medical qualification; this view has been at length adopted by a majority of the Council. The writer believes that if a proper selection can be made, such an officer, by whatever name he may be called, whether Assistant Medical Officer of Health or other title will be far more useful than a person with simply the qualifications of a Surveyor or Clerk of the Works. Prosecutions. Charles Joyce, of Enfield, was summoned under the Bye-laws (Metropolitan Management Act, 1855, sec. 202,) for doing work, without depositing plans or giving notice, at 117, Park Road. The Magistrate imposed a penalty of £5 and 2/- costs.

During the four weeks ending March 2nd, there have been registered 177 births, and 190 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the four sub-districts as set forth in Tables 1Y. and V. Seventy-two of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 47 Western Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 6 Children's Hospital Paddington 2 University College Hospital 1 King's College Hospital 1 Victoria Hospital, Chelsea 1 Colney Hatch Asylum 2 Dartford Heath Asylum 1 Peckham House Asylum 1 Darenth Asylum 1 Tooting Bee Asylum 1 Cane Hill Asylum 1 St. Luke's House 1 St. Anne's Home, Stoke Newington 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 Paddington Workhouse 1 Other Addresses 2 Total 72 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the four weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 11.9; death-rate 12.0.

Includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Influenza, Whooping Cough, Erysipelas, Croup, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 3. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 16 Spotted Fever. Cerebro spinal meningitis (spotted fever) threatens to become epidemic in the Metropolis. Up to the present there have been one or two possible cases in the Borough, but not one of these has been diagnosed with certainty. It appears that in a large number of cases the symptoms are so similar to influenza and one or two other diseases that mistakes may easily be made; the only certain method of identification is a method of bacteriological examination. Since the malady is associoated with a minute parasite it may with confidence be stated that it is "communicable," but how it is communicated from one person to another is obscure. It will now be the duty of the sanitary officers to enforce the same measures of isolation and disinfection as in the ordinary notifiable and infectious maladies. No arrangement has been made with the Asylums Board with regard to cases of cerebro spinal meningitis but the general Hospitals have hitherto raised no difficulty in receiving suspected cases. Disinfecting Apparatus. About 11 years ago the then Vestry purchased and erected a large Goddard and Massey's steam disinfector, this has been in use every working day. The outer boiler is now entirely worn out and will have to be renewed or the whole apparatus may have to be replaced; over ten thousand separate articles are submitted to steam disinfection each year, so that it is absolutely necessary to be provided with apparatus of sufficient size and of high efficiency. For the moment the Borough of Hampstead is assisting by allowing the larger articles, which cannot be disinfected in our smaller supplementary disinfector, to be disinfected in their apparatus. Some years ago the Vestry of St. Marylebone, under similar circumstances, came to the aid of Hampstead in the matter of disinfection. Home Work Regulation Bill. The following report was submitted to the Public Health Committee, March 1.5th, and unanimously adopted:— 17 The Homework Regulation Bill, should it become law in its present state, will profoundly affect the general sanitary administration of the Factory Acts in this Borough. No one of the numerous drapers, dressmakers, tailors, etc., in the district will be allowed to give any work to be finished or made outside their establishments save to a Certificated Outworker. Those who wish to do work at home must have a certificate to the effect that the room they work in, is suitable from a sanitary standpoint for such work, and particularly that it is adequately ventilated, and such certificate would have to be renewed every six months. Before taking any work they will have to apply for this certificate, whereupon a Home Office Inspector, in course of time, will inspect the room and grant, or not grant the certificate, as the case may be. The whole of the Act is to be carried out by Home Office Inspectors, and when one considers the immense number of persons in the dressmaking and tailoring trades that work at home, it is obvious that the Government will have to appoint quite an army of Inspectors to cope with the work. I consider that it is highly objectionable to ignore in this way the Sanitary Officers of the Local Authority. If the Bill is necessary, the provisions could be more economically carried out by the Officers of each Local Authority. There is a perfect mania among some legislators for inspection and multiplying inspectors; at the present time besides a number of voluntary or outside inspectors connected with various societies, there are three different sets of statutory inspectors, viz., the Local Officers, the County Council Officers, and the Ilome Office Inspectors roaming about the district; the practical application of the Bill woidd enormously increase the latter class. I trust, that in the interests of both employer and employed, the Committee will send a representation to the Parliamentary Committee suggesting that the Bill be opposed. 18 TABLE II.—Giving the Causes of Deaths during February, 1907, at the Middlesex Hospital, Queen Charlotte's Lymg-in-Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, the Workhouse, the Hospital of St. John and Elizabeth, and the Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, W.

Vol. XXVIII. 3, Upper Gloucester Place, W., Apbil 10th, 1907. No. 3. The week ending March 9th was one of variable light winds. Minimum temperature, 30.5°; maximum, 49.0°; mean, 41.3°. On three days rain fell to the total amount of 0.32 inch. Sunshine 23.9 hours, equal to 32.7%. Mean barometer 30.3 inches. The week ending March 16th was one of unsettled mild weather. Minimum temperature, 26.0°; maximum, 52.8°; mean, 44.1°. On five days rain fell to the total of 0.5 inch. The winds were mostly south-westerly. Sunshine was equal to 31.8%. Mean barometer, 29.9 inches. The week ending March 23rd was generally fine and bright. Minimum temperature, 33.5°; maximum, 59.0°; mean, 48.6°. On three days rain fell the total amount being equal to 0.12 inch. Winds westerly. Sunshine equal to 60.6%. Mean barometer, 30.0 inches. The week ending March 30th was quite exceptional in temperature. With a minimum of 41.5° the maximum attained was the summer temperature of 66.0°; the mean being 49.6°. No rain fell. Winds S.E and S.S.E., very light. In many parts of the country the sunshine coincided almost with the hours that the sun was above the horizon, but morning mists interfered with the London records and the sunshine registered in Regent's Park, amounted to 28.96 hours out of a possible 87.5, in other words, the sunshine was only equal to 33%. Mean barometer, 30.0 inches. 26 Births and Deaths. During the four weeks ending March 30th, there have been registered 208 births and 194 deaths—equal to a birth-rate of 21.0 and a death-rate of 19.6 per thousand. The mean death-rate for the corresponding period during the previous ten years was 21.8 per thousand. QUARTERLY SUMMARY. During the March quarter there have been registered 667 births and 640 deaths. These births and deaths are divided among the four subdistricts as set forth in Table V.

Shoolbred, was summoned for executing sanitary work without notice and without the deposition of plans, at 117, Park Road, and fined 5s. and costs. A tenant, named Fox man, at 122, Marylebone Road, refused admission to the owners' workmen, who in compliance with a requisition by the Local Authority desired to construct a new drain throughout the premises. The Magistrate granted an order for the admission of the workmen. The order was obeyed. The Solicitors applied for a warrant against the same tenant's, wife, and another female lodger because they would not allow the house refuse, which had accumulated, to be removed through the front passage. The Magistrate declined to grant a warrant on the ground that the dustmen had been admitted, and the Act only provided for refusal to admit. Health of the District during the March Quarter. The first quarter of the year is usually one of considerable sickness and mortality, for the true winter of late years appears to be concentrated in January and February rather than in November and December. The March quarter of 1907 was a little under the average in death-rate. No special epidemic has to be recorded, spotted fever threatened, but no genuine case was notified. The advent of chicken-pox suggested the possible incidence of its allied and more serious congener—small-pox, but although a local paper reported that a death had occurred in Lisson Grove of this malady, the report was erroneous, the case being that of a child dying from measles and pneumonia. The ten years average death-rate from the more communicable diseases for the three months in question is a little over 2 per thousand of the population, the record for this quarter is well under two. Scarlet fever rose and fell in a somewhat curious fashion, as shown by the curve opposite page 32. During the first three weeks of January, the first week of February, and the last three weeks of March, it was distinctly above the average, but the remaining four weeks below the average. Diphtheria 29 generally, save in the eleventh week of the year, was below the average. The general result of all the above observations is, that the first quarter of 1907 has been an average one of sickness and death. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts (Table II.) The large number of 254 samples has been examined and analysed during the quarter. Of these, 23 samples of milk, 2 samples of butter, 1 sample of coffee, and a sample of tinned rabbit were returned as adulterated. Most of the vendors were prosecuted and convicted. The tin of curried rabbit was evidently from an old stock; the inside of the tin was much discoloured, the contents dirty. Boric acid was present in the proportion of 17.4 grains per lb. Much iron, but no tin, could be detected. The vendor destroyed the remainder of the stock, which was very small. Out of the 35 butters, 6 samples contained .37 per cent, of boric acid. The samples of sardines, salmon and pineapple were all good and contained no preservatives. Two of the samples of sugar were coloured by a minute quantity of aniline dye. It is wholly unnecessary to dye sugar. A prosecution under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts was some years ago undertaken by the Vestry for selling similar sugar. The prosecution failed, showing the necessity of prohibiting the colouring of sugar by statute. Thomas Williams, of 94, Devonshire Street, was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 134 per cent., and fined 10s. and 12s. 6d. costs. Philip Lane, of 25, William Street, Lisson Grove, was fined £2 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 33 per cent., and containing added water to the extent of 23.9 per cent. George Lord, of 61, Lisson Street, was fined £2 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk deficient in milk fat 24.7 per cent. James Hall, of 69, Marylebone Lane, was fined £5 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 6.7 per cent, and containing added water to the extent of 29.9 per cent. The same defendant was fined £5 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling a coffee mixture as coffee which contained 35 per cent, of chicory. 30 W. E. Banks, of 17a, Upper Marylebone Street was fined 10s. and 12s. 6d. costs for selling margarine as butter. Charles Staples, of 55, Great Titchfield Street, was fined £2 and 12s. 6d. costs for a similar offence. William Stacey, of 3, Harcourt Street, was fined 2s. 6d. and 12s. 6d. costs for selling skim milk diluted with 16 per cent, of water. The case against a vendor who was summoned for selling milk diluted with 15.7 per cent, of water and deficient in milk fat to the extent of 18 per cent, was dismissed, owing to a technical error in the wording of the summons. John Thomas, of 30, Earl Street, was fined £1 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk deficient in milk fat 16.7 per cent., and diluted with 12 per cent, water. The Park Tea Co., of 21, Yoik Place, was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 6.67 per cent, and diluted with 10.7 per cent, of water, and fined 10s. and 12s. 6d. costs. 31 TABLE II.—SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

Seventy of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary 42 St. Mary's Hospital 5 Western Fever Hospital 1 North Western Hospital 2 South Wharf (Metropolitan Asylums Board) 1 Children's Hospital, Paddington Green 1 University College Hospital 3 Royal Free Hospital 1 Great Northern Hospital 1 German Hospital 1 Hanwell Asylum 2 Banstead Asylum 2 Claybury Asylum 1 Caterham Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 1 Bethnal House Asylum 1 Holborn Workhouse 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 St. Joseph's House, Kensington 1 Other Addresses 1 Total 70 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 12.7; death-rate 13.5.

Health of the District during the Month of April. The health of the district has been above the average; there have been fewer cases of infectious maladies, fewer chest complaints, and a smaller number of deaths than the average of ten previous corresponding months. A single case of small-pox occurred during the month; a person who had been in close contact with a case of small-pox in another district also came to live in Marylebone. There has been no extension of the malady. Spotted Fever. Throughout the County of London during the month of March 42 cases of supposed cerebro spinal meningitis Avere notified, and 16 in April; hence the disease is obviously less prevalent. Of the total 58 cases, 24 were undoubtedly 43 true cases, for the diagnosis was confirmed by bacteriological observation; 3 cases were certainly not true cases, and the remaining 24 were probably true cases, but the diagnosis was not confirmed by bacteriological observations. Two children in different parts of St. Marylebone, the one aged 9, the other 6, have suffered from the malady ; in neither case has there been any spread. Florists and the Factory Acts. The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901, sect. 149, applies the Act to any premises in which any manual labour is exercised by way of trade, or for purposes of gain in or incidental to any of the following purposes, namely: (1) The making of any article or part of any article. (2) The altering, repairing, ornamenting or finishing of any article, or (3) The adapting for sale of any article. These provisions have lately not been applied to Florists' establishments, for one of the stipendiary magistrates decided that as flowers were a natural and not a manufactured article, they did not come under the Act; this decision has now been appealed against,* and it has been definitely laid down by the High Court that the preparing of a natural article for sale is included in the definitions of the Factory Acts. This decision will affect at least eight Florists' establishments in the Borough. Query. At Oxford Circus and similar standing places where Flower-sellers congregate they are to be seen daily arranging and re-arranging their flowers, or making up flowers for the buttonhole. Do such localities become "Work-places?" *Hoare v.

The usual summer diarrhoea, which often begins at this time of the year, and tends to raise the death-rate, lias been practically absent. Pulmonary complaints and infectious diseases have also been but little prevalent; the consequence of these combined causes is that the public health has been exceptionally good and compares favourably with the similar period in past years. 54 Disinfection. The disinfecting apparatus is again in working order although not quite perfect. Since the 22nd of May the kind services of the Borough of Hampstead have been dispensed with, and it is anticipated, when a few small defects have been seen to, that no such considerable repair will be required for some years. The writer has, however, reported to the Public Health Committee the desirability of duplicating the disinfecting apparatus at the Stone Yard. With all such apparatus, "break downs" will occur, and usually at a period of greatest stress. Seeing that such duplication will be an expensive matter, for which no provision has been made in this year's estimates, the matter very properly stands over for the moment, but it is one which will have to be seriously faced at some future date. Prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act. Four summonses were taken out against G. Botwright, of 30, High Street, Manchester Square, for failure to deposit plans and for doing work in contravention of the London County Council By-laws at 32, York Terrace. The defendant was convicted and fined in all £2. The summons against the occupiers of 122, Marylebone Road, for allowing the dust to accumulate on the premises, was withdrawn, the chief defendant having permitted the removal of the refuse. 55 TABLE II.—Giving the Causes of Deaths during May, 1907, at the Middlesex Hospital, Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, the Workhouse, the Hospital of St. John and Elizabeth, and the Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill, W.

These births and deaths are divided among the four sub-districts as set forth in Table V. One hundred and ninety-four of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows:— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Hill 105 St. Mary's Hospital 16 Western Fever Hospital 3 North "Western Hospital 5 South Wharf (Metropolitan Asylums Board) 1 Children's Hospital, Paddington Green 5 Children's Hospital, Great Ormonde Street 2 University College Hospital 6 St. George's Hospital 3 London Hospital 1 Royal Free Hospital 1 Great Northern Hospital 1 German Hospital 2 French Hospital 1 London Fever Hospital 1 Cancer Hospital, Chelsea 3 Homoepathie Hospital 1 Hanwell Asylum 6 Banstead Asylum 4 Claybury Asylum 4 Colney Hatch Asylum 4 Caterham Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 2 Hoxton Asylum 1 Tooting Bee Asylum 1 Camberwell House Asylum 1 Bethnal House Asylum 1 Carried forward 182 63 Brought forward 182 St. Luke's House 1 St. Peter's House 1 Clapham Maternity 1 St. Joseph's House, Kensington 3 Holborn WorkTiouse 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 Other Addresses 4 Total 194 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the four months' statistics are as follows:— All Souls, birth-rate 15.8; death-rate 12.6.

The three months of exceptionally cool damp summer weather has been far more favourable to health than a more normal dry hot season. The death and sickness rates have both been unusually low. Scarlet fever threatened to rise in the second week of June, but rapidly subsided and the curve opposite page 66 shows a general course below the average of the previous ten years. Returns of Births. The Council, on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, have resolved to obtain from the Registrars, not only the bare numbers of births, but also the details of residence and occupation. The new departure will enable the officers of the Local Authority to reduce still further infant mortality. In relation to this subject, the "Infant Consultations," inaugurated by the St. Marylebone Health Society in conjunction with the public dispensaries in St. John's Wood and Welbeck Street, are now in full operation. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. (See Table II.) 241 samples, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, were submitted for analysis. The full list is tabulated (Table II.) page 66. Of 60 samples of milk 11 were adulterated, either being deficient in milk fat or diluted with water or both. There were no preservatives found or colouring matter. In 27 cases there was more dirt in the milk than ought to occur with clean methods of dairying. From a public health point of view, dirty milk is more serious than skimmed or diluted milk. In 3 samples of butter small quantities of boric acid were found. In one case margarine was sold as butter. Owing to an investigation by the Local Government Board on the presence of lead and arsenic in commercial tartaric acid, seven samples of the acid were obtained locally, lead was found to be present from .0018 to .0035 per cent, quantities too small to affect health. The samples did not contain any arsenic or copper. 65 Samples of so-called non-alcoholic wines were examined, viz., two of ginger, three of raisin, and one of black currant; all of these contained salicylic acid from 4.4 to 5.26 grains per pint and quantities of alcohol up to 5.0 per cent, proof spirit. Samples of ice-cream were made of clean materials and the various tinned and bottled goods were all free from preservatives. The following prosecutions were instituted :— William Smith, of 96, Balcombe Street, was summoned for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 24.7 per cent., and diluted with water 23.6 per cent. The defendant was fined £1 and 12/6 costs. A. B. Yeo, trading under the name of The New Pasteurised Milk Co., 9, Moreton Street, Pimlico, was fined £10 and costs for selling, in Upper Charlton Street, milk deprived of its milk fat to the extent of 36.7 per cent. The defendant did not pay the fine at once, and a warrant for his apprehension was issued ; the fine was then paid. On a subsequent occasion William Carlver of 19, Wealdon Street, Stockwell, and Yeo were summoned, both apparently being connected with the same business, but this was denied. The summons, instead of being worded A, B. Yeo, was accidentally worded W. Yeo, and the case against Yeo was dismissed; William Carlver was fined £10 and 12/6 costs for selling milk deprived of its milk fat to the extent of 86 per cent. William Thomas Jones, of 71, Church Street, was summoned for selling milk diluted with 20 per cent, water and fined 10s. and 12s. 6d. costs. Ebenezer John Gooding, of 75, York-street, Montagu Square, was fined £2 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk diluted with 8 per cent, water and deficient in milk fat to the extent of 10.7 per cent. Alfred Kelsey, of 47, Queen Street, was fined £1 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk diluted with 11.7 per cent, water and deficient in milk fat to the extent of 16 per cent. E. Wrixton, of 31, Riding House Street, was fined £1 with costs 12s. 6d. for selling margarine for butter. 66 TABLE II.—SALE OF FOOD AND DEUGS ACTS. Samples Analysed during June Quarter. 1907.

On five days rain fell (0.52 inch). Winds W. and S.W. Mean barometer 29.8 inches. The five weeks were therefore on the whole cool, deficient in sunshine and wet, 19 out of the 35 days yielding rain to the total quantity of 2.16 inch. 76 Births and Deaths During the five weeks ending August 3rd, there have been registered 270 births and 137 deaths. These births and deaths are divided amongst the four sub-districts, as set forth in Table IV. Fifty-eight of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows :— The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the four weeks' statistics are as follows :— All Souls, birth-rate 19.1 ; death-rate 8.3. St. Mary, birth-rate 14.8; death-rate 9.8. Christ Church, birth-rate 31.5 : death-rate 13.4. St. John, birth-rate 21.6; death-rate 13.9. The whole district, birth-rate 21.8; death-rate 11.1. The average death-rates for ten years (1897 to 1906) for the corresponding period were as follows:—All Souls, 11.4; St. Mary, 14.1; Christ Church, 14.1; St. John, 19.7; the whole district, 14.3. The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease, and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. TABLE I.

Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. 78 Health of the District. The cool breezy summer month of July, 1907. will be long remembered as one of exceptional health. The deaths from diarrhoea during the month have averaged during the previous ten years 20, but this July they are only 2, a tenth of the average number. The mortality from the infectious diseases generally is about a third of the usual amount, and the same statement may be made with regard to chest complaints. On the other hand a reference to the curve opposite page 79, will show that scarlet fever during the second week of July rose considerably above the usual level, Diphtheria also showed a slight tendency to increase. By-laws as to Houses let in Lodgings. These by-laws have at length been confirmed by the Local Government Board, they are practically the same as a previous set of by-laws in force some years ago. The by-laws give power to the Local Authority to register tenement houses, both owner and occupier of such registered houses have a number of duties with regard to over-crowding, cleansing, sanitation, and other matters. The advantage of having by-laws is mainly administrative ; it is not easy to prove that a dirty passage or ceiling is per se injurious to health, but if such a condition is an infringement of a by-law it is then only necessary to establish the fact without any theory as to the bearing of such fact on health. The method of applying the by-laws followed on a previous occasion consisted in bringing up at each meeting of the Public Health Committee a list of houses which it was proposed to put on the register. Such lists the Committee adopted or not by resolution. This course will probably be followed. JUL 7.

A striking result of the cool summer is the low incidence of sickness and death from diarrhoea and intestinal maladies. The average deaths during the quarter for the past ten years from diarrhœal maladies is 76, the number varying from a minimum of 26 in 1903 to a maximum of 146 in 1899. This year, however, the deaths from this cause only amount to 11. Pulmonary complaints have also been below the average, as well as deaths from consumption. Notification of Birtbs Act, 1907. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, received the final sanction on August 28th. It is a decided step indirectly in the right direction, and in those localities in which the Act is adopted will assist greatly in the prevention of infant mortality. Leaving on one side the complicated and rather lengthy steps to be taken to put the Act in force, the essential provisions are simply as follows: Notification of a birth must be given within 36 hours to the Officers of the local Sanitary Authority. This duty is cast upon the father, should he be actually residing in the house, and any person " in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth." In this district arrangements have been made with the Registrars of Births and Deaths to give weekly lists of births registered. Should the Council elect to adopt the Act these lists will be unnecessary, and the place and date of every birth will be known at the Sanitary Office within two days of its occurrence. 89 The Laboratory—Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 246 samples have been analysed during the past quarter. A full list is given on page 99, Table XII. Of these, four samples of milk were returned as adulterated and two samples of whisky. One of the samples of milk was just below standard, and no prosecution followed. Edwin Puzey, of 53, Charlbert Street, was fined £1 and 12s. 6d. costs for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 20 per cent. The vendor of a sample of milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 18 per cent. put in a warranty, and the case was dismissed. A fourth sample of adulterated milk is still sub judice. None of the milks contained any preservatives. 23 were slightly coloured with annatto. Two samples of cream contained small quantities of boron preservative, equal respectively to half a grain and nine-tenths of a grain per lb. of boric acid. A sample of raisin wine contained 4½ grains, and a sample of ginger wine 6 grains per pint, of boric acid. A Frankfort sausage (undivided) contained the large quantity of 21 grains of boric acid per lb. The Inspector attempted to get an official (divided) sample, but failed. Two tins of peas and one tin of spinach contained 2 to 3 grains of copper sulphate to the lb. These tins were protected by a label stating that a small quantity of copper had been added to preserve the colour. The two samples of whisky Avere only slightly diluted below the standard. In each case the vendor called attention to a notice in the bar informing his customers that his spirits were diluted. 90 TABLE II.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge, of the Medical Officer of Health, in the Sanitary District of ST, MARYLEBONE, during August 1907, classified according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.

These births and deaths are divided amongst the four sub-districts, as set forth in Table II. Fifty-five of the deaths were extra-parochial as follows :— St. Marylebone Infirmary, Notting Rill 38 St. Mary's Hospital 6 Western Hospital 3 North West Hospital 1 Northern Hospital 1 Children's Hospital, Paddington 1 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 1 University Hospital 1 Holborn Workhouse 1 Other Addresses 2 Total 55 The birth and death-rates, as deduced from the five weeks' statistics are as follows :— All Souls, birth-rate 16.3 ; death-rate 8.3.

The following table gives, as usual, facilities for comparing the relative mortality from certain classes of disease, and proportion to 1,000 deaths from all causes. 109 TABLE I.

Scarlet fever during the month throughout the metropolis has been unduly prevalent, the curve for St. Marylebone however, only shows a moderate increase, and a reference to Table 1, page 109 shows that the mortality from all infectious fevers is slightly lower than for the corresponding period during the last ten years. Appeal to the London County Council. The Architect of an important Public building designed and had constructed two manhole chambers with channels made of Portland Cement instead of the usual glazed channels. The writer declined to pass the same considering that the said channels were not in accordance with the Bye-laws. The Architect argued that they were equally efficient and, on the Public Health Committee confirming the action of their officer, appealed to the London County Council. The appeal was dismissed. The case therefore must be taken as a precedent, and it will not be prudent for builders or architects in this district to attempt to make such channels in cement. OCTOBER 1907.

Diphtheria and typhoid cases have been less than usual. The death-rate for the whole district is an average death-rate. The mortality from chest complaints, despite of the foggy November, is lower than usual. 120 TABLE II.—TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES Ot INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical O/jictr of Health, in the Sanitary District oj ST M.ARY"LEBONE, during November, 1907, according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.
