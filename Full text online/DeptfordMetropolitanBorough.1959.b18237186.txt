DEPT 44 AC 4375 Metropolitan Borough of Deptford ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1959 BY J. KERR BROWN B.Sc., M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE The Worshipful the Mayor (Alderman Lt.-Col. C. G. Blanchard, J.P.) (Deceased) and (Councillor A. J. Blackman, J.P.) Chairman: Councillor R. S. Marriott, J.P. Councillor T. F. Agambar „ S. H. Banks „ A. A. J. Bullen F. W. Bullion „ A. A. Carroll Alderman Mrs. M. J. Chrisp Councillor A. E. Cox „ J. D. Day „ Mrs. A. M. Ott „ F. A. Smith Public Health Department, Deptford Town Hall, S.E.14. Telephones:— TIDeway 1288. TIDeway 1360. July, 1960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to present the report on the health and environmental circumstances of Deptford for 1959. The birth rate has increased from 16-47 to 17-57 and there has been a slight decrease in deaths. Once again it is noticeable that deaths from neoplasm of the lung and bronchus have again increased and accounted for 55 of the total deaths in the Borough. Illegitimate births increased by 22 and constituted 8-25% of the total births. There were 805 cases of measles and 144 whooping cough notified, and these accounted very largely for the total increase of notifications of infectious diseases during the year. There was one case of Poliomyelitis and the Borough was free of Diphtheria. I am pleased to include in my report a contribution from Dr. Rigby the Chest Physician, on the work of the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, and also a report of the year's work from Dr. Morgan of the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit. The final phase of the battle against Pulmonary Tuberculosis has begun but the organism is tenacious and versatile and the residuum of infection in the population may persist for many years to come. Fortunately with chemo-therapy, B.C.G. and Mass Radiography used intelligently and resolutely, the final issue should be beyond reasonable doubt. Services for the old people were expanded by the appointment of a Woman Health Officer to visit the aged and infirm in their own homes and generally to supervise cleanliness and their personal needs. The Laundry service for the incontinent was enlarged and the number of articles laundered was more than doubled last year. It is hoped that bathing and laundry facilities will continue to expand even further in the future. Once again the County Council Institutions and the Geriatric Unit at St. Alfege's Hospital must be thanked for the help and co-operation which the Department receives. Turning to environmental matters, it must be observed that overcrowding may become a serious problem in certain parts of the Borough. There is evidence that large houses are being broken up into small flats and allowed to be occupied by numbers far in excess of statutory limits. The legal limit does not set a high standard and it will be a grave matter if this already low standard is allowed to be flagrantly contravened. With the shortage of Public Health Inspectors it is impossible to institute house to house inspection in order fully to assess the position and, in any case, to be effective, inspection would have to be undertaken in the evening or even during the night. Nevertheless despite the practical difficulties of inspection and ascertaining precise numbers in occupation, this Department will continue to report to the Committee for any action cases of statutory overcrowding which become apparent. In conclusion 1 must express gratitude to the Chairman and Vice- Chairman for their support at all times, and to the staff for work done during the year under review. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. 2 STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, B.Sc., M.B., ch.B., D.P.H. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar-General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.97 and for deaths 1.01 and the birth rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 560, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 393. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table. I The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres. Estimated mid-year home population 69,660 Live Births- Legitimate 1123 Illegitimate 101 1,224 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 living population 17.57 Still Births— Legitimate 24 Illegitimate 6 30 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 (live and still births.) 23.9 Total Live and Still Births 1,254 Infant Deaths— Legitimate 22 Illegitimate 1 23 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — total 18.79 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — legitimate 19.59 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — illegitimate 9.90 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (first four weeks) 13.07 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 8.25% Maternal Deaths (including abortion) 1 Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 0.79 Total Deaths 831 Death Rate (per 1,000 living) 11.92 6 Section " B " INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed an increase of 738. This increase was more than accounted for in the increase of Measles notifications by 683 and Whooping Cough by 87. There were no deaths due to either Measles or Whooping Cough. Sonné Dysentery continued to be troublesome from time to time, but close co-operation by the Public Health Department Staff with local medical practitioners and school authorities, in addition to personal hygiene education by the Public Health Inspector concerned, kept the outbreaks to a minimum. A total of 1,388 visits in this connection was paid by the Public Health Inspector. There was no significant alteration in the numbers of the Infectious Diseases as compared with the previous year.

Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Public Health Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. There was a decrease of 8 in the number of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified for the first time (2 male and 6 female) and the number of deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1959 was again low, i.e., 10 males and 3 females. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 6 of the male deaths and 1 female death were of persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 30% were within this age group. 8 Tuberculosis Register Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary F Total M F Total M 62 92 4 7 30 Cases notified for the first time 3 4 4 - - Posthumous notifications - - 21 54 New cases in Borough coming to knowledge otherwise than by primary notification - 1 1 33 I am indebted to the Chest Physician, Dr. J. P. V. Rigby, for the following report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, which is of great interest: — Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.59:— Definite 1,117 Observation 43 Number of new contacts examined 366 Total attendance at the Chest Clinic 6,572 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary 488 Cases assisted by Care Committee 47 Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale, 1959 £84 1s. 5d. (The latter figure was greatly assisted by the raising of £190 by the Friends of the Deptford Chest Clinic during 1959.) " The following is a brief resume of the year's activities: The number of 1,117 tuberculous cases on the register remains remarkably constant, even though 129 cases were removed from the register during the year as having left the borough. A large number of cases come into the area and take the place of those who have left. 98 cases of tuberculosis of all types were diagnosed during 1959. The large numbers of cases of tuberculosis who move in and out of Deptford must consistute a local feature. The numbers of changes of address in cases that I have got to know well, have always struck me as being remarkably high. During a time of considerable re-organisation of housing in the area, perhaps some movement of this type is to be expected. One disturbing feature which occupies a great deal of the Chest Physician's time, is the question of re-housing of tuberculous cases through official channels, which, in my opinion, remains deplorably slow. Though the number of deaths from tuberculosis shows a gradual decline, the amount of disability still present among those cases who survive, is still very great and much time and energy is spent at the Chest Clinic assisting these cases and deciding on their individual treatment. 95 cases were sent away from Deptford for treatment in hospitals or sanatoria during the year. A great many more cases are treated at home and some are allowed to return to work whilst on active treatment if they are not a danger to themselves or others in so doing. Chronic bronchitis and other similar chest diseases are also responsible for much of the Chest Physician's work in this area, which, like many parts of the Thames valley, is low-lying and subject to fog, often contaminated by gross atmospheric impurities. Many cases attending the Chest Clinic were subject to intensive investigations to exclude cancer of the lung. 19 new cases of this disease were discovered during 1959 of whom no less than 18 were males. More than half occurred during the working period of life. One of the great tragedies is the relative lateness at which cases of cancer of the lung present themselves—11 of the 19 cases when first seen here were considered to be beyond the possibility of operation to remove the growth. Of the 19 cases 18 had smoked possibly over 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years or more, many greatly in excess of this figure. A glance at the residences of the patients found to suffer from cancer, reveals that well over 60% were living along main highways or bus routes. It has long been held in some quarters that the exhaust fumes, particularly from diesel engines, are a dangerous factor in the causation of lung cancer. It has certainly been proved that Benzypyrene is a well-known agent in cancer formation and occurs in the exhaust fumes of motor vehicles. I understand that considerable research has recently been carried out, particularly in California, where a law is being passed that every motor vehicle should be fitted with an ' after burner' which would burn the dangerous Benzpyrene from the exhaust gases. It would indeed be a great step forward if some similar measure could be taken in congested urban areas. It is, of course, difficult to draw conclusions from the above-mentioned small number of cases of cancer, but I still hold from previous experience of this disease that heavy tobacco smoking is a main factor in its causation." Mass Miniature Radiography I append below a report I have received from the Director of the Mass Radiography Unit: " I enclose analyses of results of surveys carried out during the year 1959. In the overall analysis of those mass X-rayed in Deptford, you will note that fifteen close supervision or treatment type cases of tuberculosis were found in a total of 9,474, an apparent incidence of 1.6. These can be sub-divided into nine cases found amongst those not previously mass X-rayed within the last five years and six amongst those previously mass X-rayed. The actual discovery rates, therefore, are nine cases out of 2,444 not previously examined and six cases among the 7,030 previously examined, giving incidences of 3-7 and 0-9 respectively. 10 Clearly, therefore, we need to find some means for examining larger numbers of the more resistant groups in the population. Yours sincerely, (Signed) J. Mansel Morgan, Director."

The total number of primary inspections increased from 6,185 in 1958 to 6,941. The number of complaints increased from 1,385 to 1,392, a total of 7. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council (General Powers) Acts and the London County Council Bye-Laws. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two operators were employed throughout most of the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out: — 14 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1959 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.

A high proportion of business premises in the Borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. 16 Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 44 Premises disinfected (requests) 61 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 144 Total number of rooms disinfected 419 Total number of articles disinfected 15,018 Books disinfected 63 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 306 There was a small amount of disinfection undertaken on behalf of the Admiralty in respect of stores of bedding at the Royal Victoria Yard, Grove Street, Deptford, and £20 18s. 5d. was received from the Admiralty. In addition, a local firm required bags to be steam disinfected before export and an amount of £12 10s. 0d. was received in respect of this service. Bathing Station Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 803 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo 64 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 244 Scabies baths for adults 42 Laundry The laundry service is for aged infirm people in the Borough, who are incontinent and who have difficulty in obtaining someone to wash and cleanse their bedclothes and personal underclothing, etc. The equipment consists of a Washing Machine, Hydro-extractor and Ironing Machine, and the work is carried out by the Bathing Station and Disinfecting staff. Number of patients 64 Number of collections and deliveries 2,698 Number of articles cleansed 16,558 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. 17 The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and sufficient water supply were issued in respect of 191 new premises. Clean Air Act, 1956 A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department building, and results and details are sent to the Fuel Research Station. Attached is a summary of readings during the year.

Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to County Hall. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables, V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. 178 Evelyn Street Details will be found in Appendix VI.

The requisitioned properties housed 388 units of tenancy. During the year, 103 flats and maisonettes were completed for the Council. Also, 2,411 improvements were carried out in 764 houses, rather less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 176. Apart from the flats, etc., completed by the Council 56 flats and maisonettes were completed by the London County Council, and 32 houses were completed by private builders. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1959:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 1,535 Number of Statutory Notices served 321 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 764 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. RENT ACT, 1957. During the year applications under the Act were received and dealt with as follows:— Applications by tenants for Certificates of Disrepair:— 48 (Granted 15. Undertakings given by landlords 28. Refused or withdrawn 5) Applications by landlords for Revocation of Certificates of Disrepair:— (Granted 22.

Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are normally sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1959 was 500, of which 229 were received from Greenwich, and 193 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 Is. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. 31 Six persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1959. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People On the Ist April, 1959, Miss P. A. D. Ellison, appointed by the Council to visit sick and infirm aged people, commenced her duties. Through the medium of regular visiting and co-operation with other organisations concerned with old peoples welfare, patients requiring medical and other attention have been found quickly and any appropriate action promptly taken. From letters of appreciation that have been received in the Public Health Department it is obvious that this new service is very much appreciated by old people in the Borough. From the 1st April until the end of the year, 243 individual people wese visited and a total of 1,434 visits paid. From this number 45 had been taken off the list for various reasons, e.g., admission to hospital or home, removed from Borough, deaths, etc. and at the end of the year 198 people remained on the active visiting list. The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five "Darby and Joan" Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the District. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. I give details regarding our " Meals on Wheels' service which is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. Meals are provided to about 230 old people each week. The meals are obtained from the United Girls Schools for Social Services at a cost of 1s. 8d. per meal, for which the individuals pay 10d. and the London County Council pay a subsidy of lOd. per meal. The Council pay the United Girls Schools monthly for the cost of the meals. 12,334 meals were provided during the year. The Deptford Borough Council maintain a vehicle (which was presented by a local fiim) and provide a driver, to deliver meals twice a week to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to "Darby and Joan" Clubs. The W.V.S. provide the helpers for delivery of meals. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Public Health Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Six applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 44 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Fifty-five examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Registration of Hairdressers' Premises Fifty-five premises are registered under Section 18(1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. Occasional inspections are made to ensure that the bye-laws are observed. Vaccination Certificates One hundred and eighty-six certificates by Medical Practitioners in respect of people travelling abroad were authenticated. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for Promotion of Health —Harrogate. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor R. S. Marriott, J. P.) and the Medical Officer of Health. 34 National Society for Clean Air—London Councillor F. W. Bullion and Mr. A. C. Webster, Chief Public Health Inspector. Sanitary Inspectors' Association—Margate. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee and Mr. H. E. Green, Public Health Inspector. 35 APPENDIX TABLE I Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life During 1959 in the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford Causes of Death Sex AGE All Ages 0-1 years 5-15 years 5-15 years 25-56 years 45-65 years 65-75 years 75 years & over 15-25 years M - 1 - - 1.
