With Table of Causes of Death, &c. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerlcenwell. Gentlemen, In the present, which is my Twelfth Annual Report, I shall lay before you, the usual statistical account of the health and the mortality of the district. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes during the yoar, was 1497. The average number of deaths for the last eleven years was 1520; the deaths were thus 23 below the average. 13 The absolute number of deaths which took place during each of the past eleven years is appended below; with the number of births for the same years, and the averages: Deaths. Births. In 1857 1406 2219. 1858 1477 2220. 1859 1374 2175. 1860 1383 2279. 1861 1494 2295. 1862 1572 2287. 1863 1509 2449. 1864 1735 2224. 1865 1613 2389. 1866 1661 2434. 1867 1497 2452. Average 1520 2311. Births. Deaths. First Quarter 615 427 Second „ 643 353 Third ,, 591 347 Fourth „ 603 370 2452 1497 During the year, a certain number of deaths, properly referable to this district, occur in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The number of these estimated for the year 1867, amounts to 111. As the number of deaths in 1866 was 1661, that for 1867 was 164 less than last year. On examining the above table, it will be seen, that the births were 141 more than the average, and 18 more than in the preceding year ; 615 taking place in the first quarter; 643 in the second; 591 in the third ; and 603 in the fourth. The excess of births over the deaths, or the natural increase of the population, amounts to 955, In 1866, this increase amounted to 773. The number of deaths from Zymotic diseases in 1867, was 292, the average for the last 10 years being 370. Hence these deaths were 50 less than in the preceding year, and 78 below the average. 14 The number of deaths which took place from the principal Zymotic diseases, was 269; the separate diseases and numbers are indicated in the subjoined table: Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus. (In Fever Hospital) Totals.

The number of deaths which took place from all causes in infants and children under the age of five years, was 663; the numbers for each of the last ten years having been 663, 656, 628, 624, 707. 724, 728, 789, 700, and 736; the average being 695. 331 deaths occurred at and above 60, including 44 at and above 80. 280 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases, the number for the preceding year being 295. 15 32 deaths occurred in the House of Correction, and 5 in the House of Detention; the numbers for the preceding year being respectively 29 and 2. 186 deaths took place in the Workhouse; the numbers for the last Eight years having been 120, 137, 160, 172, 158, 167, 174, and 156. The Accidental deaths were 17, against 20 in 1866; viz: 3 from fractures and contusions; 2 from burns and scalds; and 12 from suffocation of infants. 4 deaths arose from murder; and 9 from suicide, viz; 1 from a wound; 6 from hanging; and 2 from falls from a height. 115 inquests were held during the year, including the 37 upon prisoners who died in the prisons. The further particulars of the deaths are given in the table which is appended to this Eeport. It is evident, that the year has been a decidedly favorable one, in a sanitary point of view; both the general mortality, as well as that arising from Zymotic diseases, being below the average. The mortality from Small Pox has been unusually great, and the number of cases of the disease prevailing in the parish must have been very large. As a new Act of Parliament has been passed in regard to the enforcement of Vaccination, it is to be hoped that the deaths from this disease will cease to present a prominent figure. As the Small Pox was very prevalent in the spring of the year, the usual hand bills were posted, directing attention to the importance of vaccination, and indicating the addresses and hours of attendance of the publio vaccinators. Typhus has also caused a large mortality. How this is attributable to ill-constructed habitations, and too crowded a state of the occupants, may be well illustrated by an outbreak which occured in Union Place. This is a very narrow court surrounded by high houses, closed at both ends by walls, save at a narrow doorway. The seven houses are tworoomed, the rooms very small, and without back ventilation. They were occupied by 30 persons; and among these occurred 17 cases of Typhus, and 4 deaths ; 3 of them arising in parents of families. Until more energetic measures are taken to diminish the overcrowding of the poorer inhabitants, and to give them proper breathing space in their dwellings, there will be little chance of keeping down the mortality from this disease. Much also constantly requires to be done, in enforcing the more cleanly state of the apartments occupied by the poorer classes. In many cases, I believe these evils will be more effectually remedied, by serving 16 notices upon the occupiers of the rooms under the Sanitary Act, instead of upon the owner of the premises. Slaughter-houses. In November, the Slaughter-houses were duly inspected by the Sanitary Committee. They were 34 in number, kept by 33 butchers. They were found to be in good order. Cow-houses. These were examined at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They numbered 27, kept by 24 cow-keepers; the number of cows being 270. Various nuisances connected with them were ordered to be removed. Bake-houses These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee in the spring of the year. They were 72 in number, and were in fair order. But it appeared to me, that some of them were not in so cleanly a condition as was to be expected; perhaps in consequence of their not having been inspected last year. Sanitary Improvements- During the year, the following Sanitary Improvements were effected, viz:—204 feet of pipe-sewer were laid down; 22 sewers were cleansed; 6 new gullies were constructed, 25 trapped, and 274 cleansed; 31 house drains were laid down, and 38 houses drained; 19 cesspools were destroyed, and waterclosets substituted for them; 218 loads of soil were removed from the sewers and gullies, and 2 new urinals erected,—1 in Cobham Row, and 1 in Bowling Green Lane. A large number of house-cleansings and other removals of nuisances were also effected during the year; and the closets in many of the courts and alleys were flushed with disinfectants. Clerkenwell Explosion. I must not conclude, without noticing this most diabolical outrage, which occurred on the 13th of December, in Corporation Lane, and rended the country with its attendant horrors. It cannot be summed up in better words than those of the "Times," viz:— "By the terrific violence of the explosion in a confined and crowded locality, 7 persons were killed outright; 6 more died from its effects according to the coroner's inquests; 5 in addition owe their deaths indirectly to this means; one young woman is in a mad-house; 40 mothers were prematurely confined, and 20 of their babes died from the effects of the explosion on the women; while others of the children are dwarfed and unhealthy. One mother is now a raving maniac; 120 persons were wounded; 50 went into St. Bartholomew's, Gray's Inn Lane, and King's College Hospitals; 15 are permanently injured, with loss of eyes, legs, 17 ???ms, etc.; besides £20,000 worth of damage to person and property ch was the horrifying and pitiable devastation caused by that one rrel of gunpowder." The meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1867. Temperature, mean. Difference from mean of 96 years. Dew Point. Humidity ( Saturation=100.) Height of Barometer. Rain, in Inches. Difference from average ef 52 years. Year 48.6 +0.2 43 82 29.79 28.4 +0.8 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., March) 38.9 +0.4 34.1 83 29.67 6.3 +1.5 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 53.5 +1.3 46.1 76 29.76 6.3 +0.5 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 59.7 +0.1 52.9 79 29.82 11.3 +3.9 Lutumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 42.5 —1. 390 88 29.91 4.5 —2.6 Hence all the quarters of the year were warmer than the average, cept that of the autumn.
