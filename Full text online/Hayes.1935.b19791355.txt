To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Hayes and Harlington. Mr. Chairman, Madam and Gentlemen, In presenting to you my Annual Report on the health of this Urban District, I have to report no abnormal cause of illness during the past year. The death-rate is much below the average for England and Wales, the corrected rate being 8.78 per 1,000 population as against 11.7 for the whole country. I should like to repeat my thanks to the members and officials of the Council for their interest and support in the discharge of my duties. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, J. STANLEY LLOYD, Medical Officer of Health. SECTION A. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 5,161 Population (Census, 1931) 23,646 Population (Mid-year, 1935) Registrar-General's Estimate-Working Population Figure 31,560 Present estimated population at 4.1 persons per house 35,400 Number of inhabited houses end of 1935 8,634 Rateable value £214,048 Sum represented by a penny rate Gross £905 Net (Est.) £804 SOCIAL CONDITIONS. The Urban District of Hayes and Harlington comprises the parishes of Hayes, Harlington and that portion of Cranford to the west of the River Crane. As time goes on the land devoted to agriculture and horticulture becomes increasingly encroached upon, so that the progress towards complete urbanisation is becoming very rapid. The height above sea level varies from 182 feet at Charville Lane to 70 feet at the point below the bridge where the Bath Road crosses the Crane. There is an area of 344 acres devoted to parks and open spaces and in addition an area of 22 acres of garden allotments. The houses are nearly all of modern construction and there are no slums.

GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. No alteration has been made in the health services of this area during 1935. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY. The Staff of the Public Health Department consists of one part-time Medical Officer and two Sanitary Inspectors, the Chief Sanitary Inspector being also the Inspector under the Petroleum Acts and Shops Acts. The Chief Sanitary Inspector holds the special Meat and Food Inspector's Certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute, and the other Officer has also passed an examination in meat inspection. Contributions to the salaries of these Officers are received under the Public Health Acts. 8 The Medical Officer (Dr. Bousfield) in charge of the Diphtheria Immunisation Clinic is paid on a sessional basis. A clerk was appointed to the Public Health Department on the 1st April, 1935. Hospitals.—Hospital accommodation in this area is adequate. The Urban District Council contributes the equivalent of a penny rate to the Hayes Cottage Hospital, and the Harlington Cottage Hospital, the contributions being apportioned according to the rateable value of the respective parishes. There has been no change in laboratory facilities, hospitals, ambulance facilities, or existing clinics and treatment centres. A District Nurse was appointed to Harlington during the year. The parish of Hayes has had the services of a District Nurse for several years. Diphtheria Immunisation.—A free Clinic was commenced in October for the testing and immunisation of children against diphtheria. Those children are eligible whose parents are insured under the National Health Insurance or who have incomes which would entitle them to benefit if they were insurable. The clinic is under the direction of Dr. Guy Bousfield, and meets at the Hayes Cottage Hospital on Saturday mornings. Up to the end of 1935 429 attendances had been recorded. SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water.—Three samples of water from private wells have been submitted for bacteriological examination, the results of which are set out in the schedule. A marked improvement has been shown in the water from one of the private wells and it is now considered reasonably safe for drinking purposes. No samples have been taken from the piped supplies of statutory undertakers. Drainage and Sewerage.—The northern half of the district is drained to the Minet Drive Disposal Works, where the sewage is treated in continuous flow sedimentation tanks followed by percolating filters and humus tanks. A large extension of the 9 sewerage system in the northern part of the district was completed in 1934, when the Hayes Gate pumping station was enlarged and equipped with modern electrically driver pumps and automatically operated raking apparatus. A comprehensive scheme of sewerage for Harlington and for the relief of the heavily charged system in the Hayes Industrial Area was completed in 1934. New sewers are in course of construction for the sewerage of land to the east of Coldharbour Lane, Hewen's Road, the rubber factory at Hayes Gate, Watersplash Lane, Bath Road and Hatton Road. Arrangements are now complete for the discharge by gravity of the sewage for the whole district into the West Middlesex trunk sewers. It is anticipated that connection will be effected to the trunk sewers by the end of the present year, when the sewage disposal works will be superseded. A sample of water taken from an open land drain, which had been the cause of repeated complaints, was submitted for bacteriological examination. Although the examination failed to show any cause for the smells complained of, the owners of the drain were persuaded to have it covered in. Closet Accommodation.—Every house connected with the sewer has a water-closet provided with flushing apparatus. Of the premises not connected with the sewer a number have water-closets and the remainder pail-closets, the cleansing of which is undertaken by the Council. During the year 1,126 new water-closets have been constructed. No conversions from conservancy to water carriage system have been carried out. The estimated numbers of the various types of accommodation at the end of 1935 are:— Water-closets 9,623 Privies (movable receptacles) 204 Privies (fixed receptacles) 13 Public Cleansing.—House refuse is collected once a week by closed freighters and tipped at Yeading Dump, where it is covered with dead ash or earth. This covering is applied every day so that no part of the dump is left open for any appreciable time. Pail-closets are emptied weekly and cesspools at longer intervals, the contents being discharged into the sewers. 10 SUMMARY OF REPORTS OF WATER SAMPLES SUBMITTED FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION, 1935. Report No. Source and Date. Organisms produced on gelatine plates incubated at 20° C. for 3 days. Organisms produced on agar plates incubated at 37.5° C. for 2 days. B. Coli. Streptococci. B. Enter itidis Sporogenes. Remarks. 19003. 24, Clayton Road. 5/4/35. 879 per c.c. 703 per c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. Excremental organisms are not found and there is no evidence of sewage pollution. If used in a dairy it would be necessary to avoid contact of the raw water with the milk or dairy utensils. It contains numerous chromogenic bacteria, chiefly of the b. phorescens type; these grow fairly readily in milk and might impart a yellowish tint to it. They are not dangerous but might develop in warm weather enough colour to make the milk unsightly. The water is not of first quality but could be used for drinking. 30407. Pink well Cottages. 13/6/35. 214 per c.c. 62 per c.c. Present in 5 c.c. Present in 30 c.c. Present in 100 c.c. The bacterial counts are not very high for a shallow well but the qualitative part of the examination reveals the presence of considerable numbers of excremental organisms. It is possible that these are derived from surface water pollution and attention to the brickwork might correct this. At present the water is not satisfactory for drinking purposes and if no alternative supply is available the water should be boiled previous to dietetic use. 52980. Pink well Cottages. 29/10/35. 132 per c.c. 11 per c.c. Present in 25 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. The water contains only a small number of b. coli and they are not associated with other excremental organisms. Taking the result as a whole the water might be regarded as reasonably safe for drinking purposes. SANITARY INSPECTION OF AREA. 1.—Complaints.
