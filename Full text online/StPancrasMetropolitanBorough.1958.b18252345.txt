September, 1959 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my annual report for the year 1958. This is the 15th' report on the health of the Borough of St. Pancras which it has been my privilege to prepare. Population The population in the middle of the year, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 130,800, as compared with 132,000 in 1957. At the census in 1951, the population was 138,377. There has therefore been a steady decrease in the residential population of the borough. The census also showed that 84,105 persons entered the Borough daily to work or to study. This means that the Council is responsible for a population of 222,482. Members of the Council will be aware of the extent of commercial development in the Borough in the last seven years, and I have no doubt that the number of individuals for which the Council is now responsible exceeds this figure considerably. This influx of population which is common to Central London boroughs, calls for additional work in connection with factory and food hygiene. Food Hygiene I have called attention to the fact that the presence of three main line termini in the Borough is associated with the receipt in St. Pancras of large quantities of food, much of which is stored in the vicinity of the stations prior to widespread distribution. It is not surprising, therefore, that your Public Health Department must ensure that the majority of its Public Health Inspectors are experts in the hygiene of food, i. e. that they hold the Meat and Other Poods certificate of the Royal Society of Health. Supervision is inadequate without the co-operation of all those concerned in the food trade and, by and large, this co-operation has been forthcoming throughout the years I have been Medical Officer of Health to the Borough. It would be unrealistic if I were to say that the conditions are satisfactory in all respects. They are not, for St. Pancras is an old Borough containing much out-moded property. In many cases we rely on improvement and improvisation rather than demolition and new construction. Many of the restaurants are owned and managed by persons whose residence in England has not been of long standing. We have found them willing to learn and to improve their premises in accordance with our requests and our teaching. i Health Education The Public Health Inspector, whether he be a District Inspector, a Factory Inspector, a Food Inspector or in control of other special branches of public health work has a far greater responsibility than that of inspection, the service of notices and the taking out of summonses. His most valuable duty is to give good advice and to teach those responsible how to abate nuisances in the quickest and most economic way and to impart knowledge of better standards of hygiene in the home the shop, the restaurant and the place of work. To some extent the service of a summons in an acknowledgment of failure failure to make the responsible person understand his obligations to those who live in his property, or who work for him, or buy from him. It would be wrong to measure success by the number of Court proceedings. In fact, Court proceedings are diminishing year by year. This, however, is to some extent due to the fact that, as a result of recent legislation, the Council has been enabled to take action and remedy nuisances itself. This procedure is adopted wherever the nuisance or '"defective state" is of an urgent character. Many other nuisances, less urgent, are remedied by the Borough Council where the landlord has failed, on account of financial or other difficulties, to comply with sanitary notices. The following table shows, for the past ten years, the number of summonses, the number of cases where the Council has done the work in default of the owner and the sums of money involved:- 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 Summonses 117 194 230 165 144 117 104 62 50 Work in default Cases - - - - 9 5 26 45 62 Cost - - - - £849 £677 £1,677 £2,299 £1,783 Finance The rateable value of the district has increased from £3, 388,177 in April, 1957, to £3,464,582 in April, 1958, whilst the product of the 1d rate has increased from £13.260 to £13.800. Meteorological 1958 was a rainy year, with 32.99 inches of rainfall, compared to 22.35 inches in 1957 and it rained on 167 days, as compared to 154 days in 1957. Vital Statistics The number of live births in 1958 was 2, 280 as compared with 2,227 in 1957, the birth rate being 17 43 per cent. as compared to 16.87 per cent. in 1957. ii There were 54 deaths in children under the age of one year - an infantile death rate of 23.68 per 1,000 live births. This is an increase on 1957 when there were 47 deaths and the infantile mortality rate 22.10. During the course of the year there were 1,426 deaths. Of these, diseases of the heart and blood vessels accounted for 421, bronchitis 129, and cancer in all forms, 320. As tuberculosis becomes more curable, we are able to give more attention to other diseases of the respiratory system, in particular bronchitis. This is a disease which is probably commoner in England than most other countries and commoner in the north of England than in the south. It may be associated with our climate; it may also be associated with pollution of the atmosphere. In the past, one has associated the work of a health department largely with conditions which are infectious. I think, in the future, we must look to the prevention of bronchitis, diseases of the heart and blood vessels and cancer in particular of the respiratory tract. We already have some knowledge as to the conditions which cause these diseases, e.g. pollution of the atmosphere in the case of bronchitis, smoking in the case of cancer of the lung and stress as a cause of heart disease. Public Health Departments must play their part in helping to diminish and abate these factors in modern civilisation which are inimical to health. Public Health Annexe During the course of the year we completed the Annexe to the Coroner's Court, providing there adequate accommodation for the Coroner s officers, rooms for the public, barristers, solicitors and expert witnesses and a modern flat for the mortuary keeper. I show in this report the entrance to the Coroner's Court from Camley Street, and a photograph of the post-mortem room. Co operation Co-operation with the General Practitioners of the Borough has continued on the happiest lines. It is my practice now to send to each doctor weekly, a report showing the number of cases of infectious disease, notifiable or otherwise, that have occurred in the Borough and I include a note of any matter affecting the health of the district. By this means, our doctors are aware of the trend of infectious diseases and I am assured that this has helped them considerably in the diagnosis of difficult cases. May I say immediately that no Medical Officer of Health could have a happier relationship with his colleagues or better co-operation than I enjoy in the Borough of St. Pancras and I would take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude and thanks to every one of my medical colleagues for their contribution and help, not only to me, but to the sick and healthy in the Borough. iii Steps leading to Coroner's Court.

Poliomyelitis The number of cases of poliomyelitis notified during the year was 4, of which two were paralytic. The diagnosis in the other two cases was not confirmed. Up to the end of June, 1959, there had been notified 5 cases, of which 3 were paralytic, one of whom died. iv Dr. Tracy and I have continued our very keen interest in the prevention of this disease. We have followed the literature on the subject very closely, both that of this country and, in particular, the United States of America. Response to the offer of immunisation which had been slow at the beginning, speeded up towards the end of the year, and in 1959 the acceptance rate amongst adolescents has increased considerably. This was largely due to the unfortunate death from poliomyelitis of a prominent footballer, which awakened the public to the dangers of poliomyelitis in adult life and caused older age groups to seek the only protection which we are as yet able to offer, that is, the Salk vaccine, be it made in England, Canada or the United States of America. At the time of writing this report, the supplies of the poliomyelitis vaccine are adequate. It is an ironic thought that, had young Jeff Hall, the footballer, asked to be immunised, it would have been refused him for he was over 26 years of age. I hope that the Government will find it possible very shortly to increase the offer of immunisation to all individuals up to the age of 40. Dr. Tracy and I have done our best to secure that the expectant mother shall seek immunisation against poliomyelitis, for to them immunisation is available irrespective of age. We do this for two reasons - in the first place the risk of contracting poliomyelitis appears to be increased during pregnancy and when it does occur, it is often in a severe form. Furthermore, the immunised mother, whether such immunity is acquired naturally or by means of vaccine, passes on to her child such immunity as she possesses herself. Admittedly the baby loses this immunity within the first few months of life, but so far it has not been possible to immunise children under the age of six months. Either their capacity to form antibodies has not yet developed sufficiently or, alternatively, the presence of the antibodies acquired from their mothers interferes with the antibody formation which the poliomyelitis vaccine induces in older persons. The only protection against poliomyelitis we can therefore give to the young baby is that which we can help it to inherit from its immunised mother. I think if mothers realised that they were not only protecting themselves, but also their new-born babies by securing immunisation during pregnancy, it would not be long before all our expectant mothers asked for this protection. Smoke Control In my report for 1957, I reported on the first smoke control area which I had represented in the Borough of St. Pancras. On the 27th February, 1959, the Minister confirmed the Order, which will come into operation on the 1st September, 1959. This has thrown a considerable volume of work upon the Public Health staff, for notices have to be sent, and visits paid to each resident in the area concerned who is burning other than smokeless fuel, to discuss with him and help him in making the necessary alterations to his home. This work is proceeding satisfactorily. In the meantime, a scheme has been prepared to make the whole of the Borough smokeless within a limited number of years and I set out a map showing the order in which it is proposed to represent various parts of the Borough:- v The Council will be aware that the major smoke nuisance in the Borough arises from the railway termini and depots. To attempt to create smokeless zones in such neighbourhoods would be unrealistic. We have every reason to believe that dieselisation and electrification will have proceeded far by the time we deal with those areas affected directly by railway smoke, and this is the reason why we are dealing with them later in our programme. In connection with smoke from the railways, your Public Health Committee and your officers have been in regular contact with the railway authorities. Various methods of curtailing the smoke nuisance pending dieselisation and electrification have been discussed, in particular, the use of a smokeless fuel on stationary engines under steam. These schemes have not proved as satisfactory as we had hoped. Apart from technical difficulties whereby resort to coal is required some time before an engine must be put into running use, it is found difficult to get complete separation of smokeless fuel from coal, even when the engines are stationary. Your Public Health Committee has this matter under constant review and, whilst the end of the smoke nuisance may be in sight, its curtailment pending the final outcome is a matter which is considered at almost every Public Health Committee meeting. Regular observation is kept on our stations and depots. St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged This work has continued as heretofor. At the time of writing this report, five nurses are employed full time in caring for elderly persons, advising them and preventing ill-health. The following table gives some idea of the scope of the work - 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 Number of visits by Health Officers 1,461 2,494 3,776 4,383 6, 120 5,662 8,518 8,397 Meals supplied to old people in their homes 9,335 9,914 9,447 9.074 9,396 9,889 9,501 7,510* Meal vouchers issued 788 3,498 4,136 6,815 6,703 8,060 7,353 7,158 Wireless sets supplied or re-issued 22 46 34 30 39 26 29 39 Chiropody No. of Clinics 32 121 198 317 352 413 387 437 New cases 136 136 215 287 282 237 181 317 Re-attendances 215 1,198 2,534 3,159 3,866 4,741 4,530 4, 939 Persons seen by doctor 266 521 509 543 452 389 459 468 Holidays Persons sent away each year 136 128 134 140 143 129 139 135 * 1,872 by Invalid Meals of London 5,638 by S. P. A. C. A. There was a lapse of four months prior to S. P. A. C. A. taking over. vi Much of my correspondence is now concerned with matters relating to the care of persons of retirement age. Unfortunately there are still many whose condition is such that little can be done for them other than to remove them to an institution. The object of S P A C A is to make such cases as few as possible, and primarily it sets out to keep the old healthy, comfortable and young in outlook. I know its success has been the pride of the Council and, I would assure you, of its officers. I would call attention to the purchase of S P A.C A 's first meals van, photographs of which are in this report. It has proved entirely successful and is providing 60 old persons who are house-bound with a hot meal five days a week. There is a plaque on the side of the van which bears the inscription - "This van was presented to the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged through the Lord Mayor's Air Raid Distress Fund, 1939-1940". The meals are prepared by and purchased from the Aerated Bread Company in Camden Road and I feel sure that S.P. A. C. A. would wish me to express their thanks to the Directors for their cooperation and their kindly help. Each Saturday morning we are presented with a menu and from this we choose the meals for the week. The following is a typical menu:- Monday Stewed Beef or Roast Leg of Lamb, Mint Sauce New Potatoes Peas Steamed Jam Roll Tuesday Steak and Mushroom Pie or Boiled Silverside of Beef New Potatoes Cabbage Apple Tart and Custard Wednesday Roast Beef and Yorkshire Pudding or Fried Pork Chop New Potatoes Runner Beans Swiss Apple Tart and Custard Thursday Roast Leg of Lamb, Mint Sauce or Minced Beef and Tomato Roast Potatoes Cabbage Plum Tart and custard Friday Fried Fillet of Fish Chipped Potatoes Peas Rice Pudding and Prunes By the end of the year many thousands of meals had been provided, with literally not one single complaint - with the exception of one old lady who stated that the meal was more than she could eat! Each individual knows approximately the time at which his or her meal will be delivered and very often our staff are met at the doorstep with grateful expectation, or in many cases the recipient provides our staff with a key so that entrance is not delayed. I think vii S.P.A.C.A.'sJirst meals van. it is true to say that the staff who deliver the meals keep a general eye on the recipient and become his or her friend. Two other S.P.A.C A. services bring many letters of gratitude. The first is for holidays provided at Margate where our old people come under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Greves. Complaints are conspicuous by their absence. The second is in connection with the provision of wireless sets. We have out on loan 104 wireless sets to old people. Gratitude here is expressed in a different way. When a set is out of order the old person writes to us to ask us to get it repaired as quickly as possible, for life has become dreary and monotonous without the presence and entertainment of the wireless. If the radio is part of the normal equipment of every home to-day- it is even more the necessity of the old person, particularly if he lives alone. Without it his scope of life is limited to the four walls of his one and only room; without it he feels bereft of companionship. Conclusion and Thanks Admittedly, no report is complete without an acknowledgment to those who have helped the Medical Officer of Health in his work throughout the year. My thanks, however, are neither formal nor cursory. They are indeed sincere. No matter what has been the personnel nor, may I say, the political complexion of the Council, I have always received courtesy and help and once again my thanks are due to your Worship and the Aldermen and members of the Council and, in particular, to the Chairmen of the Committees with whom my work is primarily concerned. I would like to acknowledge my thanks to the Chairman and members of the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged - as happy a Committee as it has ever been my lot to serve. The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras is fortunate in the co-operation he receives not only from the medical practitioners of the Borough and the many hospitals within its boundaries, but in particular from his colleagues and the various Departments of the Council, from all those who are concerned with voluntary work in the Borough and the staff of the Public Health Department. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, DENNIS GEFFEN- Medical Officer of Health. viii METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

Failure to comply with this requirement renders the occupier liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council is required to forward the name and address of any outworker in this list whose address is not in St. Pancras to the local authority concerned. Section 111 applies to premises where work is carried on which, in the Council's opinion is injurious or dangerous to the health of the persons employed therein, and in such cases the Council is empowered to give notice of the circumstances, in writing, to the occupier of the factory. If, after the expiration of ten days, the occupier continues to give out work to those premises, he is guilty of an offence. A Schedule to the Act states that if the occupier of a factory knowingly allows a woman or girl to be employed therein within four weeks after she has given birth to a child, he shall be liable to a fine. If the occupier of a factory or his contractor allows wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired in any place where an inmate is suffering from scarlet fever or smallpox, and cannot prove that he was unaware of the existance of the disease, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10. The Council has power to forbid work being given out to premises where an inmate is suffering from an infectious disease, and an occupier or contractor upon whom such an order has been served shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10 if he contravenes such order.
