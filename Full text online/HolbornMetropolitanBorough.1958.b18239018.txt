The numbers of both males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have declined during these last ten years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table shows the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last seven years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 19 SECTION 3.

Notifications During the year 148 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 50 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 22). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1929-1958 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 24 and 25). Diphtheria Six cases were notified and were removed to hospital. One of these was rediagnosed "acute exudative tonsillitis." The remaining five notifications arose out of an "incident" involving children attending three schools in the E.C.1 district (Compton, Moreland and St. Catherine Labouré—of which the latter only is in this Borough). Numerous examinations of school and play contacts were made by the London County Council School Health Service, and the germs of diphtheria were found in the throats of these five children living in Holborn, chiefly on the Bourne Estate. These were dealt with by the School Health Service. Ultimately, the five notified Holborn cases were discharged from hospital, and four of them were rediagnosed as tonsillitis occurring in a diphtheria carrier, leaving one case, the final diagnosis of which was "Diphtheria (tonsillar and nasal)." Bacteriologically, the strain was described as a virulent "mitis" variety, and it is interesting to note that although some twenty children from the three schools involved were admitted to hospital, only two showed anything like a typical diphtheritic throat, and neither of them was seriously ill. Dysentery Thirty cases were notified, and five were removed to hospital. Nineteen cases were the result of an outbreak of Shigella sonnei infection in the Kingsway Creche involving fourteen children and five staff. Numerous swabs were taken and examined by the Central Laboratory, County Hall, the positive cases being excluded from the Creche under care of their own doctors until three consecutive negative specimens had been produced. Only one of the nineteen persons involved went to hospital, and this child, one of the early cases, was subsequently discharged as "Bacillary dysentery (Sonne) Contact carrier." Enteric Fever No cases were notified during the year. Erysipelas One case was notified and was treated at home. 21 Food Poisoning Eleven cases were notified, and three of them were removed to hospital. In each of these three cases the patient was not resident in Holborn. In one of the remaining eight cases the food suspected was Shepherd's Pie, but bacteriological examination failed to trace any pathogenic organisms. Malaria One case was notified and was treated at home. The patient, who had recently arrived from Pakistan, had suffered a recurrent attack. Measles Fifty-six cases were notified and eight were removed to hospital. Meningococcal Infection No cases were notified during the year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum No cases were notified during the year. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal) Two cases of acute primary pneumonia were notified, and one case was removed to hospital. There was no notification of acute influenzal pneumonia. Poliomyelitis Four cases were notified, all of which were removed to hospital. Only one of these cases was a Holborn resident. Puerperal Pyrexia No cases were notified during the year. Scabies Three cases were notified, and were treated at home. Scarlet Fever Nine cases were notified, and one of them was removed to hospital. Smallpox No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year. Tuberculosis See page 51. Whooping Cough Three cases were notified, all of which were treated at home.

This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.1, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 220 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease Positive Negative Total Diphtheria — 22 22 (Nasal and throat swabs) Dysentery (Faeces) 26 171 197 (Faecal swabs) 16 44 60 Food Poisoning (Faeces) 5 17 22 (Other specimens) — 2 2 Salmonella typhi (Faecal swabs) — 3 3 (Agglutination tests) — 3 3 Streptococcus haemolyticus 8 1 9 Vincents organisms 2 4 6 Other pathogenic organisms 4 8 12 Infectious Disease Contacts Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. One such certificate was issued during the year in respect of a dysentery contact living outside Holborn, but engaged as a canteen assistant in the Borough. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 582 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 422 were in respect of smallpox, 97 for cholera and 63 for typhoid, Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 160 Holborn children completed immunisation against diphtheria. 24,25 TABLE No. 7 Comparative Figures of Infectious Disease for the last 30 years Disease 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 (Population) 38,380 38,380 34,470 36,440 36,050 36,000 35,400 34,850 34,600 34,350 30,660 23,470 17,160 16,580 17,240 18,020 18,680 21,190 23,460 24,960 25,490 25,930 24,540 23,950 23,710 23,340 23,060 22,640 22,230 21,870 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 72 80 69 76 75 74 93 60 76 49 19 7 14 17 17 5 11 12 3 2 1 2 - - - - - - - 1 Dysentery 2 — 2 1 — 2 6 6 10 10 - — — — 2 13 2 6 — 4 — 2 34 9 8 34 4 7 16 30 Encephalitis Lethargica 1 1 — 1 1 1 1 - - - 2 - - - - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - Enteric Fever 5 4 4 4 1 3 2 2 — — 1 1 3 1 6 1 — 1 1 1 — 1 — 2 1 2 — — 4 — Erysipelas 22 29 17 17 19 12 18 19 10 15 13 12 3 7 3 8 3 4 8 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 — — 1 Food Poisoning Notifiable as from 12th July, 1932. 11 5 — 3 5 2 - - - - - - 1 — 1 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 12 1 2 11 Malaria 1 — — 1 1 1 3 2 3 — 1 - - - 1 - - - - - - 1 1 — 1 1 — — — 1 Measles Notifiable as from 9th S eptem ber, 19 38. — 8 39 34 58 219 33 103 107 157 87 170 137 254 133 195 37 172 71 99 56 Meningococcal Infection — — 4 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 7 7 1 1 — 1 2 2 - - - - - 2 1 2 2 1 — Ophthalmia Neonatorum 6 5 7 4 6 6 4 3 3 5 4 4 1 5 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 2 — 2 3 — 1 — — — Pneumonia (Acute primary & Acute-influenzal) 89 49 40 28 37 38 21 30 34 21 28 14 18 20 22 14 6 17 15 9 9 5 8 4 4 4 — 3 4 2 Polio-encephalitis Acute - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - — 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - Poliomyelitis Acute — 1 1 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 — 5 1 2 2 — 6 17 3 12 6 11 4 *Puerperal Fever 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 4 — — — 1 2 2 2 2 — 1 1 * * * * * * * * * * Puerperal Pyrexia 5 6 4 6 5 2 4 3 2 2 3 3 2 7 3 1 4 5 5 2 4 2 3 1 - - - - - - Scabies Notifiable as from 1st Au gust, 1 943. 54 99 125 106 43 16 4 3 4 3 6 1 5 5 1 3 Scarlet Fever 130 90 57 57 96 115 50 67 38 59 56 20 16 23 30 20 14 24 29 13 15 16 21 18 10 5 4 4 8 9 Smallpox 43 14 3 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculosis Pulmonary 76 76 80 73 50 83 68 77 66 71 64 44 47 45 51 41 59 55 47 39 42 39 45 46 48 32 40 33 32 25 Tuberculosis, Non-Pulmonary 12 10 8 16 9 6 5 13 10 8 5 3 6 8 3 9 9 5 4 8 6 5 — 2 3 4 4 3 — 2 Whooping Cough 153 33 44 108 23 65 99 76 60 53 71 7 42 48 38 30 11 43 23 74 5 90 33 32 62 6 1 22 6 3 618 401 342 408 335 412 379 365 322 296 278 161 194 242 456 280 364 392 348 268 269 311 406 261 366 133 258 157 184 148 *Ceased to be notifiable as from 30th July, 1948, 26 SECTION 4.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. No complaints regarding unsatisfactory water being supplied for drinking purposes, were received during the year. Drainage During the year 3,005 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 116 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 101 Combined Drainage Orders were made. In 5 cases, consent was given to the carrying out of work on the single stack system of drainage. L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1953—Part II Discharge of trade effluent into sewers. Empowers the London County Council and Borough Councils to control the volume and content of new or modified effluents proposed to be discharged from trade premises into sewers. 30 During 1958, 11 notifications were received concerning the proposed discharge of trade effluents. In 7 cases notices of proposed conditions were issued by this Council and in none of these cases were counter proposals received. In one case the effluent was such as not to warrant a notice. In the remaining three cases, the premises concerned were connected to the London County Council's sewers, and the notifications were dealt with by that authority. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year 38 complaints were received regarding smoke emissions and 374 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Public Health Inspectors. The routine of making special observations from the roofs of four tall buildings was continued, and as in previous years these observations were helpful in checking the behaviour of boiler plant, especially in connection with plant installed in the many new buildings which have been erected. Most of the new installations however, are oil fired and consequently little trouble from smoke is experienced. Measurement of Deposited Matter and Sulphur Dioxide Since 1953 these forms of pollution have been recorded each month by means of apparatus installed on the roof of the British Museum. The apparatus consists of a deposit gauge for collecting rainwater and deposited matter, and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The recordings obtained during 1958 were as follows:— Month Rainfall Monthly deposit—Tons per sq. mile Mg. of S03/day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch A Pb02 inches pH value Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 1.76 5.1 10.72 15.43 26.15 6.37 February 2.06 5.2 8.93 9.35 18.28 5.60 March 0.89 5.8 12.65 12.41 25.06 5.44 April 1.84 5.3 7.05 7.75 14.80 4.38 May 2.02 5.7 13.56 7.21 20.77 3.52 June 5.33 6.0 10.23 10.33 20.56 3.17 July 1.87 6.3 7.88 9.66 17.54 2.21 August 3.65 6.3 5.95 16.44 22.39 2.41 September 3.24 6.1 10.81 9.46 20.27 3.57 October 2.12 6.3 10.27 8.95 19.22 4.14 November 1.73 5.3 9.46 10.64 20.10 5.70 December 2.66 4.8 8.15 12.96 21.11 6.37 Total 29.17 — 115.66 130.59 246.25 52.88 Monthly Average 2.43 5.7 9.64 10.88 20.52 4.41 31 The solid matter expressed in tons falling over the area of Holborn month by month was as follows:— Month Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 6.78 9.77 16.55 February 5.65 5.92 11.57 March 8.00 7.85 15.86 April 4.46 4.91 9.37 May 8.58 4.56 13.14 June 6.47 6.54 13.01 July 4.99 6.11 11.10 August 3.77 10.40 14.17 September 6.84 5.99 12.83 October 6.50 5.66 12.16 November 5.99 6.73 12.72 December 5.16 8.20 13.36 Daily Measurement of Suspended Matter During the latter part of 1955 apparatus for making daily estimations of smoke was installed by the Council at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, and at the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, Queen Square. The apparatus consists mainly of an air pump which draws a known volume of air from outside and passes it through a white filter paper.

There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. 37 During the year twelve cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £185 7s. 6d. The total amount recovered during the year in respect of burials was £211 17s. 4d. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources:— Coroner's Officer 5 French Hospital 3 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 3 St. Paul's Hospital 1 New Legislation Local Government Act, 1958 This Act provides inter alia for the payment of a general grant to local authorities in lieu of grants previously paid for specific purposes. Included in the latter are grants payable under section eleven of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, and the grants payable under subsection five of section twenty-nine of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, towards the repayment of sums paid by way of compensation in respect of milk which is infected or suspected of being infected.

Water Act, 1958 Enables the Minister of Housing and Local Government to make provision for dealing with an existing or threatened serious deficiency of supplies of water, because of exceptional shortage of rain. Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958 These Regulations which came into operation on the 1st June, 1958, specify the limits of emissions of smoke which may be left out of account for the purpose of section one of the Clean Air Act, 1956. Clean Air Act, 1956 (Appointed Day) Order, 1958 This Order brought into operation on the 1st June, 1958, those provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, not already brought into operation by the Clean Air Act, 1956 (Appointed Day) Order, 1956. 38 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The SanitarAuthority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council.

"Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies.

Upon bsing satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 183 licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— Dealer's Licences Dealer's Supplementary Licences To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 30 24 To sell Pasteurised milk 45 24 To sell Sterilised milk 34 26 Milk—Bacteriological Examination During the year, 93 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. 16 of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and one to a Day Nursery. 45 Registration of Premises used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1958, one set of premises was registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 116 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year one application was received and approved for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream and 8 applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. Three sets of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and were removed from the register.

In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. Licensed Premises There are 76 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 81 inspections were carried out. In addition, 37 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing Act, 1953. 46 Food Sampling A total of 474 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Borough Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. 328 were formal samples and 146 were informal.
