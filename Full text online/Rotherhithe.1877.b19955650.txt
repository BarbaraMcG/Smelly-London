The following is an extract from the Will of the late Mr. John Sprunt, with reference to the said bequest, viz. :— "It is my wish and desire that after my decease, and that of my dear Wife Mary m Sprunt, to give as a legacy the sum of £200 Consols to the Churchwardens for the time being, for ever, of the Parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe, in the County of Surrey, to be invented in their names in the Government Stock of Great Britain, and I order and direct that the yearly interest or dividends thereof be paid to six poor widows of good character of the said Parish, on the 23rd day of December in every year, who shall have attained the age of years, share and share alike." The Vestry have caused the name of the late Mr. John Sprunt, and the particulars of his bequest to the written upon the benefaction Board in the Parish Church. During the past year, the vestry have investigated into the several Charities of this Parish. and taken steps to have new Trustees appointed to till up vacancies, where existing in the several trusts, with the following results viz. :- The Surviving Trustees of the £900 Consols belonging to the Ancient Free Charity and Amicable Schools, have appointed Messrs. John Bulmer, Edward James Talbot, and Robert Foottiti to be new Trustee, to act in conjunction with the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, Mr. Henry Ravenhill the other surviving trustee having retired, and the said stock has been transferred into the names of the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, and Messrs. John Bulmer, Edward James Talbot, and Robert Foottit, accordingly. 22 The Surviving Trustees of the Charity School, (in respect of the wharf late "Gaywood's" now held by the Thames Steam Ferry Company Limited) have appointed Messrs. Robert Foottit, Francis John Bisley, Thomas William Clarke, Edward James Talbot, George Mabbs, and John Allen to be new Trustees, and to act in conjunction with the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, and Messrs. John Bulmer, Daniel Serle, Edward John Cox, Edward Talbot, William Matthew Marshall, Robert Allen, and James Payne, the said surviving trustees. There being only five Surviving Trustees of the Poor's Land belonging to this Parish, situate respectively at Plaistow and Stratford, Essex, the Vestry, at a Meeting held on the 12th day of February, 1878, appointed Messrs. Robert Foottit, Samuel Brownfield, John Henry Morris, James Dawson, Ralph Westall Walker, Francis John Bisley, William Archer, Robert Talbot, Edward John Cox, Lewis Etheridge, James Powell, Edward James Talbot, John Streeton, Lawrence Stevens, George Mabbs, Christopher Case, Richard Brownly, James Payne, Thomas William Clarke, Alfred Thomas Hobman, John Allen, William Thomas Lover, George John Judge, George Lewis, William Willis, James Whitechurch, George Butcher, Samuel Chafen, Thomas Collins, James England, Samuel Short, James Parsons, Masterman Powell Mills, George Frederick Merralls, Ebenezer Watts, George William Nichols, Robert Thomas Nichols, Joseph Thomas Dobbs, Henry Rouse, William Houghton, John Bright, Edward Rendle and AVilliam Marillicr, to be new Trustees, and to act in conjunction with Messrs. William James Blake, Edward Talbot, Daniel Serle, John Bulmer, and James Robert Goodhew. the said surviving trustees. Messrs. Robert Thomas Nichols and Edward Rendle, have since declined to act as such Trustees, and Messrs. William James Blake and Robert Talbot have died. Messrs. John Bulmer and Francis John Bisley have been appointed Trustees of the sum of £168 1s. 0d., £3 percent. Consols, belonging to Embleton and Horncastle's Charities, in conjunction with the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck and Mr. Edward Talbot, the surviving Trustees, and the said stock has been transferred into the names of such Trustees. No alteration has been made in the Trustees of the Coat and Cloak Charity, the £200 Consols belonging to the Charity, therefore, still stands in the names of the present Trustees, viz.:—The Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, and Messrs. Daniel Serle, Edward John Cox, John Bulmer and William Russell. Messrs. Robert Foottit, Edward James Talbot and Francis John Bisley, were appointed Trustees of the sum of £544 15s. 4d., £3 per cent. Consols (known as Mr. J. Kidd's Gift,) in conjunction with the Rev. Edward Josselyn Beck, and Messrs. Robert Allen and John Bulmer, but in as much as it is contrary to the Rules of the Bank for Stock to be held in the names of more than four Trustees, no alteration has been made therein at present. 23 The income of this Gift ha- not yet come into the possession of the Rector and Churchwardens, the tenant for life being still alive, and of the age of 77 years or thereabouts. The Vestry have given directions for the preparation of a revised Statement of the Estate, Rent charge, Gifts, Grants and Charity School- belonging to this Parish, which will be published in due course. Miscellaneous. The Thames Steam Ferry adjoining Church Stairs, Rotherhithe, was formally opened by the Lord Mayor, of London, on the 31st day of October, 1877, on which occasion, the vestry caused a suitable address to be prepared and the same was presented to his lordship at the opening ceremony by Mr. Churchwarden Foottit on behalf of the vestry, the vestrymen and officers being in attendance, after which the Lord Mayor in his couch accompanied by the Vestrymen and Officers, was conducted across the Thames upon the company's ferry boat. The bill for the formation of a subway commencing at the Horns Stairs, passing under the bed of the River Thames and terminating on the opposite shore in the parish of Limehouse has passed into Law, but the promotors have taken no action at present for the carrying out of the scheme. In October 1877, the Vestry caused a memorial to the Metropolitan Hoard of Work- to be prepared, urging that the Board would take into immediate consideration, the question of the Tooley Street improvement, and the Jamaica Road and the Union Road improvements, with the view to the putting in force without delay the provisions of the Act referring thereto, and for the speedy carrying into effect of the said improvements. The aid memorial was presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 26.th day of October, 1877, by Messrs. Robert Foottit, Robert Allen, Henry Hayward, Thomas William Clarke, Lawrence Stevens, and James Powell, a deputation appointed by the Vestry for that purpose. The Vestry subsequently received the following reply from the Metropolitan Board of Works Metropolitan Board of Works, Spring Gardens, S.W. 15th November, 1877. Gentlemen, Referring to the Memorial presented to the Board by a Deputation from the Vestry of Rothcrhithe on the 26th ultimo, asking the Board to take in hand at once the widening of Tooley Street, and the Jamaica Road and nion Road, 24 improvements, I am directed to inform you that the Board has carefully considered the question of the order in which the various improvements authorised by the Act of last session should be carried out, and that it has been resolved to proceed in the first instance with the improvements at Islington, Hackney, Deptford Bridge, Camberwell and Peckham, and immediately after them to proceed with the Tooley Street and Jamaica Road improvements. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIED, Clerk of the Board. The Clerks of the Vestry of Rotherhithe, Paradise Street, S.E. The Vestry appointed a Deputation consisting of Messrs. Robert Foottit, Henry Hay ward, Edward John Cox, James Powell, Edward James Talbot, Robert Allen and Thomas William Clarke, to present a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works urging upon that Board, the pressing necessity for increased means of communication between the north and south sides of the River Thames, at a point below London Bridge, and on the 19th of October, 1877, the said Deputation in conjunction with Deputations from the Whitechapel District Board of Works and the Vestry of St. George's-in-the-East attended and presented the said Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works, when the Deputations were informed that the subject would be referred to that Board's Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration. The attention of the Vestrv having been called to a Bill to consolidate, and amend ... the law relating to the Public Health in the Metropolis which was introduced into the House of Commons by the President of the Local Government Board, during the session of 1877, in which were certain clauses which appeared to place the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis under the control of the Local Government Board, in the exercise of their functions as the sanitary authorities of their respective districts. The Vestry solicited the co-opertion of the Members of Parliament for the Borough of Southwark and for the County of Surrey, in opposing the objectionable clauses in the said bill, which was ultimately withdrawn from Parliament. Messrs. Robert Foottit, James Powell, and Henry Hayward were appointed by the Vestry as a Deputation to attend a conference of representatives of Vestries and District Boards, at the Lambeth Vestry Hall, Kennington Green, on the subject of the provisions of "The County Government Bill," the Deputation attended such conference on the 21st March, 1878, when the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— 25 "That in the opinions of this conference, it is requisite and essential having regard to the large amount of Population and Rateable Value of the following Parishes and Districts, viz.:— St. Gile's, Camberwell. St. Saviour's, Southwark District. Vestries of Newington and St. George-the- Martyr. St. Olave's, Southwark District. Vestries of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe. Lambeth. Wandsworth (part of.) Clapham. Streatham. That separate Petitions he presented by each Vestry and District Hoard, within the Newington Petty Sessional Division, praying that the Bill may be altered and amended by substituting as the unit of election of representative members to the County Board, the Vestries and District Boards, so far as they relate to the Metropolis, for the Petty Sessional Division, such Vestries and District Boards being corporate bodies under a common seal with the same duties and powers as Boroughs in a County. That in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable to exclude the Metropolis from the operation of the County Government Bill, unless a proviso is introduced by which the City of London and the metropolitan Parishes should be regarded as a separate and distinct County of I,ondon for the objects contemplated by the Bill, save and except as to Roads which are already provided for by the Metropolis Local Management Act. That application be made to the Right Honourable the President of the Local Government Hoard, requesting that he will be pleased to receive a Deputation relative to the preceding resolutions. The following is a copy of a letter received from the President of the Local Government Hoard, relative to the proposed deputation to him on the points raised at the before mentioned Conference of Vestries and District Hoards: 26 Local Government Board, Whitehall, April 2nd, 1878. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, and to state that the President has alreadyhad several representations made to him in connection with the points raised on the resolutions passed on the 21st ultimo, at the conference of Vestries and District Boards of Works, within the Newington Petty Sessional Division, relative to the provisions of the Countv Government Bill before Parliament, and the matter is now receiving his careful consideration. Under these circumstances it does not at present appear to him necessary to trouble the proposed Deputation to attend here. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, HUGH OWEN, Junr. T. Roffey, Esq., Assistant Secretrry. Vestry Hall, Kennington Green. The County Government Bill was not proceeded with. The report of the select committee of the House of Commons and the conclusions arrived at by the committee with reference to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Clause 2 of which is as follows :— "That the Fire Brigade should be transferred from the Metropolitan Board to the Commissioners of Police for the Metropolis, so, however, as to constitute a distinct branch to be placed under the immediate command of a separate assistant commissioner, and to be authorized to act within the City of London as well as in the metropolis," having been considered, the following resolutions thereon were passed by the Vestrv, viz.— "That this Vestry protest against the management of the Fire Brigade beingtransferred from the Metropolitan Board of Works to the Commissioners of Police for the Metropolis." "That the Clerks be instructed to write to the Members of Parliament for the eastern division of the County of Surrey, and for the Borough of Southwark, with a request that in the event of a Bill being brought into effect the proposed transfer, they will use their utmost exersions in opposing the same. The Vestry having had under consideration the following Bills introduce dinto Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the Session of 1878, viz.:— The Metropolis Waterworks (Purchase) Bill, and The Metropolis Water (New Works) Bill on the 5th February, 1878, the following resolution was passed by the Vestry on the subject viz. 27 "Resolved.—That this Vestry, while appoving of the action taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works to become the authority for the Water supply of the Metropolis, at the same time express the hope that steps will be taken by the Board, to charge the consumers in a more equitable manner than has been the case heretofore." The foregoing resolution was presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works, by Mr. John Tolhurst, the representative for this District. The Vestry being of opinion upon taking into consideration the very large increase in the population and ratepayers of this parish, since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act in 1855, that the time had arrived for the parish to be represented at the Metropolitan Board of Works by a member of its own, instead of electing a member of that board jointly with the District of St. Olave, the following resolution on the subject was passed by the Vestry and forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, viz. :— "Resolved.—That a letter be written to the Metropolitan Board of Works, urging that upon the Board introducing any bill into Parliament to amend the Metropolis Local Management Acts, a clause be inserted therein authorising the election of a member to represent this parish at that board alone, instead of conjointly with the District of St. Olave, Southwark. The following small improvements have been carried out by the Vestry during the past year, viz.:— On the re-erection of the houses, Nos. 165 and 166, Rotherhithc Street, the purchase of, and the throwing into the public footway, a slip of ground in front of the said houses ; also, The purchase of a piece of ground in Dodd's Place for the purpose of opening out of the south end of Neston Street, through Dodd's Place to Forsyth Street, &c. The boundaries of this parish were perambulated on the 10th May, 1877 (Holy Thursday), by the Churchwardens, Overseers, Vestrymen and inhabitants, when directions were given for the placing of new boundary stones and plates where required, which have been carried out. The following Bye Laws with reference to the reception of Deputations were made by the Vestry, on the 18th December, 1877:— "That no Deputation be received at any Meeting of this Vestry, unless three clear days, previous notice in writing be left at the office of the Clerks to the Vestry, of the intention of such deputation to attend thereat, such notice to be signed by one or more members of the deputation and to specify the object thereof. Also "That the Clerks be instructed to obtain the name of each member of a deputation in attendance and hand them in to the Chairman previous to the deputation being heard." 28 The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Under the provisions of the above Act, the total Assessment of properties in this Parish has been increased during the past year, as follows, viz.:— Gross Value. Rateable Value. From £230,530 0s. 0d. £186,493 0s. 0d. To £233,375 0s. 4d. £188,743 0s. 0d. APPENDIX No. 1. ANNUAL REPORT Of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. From 1st April, 1877, to March 31 st, 1878. The VESTRY of the PARISH of ROTHERHITHE, Surrey. Gentlemen, The events and circumstances connected with my department of duty during the year, extending from April 1st, 1877, to March 31st, 1878, differ so little from those which I have annually submitted to your notice on former occasions, that it will not be necessary to make many special remarks in this communication. A few months ago, there were indications that some means would be adapted by which the sanitary authorities would be immediately informed of the existence of every case of infectious disease, whether it occurred in public or private practice, and that better means would be discovered for rendering more effectual the isolation of patients suffering from such diseases, and although it is desirable that the impediments which hamper the action of the sanitary authorities in these matters should be removed, I cannot say that much progress has been made towards the settlement of these questions. 28 Altogether the annual mortality is above the average, and as is usually the case, the chief sufferers are children under two years of age; up to this period of life two hundred and seven deaths were registered, and one hundred and twenty-nine of these cases were attributed to some of the more important diseases of the zymotic class ; this kind of disease undergoes great fluctuation, and the prevailing epidemics have been measles and whooping cough. Fever.—Six fatal cases were registered: four typhoid and two typhus. The annual average number for ten years being nearly ten. Small Pox contributed seven deaths and the epidemic appears to have nearly ceased. Although severe, the number of deaths does not exceed one-third of that which occurred in the previous severe visitation. Scarlatina.—Seven deaths were registered from this cause. Twenty-six being the annual average number for ten years. Measles.—This disease has prevailed as an epidemic and destroyed thirty-one lives. The annual average number for ten years being thirteen. Whooping Cough has been more destructive to life than any other epidemic disease and caused fifty-nine deaths. The annual average number being about twentysix. Diarrhoea has been less fatal than usual—seventeen deaths were registered. Diphtheria was fatal in two cases. The following table will show the number of deaths which have occurred and the fluctuation observed, in some of the more important zymotic diseases during the last ten years.

Females. Total. From April 1, 1877, to .June 30, 1877 180 121 301 „ July 1, 1877, to September 30, 1877 151 172 323 „ October 1, 1877, to December 31, 1877 198 174 372 ,, January 1, 1878, to March 31, 1878 167 181 348 696 648 1344 Deaths.—The total number of deaths registered during the year amounted to seven hundred and ninety three, and the statement below will explain the number of deaths that occurred in each quarter of the year:— Males. Females. Total. From April 1, 1877, to June 30, 1877 83 109 192 ,, July 1, 1877, to September 30, 1877 86 75 161 „ October 1, 1877, to December 31, 1877 116 127 243 ,, January 1, 1878, to March 31, 1878 106 91 197 391 402 793 A deduction from the above number must bo made for the deaths of non-residents that have occurred in the St. Olave's Union Infirmary amounting to sixty-eight, also of thirty-one persons who were not parishioners upon whoso bodies coroner's inquests have Been held; thus the exact number will be reduced to six hundred and ninety-four, and if this number he compared with the six hundred and thirty deaths registered in the previous year, the increase will be found to amount to sixty-nine. This will raise the rate of mortality estimated by increasing population a little higher than usual, and it appears to be accounted for from the unusually fatal effects of two epidemic diseases, measles and whooping cough, the severity of chest affections, and the increase in the number of coroner's inquests. It is worthy of notice, that the death of a female was registered, aged 103. Comparative number of deaths during the last three years:— No. of Deaths. Corrected Mortality.
