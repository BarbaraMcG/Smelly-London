To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the health and environmental circumstances of Deptford. The estimated mid-year population of 71,840 indicates the continued decline of population in the Borough, but the Birth rate of 14.86 shows a slight increase. Unfortunately the Infant Mortality rate was 25-2 as compared with 11 -4 last year, the lowest ever recorded, but at that time I did mention that it was misleading to place great reliance on figures for one particular year since with the small numbers involved, wide statistical variations are inevitable from year to year. The Death rate was 13-2 partly accounted for by the large number of deaths of aged persons in the New Cross General Hospital which are credited to Deptford. Notifiable infectious diseases declined by 761, due almost entirely to the fact that measles was almost absent from the Borough. It was gratifying to note that whooping cough dropped from 114 cases to 79. However, Sonne Dysentery was very prevalent and 268 cases were notified. Cases began to be reported from early in the year and were originally connected closely with the local schools. The especially cold weather in February, resulting in the freezing up of water closets and ablutionary facilities, undoubtedly assisted in the spread of disease. Our experience in Deptford confirmed the general observation that the incidence in the 5-14 group had risen at the expense of the 0-5 group. By the beginning of the summer vacation the outbreak, had practically disappeared and only spasmodic cases were found. Reference is made in the body of the report to the work of the Public Health Department in tracing contacts, collecting specimens and arranging appropriate treatment with the family doctors. Undoubtedly contact tracing and treatment of the symptomless carriers paid a large part in limiting the spread of this disease. Once again, as one would expect, it was the large families living in overcrowded conditions that suffered most. Close contact rather than infected food seemed to be the method of spread. The Clean Air Act was given the Royal Assent in July and various sections come into operation on dates to be fixed by the Minister. The Act places very important and heavy burdens on Local Authorities and if the problems of fuel supplies, storage and cost can be overcome—and there is no sign as yet that they will be—the formation of Smoke Controlled Areas must eventually have a cumulative and beneficial effect on the cleanliness of the atmosphere in the Metropolis. However, industry and that must include Power Stations and Gas Works, must also contribute a fair share to cleaner air in our urban communities. Once again old people living alone and in failing health, presented serious problems to the Department. Fortunately the hospital bed situation was satisfactory and no old person in need of hospital care had to wait any time for admission. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, became operative on the Ist January, 1956, together with the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. These Regulations, which are comprehensive, provide requirements regarding the cleanliness of food premises and persons engaged in the handling of food. A summary of the main provisions of the Regulations was prepared in the Department and distributed to all food handlers in the Borough. At the same time the staff continued with systematic inspections to ensure general compliance with the legal requirements. Once again I am glad to have the opportunity of thanking the Staff of the Public Health Department for their diligence and loyalty throughout the year and my thanks are also due to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee for their support and help. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, B.Sc., M.B., ch.B., D.P.H. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0-95 and for deaths 0-95 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 1,050, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 116. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough... 1,564 acres Estimated mid-year home population ... 71,840 1956 1955 Deptford London London Deptford Birth rate (per 1,000 living) 14.86 15.8 14.3 15.0 Still births (ditto) 0.27 0.32 0.32 0.31 Death rate (ditto) 13.2 11.1 11.4 11.7 Infantile mortality rate (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live births) 23.3 25.2 21.2 11.4 1956 1955 Live births registered Legitimate 1,005 1,005 (adjusted for inward and outward transfers) Illegitimate 63 43 Total 1,068 1,048 17 23 Still births registered Legitimate Illegitimate 3 1 20 24 Total 23 11 Infant deaths Legitimate Illegitimate 4 1 27 12 Total 952* 857 Total deaths There were two maternal deaths during 1956 resulting in a maternal mortality rate of 1.8. Of this number 177 occurred in the New Cross General Hospital. The death rate for Deptford if these deaths were excluded would be 10.7 instead of 13.2. Section " B " INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed a decline of 761. This decline is more than accounted for by reason of Measles notifications dropping from 1,036 to 38. Other infectious diseases, which showed a marked decline, were Whooping Cough from 114-79 and Pneumonia from 41 to 33. On the other hand there was an increase in the number of notifications of Dysentery from 9 to 268 and Scarlet Fever from 39 to 61. Typhoid Fever. One case was notified and confirmed. Investigation failed to discover the origin and all known contacts were found negative on examination. Sonne Dysentery. The outbreak of Sonne Dysentery started rather earlier than is normal and the early incidence was probably due, in some measure at least, to the abnormally cold climatic conditions which prevailed in the opening months of the year. Despite close co-operation with local medical practitioners and the schools and school health service officers, notifications continued to be reasonably heavy until the school holidays started in July. After the school holidays only odd isolated cases were found although medical practitioners continued wisely to draw the attention of the Public Health Department to cases of intestinal disturbance in order that bacteriological examination of faeces could be made. During the year, 1972 bacteriological examinations in respect of 1,003 patients were made and tribute must be paid to the staff of the Public Health Laboratory service for their excellent work and co-operation.

Includes all forms of pneumonia. Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Sanitary Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. The deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1956 were 12 males and 3 females as compared with 12 and 2 respectively during the previous year. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 7 of the male deaths and the three female deaths were of persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 28% were within this age group.

Od. New Notifications of Tuberculosis In the past five years new notifications of tuberculosis in Deptford have been something short of 200 a year. The 1956 figure of 118 notifications is relatively high compared with other areas of South Eastern Metropolitan 10 Hospital region. I understand that Greenwich, with a population of 88,780, had 73 new cases last year. Of the 118 cases in Deptford, 51 were infective cases from the start, as compared with 13 out of the 73 in Greenwich. Deptford has a population of 71,840. Brighton, with a population of 157,000, only produced 118 new cases of tuberculosis last year of which only 43 were positive, compared with 51 positive in Deptford. Bromley Chest Clinic, covering a population of 154,110, produced 117 new cases with 43 sputum positive cases. Even Maidstone Clinic, covering a population of 124,660 and a register of 1,169, only produced 71 new cases of which 20 were positive. The tuberculosis register was 1,160 in Deptford at the end of last year. The morbidity from tuberculosis in Deptford is relatively high, there being a large proportion of infective cases and of intermediate or well advanced cases of tuberculosis. Accordingly the death rate from tuberculosis is still fairly high in Deptford. Clinic Register The numbers of notified cases of tuberculosis have increased enormously in the last two years, owing to the more effective case finding resulting from the advent of the major X-ray unit at the Deptford Chest Clinic in 1950. At the beginning of 1949 there were 502 notified cases on the tuberculosis register, but this had grown to 1,160 by the end of 1956, despite the removal of many hundreds of names from the tuberculosis register as having recovered, died, or having removed to other areas of England. Treatment The tuberculosis mortality has been greatly reduced by the use of the modern drugs in treatment, not infrequently combined with major chest surgery and rest treatment. Drug treatment with rest alone may cause the disease to heal sufficiently for the patient to resume a normal existence without further danger of breakdown in health, but where only partial healing is obtained, the remaining diseased area may have to be removed or collapsed by surgical means. In advanced cases, however, the patient may be saved from death by treatment, but still be disabled for a long period of time, if not indefinitely. In fact, though the mortality from the disease shrinks, the morbidity remains a problem and more patients remain "on the books". Tuberculous Families Deptford is an area with many large families and much contact examination is done at the Chest Clinic. In addition these families seem to move in and out of the Borough a good deal. In 1955, Deptford received no less than 33 new tuberculous families and transferred out 101 to other areas. In 1956, 50 families moved in and a further 108 moved out of the area. By comparison, I understand that there were 41 inward transfers and 42 outward transfers in Greenwich in 1956. 11 New Cases referred to the Chest Clinic I have figures to show that Woolwich Chest Clinic, with a population of 152,800, saw and examined 1,558 new cases at the request of general practitioners in 1956. Bromley has a population of 154,110 and saw 1,128 new cases. These were cases referred with chest symptoms, and of course few, relatively, were found to be tuberculous. A large variety of other chest diseases such as cancer of the lung, bronchiectasis or emphysema were discovered. During the same year 1,331 new cases were seen at Deptford. Mass Miniature Radiography I understand that the yield of abnormalities on Mass X-ray in S.E. London boroughs is 50% greater than that of the national average. The Unit has been visiting Deptford and surrounding areas very frequently, almost continuously in the last two years. A considerable number of cases of tuberculosis and of other lung diseases have been found as a result. Carrington House Persons who frequent this Institution, which has 800 to 900 beds, are known to be prone to tuberculosis as a result of the unsatisfactory mode of existence in so many instances. I see a large number of Carrington House men at Deptford Chest Clinic, some of whom are found to have tuberculosis. As a class they present many difficult problems which often involve myself and my staff in a good deal of time and effort, all too frequently without avail. They are hard to follow up in their treatment, tend to move about from place to place, and their habits and uncooperative ways waste a lot of my time. Their self discharge rate from hospitals and sanatoria is high, which means that I may be faced with the same type of problem over and over again with the same man. In 1956, the tuberculosis cases in Carrington House fell into two main groups, consisting of 18 brand new cases diagnosed during 1956 and also 13 known cases of tuberculosis who moved into Carrington House from outside areas. Inward Transfers Of these 13 Inward Transfers, only one man remains in Carrington House, 18 months later, at the time of writing. The average length of stay in the borough of the rest was a little short of four months. Of the 12 "birds of passage", five moved to common lodging houses outside the borough, one having been barred from Carrington House by alcoholism — a not-uncommon blemish. Of the remainder, three disappeared without a trace, two went to hospital or sanatorium, one went to a tuberculosis hostel run by the L.C.C., and one died. Seven of the 13 men were born in England, five came from Ireland and one from Scotland. Of the seven Englishmen, three were Londoners. Eleven had labouring occupations, 12 there was one seaman and one clerk. Nine of these men had served in the armed forces. There were eight bachelors among them, four whose marriages had broken down and one who was a widower. The average age of these men was 49 years. At the end of 1956, no less than eleven out of the thirteen were considered to still have active, uncontrolled infective pulmonary tuberculosis. Newly-Diagnosed Cases The average age of these cases was rather higher, namely 551\2 years, and only half of these have so far been proved to be infective cases. Nine of the cases were diagnosed as a result of being sent to the clinic by their private doctor, six were found by the Mass X-ray and the remaining three attended the clinic or local hospital on their own initiative and were diagnosed. The land of origin in these cases is interesting, the figures being:— Eire 8 England 6 Scotland 2 N. Ireland 1 Wales 1 The length of residence of these cases in Carrington House before diagnosis is also of interest. Eight had resided there for less than six months. Seven had lived there for over a year and four of these were over-five-year residents. The figures of the remaining three are doubttul. Incidentally, sixteen were manual workers (labourers) and there were two pedlars, one being a tarpaulin repairer and the other a scissors grinder. Three of these men had originally come to London from the North of England during the time of the General Strike in 1926. When first seen, seven of them had been out of work for six months, four over twelve months (one for 10 years), four were old age pensioners and three were actually at work." Mass Miniature Radiography The Director of the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit has supplied me with figures on the results of the visits to this Unit to All Saints' Church Hall, Monson Road from 9th August to 27th August, and at Goldsmith's College, Lewisham Way, from 4th December to 6th December 1956. 13 General Analysis Men Women Total 2,058 Total X-rayed 1,020 1,038 Total previously X-rayed 644 667 1,311 Total recalled for large film 40 96 56 Number normal on large film 21 17 38 Number abnormal on large film 22 57 35 Not yet attended for large film 1 1 Analysis of abnormal large films.

The number of complaints received in the Department decreased by 204, and thus the Inspectors were able to deal in greater detail with routine matters and, in particular to pay greater attention to sanitary arrangements in Food Premises. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council (General Powers) Acts and the London County Council Bye-Laws. Offensive Trade Only one factory in the Borough is classed as an Offensive Trade— a Soap Boilers. Complaints regarding effluvia emanating from these premises occur from time to time as the factory is adjacent to a busy shopping centre and a school. In spite of difficulties in situation, complaints are kept to a minimum as the result of co-operation between the management and the Public Health Department. Smoke Abatement and Air Pollution It was not necessary to undertake legal proceedings or any action other than informal during the year. A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department building, and results and details are sent to the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarised the work carried out: — 17 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1956 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (1) Local Authority (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.

Number of "Block" control schemes carried out - 3 - A high proportion of business premises in the Borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— 19 Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 89 Premises disinfected (requests) 250 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 370 Total number of articles disinfected 15,117 Books disinfected 50 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 97 In addition there was a small amount of disinfection undertaken on behalf of the Admiralty in respect of stores of bedding at the Royal Victoria Yard, Grove Street, Deptford, and £30 5s. 6d. was received from the Admiralty in respect of this service. Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 884 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo ... 45 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 133 Scabies baths for adults 4 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 295 new premises. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits, etc., are carried out by the District Public Health Inspectors. 20 Inspections Number on Register Number of Inspections Notices Written Occupiers Prosecuted 7 (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3,4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 50 28 - (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 329 121 - - Defects Found Sanitary Conveniences: Found Remedied Referred To H.M.

Whitening manufacturers. Laundries, cleaners. Offensive trades. Marine stores. Miscellaneous. Paint and varnish works. The number of inspections made to home workers premises was 58. The types of works carried on by the 163 outworkers in this Borough were as follows:— Wearing apparel (115), artificial flowers (2), paper bags (3), boxes (5), button cards (6), shuttlecocks (2), paper hats (4), electrical components (2), druggists' sundries (1). toys (2), cardoard tubes (11), lampshades (6), leather goods (2), jewellery (1), and wire embroidery (1). Section " D " FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 22 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises. Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to County Hall. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables, V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. 178 Evelyn Street Details will be found in Appendix VI. Ice-Cream Forty-four samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 16 Grade II 12 Grade III 6 Grade IV 10 44 Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable, Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. Two infringements were dealt with informally. School Milks Fourteen samples were sent for chemical examination and fifteen were sent for bacteriological examination. Milk (Special Designations) Act Fifty-eight samples were submitted.

These samples were also examined, where appropriate, under the various Orders concerning Food Standards and Food Labelling made under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, and continued in operation by virtue of Section 136 and the Twelfth Schedule of the new Act. Prepacked drugs were also examined under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. The Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., has submitted the following report on milk sampling:— "I have pleasure in furnishing the following particulars concerning the composition of the milk samples submitted for analysis during the year 1956. "Thirty-eight samples of milk were submitted during the year, all of which were taken informally. None were found to be " adulterated ", and none of the samples fell below the minimum legal standard in respect of either fat or solids-not-fat. "The average composition of the samples analysed is shown in the following Table, with the averages of previous years for comparison. AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, DEPTFORD Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1947 3.51 8.68 12.19 1948 3.45 8.72 12.17 1949 3.47 8.74 12.21 1950 3.44 8.70 12.14 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 1952 3.48 8.69 12.17 1953 3.44 8.69 12.13 1954 3.45 8.72 12.17 1955 3.50 8.64 12.14 1956 3.64 8.70 12.34 Having regard to the small number of milk samples analysed during the year and the seasons during which they were submitted it is not felt that any conclusion as to a quality trend would be justified from the apparent increase in fat shown in the Table. 25 Since 1944 it has been customary for me to supply for the purposes of your Annual Report an additional Table showing particulars of samples examined under the Labelling of Food Orders and the various Food Standards Orders made under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943. In January, 1956, however, these Orders were brought under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and contraventions of the Orders are now treated as offences against the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Examinations of all foods to which such Orders apply for compliance with their specific requirements are now therefore included in the "Food and Drugs Act" analyses, and since particulars of the results have been included in the Quarterly Reports under that Act the submission of any additional Table would be redundant." Section "E " HOUSING 28 HOUSING At the end of 1956 the Council had a total of 950 permanent houses, maisonettes and flats, a total of 344 temporary houses of various types and controlled a further 739 properties under requisition. The requisitioned properties housed 1,018 units of tenancy. During the year, 110 flats and 10 maisonettes were completed for the Council and 55 flats were in the course of construction. Also, 3,030 improvements were carried out in 1,079 houses, somewhat less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 202. Apart from the flats, etc., completed by the Council 133 flats were completed by the London County Council, and 10 houses, 14 maisonettes and 12 flats were completed by private owners. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1956:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 2,369 Number of Statutory Notices served 403 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 1,079 Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 47 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during the year 11 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation during the year 24 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Housing Repairs and Rents Act and Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Twenty-four applications for Certificates of Disrepair were made during the year. Nineteen were granted and the remainder were either refused or the application withdrawn. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 30 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES (London County Council) The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer (Dr. F. R. Waldron) are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.B, and the services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics are as follows:— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E. 14. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, and Ante-Natal Clinics. Vaccination and immunisation. Foot Clinic. Mothercraft Class. Day Nursery. Artificial Sunlight, Simple Massage and Exercises Clinic. St. George's Hall, Shardeloes Road, S.E.4. Infant Welfare and Ante-natal Clinics. St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8.

These items are also available at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the Women's Voluntary Services, 302 New Cross Road, S.E.14. Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 32 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are normally sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1956 was 510, of which 204 were received from Greenwich and 233 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 Is. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to 33 arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Nine persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1956. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five Darby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the District. In addition, the Albany Institute Old Peoples' Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. There is no provision, as yet, in Deptford for a laundry service, but I give details regarding our " Meals on Wheels " service which is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. Meals are provided to about 130 old people each week. The meals are obtained from the United Girls Schools for Social Services at a cost of Is. 8d. per meal, for which the individuals pay 1Od. and the London County Council pay a subsidy of 1Od. per meal. The Council pay the United Girls Schools monthly for the cost of the meals. 5,931 meals were provided during the year. The Deptford Borough Council provide a vehicle (which was presented by a local firm) and a driver, to deliver about 40 meals twice a week to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to " Darby and Joan " Clubs. The W.V.S. provide the helpers for delivery of meals. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" clorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. 34 Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at IIderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Eight applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 45 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Seventy two examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for Promotion of Health—Blackpool. The Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor Mrs. F. K. Dolby) and the Medical Officer of Health. National Smoke Abatement Society—Southport. Councillor Mrs. A. M. Ott and Mr. A. C. Webster, Public Health Inspector. Sanitary Inspectors' Association—Bournemouth. Mr. W. F. Mayo, Chief Public Health Inspector.
