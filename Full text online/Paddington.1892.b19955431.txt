THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON, in the County of London, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens ; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone ; and on the West by Kensington and the detached portion of St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. II. Parliamentary Electoral Divisions. In 1885 Paddington was constituted a separate Parliamentary Borough by the Redistribution of Seats Act (48 and 49 Victoria, cap. 23). The Borough returns Two Members to Parliament, and for the Purposes of election it is divided into Two Divisions, b 10 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. under the names of North Paddington and South Paddington. North Paddington consists of Ward No. 2, and South Paddington of Wards Nos. 1, 3, and 4. The number of Borough Voters, according to the Register made in 1892, is as follows:— North Paddington 6,995 South Paddington 5,239 Total 12,234 The number of Parliamentary County Voters in Paddington is 252. The following particulars give the results of the Parliamentary Elections which have taken place in the Borough, viz.:— North Paddington. 1885, November.—Lionel L. Cohen, M.P. 1886, June.— do. (deceased). 1887, July.—John Aird, M.P. 1892, July.— do. South Paddington. 1885, November.—Right Hon. Lord Randolph Churchill, M.P. 1886, June.— do. do. 1892, July.— do. do. III. Registration Districts. The Registrar-General has divided Paddington into two Districts for the Registration of Births and Deaths, called respectively the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line, REPORT, 1892-93. 11 Registrars of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. Superintendent Registrar—Henry F. Aveling. Register Office, 287, Harrow Road. Registrar of Marriages—William Kirk, 78, Westbourne Park Road. Registrars of Births and Deaths—St. Mary's District, William Kirk, 78, Westbourne Park Road. St. John's District, Matthew Batten Cranstone, 35, Spring Street, Sussex Gardens. IV. Poor-Law Administration. The Paddington Workhouse and Infirmary are situate in the Harrow Road ; the management is in the hands of a Board of Guardians, Eighteen of whom are Elected Guardians (elected by the Ratepayers). The resident Justices of the Peace are ex-officio Members of the Board. Paddington is united with St. George, Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District, the Schools being at Ashford, near Staines. For list of Guardians see Appendix No. V. V. The School Board. In 1870, Paddington and the parishes of St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were formed into one of the Metropolitan Districts for the purposes of the Elementary Education Act (33 and 34 Victoria, cap. 75), under the name of the Marylebone Division of the School Board for London, which Division returns Seven Members to the School Board. For Managers of the Board Schools of the Marylebone Division see Appendix No. VI. B 2 12 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. VI. Ecclesiastical Districts. Paddington is divided into Seventeen Ecclesiastical Districts, Viz.:— St. James', „ John's, „ Mary's, Holy Trinity, St. Paul's, All Saints', St. Matthew's, „ Luke's, Westbourne Park, „ Saviour's, „ Michael and All Angels, Christ Church, St. Mary Magdalene, „ Peter's, „ Stephen's, „ Augustine's, Emmanuel, St. Luke's, Kilburn. VII. The County Council. By the Local Government Act of 1888, the Metropolitan Board of Works was superseded by the London County Council, and the area which had hitherto been under the control of the Metropolitan Board, was formed into the Administrative County of London, each Parliamentary Electoral Division returning double the number of Members to the Council to that returned to Parliament, so that Paddington has Four Members on the Council. The number of County Council voters, according to the Register made in 1892, is as follows:— North Paddington 6,736 South Paddington 5,941 12,677 The following particulars give the results of the County Council Elections which have taken place in the Borough, viz.:— North Paddington. Elected Ylth Jan., 1889. R. Melvill Beachcroft. E. Parker Young. March, 1892. H. P. Harris. W. Urquhart. South Paddington. Elected Ylth Jan., 1889. T. G. Fardell, J.P. Sir George D. Harris. March, 1892. T. G. Fardicll, J. P. Sir George D. Harris. REPORT, 1892-93. 13 VIII. Gas and Water Supply. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gat Light and Coke Company. The Water is supplied by two Companies, viz.the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. Ratepayers residing on the Bishop of London's Estate are entitled to a deduction of 15 per cent. A plan of the Estate may be seen at the Vestry Hall. IX. Municipal Electoral Divisions. Paddington is divided into Four Wards, as follow, viz.:— WARD No. 1:—All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the N.W. boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. WARD No. 2:-All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite the West end of the centre of Craven Road, thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. 14 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. WARD No. 3:—All that portion of the said Pariah which lies South of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD No. 4:—All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. For the purposes of Rate Collection, Ward No. 2 has been sub-divided as follows:— Division No. 2a East:—All that portion of the Ward lying North of the canal and South of a line drawn through the centre of Sutherland Avenue from Harrow Road to Shirland Road, and East of a line drawn along the centre of Shirland Road from Sutherland Avenue to Kilburn Park Road. Division No. 2a West:—All that portion of the Ward lying North of a line drawn along the centre of Sutherland Avenue from Harrow Road to Shirland Road, and West of a line drawn along the centre of Shirland Road from Sutherland Avenue to Kilburn Park Road. Division No. 2b:—All that portion of the Ward lying South of the line of the Grand Junction and Regents Canals from Maida Vale to Lock Bridge, Harrow Road. X. Population. The population of Paddington, at the Census taken in 1891 (revised) was as follows, viz.:— North Paddington 64,668 South Paddington 53,178 Total 117,846 REPORT, 1892-93. 15 XI. The Vestry. In 1855 the Vestry of Paddington was reconstituted as the Local Authority of the Parish by the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 120). The Vestry is the Board of Works for Paddington, and consists of Seventy-two Elected Members and the Vicar of Paddington, who is ex-officio Chairman of the Vestry. The ordinary meetings of the Vestry are held at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, Paddington Green, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month, the third Tuesday in August and the first Tuesday in September excepted. In 1852 the Vestry resolved to erect a new building for the Municipal purposes of the Parish, and in 1853 the Vestry Hall in the Harrow Road was opened. XII. The Burial Board. In 1854 the Paddington Cemetery, which is situated in the parish of Willesden, was purchased by the Parish. It is managed by a Burial Board, consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry. The ordinary meetings of the Burial Board are held at the Vestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Report of the Burial Board see page 123. XIII. The Baths and Wash-houses. In 1871 Paddington adopted the Baths and Wash-houses Act (9 and 10 Victoria, cap. 74), and the Baths and Wash-houses erected in the Queen's Road, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145 were opened to the public in 1874. The Baths and Wash-houses are under the management of Seven Commissioners appointed by the Vestry. For Report of the Commissioners of Baths and Wash-houses see page 129. 16 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XIV. The Parochial Charities. There are certain charities under the control of the Vestry, managed by Trustees appointed by the Vestry and the Charity Commissioners. These Charities have an annual income of over Two Thousand Pounds, which is yearly distributed to the Poor in Coals and Blankets, in Grants to the Parochial National Schools in apprenticing sons and daughters of poor parishioners, and in Annuities to aged persons resident in the Parish, &c. For the Schedule of the Charities, with names of Trustees &c., see page 146. For the Accounts of the Charities see page 153. XV. Members of the Vestry.

XXI.—Conferences. Delegates have been appointed to attend Conferences convened by various Vestries and DistrictBoards in the Metropolis upon the following subjects :— Cab Radius, Canals, Burial Fees, Wages to Workmen. 22 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXII.—Coroner's Court and Mortuary. The question of the inadequate accommodation for holding inquests in Paddington formed the subject of a communication from the London County Council, and was referred to a Joint Committee of the Works and Sanitary Committees, who have expressed an opinion which has been adopted by the Vestry that the existing Mortuary meets the present requirements of the Parish, and that it is most undesirable that the Yestry should take steps for providing a Coroner's Court, such duty devolving upon the London County Council. The Committee advised that such accommodation, when secured, should be as near as possible to the existing Mortuary, or St. Mary's Hospital. XXIII.—Assessment Appeals. The appeal of the National Telephone Company has been settled by a reduction of £50 on the rateable value. The Appeal of the Metropolitan Railway Company was settled in favour of the Yestry, with costs. XXIV.—Canals. At the instigation of the Vestry of Marylebone, a Conference of Delegates from the Parishes of Marylebone, St. Pancras, and Paddington was 23 REPORT, 1892-93. convened, in order that steps might be taken for keeping the Regent's and Grand Junction Canals in a proper sanitary condition. The waterway extending from Maiden Lane Bridge, in St. Paneras, to Kensal Road, in Paddington, was traversed by means of a Steam Launch, and a close inspection made of the various basins, together with the locks and drains in connection therewith. At certain points samples of the Canal water were taken. The report prepared and issued to the members of the authorities represented, concluded with the following recommendations:— Recommendations. (1) We are of opinion that the three Vestries of St. Marylebone, St. Paneras, and Paddington should each in their respective districts take proper measures to prevent objectionable solid or liquid substances from fouling the Canal, and to prohibit the discharge into the Canal of all drains and drainage other than unpolluted surface water. There seems to be ample powers for this action, and the 120th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, also provides against nuisances, wholly or partially caused by the acts or defaults of two or more persons, even should the act or default of any one of such persons not in itself be a nuisance. (2) With regard to the Zoological Gardens, seeing that, at present, there is no public Sewer BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. available for the Gardens to be drained into, that a Sewer be constructed, provided that the Crown and the Zoological Society join with the Vestries of St. Paneras and St. Marylebone in the expense, and that the Society be required to connect all their drains with the said Sewer. (3) The Vestries within whose jurisdiction there are wharves and basins, should request the London County Council to make By-laws pursuant to Section 16 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in relation to offensive cargoes. (4) The Canal Companies should be required by the Vestry to systematically scavenge the surface of the Canals, and the banks thereof on alternate days in each week throughout the year. (5) The Canal Companies should be required to scavenge the bottom of the whole of the Canals, including the Basins and Lay-byes, annually, removing the whole of the mud and other deposits, by dredging or other effective means. (6) That parts of the Canals, such as basins, laybyes, and places adjacent to wharves, where mud and other deposits are likely to accumulate, should be concreted. (7) That in addition to the existing overflows at Paddington Basin, an overflow should be constructed at the Southern end of the Cumberland Market Basin, so as to change the water, instead of its being 24 25 report, 1892-93. allowed to stagnate as at present, and when water is abundant the existing sluice valve should be opened far more often than hitherto.

These recommendations were adopted by Paddington, and the necessary notices served. The matter has since been taken up by the London County Council who have instructed Dr. Young, one of their assistant medical officers, to make a thorough inspection of the Canals. c 26 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXV. Empty Houses. The half-rating of empty houses (at the instigation of Mr. Townsend) has from time to time, exercised the minds of the Yestry, but upon the question being reconsidered by the Finance Committee, a Resolution was passed (Nov. 15th, 1892) that it was not advisable to rate empty houses in accordance with the provisions of section 123 of the Paddington Local Act. XXVI. Factory & Workshop Acts, 1878-1891. Upon the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee it was Resolved:– “That the Yestry do cause Notices, in accordance with the request of the Local Grovernment Board, to be served upon the occupier of every factory and workshop in the Parish (including any workshop conducted on the system of not employing any child, young person, or woman therein), and every contractor employed by any such occupier in any of the businesses mentioned in the schedule hereunder, to keep in the form and with the particulars prescribed by the Home Secretary, lists showing the names of all persons directly employed by him or them, either as workman or as contractor, in the said business outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are employed, in order that such list may be 27 REPORT, 1892-93. inspected by any Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878‚ or by any Officer of a Sanitary Authority.” Manufacturers of Articles of Wearing Apparel. Do. of Electro Plate. Do. of Files. Cabinet and Furniture Making, and Upholstery Work. XXVII. Gates & Bars. In January, 1892, a communication was addressed to the London County Council requesting them to include the following Grates and Bars in their proposed Bill for the abolition of street obstructions in the Metropolis :— Kensington Gardens Square and Princes Square. Norfolk Square by Cambridge Place. Sussex Square. Devonport Street by Sussex Place. And in June, 1892, the following additions were made to the list: — Hyde Park Gardens by Sussex Square. Craven Hill Gardens by Leinster Terrace. Kensington Palace Gardens. The slight opposition raised to the action of the Vestry in this matter seems likely to be disarmed by the paving of some ot the thoroughfares with wood, the cost thereof to be divided between the London County Council and the Parish. c2 28 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXVIII. Immigration of Pauper Aliens. The necessity of steps being taken by Her Majesty's Government to stop the “ Immigration of Pauper Aliens " in order to minimise the possibility of the importation of Cholera has been recognised by several Yestries in the Metropolis, and representations have been made to that effect. The following resolution was passed by the Yestry :— “That this Yestry is of opinion that the free immigration of destitute aliens constitutes a source of danger as regards Cholera infection, and considers the present is an opportune moment to urge upon the Government the necessity of taking steps to stop the entry of such aliens into this country." XXIX. Public Lavatory Accommodation. The New Public Lavatory in the Harrow Road at the Junction of Walterton Road and Elgin Avenue, was opened by the Chairman of the Works Committee on 13th October, 1892. This Lavatory provides accommodation for both men and women, as under :— Men 14 Urinals ; 5 W.C's. Women—4 W.C's. 3 Wash basins for men; 2 for women. 29 REPORT, 1892-93. For cost of working Lavatories, see Surveyor's Report pages (75 and 76). For several years the question of the necessity of providing Lavatory Accommodation near the Lock Bridge, has been discussed, but in spite of the Yestry's efforts in the matter, nothing was done until this year. Negotiations were entered into for the purchase of a freehold house at the North-west end of Clarendon Street, but the price asked for the property was so exorbitant that the Yestry decided to adopt a suggestion of the Surveyor, viz.:—To construct an Underground Lavatory in the centre of the roadway of such Street. The Tender of Mr. Neave was accepted for the work, and it is expected that the Lavatory will be opened in July. Of all modern improvements undertaken by Local Authorities, there are none which can be said to have contributed more largely to the health and comfort of pedestrians than the construction of Lavatory Accommodation for both sexes, such as is now being carried out in the Metropolis. The opposition which a few years ago was sufficient to crush any effort of the kind, has now entirely broken down, owing no doubt to the fact that the conveniences in question are placed underground. 30 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXX. Parliamentary Bills. The following measures have received the consideration of the Yestry :— Clapham Junction and Paddington Railway, Edgware Road and Yictoria Railway, Harrow Road and Paddington Tramways, London Building Law Consolidation, London County Council —General Powers, London Streets (Removal of Gates and Bars), Paddington Recreation Ground, Telephone Companies. Paddington Recreation Ground. A detailed account of the acquisition of this ground will be found upon reference to the reports of the Committee on pages 219, 232, 254 of the Yestry minutes of 1892, and page 41 of the Yestry Minutes of 1893. The report, however, may be summarised as follows:— The Yestry agreed in December, 1890, to cooperate with the Paddington Recreation Ground Committee for the purpose of securing to the Public for ever the ground known as the “ Paddington Recreation Ground," consisting of nearly twenty-one acres, and to contribute, under the Metropolitan Open Spaces Act, a sum not exceeding £25,000 towards acquiring the land so soon as the remaining 31 REPORT, 1892-93. half had been subscribed by the general public. Owing to the indefatigable exertions of Mr. Alderman Beachcroft, L.C.C., Mr. T. G. Fardell, J.P., L.C.C., and others, there is every prospect of the land referred to being obtained for the purpose of healthful recreation. XXXI. Praed Street Passage Way, In connection with the proposed extension of St. Mary's Hospital, permission has been given for closing the passage-way known as “ St. Mary's Passage," in Cambridge Place, on condition that a passage was formed connecting Francis Street with Praed Street. This work has not only been the means of affording increased accommodation to the Hospital authorities, but has provided a better means of ingress to Francis Street. XXXII.

In March, 1892, the Board of Management of St. Mary's Hospital, Cambridge Place, made application to have the Passageway known as "St. Mary's Passage "which separated their Hospital from some newly acquired property in Praed Street, closed up, in order that they might carry out their extension scheme, and in lieu of the said Passageway they offered to give up at the western end of their property, and at right angles to Praed Street, a space sufficient for the construction of a Passageway 15-ft. 6-in. wide, connecting Praed Street with Arthur Mews, and making a more direct communication with Stanley Street and Francis Street. The Hospital authorities destroyed the houses and formed the Passageway, the Vestry at their own expense paving the same, the cost being £59 4s. 2d. 68 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON.

In that portion of Westbourne Terrace sewer extending from James Street northward to the head wall, a length of 320-ft. the invert was so defective and the gradient flat that the sewage could not flow freely away, but accumulated and became offensive. In order to improve the gradient it was necessary to construct about 100-ft. of new brick sewer, with step junction from the Bishop's Road sewer, and underpin and form new invert and reverse the gradient of old brick sewer from south to north, and connect it with the new sewer. At the same time many old disused drain mouths were bricked up and other incidental works carried out in connection with the foregoing improvements, at a total cost to the Vestry of £629 1s. 8d. REPORT, 1892-93. 69 Seventy-eight feet run of 3-ft. by 2-ft. half-brick sewer, with manhole entrance thereto, has been constructed at the south end of Lancaster Yard, late Brook Mews, in consequence of the very bad condition of the brick sewer there. The portion of the old sewer extending from Lancaster Street to the new sewer has been underpinned and greatly improved in accordance with the scheme of special sewers repairs. The cost of new sewer was £53 13s. lOd. Mr. Boatfield, Builder, having given notice to the Vestry on the 21st June for the erection and drainage of six houses on the south side of Canterbury Road, the Vestry made an order that the houses be drained into a sewer to be constructed by the Vestry from the head wall of the existing 3-ft. 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in. sewer to the western boundary of the Parish; Mr. Boatfield to pay a moiety of the cost of constructing such sewer in respect to the frontage of the before-mentioned houses, under section 52 of the 25th and 26th Vic., cap. 102. Messrs. Seaman, Builders, also gave notice for the erection and drainage of sixteen houses on the same side of roadway, and an order for draining was made similar to that on Mr. Boatfield. A brick sewer on the north side of Canterbury Road being under the control of the Willesden Local Authorities, they objected to the before-mentioned houses draining into same, consequently the Vestry 70 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. gave instructions to prepare Plans and Specifications for the construction of a brick sewer on the south side of roadway, subject to the approval of the London County Council. This was done, and the approval of the Council obtained. The sewer, 500-ft. in length, together with side entrance, air openings and manhole, has been constructed by the Vestry's contractor at a cost of £447. On the 20th December the Vestry apportioned and charged the moiety of cost of sewer, £223 10s., upon the respective owners of the twenty-two houses in accordance with the before-mentioned section of the Act, and the frontage charges have been paid to the Accountant of my Department on behalf of the Vestry. One hundred and forty-four feet of 3-ft. 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in. one-brick sewer has been constructed by Mr. W. Seaman, in Bravington Road, from that portion constructed by him in July of last year, and extending to near Canterbury Road. This completes the whole of the sewer in this roadway. The total length of sewers under the jurisdiction of the Vestry is 54 miles, 7 furlongs, and 175 yards. New brick manhole entrances have been constructed to the sewers in Chichester Mews, Conduit Mews, and Formosa Street, in order to allow the Vestry's flushers more ready means of access to them for cleansing purposes. REPORT, 1892-93. 71 The side entrance to sewer in Lanhill Road has been reconstructed so as to allow a new carriageway entrance to be formed to Messrs. Welford's Dairy Premises. The expense of so doing, £25 9s. 8d., has been defrayed by Messrs. Welford. In consequence of frequent complaints to the Vestry by occupiers of stables and others interested in the property in Upper Brook Mews, as to the insanitary condition of the brick sewer there, the Vestry instructed me to fix an Automatic flushing tank at the North end of such sewer, to discharge twice daily for the purpose of flushing and cleansing the same. This work has been carried out, and is now effectually keeping the sewer in a cleanly condition. Special Repairs to Old Servers.

These works have been carried out for and at the expense of the Vestry amounting to £1,537 8s. 7d. One hundred and thirty-seven new pipe drains have also been constructed under the public roadways and footways to old buildings, and block flap-traps fixed at the outlets of the drains into sewers for private persons, and the sum of £1.043 5s. 8d. has been received by the Vestry from them on account of these works, the total amount paid to Messrs. Neave and Son under their contract being £2,580 4s. 3d. The sum of £20 8s. Od. has been received by the Accountant of my Department from various private persons for the examinations of house drains from the sewers by the Vestry's flushers, with respect to obstructions or other causes, the parties requiring the information receiving a report of the condition of drains in question, the number of these examinations being one hundred and two. The usual flushing and cleansing of the brick and pipe sewers and sand-pits of gulleys, has been carried out during the year, which has had the effect of keeping the inverts of sewers free for the flow of sewage, and the sand-pits in working condition.

A charge of one penny is made for the use of each closet and lavatory, the urinals being free. In the portion allotted to women, there is an attendant's room, four closets, and a lavatory, with two tip-basins, one closet being free, and for the use of the remaining closets or lavatory a charge of one penny is made. Since its opening it has conferred an immense boon upon pedestrians of both sexes, the women especially express their appreciation to the attendants of the accommodation provided.

Continuous complaints having been made for years as to the want of urinal accommodation near this locality, and several schemes have been proposed to meet the difficulty, but in every case the objections raised by the surrounding inhabitants were so great, that any attempt to construct a urinal above ground had to be abandoned. During the early part of the year the nuisance became so serious, and complaints being addressed to the London County Council, the Works Committee took the matter in hand and tried all they could to negotiate with the owner for the sale of one of the unfinished buildings on the N.E. side of Clarendon Street, which were built upwards of twenty years since, but he asked such an exorbitant price that, when the matter came before the Yestry on 2nd August, 1892, they determined to adopt the alternative scheme proposed, that was to construct an underground lavatory. Plans and specifications were prepared, and tenders received, for carrying out this work. The construction was commenced on the 20th of February, and is now progressing, and will, in all probability, be ready for the public by the end of July next, the accommodation being for men only, viz., three closets and ten urinals, with lavatory and attendant s room.

A new wing building has been added to the Harrow Road Board Schools, near western boundary of 78 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. the parish, and the same to the Amberley Road Board Schools; the whole of the drainage being rearranged in accordance with plans submitted and approved by the Vestry. A portion of the premises belonging to the late Mr. G. Gutch, adjoining Porteus House, Porteus Road, has been acquired and appropriated for the erection of a new drill hall and exercise ground for the 3rd Middlesex Volunteer Artillery. A new mission hall in connection with Emmanuel Church, Harrow Road, has been erected adjoining the church for the Reverend Mr. Farraker. An addition to the Jewish Schools on the south side of Harrow Road, west of Bridge House, has been carried out, and the new building drained into an existing Inspection chamber on the premises. One hundred and one houses have been erected in addition to the before-mentioned buildings. Notices with plans have been submitted to the Vestry for the drainage of these houses, which were inspected in the usual manner before the trenches were filled in. Applications have been made by private persons to the London County Council and the Vestry for permission to erect additions of various kinds to existing buildings, &c., which had reference to the general line of frontage as follows:— 79 REPORT, 1892-93.

The number of public lamp columns and bracket lamps in lighting on the 25th March last was 1,979. They each consume 4.6 cubic feet per hour. The number of refuges and corner lamps, and candle-power, will be found on pages 116, 117. 81 REPORT, 1891-92. The Gas Company have been served with 278 notices during the year for the rectification of defective service pipes, &c. During the year 4 lamp-posts were knocked down, 16 columns broken, and 25 head-irons and lanterns damaged by various parties, the restoration being made good by the Vestry's own staff of workmen, at the expense of those causing the damage, with the exception of 10 who escaped detection. Complaints having been made in the early part of last year as to the insufficient lighting of Uxbridge Road, it was decided by the Vestry, the Committee having one night previously viewed six experimental lamps, to substitute Sugg's Victoria Lamps and 10-ft. governors for the existing 4.6 lamps and burners. This was done by the Vestry's workmen, the posts being moved within the line of kerb and new services put in by the Gas Company, at the cost of the Vestry. The lamps, fifty in number, were first lighted on the 11th June, and are on the average meter system, there being six meters fixed equidistant throughout the road. DUSTING. The question of how to dispose of the enormous quantity of rough dust now annually collected m the Parish is becoming a most difficult one; every outlook 82 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. seems to be getting from bad to worse. As to the possibility of gaining any pecuniary profit from ashes and breeze in future, I think this must be abandoned, and the difficulty and cost of disposal will inevitably be increased year by year. Looking back for the past twelve years it is now apparent that the only plan to overcome the difficulty is by the use of destructors, their adoption in many parts of the Kingdom, and within the Metropolitan area, goes to prove that sooner or later this system of disposal must become almost universal. In the collection of the rough dust during the year the men were employed 309 days, 5,429 horses and vans being engaged in the work; 25,666 loads were collected, giving a daily average of 83.06 loads, or 4.91 loads per horse per day, the maximum loads collected in one week being 736, and the minimum 357; the cost of collecting being £1,936 2s. 7d., and of sifting £1,729 17s. 8d. From the before-mentioned loads of dust the following miscellaneous materials were abstracted, viz.:— 16,490 chaldrons of ashes and 9,389 chaldrons of breeze, 240 boat loads or 4,798 tons of soft core, 248 cart loads and 17 boat loads, or about 800 tons of old broken crockery and pickings, 22 tons of coals, 61 tons 13 cwt. of bones, 100 tons of rags, 55 tons 6 cwt. of old cast and wrought iron, 4 tons 6 cwt. of various metals, REPORT, 1S92-93. 83 such as brass, zinc and pewter, 10£ tons white sheet glass, and 24 tons of black glass. The expenses attending the haulage of the following materials on the Canal were for ashes and breeze, £56 5s.; soft core, £239 18s. 3d.; unloading ashesj &c., at Alperton, £56 5s.; soft core at Southall, £349 17s. 4d.; the tonnage dues on ashes, £69 18s. Id.; and soft core, £239 18s. 3d. SLOPPING. The sweepings, slop, and snow collected from the various thoroughfares are brought to the wharves, the dry sweepings and scrapings being tipped direct into boats alongside the wharf and slop tank, while the slop is deposited in the filtering tanks, so that a large percentage of water may drain away prior to its being loaded into boats, and conveyed away by canal beyond Southall, under a contract with Messrs. Studds, at 2s. 6½d. per ton. This Sum includes haulage, tonnage, unloading, and providing a shoot. The number of days the men were working during the year was 309, 7,823 horses, vans, and carts being employed; 24,133 loads were collected, giving an average of 78.1 loads per working day, or 3.08 loads 84 84 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. per horse per day. The maximum number of loads brought in in one week was 910, and the minimum 212. The expenses paid—collecting, £2,171 13s. 9d.; loading boats, £371 7s. l½d.; unloading boats at Southall, £1,932 3s. 2d.; haulage, £848 17s. Od.; tonnage dues, £939 15s. l1d. Number of boats sent away, 822, equalling 29,103 tons. Road Watering. During the season the water vans were out 135 days; 4,537 horses were employed, giving an average of 33.6 horses and vans per day; the quantity of water used, during the season for road watering and road making purposes being as follows:— Grand Junction Water Company, 23,408,000, gals. at 6½d per 1,000 gals. £633 19 4 West Middlesex Water Company, 6,022,850 gals, at 7½d. per 1,000 gals. £213 6 2 Less 7½ per cent rebate 16 0 0 197 6 2 £831 5 6 On the mains of the Grand Junction Water Company there are 44 standposts, and 13 on the West Middlesex Water Company, total 57, each post being fitted with a meter, the indices of which are read fortnightly during the watering season, from 1st March to 30th November. 85 REPORT, 1892-93. Carting Road Materials. During the year 3,530 horses and carts were engaged on this class of work for 291 days, giving an average of 12.13 per day. Cleansing the Public Streets. The streets are swept, as described in previous reports, by gangs of sweepers, who are assisted by horse scraping and sweeping machines, the woodpaved roads receiving considerable attention, both as regards cleansing and watering, which is done daily. Main and important thoroughfares are swept daily, and those streets where the traffic is not so great are swept two or three times weekly. Sanding Frosty Roads. During frosty weather, and at other times when required, men, horses, carts and sanding machines are sent out during the day, late at night, and early in the morning, distributing shingle over the surface of the roads. On 41 occasions the men and horses were sent out, and during the whole period 311 horses and carts were employed; 901½ cubic yards of materials were used. The 40 sand-bins, stationed beside lamps in certain localities, which took the place of lay-byes for shingle, were of great assistance in speedily furnishing material for this work, and at the same time preventing it being scattered over the footway paving. 86 BOROUGH OF PADD1NGTON.

This Recreation Ground has been attended to by the Gardeners during the year. The old corrugated Watchmen's house has been replaced by an ornamental one of modern construction. St. Marys Churchyard, Northern Portion. By agreement made on the 26th April, 1892, between the Revd. Walter Abbott, Vicar, of the Vicarage and Parish Church of Paddington, and the Vestry of Paddington, it was agreed:— REPORT, 1892-93. 89 1. — The Vestry hereby undertake the entire care, management and control of the said churchyard. 2.—The Vestry will defray the charges for maintaining and keeping up the said churchyard, and will appoint and pay a fit and proper person or persons to maintain order. 3.—The Vestry may hold and administer the powers of management and control acquired by them under this Agreement in manner and subject to the conditions prescribed in the said Act, and also subject to the terms of this Agreement. 4.—The said churchyard shall be and remain open daily to the public during the following hours (that is to say), from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the month of August; from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. during the months of June and July; from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the months of March, April, May, and September; and from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. during the months of October, November, December, January and February. 5.—The Vestry shall refer the consideration of all questions respecting the management of the said churchyard to a Committee of not more than seven in number, of which Committee the Vicar and the Church wardens 90 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. of Paddington shall be ex-officio members, but every resolution of such Committee in relation to such questions shall be subject to confirmation by the Vestry, and shall have no force until so confirmed. A Committee of Management was appointed for St. Mary's Churchyard, Northern Portion, consisting of Seven Members, agreeing to meet on 2nd Monday in November, 3rd Monday in April, and 2nd Monday in July, at 10.15 a.m.; and a Board of Control for St. Mary's Churchyard, Southern Portion, consisting of Six Members, was appointed, agreeing to meet on the before-mentioned dates, at 10 a.m. Fire Hydrants. The London County Council has ordered the Grand Junction Water Works Co., to fix Fire Hydrants in this Parish in connection with their mains. Up to 25th March 167 were fixed and supplied with water. There are 291 more to be fixed, making a total of 458. In addition to these there are some fixed belonging to private individuals. Overhead Wires Act. This Act was passed in July, 1891, to provide for the control and regulation of Overhead Wires in the administrative County of London. It was left with the London County Council to draw up By-laws and submit the same to the Board of Trade for approval. REPORT, 1892-93. 91 This was done in July, 1892, and the various Companies were granted six months to furnish plans and records of existing wires from that date, and one month with respect to all new wires; but owing to the difficulty in obtaining exact plans and records of the numerous wires running in all directions over the Parish and London generally, the London County Council extended the time until the end of the year 1893, at which date they consider the various Companies will have had ample time to comply with the requirements of the said By-laws. Electric Lighting. The Metropolitan Electric Supply Company Limited, have now their station at Amberley Road in full working order, and up to Lady-day there were about 258 customers in the Parish supplied with the electric current. Workmen's Wages. Considerable time and attention has been given during the year by the Works Committee to the repeated applications from Secretaries belonging to "Trades' Unions," and from some of the Vestry's employes, for increased wages. The Committee fully reported on this subject in September last, and in order that such report may be in the hands of each member for ready reference at any time, I have included a copy of the same with my Annual Report. G 2 92 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. PADDINGTON. 29th September, 1892. Report of the Works Committee upon the several communications received with reference to the rate of wages paid to men in the employment of the Vestry. 1.—Your Committee have given very careful attention to the Vestry reference, and in order to deal fairly and fully with the subject they have obtained pay and labour returns from other parishes, a summary whereof has already been forwarded to the Members of the Vestry. 2.—Your Committee would observe that in arriving at their decisions they have not been influenced by the Resolutions (some of a dictatorial character) passed at meetings of workmen and trade unionists. ROAD SWEEPERS. 3.—The position of the Road Sweepers is, in the opinion of your Committee, first deserving of attention, inasmuch as this class of labour is performed by men of all ages and conditions, several of whom in years gone by have served their country and in some cases contributed to the rates of the Parish. The desirability of dividing this labour into classes has exercised the minds of your Committee, but, from information derived from the Surveyor, classification, even to a REPORT, 1892-93. 93 limited extent, is undesirable. Your Committee have, therefore, framed recommendations so as to cover the entire staff of sweepers. As regards the Foremen of Road Sweepers, your Committee consider that their wages should be regulated according to length of service, such service to date from the time when first employed under the Vestry. They therefore recommend:— A.— That the wages of Road Sweepers be raised from 2s. 8d. to 3s. per day—in other words, from 16s. to 18s. per week; the rate for overtime to Sweepers to be raised from 3½d. to 4d. per hour; and that the Road Foremen's wages be regulated as follows :— 21s. per week up to 5 years' service, 22s. per week between 5 and 10 years' service, 23s. per week between 10 and 15 years, and a maximum of 24s. per week after 15 years. ROAD PECKERS. 4.—Taking into consideration the amount paid under the head of labour by other Local Authorities, the wages of these men should, in the opinion of your Committee, be increased. As regards the two Foremen, who are receiving respectively 25s. and 26s. per week, your Committee consider that 26s. should be the maximum weekly wage. They therefore recommend— B That the wages of the Peckers be raised from 3s. 94 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. to 3/4 per day, or from 18s. to 20s. per week, and of the second foreman from 25s. to 26s. as a maximum weekly wage. SPREADERS. 5.—For the reasons above-mentioned, your Committee would also recommend— C.—That the wages of the Road Spreaders be raised from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 8d. per day, or from 21s. to 22s. per week, and the Foremen from 22s. to 23s. per week. WOOD-PAYING AND WHARF LABOURERS. 6.—Your Committee recommend— D.—That the wages of these men be raised as follows: — 9 Labourers on Wood-paving Works, from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 8d. per day, or from 21s. to 22s. per week. 23 Labourers on No. 26 Wharf. 3 „ on Bridge House Wharf. 2 „ on No. 10 Wharf. 28 Labourers from 3s. to 3s. 4d. per day, or from 18s. to 20s. per week. CARMEN (Material Cart and Water Yan Drivers, and slopmen). 7.—Your Committee find that although the wages in this department are regulated so as to enable each man to earn 85 REPORT, 1892-93. 4s. per day, the majority of the men, provided a given quantity of work be finished, have opportunities during certain conditions of weather, of increasing their pay by doing extra load work (occasionally during working hours). 8. From an examination of the Wages Book your Committee find that the weekly amount of wages, both in summer and winter, is as follows:— 23 Carmen, making full time during the week ending 19th February, 1892 .£1 10 9| 40 Dustmen for the same period 1 0 1¾ During the week ending June 17th last, 44 Carmen working full hours and overtime, averaged each 1 6 2| 36 Dustmen for the same period averaging 1 1 3 9.—it happens sometimes that Carmen are otherwise employed on the Wharf, in which case their regular rate of wages is reduced from 4s. to 3s. 6d. per day. While your Committee see no reason for making an increase in the ordinary rate of wages in respect of this class of labour, they would recommend— E.—That Carmen when employed on an inferior kind of work be paid the usual rate of wages, the men in question being in no way responsible for the change effected in their daily occupation. 96 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. STEAM-ROLLER MEN, ARTISANS, MASONS, AND PAVIORS. 10.—Your Committee see no reason for increasing the wages of these men; but they would recommend— F.—That the pay of the twelve Mason's Labourers, and the Pavior's Labourers be increased as follows :— 2 Mason's Labourers from 5½d. to 6d. per hour. 1 „ Labourer „ 5d. „ 5£d. „ 9 „ Labourers „ 3s. 4d. „ 3s. 6d. per day. Pavior's Labourers „ 3s. 4d. „ 3s. 6d. „ Rammermen „ 4s. „ 4s. 2d. „ SIFTING MACHINE. 11.—Your Committee would observe that the wages of the hands employed on the Sifting Machine have been already raised. LIGHTING DEPARTMENT, LAMPLIGHTERS. 12.—Your Committee would recommend— G.—That the wages of the Lamplighters be regulated as under:— Lamplighters, Foremen, per week. per week. For the first three years' service 21s. 25s. After three years and up to ten years' service 22s. 26s. After ten years' service 23s. 27s. 97 REPORT, 1892-93. HOLIDAYS. 13.—Your Committee would recommend— H.—That the following holidays in the year be allowed with full pay and a gratuity of 2s. 6d. on Christmas Day:— Christmas Day. Easter Monday. Boxing Day. Whit Monday. Good Friday. 1st Monday in August "Bank Holiday." And a day for the Annual Beanfeast. SICK PAY. 14.—Your Committee find that the system adopted by the Surveyor as regards sick allowance compares favourably with the arrangements in force in other Parishes, and they recommend that such practice be continued. 15.—Your Committee are not prepared to make any recommendations as regards the men's application to be treated as weekly servants, neither do they consider it expedient that the Surveyor's authority should be weakened by the Committee constituting itself a Court of Appeal for redressing alleged grievances. 16.—In conclusion, your Committee would observe that at no time has there been difficulty in obtaining labour, there being as a rule from 20 to 30 men at the Wharf each morning awaiting employment.

Sir, I am instructed by the Burial Board to transmit to you Statements in abstract of the Account of the Board, and of the Incumbent of Paddington, for the Year ending 25th March, 1893, certified by Mr. Wilde (of Messrs. Wilde and Venables, Chartered Accountants), and audited by the Parochial Auditors. A Statement showing the amount of Fees received by the Incumbent and the Board during the last three years is likewise appended. From the balance at the commencement of the financial year a further sum of £1,500 was paid over to the Vestry account, making a total of £42,100 since 1870, when the loan raised for the purchase and laying-out of the ground was cleared off. The following shows the number of burials which took place from the 31st March, 1892, to the 1st April, 1893 :— I 2 124 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. CONSECRATED GROUND. Parishioners. Non-Parishioners.

In the preceding year the number of interments in the Consecrated Ground was 1,306, and in the Unconsecrated Ground 1,163. The Board has, after protracted negociations with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Willesden Local Board, completed arrangements whereby the drainage of the Cemetery has been put into a satisfactory condition, and which will consequently permit of several additional acres of ground being utilized for burials.

The Commissioners in submitting their Annual Statement of Accounts to the 31st March, 1893, duly audited, have to report:— That the Receipts for the past year have maintained Accounts, the average of the three preceding years, and it will be seen by the following Statement that the Receipts have almost become a known quantity, any increase or decrease being entirely governed by an accession or diminution of fine weather:— £ s. d. 1889-90 3,859 5 6½ 1890-91 3,776 8 8 1891-92 3,866 ro 4 1892-93 3,846 16 11 The Expenditure, which has been carefully watched, has been somewhat heavy for the year. This is principally accounted for by the payment of the balance of account for New Boilers, and by the outlay in Heating improvements which have been effected (and referred ito under the head of Heating Apparatus) with a view to a further reduction in working expenses. 130 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON.

The Building. Floor of Ladies' Swimming Bath. In the month of December last, a settlement occurred on the South side of the Building, which caused another serious leakage in the Ladies' Swimming Bath. After the experience of 1891, when the subsidence took place at the lower end of the Bath, the Commissioners decided to complete the relaying of the bottom of the Bath. The old concrete was taken out to a depth of 18 inches, new concrete was then laid, and the whole, including the part laid in 1891, covered with glazed bricks, 9 X 4^ X 2^ inches, in substitution of the 5-inch glazed tiles. This work has involved an expenditure of £285. Ladies' Swimming Bath Painted The Roof of the Ladies' Swimming Bath was overhauled and thoroughly repaired in the early Summer of 1892, and the Interior painted, at a cost of £145. REPORT, 1892-93. 131 Gentlemen's ist Class Swimming Bath Painted. The Gentlemen's First Class Swimming Bath was painted and completely repaired, including the Roof, in March, 1893, at a cost of £140. Gallery, Ladies' Swimming Bath. The Gallery erected in the Ladies' Bath last year, is fulfilling the expectations of the Commissioners, it being a source of comfort alike to Bathers and Visitors. Heating Baths by Steam. The laying down of three New Boilers in 1892, has enabled the Commissioners to carry out the Scheme mentioned in the last Report, of heating the First Class Swimming Bath, as also the Ladies' Swimming Bath, by means of Steam Injectors instead of Hot Water. This has already resulted in an economy of fuel. Drying by Steam Pipes. The arrangements for drying the clothes, towels, &c., in the Washhouses being in an advanced state of disrepair, the Commissioners are considering the question of introducing steam pipes in the drying-closets in lieu of the present system, which will no doubt effect a considerable saving in the Coke Account. Electric Lighting. The Lighting of the Large Hall and some other parts of the Building by the Electric Light is in contemplation, and it is hoped before next winter this will have been effected. Heating by Hot Air. The Heating of all the Baths by Hot Air is also under consideration, the constant complaints during the winter of Bathers and those using the Large Hall, making this desirable improvement absolutely necessary. Board School Children. The Commissioners have made arrangements for Board Schoolchildren to attend the 3rd Class Swimming Baths at id. per head. The Children to provide their own towels and bathing dresses. 132 borough of paddington.

Borough of Paddington. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1892. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you the following Report on the Health of the Parish of Paddington of the vital statistics in connexion therewith and of the work of the Sanitary Department during the year 1892. Births and Deaths. During the fifty-two weeks of the registration year ending 31st December, 1892, 2,934 births and 2,294 deaths were registered in Paddington. Births. Of the 2,934 births, comprising 1,489 male and 1,445 female children, 2,456 occurred in St. Mary's and 478 in St. John's Sub-district. 168 The proportion of males to females among the children born in the Parish was 100 males to 97 females, whereas in the Metropolis it was 100 males to 96 females. The births were most numerous during the third and least so in the fourth quarter of the year. The ratio of births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 to every 41 inhabitants, or 24.6 per 1,000 inhabitants of all ages. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to the population was 1 to every 35 inhabitants, or 28.5 per 1,000 living. In St. John's the ratio of births to population was 1 to 69, or 14.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. Some of the preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. Mary's 86,111 2,456 1 to 35 28.5 St. John's 33,149 478 1 to 69 14.4 Paddington .. 119,260 2,934 1 to 41 24-6 The Birth-rate in London was 30.9 „ „ England & Wales was 30.5 „ „ Paddington 24.6 Deaths. The total number of deaths registered in Paddington during the year was 2,294. Of this number, 255 169 were of non-parishioners who died in St. Mary's Hospital, 10 were of non-parishioners who died in the Children's Hospital, and 7 were of non-parishioners who died in the Lock Hospital, making a total of 272 non-parishioners who died in the Parish. Deducting these non-parishioners, it will be seen that 2,022 parishioners died actually in Paddington. To this number must be added the deaths of 120 parishioners in extra-parochial hospitals and public institutions, making a corrected total of 2,142—1,025 males and 1,117 females—equivalent to an annual death-rate of 18.0 per 1,000 inhabitants. The natural increase of population from the excess of births over deaths was 792, as compared with 842 in the previous year. Of the 2,142 deaths, 1,632 occurred in St. Mary's and 510 in St. John's Sub-district. The subjoined table shows that the deaths were most numerous in the first, and least so in the third quarter of the year. Quarter. St. Mary's. St. John's. Paddington. First 571 181 752 Second 403 129 532 Third 309 97 406 Fourth 349 103 452 Total 1,632 510 2,142 M 170 In the Public Institutions in the Parish there were 610 deaths, viz., 53 in the Workhouse, 183 in the Paddington Infirmary, 12 in the Children's Hospital, 355 in St. Mary's Hospital, and 7 in the Lock Hospital. The 53 deaths in the Workhouse—13 males and 40 females, and the 183 deaths in the Paddington Infirmary—90 males and 93 females—being regarded as those of parishioners, are included in the 1,632 deaths in St. Mary's Sub-district; 255 of the deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 10 of the deaths in the Children's Hospital, and the 7 deaths in the Lock Hospital, were of non-parishioners, and are therefore not dealt with in this Report. The following table shows the ratio of deaths to the population, together with the death-rate per 1,000 of the population of the parish and of its two Subdistricts:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Death Rate per 1,000.

The 120 deaths of parishioners—96 from St. Mary's Sub-district and 24 from St. John's— M 2 172 which occurred in 1892 in the following extraParochial Hospitals and Institutions, are throughout this Report dealt with in the same manner as if they had actually taken place in the Parish, and are assigned in the Tables to the Sub-districts from which the deceased were admitted.

The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 148 per 1,000 registered births. In London the rate was 155, and in the 33 largest provincial towns it ranged from 123 in Croydon to 216 in Preston. The 683 deaths of children under 5 years of age constituted 31.9 per cent. of the total deaths. 209 of these deaths were due to one or other of the seven principal zymotic diseases, of which 180 occurred in St. Mary's, and 29 in St. Johns Sub-district. Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases was 248, and was equivalent to an annual rate of 2.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London, the zymotic death-rate was equivalent to an annual 174 rate of 2.82 per 1,000 inhabitants. In the 33 largest provincial towns, it ranged from 1.48 in Huddersfield to 4.58 in Salford. Small-pox caused no death in Paddington, nor did any case come under the notice of the Sanitary Department. In London there were 41 deaths, equivalent to a death-rate of 0.01 per 1,000 inhabitants. Measles caused 81 deaths—73 in St. Mary's and 8 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to a death-rate of 0.68 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of deaths from this disease during the two preceding years was 7 and 77. In London there were 3,393 deaths, equivalent to a rate of 0.80 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.61. Scarlet Fever caused 17 deaths—13 in St. Mary's and 4 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to a rate of 0.14 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of deaths in the preceding year was 7. 528 cases—398 in St. Mary's and 130 in St. John's Sub-district—were notified during the year to the Sanitary Department as compared with 259 in the preceding year. 312 of these cases—245 from St. Mary's and 67 from St. John's Sub-district— were removed to Hospital, the remainder—153 in St. Mary's and 63 in St. John's —being treated at home. 175 In London there were 1,174 deaths, equivalent to a rate of 0.28 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average rate in the preceding decennium having been 0.29. This was the twelfth successive year in which the mortality from this disease was below the previous decennial period. Diphtheria caused 32 deaths—18 in St. Mary's and 14 in St. John's Sub-district—as compared with 27 and 45 in the two preceding years. The rate was 0.27 per 1,000 inhabitants. 175 cases—135 in St. Mary's and 40 in St. John's Sub-district—were notified daring the year to the Sanitary Department as compared with 184 in the preceding year. 82 of these cases—63 from St. Mary's and 19 from St. John's Sub-district were removed to Hospital, the remainder 72 in St. Mary's and 21 in St. John's Sub-district— were treated at home. All the houses in which the deaths occurred were carefully inspected, attention being specially directed in each case to the condition of the water supply and to the soundness of the house-drain, as proved either by the water-test, or by the smoke-test, or by the peppermint-test. In the large majority of cases defects of some sort were discovered, and were subsequently made good. The localities in which deaths from this disease occurred are shewn in Table Va. 176 In London there were 1,885 deaths, equivalent to a rate of 0.44 per 1,000 inhabitants, this being the highest rate as yet recorded, the next highest having been 0.39 in 1889. Whooping Cough caused 29 deaths—25 in St. Mary's and 4 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to an annual rate of 0.24 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of deaths in the preceding year was 67. In London there were 2,477 deaths, equivalent to a rate of 0.58 per 1,000 inhabitants. Fever (Typhoid) caused 7 deaths as compared with 17 in the preceding year. All occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district, and were equivalent to a rate of 0.6 per 1,000 inhabitants. 47 cases—31 in St. Mary's and 16 in St. John's Sub-district—were notified during the year to the Sanitary Department as compared with 65 in the preceding year. 19 of these cases—13 from St. Mary's and 6 from St. John's Sub-district—were removed to Hospital, the remainder—18 in St. Mary's and 10 in St. John's Sub-district—being treated at home. In London there were 467 deaths, equivalent to a rate of 0.11 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.20. Diarrhoea caused 82 deaths—71 in St. Mary's and 11 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to a rate of 177 0.69 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of deaths in the preceding year was 76. In London there were 2,546 deaths, equivalent to a rate of 0.60, the annual average rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.72. Influenza caused 96 deaths—61 in St. Mary's and 35 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to a rate of 0.80 per 1000 inhabitants. 87 of the deaths occurred during the first quarter of the year. In London the deaths directly ascribed to influenza were 2,264 as compared with 2,336 and 652 in 1891 and 1890 respectively. A large number of deaths really due to influenza are certified under other names especially under bronchitis and pneumonia. Disinfection. The disinfection of premises, of small articles of clothing, and of furniture, was, as hitherto, done without charge by the Sanitary Department. Bedding, carpets, and woollen fabrics belonging to the poor are cleansed and disinfected by Messrs. Armfield at the cost of the parish. During the year 450 cwt. 3 qrs. 5 lbs. were thus disinfected by that firm, involving an expenditure of £676 3s. 7d. A further sum of £39 18s. 5d. was paid for chemicals and carbolic soap, thus raising the cost incurred by the Sanitary Department for disinfection to the sum of £716 2s. 0d. 178 Canal Basin. The water in the Canal Basin was run off on April 16th, 1892, and about 600 tons of mud removed. It was again emptied on July 23rd, when more mud was removed. Water. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies, which draw their supplies from the Thames, as do also the Chelsea, the Lambeth, the Southwark, and Vauxhall Companies. The remaining Metropolitan Water Companies are the Kent Company, whose water is drawn from the deep wells, and the New River Company and East London Company, both of which derive their water from the River Lea and other sources. For the purposes of comparison, Professor Frankland, in his annual report to the Registrar-General on the condition of these waters during 1892, includes also the results of similar examinations of the water supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the Tottenham Local Board of Health. He states that except in November and December the weather during the year 1892 has been on the whole not unfavourable for the operations of the Companies who derive water from the rivers Thames and Lea, and the quality of their supplies has, except in December, been much more uniformly good and less subject to violent fluctuations than during the previous year. The want of additional storage reservoirs, and, in some cases, of larger filter areas, is 179 still very emphatically declared both by the chemical and bacteriological examinations. All the samples examined were taken directly from the mains of the several Companies. In addition to the chemical analysis to which each sample was submitted, the temperature of the water as it issued from the main, at the time of its collection, was determined, and the appearance which it exhibited on being viewed in a two-foot tube was recorded. Nearly all the samples were submitted to bacteriological examination. Temperature: Although the average temperature differs but little for the several supplies, the monthly variation in the case of the river waters is very great, whilst the temperature of the deep-well water is practically constant throughout the year. Thus the water principally derived from the Thames and supplied by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, South wark, Grand Junction, and Lambeth Companies, varied in temperature from 37°.6 Fahr. in January to 68°.0 Fahr. in August, and the water of the Lea distributed by the New River and East London Companies fluctuated from 38°.8 Fahr. in January to 66°.9 Fahr. in August. The deep-well water of the Kent Company on the other hand, was free from these violent fluctuations, and practically maintained a constant temperature throughout the year This uniformity of temperature of deep-well water is of considerable importance, as the water is cool and refreshing in summer and is less likely to become frozen in the service-pipes in winter. 180 The solid matters in the water are almost wholly composed of mineral substances, which, in the proportion in which they exist in Metropolitan waters, in no way diminish the fitness of the water for drinking. But the salts of lime and magnesia which constitute the principal part of these mineral ingredients are objectionable, not only because they impart to the water what is known as "hardness," and thus render it unsuitable for washing, but also because they cause incrustations and deposits in steam and kitchen boilers and hot-water pipes. The saline matters dissolved in the deep-well water from the chalk are considerably greater in amount than those found in the river water, and inasmuch as this chalk-water is sent out in its natural condition by the Kent and East London Companies and by the Tottenham Local Board of Health, these supplies contained in two out of three cases, more solid matter than any of the others. The Colne Valley Company, on the other hand, by treating this chalk-water with lime before delivery, so reduced the solid matter that the latter was one-third less than the amount present in the river waters, and was about one-half of that in the deep-well waters either of the Kent Company or of the Tottenham Local Board of Health. The comparatively small proportion of organic material which the solid matter invariably contains is, on the other hand, of great importance in connexion with the use of the water for drinking purposes. For 181 although the actual amount of this organic matter is often quite insignificant, yet it may be of the most objectionable character on account of its origin. Thus the water, both of the Thames and the Lea, receives, above the points where it is abstracted for the purposes of the Metropolitan supply, various contributions of organic matter of animal origin, such as the drainage from manured land, the effluents from sewage works, and even raw sewage itself. This animal matter may, at any time, be accompanied by zymotic poisons dangerous to health, and although the chances of such substances reaching the water-consumer are enormously reduced, both by the care which is exercised in excluding the flood-waters from the reservoirs, and especially by the efficient filtration to which the water is subjected before distribution; yet, in spite of these protective measures, there is no absolute guarantee that the noxious ingredients, which may at any time be present, are wholly removed. Most of the Companies are endeavouring to substitute as far as possible water from subterranean sources for raw river water, whilst the Board of Conservators have almost completely stopped the discharge of untreated town sewage into the Thames. Table A gives the proportion of organic impurity present in the waters taken from the Thames, the Lea, and the deep-wells respectively, from 1868 to 1892. From the figures there given it will be seen that the Thames water distributed during the year 1892 was 182 of much better average quality than that distributed during the previous year. Of the waters chiefly derived from the River Lea, that supplied by the New River Company contained, in every case, less organic matter than that of the East London Company, which was generally, in this respect, somewhat superior to the best of the Thames waters. Table B shows the maximum, minimum, and average proportions of organic impurity in each of the waters, the average amount contained in the Kent Company's water during the nine years ending December, 1876, being taken as unity. In Table C are recorded the results of observations respecting the freedom from turbidity or otherwise of various waters, and for the purposes of comparison, the results of similar observations made in 1868 are also included. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, June, 1803. 183 TABLE B.
