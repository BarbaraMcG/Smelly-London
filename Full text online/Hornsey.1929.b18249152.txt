Ladies and Gentlemen, I present herewith my Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Hornsey for the year 1929. The year has been one of changes in the staff of the Department. Dr. W. W. Jameson was appointed to the distinguished position of Professor of Public Health in the University of London—the most important chair for the teaching of preventive medicine in the British Empire. He relinquished duty as Medical Officer of Health for Hornsey on December 31st, 1928, to take up his new work at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr. J. B. Prior, who, for many years, has combined the duties of Resident Medical Superintendent of the Hornsey, Finchley and Wood Green Joint Isolation Hospital with those of Deputy Medical Officer of Health and School Medical Inspector in the Borough of Hornsey, resigned from the latter positions on December 31st, 1929, in order to devote his entire time to the increasing work of the Isolation Hospital. Although Professor Jameson and Dr. Prior are no longer officials of the Council, they are both still resident in Hornsey, and I am glad to acknowledge their valuable assistance and advice in local public health matters on which I have sought their opinion. It was decided to appoint a whole-time woman Assistant Medical Officer to undertake combined duties under Health, Maternity and Child Welfare, and Education Committees. Dr. Edith I. L. Abbott was appointed to fill this position and commenced duty on April 28th, 1930. It is with deep regret that I have to record the sudden death on August 5th, 1929, of Mr. William Thorpe, Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Borough for 26 years. Although my association with Mr. Thorpe was brief—about seven months—it was long enough to impress upon me his sterling character and outstanding ability in the discharge of his duties. The position of Chief 5 Sanitary Inspector was filled by the promotion of Mr. Henry Eastwood. Mr. A. E. Gooday was appointed a Sanitary Inspector on December 30th to complete the staff. The work of the department in all its branches has continued smoothly during the year along the same lines as in former years. The Report which follows gives as briefly as possible the statistical information required in an " Ordinary Report." The Minister of Health requests that every five years a more elaborate report should be prepared surveying the progress made in the quinquennium. Such a " Survey Report " is due next year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 11. P. GARROW. 6 STATISTICS FOR 1929. Social and Economic Statistics.

There are 13 Fried Fish shops in the Borough. These have been inspected frequently in order to see that the Byelaws are observed. There are no Rag and Bone Dealers' premises in the Borough. COMPLAINTS. Complaints were received in respect of 598 alleged nuisances. All the premises concerned were inspected and where nuisances were found the necessary steps were taken to have them abated. Smoke Abatement.—During the year observation has been kept on six occasions regarding complaints of smoke, resulting in the mitigation of the nuisance. Shoot, Coolhurst Avenue.—A number of complaints were received during the year respecting this shoot. Frequent visits were made, particularly during the summer months. Although, as a rule, the material tipped was of an inorganic nature, several instances occurred when organic matter was deposited. Prompt action was taken with both the representative of the owners of the land and also with the contractor tipping here when anything offensive was discovered. Complaints of rats in connection with the shoot were referred to the Pats Officer of the Middlesex County Council. 16 Shoot, Cold fall Estate.—A number of complaints were received during the latter part of the year respecting this shoot and frequent visits were made. Co-operation between this department and the department concerned, with regard to the treatment of refuse here, which contained a quantity of organic matter, resulted in the prevention of fly-breeding and the mitigation of the nuisance complained of. Paige's Potato Crisps.—Complaints were received in connection with these premises. Frequent visits were made by the Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and considerable improvement followed the carrying out of suggestions made. The first has since closed down. Rag Flock Act, 1911 & 1928.—Four visits have been made to upholsterers' premises where rag flock is used.

Nkwland Road Estate.—The 33 flats on land in Newland Road will be ready for occupation in April, 1930, and will be primarily used to allocate the worst known cases of inadequate housing. During 1929 there were 73 houses and 12 flats erected by private enterprise, and 6 houses were converted into flats. Details of the remainder of the Borough Housing Schemes were set out in the Report for 1927. MILK. Dairies and Milkshopr. At the end of the year there were 31 dairies within the Borough and 35 other shops from which milk was retailed. Eighteen dairymen supply milk within the Borough who operate from other districts. As the result of careful investigation it is estimated that the total quantity of milk sold per week in the Borough is 363,144 pints, and the amount of milk consumed per head per day on the basis of a population of 90,000 is about half a pint. There are no cowsheds within the Borough. The dairies and milkshops are inspected periodically and, generally speaking, a high standard of cleanliness exists. The Milk (Special Designation) Order. During the year licences were granted as follows: — Premises licensed for sale of Pasteurised Milk 18 Premises licensed for sale of Certified Milk 7 Premises licensed for sale of Grade "A" (T.T.)

(v) Engines used in connection wath the making or repair of roads. 2.—The Petroleum (Carbide of Calcium) Order, 1929, a copy of which was received on the 6th December, 1929, makes further provision for the safe keeping and distinctive labelling of Carbide of Calcium. The number of premises licensed by the Council has steadily increased from year to year especially in regard to bulk storage in underground tanks, there being no less than 96 of these in the Borough with their corresponding pumps. The total number of licences for petroleum spirit is 69 and the quantity of petroleum which may be kept on licensed premises is 70,934 gallons. The total number of licences for Carbide of Calcium is 3 and the quantity which may be stored is 1 ton 11 cwts. There is 1 licence for the storage of Hydro-Carbon. 23 Certain mixtures, such as Cellulose paint, come within th Petroleum Act. There is 1 place licensed solely for Cellulose paint. During the year 8 additional licences to keep Petroleur Spirit were granted. The licence fee varies according to the quantity of Petroleur Spirit kept. The licence fees paid during 1929 amounted t £42 3s. Od. The premises licensed were inspected from time to time an. contraventions of the conditions attached to the licences deal with. All plans relating to new installations have been submitte to the Committee for their approval, following which the con struction of new installations has been carefully supervised an tanks and pipe-lines for bulk storage installations tested befor the licence has been given to store petroleum. Horticultural Poisons.—There are two licences in fore for the sale of Horticultural Poisons under the Poisons an Pharmacy Act. SHOPS ACT, 19 12.

This Act makes permanent the general closing of shops (with certain exceptions) not later than 9.0 p.m. on the " late day," which is Saturday, and not later than 8 p.m. on any other day in the week. The Act now applies to the sale of tobacco, the sale of newspapers in shops (but not in the streets), and the sale of soft fruit and fresh fish. The closing hours for the sale of table water, sweets or other sugar confectionery and ice cream are fixed at 10 p.m. on the " late day " and 9.30 on other days. The sale of tobacco, sweets or other sugar confectionery and ice cream is permitted in places of entertainment at any time during a performance so long as the sale is to a bona-fide member of the audience. Regular inspections have been made in regard to the closing of shops at the hours set out in the Act and also attention has been paid to hawkers, who mostly come from outside the district and endeavour to sell their wares after the regular shops are closed, and who, moreover, cause much annoyance and disturbance by shouting. Letters have been sent in 7 instances where contraventions have occurred after verbal notices and undertakings obtained that recurrences will not take place. Three hawkers, all living outside the Borough, have been warned verbally and communicated with for selling after the closing hours. Generally speaking, however, this Act has been well observed. 26 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Full information as to the incidence and hospital isolation of cases of infectious disease is furnished in Table E. The only unusual feature of these figures is the high mortality from pneumonia. A majority of the deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year in old persons and is explained by the exceptional severity of the winter of 1928-29.

X-Ray Treatment. —Five expectant mothers were sent to University College Hospital for X-ray examination. Dental Clinic for Mothers.—The scheme for the dental treatment of mothers continues to be taken advantage of, the sessions being so fully occupied that it is still not possible to treat children. The details of the scheme were set out in the Annual Report for 1928. The following is a record of the work during the year: — Mothers. Individual cases treated 154 Total attendances made 529 Teeth extracted 547 Gas cases 130 Inspections 57 Local injections 5 Fillings 82 Dentures provided 33 Awaiting dentures 26 Attendances for dentures 192 Other treatments, scaling, gum treatment, &c. 93 Cases finished 68 Voluntary Committees. — The Centres could not well be carried on without the valuable help of the Voluntary Committees.

To the Chairman and Members of the Hornsey Education Committee. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for 1920 on the work of the School Medical Service. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. P. GARROW, School Medical Officer. 4 CO-ORDINATION. The general arrangements for carrying on the work of the school medical service and co-ordinating it with other health services of the Borough and of the County of Middlesex—infant and child welfare, tuberculosis, etc—were the same in 1929 as in previous years. The most noteworthy event was the resignation of Dr. J. R. Prior—to take effect at the end of the year—from the position of School Medical Inspector and School Oculist. Dr. Prior has done the medical inspection and the work of school oculist for many years, and I desire to take this opportunity of expressing my admiration for the skill and devotion with which he has carried out these duties. But the increasing demands on his time and energy on account of the expanding work of the Hornsey, Finchley and Wood Green Joint Isolation Hospital have made it necessary for him to devote his entire time to the Hospital. The rearrangement of the medical services consequent on his resignation involves the appointment of a whole-time woman Assistant Medical Officer, whose time will be divided between the School Medical and Maternity and Child Welfare Services. (Dr. Edith I. L. Abbott commences these combined duties on April '28th, 1930.) SCHOOL HYGIENE. With certain exceptions the hygienic conditions in the schools generally are quite good. The exceptions are: — Major Defects. (1) Holy Innocents'.—This school was certified in 1924 as unsuitable for continued recognition and incapable of improvement. (2) Crouch End.—Requires alterations and improvements. (3) Muswell Hill—St. James's (Church of England).—The Managers have under consideration plans for improving the heating, lighting and ventilation of the school, for reconstruction of the offices and for the provision of a hall. 5 Minor Dejects uj Hygiene. (1) The heating of North Harringay School is at present engaging the attention of the Works Sub-Committee. (2) The sanitary accommodation is not up to modern standards at certain of the schools. For example, there are trough closets with automatic flush at Stroud Green, Campsbourne, Crouch End and Highgate; and at a number of the schools the urinals are unglazed. Improvements in School Hygiene. St. Mary's (Church op England).—In 1924 this school was placed by the Board of Education in List B., schools which ought not to be recognised in their present condition—at all events for their present numbers—but which might possibly be' made suitable either for the same or for reduced numbers—but only by large expenditure. Through the generosity of David Greig, Esq., first Freeman of Hornsey (1920), the school has undergone complete reconstruction and extension, and is now well up to modern requirements. Campsbourne.—An important advance in school hygiene was the provision of a set of twelve spray baths, with hot and cold water, at Campsbourne. These are used by the boys on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and by the girls on Mondays and Wednesdays. They were opened in June, 1929, and between 300 and 400 boys and girls enjoy a bath each week. MEDICAL INSPECTION. The work of medical inspection was carried out as in former years by Dr. Prior at all the elementary schools, with the exception of the Boys' and Girls' Departments at Campsbourne, Crouch End, North Harringay and Stroud Green, which were done by the School Medical Officer. Complete medical examination according to the Board of Education Schedule was carried out in every school of all children in the three age groups—entrants, intermediates, leavers. FINDINGS OF MEDICAL INSPECTION. The facts revealed by medical inspection are set out in Table II. Without discussing the figures of this table in detail under the different defects or diseases, the general impression left on 6 one's mind as a result of the medical examination of about 1,300 of the children is that the standard of cleanliness is high and the incidence of serious disease or defect is low. In spite of this the standard of health in quite a considerable number of the children—fully 10 per cent.—is not nearly so good as it ought to be. In too many of the children there is a tendency to ansemia, under-weight, lack of tone, round shoulders, flat chest and potbelly. These signs indicate not so much the presence of disease as the absence of health. They point clearly to the need for still more education of mothers in the proper feeding of their offspring in infancy, through early childhood and during the school period. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The common infectious diseases prevailed to an average extent in the schools during the year, without anything of a noteworthy character occurring. No school department was closed on account of infection. FOLLOWING UP. Following up of children requiring attention is done by the staff of three School Nurses, who paid 1,335 visits to schools and 1,582 home visits. MEDICAL TREATMENT. Minor ailments have been attended to medically one session per week at the school clinic at Croueh End. Skin diseases, sores and other conditions requiring local treatment are attended to each evening by the Clinic Nurse at Crouch End and each morning at Brook Road, Highgate and Coldfall Centres. Operations for the cure of defects associated with adenoids and enlarged tonsils have been transferred from the School Clinic to the Hornsey Central Hospital, where the children receive in-patient treatment till the surgeon is of opinion the child may proceed to its home. Cases in which there is any suspicion of tuberculosis are referred to the Tuberculosis Officer of the County Council. Defective vision is treated by the School Oculist at the School Clinic—two sessions per week—and external eye diseases are treated by the School Nurses under his supervision. Defective hearing and ear diseases receive treatment one session per week by the Aurist, Dr. A. R. Friel, who furnishes the following analysis of the cases dealt with : — 7 CASE'S OF OTORRHEA.

Crippling defects and orthopaedic conditions have been referred to the special Orthopaedic Hospitals and Departments in London, but a schemc has been adopted, with the approval of the Board of Education, for the treatment of these conditions at the School Clinic and at the lloyal National Orthopaedic Hospital and its Country Branch Hospital at Stanmore. This scheme will come into operation when the Education Office is moved to its new quarters at Beacon Lodge and a room is available for equipment as an orthopaedic clinic. OPEN-AIR EDUCATION. Playground classes are hold in all the elementary schools when weather permits and at the discretion of the teachers. School journeys were undertaken by boys from Campsbourne School to Epping Forest and to the Isle of Wight. Boys from Highgate and boys and girls from Campsbourne attended holiday camps by the seaside. 8 There are open-air classrooms at Campsbourne Infants', St. •James's and North Harringay Junior Schools. The question of the erection of a day open-air school for delicate .and cripple children has engaged your Committee's attention for some years, and it was decided to postpone the proposed scheme at Coldfall for two years. Residential Open-Air Schools.—Four beds are reserved for Hornsey children (2 boys and 2 girls) at the Russell-Cotes School of Recovery, Parkstone, Dorset. During the year 32 children (16 boys and 16 girls) spent six weeks at Parkstone. The same number of beds (2 for boys and 2 for girls) are reserved at the Ogilvie School of Recovery, CLacton, where the children spend longer periods. During 1929, 3 boys and 1 girl went to Clacton. Through the agency of the Central Care Committee 100 children (42 boys and 64 girls) were also sent to various holiday and convalescent homes. PHYSICAL TRAINING. There is no organiser of physical training, but organised games and sports are played at all the schools and at the school ploying field at Redston Road. Mr. L. W. Gilbert, Hon. Secretary of the Hornsey Schools' Sports Association, reports that: — " The usual competitions in tennis, netball, cricket, football, athletics and swimming have been carried out. With the entry of new schools, and of schools which have not always been able to enter in the past, the Saturday morning programmes are now so full that it is difficult to find time for all the necessary games to be played. Roth the Redston Road ground and that at Rokesly Avenue are used to their full capacity. " The games are fought out in the best sporting spirit. They are played in no ' trophy-hunting ' mood, but in an atmosphere of sportsmanship and good fellowship. It is very pleasing to note that the competitors often spontaneously express their appreciation of their opponents' successes. " The Association again desire to express its appreciation of the generous help it continues to receive from the Borough Council, the Education Committee and thei Council's officers." 9 PROVISION OF MEALS. Sections 82 to 80 of the Education Act, 1921, are not in force in Hornsey. A majority of the schools have adopted the scheme of the National Milk Publicity Council, under which each child may obtain in the middle of the morning session for one penny one-third of a pint of milk in a sealed bottle with a sterile straw, through which to take the milk. About 1,600 children take advantage of this scheme, with benefit to their health and well-being. A much larger proportion of the children could, with equal benefit, partake of this milk. SCHOOL BATHS. The swimming bath at South Harringay School is available for children from all the elementary schools in Hornsey and about 2,000 children per week use it from May to September. There is also an arrangement by which Hornsey children may use the swimming bath of the Islington Borough Council in Hornsey Road. The beautiful new open-air swimming pool in Park Road, opened by the Mayor of Hornsey in 1929, is also available for school children on special terms. CO-OPERATION OF PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL ATTENDANCE OFFICERS AND VOLUNTARY BODIES, Previous annual reports of your School Medical Officers have recorded the methods adopted to obtain the closest co-operation between the staff of the School Medical Service, the children's parents, the teaching staff, attendance officers and voluntary workers in securing medical treatment, surgical appliances, spectacles and other necessities. It is a pleasure to record that all these persons and agencies act together in perfect harmony through the four District Care Committees and the Central Care Committee, the work of which is very complete and effective. BLIND, DEAF, DEFECTIVE AND EPILEPTIC CHILDREN. (a) Ascertainment.—Table III. represents the numbers of children of school age known to be defective within the meaning of Part V. of the Education Act, 1921, on the 31st of December, 10 1920, and the manner in which their education is provided for. It is the most important statistical return made by School Medical Officers to their Education Authorities and to the Board of Education. Every effort has been and is being made to render this table accurate up to the end of each year. I propose to deal at greater length with the difficult question of defective children in my next annual report. (b) Supervision of Mentally Defective Children not in Special Schools. — Mentally defective children not in special schools* are supervised at the occupation centre, Shropshire Hall, Gladstone Avenue, Wood (Jreen. The total number in attendance at this centre is 29, of whom (3 are from the Borough of Hornsey. (c) Wokk of Special Schools.—Blind children are sent to residential schools for the blind, deaf children to the Tottenham School for the Deaf, mentally defective children to the Joint Special School, Oak Lodge, Finchley, and physically defective children to special hospitals, homes or other institutions suited to their needs. NURSERY SCHOOLS. There are no nursery schools in the Borough of Hornsey. SECONDARY SCHOOLS. Medical inspection of children attending Secondary Schools is delegated by the Middlesex County Council to the Local Education Authority. The work is carried out by general practitioners in the Borough under the general supervision of the School Medical Officer. CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. There is no scheme of medical inspection of pupils in attendance at Continuation Schools. EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS. Hornsey is not an industrial area, and there is no employment of children or young persons in trade processes detrimental to their health. 11 The Juvenile Employment Bureau is housed at Topsfielcl Parade in the same building as the School Clinic. The medical records are available for consultation by the Juvenile Employment Officer and any special examination required is carried out at the School Clinic. SPECIAL ENQUIRIES. At the suggestion of Professor W. W. Jameson, Dr. Crowden, Lecturer in Physiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, conducted an investigation into the incidence of loss of hearing by means of the audiometer. This investigation will be the subject of a special report later. MISCELLANEOUS. All teachers taken on the staff are medically examined by the School Medical Officer, who also examines and reports on scholarship children when any question arises as to fitness on grounds of health to undertake secondary education. 13 LIST OF TABLES.
