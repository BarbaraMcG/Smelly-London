XVIII—The Work of the Year. Exceptional activity has marked the past twelve months, owing to the heavy work entailed by the recent Local Enquiries under the London Government Act. Much extra labour has been rendered necessary in the preparation of returns, maps, and evidence required by the Privy Council and the Commissioners under the Act. XIX.—London Government Act, 1899. I he most important subject which has engaged the attention of the Vestry during the past year has 29 REPORT, 1899-1900. been the numerous questions arising upon the passing of the London Government Act. On the day appointed by the Lord President of the Privy Council, the elective Vestry of Paddington will cease to exist, and its powers and duties will be transferred to the Council for the Borough of Paddington, which will include within its boundaries the area of the present parish, excluding on the western and south-western borders three portions which have been granted to Kensington by the Commissioners under the Act. These three portions having a total area of about 26 acres, include:— Part of the south-western side of Kensal Road, the Western and Southern sides of Southam Street, and a portion of the lines and appurtenances of the Great Western and Metropolitan Railways; The area between Cornwall Road, Talbot Road, Ledbury Road and Boundary Mews, part of the southern side of Talbot Road and the western side of Ledbury Road; The western side of Ossington Street, Wellington Terrace (Uxbridge Road), Kensington Palace Gardens, and the paddock or enclosure attached to Kensington Palace. The new Borough will be greater in extent by about 124 acres than the existing parish, by reason of certain additions thereto, including:— 30 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Part of the detached portion of the present parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, comprising the area between Kilburn Lane on the north, the south side of the towing path of the Grand Junction Canal, Wedlake Street, and Kensal Road, on the south, the present parish of Paddington on the east, and Ladbroke Grove Road (by Plough Lane Bridge) and Kilburn Lane on the west. Within these limits there will be contained about 109 acres, or very nearly threequarters of the whole area of the detached portion of Chelsea, which has, in round figures, a rateable value of £72,000, a population of 21,500, about 71/8 miles of public roads, a Free Public Library and Public Baths, both of these institutions being within the portion forming part of the new Borough of Paddington; The eastern side of Ledbury Road, part of the northern side of Westbourne Grove, Norfolk Road, Richmond Road, part of the southern side of Westbourne Grove, the eastern side of Chepstow Place, part of Dawson Place, the eastern side of Pembridge Square, and the northern side of Moscow Road; The detached portion of the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, the houses in front thereof on the northern side of the Uxbridge Road, and the portion of such road upon which these houses abut. The Commissioners have, as far as possible, made such adjustments as will cause the boundary lines of 31 REPORT, 1899-1900. the new Boroughs to run generally along the centres of streets, and many advantages in respect to simplicity of administration will result from the adoption of this course, though considerable labour will be involved in making equitable arrangements between adjoining Boroughs touching the maintenance and repair of roadways, it being manifestly impossible for adjoining authorities to repair that half which actually is vested in them when the boundary line runs longitudinally along the centre of the roadway. The northern boundary of the present parish has been in no way interfered with, as the Act gives no authority to the Commissioners to adjust boundaries of parishes unless both be situate within the administrative County of London. The following is copy Order relating to Councillors and Wards:— LONDON COUNTY. Boroughs. The Borough of Paddington (Councillors and Wards) Order in Council, 1900. At the Court at Windsor, the 29th Day of June, 1900. Present: The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council. Whereas by the Borough of Paddington Order in Council 1900 the area therein described is as from the commencement of that Order formed into a metropolitan borough (in this Order 32 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON, referred to as the borough) under the name of the metropolitan borough of Paddington subject to the adjustment of boundaries therein mentioned and a Council for the borough is established and incorporated. And whereas by section two of the London Government Act 1899 it is amongst other things enacted that an Oder in Council under that Act shall fix the number of councillors, and fix the number and boundaries of the wards, and shall assign the number of councillors to each ward, that number being divisible by three, and regard being had to the rateable value as well as to the population of the wards, and that the number of aldermen shall be one sixth of the number of councillors, and the total number of aldermen and councillors for each borough shall not exceed seventy. Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, and by virtue of the authority committed to Her by the London Government Act 1899, and of all other powers enabling Her in that behalf, for the purposes aforesaid, is pleased to order, and it is hereby ordered as follows:— 1. The number of councillors of the borough shall be sixty. 2. The borough shall be divided into eight wards having the names set out in the Schedule to this Order, and having the boundaries described in that Schedule and to each of the said wards there shall be assigned the number of councillors specified in that Schedule. 3. This Order may be cited as the Borough of Paddington (Councillors and Wards) Order in Council 1900. A. W. Fitzroy. SCHEDULE. Borough of Paddington. Name of Ward-Lancaster Gate East Ward.

Number of Councillors assigned—Six. It will be generally admitted that the government of London will be satisfactorily conducted in proportion to the interest that is taken in the subject by the general public. Unquestionably, the duties performed by London Local Authorities are of great practical importance to the inhabitants of the chief city of the 36 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Empire, and it can scarcely be denied that, speaking broadly, the character of Public Authorities has not been so commensurate with the importance of their duties as has been the case with similar bodies in other towns and cities. It is possible that the explanation of this state of things is to be found in the fact that the duties hitherto assigned to Local Authorities have been comparatively uninteresting, that they have gradually developed from insignificant beginnings, and that in spite of great improvement in recent years, Vestries and Local Boards have not in some cases acquired much importance in public estimation. It has always been recognised that the peculiar circumstances connected with London, involve certain duties being entrusted to a central Authority, and certain other duties being assigned to Local Bodies. These Local Authorities largely owe their origin to miscellaneous Acts of Parliament passed from time to time, more with a view to the needs of particular districts, than with any underlying recognition of a consistent scheme of London Government as a whole. Partly in consequence of their somewhat haphazard origin, and partly because of the relative unattractive¬ness of the duties assigned to them, the transactions ot Local Boards have failed to attract general interest. Whether these facts are cause or consequence of the 37 REPORT, 1899-1900. conspicuous apathy of Londoners in regard to local government there is no need to enquire. Doubtless the apathy of Londoners has prevented many men of means and reputation from taking a prominent part in Metropolitan Government, and doubtless the unattractiveness of local work has tended to. perpetuate the apathy. These remarks in no way imply a failure to recognise the high character of many members of existing Vestries ; nor do they imply any depreciation of the vast amount of excellent work that has been accomplished by them. Even as things are there has been an enormous improvement in Local Authorities and their management of public affairs. The Vestries of several districts have conducted their business with conspicuous ability and success, and by the character of their members, as well as by the erection of Municipal Buildings in which their affairs are conducted, they have shown themselves well fitted to be entrusted with more important duties, and to win for their proceedings a greater share of that public attention which is so essential to the more effective discharge of public affairs. The London Government Act aims at consolidating and extending the powers of Local Authorities. It divides London into Metropolitan Boroughs with a Mayor, Aldermen, 38 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. and Council for each division, and in this way seeks to give to each Borough as much as may be of that corporate life which has proved so efficient in the Provinces. By thus strengthening the Local Authorities, and adding to their dignity and importance, the London Government Act is calculated to confer a practical and lasting benefit upon Londoners. XX.—Assessment Committee. The only appeal (Messrs. Pickford's stabling, yard, &c.) in Harrow Road carried to Assessment Sessions resulted in the rating entered in the Supplemental Valuation List being reduced from Gross £1,400, Rateable £1,1G8, to Gross £1,092, Rateable £910. XXI. — Westbourne Terrace Road and Westbourne Park Bridges. The work connected with the first-mentioned Bridge has been nearly completed, and arrangements have been made for a public opening of the same in the summer. The plans and detailed drawings relating to Westbourne Park Bridge have been completed, and it now rests with the Great Western Railway Company to place the work in hand. 39 REPORT, 1899-1900. XXII.—Coroner's Court. The building operations in connection with the above-mentioned Court have been nearly completed, and the building will be publicly opened during the summer. XXIII.-Town Hall. An interim report upon the above-mentioned subject was presented to the Vestry 011 the 7th November, 1899, when the following resolution was passed, viz.:— "That the Vestry do grant an extension of time from 5th "December, 1899, the date given for presentation of the Report "to the Vestry, until such time as Members of the new Borough "Council shall have been elected." XXIY.—Conferences. Delegates have been appointed to attend Conferences as under, viz.:— Subject. Convened by (a) Snow Removal Paddington Vestry. (b) Storm Flooding do. 40 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON.

During the past year the Hooding of basements of houses in low-lying districts in the Parish during times ol storm, has received the attention of the Vc.stry, and in October last an influential and numerously-attended Conference of Delegates from Vestries, District Boards, and other Authorities affected by the Metropolitan drainage on the North side ol the Thames was held, when the following resolution was passed, viz.:— "That this Conference, comprising rcprosontativos of the "loading Parishes on tho North sido of the Thames horeby placos 43 REPORT, 1899-1900. "on record its surprise that notwithstanding the strong expression "of opinion by the Main Drainage Committee of the London "County Council and its responsible officers, and the repeated "representations of Vestries and District Boards to the effect "that the existing sewer accommodation of the Metropolis was "entirely inadequate to carry out the work required of it—no "attempt should have been made to abate the intolerable evil "complained of; and further, that this Conference urges upon "the Council the absolute necessity of their at once carrying out "such works as may be necessary to remedy the above-mentioned "state of things." The representatives of the Borough at the London County Council were requested to support the foregoing resolution when the report of the Main Drainage Committee shall be submitted to the Council. The Chairman (Mr. Churchwarden Williams, J.P.) has authority to again summon the Conference for the purpose of taking such steps as may be deemed advisable for urging the Council to carry out in sections the main drainage works recently considered by them, in order that the scheme may be completed at the earliest possible moment. The works, sanitary and otherwise, carried out during the year, appear in the Reports of the respective Officers, hereunto annexed, together with the Reports of the Cemetery and Baths Committees, 44 BOROUGH OF PADDlNGTON. such Reports being followed by the documents required by the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act.

Few complaints of flooding have been received, as the heaviest rainfalls which occurred were not so severe as in former years, and ratepayers are also, no doubt, recognising that the Vestry are helpless in this matter, beyond being able to make representations to the culpable authority, the London County Council. As [ have previously reported to you, until more relief sewers are constructed by the London County Council, these floodings must periodically occur with heavy rains.

The number of refuge and special corner lamps, &c., their candle power and gas consumption, &c., will be found on pages 146 and 147. The Gas Company have been served during the year with 314 notices to rectify defective service pipes, and remove accumulation of naphthalene, &c., therefrom. Forty-five reports of damage to lamp-posts, &c., have been received during the year, 4 lamp-posts, columns, and fittings, being completely broken, 21 columns and stand pipes damaged, while in the remaining cases only the lanterns, head-irons, &c., required repairing. The restoration of the above damage was carried out by the Vestry's workmen at a cost of £48 2s. 7d. Accounts have been rendered whenever particulars of the persons causing the damage could be obtained, and £21 17s. 5d. has been received by the 120 BOROUGH OF PADDINOTON.

Incandescent Burner for the same period was 16,410 Shewing a saving of gas during the year in favour of the Incandescent Burner equal to 851 122 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. which at 2s. Id. per 1,000 c. ft. equals Is. 9¼d. Against this saving there is the extra cost of mantles, rods, globes, and the fitter's time fixing the same. The average amount per lamp expended on these items was 13s. 7½d. Deducting the amount saved in gas from the extra amount spent in mantles, &c., and it will be seen that the increased cost for the upkeep of an incandescent burner over the ordinary burner, for the past year, has been 11s. 10¼d.; but it must be remembered that for this extra expenditure a much superior light has been obtained. Electric Arc Lamps—Westbourne Terrace. On one occasion during the past year the Electric Arc Lamps in Westbourne Terrace failed, the whole of them being out of lighting for about one hour during the middle of the evening of the 27th February. The failure was due to an accident at the Amberley Road works of the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company. Complaints had to be made to the Company on several occasions, during the earlier part of the year, of lamps burning out before the proper time, and these have been remedied by new lamps being fitted in place of the defective ones.

These repairs, together with the construction of a large manhole, were carried out at a cost of £77. Drainage. The Committee note with satisfaction that the efforts of the Water Committee to obtain a reduction in the charge for the supply of water has met with a measure of success, the Grand Junction Waterworks Company having agreed to reduce the charge for the supply to the Baths from 6d. per 1,000 gallons to 5d. per 1,000 gallons, from December 1,899. From the opening of the Baths in 1874 to the year 1895 (21 years), the charge for water was at the rate of 4d. per 1,000 gallons, in accordance with an agreement entered into between the Company and the late Commissioners of Baths. At the termination of the agreement the charge was raised to 6d. per 1,000. The Committee are strongly of opinion that when the Baths and Washhouses Act (9 & 10 Vict., cap. 74) was passed, Water. 160 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. it was contemplated by the legislature that the charge for water used for the purpose of Public Baths and Washhouses should not be the same as that used for other purposes, and that the Metropolitan Local Authorities would be justified in seeking redress in this matter, having regard to the terms of the following section of the Act referred to, and to the fact that the bulk of the water used in Baths and Washhouses is taken from the mains at midnight, when the necessity for water for domestic purposes has practically ceased. "xxviii. And be it enacted, That any * * * Water Companies * * may in their discretion grant and furnish supplies of water * * for such Public Baths and Washhouses, and open bathing places, either without charge, or on such other favourable terms as they shall think fit."

REPORT ON VITAL STATISTICS AND SANITARY WORK FOR THE YEAR 1899, BY REGINALD DUDFIELD, M.A., M.B., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. 197 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Sixth Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and results of the Sanitary Administration of the Parish, being the Report for the year 1899. Although the death rate for last year (16.1 per 1,000 of the estimated population) was higher than those for 1898 (15.80) and 1897 (14.33), yet I think that it may be considered satisfactory. In comparison with the published death-rates for the other Metropolitan Districts, it was seventh on the list, that of Hampstead (11.6), the lowest in the Metropolis, being first. The other Districts with lower rates were, Stoke Newington (12.7); St. George, Hanover Square (14.2); Plumstead (14.3); Lee (15.1); and Wandsworth (15.3). Probably in none of these districts does the average density of the population throughout the area equal that of Paddington. The death-rate in St. John's Sub-District, or South Paddington (10.57), was particularly satisfactory, and would be deemed a good advertisement for a health resort. In the Metropolis, as a whole, the mortality was at the rate of 19.3 per 1,000; the highest rate for any district being that of St. Luke, Middlesex, (28.4). The Zymotic Death-Rate for the Parish (1.55) was eleventh in the scale, that for St. Martin's-in-the-Fields (1.07) being the lowest for any district, and that for St. George the Martyr, Southwark (4.53), the highest. The rate for the whole Metropolis was 2.46. In South Paddington the rate was only 0.32, a most 198 satisfactory figure. The mortality from measles in the Parish (0.05 per 1,000) was the lowest in all London, and that from diphtheria (0.23) was much below the mean for the preceding decennium, and compares very favourably with the rates for 1898 (0.50), and 1897 (0'51), years when the general death-rate was lower than last year. The mortality from enteric fever (0.07) was lower than the rate for any of the other Metropolitan Districts, except St. Saviour, Southwark (0.04), and Hampstead (0.05). On the other hand the mortalities from diarrhoea (0.83), and from whooping-cough (0.33), were certainly higher than they should have been. In respect of neither of these diseases are any special measures taken outside what may be termed routine sanitary administration. I would direct your attention to the figures and remarks on the subject of "controlled" and "uncontrolled" infectious diseases on pages 77 et seq. of the Report. Attention may also be directed to the interesting table of comparison on page 108, showing the great reduction in the prevalence of and mortality from certain of the preventable diseases in Cirencester, Clarendon, and Woodchester Streets, as compared with other streets, selected on the ground that they are similarly inhabited by tenement occupiers. There can be little doubt that the inhabitants of most of the streets selected for the comparison are in much better circumstances than are those of the three streets mentioned, and the improvement in the hygienic surroundings indicated by the reductions alluded to is, therefore, all the more satisfactory. The streets mentioned are those which have been selected for the work of registration under the ByeLaws for Houses Let in Lodgings. I venture to think that the results laid before you fully justify the inception of that work, and constitute an ample return for the time and labour given to the supervision of the streets. 199 As this is the last report which I shall have the honour to present to you as a Vestry, I desired to lay before you some figures, comparing the health of the Parish during the earliest years of your corporate existence with the latest. Unfortunately no statistics have been preserved prior to 1868, and I have, therefore, instituted a comparison between the five years 1868-72, and the five years 1895-99.

Such an increase in the density of the population in the absence of municipal control would result in a corresponding increase in the mortality. With the exception of the death-rate from measles, which was the same in the two periods, and those from diphtheria and "cancer," which have increased, all the mean rates given in the Table were lower in the second period than in the first, some of thorn notably so. In reference to diphtheria it should bo mentioned that the diagnosis between that disease and scarlet fever was in the earlier period incomplete, and it will bo safer to combine the mortalities from the two causes in the two periods. The combined mortalities will then compare thus:— COMBINED MORTALITIES: SCARLET FEVER AND DIPHTHERIA. 1868-72. 1895-99. Mean 1.00 0.65 Maximum 1.74 0.72 Minimum 0.41 0.28 If the zymotic diseases be divided into two groups of "controlled" and "uncontrolled," based on present practice, the mean rate for the first group during the first period will be found to be 1.55, and during the second 0.65, equal to a reduction of 58 per cent.; while the rates for the second group are 2.01 and 1.39 respectively, equal to a reduction of 30 per cent. only. It seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that more energetic measures ought to be adopted with the second group of diseases. The increase in the mortality from "cancer" is equal to 116 per cent approximately, the increase being noted from the very beginning of the statistics, viz., in 1868-9. 201 For many reasons it is preferable to combine the mortalities from "phthisis" and "other tubercular diseases." The combined mortalities compare thus:— MORTALITIES FROM ALL TUBERCULAR DISEASES. 1868-72. 1895-99. Mean 3.21 1.73 Maximum 3.30 1.82 Minimum 3.11 1.52 The reduction in the mortality during the second period was equal to 46 per cent. I am at the present time engaged on inquiries as to the prevalence in the Parish of "cancer," and the tubercular diseases, The foregoing figures show that there is a promise of a very useful investigation It is probable that the work will not be complete before the issue of the next census returns, and, indeed, there will be considerable advantage in delaying its issue until after that event. The Annual Reports of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and of the Water Examiner are not yet published, and I have, therefore, been unable to deal with the subjects of hospital work and water supply. I have in each report alluded to the inadequate office accommodation. I can only say that the same becomes each year less sufficient, and that the work of the Department suffers considerably in consequence. During the year, the only change in the Permanent Staff was the appointment of Mr. Mitchell to carry out the Registration of Houses let in lodgings. All the Members of the Staff have worked well during the year under review. 202 My thanks are due, and are heartily rendered, to my Medical Colleagues for the co-operation which they have at all times accorded to mo, on certain occasions at their own loss. I desire also to tendor my sincere thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Sanitary Committee for their readiness to adopt my recommendations, and for many personal kindnesses. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, ??? m.a., m.b., d.p.h., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, W. May, 1900. 203 POPULATION. The population of the whole Parish at the middle of the year 1899 was estimated at 129,124 persons, which figure was arrived at in the manner described in previous reports. The accuracy of the estimate is very doubtful, more so than was that of the estimate for 1898, as building operations have proceeded with an increasing rapidity during the past twelve or eighteen months. Much of the land north of Elgin Avenue has been taken for the erection of flats, as also has a considerable portion of the allotment gardens south of the Avenue. From a return prepared by the AssistantSurveyor in February, 1900, it appeared that 383 flats were then in occupation on the sites mentioned. In other parts of the Parish, many houses formerly occupied by single families are giving place to blocks of flats. On the whole there is good reason to believe that the estimate of the population of North Paddington (St. Mary's Sub-District) is somewhat considerably under-estimated, while that of South Paddington may be nearer the truth. The estimated total of 129,124 persons was made up of 95,730 residents of North Paddington, and 33,394 of South. The estimated numbers of males and females at the age-groups used in these Reports, 204 in the whole Parish and its two Sub-Districts,* will be found in Table 1. TABLE 1.

The Sub-Districts are not co-terminous with the Parliamentary Divisions of North and South Paddington, but the terms "North Paddington" or "St. Mary," and "South Paddington" or "St. John," have been used indifferently throughout the Report, and refer to the Registration Sub-Districts only. 205 The natural increment of the population during 1899, i.e., the excess of registered births over deaths, amounted to 878 persons, as compared with 935 in 1898, 1,210 in 1897, 1,126 in 1896, and 880 in 1895. The mean annual increment for the preceding decennium was 964. With a falling birth-rate, the natural increment will shrink unless the decrease in the death-rate be equal to, or in excess of, that of the birth-rate. The limit to the shrinkage of the former rate is unfortunately apparently not reached, but as regards the latter it is probable that much more shrinkage cannot be expected. As the reduction in the death-rate (plus immigration, here neglected) has hitherto largely neutralized the effects of the reduced birth-rate, it will be readily understood that the continuing decline in the birth-rate is not a matter which can be regarded with indifference. BIRTHS. During the fifty-two weeks of the registration year 1899, 2,940 births were recorded in the Parish, viz., 1,521 of boys and 1,419 of girls, equivalent to a rate of 22.76 per 1,000 persons of all ages. In North Paddington 2,555 births were registered (1,325 of boys and 1,230 of girls), equivalent to a rate of 26.68 per 1,000 inhabitants of the District. In South Paddington there were registered 385 births (196 of boys and 189 of girls), equivalent to a rate of 11.52. In Table 2 the figures for each quarter of 1899 are given, 206 TABLE 2.

Last year's birth-rate (22.76) was the lowest recorded in the eleven years, and was 0.4 below that for 1898 InSt. Mary, the births in 1899 (2,555) were 66 in excess of the average (2,489), but last year's total was exceeded in1896 (2,613), in1897 (2,586), in 1893 (2,567), and in 1898 (2,558).The birth rate for the Sub District (26.68) was 1.68 below the mean-rate 208 (28.36), and the lowest recorded in the eleven years. In South Paddington the 385 births registered were 78 below the average (463), and the smallest total on record, that for 1898 (407) being the next lowest. The birth-rate for the year (11.52) was 2.14 below the mean-rate (13.66), and the lowest on record for the period under review, the next lowest being that for 1898 (12.2). The birth-rate for England and Wales was 29.3 in 1899, as compared with a decennial mean of 30.3, last year's rate being the lowest for the eleven years. In London a rate of 29.4 was recorded, 1.3 less than the decennial mean (30.7), and 0.1 less than the rate for 1898. With a few exceptions the birth-rates not only of England and Wales, but of all European countries, have steadily fallen since the early '70's. An upward tendency has been noted here and there after a period of low rates, but on the whole, the birth-rate of the civilized world appears to be shrinking in a manner which may fairly cause some anxiety. Of the 2,940 children whose births were recorded in the Parish, 129 (73 boys and 56 girls) were illegitimate. The legitimate births were equivalent to a rate of 21.76 per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with a decennial mean of 23.18, a shrinkage of 1.42 or 6.3 per cent., and the illegitimate births to a rate of 0.99, 209 as against a mean rate of 1.08, a shrinkage of 0.09 per 1,000, or 8.4 per cent. For every 100 legitimate births recorded during the year, 4.6 illegitimate were registered, as compared with a decennial average of 4.7 (see Table 4). In North Paddington 123 TABLE 4.

It is unfortunate that the neglect of vaccination is on the increase in the Parish. Last year the total number of children not successfully vaccinated or otherwise satisfactorily accounted for, amounted to 14.7 per cent. of the children born, a percentage higher than that of any year since 1881, with the exception of 1891, when the percentage was 17.7 (see Table 5). The 75 "conscientious objectors" have been included among the "remaining, etc,." as they are unvaccinated TABLE 5. Vaccination Returns 1881-1898. Year. Births. Successfully vaccinated.

At the beginning of last year a Parliamentary Return was issued, which showed that there was an increase in the whole country in the amount of vaccination compared with the preceding year. The return included a number of places where vaccination, previously dead, had at the time of the return, become somewhat more active. If the ultimate issue of the Act of 1898 is to be the levelling down of the vaccination of the country to a middle point where the "pro-" and "anti-vaccinationists" may meet, the ultimate benefit to the community will be more than doubtful. The only remedy for the present condition of the law would appear to be to insist on re-vaccination, which should stand in the position of a new duty quite independent of any exemptions obtained under the Act of 1898. By such means it may be possible to neutralise in part the misguided and unhappy decisions of parents who are conscientious objectors. SICKNESS. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS D1SKASES. The cases of infectious disease reported during 1899 numbered 837 in all—65 more than the total for 1898 (772), 166 fewer than that for 1897 (1,003), and 389 fewer than that for 1896 (1,226).

In the Metropolis the notifications in 1899 (as compiled from the returns issued weekly by the Metropolitan Asylums Board) numbered 42,354, being 2,3 37 below the corrected average for the nine years, and equivalent to reduction of 5.3 per cent., or a little more than one-third of the reduction which occurred in the Parish. The local sickness-rate based on the notifications was 6.44 per 1,000 in 1899, as compared with rates of 6.04 and 7.94 in the two preceding years (see Table 6.) The Metropolitan rates were 9.31, 8.29, and 10.18 for the corresponding years—in each case over 2.0 per 1,000 higher than the local rate. In Paddington, the reported cases of erysipelas (146) and of enteric fever (97) were above their respective averages—the former to the extent of 5 cases, the latter, of 32. In the Metropolis, the cases of diphtheria (13,366) were 2,699 in excess of the average, those of enteric fever (4,463), 1,140 in excess, and those of puerperal fever (330), 46 in excess. The reduction in the prevalence of diphtheria* in Paddington was a very satisfactory feature of the year— 203 cases being reported, 72 less than the average; equivalent to a reduction of 26.2 per cent. In the Metropolis the cases of this disease were 23.4 per cent. • Throughout this Report, unless otherwise stated, membranous croup is considered to be identical with diphtheria. 214 TABLE 7.

The diminution in the proportion of cases of "membranous croup" to those of diphtheria, already commented on in earlier reports, was continued last year. The prevalence of infectious disease in the districts immediately adjacent to the Parish cannot fail to materially affect the spread of such diseases in the Parish itself. Table 7 supplies the necessary information for arriving at conclusions on this point. Smallpox, cholera, and typhus, and relapsing fevers, were practically non-prevalent in the districts included in the table. The fact (but not amount) of iucrease or decrease in prevalence of each of the diseases scheduled, in each district in 1899 as compared with 1898, is indicated in the following tabular statement:— Diphtheria Erysipelas.

No information is available on this point, except for the Parish, where the inquiries made during the year indicated with more or less probability that the infection had been imported in 67 instances, giving rise to 71 cases, the complete analysis being as follows:— Diphtheria 18 importations ; 18 cases.

These figures, although interesting, are not so instructive as the rates per 1,000 in each group. To economise space, only two age-groups have been used for this purpose (vide Table 9). In general terms the rates for all diseases were below the means, except those for erysipelas and enteric fever, With regard to the latter disease, the inci- TABLE 9.

At ages over 5 years, the increase amounted in each case to 0.3 per 1,000 for males and females in the whole Parish and in the Northern Sub-District, while in the Southern the rate for males was 0.2 in excess of the mean but that for females equal to the mean.

The 29 reported in the Metropolis constituted the smallest total for any year since notification has been in force. Nothing is at present known as to the proportion of the 29 cases erroneously diagnosed. From the experience of the preceding years, it may be taken as certain that the proportion was somewhat large.

In London, the 15 cases reported during the past year were 21 below the annual average number of cases, and, with the exception of the 13 cases reported in 1896, the smallest total for any year. The term "cholera" not being limited to the Asiatic disease, it is somewhat remarkable that so few attacks * All rates, except where otherwise indicated, are calculated per 1,000 persons of all ages. † "0.00" indicates a rate of less than 0.01. ‡ "0" indicates a corrected annual average of less than unity. 221 of any form should have been reported. The excessive heat of the summer gave rise, as will be set out hereafter, to a severe epidemic of diarrhœa and to an excess of enteric fever, and it might have been expected that there would have been a similar increase in the cases of "cholera." Diphtheria.* Paddington. London. Cases reported in 1899 203 13,705 Average annual number, 1890-98 275 11,181 Case-rate, 1899 156 3 00 It is satisfactory to be able to record the continued decrease in the prevalence of this disease, so far as concerns the Parish but the total for London (13,705) was only 115 below the total for 1896 when the maximum number of cases was recorded (13,820). The mean case rate for the Parish during the ten years 1890-99 was 2.04, the maximum rate (3.14) having been recorded in 1894, and the minimum (1.45) in 1891. Last year's rate was 24 per cent. below the mean for the ten years, while that of 1891 was 29 per cent. below, and that of 1894, 54 per cent. above. In North Paddington 181 cases were reported during the year, compared with an average of 239 —showing a reduction of 58 cases. The maximum number of cases for any year (340) was recorded in 1894, and the minimum (134) in 1892. In South Paddington 22 cases were recorded in 1899, compared * See note on page 213. 222 with an average of 36. In 1893 57 notifications of this disease were received from South Paddington, the maximum record for any year, last year's total being the minimum. In North Paddington the mean rate for the ten years was 2.41 per 1,000, the maximum rate recorded, that of 1894 (3.82), representing an exeess over the mean equal to 58 per cent., and the minimum, that of 1892 (1.55) a defect of 36 per cent. Last year's rate was 22 per cent. below the mean. In South Paddington the mean rate for the decennium (1890-99) was 1.08, the maximum rate of the period (1.74 in 1893) representing an excess over the mean equal to 61 per cent., and the minimum (0.66 in 1899), a defect from the mean equal to 39 per cent. The rates for males and females in the two Sub-Districts, compared with the means for the quinquennium 189498, will be found in Table 9, page 16. It will suffice here to say that all rates show satisfactory diminutions. So far the notifications have been dealt with as received, except that duplicate notifications have been excluded. An analysis of the enquiries made during the year, gives the following information:— St. Mary. St. John.

Last year in the same nine streets nearly one-half of the whole of the cases were reported. The streets in question, which include about one-tenth of the whole houses, are specified in the following statement, which compares the returns for 1899 with those of 1898 1898. 1899. Cases. Houses.

In the remainder of North Paddington, three or more cases were reported from— Adpar Street 4 cases in 2 houses. Bristol Mews 3 „ 1 house. Kensal Road 6 „ 3 houses. Kilburn Lane 3 „ 2 „ Oakington Road 3 „ 2 „ These streets contain (approximately) 230 houses, 10 of which furnished 19 cases. As might be expected with a diminished prevalence of the disease, there were fewer houses with more than a single case during the year. The 181 cases reported 224 during 1899 occurred in 157 houses, compared with 258 cases in 193 houses in 1898. One house in Adpar Street, from which three cases were reported during 1899, is composed of independent holdings, and the three cases were from three different holdings, each on a different floor. There was practically no doubt that there were three distinct infections. With regard to the other houses with more than a single case, it will suffice to say that in 8 eases the evidence pointed to direct transmission of infection from the first to the secondary cases; in 4, more than one case was notified simultaneously; that in 3 (including that already referred to) the cases subsequently reported were due to independent infections; that in 2 instances (5 cases in all) the return of a previous patient from hospital led to further infections; and that in one instance, the secondary case notified as diphtheria, proved subsequently to be scarlet fever. In South Paddington the 22 cases were reported from 21 houses, only one house (in Union Place) furnishing more, than one notification. In that case the second notification proved subsequently to be based The full particulars for the two years were— Houses with 1899. 1898. 1 case 140 167 2 cases 11 21 8 „ 5 2 4 1 2 5 - 1 225 on an erroneous diagnosis. The cases were reported singly from all streets, etc., except from Cambridge Place (2 cases, one being that of a nurse iu charge of a diphtheria patient at St Mary's Hospital), and Westbourne Terrace (2 cases). Of the 203 cases of diphtheria notified, 168 (equal to 82.7 per cent.) were removed to hospital, viz., 152 (or 83.9 per cent. of the notified cases) from North Paddington, and 16 (or 72.7 percent, of the notifications) from South Paddington. Of children under 5 years of age 59 (equal to 85.7 per cent. of cases notified) were sent to hospital from North Paddington, and 3 (equal to 100 per cent.) from South. In the whole Parish the children under 5 years of age sent away amounted to 84.9 per cent, of the notified cases at those ages, and those aged 5 years and upwards, to 81.6. The total percentages of removals of diphtheria cases in the years 1894-98 were 56.2, 53.0, 50.0, 60.8, and 64.3. There is good reason to think that the increased proportion of patients sent to hospital has had some influence in reducing the prevalence of the disease in the Parish. Scarlet fever. Paddington. London. Cases reported, 1899 382 18,113 Average annual number, 1890-98 482 22,594 Case-rate, 1899 2.95 3.98 Although the cases of this disease reported during the year were 79 in excess of the total for 226 1898 (303), there was still a satisfactory reduction from the average (482) of the nine years 1890-98, and the total was less than half that for 1896 (790), the year when the maximum number of cases was reported. Fewer cases were reported in 1890 (215), 1891 (263), 1894 (289), and 1898 (303), but in each of the other years the total was in excess of that for last year. In the Metropolis last year's total was 1,196 in excess of that for 1898, but 4,481 below the mean. In 1893 36,901 cases were reported ; in 1892, 27,095; 1896, 25,676; and in 1897, 22,876. The minimum record was that of 1891, 11,398 cases. In the whole Parish the case rate last year was 2.95 per 1,000 of all ages, as compared with a mean rate of 3.70 for the nine years 1890-98, showing a reduction of 25 per cent. The maximum rate, that of 1893 (6.44) was 118 per cent. in excess of that of last year, and the minimum, that of 1890 (1.81) 39 per cent. below. In North Paddington the case rate last year was 3.27 per 1,000, 28 per cent. below the mean rate (4.20), 122 percent, below the maximum rate (7.26) and 32 percent, above the minimum (2.23). In South Paddington, the rate was 2.06 per 1,000, 16 per cent. below the mean rate (2.39), 91 per cent. below the maximum (3.95), and 58 percent. above the minimum (0.87). The results of the usual inquiries 0 indicate that the cases notified may be grouped as follows:— 227 St. Mary. St. John. Imported cases, primary 15 9 „ secondary — - Return cases, primary 9 2 „ secondary 1 2 Errors in diagnosis 5 3 Remaining cases, primary 229 40 ,, secondary 54 13 In 1898 17 streets in North Paddington furnished more than three cases each, or 5 fewer than last year. From the 22 streets enumerated below, containing approximately 2,967 houses, 186 (out of the total 313) cases were reported from 133 houses. Cases. Houses. Cases. Houses.

There was an apparently excessive prevalence in the extreme north-western and northern parts of the district, as is manifested by the fact that 6 streets in that part, containing approximately 1,267 houses, furnished 85 cases (more than one-fourth of the whole) from 66 houses. The streets in question were:— Cases. Houses. Cases. House. Ashmore Road 17 13 Portnall Road 21 16 Bravington Rd. 19 14 Shirland Road 10 9 Kilburn Pk. Rd 5 4 Walterton Road 13 10 228 As already mentioned, there was some excess of diphtheria in these streets (vide p. 223). Consequent on the total increased prevalence of the disease, there was a tendency to multiple infection, the number of houses with more than one case each (48) being 19 in excess of the number for 1898. The analysis of the multiple infections in 1898 and 1899 is appended below:— Houses with 1897. 1898. 1 case 200 108 2 cases 86 20 3 ,, in 8 7 4 3 — 5 „ 1 — 6 „ — 1 8 „ — 1 Space will not allow of full details being set out for each house or family from which two or more cases were reported. An examination of a careful analysis leads to the conclusions that in 20 instances, the infection was transmitted direct from the first patient to the secondary cases; that in 13 instances two or more cases were simultaneously reported, either owing to the patients being taken ill at the same time or to the first case not being diagnosed until the occurrence of the subsequent attacks; that in 5 instances the subsequent cases occurred after the return of earlier patients from hospital; and that in 2 cases the secondary attacks occurred in children of a second family (in each instance just about one month subsequent to the first case). In one house, personal infection led to the 229 spread to a second family, and after that further cases occurred in the first, until 5 cases—spread over an interval of one month—had been reported. In another house, two cases were reported from the same family, with an interval of two months. Here it was ascertained that there had been cases of sore throat among other inhabitants of the house, which throats probably kept up a continuous personal infection. In two instances there was reason to doubt the sufficiency and efficiency of the disinfection carried out. In one family, where the first case was kept at home, a second occurred under circumstances very closely resembling those associated with "return" cases. There was no special incidence on any street in the Southern District, nor is it necessary to enumerate the streets in which more than three cases occurred, as it was in every case possible to account for such incidence. The 69 cases of scarlet fever were reported from 52 houses, the distribution being as follows:— Houses with 1899. 1898. 1 case 41 12 2 cases 7 6 3 „ 2 — 4 „ 2 2 Of the 11 instances in which more than one case were reported for a single family, in 7 the primary and secondary cases were reported simultaneously; 230 2 were due to personal infection; and 1 to the return of the earlier case from hospital. Of the 382 cases of scarlet fever reported in the Parish, 303 (equal to 71.6 per cent.) were removed to hospital, 262 from North Paddington (equal to 83.7 per cent. of the notified cases), and 41 from South (equal to 59.4 per cent.). Of the patients at ages under 5 years, 84.4 per cent. went to hospital from North Paddington and 46.1 from South. In the years 1894-98 the removals of patients of all ages from the whole Parish formed 82.3, 65.3, 76.8, 77.3, and 76.8, compared with 71.6 per cent. last year. Enteric Fever. Paddington. London. Cases reported, 1899 98 4,532 Average annual number, 1890-98 67 3,466 Case-rate, 1899 0.75 0.99 The notifications of this disease were 22 above the total for 1898, the previous maximum on record. In 1897 45 cases were recorded, the smallest total since the introduction of notification. The total for the Metropolis in 1899 (4,532) was the maximum since 1890, and 664 in excess of previous maximum (3,868 in 1893), the minimum record being 2,612 in 1892. As will be seen from Table 7, the increase in Paddington was pro rata higher than that which prevailed in any of the adjacent districts. * Cases of continued fever are deemed to be the same as enteric fever, and are included therewith. 231 From North Paddington 81 cases were reported, compared with an average of 52. That is the largest number on record, and was 18 in excess of the previous maximum (63) recorded in 1898, and 49 in excess of the minimum (32) recorded in 1892. In South Paddington 17 cases were reported last year, a number which has been exceeded four times, viz., in 1890 (23 cases), in 1894 (21 cases), and in 1892 and 1896 (18 cases in each year). The smallest total of any year was that of 1897, when 11 cases were recorded. The notifications of the whole Parish were last year equal to a rate of 0.75 per 1,000, compared with a mean rate of 0.52. Last year's rate was the highest of the series (10 years), was equivalent to a rise of 31 per cent. above the mean for the nine years, and was 47 per cent. higher than the lowest rate (0.35 recorded in 1897). In North Paddington the cases notified were equal to a rate of 0.85 per 1,000, 0.31 above the mean for the preceding nine years (an increase of 36 per cent.), and the highest on record. A minimal rate of 0.37 has been recorded twice, viz., in 1892 and 1897, in comparison with which last year's rate represents an increase of 57 per cent. In South Paddiugton, the case-rate was 0.51, 0.02 above the mean for the nine years 1890-98, and equivalent to an increase of only 2 per cent. The maximum rate (0.64) was recorded in 1894, and was 25 per cent. higher than the 232 rate of last year, while the minimum (0.33) recorded in 1897 was 36 per cent. lower The bulk of the increased prevalence recorded last year (whether measured by the absolute numbers or by the rates) fell on the Northern Sub-District. There is good reason to believe that the bacillus typhosus, the specific organism of enteric fever, can live and multiply in the soil under suitable conditions, and thence gain access to the human system. Admitting that and bearing in mind the effect which warmth has on the growth of the organism, the experience of last year, when there was a general absence of any evidence of epidemic outburst, but rather of sporadic and quasi-independent attacks not traceable to preceding cases, it becomes interesting to enquire whether there was any connec tion between increase of ground temperature and prevalence of the disease. The earth temperatures (at 3-ft. below the surface) as recorded at Greenwich have been taken out for the years 1895-98, as well as the weekly numbers of notification of enteric and continued fevers in Paddington and London. The results are summarised in Table 10, and although the figures therein set out, are based on a very limited period and the results of any causal relationship between the various data masked by errors of diagnosis, secondary infections, importations, &c., &c., there is sufficient evidence to indicate a possible relationship between the earth 233 TABLE 10.

A similar comparison has been instituted between the total notifications of enteric and continued fevers for London and Paddington. 234 temperatures and the notification (prevalence) of enteric fever. It may be mentioned here that the earth-temperature was much in excess of the mean for the four preceding years in July last and that there was an unusually early prevalence of enteric fever. Further there was during the fourth quarter a period of exceptionally high earth temperatures between periods of low, sufficient probably to account for the apparent discrepancy in the series. It is not suggested that increased earth temperature has been the only factor in producing last year's excess, but it is suggested that that increased temperature reacting on polluted soil has had some such effect. An analysis of the information obtained by the routine enquiries leads to a division of the notifiedcases into the following groups:— St. Mary. St John. Erroneous diagnosis 6 1 Imported cases 21 7 Remainder, Primary 43 7 „ Secondary 11 2 It should be mentioned here that many of the classes classed as "remainder, primary" were in persons who, though resident in the Parish, regularly took meals in other parts of London. In 6 out of the 98 cases reported, there were histories of consumption of oysters within the incubation period of the disease, and in 3 of other shell fish, such as mussels, cockles, &c. Four patients had been 235 engaged in nursing cases of enteric fever just before their illness, 5 had been pronounced to be ill with influenza immediately prior to the recognition of enteric fever, and in 3 instances preceding outbreaks of diarrhœa were reported in the households. The numbers of fresh attacks in each month are indicated below, the cases being all reported during the year 1899:— 1898. Dates of Attacks (Months). 1899. Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb Mar Apl My. Ju. Jy. Aug.

With the undermentioned exceptions, the cases were reported singly from the different streets, &c., of the Northern Sub-District:— Cases. Houses. Cases. Houses.

It will suffice to note that the only area in which the dates of attack indicated, any tendency to epidemicity, was that between Harrow Road and the Canal Basin. The cases were investigated with much care but no common factor could be discovered, except the climatic conditions and the neighbourhood of the dust wharves, pendant to these two being a great plague of flies. It is remarkable that the area in question had until the past autumn, enjoyed a comparative immunity from infectious disease. Many of the cases were on one 'milk walk', the carrier of which had some diarrhoea in the summer. The cases were however too few and too widely separated in point of time to permit of any suspicion of infection from that source. The possibility of direct infection from person to person is becoming more suspected as time goes on. The matter was briefly dealt with in the Report for 1898 (page 29). Last year 8 houses had more than a single case, compared with 6 in 1898, the cases being thus distributed:— Houses with 1899. 1898. One case 64 44 2 cases 7 2 3 „ 1 2 4 „ — 1 5 „ - 1 237 Owing to the interval which elapses between the dates of actual infection and of notification of cases, it is exceedingly difficult to get satisfactory explanations as to the origin of first infections or to trace the connection between the first and subsequent cases in any family. Two interesting cases were noted during the year, in which the personal element appeared very clear, (l) A man aged 23 was taken ill with enteric fever about July 23rd, and removed to St. Mary's Hospital on August 9th. During the interval the father attended on the patient who suffered from diarrhœa. On or about September 4th, the father sickened with the same disease to which he succumbed on the 22nd of that month. (2) On or about July 23rd, a woman aged 37 sickened with enteric fever. She had returned from Southend ten days previously after a visit of three days. She had some cockles whilst away. The woman was kept at home for treatment. At some date before she was completely recovered, the patient's husband re-occupied his place in bed and was reported ill with the disease in the following September, the date of onset being supposed to be about 11th of that month. There can be little doubt that the use of a w.c. in common to two or more families, occasionally leads to the spread of the disease, especially in its earlier stages. In South Paddington, the cases were reported singly from all streets,except Cambridge Place (2 nurses 238 at St. Mary's Hospital) and Westbourne Terrace (3 cases). In no instance was more than one case reported from any house. There was no evidence of epidemicity in any part of the District. The proportion of attacks in persons recently returned from the country or abroad was high, viz., 7 out of a total of 17 cases reported. Of the 98 cases reported, 70 (equal to 71.4 per cent.) were removed to hospital, 59 (72.8 per cent, of the notifications) from North and 11 (65.3 of the notifications) from South Paddington. Only two cases (in North Paddington) were children under 5 years, both of whom were sent to hospital. The percentage of cases removed, of all ages from whole parish, during 1894-98, were 51.1, 51.6, 37.1, 43.8, and 72.3 respectively. Puerperal Fever. Paddington. London. Cases reported, 1899 7 330 Average annual number, 1890-98 8 284 Case-rate, 1899 0.05 0.07 The 7 cases reported in 1899 were one below the average, but 2 in excess of the total for 1898, all the cases being reported from North Paddington. No case has been reported from the Southern District for the past five years. The case rate for the whole Parish was 0.05 per 1,000 persons of all ages, a rate slightly below the mean for the nine preceding years (0.06). 239 As regards North Paddington, the 7 cases were equal to a rate of 0.07 per 1,000 persons of all ages, or more correctly to one of 0.1 per 1,000 females. The frequency of the disease in reference to the births was 2.7 per 1,000. In the ten years 1890-99,25,093 births have been registered in the Sub-District, and 72 cases of puerperal fever reported, giving a frequency of 2.8 per 1,000 births. In South Paddington 4,501 births were registered in the same period and 4 cases (3 in 1893 and 1 in 1894) reported, equal to a frequency of 0.6 per 1,000 births. In the Metropolis 133,120 births were registered in 1899, and the 330 cases of puerperal fever were equal to a frequency of 2.4 per 1,000 births. The exact interpretation of the term "puerperal fever" has been a subject of discussion since the introduction of notification in 1890. There is 110 doubt that the term as commonly used includes not one but many diseases, so much so that the last edition of the "Nomenclature of Diseases" recommended that the term should be abandoned and the disease more correctly described according to the phenomena presented. The difficulty experienced in defining the term has resulted in neglect to notify many cases which were intended to be reported. The only argument which could justify such neglect has now been put out of court by the official opinions given at the beginning of the year by the Royal College of 240 Physicians of London and the Obstetrical Society. Briefly put, the opinions were to the effect that "puerperal fever" included "septicaemia, pysemia, septic peritonitis, septic metritis, and other septic inflammations in the pelvis occurring as a direct result of child-birth." The prevalence of puerperal fever cannot be considered without taking into account the character of the attendance available for the patients at their labour. The question of registration and certification of midwives has been the subject of much discussion and is not without some bearing on public health work. Last year's cases can be divided into 2 groups, one containing 4 patients delivered and attended by mid wives and nurses connected with Queen Charlotte's Hospital, and the other 3, delivered by medical practitioners and attended by untrained women. No information is available as to the proportions of births attended by medical practitioners and by midwives, so that no conclusions can be drawn from this division. Of the 4 cases occurring in connection with the Queen Charlotte Maternity, two were due to a septic case in Kensington not diagnosed at the date of the labours in this Parish, and one was a woman who had in bed with her at the time of her confinement a child with a discharging sore (hip disease). The fourth case could not be explained except on the basis that it was due to drain effluvia, the woman 241 being confined in a room over a w.c. which was subsequently found to be very defective. The cases in the other group could not be so satisfactorily explained. Three of the patients resided in houses where the sanitary condition was bad, three others in houses where the condition was unsatisfactory, and one where the general condition was distinctly good, but where there was a defective mica flap in front of the bedroom window—the flap being always open. Indeed it appeared that in every case, independently of the special sources of infection already mentioned, there was evidence that drain emanations could and probably did get access to the lying-in room. Typhus Fever. Paddingtou. r ondon. Cases reported, 1899 1 14 Annual average number, 1890-98 .. 0 19 Ca:>e-rafce, 18y'J 000 ... 000 For the second time since 1890, a case of typhus fever was reported last year. The patient resided in South Paddington and was a woman of mature age, caretaker of an empty house of good class. The notification was sent in under much reservation and subsequent consultations negatived the first diagnosis. The patient ultimately died and the cause of death was certified to be purpura hemorrhagica. The symptoms were not inconsistent with severe ptomaine poisoning, but no source of poisoning could be found. 242 Shortly after this case was reported (at end of July) a second case of illness was brought to the knowledge of the Department, which the medical attendant suspected to be typhus fever. A consultation took place and the existence of that disease was negatived, while a post mortem examination, together with a consideration of the facts of the illness gathered after death, led to a final diagnosis (chiefly by exclusion) of death from ptomaine poisoning. At the inquest the finding was to that effect. As regards the Metropolis as a whole, the disease still continues to occur in isolated cases. In 1890, 35 cases were reported, and in 1897 only 4. The recent outbreaks have not been satisfactorily traced to previous centres of infection, although such continue to persist in extra-metropolitan areas. Erysipelas. Paddington. London. Cases reported, 1899 146 5,615 Annual average number, 1890-98 141 6,411 Case-rate, 1899 113 1.23 It is very difficult to determine the value to be attached to notification of this disease, if it can always be so termed. The cases reported last year (146) constituted the second largest number for any year, the total for 1893 (242) being the only one in excess. In North Paddington 125 cases were reported last year, 3 more than the average. The maximum total 243 for any year was that for 1893, 206, and the minimum that for 1890, 79. In South Paddington 21 cases were reported in 1899, compared with an annual average of 19. In 1893 the maximum number (36) was reported, and in 1891, the minimum (9). In North Paddington two notifications were received during the year from each of 6 houses, and three from 2 other houses. In one of the two last instances, the mother was first ill and the disease was subsequently communicated to her two sons, 8 and 10 days later respectively. In the other case, three notifications were received during the year with respect to one woman, aged 77, who had attacks in January, February, and August. With respect to the houses whence 2 cases were reported, in 2 the notifications dealt with the same patients, in 2 others, the attacks were in independent families at considerable intervals and were doubtless quite unconnected; in one case the second attack was evidently contracted from the first; and in the last, one of the two cases notified could not be traced or identified at all. Return Casks. In 9 instances the return of a patient from hospital after isolation for scarlet fever was followed by the sickening of other members of the family. There were 5 similar instances after diphtheria. Particulars of certain of these cases are recorded in tabular form in 244 Appendix B, at the end of this Report. Except two cases, specially indicated, the recurrence of infection was carefully investigated in respect of all circumstances and details likely to favour the spread of infection independently of the home coming patient. For the sake of brevity, only those points which were specially noted in each case have been tabulated. There were no grounds for thinking that the new cases were due to defective disinfection, etc. In the current year these cases will be further investigated with the aid of bacteriology. In addition to the 10 instances tabulated, there were two others which until investigated appeared to furnish return cases. In the first of these cases, patient A (m. æt. 4) came home after treatment for diphtheria, on 10th April, and his sister (patient B,æt. 11) was notified ill with the same disease, she sickening on the 15th of that month. The diagnosis of B's case was not confirmed at the hospital. A bacteriological examination showed that the "pseudo-diphtheritic" bacillus was present in A's throat after he had been home some 16 days. There were no other cases of illness in the house or street. For the second case, the patient who was taken ill after the return home of her brother and certified to be ill with diphtheria, for which disease the boy had been sent to hospital, was found to be ill with scarlet fever. In connection with the occurrence of these 'return' cases, it ought to be mentioned that endeavours have 245 been made to obtain systematic information as to the dates of discharge of patients from hospital. There can be little doubt that with the existing insufficient knowledge of the subject, some supervision over patients immediately after their return home, would prove beneficial. Moreover it may be expected that a systematic record of the circumstances attending the home-coming of patients, both when return cases cropped up and otherwise, would tend to elucidate the causes of such return cases and indicate the means by which their occurrence may be prevented. The views of the Asylums Board on the subject can be best stated by the following excerpt from a report of the Special and Medical Sub-Committee, to which the matter was referred for consideration : — This subject is not new to the Board. It was considered by them in May last year, when the Ambulance Committee reported fully upon similar suggestions received from the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, and again as recently as July last year, when the same Committee dealt with correspondence which had passed between the then South-Western Hospital Committee and the medical officer of health for the Strand district. As the result of their consideration the Board did not see their way to furnish the information asked for, the following being the reasons set forth by the Ambulance Committee in their report of May, 1898, above referred to, viz. :— "In support of the proposal that medical officers of "health should be informed of the discharge of patients from "the Board's hospitals, the writer of the letter states that it "is thought that much advantage would ensue by enabling 246 "some supervision to be kept over patients when returned "to their homes, and so lessening the liability to the "so-called 'return' cases, especially in the case of those " who have to be sent home with nasal or other discharges. "During the year 1897 there were no fewer than "20,897 patients discharged from the Board's fever hospitals. "To acquaint the medical officers of health with the names "and addresses of all the patients returned to their respective "sanitary districts would obviously involve a large amount "of clerical labour. The additional expenditure which "would consequently be incurred would not, however, deter "us from recommending the Board to furnish the informa"tion required if we were convinced of its usefulness; but "we are very doubtful if it would enable the sanitary "officials to exercise any supervision over the patients in "their homes, or even if it did so, that the liability to the "so-called return cases would be lessened thereby, seeing "that no patient is discharged until the medical superin"tendent of the hospital is of opinion that the patient may "leave without risk of communicating infection or contagion, "and that if the patient suffered from nasal or any other "discharge it would be such as in the medical superintendent's "opinion was non-infectious. "We are therefore not prepared to recommend the " Board to accede to this proposition." In the Report for 1898 mention was made of the inquiry into the circumstances attending return cases then being made by Professor Simpson on behalf of the Asylums Board. Professor Simpson's report has been before the Board for some months but has not yet been issued. 247 Internotification. As in former years, whenever there was reason t suspect that any person, certified to be ill with an infectious disease, had contracted that disease outside the Parish, a communication was addressed to the medical officer of health of the district in question. In one instance the inquiries made traced the spread of infection from a patient A from another metropolitan area, through an outbreak in a country district, to a patient B residing in Paddington but at the time of infection in the country. Special Cases of Infectious Disease. The following brief notes of certain out-breaks during the year may be of interest. I.—A. S., m. 36 years, was notified ill with enteric fever June 23rd, and removed to hospital that day. He was reported to have sickened on the 16th of that month. He died on the 26th. On inquiry it was ascertained that his wife had been ill in the previous month, for an indeterminate period, and that she had had congestion of the lung's afterwards, a fact suggestive of an attack of enteric fever, but that disease was not diagnosed. Mrs. S. while ill was nursed by Mrs. R. a resident in Kensington and visited frequently by Mrs. W. resident in Paddington. Mrs. S. after the death of her husband returned to her parents' home in Kensington. In the course of July there were 8 248 cases of enteric fever among the relations of Mrs. S. residing in Kensington ; Mrs. W. (already mentioned), residing in Paddington, contracted the disease and died ; and two other fatal cases occurring in the Parish at the commencement of August, were suspected to have been infected from the same source. The direct transference of infection from patient to patient appeared to be chiefly operative in this outbreak. II.—On May 11th, A. S., m. 34 years, was reported ill with diphtheria. It was found that his daughter (J. S., 4 years) had died on the 10th, the history clearly indicating unrecognised diphtheria. On 12th a son (F. S., aged 1 year) was certified ill with the same disease. Swabs taken from the throats of the two other members of the family, viz. : J. S. (f. 27 years) and J. H. S. (m. 3 years) yielded cultures of the bacillus of diphtheria. The former patient remained quite well, but the latter sickened and was removed to hospital on the 17th. There were no other cases in the house or neighbourhood. No source could be located for the infection of the first (fatal) case. III.—On August 8th, A. N. (m. 4 years) was notified ill with diphtheria. The boy's father being anxious to go to the country and take his daughter with him, called at the Vestry Hall to get the consent of the Sanitary Authority. Consent was declined except on proof that the throats of the persons 249 tioned were free from the bacilli of diphtheria. On the 9th, swabs were taken from the father (J. N.) and daughter (R. N.). From the former no culture was obtained, from the latter the bacillus was isolated. Antiseptic gargles, etc., were ordered, and the child kept apart. A further swab taken on the 17th gave no culture. It is probable that had R. N. gone awry immediately after the 9th, she would have given rise to an outbreak at the place visited by her, even if she did not herself become actively infected. In a number of families cases of diphtheria and scarlet fever have been reported during the year at such short intervals as to suggest erroneous diagnosis in respect of one or the other disease. Enquiries have, however, made it evident that there were no such errors, and the occurrence of such double infection is now a matter for special investigation. School Attendance. It is almost impossible to measure at all accurately the extent to which school attendance favours the spread of infection. That it does so, is practically demonstrated by the rule (which is not, however, without exception) that fewer cases of infectious disease are reported during the vacations. In the appended tabular statement, an attempt has been made to set out the relative frequency of infectious illness among families sending children to the public 250 TABLE 11. Scholars Attending.

All cases which were due to imported infection, or to return home of discharged patients, as well as those which were erroneously diagnosed or were secondary attacks, have been excluded; so that the cases here included were all 251 primary, for which no adequate source of infection could be located. The cases scheduled as "scholars" were those of children in actual attendance at, or before, their illness, while the patients scheduled under "patients not scholars" were persons who did not themselves go to school, but were members of families sending children to school.* The cases reported "from outside" cannot be similarly distinguished, as the information obtained only states that children from a given infected house attend the specified school. Among children in attendance at school, there were 56 primary attacks of scarlet fever in Board schools, and 74 in "other schools," the cases of diphtheria being 27 and 44 respectively. Approximately 3.3 children attend "other schools" to 1 attending Board school, showing that, as in former years, there was, a greater prevalence among the latter than the former children. No recent statistics as to average No recent statistics as to average attendances are available, but taking those collected some 3 or 4 years ago, the following rates have been obtained :— Frequencies per 1,000 Attendances. Diphtheria. Scarlet Fever.  Board Schools 1899 8.6 17.9 1898 8.3 10.5 Other Schools 1899 4.3 7.8 1898 2.5 5.0 * Where more than one school is attended by the children of the family, the case has been excluded from this list. 252 These figures suggest that there was a considerable increase in the cases of diphtheria among children attending "other schools," which on examination appears to have been confined to three schools—St. Augustine, St. Luke, Fernhead Road, and High School, Saltram Crescent. At these schools 20 cases were noted in 1899, compared with 7 in 1898, while the total increase during the year for all schools amounted to only 18 cases. Among the children at the Harrow Road Board School, 35 cases of scarlet fever and 19 of diphtheria were reported in 1899, compared with 33 and 26 in 1898. The foregoing figures relate exclusively to schools situated in the Parish. On examining the attendances of all patients of school age, it is found that of patients attacked with scarlet fever 167 were scholars at schools in Paddington and 23 at schools over the border; and that for those ill with diphtheria the corresponding figures were 74 and 25 respectively. It will also be noted that there was a greater diphtheria prevalence in the local schools close to the borders of the Parish, viz., Harrow Road Board, St. Augustine's Church, St. Luke's Church, and the High School, Saltram Crescent. These schools are all situated within the limits of the area of greater prevalence mentioned on p. 223 of this Report. 253 The cases of infectious disease reported from adjacent Parishes in connection with the local schools, comprised 80 in all, viz. :— Diphtheria.

DEATHS. During the year 2,205 deaths (1,062 of males and 1,143 of females) were registered in the Parish, equivalent to an uncorrected death-rate of 17.27 per 1,000 of the total population, compared with a rate of 17.12 in 1898, and a mean rate of 16.63 for the quinquennium 1894-1898. The deaths registered included 179 from the principal zymotic diseases, viz., 115 from diarrhœa, 44 from whooping cough, 9 from diphtheria, 8 from enteric fever, and 3 from scarlet fever ; 141 from phthisis ; 419 from bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy; and 140 from accidents and other forms of violence. Of the deceased persons, 466 were aged under 1 year (equivalent to 158 per 1,000 births registered), 188 aged from 1-5 years, 254 and 593 aged 65 years and upwards. In 1898, the uncorrected infantile mortality was at the rate of 169 per 1,000 births, 11 higher than last year. In 1898, 133 deaths were recorded locally from cancer, and 270 from all forms of tubercular disease. Last year the corresponding totals were 162 and 210 respectively. The foregoing figures take no account of the 155 deaths of parishioners registered in the Metropolitan Area but beyond the Parish boundaries, and moreover include 298 deaths of persons who were non-parishioners. By inclusion of the former and exclusion of the latter deaths a nett total of 2,062 deaths for the year is obtained, equivalent to a rate of 15.96 per 1,000 of all ages. As will be explained hereafter, this rate requires correction—although commonly known as the "corrected" death-rate—before it can be properly compared with the rates of other districts. Of the 2,062 deaths of parishioners, 9 75 were of males and 1,087 of females, equivalent to rates of 18.23 and 14.36 per 1,000 living of each sex (Table 12). In North Paddington there were 1,709 deaths, 800 of males and 909 of females, the corresponding rates being 17.85, 19.24, and 16.78 respectively. In South Paddington the 353 deaths recorded were equal to a rate of 10.57 per 1,000 persons, whilst the deaths of males (175) and of females (178) were equivalent to rates of 14.71 and 8.27 per 1,000 of each sex. 255 TABLE 12.

In St. Mary (North Paddington), last year's rate (17.85) was 0.10 above the mean (17.75), and in St. John (rate 1899, 10.57), 1.97 below the mean (12.54), and the lowest recorded.* The death-rate for the whole Country in 1899, as calculated by the Registrar-General from * The rates given in Table 13 must be accepted with much reservation, as the estimates of the populations will probably require to be considerably corrected when the next Census has been taken. 256 TABLE 13.

(See also Table 17, p. 264 ) 257 So far no allowance has been made for the influence on the death-rate of the sex-age composition of the population. In Table 14 the observed rates for the districts therein mentioned have been corrected by the use of factors which allow for the varying proportions of persons at different ages of the two sexes, and the fully corrected rates in the third column, may for present purposes, be deemed strictly comparable. Of the areas included in that Table, Hampstead had the lowest death-rate (13.35), the next in succession being those of St. George, Hanover Square (15.68), Wandsworth (16.34), and Paddington (17.39). St. George-in-the-East (28.15) and Newington (25.08) had the highest rates for the year. In Tables 15 and 15a (pages 58 and 59) the deathrates from all causes prevailing in seven age-groups of each sex have been calculated, and set out in comparison with the rates for each of the years 1894-98, and with the mean rates for the period. In each sub-division the rate at ages "0-1" was lower than the mean, and generally lower than the corresponding rate fur any of the years 1894-98. The decreased mortality indicated by these figures among females in St. John's Sub-District is very striking. At ages "1 to 5," and "5 to 15," reductions from the mean were recorded, some of them very considerable ; at "15 to 25 " the rates for males were above 258 TABLE 14.

The " All Ages " rates were below the corresponding mean-rates, except those for females in North Paddington and Paddington. The general indications of these tables are a slightly increased mortality, as compared with the means for the preceding quinquennium, among females, and a much heavier incidence of death on elderly people. On the whole, last year's rates (all causes) compare well with those for any of the years 1894-98. The rates as ages "0 to 1" given in these tables are based on estimates of the numbers living in the population, as indicated by the census returns. Calculated on the more reliable basis of births registered during the year, the infantile mortality for the whole Parish, both sexes, was 151 per 1,000 births registered, a rate 10 below that of 1898, and 2 above that of 1897 (see Table 14). Of the districts included in the "Western Areas" of London, St. George, Hanover Square, had the lowest rate (129), that of Paddington coming next.

In Willesden the rate was 159 per 1,000 births registered. The subject will be dealt with in more detail later on. CAUSES OF DEATH. The numbers of deaths of parishioners of each sex are set out in Table III. of the Appendix, which table is the basis of all others dealing with this part of the subject. The rates given in Table 16 have been obtained by summing up the elements in Table III. Table 16 can only indicate the variations in mortality in a very loose way, as each group includes diseases, the prevalence of each of which varies considerably and independently in successive years. The rates given indicate a reduction in the prevalence of Zymotic Diseases (except Diarrhoeal and Septic), and an increase in that of the Local Diseases, chiefly those of the Circulatory, Respiratory, and Urinary Systems. This agrees with the fact already noted, that there was a heavier mortality than usual at the later ages of life. In Table 17, a comparison has been attempted between the rates of mortality from all, and certain / selected causes in the Parish, Metropolis, and Country generally, both last year and some years before. The table is incomplete in that no correction has been possible for age and sex — factors of exceeding importance for the diseases mentioned. Taking the figures 263 TABLE 16.

All other rates are based on the published returns of the Registrar-General. † The rates here given do not agree with those mentioned elsewhere, being based on totals of 2,065 deaths from all causes, and 198 from the zymotic diseases mentioned, as compared with a corrected total of 2,062, 203 obtained by the Department. 265 as they stand, the local rates compare well with any of those of the other areas mentioned. The rates for St. John are very much below those for "Rest of England and Wales," which represents Rural England. A total death-rate of 10.6 per 1,000 of all ages is one which would be a cause of much self laudation and advertising in a "health resort."* The Zymotic Death-Rate for the Parish (1.55) was 0.54 below the mean rate (2.09), and the lowest rate since 1891 when it was 1.70. The lowest rate recorded in the eleven years was that of 1889 (1.39). In North Paddington last year's rate was 2.00, 0.48 below the mean. Lower rates were recorded in 1891 (1.86), and 1889 (1.76), but those of all other years since 1889 were higher than that of last. In South Paddington, last year's rate 0.32 was 0.75 below the mean (1.07) and the lowest recorded since 1889. The foregoing rates being the resultant effects of varying prevalence of different diseases, some of which are subject to administrative control, others not, it will be well to consider the more important diseases singly. Small Pox. There has been no death from this disease in the Parish since 1896, or perhaps more correctly since * Too much importance should not be attached to these death-rates owing to the uncertainty as to the correctness of the estimated population. 266 TABLE 18.

Mortality† „ 0.03; „ 069; „ 0.01 "That 1899 was a non-epidemic year," sums up the history of the disease so far as the Parish was concerned. The efforts made in 1898 to exercise some control over its prevalence were continued. From the schools 52 cases were reported, on which basis the 4 deaths recorded during the year would be equivalent to a fatality rate of 7.7 per cent. Such a rate indicates a malignancy which is unsupported by collateral evidence, and hence it must be concluded that the information received was very incomplete, a result which was expected. There will always be a tendency to ignore the existence of the few cases which occur in non-epidemic periods. It is, however, by dealing with such cases that the best results in preventing epidemics are to be obtained. The death-rate from this disease (0.03 per 1,000) was the lowest recorded since 1889, with the exception of that for 1897 (0.01), and was 036 below the decennial mean. As 1899 was a non-epidemic year, it will be more satisfactory to compare its rate with the mean for the non-epidemic years included in the decennium 1889-98. There were 5 such years, with a * "Fatulity" represents the number of deaths per 100 cases of the disease recorded. † "Mortality," the death-rate per 1,000 persons of all ages. 269 mean rate of 0.11, compared with a mean of 0.67 for the 5 epidemic years. In North Paddington, where all the deaths occurred, last year's death-rate was 0.04, compared with a decennial mean of 0.49 — or 0.15 for the non-epidemic years. In South Paddington, the mean rate for the whole decennium was 0.13, and 0.00 for the non-epidemic years. According to the Registrar-General's figures the death-rate in the Parish from measles was 0.05 per 1,000—the lowest recorded in any of the districts immediately contiguous to the Parish. The appended rates indicate the immunity apparently enjoyed by Paddington. Measles. Death-rates per 1,000 persons of all ages.

In North Paddington the mortality rate (0.44) was similarly below and above the mean rates, while in South there was a very satisfactory decline in comparison with all the means.

The death-rate last year (0.22) was less than half the mean rate for the deceunium (0.47), and below the mean rate for the two quinquennia (0.40 and 0.54 for the first and second respectively). So low a mortality rate has not been recorded since 1889, that for 1891 (0.23) and that for 1892 (0.28) being the only rates below 0.30 per 1,000. The deaths actually recorded 272 (29) were much below the corrected averages, viz., 60 for the decennium, 51 for the first quinquennium, and 70 for the second. In North Paddington the mortality rate was 0.30 last year, compared with mean rates of 0.54, 0.43, and 0.06 for the decennium, first and second quinquennium respectively, while the 29 deaths were much below the corresponding corrected averages, viz., 52, 41, and 63. In South Paddington, the mortality rate was zero, compared with means of 0.27, 0.33, and 0.22 for the decennium, and the two quinquennia. The corrected average annual numbers of deaths were 8, 10, and 7 respectively, while there was no death during last year. In Table 19, the death-rates prevailing at various ages for each sex are set out. Last year's rates compare particularly favourably with the means for the quinquennium.

Two may be mentioned—(a) milder character of the attacks, either due to a weaker virulence of the organism or to a higher power of resistance on the part of the patients from climatic causes, improved sanitary surroundings, etc.; and (b) more successful treatment, foremost being that by antitoxin. Further discussion should be held over until the experience of later years makes it clear whether the reduction noted be one of chance or of cause and effect. 275 "Fever."* Cases reported 1899, 98; 1898, 76; 1897, 45 Deaths „ 10; „ 17; 7 Fatality „ 102; „ 22.6; „ 15.5 Mortality „ 0.08; „ 0.13; „ 0.05 Although more cases of enteric fever were reported during the last year than in 1898, the deaths were fewer, and the fatality less than one half, being the lowest for any of the three years tabulated above. The mortality rate for the Parish (0.08) was one third less than the mean rates for the decennium and two quinquennia (in this case the three being the same, viz. 0.12). In North Paddington the mortality was 0.09, a figure a little under the mean rates, viz. 0.11 for the decennium and 0.10 and 0.12 for the first and second quinquennia respectively, while in South Paddington last year's rate (0.03) was only a fraction of the mean-rates 0.15, 0.16 and 0.13 for the corresponding periods. The deaths recorded during the year compare equally favourably with the corrected averages. (See Table 18.) Last year's rate for the whole Parish (0.08) was below the rate for any year since 1889, except that of 1892 and 1897, when it was 0.06 on each occasion. In North Paddington rates below that for last year (0.09) were recorded in 1890 (0.06), 1892 (0.08), and * Locally this means enteric fever, elsewhere a few deaths from other forms of fever may be included. 276 1897 (0.05), while in South Paddington last years rate was by far the lowest of any for the eleven years 1889—98.

In the Parish the corrected average for the decennium (79) was 31 below the number of deaths recorded last year (110), while the averages for the first and second quinquennia were 74 and 84 respectively. On the other hand in St. John's Sub-District, 8 deaths were returned during the year under this head, equal to the average for the quinquennium 1889-93, 2 below that for the quinquennium 1894-98 (10), and one below that for the decennium (9). The significance of this disease as a cause of death, is not the same at all ages of life, and, as will be presently shown, the increased mortality from this cause at the younger ages, as shown by deaths from 'diarrhœa,' does not reveal the whole case. (See under "Infantile Mortality.") The death-rate from diarrhœa was 0.85 per 1,000 of all ages last year for the whole Parish, compared with a mean of 0.60 for the decennium, and of 0.56 and 0.64 for the first and second quinquennia. In North Paddington, last year's rate was 1.07, compared with means of 0.73, 0.69, and 0.77 for the 278 decennium and two quinquennia respectively, while in South Paddington, last year's rate (0.23) was below all the mean rates (0.26, 0.24, and 0.29). Last year's rates for Paddington and St. Mary were the highest recorded since 1889. In St. John, lower rates than that of last year (0.23) were recorded in 1889, (0.16), 1891 (0.21), and 1894 (0.06). The prevalence of this disease is largely influenced by the temperatures of the air and soil—which become operative chiefly through uncleanly conditions. Having regard to the heat of last summer a high infantile mortality from diarrhœa may be said to be almost inevitable, but it is a matter for regret, that the mortality should have been so much higher in Paddington than in any of the surrounding districts, Willesden excepted. Diarrhœa. Rate per 1,000 persons of all ages. Kensington 0.69 St. Marylebone 0.72 Chelsea 0.66 Hampstead 0.44 St. George, Hanover Square 0.86 Willesden 1.58 Paddington 0.83 (0.85). These rates would be more instructive, were it possible to separate the deaths of very young children from those at older ages, but the data necessary are not available. 279 The foregoing constitute the Principal Zymotic Diseases, and it is customary to state the "Zymotic Death-rate" due to them. The value of such a rate, except as a most crude and popular measure of the sanitary condition of the district, is a matter for much doubt. The death-rate caused by these diseases last year amounted to 1.57 in the Parish as a whole, compared with corresponding rates of 2.58, 1.93, and 2.47 in 1896, 1897, and 1898, and a mean of 2.09 for the decennium 1889-98. In North Paddington the zymotic rate was 2.00, and the decennial mean rate 2.48, and in South Paddington the corresponding rates were 0.32, and 1.07 respectively. The diseases included in the group fall naturally into two classes, viz.:—those which are included in the schedule for notification and those not so included. The former (including smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria and "fever,") may for convenience of reference be styled "controlled," the latter (including measles, whooping cough, and diarrhœa) as "uncontrolled,' diseases. In the former case, notification, enforced isolation, disinfection, etc., are employed to limit the spread of infection, in the latter, little is done outside the region of general sanitation.* The death rate from the "controlled" group was 0.34 last year, compared * With regard to measles, the efforts at control made locally, are too incomplete to have exercised much influence at the present time. There is little doubt that some benefit has accrued, but not equal to that elfiected in the first group, 280 with a decennial mean-rate of 0.72; that from the latter 1.21, compared with a mean of 1.37. The complete comparison is given below.— Death-rates from groups of diseases, per 1,000 persons of all ages. Paddington. St. Mary.

It is noteworthy that while Paddington had last year a lower rate from 'controlled' diseases than that prevailing in any of the contiguous districts except Hampstead, the local rate from the 'uncontrolled' diseases was fifth in magnitude, the disproportion being due to the mortalities from whooping cough and diarrhoea.

The deaths returned during the year as due to puerperal fever numbered 5, all from North Paddington. The corrected average for the decennium was also 5, including one death to St. John's District where no fatal case was recorded last year. The mortality calculated per 1,000 persons of all ages was 0.04, a trifle above the decennial mean rate (0 03). In North Paddington, the mortality was 0.05, and the decennial mean rate 0.04. In South Paddington the decennial mean rate was 0.02. In considering the subject of fatality of childbirth it is desirable to add to the deaths certified as due to puerperal fever those which are classed under "Diseases of Parturition." The combined total for the past year was 7, compared with averages of 13, 13, and 12 for the decennium and first and second quinquennia. All the deaths from these causes during last year occurred among residents in North Paddington, the total (7) being below each of the corresponding averages—10, 11, and 10. In South Paddington the averages were 3,2, and 2. There was, therefore, some diminution in the mortality during the year. 282 In the ten years 1889-98, 29,517 births were registered, 24,884 in North Paddington, and 4,633 in South Paddington. The deaths from ''puerperal fever" and "diseases of parturition" in the three Districts during the same period numbered 131, 107, and 24 respectively. The maternal mortality was therefore at the rate (per 1,000 births) of 4.43 in the Parish, 4.39 in North, and 5.17 in South Paddington. Last year the mortalities (on the same basis) were 2.38, 2.73, and nil respectively. Last year was the first occasion (since 1889) of no death being ascribed to causes connected with parturition, in either of the two divisions of the Parish. Cancer. During the year 153 deaths were certified as due to this cause, or more correctly speaking, to the effects of the various forms of malignant neoplasmata commonly spoken of as, and denominated, "cancer." The 153 deaths were 40 in excess of the corrected annual average for the decennium (113), 43 in excess of that for the quinquennium 1889-93 (110), and 36 in excess of that for 1894-98 (117). In North Paddington 113 deaths were classed under this head, 30 in excess of the decennial average (83), and 34 and 27 in excess of averages for the first and second quinquennia respectively. In South Paddington 40 deaths were recorded last year, being 10 in excess of the decennial average, and 9 in excess of the averages for both quinquennia. 283 The mortality from this cause last year was 1.18 per 1,000 of all persons in Paddington and St. Mary's District, and 1.19 in St. John's District.

It is impossible to say in what proportion of cases the site so mentioned is the original or the secondary seat of the disease. It will be of little profit to discuss on the present occasion the particulars given in Table 20 as it is confined to a single year. Such discussion may be more usefully deferred until the inquiry as to the increase in prevalence of "cancer" (now in course of prosecution) shall be complete. As part of that inquiry the comparisons between the annual average numbers of deaths registered in each of the two four year periods, 1891-94 and 1895-98, and those registered in 1899 may be of interest. This table suggests that in North Paddington there has 284 TABLE 20. Deaths from "Cancer" in 1899. Classified according to situation. 1899. St. Mary. St. John. C. O. C. O. M. F. M. F. M. F. M. F. 1.

In South Paddington an increase is similarly suggested, but not to so marked an extent. It has not been possible up to the time of writing to calculate the sex-age death rates, the only reliable standards. Tuberculosis. The deaths from this cause include those attributed to "phthisis," "hæmoptysis," "hydrocephalus," "tubercular meningitis," "tabes mesenterica," "scrofula," etc. The grand total from all these causes for last year was 197. The custom of divorcing the deaths due to "phthisis" (consumption), from those due to "other forms of tuberculosis" is too firmly rooted to be departed from, but it is highly probable that such custom is not in accordance with true pathology or aetiology. The deaths from phthisis in 1899 (142) were well below the corrected averages, viz., 168 for the decennium, 180 for the first quinquennium, and 157 for the second. The death rate last year (1.10) was also well below the mean rates, viz.: 1.29, 1.37, and 1.21 for the corresponding periods. In North Paddington 118 deaths were registered from phthisis, compared with averages of 142, 154, and 130 for the decennium and the two quinquennia; 287 and in South Paddington there were 24 deaths during the year, compared with averages of 26, 26, and 27. 'In comparison with the decennial averages, last year's returns for the sub-districts were 17 per cent. below the average in the Northern, and 8 per cent. below in the Southern. The death rate in the Northern District 1.23 (compared with averages of 1.48, 1.60, and 1.35), shows a greater diminution from the averages than does that of the Southern District, 0.72 (averages 0.80, 0.77, and 0.82). The deaths from "other tubercular diseases" were in each division of the Parish satisfactorily below the respective averages. (See Table 18). The total death rate from tuberculosis during the year was 1.52 in the Parish, 1.73 in North, and 0.93 in South Paddington. The extent of the diminution from the respective means is indicated below :— Total Tubercular Mortality, 1899. Differences from Means for— 1889-98. 1889-93. 1894-98. Paddington —0.38 -.0 49 —0.27 St. Mary —0.45 —0.58 —0.31 St. John —0.23 —0.29 -0.17 It is possible that the diminution here recorded in the Northern District may be even greater. The returns for many years have been carefully collated with the intention of examining the question more minutely after the next census. 288 The Registrar-General computed the local deathrate from phthisis at 1.15—or 0.05 above the rate arrived at by the Department. The rate for the Parish was lower than that for any of the districts immediately contiguous thereto, with the exception of that for Hampstead. Phthisis. Rates per 1,000 persons of all ages.

The deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia (398) were below the averages for the decennium (409), and for the first quinquennium (487), but above that for the second (339). The numbers for the two subdistricts showed similar differences (see Table 18). The death-rate for the Parish (3.08) was below the decennial mean-rate (3.18), that for North Paddington (3.50) above the mean (3.45), and that for South (1.89) below. The differences from the various means are indicated below :— Bronchitis and Pneumonia Death- Rates, 1899. Percentage Differences from Mean-rates. 1889-98. 1889-93. 1894-98.

Deaths of Infants under One Year. During the year 443 deaths were registered at ages under one year, one more than the corrected annual average for the preceding decennium (442), and three above that average after adjustment for the decrease in the number of children born. The infantile mortality last year was at the rate of 150 per 1,000 births registered, compared with mean rates of 149 for the decennium, and 146 and 153 for the two quinquennia. Since 1891 the deaths at these ages have been tabulated with more detail, and in Table 22 will be found the numbers of deaths recorded at 8 age-periods under one year in the two Sub-Districts. It will be seen from this Table that there was an increase in the mortalities among boys and girls in St. Mary's District, and a much greater decrease in 290 TABLE 22. Deaths at ages under 1 year.

The actual numbers recorded show very irregular changes, which will be more readily apprehended by a consideration of the figures in Table 22a. In this Table, it has been assumed that 1,000 births were registered in each area and sex mentioned, by which means the irregularities in the numbers depending on the inequalities of the births registered are got rid of. As regards the causes of death among these children (see Table 23), it will be noticed that last year the deaths due to Measles were much under the average, owing to the absence of any epidemic. If the annual average of 11 deaths be taken as the basis for distinguishing between epidemic and non-epidemic years, this disease was epidemic six times during 1889-98, and non-epidemic, four, viz. :— Epidemic Years.

Scarlet Fever is a rare cause of death at this age, only 5 cases being recorded in the ten years; Whooping Cough is a most regular cause of death, and shows but slight variation from year to year; and Diphtheria has recently been a fairly steady cause of death, but shows at length some indication of being either less 293 TABLE 23.

Diarrhœa, unfortunately, has been markedly more prevalent during the second half of the decennium than during the first, and the increase since 1897 has been striking. Moreover, the 94 deaths (35 in excess of the decennial average) do not complete the toll taken by this disease. For some years past, apparently more so since 1895, many deaths hitherto certified as due to "diarrhœa" have been ascribed to "enteritis," "gastro-enteritis," and other terms of a similar character. In considering the deaths from this (a most especial "filth" disease) the two groups should be taken together. The result of the combination is that the deaths which have to be attributed to "summer" or "epidemic" diarrhœa amount to 140, being only 14 short of double the average (77). The actual figures are as follow :— "Diarrhœa." "Enteritis." Total Diaerrhœa.

It will suffice on this occasion to state that the prime causes are (a) improper feeding; (b) improper treatment of the milk so commonly given to the children; (c) dirty conditions outside and inside the home, in the feeding utensils, and in the person. It is believed that the only action likely to lead to any material improvement is the appointment of a special officer to give the necessary time and attention to the removal of these causes. Without doubt education of young girls in the subjects of home hygiene and infant rearing, would do much to reduce the mortality—after a 296 lapse of some years. To effect any such improvement in the present day, an officer is required to advise parents, and to endeavour to mitigate the evil results of dirt and ignorance. Women have been found to carry out this work with success. Of the mortality from other diseases mentioned in Table 23, it will be noticed that the deaths from Tubercular Diseases have decreased from an annual average of 31 in the quinquennium 1889-93 to 21 last year; and those from Bronchitis and Pneumonia from an average of 77 in the quinquennium 1894-98 to 58. There was also a slight reduction in the mortality from Convulsions. There is no doubt that the freedom from prevalence of Measles favourably affected the mortality from these diseases last year. The deaths from Premature Birth (62) were somewhat above the average for the decennium (58), but were under the average for the second quinquennium (63). Congenital Malformations— including atelectasis—caused 13 deaths only, as against an annual average of 20 in the five years 1894-98. There was a considerable increase in the deaths from Suffocation, i.e., by overlaying in bed. At present the law takes no action in respect of such deaths, if the Coroner's finding is that the death was accidental. Undoubtedly many of the cases occur in the drunken 297 sleep of the parent or parents, and public opinion requires to be aroused against the reprehensible practice of having very young children in bed with adults. "Convulsions" and "Atrophy and Debility" being both vague and unsatisfactory as causes of death, it is natural to expect that the numbers of deaths returned under these headings will continue to shrink, as they have done in the past. DEATHS OF ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. During the year 54 deaths were recorded of children born out of wedlock, 46 at ages under 1 year, and 8 at ages 1 to 5 years. These deaths were distributed in the proportion of 51 to North Paddington and 3 to South, while 34 of the children were boys, and 20 girls. TABLE 24. 1899. Paddington. 0-1 1-5 M. F. M. F.

There were two deaths from the effects of anæsthetics, one from ptomaine poisoning, and one from an escape of coal gas into house. There wore six deaths from the taking of poison under various circumstances, including one suicide. 301 DEATHS IN INSTITUTIONS. In the local public institutions 606 deaths were recorded in the year, being 6 more than in 1898, 288 of the deceased persons being non-parishioners. From institutions, hospitals, &c., beyond the limits of the Parish, 155 deaths of parishioners were reported. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners recorded in institutions of all classes, was 460, 326 of which occurred in those maintained by rates, and 134 in those by voluntary subscriptions. The percentage of deaths in institutions to all deaths was 22.3, compared with 23.2 in 1898. LOCAL INSTITUTIONS. Paddington Workhouse & Infirmary 255, including 13 non-parishioners.

The customary Table setting out the numerical returns of some of the work will be found in the Table VI. in Appendix A. A few points which present more real interest, may be usefully referred to. Prevention of Infectious Disease. —On receipt of a notification, or information of an infectious illness not set down for notification, a visit is paid to obtain information as to matters relative to the origin and spread of the disease, and to ascertain whether the case should go to hospital or remain at home. The "visits of enquiry" for these purposes numbered 839 during 1899, compared with 2,781 in 1898, when measles was epidemic. These figures take no account of the visits and inquiries conducted by the Medical Officer of Health. The rooms disinfected during the year numbered 767— compared with 1,259 in 1898—and 32 tons of goods were removed for disinfection and cleansing. When *Parts of this Section of Report have been carried down to March 31st. 1900. 303 patients are treated at home, a "letter of advice" covering extracts of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and of the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1895, together with a sheet of precautions specially suited to the disease then prevalent in the house, is sent to the "parent or guardian of or other person responsible for" the patient. A form on which the Medical Attendant can certify the recovery and freedom from infection is also enclosed. During 1899, 121 such letters were sent out. It is desirable that disinfection should be carried out by the Staff of the Vestry, and it is, therefore, satisfactory to report that in 14 instances only was the work done privately. Hospital Accommodation.— There was no difficulty in securing the removal of patients ill with scarlet fever or diphtheria at any time during the year, and only an occasional delay with those ill with enteric fever during the late summer and early autumn. The last disease is one which is likely to cause least mischief if kept at home for a day or two. Acknowledgments have been frequently made to the Department for the prompt removal of patients and subsequent disinfection. Under favourable circumstances the patient has been out of the house and the room closed up for fumigation within two hours (often less) after receipt of the notification. 304 Schools.—There was no reason to interfere with the school routine of the year. Notices as required by the Act of 1891 were sent out for the notifiable diseases (except erysipelas) and for measles. The school teachers reported several cases of the latter disease during the year. Family Shelter.—Into the house provided for families displaced during the disinfection of their homes 21 families were received in 1899, 2 fewer than in 1898. The families included 80 individuals, 42 adults and 38 children. As there was (generally) less infectious disease during the year, it was a natural consequence that fewer persons required to use the accommodation provided. Moreover, there is in successive years a variation in the incidence of disease on the occupants of different classes of homes—i.e., number of rooms occupied. It is usually the inhabitants of single or two-room tenements who are admitted to the shelter. Disinfection.—Messrs. Armfield & Sons have continued to carry out the disinfection of bedding, etc. There have been no complaints as to the condition of the goods sent home, nor has there been any evidence that the processes employed have failed in their object. The expenditure last year on this account was £947, as compared with the amounts set out below for the preceding five years : 1894 £875 1896 £1,284 1895 £881 1897 £1,109 1898 £1,203 305 The question of erecting a station for this work has been before the Joint Works and Sanitary and the Sanitary Committees for some time past. For the fumigation of sick-rooms cake sulphur has been chiefly relied on, which is ordered to be used in the proportion of 1 lb. to 1,000 cu. ft.—an amount which is, in practice, always exceeded. Formaldehyde gas has also been used to some extent, and the spray machine (formalin) occasionally. Stripping and whitewashing after infectious illness have not been required unless the room has been dirty, or the wall-paper much torn. Izalpowder and carbolic soap have been distributed gratuitously to those who could not afford to purchase the same. The utility of disinfectants, as usually employed, is a very doubtful quantity— cleanliness and fresh air are more to be preferred and trusted. The expenditure for disinfectants of all kinds amounted to £52 last year, £50 less than in 1898. Houses Let in Lodgings.—The work under Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which had been more or less in abeyance since February, 1898, was resumed on the appointment of Mr. T. Mitchell as an Assistant Inspector to enforce that Section, in February, 1899. During the rest of the year (10 months) a large number of houses were visited for preliminary inquiries as to 306 tion, and 267 notices to furnish information were issued. For the purposes of registration 1,836 rooms were measured up and their cubic contents calculated. Between February and the beginning of December (i.e., during 9 months) 210 houses were formally placed on the Register, particulars of 17 other houses being also complete for registration, the final act being delayed pending a reconsideration of one of the Bye-laws. At the end of the year the register contained 406 houses. Practically all the houses in Clarendon, Cirencester, Woodchester, and Desboro' Streets have been registered, and a very large amount of work done there to bring the houses up to the comparatively low standard of the Bye-laws. The closet accommodation has been very nearly doubled, and a useful amount of white-washing and cleansing carried out. The question of the limit rentals prescribed by Bye-law 2—viz., 5s. per room for unfurnished tenements, and 7s. 6d. for furnished—was brought before the Vestry during the year and referred to the Sanitary Committee. The Medical Officer of Health was instructed to address enquiries to the other Metropolitan Authorities as to the limits prescribed by them and a full return was drawn up and presented to the Vestry on November 21st. It appeared that the local Bye-laws were singular in fixing a limit per room, such other Bye-laws as 307 scribed any limit, stating the amount per tenement (or lodging) independent of the number of rooms comprising the same. In several districts no limit rentals are prescribed, and it may be said in general that there is no fixed practice with reference to the point. Many sound arguments could be adduced in favour of omitting any reference to a "limit" rental—which, as a matter of fact, is not authorised by Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following Bye-law was finally adopted by the Vestry in substitution for the existing Bye-law No. 2, and is (at the time of writing) awaiting the approval of the Local Government Board:— (2.)—In any of the following cases a lodging house shall be exempt from the operation of these Bye-Laws, that is to say:— (a.)—Where the landlord himself resides on the premises and sub-lets not more than one tenement in the house occupied by him except the Sanitary Authority by express order direct such house to be registered. (b.) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of four shillings and sixpence per week, and upwards. (c.)—Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying not more than one room, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of six shillings per week, and upwards. 308 (d.)—Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of seven shillings and sixpence per week, and upwards. (e.)—Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger occupying two or more rooms, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, is at the rate of ten shillings per week, and upwards. In the course of preparing the report on the subject of the proposed change in the Bye-laws, one or two interesting items were collated. To determine the amount of over-crowding, if any, prevalent in the streets already registered, and the class of lodging in which such overcrowding prevailed, the actual and lawful numbers of inhabitants in Clarendon Street, thought to be the worst street in this respect, were compared. The figures obtained showed the slight extent to which overcrowding, as defined by the Bye-laws prevailed:— Clarendon Street. July, 1899. Total in Street. Overcrowded. Per cent. of all overcrowded. Lodgings of one room 214 28 13 „ two rooms 192 33 17 ,, three or more rooms 39 12 31 The rents paid for the various classes of lodgings in the houses on the Register, at the middle of December last, are indicated in the following statement:— 309 Class of Lodging. Rented at — per week. 1/6 2/- 2/6 3/- 3/6 4/- 4/6 5/- 5/6 6/- 6/6 7/- /6 Unfurnished : One room 7 57 187 106 106 160 *23 Two rooms †13 38 256 201 150 83 14 Three or more rooms †37 51 44 40 Furnished: One room (all) 1 3 18 7 4 * Registration not enforced at rents of 5/- and upwards, hence no information of higher rentals. † Apparently none let cheaper than this. From the foregoing statement lodgings rented at over 7/6 per week were intentionally excluded, as that was the limit commonly prescribed by the Byelaws of other Metropolitan Districts. In the houses on the Register at the date mentioned there were the following tenements (three or more rooms) let at 8/and upwards:— 8/- 8/6 9/- 9/6 10/- 10/6 13/- 15/13 5 5 2 6 6 4 2 These came on the Register under the old Byelaw—limit 5/- per room. It is very doubtful if the Act ever intended such class of lodgings to be registered, although the wording of Section 94, if strictly interpreted, includes them, and if the new Bye-law receive the approval of the Local Government Board, these lodgings will go off the Register. From a Return prepared by the Relieving Officers, it appears that of 389 applications for relief during one quarter of last year, 152 were made by 310 TABLE 26. Name of Street. Period Notifications.

The work done with reference to tenement houses has had, so far as a general survey of the streets on the register is concerned, an excellent effect, some idea of which can be obtained from an examination of the figures in the preceding table. It is not intended that any comparison should be instituted between the numbers of cases or deaths recorded in the different streets. Comparison is limited to the extent to which there has been an increase or decrease in those numbers in each street. The figures for North Paddington are added to show that the great diminution in prevalence of sickness and death in the registered streets has not been simply a part of an equal reduction in the whole district. House Drainage.—Once again it has to be recorded that the Bye-laws under Section 202 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, a draft of which was issued by the London County Council in January 1897, are still awaiting the approval of the Local Government Board. In the first Session of Parliament of last year, the London County Council secured the passing of the Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (Bye-Laws) Act, 1899, which provides for the deposit of plans and sections of works 313 of reconstruction of drains, etc.* The Local Government Board had decided that there was nothing in the Section mentioned which authorised the demand for such plans, etc.—a defect now remedied. During the past year 414 drains were reconstructed, tested with water and passed as sound, and 81 old drains were tested for various reasons and found still sound. The majority of the latter had been re-constructed under the supervision of the Sanitary Department, which now possesses a record of such work dating back to the end of 1889. Many other drains not on the register have been relaid without any notice being given, over the re-construction of which no supervision has been exercised. Combined drainage has demanded much time * The principal section of the Act enacts that the Council shall have power to frame bye-laws for the following purpose: — "Requiring persons about to construct, re-construct, or alter the pipes, "drains, or other means of communicating with sewers, or the traps and "apparatus connected therewith, to deposit with the sanitary authority of "the district such plans, sections, and particulars of the proposed con"struction, re-construction, or alteration, as may be necessary for the pur"pose of ascertaining whether such construction, re-construction, or alter"ation is in accordance with the statutory provisions relative thereto, and "with any bye-laws made under the said section." (i. e. Sec. 202, mentioned above.) Such plans are at present obtained in (probably) the majority of cases where drains are re-constructed or altered under the supervision of the local authorities. 314 and expenditure during the year.

On the last system it was found unnecessary to do more than provide proper means of access to the system. Orders for combined drainage were made under Sec. 74 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, in respect of— Brown's Yard, Newcastle Place 132, Westbourne Terrace, and Stables in rear 247, Maida Yale, „ „ 332 & 334, Harrow Road. Portnall House, Coomassie Road, and Stabhs in rear 5, 6, & 7, Kent's Place, North Wharf Road. No progress has been made towards obtaining an alteration of the existing law on this subject, nor has the Committee appointed by the Conference, first convened in 1895, been re-convened. 315 Trade Supervision.—All the cowsheds, slaughterhouses, dairies, milk shops, and bake-houses have been inspected at least twice during the year, several of them more frequently. Notices of new work-rooms are sent to the Department by the Home Office pursuant to Sec. 26 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1891, but during 1899 only 4 such notices were received, a number which suggests that the provisions of the Act—so far as concerns the giving of such notices by the occupiers of the work-rooms, to the Home Office—are not actively carried out. The workrooms were inspected, measured and entered on the local register, which contained at the end of the year 183 entries. Cards were issued for each workroom, indicating the number of workers which such room could lawfully accommodate. Such cards were issued for 68 rooms, most of which were dealt with by the Inspectors independently of the Home Office Officials. Complaints of insanitary conditions at 7 workrooms were received from the District Inspector of Factories, and dealt with. The total number of inspections of workplaces during the year was 145, more than double the total of 1898 (67). It cannot be questioned that the amount of supervision is even now insufficient. At the present time workrooms, as distinct from factories, are under triple control, viz., that of the Officers of the Home Office, of 316 the London County Council, and the Local Authority. Such overlapping is not only expensive—not to say wasteful—but gives rise to irritation on the part of the occupiers, who not unnaturally object to a succession of inspections. It does seem desirable that workrooms, where no question of danger from machinery arises, should be placed solely under the supervision of the Local Authority, subject to powers of intervention on the part of the Home Office and (or) the London County Council, similar to those provided by Sec. 100 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. At the same time local authorities should be required to appoint a sufficient number of officers to attend to the work, whose salaries should be paid from the Imperial Exchequer. The work involves not only the health of the employes, but also that of the community generally. Smoke Abatement.—A close watch has been kept over those shafts which have been in the past sources of complaint of nuisance. Details of two cases may be mentioned somewhat particularly. Complaints were received of smoke nuisance from the shaft of Usher's Brewery at the top of Queen's Road. It was found on inspection that the shaft consisted of a base and column of brickwork, about 4-ft. square, on top of which was an iron pipe of about 1-ft. diameter. The head of the pipe was not clear of the surrounding houses. The shaft was 317 manifestly unsuited to its work and the proprietors were required to take steps to abate the nuisance. A steam-air blast was fitted, which was found on trial to entirely prevent the emission of smoke from the shaft. In the autumn there was some difficulty m securing an unlimited supply of best Welsh coal, and from the middle of November until the middle of January last, black smoke was observed on several occasions from the shaft at the Generating Station of the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company in Amberley Road. A summons was issued for allowing black smoke to issue, contrary to the terms of an Order made by Mr. Curtis Bennett in the autumn of 1898. It came out in evidence that nothing had been done to comply with the Order except to fit certain appliances to consume the smoke, which appliances had not been used. The plea in defence was inability to get proper coal. Only one summons was originally taken out, but the Magistrate after hearing the case, directed that ten should be issued returnable at once, gave convictions on nine, fining the Company £1 with £2 2s. costs for each conviction, and dismissing the tenth without order as to costs. Cutting off of Water Supply.—The question of the existing powers of the Water Companies to cut off the supply from inhabited houses for non-payment 318 of water-rates was brought under the notice of the Sanitary Committee during last summer. The Medical Officer of Health was directed to report on the cases which had occurred in the Parish, and as to the legal powers of the Water Companies. The report was presented in September, and after discussion, the question was postponed for the collection of further information. Manure Removal—On the whole there have been fewer complaints of nuisance from this source. In the early summer notices requiring the removal of manure once in every 48 hours were extensively posted throughout the Parish, and handbills of the same notice left at each stable. In August of last year the County Council addressed the following communication to the Metropolitan Local Authorities:— The Council frequently receives complaints as to nuisance arising from peat moss litter and other stable manure at various premises in London, and on e.nquiry being made into the matter, it is generally found that the nuisance occurs when the manure is removed from the receptacles into which it has been placed, and in the course of such removal, which may take place two or three times a week. It has been suggested that the nuisance would be obviated if the manure were removed direct from the stables and placed into properly-constructed waggons, or into . movable receptacles, so that it could be taken out of the yard without being further manipulated. Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, enables a sanitary authority to deal with any manufactory, building, or premises, used for any trade business, process, or manufacture, 319 causing effluvia, on complaint made by the medical officer of health, or any two legally-qualified medical practitioners, or by any ten inhabitants of the district. The solicitor advises that, failing other means of remedying the evil, the court might well be asked, in the case of livery stables, cab or omnibus proprietors, and other similar businesses, to act under that Section in the matter, but that, in his opinion, the case could also be dealt with under the ordinary nuisance provisions of the Act (Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5), as being a nuisance which, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, is likely to recur, and that a Court might under those sections be asked to make a prohibition order which would probably have the effect of compelling the occupier to make some such arrangement to obviate the nuisance as has been suggested. The communication was referred to the Sanitary Committee for report, and when the matter was before that Committee the Medical Officer of Health informed the Committee that it was his practice, where complaints were made as to nuisance arising from the removal of peat moss manure from premises where many horses were kept, to recommend the provision of a cart or carts, into which the manure was to be loaded direct from the stalls, and removed from the premises without further disturbance. The Committee reported this to the Vestry, and the practice received the approval of the latter. Carts are being slowly and gradually substituted for manure receptacles, in accordance with the foregoing principle. By loading the manure direct from the stalls into the cart, and taking the cart away without disturbing the manure, the diffusion of that 320 particularly offensive odour which is peculiar to peat manure is avoided. It has been suggested that the removal of such manure should be regulated in the same way as is the removal of offal under Sec. 16 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The County Council having received many communications on the subject, have drafted an amendment of Bye-law 1, under that section, to the following effect:— Every person who shall remove or earry, or cause to bo removed or carried, by road or water in or through London any faecal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid shall be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through London, shall use or cause to bo used therefore a suitable carriage or vessel properly constructed and furnished with a sufficient covering so as to prevent the escape of any matter or liquid therefrom, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Such person shall not remove or carry, or cause to be removed or carried, such matter or liquid by road in or through London except during the following periods, viz.:— Between 5 o'clock a.m. and 10 o'clock a.m., or during the period commencing two hours before sunset and ending one hour after sunset, in any day during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October. Between 6 o'clock a.m. and 11 o'clock a.m., or during the period commencing two hours before sunset and ending one hour after sunset, in any day during the months of November, December, January, and February. Such person shall not remove or carry, or cause to be removed or carried, such matter or liquid by water in or through 321 London, except during the period commencing at sunrise and ending at sunset in any day. This Bye-law shall not apply to any person removing or carrying manure consisting only of horse dung, with a suitable proportion of straw, and shall not apply to any person removing or carrying in a suitable vessel, as aforesaid, manure consisting of horse dung and litter other than straw. The Bye-law at present in force is as follows:— 1. —Every person who shall remove or carry, by road or water, in or through London, any faecal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid, whether such matter or liquid shall be in course of removal or carriage from within or without or through London, shall not remove or carry such matter or liquid in or through London except between the hours of 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the forenoon during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, and except between the hours of 6 o'clock in the forenoon and 12 o'clock at noon during the months of November, December, January, and February. Such person shall use a suitable carriage or vessel properly constructed and furnished with a sufficient covering, so as to prevent the escape of any such matter or liquid therefrom, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Provided that this Bye-law shall not apply to the carriage of horse dung manure. The Vestry had already resolved (in December, 1895) that the removal of "fish offal, etc.," ought to be allowed at times other than those prescribed by the existing Bye-law, and (in July, 1898) that it was desirable that the removal of peat manure should be regulated under Bye-laws pursuant to Sec. 16 (1) of the Act. It was, therefore, agreed to endorse the proposed amendment of the Bye-law subject to the omission of the words "and shall not apply 322 other than straw" at the end of the Bye-law. This would prescribe fixed hours for the removal of peat moss litter. With the summer months there was the usual difficulty in securing the removal of manure. It seems likely that the only remedy for this is for the Vestry to undertake the work, throughout the year, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 36 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Manure is now almost a waste product in London, and what the Vestry would do with it after removal, it is almost impossible to say. Canals and Canal Boats.—The Report required under the Canal Boats Acts was presented to the Vestry in February of this year. It is satisfactory to note that no sickness was reported among the inhabitants of the boats, and no infringements of the Acts requiring legal proceedings. Legal Proceedings.—During the year 716 notices of all. kinds were issued, as compared with 793 in 1898 and 1,060 in 1897. Last year's notices comprised 431 "written intimations," 83 "orders," and 197 notices under Bye-laws. Eighteen cases were taken before the Magistrate and successfully contested. The nature of the offence and the result of each case are set out below. "Princess Alexandra," P.H., Summons for not complying with order of Cornwall Road.
