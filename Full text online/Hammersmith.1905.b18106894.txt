Mr. Lewis had held the position of Treasurer to the Borough Council and its predecessors since February, 1872, and the Council in accepting the resignation conveyed to him an expression of its appreciation of his valuable services as Treasurer of the Council and its predecessors for so many years. The vacancy was filled by the appointment of Mr. John Frederick Long, Mr. Lewis' successor at the London and County Bank, upon the same terms as those attaching to Mr. Lewis' appointment. (b) Town Clerk's Staff. It is with regret that the Council records the death on the 12th April, 1905, of Mr. William A. Webb, New Streets and Cemetery Clerk, who had completed 25 years in the service of the Council and its predecessors. 22 The vacancy thus caused was filled by the appointment on the 31st May, 1905 (from 157 applicants) under the title of "First Assistant Clerk," of Mr. Leslie Gordon, the Chief Committee Clerk of the Northampton Corporation, at a salary of ,£150 per annum, rising to £200 by annual increments of £10. At the same time a re-arrangement was made in the duties of the office staff generally. (c) Library Staff. The re-organisation of the staff of the Public Libraries Department having been rendered necessary by the erection of the Central (Carnegie) Library, the following alterations were made:— (a) Mr. H. P. Dinelli was transferred from Ravenscourt Park to take up the duties at the Central Library at his existing salary of £120 per annum with the addition of apartments, provided at the Library, and fuel and light. (b) Mr. E. E. Larner, First Assistant at the Passmore Edwards Library, was transferred to the Central Library as First Assistant, at the salary of £100 per annum. (c) Mr. W. J. Walker, Second Assistant at the Passmore Edwards Library, was promoted to the post of Sub-Librarian of the Ravenscourt Park Library, at a salary of £100 per annum. (d) Mr. C. Justice, the Superintendent of the temporary Reading Room in Brook Green Road, was transferred to and appointed First Assistant at Ravenscourt Park at a salary of £78 per annum. SUPERANNUATION OF EMPLOYEES. Superannuation allowances have, during the year, been granted under the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act, 1866, to the following employees of the Council, 23 who, by reason of old age, had become incapable of discharging their duties with efficiency:— Name. Occupation. Length of Service. Allowance. Alfred James Asphalte rubber 25 years 10/- per week William Funge Road sweeper 24 „ 7/6 „ William Bleu Groundman 21 „ 7/6 „ John William Martindale Road sweeper 14 „ 5/6 „ The first named died shortly after the allowance was granted to him. EMPLOYEES' SICK BENEFIT FUND. The number of contributors to the Sick Fund (established by the Council for the benefit of its employees) during the year was 276. There were 111 claims by 86 applicants on the Fund in respect of sickness, and claims for death allowances were made and paid in respect of the death of eleven contributors and two contributors' wives. The receipts and payments were as follows: — RECEIPTS. PAYMENTS. To Members' Contributions £ s. d. £ s. d. By Members' Sick Allowances £ s. d. £ s. d. 184 16 3 184 18 3 301 7 4 369 7 4 ,, Fine 0 2 0 „ Death Allowances 68 0 0 ,, Borough Council's Contributions Visiting Stewards' fees 196 17 9 9 5 10 London and County Bank Cheque Book 0 4 2 Balance in hand ... 378 17 4 2 18 8 £381 16 0 £381 16 It is satisfactory to note that the contributions of the Borough Council to the Fund were less by £74 3s. 2d. than in the preceding year. 24 HIGHWAYS. (a) Street Improvements. 1. King Street.—The London County Council has given its consent under Section 72 of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, to the widening of King Street, between Studland Street and Cambridge Road, the cost of which is estimated at £88,423, but no decision has as yet been arrived at with regard to the amount to be contributed by the London County Council to the cost of the work. During the year the Borough Council has been able to acquire under favourable conditions the following properties required in connection with the improvement:— Owner. Property. Description of Interest. Amount. G. & J. Neal Part of Nos. 74, 76 and 78 King Street Freehold £200 D. Matthews & Co., Ltd. Nos. 162, 164 and 166 ditto Lease expiring June, 1913, at a rental of £255 Trustees of the Estate of the late Francis McGowran Nos. 162 to 168 ditto Freehold £10,000 Palmer's Stores, Ltd. Nos. 152 and 152a ditto Lease expiring Michaelmas, 1943 £2,250 Mrs. E.M. Whaile Part of No. 96 ditto Copyhold £25 Mrs. Caroline Ayres Ditto Life Interest in lease expiring Michaelmas, 1944 £20 Trustees under the will of the late William Ayres Ditto Reversion in above lease £20 25 Owner. Property. Description of Interest. Amount. Marshal & Co. Ditto Sub-lease expiring 24th June, 1917, at a rental of £80 per annum £175 and cost of altering the premises estimated at £600 (Nos. 162-168 King Street.) In the case of Nos. 162, 164 and 166 King Street, the Council obtained vacant possession on completion of the purchase of the leasehold interest, and shortly after let the premises to Mrs. Judith Woolf on a quarterly tenancy from the 29th September, 1905, at a rental of £100 per annum for each shop. Arising out of this an action was brought against the Council by the freeholders to recover possession of the premises for breach of covenant of the lease in sub-letting the premises without the freeholders' consent, although application was made for this within two days of such sub-letting. The action was ultimately withdrawn on terms being agreed upon with the freeholders for the purchase of their interest. (No. 152A King Street.) Vacant possession was also given in the case of No. 152A King Street, and this shop has been let to Mr. John Jukes Cox, the lessee of No. 152 King Street, for one year from Christmas, 1905, at a rental of £40, this low rental being- agreed to in consequence of the expense which had to be incurred by Mr. Cox in putting in a new shop front, and in adaptingthe premises for the purposes of his business. Two sheds at the rear of the premises have been let to Mr. J. T. Weatherburn on a quarterly tenancy at a rental of £5 per annum. (No. 98 King Street.) It having come to the knowledge of the Council that Messrs. Thompson and Jackson had recently been granted a forty years' lease of No. 98 King Street, and proposed to make considerable alterations to the premises before entering into occupation, the Council deemed 26 it advisable to take steps for the acquisition of the portion of the premises required for the widening of King Street before the proposed alterations were made. It accordingly served notices to treat for this portion upon both the freeholder and leaseholder, under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, but the parties interested refused to negotiate except upon the basis that the whole of the premises were taken. A sealed tender for the portion required was then served by the Council on the leaseholders, who thereupon served on the Council a writ of injunction to restrain it from acting upon its notice to treat. As the object of the writ appeared to be to compel the Council to acquire the whole of the premises, the Council, having regard to the importance of the question as affecting other properties to be acquired for the King Street Improvement, decided to contest the action. The case was tried before Mr. Justice Buckley in the Chancery Division of the High Court, when the plaintiffs were represented by Mr. S. O. Buckmaster, K.C., and Mr. J. F. Waggett, and the Council by Mr. Astbury, K.C., and Mr. Courthope Munroe, and judgment was given on the 19th December, 1905, in favour of the plaintiffs. In granting the injunction the Judge held that the strip which the Council proposed to take was such as that the part was not separable from the house so that it could be removed without destroying the house as a house, and that the case was governed by the decision of the Divisional Court in Gordon v. St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, and the decision of Mr. Justice Stirling in Gibbon v. the Paddington Vestry. The Council gave notice of appeal from this decision, and subsequently the leaseholders expressed their willingness to sell the portion of the premises actually required. Negotiations are in progress both with them and the freeholder, and subject to a satisfactory settlement being arrived at the appeal will not be proceeded with. 2. Great Church Lane.—In addition to the expenditure of £12,229 1s. 10d., shown in the last report as the cost of carrying out the widening of Great Church Lane, the Council has paid £50 for the acquisition of a strip of land in front of the new parish hall in that thoroughfare. 3. Brook Green Road.—In addition to the premises named in the last report as having been acquired by the Council in connection with the widening of Brook Green Road, the following have been acquired during the year: 27 Lessee. Property. Description of Interest. Amount. Mr. Rosenbaun Mrs. Jane Hoale No. 2 Brook Green Road No. 22 ditto Sub-lease expiring Christmas, 1910 Ditto £ 379 £ 165 The sub-lease of the "Eagle" beer-house, No. 26 Brook Green Road, expired at Michaelmas, 1905, and the lessees, on giving up possession of the premises, paid £40 in settlement of all claims with regard to dilapidations. 4. Broadway.—Negotiations with several of the persons interested in properties required in connection with the widening of the Broadway are in progress. The interest of Mr. James George Butler, in No. 30 The Broadway, has been acquired for £100. 5. Fulham Palace Road.—The surplus land acquired by the Council in connection with the Fulham Palace Road Improvement was offered for sale by public auction on the 26th April, 1905, and was sold in two lots. The first lot (being the larger plot of ground) realised the sum of £2,000, and was bought by Mr. F. G. Lawrence, of Kingston-onThames, and the other lot realised the sum of £575, and was bought by Messrs. W. and A. Atkinson, of Hammersmith. The Auctioneer's commission and out of pocket expenses amounted to £50 8s. od., leaving the net proceeds £2,524 12s. od. The Local Government Board have, on the Council's application, consented to £2,215 of the sale proceeds being applied in repayment of the temporary loan borrowed for the purpose of the improvement, and the balance of such proceeds, £309 12s. od. in part payment of the capital expenditure of £341 7s. 7d., being the amount of the Council's contribution to the cost of acquiring Nos. 29 and 31 Paddenswick Road as an addition to Ravenscourt Park. 6. Scrubs Lane.—The London County Council is proceeding with the widening of Scrubs Lane under the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Act, 28 1903, for the purposes of the tramway from Putney to Harlesden, and has forwarded to the Council a statement of the cost incurred up to Michaelmas, amounting to £5,920 15s. 0d., of which sum the Borough Council has to pay one-third. Items:— Acquisition of property 50 0 0 Professional charges 5 5 0 Wages of chainmen 4 16 0 Reconstruction of Mitre Bridge 2,983 14 10 Reconstruction of Scrubs Lane Bridge 2,877 0 0 7. Hythe Road.—Reference was made in the Fourth Annual Report to the London County Council having sanctioned an amended plan, submitted by Mr. Edward Collins, for the formation of a new street, 40 feet in width, from Scrubs Lane to the western end of Hythe Road, which included the construction of a new bridge, 40 feet in width, over the West London Junction Railway, and the reconstruction of the bridge under the London and North Western Railway. Mr. Collins has not taken any steps to carry out this proposal on account of the great expense involved, and in January, 1906, he approached the Borough Council with a suggestion that an endeavour should be made to arrange with the London and North Western Railway Company for the widening of the existing approach to Hythe Road, and the construction of new bridges, towards the cost of which he was prepared to contribute. In accordance with this suggestion the Railway Company was communicated with, and a reply was received to the effect that the proposal, involving as it did the raising of the railway for the purpose of improving the roadway, would so seriously prejudice the Company that they found themselves unable to agree to the suggestion, the gradient of the railway being already undesirably steep. Upon this communication Mr. Collins was informed that the Council considered that the only way to deal with the matter was for him to proceed with the new road and bridge as approved by the London County Council. 8. Jeddo Road Extension.—The Council has agreed to construct, in conjunction with the Acton Urban District Council, a new street to connect Jeddo Road with new streets on the Cowper-Essex Estate, Acton. The proposal includes the payment by each Council of £100 to the freeholder, as consideration for the loss he would incur in giving up the land required for the road. The expense of making up, paving, and sewering the portion of the road situate in each district is to be defrayed by the respective authorities, 29 the estimated cost of the portion chargeable to the Borough Council being £120. The London County Council has signified its consent to the improvement, and the matter is proceeding. (b) Maintenance of Streets Forming Boundary with Fulham. The London County Council has made an order, dated 17th May, 1905, for giving effect to the agreement which the Borough Council entered into with the Fulham Council for the maintenance of the streets forming the boundaries of the two boroughs. (c) Breaking up Highways. The Council has approved of a series of resolutions passed at a Conference convened by the Metropolitan Paving Committee, and held on the 19th May, 1905, expressing the opinion that greater powers should be given to the Highway Authorities with regard to the opening of public streets for the purpose of gas, water, hydraulic, electric, telephonic, telegraphic, tramway and similar undertakings; and that a Bill should be introduced by His Majesty's Government embodying model clauses for the better protection of the local authorities in the matter. (d) Motor Car Traffic on Highways. The Council has approved of resolutions passed at a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils convened by the Paddington Council, directing the attention of the President of the Local Government Board to the fact that the regulations relating to heavy motor cars had been framed without consultation with the authorities who were responsible for the maintenance of streets ; and suggesting certain alterations with regard to the weights and rate of speed of such cars. The Conference, moreover, appointed representatives to place its views before the Royal Commission on Motor Cars. (e) Street Nomenclature. Orders have been made by the London County Council for the alteration in the naming of streets and numbering of premises, viz. :— 30 Date of Order. Particulars of Alterations. 17th May, 1905 Heath Place re-named Thorpebank Road. 2nd June, 1905 Dalling Road (West Side), houses renumbered. 18th July, 1905 Brook Street re-named Worlidge Street. 31st October, 1905 Collingbourne Street re-named Collingbourne Road. „ „ „ Dunraven Street re-named Dunraven Road. 5th December, 1905 Keith Gardens incorporated with Keith Grove, and houses re-numbered. (f) Costermongers in King Street. On the 19th April, the Council adopted a resolution expressing the opinion that, having regard to the congested condition of King Street and the large expense involved in the proposed widening thereof, the time had arrived when it had become absolutely necessary to remove the itinerant traders from that street, and referring it to the Law and Parliamentary Committee to take the necessary steps for their removal within a period of six months. In accordance with that instruction, notice was served upon each person who was in the habit of standing with a barrow or stall in King Street, that in consequence of the obstruction thereby caused, the Council would not permit the continuance of the practice after the 1st October. This notice was, however, disregarded, and it therefore became necessary for proceedings to be taken in the matter. Summonses were accordingly applied for and granted under the Metropolitan Police Act, 1839, against 33 offenders, and were heard before Mr. Lane, K.C., at the West London Police Court. The Council was represented by Mr. Bodkin, of Counsel, and the defendants by Mr. Elliott, of Counsel. The hearing occupied several afternoons, and Mr. Lane gave his decision on the 26th January, 1906, in favour of the Council, and inflicted a nominal penalty upon the defendants in each case. With five exceptions the costermongers removed their barrows from King Street and took up positions in 31 Bradmore Lane. Further proceedings were taken against the five who had disregarded the Magistrate's decision, which were heard on the 9th March, but a few days before then the men had discontinued the practice, and consequently only small penalties were inflicted, and none of the costermongers have taken up positions in King Street since. (g) Tramways from Queen Street to Putney. On the 10th June, 1905, the London County Council informed the Borough Council that it had made application to the Board of Trade for approval of the conduit system of electrical traction proposed to be adopted for the tramway from Queen Street, Hammersmith, to Putney, and furnished a copy of the drawings showing the system of traction, together with a statement of the materials to be used for the work. The London County Council proposed to use granite setts for paving the whole of the space between the rails throughout, as all wood at present used for street paving was subject to very considerable expansion from wet and from frost, and difficulty had been experienced where portions of the conduit tracks had been paved with wood. The Borough Council very strongly objected to the substitution of granite setts for wood paving between the tramway tracks in this Borough, on the ground of the great nuisance and annoyance which would be caused by the passing of the general traffic thereon, and made representations to the Board of Trade and to the County Council in favour of the adoption of hard wood paving as the material to be used. The London County Council declined to agree to this proposal, and the Board of Trade, in giving their decision on the 21st August, stated that after careful consideration of the objections brought to them by the Borough Council and of the London County Council's reply thereto, the Board had approved, in pursuance of the London County Council (Electrical Power) Act, 1900, the plans showing the rail, paving, sub-structure and electrical arrangements proposed for the County Council tramways in question within the Borough, subject to any agreements between that Council and the Borough Council in regard to the points which had been brought before the Department. At the date of this report joint action is being taken with the Fulham Borough Council in a further endeavour to obtain an alteration of the decision to use granite setts. 32 PARLIAMENTARY. The following Acts and Parliamentary Bills have received consideration during the year: — (a) Great Western Railway (New Lines) Act, 1905. The Great Western Railway (New Lines) Bill, 1905, to which reference was made in the last report, has passed into law. The Act contains clauses for the protection of the interests of the Borough in the following matters:— i. The Company to construct and maintain two foot-bridges over the railway to connect Ducane Road with the estate on the south side; ii. For the purpose of enabling the Hammersmith Council to construct a new road to be made from Wood Lane to Latimer Road, both in the Borough, between the points A and B on the plan and section marked A, the Company to give up so much of the land required to form the said road as the Company shall acquire to a width of 50 feet, and to dedicate the same to the public for the purpose of making and forming the said new road, and to contribute towards the construction of the said new road such a sum as will cover the extra cost involved in the construction thereof by reason of the construction of railways Nos. 3 and 4, and by reason of the alteration of the site of the proposed new road from that originally contemplated by the Hammersmith Council between the points C and D on the said plan and section, and the said extra cost shall include the sum of £1,770, which the Trustees of the estate of Augustus Bird offered to contribute towards the expense of the construction of the road through their property at the point originally contemplated, and the Company at all times hereafter, at their own expense, to maintain the structure of the bridge necessary to carry the said new road over the said railways Nos. 3 and 4. And the Company to consent to the continuation of the proposed new road under the West London Railway at the point marked E on the said plan, and to use their best endeavours to obtain a like consent from the London and North Western Railway Company, subject to proper terms and conditions with regard to the payment for the easement under the said railway, and the manner in which the works are to be carried out being agreed between the parties; 33 iii. The Company to construct the bridge to carry Wood Lane over Railway No. 3, authorised by this Act, in such a way as to make the gradient of the roadway on both sides of the crown of the said bridge not steeper than 1 in 40. In the construction of the last-mentioned bridge the Company to make provision for all vehicular and pedestrian traffic along Wood Lane to the reasonable satisfaction of the Hammersmith Council, and so as to interfere with the said traffic as little as possible; iv. If the Company shall acquire and demolish the properties between the Uxbridge Road Station of the West London Railway, and the Shepherd's Bush Station of the Central London Railway, they will set back the frontage of the said properties for the purpose of widening Uxbridge Road to the line indicated on the plan marked B.; v. A clause for the protection of the Council's electric lighting mains, pipes, or apparatus; vi. The Company to submit to the Council for their reasonable approval plans and sections of all bridges referred to, and the same to be constructed in accordance with such plans and sections when approved; and vii. Any dispute or difference which rriay arise between the Company and the Council to be settled by arbitration. (b) Underground Electric Railways, 1905. The Bills introduced last year by the Central London Railway Company and the Great Northern, Piccadilly, &c., Railway Company for power to construct new railways in Hammersmith and elsewhere, particulars of which were given in the last report, were withdrawn by the promoters shortly before the end of the Session. (c) Metropolitan District Railway Bill, 1906. This Bill has been introduced by the Metropolitan District Railway Company for the purpose of enabling it, inter alia, to acquire additional lands in Queen Street, and Great Church Lane, adjoining their station in the Broadway. The Council decided not to offer any objection to the proposals. 34 (d) Hammersmith, City, and North East London Railway Bill, 1906. By this Bill the promoters seek powers to construct an underground railway, commencing in Chiswick and proceeding via King Street, The Broadway and Hammersmith Road to the City and North-East London, and also to compulsorily acquire certain lands in Hammersmith for a generating station and other purposes. The Council lodged a petition against the Bill, and negotiations are pending with the promoters for the insertion of clauses for the protection of the interests of the Borough. (e) Electric Power Bills, 1905, The Administrative County of London Electric Power Bill, referred to in the last report, was opposed before the House of Lords Committee by this Borough Council, acting conjointly with other Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Bill, after being amended in Committee by certain boroughs (including Hammersmith) being excluded from the proposed area of the undertakers, passed the House of Lords. It, however, failed to pass the House of Commons, as the Committee of that House, which found the preamble to be proved, was unable to report in time for the third reading. The Metropolitan Electric Supply Company's Bill, which the Council also joined with other Borough Councils in opposing in the House of Lords, was, after being amended to the satisfaction of the Councils interested, passed both houses and received the Royal Assent on the nth August, 1905. The total expenses incurred in the joint oppositions before the House of Lords Committee were, in respect to the Administrative Company's Bill, £4,885 19s. 4d., and in respect to the Metropolitan Supply Company's Bill, £359 8s. 7d.; the proportions payable by the Council were £230 2s. 7d. and £71 17s. 9d. respectively, which, with cost of copies of evidence, have been charged to the Electricity Revenue Account. (f) Electric Power Bills, 1906. Bills to enable the undertakers to supply electricity in bulk have been promoted by the London County Council, by a Company proposed to be formed under the title of The Additional Electrical Power Supply (London) Company, and by the West London Electric Undertakers' Association. The 35 Council lodged a petition against each of the Bills. The Additional Electrical Power Supply (London) Bill was rejected on second reading. The other Bills are under consideration. (g) Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905. Upon the introduction of the Unemployed (Workmen) Bill, 1905, a conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils was convened by the London County Council to consider the proposals contained therein. The conference adopted a series of resolutions objecting to some of the proposals of the Bill, particularly with regard to the funds being provided from local instead of national sources, and to its not being made compulsory throughout the country. The Borough Council concurred in the resolutions, and communicated with the Prime Minister and the President of the Local Government Board in support thereof. The Bill, however, with some modifications, duly passed into law. The Act provided for the establishment, by order of the Local Government Board, of a Distress Committee of the Council of every Metropolitan Borough in London, consisting partly of members of the Borough Council and partly of members of the Board of Guardians, and of persons experienced in the relief of distress, of whom at least one member should be a woman. Provision was also made for the appointment of a Central Body for the whole of the Administrative County of London, consisting partly of members of, and selected by, the Distress Committees, and of members of, and selected by, the London County Council, and partly of persons co-opted to be additional members of the body, and, if the order so provided, of persons nominated by the Local Government Board. The order for the establishment of the Distress Committees and Central Body was issued by the Local Government Board on the 20th September, 1905, and provided, in the case of Hammersmith, for the appointment by the Borough Council of a Distress Committee consisting of 20 members, constituted as follows:— Appointed by the Borough Council from their own body 10 Appointed by the Borough Council and being persons selected by the Board of Guardians 6 36 Appointed by the Borough Council from outside their own body (of whom one at least should be a woman), but from persons experienced in the relief of distress 4 The order prescribed certain formalities to be observed in the appointment of the Distress Committees, and these having been duly complied with, the Council on the 18th October, 1905, appointed the Committee. A list of the members appointed is set out in the report of the Distress Committee appended. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The competitive designs for the erection of the public baths and washhouses, were received in April, 1905, from the six selected architects, named in the last annual report, and upon the report of the Baths and Washhouses Committee which, assisted by the Borough Surveyor, adjudicated on the plans, the Borough Council, on the 31st May, 1905, selected the design marked No. 4, and appointed the author, Mr. J. Ernest Franck, A.R.I.B.A., of No. 11 Pancras Lane, E.C., as the architect of the buildings, subject to its being found possible to carry out the work for the stipulated sum of ,£45,000. Messrs. Dow, White and Gee were subsequently appointed the surveyors to prepare the Bills of Quantities, and tenders were invited by public advertisement for the work. In response 36 tenders were received, the lowest being that of Messrs. Charles Dearing and Son in the sum of £45,000, which the Council accepted on the 1st November, 1905. Mr. Archibald Brown, of 13 Digby Mansions, was appointed Clerk of Works of the buildings at a salary of £5 per week, and no time was lost in starting the work, which is now making good progress. Application was made in due course to the Local Government Board for sanction to the borrowing of 37 ,£48,000 required to meet the cost of the buildings and the architect's and surveyor's fees. Major J. Stewart, R.E., one of the Board's Inspectors, held a public inquiry into the application on the 30th November, 1905, at the Town Hall, at which no objection to the granting of the application was made. Correspondence has since passed between the Board and the Council relative to matters of detail connected with the construction of the buildings, which has caused delay in the granting of the application. An arrangement has been come to with the London County Council with regard to the construction of party walls between the buildings of the Baths and Washhouses and the Technical Institute, and agreements have been entered into with the owners of No. 37 Mardale Street and No. 25 Brooklyn Road, with regard to the building of the external wall on the south side of the site. CARNEGIE PUBLIC LIBRARY. The Borough Council decided upon the completion of the building of the new public library in Brook Green Road to have a formal opening ceremony in connection therewith. Dr. Andrew Carnegie, who so generously furnished the sum of £10,000 towards the cost of the building, was in the first place asked to perform the function, but his engagements prevented him from accepting the invitation. His Grace the Duke of Argyll, K.T., was then approached and very kindly consented to officiate. The ceremony took place on the 24th July, 1905, in the presence of the Worshipful the Mayor (Alderman Levy), the Chairman and members of the Public Libraries Committee, and a large number of inhabitants of the Borough. After an introductory statement by the Chairman of the Committee (Alderman Acton Phillips), and the presentation of a golden key to His Grace by the Mayor, on behalf of the Borough 38 Council, the Duke of Argyll in an appropriate speech declared the library open. A full account of the opening ceremony with a description of the building is published with the Librarian's Report appended. The total cost incurred in connection with the erection and furnishing of the library was as follows: — Erection of Buildings £ S. d. 12.153 O 0 Architect's and Surveyor's fees, and Clerk of Works' salary 1,299 12 4 Furniture and Fittings 1,662 6 10 £15.114 19 2 OPPOSITION TO NEW LICENCES. Notices of intended application to the Kensington Bench of Justices for new licences for the sale of intoxicating liquors at the undermentioned places in the Borough having been received, the Borough Council decided to oppose all the applications with the exception of that of Mr. Klempner. All the applications opposed were refused by the Justices: Premises. Nature of Licence. Proposed Licensee. Site of the proposed International Industrial Exhibition, lying between the Uxbridge Road on the South and Ducane Road on the North, and Old Oak Road on the West and the West London Extension Railway and Wood Lane on the East The "BradmoreTavern," 30 Brackenbury Road Ditto Ditto The "Imperial Restaurant," 20 Shepherd's Bush Green Intoxicating Liquors (Provisional) Intoxicating Liquors Beer Wine *Beer& Wine Imre Kiralfy William Daniel Prince ditto ditto John Max Klempner •Application to remove the restriction as to early closing. 39 PUBLIC HEALTH. (a) Accommodation for Measles. Representations have been made to the Local Government Board in support of the action taken by the Battersea Borough Council in favour of authority being given to the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide hospital accommodation for cases of measles. (b) Diagnosis of Diphtheria. Arrangements have been made with the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, whereby medical men practising in the Borough are enabled to have, at the Council's expense, bacteriological examinations made of specimens from the throats of persons within the Borough suspected to be suffering from diphtheria. (c) By-laws as to Houses let in Lodgings. After some correspondence with the Local Government Board, the Borough Council, upon the Board's suggestion, adopted a new series of by-laws with respect to Houses let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, which were allowed by the Local Government Board on the 10th October, 1905, and whereby the by-laws made by the Council's predecessors on the 8th January, 1896, were repealed. By the new by-laws the limit of rental in the exemption clause was increased in the case of unfurnished rooms from 5s. to 7s. 6d. per week, and in the case of furnished rooms from 8s. to 10s. per week. (d) Infantile Mortality. In view of the high rate of infantile mortality in the Borough, the Borough Council, upon a report of its Public Health Committee, decided on the 7th February, 1906, to appoint a Lady Health Visitor, whose duties would include inquiry into the births and deaths of infants in the poorer parts of the Borough, and the giving of advice as to the care and feeding of infants. It was subsequently determined that the salary of the office should be £100 per annum, and that the person to be appointed should have special knowledge or practical experience in matters of hygiene, and particularly in the feeding, nursing and rearing of children. 40 In addition, particulars of advice as to the care and feeding of infants were drawn up by the Public Health Committee, and ordered to be printed on cards for distribution by the Health Visitor. In order to assist the Lady Health Visitor in the execution of her duties, arrangements have been made with the SubDistrict Registrars for furnishing the Medical Officer of Health with the particulars of each birth registered in the Borough. The Council has also supported the action of the Kensington Borough Council in urging upon the Local Government Board the desirability of introducing a Bill in the ensuing session of Parliament for reducing the time limit for the registration of a birth from forty-two to twenty-one days. ELECTRIC LIGHTING UNDERTAKING. As from the 1st October, 1905, the method hitherto adopted of charging for the supply of electricity for private lighting upon the maximum demand indicator system was abolished, and in lieu thereof a flat rate of 3d. per unit was adopted. At the same time the rate of charge for electricity supplied for power purposes was altered to a Uniform rate of 1½d. per unit, subject to the following discounts:— Amount of Discount. On accounts not exceeding £ 10 per annum Nil. Do. exceeding £10, but not exceeding £ 25 per ann. 10 per cent. Do. £25 do. £50 do. 20 do. Do. £50 do. £100 do. 30 do. Do. £100 331/3 do. The sum of ,£3,000, being part of the net profit in the undertaking for the year 1904-5, was transferred to the relief of the rates for the past year. 41 CEMETERY. (a) Margravine Road. The Borough Cemetery in Margravine Road has an area of 16½ acres, and was opened in November, 1869.

In order to preserve the rights of the Council, two bodies of children have during the year been interred in the ground at Mortlake, purchased by the Council for the purpose of a Cemetery. The remainder of the land not being at present required for burial purposes, has been let to Messrs. Stevens Brothers, for agricultural purposes, at a rental of £5 per acre. FINANCE. (a) Audit of Accounts. The accounts of the Borough Council for the year ended 31st March, 1906, have been audited by Mr. A. Carson Roberts, the District Auditor, and are published separately. The Auditor's report thereon is as follows:— Metropolitan Boroughs Audit District. District Auditor's Report. The Grove, Dulwich, S.E., 9th July, 1906. To the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen, I beg to report that I have closed the Audit of the Accounts of the Council for the year ended at the 31st day of March last. 43 Expenditure. The following items of expenditure have been covered for this occasion by special' sanctions under the Local Authorities (Expenses) Act, 1887:— £ s. d. Subscriptions to Outside Associations 14 14 0 Expenses of Free Lectures 4 11 6 Foundation Stone and Opening Ceremony, Library 124 10 6 Refreshments for Assessment Committee 41 17 11 In giving their sanction the Local Government Board state that they cannot undertake to sanction further payments of subscriptions or for free lectures. Electricity Accounts. There is one point to which I must call attention in regard to these accounts, which otherwise are in a very sound state in regard to the correct statement of the position. There has been delay in obtaining sanction for, or in raising, new loans, to an etent which has materially postponed the incidence of the repayment charges. The profit and loss account cannot be correct unless the loans are raised as soon as the corresponding expenditure is incurred. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) A. CARSON ROBERTS, District Auditor. (b) Estimates, 1906-7.

(a) Valuation Lists. The quinquennial revaluation of the whole of the properties in the Borough was made, pursuant to the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, at the beginning of the year. The Valuation List was prepared by the Rating and Valuation Committee, assisted by the valuers appointed by the Council, viz.: Messrs. Hedley, Mason and Hedley and Mr. J. H. Richardson. A considerable amount of time was devoted by the Committee to the work, twenty-six meetings being held in connection therewith, and every care was exercised to arrive at a just and accurate valuation of each property.

Totals 101 100 261 7 0 124 0 6 51 The cases under the Electric Lighting Order included one in which proceedings were taken against Mr. Mulholland in the Brompton County Court, for the recovery of the sum of £53 175. 3d., for electric current supplied to the King's Theatre, between the 18th May and 31st July, 1903. Mr. Mulholland contested this claim on the ground that the rebates which had been allowed off the account in consequence of the inaccuracy of the meter upon which the charges for continuous current were made, had not been correctly calculated; and also made a counter claim of £153 in respect of loss sustained by him owing to the Council's alleged negligence in failing to supply continuous electric current to the theatre by a given date. The case was heard by his Honour Judge Selfe on the 13th October, 1905, when he decided that the Council's claim must be reduced by £16 3s. 8d., leaving a balance of £36 13s. 7d. due. Upon the counter-claim the Council raised several points of law, in addition to the contention that it never did agree to supply the continuous current by a specified date. After these points had been argued by counsel, his Honour stated . that unless a settlement could be arrived at, the counter-claim would have to be dealt with by the High Court, and intimated that in view of the great expense which would be entailed he thought the case should be settled. His Honour was informed that before the action was begun the Council had offered Mr. Mulholland £39, the amount of the penalties it had enforced against the contractors for delay in supplying the motor generator, which delay was the cause of the trouble, but he had refused this; Mr. Mulholland's counsel thereupon offered to accept this amount in satisfaction of the counter-claim. A settlement was ultimately agreed to whereby the claim and counter-claim were to be set off, one against the other, each side paying their own costs. MISCELLANEOUS. The following matters of a miscellaneous nature have been under consideration during the year:— Vote of Thanks to the Ex-Mayor and Mayoress. On the 1st of November, 1905, a resolution was unanimously passed, thanking Councillor Joseph Morris 52 Levy for the valuable services he had rendered to the Borough during his Mayoralty; and a resolution was also passed cordially thanking the Mayoress, Mrs. J. M. Levy, for the kind and gracious manner in which she had assisted the Mayor in the important public and social duties of his position during his year of office. At a subsequent meeting of the Council a copy of the resolutions, engrossed on vellum, was formally presented to Alderman Levy. Portrait of the Ex-Mayor Alderman Pascall. At the meeting of the Council on the 26th July, 1905, a portrait of Alderman Charles Pascall, the Ex-Mayor, painted by Mr. C. E. Butler, was presented to that gentleman by the Mayor, on behalf of the members of the Council. Alderman Pascall, having thanked the donors, asked the Council to accept the portrait for hanging in the Council Chamber, and the gift was accepted. Portrait of the late Alderman Canon White. The Council at a meeting on the 7th February, 1906, accepted a portrait of the late Alderman Rev. Canon White, painted in oils by Mr. Le Brun de L'Hopital, which was presented by the Rev. Dean Clements, on behalf of the subscribers. The portrait has been hung in the Council Chamber. Latymer Foundation.

The boundary fence of Rosebank Wharf in Holyport Road has been replaced by a 9-inch wall with 18-inch piers, at a total cost of £344 13s. 1d. Street Betting. In support of the action initiated by the Richmond Corporation, the Borough Council has presented a petition to His Majesty's Government, urging the introduction of a short Bill empowering Justices, upon second and subsequent convictions of persons for the offence of street betting, to convict the offender to prison without the option of a fine. The petitions of the local authorities were supported by a deputation which waited upon the Secretary of State for the Home Department on the 29th March, and on which the Council were represented by Alderman Pascall. 54 Combined Drainage. The question of the unsatisfactory condition of the law as to combined drainage has been again under consideration, and a communication has been addressed to the President of the Local Government Board in support of representations made to him by the London Borough Officers' Association, for the introduction of legislative remedies for the serious difficulties met with by the local authorities in reference thereto. Royal Commission on London Traffic. Reference was made in the fourth report to the evidence which was given on behalf of the Council before the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the means of locomotion and transport in London. The Commission has completed its labours and issued its report, which comprises, amongst other proposals, the following affecting highways in this Borough :— (a) The widening of the Great Western Road out of London, which includes Hammersmith Road and King Street (suggested by the Advisory Board of Engineers); (b) The construction of tramways :— i. Across Hammersmith Bridge, to connect the authorised tramways of the London County Council, at the north end of the bridge, with those of the London United Tramways Company at the south of the bridge; ii. Between Hammersmith and Knightsbridge; and iii.

The Borough Council has addressed a petition to the Lord Chancellor, in support of the representations which have been made to him by the Metropolitan Borough Councils' Association, upon the initiative of this Council's representatives, for an inquiry into the adequacy of the present arrangements for the conduct of business at the Metropolitan County Courts with a view to further facilities being afforded. The Council's petition had reference more particularly to the necessity for a re-arrangement of the West London County Court Districts. Shop Hours Act, 1904. The Hammersmith Borough Council was represented at a conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils, north of the Thames, convened by the Islington Borough Council, which was held at the Town Hall, Islington, on 23rd November, for the purpose of considering the Shop Hours Act, when the following resolution was adopted by the conference:— "That this conference expresses its opinion that a prima facie case has been made out for putting in force the Shop Hours Act, 1904, but that seeing the importance of adjoining Boroughs acting with some degree of uniformity in dealing with its provisions, a Committee of two representatives of each of the Boroughs here represented and of such other Boroughs north of the Thames as are willing to join, be appointed to enquire and report as to the general terms and conditions of the orders to be made." The Borough Council appointed Alderman J. M. Levy and Councillor W. P. Hunter to act as its representatives on the Committee above referred to. The Committee subsequently addressed a communication to the Councils of the Metropolitan Boroughs north of the Thames, and the Councils of the districts outside the County of London immediately adjoining the boundaries of the said boroughs, asking whether they would be prepared to make orders under the Act for closing shops in the areas under their jurisdiction, where assistants were employed, at 9 p.m. on three days, 2 p.m. on one day, 10 p.m. on one day, and 11.30 p.m. on one day, in each week during the year with the exception of holiday times. 56 The Borough Council passed a resolution approving of the hours of closing suggested, and is now waiting a further communication from the Committee as to the further steps it suggests should be taken in the matter. Masic, Dancing, Theatres, &c., Licences. By sub-section (V.) of section 3 of the Local Government Act, 1888, the powers of the Justices under the Licensing Act (25 Geo. 11. c. 36) to deal with applications for licences for music and dancing were transferred to the County Council, and by section 7 of the same Act, the powers of the Justices under the 6 and 7 Vict. c. 68, in respect to the licensing of houses or places for the public performance of stage plays were also transferred to the Council, by whom regulations were made for the guidance of applicants, and for the manner of dealing with applications.

Representations were made to the Council by the Overseers of the Urban District Council of Acton, as to the desirability of erecting additional boundary stones and restoring others where necessary on the boundary of their parish with this borough, between Willesden Junction and the Great Western Railway. The Works Committee, after viewing the boundary with the Overseers of Acton, agreed with them as to the positions of new stones and for payment of half the cost incurred in providing them. Owing to the erection of houses in Valetta Road, two of the stones on the boundary between Larden Road and Warple Way were standing in the middle of the gardens at the rear of the houses. It was agreed with the Acton Overseers to move the stones so as to stand against the fences of the gardens. DUSTING.

Plans, specifications, estimates and apportionments have been prepared and presented to the Council for making up and taking over the following roads, viz.:— Road leading to Brook Green Works. Collingbourne Road. Halsbury Road (Sect. II.). Osman Road (Sect. II.). The road making and paving works having been completed in the following roads and streets at the cost of the owners of property abutting on them, they are now repairable by the Council:— £ s. d. Ormiston Road (Section II.) 566 3 4 Wendell Road (Sect. IV.) 371 17 8 Emlyn Road (Sect. I.) 810 18 5 Road leading to Brook Green Works 332 7 1 STREET IMPROVEMENTS. King Street. After considerable negotiation with the London County Council, they stated they were prepared to view favourably a proposal to contribute on the usual conditions one half of the net cost of widening King Street, between Studland Street and Cambridge Road, the contribution being limited to £44,212, but the Improvements Committee of the London County Council informed the Borough Council that to comply with the requirements of the Council's standing orders it was necessary to insert in any report to the Council on the subject of the improvement, an estimate of the cost of widening King Street, at some future date, between Waterloo Street and the Broadway. The Borough Surveyor on the instructions of the Special Purposes Committee, prepared an approximate estimate of the cost of widening King Street on the south side, between the Broadway and Waterloo Street amounting to £337,000, and such estimate was directed to be forwarded to the County Council. Ultimately a letter was received from the County 84 Council to the effect that the Improvements Committee after a full and careful review of all the facts, and particularly having regard to the present heavy financial commitments of the Council, could not see their way to advise the Council to contribute any part of the cost of the improvement. But, in view of the Borough Council's desire to acquire immediately on favourable terms some of the property needed for the improvement under these special circumstances, this would not necessarily prejudice the case in the event of the Borough Council desiring the County Council at some future time to reconsider the request for a contribution of part of the cost of the improvement. In order that advantage might be taken of any favourable opportunity arising for the acquisition of any of the properties required for the widening of King Street, the Borough Council passed the usual resolutions for putting into force the provisions of Michael Angelo Taylor's Act. The service of these resolutions would only be done in special cases which could not otherwise be dealt with. Favourable opportunities having occurred for the acquisition of several interests in various properties in the street, negotiations were opened with the owners, and in some instances completed, for the purchase of the properties as follows:— Nos. 74, 76 and 78. The freeholders of these premises informed the Borough Council of their intention to rebuild these premises. The Council decided to avail themselves of this opportunity of acquiring the narrow strips of land projecting beyond the general line of buildings on either side of these premises, and after some negotiation terms were arranged for the purchase of the strips. The new premises have been built to the improved line of frontage. Nos. 162, 164, 166 and 168. The freehold interest in these premises has been purchased by the Borough Council, the leasehold interest in Nos. 162, 164 and 166 has also been acquired by the Council. Nos. 152 and 152a. The leasehold interest in these premises and of the buildings at the rear has been purchased by the Council.7 85 No. 98. Negotiations for the purchase of the several interests in the portion of these premises required for the widening of the thoroughfare, are in progress. No. 96. The copyhold interest, a life interest, a reversionary interest and a sub-leasehold interest in the strip required for widening the road, have been purchased by the Borough Council. In addition to acquiring the above interests, the Borough Council has to defray the cost of pulling down the front of the premises and rebuilding the same to the new line. The Broadway. In connection with this widening, necessitated by the proposed construction of the tramway between Putney and Harlesden, claims for compensation have been received from all persons interested in the premises required for the improvement, and negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of the several interests. Brook Green Road. All the leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, with one exception, in the property required for widening this road, necessitated by the proposed tramway from Putney to Harlesden, have now been acquired. Jeddo Road. The question of forming an easier and quicker route to Uxbridge Road from the neighbourhood of Jeddo Road and Stronsa Road has been under consideration. The Borough Surveyor reported that the best method to obtain this, from the point of view of economy in cost, was by continuing Jeddo Road parallel with Valetta Road into a new road communicating with Valetta Road. This scheme involves the taking of four 20 feet building plots, two in Hammersmith and two in Acton. Negotiations have been opened with the owner of these plots with a view to the acquisition of the same. Road to connect Wood Lane with Latimer Road. The Great Western Railway (New Lines) Bill contained proposals to construct various railways, two of which would 86 cross the land where it was proposed to construct the roadway to connect Wood Lane with Latimer Road. It was decided by the Borough Council to take such steps to obtain provisions inserted in the Bill to enable the proposed improvement to be carried out, and ultimately, the Great Western Railway Company agreed to give up so much land as is required to form the road to a width of 50 feet, and to dedicate the same to the public, to contribute towards the cost of construction of the road such a sum as would cover the extra cost involved in the construction thereof by reason of the construction of the railways and by reason of the alteration of the site of the proposed road from that originally contemplated by the Council, and also to contribute the sum of £1,770, which the trustees of the estate of Augustus Bird offered to contribute towards the expenses of constructing the road, and the Company to maintain the bridges over the railways. The Company also agreed to consent to the continuation of the proposed road under the West London Railway, and to use their endeavours to obtain a similar consent from the London and North Western Railway Company. The Bill containing these provisions was duly passed into law, and, so far, the Company have entered into possession of the land. Connection of Halsbury Road with Bloemfontein Road. A letter with petition signed by 250 residents in Ormiston Road and other streets in the vicinity, praying that steps might be taken to lengthen and continue Halsbury Road into Bloemfontein Road. The Borough Surveyor in reporting upon the matter, stated that he had made enquiries and found that the original plans for the laying out of the estate and which were approved by the County Council, shewed a communication between Halsbury Road and Bloemfontein Road. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners had reserved a strip of land a few inches in width, separating Bloemfontein Road from Halsbury Road, and that before the Commissioners would allow a communication to be made, they require to be paid for the strip. It therefore appeared that the County Council should insist upon the roadway being carried out in accordance with the approved plans, and the Borough Surveyor recommended that a communication be sent to the County Council, asking them to insist upon Halsbury Road being continued to Bloemfontein Road. 87 BOILER HOUSE.—ELECTRICITY WORKS. A third extension of the electric installation buildings, consisting of additions to the Boiler House, has been completed under the supervision of this department. The building is constructed of steel stancheons, with steel coal bunkers for the storage of 450 tons of coal over the firing space, the economisers being situated over the boilers. The sides of the structure are covered with corrugated iron. The roof over the boilers is of slate, and that over the coal bunkers, of corrugated iron, both roofs being provided with glass skylights. The contract, amounting to £2,248, was carried out by Messrs. Cross and Cross, of Walsall. ADDITIONS TO OFFICE BLOCK.—ELECTRICITY WORKS. In consequence of the growth of the Electricity undertaking the provision of additional office accommodation and a workshop at the works became necessary, and, in accordance with the instructions of the Electricity and Lighting Committee, the Borough Surveyor prepared and submitted plans and sections shewing the proposed additions and internal alterations to the Office block. The work entailed pulling down the existing Rectifier House and building over the space between the end of the unloading platform and the Office block, thus providing on the basement level a large Workshop and an Accumulator Room. At the Office Floor Level (access to which is gained by means of an iron staircase out of the workshop), an office for the Station Superintendent, Mess Room for Staff, and Arc Lamp Room have been provided. The internal alterations to the Office block consisted of utilising the two offices previously occupied by the Clerks, as private offices for the 88 Engineer and the Assistant Engineer respectively, the offices vacated by the Engineer and the Assistant Engineer being transferred to the Clerks. The middle entrance doorway has been bricked up and the existing wooden staircase removed, new concrete stairs over the existing entrance having been built, the space under the new stairs made into an additional strong room, a passageway under this new staircase being provided to give access to an additional Clerk's office. The office formerly occupied by the Station Superintendent is now used as the Chief Meter Inspector's office. On the First Floor Level, the position of the new staircase allowed of the offices being partitioned off, thus giving separate rooms to the Distributing Engineer and to the service men. All the new partitions are patent concrete partitions. A lodge has been erected, as it was found necessary to have an office at the entrance to the approach road to the electricity works, the object being to provide a proper place for booking materials in and out, and for preventing unauthorised persons gaining access to the works. Tenders were invited for executing the above work, and that of Messrs. F. and G. Foster, of South Norwood, was accepted, in the sum of £1,607. The work is nearing completion. DEPOT. In consequence of the acquisition of a portion of the Great Church Lane Depot by the District Railway . Company for the purpose of widening their line at Hammersmith Station, the boundary wall has been pulled down and a new wall built. Part of the Superintendent's residence and the yard adjoining has been underpinned and supported on girders, part of the yard extending over the station and forming the roof. 89 An oil store, to replace the one removed consequent upon the above work, has been built, the work being carried out by the Council's workmen. CHANCELLORS WHARF. To comply with the regulations of the Factory and Workshop Acts, a life-belt has been provided and kept at hand on the Wharf, and chains fixed along the river wall at high water level, and the Wharf lighted by electric arc lamps. ROSEBANK WHARF. The boundary fence on Holyport Road having become broken down, it has been replaced by a 9-in. brick wall with 18-in. piers at intervals along its length, with a gateway at each end. The work was carried out by direct labour under the supervision of this department, at a cost of £346 2s. 4d. Two new sets of hoisting gear for raising and lowering the dust shoots have been supplied and erected by The Chain and Pickering Hoist Co., Ltd. WENDELL PARK. The path across the park from Wendell Road to Cobbold Road, owing to its condition and the amount of traffic along it, has been tar-paved, at a cost of £82 5s. 3d. CEMETERY. The Council having decided to erect a greenhouse in the Cemetery for the purpose of propagating plants for the borders and also for sale, the Borough Surveyor was accordingly instructed to prepare the necessary drawings, specification and estimate. These were approved, and tenders invited for the work. That of 90 Messrs. Weekes and Co., of Fulham Road, S.W., being accepted, the contract, amounting to ,£308 10s. od., being duly carried out and completed. ROAD ROLLERS. On the report of the Engineer of the National Boiler Insurance Company, that the Council's road roller, No. 3,058, required overhauling, the Council gave instructions for the roller to be sent to the makers, Messrs. Aveling and Porter, of Rochester, for overhauling. The roller was purchased in 1892 and overhauled in 1898. The Borough Surveyor having reported that the wheels of the road roller, No. 4,717, required repairing or replacing, and that, considering the comparatively short time that the wheels had been in use, the attention of the makers should be drawn to the matter, who offered to supply a new pair of wheels at a special price of £28 net, delivered free on rails at Rochester. TOWN HALL RE-DECORATION. The work of painting the walls, ceilings, and varnishing the wood and ironwork of the large hall and gallery, Council chamber, main staircase and crush room and ladies' cloak room was carried out during August and September. Twenty-one tenders were received, and that of Messrs. J. Barker and Co., of Kensington, amounting to £238 10s. od., was accepted. In connection with this work an estimate of £32 10s. od. from the same firm was accepted, for making good a defect in the ventilating turret over the large hall. PROPOSED ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATION AT TOWN HALL. The Borough Surveyor presented the following report upon the question of additional accommodation for the Staff at the Town Hall:— 91 In accordance with your instructions, I have carefully considered this question, and herewith submit, first, a sketch plan shewing additional accommodation for the Borough Accountant's Department, Public Health Department, Committee Room, and for altering the offices at present used by these Departments to suit the requirements of the Town Clerk's Department; and secondly, sketch plans shewing how these proposed additions could be embodied in a general scheme for the future extension of the Town Hall. It is proposed that the new buildings should be erected 25 feet distant from the north end of the Town Hall, a subway being provided across this passageway so that the present conveniences may be used in connection with the new offices, and also for direct communication with the other Departments. The public entrance to the new buildings would be from Brook Green Road, and, commencing on the left, the offices are:— 1. Sanitary Inspectors. 2. Medical Officer of Health. 3. Sanitary Clerks. 4. Public Health Visitor (Lady). On the other side of the corridor will be:— 1. Accountant's Private Office. 2. Cashier. 3. Accountant's General Office. 4. Committee Room (18 feet by 21 feet). This arrangement will render vacant three offices, viz., Borough Accountant's, Public Health, and Medical Officer of Health, which can be utilised by the Town Clerk's Department. It is proposed to enlarge the Town Clerk's Private Office by reducing the size of the General Office adjoining, and by removing the wall at present dividing the safes, direct communication could be obtained from the Town Clerk's Private Office to the General Office. The Medical Officer of Health's present office could be used as the Burial Clerk's Office, and a new safe for the department provided in this office. It is not proposed to excavate the site or to provide basements except under the corridor, where it would be necessary for the storage of pipes, &c. The elevation for the new block would be similar to that of present Town Hall, carried up one storey in height, covered with fireproof flooring and temporarily roofed with asphalte; 92 the estimated cost of carrying out this portion of the work, with the passageway between the two blocks, is approximately, £3,500. It will be seen that it will be necessary to set back the line of the new buildings to the line of the Carnegie Library, so as to make a 50 feet roadway, in accordance with the London County Council Improvement line. The buildings first described have been designed so that they may form part of the General Scheme for the extension of the Town Hall, and sketch plans Nos. 2 and 3 shew that the following accommodation could then be provided:— Committee Room, Members' Room, New Suite of Offices for Town Clerk's Department, and Contractors' Room ; also a new Entrance Hall for the Large Hall with Cloak Rooms (ladies' and gentlemen's) adjoining main entrance, with Supper, Light Refreshments, Smoke Room and Chair Storage Rooms on first floor. Provision is also made for a Small Hall with Cloak Room accommodation on ground floor and Refreshment and Crush Rooms on first floor. TRAMWAYS. CONDITION OF TRACKS. In accordance with the recommendation of the Council, the Borough Surveyor submitted the following report upon the condition of the wood paving in various parts of the tramway routes within the Borough repairable by the London United Tramways, Limited: — In accordance with your instructions, I beg to report that I have carefully examined the tramway tracks along Uxbridge Road, Goldhawk Road, Glenthorne Road, Beadon Road, Studland Street and King Street, between the Broadway and Young's Corner, and beg to submit herewith a statement shewing the condition of the paving in the several roads. It will be seen from this statement that there are many places where the track is in a bad state of repair, and is a danger and annoyance to vehicular traffic. 93 An Act of Parliament was obtained by the London United Tramways Company in 1899, authorising the Company to work their Tramways by electrical or mechanical power. Under Section 11, sub-section 5, this work was to be executed under and to be subject to the provisions of Sections 26-33 the Tramway Act of 1870. Section 28 of the last-named Act requires that "the promoters shall, at their own expense, at all times maintain and keep in good condition and repair, with such jnaterials and in such manner as the road authority shall direct, and to their satisfaction, so much of any road whereon any tramway belonging to them is laid as lies between the rails of the tramway and (where two tramways are laid by the same promoters in any road at a distance of not more than four feet from each other) the portion of the road between the tramways, and in every case so much of the road as extends eighteen inches "beyond the rails of and on each side of any such tramway." Section 33 provides that "If any difference arises between the promoters and the road authority with respect to the propriety of or the mode of execution of any work relating to any tramway The matter in difference shall be settled by an engineer or other fit person nominated as referee by the Board of Trade on the application of either party, and the expenses of the reference shall be borne and paid as the referee directs." The attention of the Tramways Company has frequently been called to the defective condition of the various tramway tracks, and although some work has been carried out, the track remains in the condition as set out. I would therefore recommend that before any legal steps are taken, a notice be served upon the Tramway Company to put their tracks in good condition and repair to the satisfaction of the Council. This report was approved by the Council, and a notice served upon the Company requiring them to put into good condition and repair such parts of the several roads as are mentioned in the statement accompanying the Borough Surveyor's report. Since the notice was served the Company has carried out a number of repairs to the tracks, and are continuing to do so. 94 COAL PLATES. During the year twenty-two 12-in. and three 14-in. coal plates have been supplied and fixed at the cost of the owners or occupiers of the houses. The following are the charges :— Price Cutting with hole Total. Rim. in stone. s. d. s. d. s. d a. 12-in. plain or perforated plate4626 70 b. 14-in. plain or perforated plate 58 26 82 SEWERS. The length of main trunk sewers in the parish is 9 miles 7 furlongs 91 yards. The length of sewers under the jurisdiction of the Council is 11 miles 86 yards of brick, and 24 miles 6 furlongs 86 yards of pipe sewers, the total being-: — Brick. Miles. Fur. Yds. 20 7 177 Pipe. Miles. Fur. Yds. 24 6 86 Total. Miles. Fur. Yds. 45 6 43 SEWER—GREAT CHURCH LANE. This sewer where it passes under the District Railway has been reconstructed by the Company, this being necessitated by the widening of the line, and further, from the fact that the old sewer had burst on one occasion. Apparently, at the time when the line was made, there was a probability of the sewer being extended northwards, and the sewer was therefore built in duplicate under the line, but as no such extension seemed probable and the sewer only received the drainage from one 12-in. pipe on the north side of the line, it was considered that one cast-iron pipe, 27 inches in diameter, would prove amply sufficient for the future. 95 SEWER—WINGATE ROAD. The sewer at the south end of this road being in a defective condition, was relaid. The new sewer has been connected to the one in Dalling Road, a better fall being thus obtained. The old sewer discharged into the Paddenswick Road sewer. STORM RELIEF SEWER. The construction of the low level storm relief sewer from Hammersmith to Bow has been commenced by the London County Council's Works Department at several points along its route through the Borough. For the greater part of its length in this district, the sewer is 6 feet in diameter, but for a short length it is 5 feet. The scheme includes a new sewer, 4 feet in diameter, along Devonport Road, connecting the Acton branch sewer in Uxbridge Road to the new relief sewer in Goldhawk Road. The sewer is being constructed in open cutting. The invert is of blue brick, the remainder being of 9-in. gault wire-cut bricks surrounded with 6-in. Portland cement concrete of square section. The commencement of the sewer is in Stamford Brook Road, near St. Mary's Church, and the route followed is along Goldhawk Road to The Grove, along this latter thoroughfare to Richford Street, along Richford Street under the London and South Western Railway, and also the Hammersmith and City Railway, then along Batoum Gardens to Shepherd's Bush Road, through Shepherd's Bush Road to the north side of Brook Green, along Brook Green to Hammersmith Road, Hammersmith Road and under the West London Railway at Addison Bridge, Russell Gardens to Warwick Road. At a number of points the existing local sewers may be connected to the new one by penstock chambers 96 and weirs so that in time of heavy rainfall the local sewers will be relieved of the excessive and varying quantities of storm water, which they are at present called upon to carry away, and thus it is hoped that the new sewer will remove the cause of the flooding of basements which many of the houses and premises in the Borough are now subjected to. SEWER VENTILATORS. The following is a list of sewer ventilators with their positions. In most of the cases they are connected to the sewer in the road, carried up and attached to the wall of a building adjoining. POSITION. TYPE OF SHAFT.

The suggestion made by the Borough Surveyor of Lewisham as a partial mitigation of the nuisance is that the sewer ventilators, which are flush with the surface of the roadway, should be put much closer together; and also that efforts should be made by combined action of the Borough .Councils to obtain the repeal of the above By-law, and that every house should have a ventilating pipe from the highest point of the drain to act as a ventilator to the sewer. As regards the recommendation that the sewer ventilators should be placed much closer together with a view of providing additional fresh air inlets to the sewers; this appears to be desirable, and would considerably improve the air in the sewers. The suggestion to do away with the intercepting trap and to make the ventilating shaft of the house drain an outlet for sewer gas, I do not agree with, as the result would be that the only protection against the entrance of sewer air into the houses would be the trap of the water-closets, and if these were to become unsealed, the public sewers would be ventilating directly into the houses. My experience has been that, when the manhole covers are open to allow them to act as fresh air inlets, and an efficient system of ventilating shafts fixed to the fronts of the houses to act as outlets, the air in the sewers can be kept comparatively pure. The efficiency of this natural ventilation varies somewhat on account of the variation of the temperature in the sewer and in the outer air. I cannot see that the owners of property should be called upon to run the risk of getting sewer gas into their premises for the sake of ventilating the public sewer. I think, undoubtedly, that the sewers should be Tentilated at the expense of the Local Authority, and that the ventilation for public sewers should be separate from private drains, but the ventilators might be taken from the sewer side of the intercepting trap on private drains. 98 I am of opinion that if the Local Authority had power to compel owners of property, when building, to erect outlet shafts, and there were a sufficient number of them provided in convenient situations, the sewers in the district would be properly ventilated. The sewers in the following roads have been re-laid, or partly re-laid, during the year, at the cost shewn:— £ s. d. Ashchurch Terrace 56 3 4 Anley Road 44 4 8 Banim Street 26 4 0 Hampshire Hog Lane 16 18 1 Stowe Road 25 2 11 Wingate Road 15 3 3 Wellesley Avenue and Wingate road 79 13 5 GULLIES. Five additional stoneware gullies have been fixed and the connections made to the sewers in the various new streets taken to by the Council. Twenty-seven have been fixed by the Council's workmen in different roads in the Borough where new channel has been laid, and also where it has been found difficult to drain the water when re-laying the channelling. The gullies are cleansed regularly in the summer once every month and flushed with water, and in winter once every six weeks. Three horses and carts, with men, have been employed 307 days removing 2,617 loads of soil. In dry weather during the summer two water carts are employed filling the gullies with water mixed with disinfectant. MANHOLES. Fifteen new manholes have been built, and two new ones have been built in the new streets taken to by the Council. Twenty-seven sheet-iron plates have been fixed under manhole covers from time to time where complaints have been received as to sewer emanations. 99 PRIVATE DRAINS. In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120, sec. 76, and with the Council's regulations, applications and plans have been submitted to, and approved by, the Works Committee, and subsequently sanctioned by the Council for the drainage of 428 new houses, shops, &c., 8 schools, 8 factories, 3 stables, 3 railway arches, 2 chapels, 1 block of flats, 1 theatre, 1 railway station, 1 exhibition ground. The drains are laid in accordance with the deposited plan, and in every case the Drainage Inspector tests the pipes before they are covered in. During the year 1905-6, the Council's workmen have laid and connected 178 drains from the back line of the footpath to the sewers and unstopped 8 house drains. The amount deposited to meet the cost of same was £1,127 os. 6d., paid in from time to time to the Borough Accountant, and with the balance left in hand on the 31st March, 1905, viz., ,£133 16s. od., amounted to ,£1,260 16s. 6d. The" actual cost of the work carried out was ,£1,002 9s. 5d., the surplus amounting to ,£131 6s. iod., which, after being reported to the Finance Committee, was returned to the respective depositors, leaving a balance of .£127 os. 3d., being mostly in respect of uncompleted works.

Before a licence is granted, a deposit to cover the cost of re-instatement is required, and any balance remaining after completion of this work is returned to the licensee. ARRANGEMENTS IN THE EVENT OF A FALL OF SNOW. In the early part of the winter the usual application was made to the Thames Conservancy for permission to 121 shoot clean snow in the River Thames at certain points, in the event of a downfall, and permission was granted to the Council upon certain conditions. For the purpose of quickly and effectually clearing the streets after a snowstorm, the Borough is divided into 40 sub-districts, with a competent man selected from the ordinary staff of the Council in charge of a gang for each district, each ganger is furnished with printed instructions, and a list of the streets and parts of streets within the sub-districts under his control. Preparation is therefore made for carrying out the work simultaneously in all parts of the Borough. GAS, WATER, &c., TRENCHES. The various Gas, Water and Telephone Companies, Post Office Telegraph and Telephone Departments, and the Council's Electricity Department have taken up the surface of the roadways and footways in 1,649 places, representing an area of 12,644 superficial yards, which was subsequently made good by the Council's workmen, the expense of repairs, amounting to ,£2,035 12S. 3d., being charged to the several companies and departments. The following Table shews the number of trenches opened and re-instated by the Council, and the amount paid by the various Companies for the same during the years 1904-5 and 1905-6. YEAR.

The Borough Surveyor reported to the Council upon the condition of the street name plates within the Borough, shewing that 158 new name plates were required and 32 required painting. The new plates, which are of non-rusting metal, have been fixed in suitable positions. FIRE ALARM INDICATORS. The question of the desirability of making known the position of fire alarms has been considered by the Borough Council on the suggestion of the County Council. After considering the matter the Borough Council agreed that if the County Council would supply the necessary number of indicators the Borough Council would undertake to fix the indicators to the lamp columns nearest the fire alarms in the Borough, and to maintain the indicators and paint them as often as may be necessary. UNIVERSITY BOAT RACE, 1906. The Council in accordance with the usual practice, granted permission for the wharves to be utilized by the Burgesses for the purpose of viewing the above race. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. MAIR, m.i.c.e., Borough Surveyor. 125 Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health OF THE borough of hammersmith For the Year 1905. 127 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH For the Year 1905. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hammersmith. March 25th, 1906. Gentlemen—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. The Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Council during the 52 weeks ending on December 30th, 1905. A new table of deaths of infants under one year of age is added to this Report in accordance with a direction of the Local Government Board. The deaths of non-Residents have been deducted, and the deaths of Residents occurring in other parts of London have been added, as heretofore. Deaths of persons occurring in institutions receiving sick and infirm persons have alone been regarded for the purpose of correction. 128 BIRTHS. During last year 3,110 births were registered in this Borough against 3,146 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 188 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 119,037 inhabitants, the number of births registered was equal to an annual rate of 26'1 births per 1,000 persons living. The birth-rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year, i.e., 4,684,794 inhabitants, was equal to an annual rate of 27. 1 births per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS. During last year 1,419 deaths were registered in this Borough, against 1,632 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of deaths registered in this Borough last year was 314 below the average number registered during the previous 10 years. Adding 385 deaths of Residents of this Borough, which took place in general hospitals and other public institutions in other Boroughs of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 161 deaths of non-Residents which occurred, 141 at the West London Hospital and 20 at Nazareth House, the corrected number of deaths of Residents registered last year was 1,643. On the before-mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of Residents, registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 13.8 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 15.1 deaths per 1,000 persons living. 129 DEATHS OF INFANTS. The corrected number of deaths of Residents under one year of age registered was 414 against 474 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 252 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered, and to 133 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 232 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and 131 per 1,000 of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was, as compared with the total deaths of Residents registered, 20 per 1,000, and, as compared with the total births registered, 2 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The very small difference between the deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births registered and the same deaths in London is only what might reasonably be expected upon taking into consideration the social condition of a large proportion of the inhabitants in the Borough. The considerable difference between deaths of infants in this Borough per 1,000 deaths registered as compared with the same deaths in London is accounted for by the much lower general death rate in this Borough than in London. The following table on infantile mortality has been prepared by me in accordance with the direction of the Local Government Board. 130 TABLE I. Infantile Mortality during the year 1905.

Births in the Year: Legitimate, 3,037; Illegitimate, 73. Deaths from all Causes at all Ages, 1,643. 131 DEATHS OF AGED PERSONS. The corrected number of deaths of Residents at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 497 against 477 in the previous year. These deaths last year were equal to 4 2 per 1,000 of the total persons living, and 303 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered. The deaths of persons registered at 60 years of age and upwards in London last year was equal to 4'5 per 1,000 of the total persons living, and 291 per 1,000 of the total deaths in London registered. This death-rate was, therefore, '3 per 1,000 less in this Borough than in London as compared with the total persons living, and 12 per 1,000 less in this Borough than in London as compared with the total deaths registered. 132 TABLE II.

Block 1 may, if desired, be used for the whole district; and blocks 2,3, &c., for the several localities. In small districts without recognised divisions of known population this Table need not be filled up. (b) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions beyond the district are to be included in sub-columns c of this Table, and those of esidents registered in public institutions in the district excluded. (See note on Table II. as to meaning of terms “resident” and “nonresident.” (c) Deaths of residents occurring in public institutions, whether within or without the district, are to be allotted to the respective localities according to the addresses of the deceased. (d) Care should be taken that the gross totals of the several columns in this Table respectively equal the corresponding totals for the whole districts in Tables II. and V.: thus, the totals of sub-columns a, 6, and c should agree with the figures for the year in the columns 2, 3, and 12, respectively, of Table II. : the gross total of the sub-columns c should agree with the total of column 2 in Table V., and the gross total of sub-columns d with the total of column 3 in Table V. 134 Table shewing the Death Rates from All Causes in the County of London, the City of London, and the Metropolitan Boroughs during the 52 weeks of 1905, as calculated by the Registrar-General.

They are also, in columns 9-11, to be included among the deaths in their respective "Localities" according to the previous addresses of deceased as given by the Registrars. Deaths of "Non-Residents" occurring in public institutions in the district are in like manner to be excluded from columns 2-8 and 9-11 of this Table. (b) See notes on Table II. as to the meaning of "Residents" and " Non- Residents," and as to the " Public Institutions " to be taken into account for the purposes of these Tables. The "Localities" should be the same as those in Tables II. and III. (c) All deaths occurring in public institutions situated within the district, whether of "Residents" or of "Non-Residents," are, in addition to be dealt with as in note (a), to be entered in the last column of this Table. The total number in this column should equal the figures for the year in column 9, Table II. (d) The total deaths in the several "Localities" in columns 9-II of this Table should equal those for the year in the same localities in Table II., sub-columns c. The total deaths at all ages in column 2 of this Table should equal the gross total of columns 9-II, and the figures for the year in column 12 of Table II. (e) Under the heading of "Diarrhoea" are to be included deaths certified as from diarrhoea, alone or in combination with some other cause of ill-defined nature; and also deaths certified as from Epidemic enteritis; Zymotic enteritis; Epidemic diarrhoea. Summer diarrhœa; Dysentery and dysenteric diarrhoea ; Choleraic diarrhoea, choler , cholera nostras (in the absence of Asiatic cholera). Under the heading of " Enteritis " are to be included those certified as from Gastro-enteritis, Muco-enteritis, and Gastric catarrh, unless from information obtained by enquiry from the certifying practitioner or otherwise, the Medical Officer of Health should have reason for including such deaths, especially those of infants, under the specific term "Diarrhoea." Deaths from diarrhoea secondary to some other well-defined disease should be included under the latter. Under the headings of "Cancer" and "Puerperal fever" should be included all registered deaths from causes comprised within ' these general terms. In recording the facts under the various headings of Tables II., III, IV, and V. attention has been given to the notes on the Tables. N. C COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. March 25th, 1906 138 DEATHS FROM THE NINE PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of Residents that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases was 210 against 298 in the previous year. The deaths of Residents last year from these diseases were equal to 128 per 1,000 of the total deaths of Residents registered, and were at the rate of i'8 deaths per 1,000 persons living. The deaths from the nine principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 112 per 1,000 of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 1.7 deaths per 1,000 persons living. These deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of Residents registered, 16 greater per 1,000 deaths registered in this Borough than in London, and as compared with the population 0.1 per 1,000 greater in this Borough than in London. The large number of deaths from whooping cough, 54 last year against only 32 in the previous year, was the cause of the deaths from these zymotic diseases being in excess of the average for London. The following table shews the deaths of Residents registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the 10 years 1896 to 1905. YEAR. Small-Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria and Membraneous Croup. Whooping Cough. Typhus fever. Enteric Fever. Simple Continued Fever. Diarrhœa and Cholera.

There were, omitting phthisis, 776 cases reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Borough against 654 in the previous year. There were also 109 cases of phthisis voluntarily notified. There were also reported 922 cases of infectious diseases that were not notifiable, against 921 in the previous year, 219 of these were chicken-pox, 417 measles, and 286 whooping cough. SMALL-POX. No case of small-pox was notified in the Borough last year, against no case in the previous year. CHICKEN-POX. Two hundred and nineteen cases of chicken-pox were reported, against 283 cases in the previous year. The 219 cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. No death was registered. MEASLES. Four hundred and seventeen cases were reported as due to measles, against 742 cases in the previous year. Thirty deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as no doubt only a proportion of the cases which occurred were known of by me, but owing to the stringent instructions of the Educational Department of the London County Council most of the cases occurring among pupils at the schools were reported to me. A strict system of disinfection was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1901. The London County Council having wisely declared the complaint to be a dangerous infectious disease. 140 From the whole of the notifiable infectious diseases there were only 42 deaths, whereas from measles alone there were 30 deaths. Judging from the total results, measles was, as usual, the most dangerous infectious disease affecting the public health of the Borough. In each of the cases that was reported the premises were at once inspected as to the sanitary condition. SCARLET FEVER. Three hundred and sixty cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 283 in the previous year. Three hundred and eight cases reported last year were isolated at Isolation Hospitals, and 52 cases were treated at the homes of the patients. Eleven deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was only 3.1 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. Two hundred and thirty-seven cases were reported as due to diphtheria or diphtheritic membranous croup, against 201 cases in the previous year. Two hundred and eighteen cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals, and 19 at the homes of the patients. Twenty-one deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 8 9 per cent. WHOOPING COUGH. Two hundred and eighty-six cases were reported as due to whooping cough, against 102 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. Fifty-four deaths were registered. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as doubtless a very large number of cases occurred which were not known of in the Public Health Department. 141 Though, as in the case of measles, owing to the strict instructions of the Educational Department of the London County Council, a much larger proportion of cases were reported to me. ENTERIC FEVER. Forty-one cases were reported as due to enteric fever, against 38 in the previous year. Fourteen of the cases reported last year were treated at the Isolation Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Five deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 12.2 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. No case was reported as due to typhus fever, against no case in the previous year. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. No case was reported as due to simple continued fever, against one case in the previous year. RELAPSING FEVER. No case was reported as due to relapsing fever, against no case in the previous year. PUERPERAL FEVER. Thirteen cases were reported as due to puerperal fever, against 11 cases in the previous year. Five of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. Seven cases were treated at the Fulham Infirmary, and one at the West London Hospital. Seven deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 53 8 per cent. 142 CHOLERA. No case was reported as due to cholera, against no case in the previous year. ERYSIPELAS. One hundred and twenty-five cases were reported last year as due to erysipelas, against 120 cases in the previous year. Six deaths were registered. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 4 8 per cent. PLAGUE. No case was reported as due to plague, against no case in the previous year. The following table shews the number of cases that were reported as due to the undermentioned 14 zymotic diseases during the years 1896 to 1905. Year. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever.

Twelve deaths were registered as due to influenza, against 13 deaths in the previous year. No official action was taken in reference to this complaint, as no application was made for the disinfection of any of the houses in which death had occurred. PHTHISIS. The voluntary notification of phthisis, which your Council decided upon on 7th April, 1902, was continued during last year. Altogether, 109 cases were notified to me against 143 cases in the previous year. These, no doubt, represent only a small proportion of the cases that actually occurred, as 172 deaths were registered, against 165 deaths in the previous year. In all cases notified or in which death occurred, the premises were at once inspected, and after death in all cases occurring in private dwelling houses an offer was made to disinfect the premises at the expense of your Council. In every case a printed instruction as to the course that should be adopted for the prevention of consumption was left at the premises. In many instances advantage was taken of the offer of your Council to disinfect. COUNCIL'S DUST SHOOT AT THE WHARF CHANCELLORS. During the last year no complaint was made of a nuisance from the depositing of the refuse at your Council's wharf. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 12 licensed slaughter houses in the Borough were under regular fortnightly inspection by the Inspector for offensive trades. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1905, I had 146 received notices that 12 licences were to be applied for. All of them were found to be, as far as your Council's requirements were concerned, in a satisfactory condition. Your Council decided to inform the London County Council that you offered no opposition to the renewal of any of the licences, and at the Special Sessions at the London County Council, held in October, the 12 licences were granted. The following is a list of the licensed slaughter houses in the Borough:— NORTH DISTRICT. Wards Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7. ADDRESS.

The whole of the 58 bakehouses in the Borough were under a regular half-yearly inspection by the Factory Inspector. Ninety-eight defects were discovered upon the premises during the year. Notices were at once served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Council. In each case the notice was complied with. It was not decided to apply for any summonses against bakers whose bakehouses were found not to be in conformity with the Act, as they readily complied with the requirements of your Council when called upon by notice to do so.

During the year 32 applications were received for certificates under these Acts. There was a very considerable amount of work which had to be carried out in reference to these applications. In no case was the certificate granted until the whole of the sanitary requirements were carried out so as to place the premises in a proper condition.

During last year no seizure was made of food which was unsound, unwholesome and unfit for the food of man. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. During the last year the Public Health Committee gave directions for the registration of 348 " houses let in lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family," making a total with those previously ordered to be registered of 2,577 premises. Upon the registration 156 a copy of the By-laws of your Council under which such houses are registered, was forwarded to the landlord (within the meaning of the By-laws) for his guidance. From various causes 311 houses have been removed from the list, leaving a total number now on the Register of 2,266. During the year 242 notices were served and 238 were complied with. The registered premises were visited as often as time would allow by the special Inspector appointed for that purpose. There can be no doubt that the official influence obtained by the registration of premises has a very good effect in improving the sanitary condition of the dwellings. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 2,134 notices were reported as having been served by your four District Sanitary Inspectors and by your house-to-house Inspector, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 2,076 in the previous year, and during last year 2,018 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 1,956 in the previous year. The House-to-House Inspection has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 3,723 houses and other premises in the borough, against 3,424 houses in the previous year. As the result of his inspection defects were discovered in 882 houses, and 882 Intimation Notices were served by the House-to-House Inspector. These cases were subsequently dealt with by the four District Inspectors. Three hundred and forty-two houses coming under the provisions of the By-laws as to " Houses let in 157 lodgings or occupied by the members of more than one family" were discovered by this Inspector, and were subsequently dealt with by the Inspector in charge of the work under the By-laws. Your Factory Inspector has during the year served 245 notices under the Factory and Workshop Act, and during the same period 241 notices have been complied with. During the previous year there were 233 notices served and 229 complied with.

The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which came into operation on the 1st November, 1902, by Part VIII. made provision for the regulation, manufacture, and sale of ice cream or other similar commodities. The duty of obtaining the necessary information for the registration of premises upon which ice creams are made has been carried out as heretofore by Sanitary Inspector S. Huggons Brown. At the present time there are 172 premises upon the register and 24 notices have been served, all of which have been complied with. Sanitary Inspector S. Huggons Brown, besides having charge of the work appertaining to ice cream dealers, supervises the duties which were transferred from the London County Council in reference to the registration of premises where milk is stored or sold; also cowsheds, slaughter-houses and offensive trades. The following is a table in reference to the abovenamed premises. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDER, &c. PROCEEDINGS DURING I905. PREMISES: NUMBER OF PLACES— Number of inspections, 1905.

During the year one case of infectious disease occurred upon premises where milk was sold. The regulations under the above Order appertaining to the stoppage of sale of milk, disinfection, and the granting of certificates thereafter were strictly enforced under my directions by the Officer carrying out the transferred duties. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Council and the Public Health Committee gave authority for 13 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of notices which had been served. In most cases before summonses were issued a letter was written to the person in default, informing him that the Public Health Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he was willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In 11 instances the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply for a summons. It has been the object of the department, as heretofore, to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Council. During last year two summonses were taken out through the Public Health Department. The following is a statement as to the nature of the complaint and the result of the proceedings:— 163 SUMMONSES. Situation of Premises. Nature of Offence. Result of Proceedings.

Complaint of a Public Nuisance from Axton's brickfield, situated at the north end of Adelaide Road. The case was reported upon by me, and had the careful consideration of your Public Health Committee. SMOKE ABATEMENT.

During the year 159 samples were examined and of these 101 were found to be genuine, 19 genuine but of inferior quality, and 39 adulterated. The percentage of adulterated samples was therefore 24.5 and of inferior samples 12. Most of the adulterated butters contained Fat other than Butter Fat, the percentage being as follows:— 80 to 90 per cent. 6 samples 70 to 80 „ ,, 17,, 50 to 60 ,, „ 9 ,, 43 ,, ,, 1 ,, 7.5 ,, ,, 1 ,, Three samples of Margarine were purchased under the Acts, and of these one contained the maximum of 16 per cent. of water, whilst in another as much as 17.8 per cent., i.e., an excess of 1.8 per cent was present. COFFEE AND COCOA. Twenty samples in all were examined, and a specimen of Coffee was reported as containing 70 per cent. of Chicory. PRESERVED PEAS. Six samples were examined and three of these were found to contain small quantities of Sulphate of Copper added to maintain a green tint. The amounts present were, however, very small, and in no case exceeded the equivalent of 2 grains of crystalised Sulphate of Copper to the pound. RICE. Several samples of Rice have been submitted to me under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts this year, and the relatively high proportion of mineral matter in some cases, together with the fact that a substantial amount of this was insoluble in hydrochloric acid, plainly indicated that some inorganic substance foreign to rice was present. In order to ascertain the nature of this addition, many samples of known origin were purchased and analysed, the mineral matter being specially examined qualitatively and quantitatively. The following table shews the results obtained:— 174 TABLE V. Samples of Known Origin. Rice. Price. Finish. Total Ash. Insoluble Ash. Residual Ash. Carolina 6d.

The chemical examination of the extraneous mineral matter shewed it to consist of a crude magnesium silicate similar in composition to French Chalk, Steatite, or Talc. From experiments made in the laboratory it was ascertained that this surface polish could be almost entirely removed by washing, but at the same time it must be admitted that the process is absolutely unnecessary, inasmuch as there are other methods not open to the same objection and, moreover, there is no reason, apart from the whims of certain purchasers why the grains should not be left with their natural surface, as indeed is the practice of some of the chief rice-eating nations, notably Japan. Milk and Butter are again the articles most seriously adulterated. The percentage of adulteration for the year in the case of Milk was 8.8, compared with 9.2 for the preceding year. In the case of Butter the percentage of adulteration again shews an increase, reaching the figure of 24.5 as compared with 13.7 for last year. The percentage of adulteration calculated from the Local Government Board Returns for the whole Metropolis for the year 1904 was 12.5 per cent. in the case of Milk and 8.2 per cent. for Butter. In addition to the articles taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, I have examined one sample of Water and two samples of Carbolic Powder submitted by the Borough Surveyor.

Electricity Works, 85 Fulham Palace Road, W. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen, I have pleasure in reporting upon the working of the Electricity Department during the year ending 31st March, 1906:— This year has been the most eventful in the history of the Undertaking owing to the fact that the capacity of the plant has been more than doubled, the price has been reduced to a low flat rate, and several important new contracts for the supply of current have been entered into. NUMBER OF CONSUMERS. Very satisfactory progress has been made in this direction, the installations connected shewing an increase of 241 over last year's returns. Total installations connected at end of year. Total connected during year. Disconnected during year. No. 8 c.p. No. 8 c.p. No. 8 c.p. 1818 112,122 410 26,305 160 6,624 The units sold per 8 c.p. lamp were 39, compared with 32 for the previous year. UNITS SOLD. 3,644,146 units were sold compared with 2,948,633 for the year 1904-5, an increase of 695,513 units. 1,749,218 or 48 per cent. were used for private lighting 1,400,135 or 38 per cent. were used for power 494,793 or 14 per cent. were used for public lighting 3,644,146 100 per cent. 180 A most satisfactory feature is the large increase in the quantity of electricity sold for power purposes, which, of course, means that more current is being generated during the daytime, and also that the new scale of charges is having the desired effect of inducing manufacturers to adopt electricity for driving their machinery in place of steam or gas. The private lighting also shews a very satisfactory increase, doubtless due to the abolition of the maximum demand system, and the reduced flat rate of 3d. per unit. MAXIMUM DEMAND. The maximum demand upon the Generating Station was 3,297 k.w. on 21st November, 1905 (during the period of the Exhibition at Olympia. This, of course, was an exceptional load, the maximum demand under ordinary circumstances being 2,503 k.w. on 21st December, 1905. AVERAGE PRICE For all current sold to private consumers. This continues to decrease, the average for the past three years being as follows:— 1903-4 3.43d. per unit 1904-5 2.94d „ „ 1905-6 2.32d. ,, „ The greater portion of the output was sold at the reduced rates, hence the decrease in the average price. POWER SUPPLY. The continued advance in the use of electricity for driving machinery is a most gratifying feature. At March, 1905, we had 180 motors of 1,208 horse-power, but we now have 229 motors of 1,420 horse-power connected to the mains, an increase during the year of 49 motors of 212 horsepower. I may here add that there are a number of factories in Hammersmith where our supply has entirely superceded gas and steam engines, and we have not had a single complaint, which goes far to prove that electricity is the b.est and most economical form of power. CHARGES FOR CURRENT. One of the most important events of the year has been the reduction in the charge for electricity for both lighting 181 and power. From 30th September, 1905, current has been supplied for lighting at a flat rate of 3d. per unit, whilst for power the price was reduced to 1½d. per unit, less discounts, varying to a maximum of 33 per cent. according to the amount of current used. DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. Various extensions of mains have been carried out during the year, the most important being the special cables laid from the Works to Duncane Road, in order to supply the new Workhouse and Infirmary, and additional high tension mains laid in order to meet the increased demand at Olympia. The following is a complete list of the streets in which new mains have been laid:— Aldbourne Road Blomfield Road Duncane Road Girdlers Road Godolphin Road Hythe Road (extension) Jeddo Road Lower Mall Olympia Sedgeford Road St. Peter's Square Wood Lane OLYMPIA. An agreement has been entered into with the New Olympia Co. to take the whole of the supply required at Olympia from the Council for a period of seven years. The supply under this contract is very large, being 972 kilowatts, whilst 148,645 units were sold during the Electrical and Motor Car Exhibitions alone. SUBSTATIONS. Owing to the increase in the demand for electricity, at various points it has been necessary to build and equip six new Substations, which have been erected beneath the public footpaths in the following thoroughfares:— Ashchurch Terrace Aldbourne Road Bridge Road Hazlitt Road Netherwood Road St. Stephen's Avenue These are now in working order, and in consequence the pressure at consumers' terminals is steadily maintained. 182 PUBLIC LIGHTING. In my last Annual Report, I mentioned that a circuit of rectified arcs had been converted to alternating current as an experiment, and that if this proved satisfactory, it was proposed to convert the whole of the lamps, as the trouble through breakdowns on the rectified circuits was entailing serious expense and inconvenience. I am pleased to say that this experiment proved very satisfactory, and it was decided to proceed with the work of converting the whole of the public lamps. The actual alterations to the lamps, including supplying all the necessary switchboards, choking coils, substitutional resistances, additional domes, &c., was carried out by Messrs. The Universal Electric Manufacturing Co., of Peckham, but the refixing, changing, and altering the circuits have been done by the Council's own workmen. The work has been carried out satisfactorily, and the lamps give a better light, and it is important to note that not a single lamp was out any evening during the reconstruction. The immunity from breakdown will soon cover the cost of these alterations. COSTS. As the result of the year's working our Works costs have been reduced by 11.2 per cent. to .7926. per unit, and the total costs to 1.096d. per unit. This department continues to be one of the most successful and economical Supply Undertakings working in the Metropolitan area. The following tables shew the comparison between the two years cost per unit in detail, a reduction being shewn in practically every department over which the staff have any control. Per unit. 1905-6. Coal £5,593= .368d. Oil, Water and Petty Stores 537= 035d. Wages 2,948= .194d. Repairs 1,947= .127d. Distribution £2,943 Refunded 1,909 1,033= .o68d. Works costs 12,058= .792d.

Undoubtedly the most important work during the year under review has been the installation of the two new turboalternators, and the three Davey Paxman dry-back boilers. In my last report I gave full particulars of the contracts for the plant, and as these extensions are now practically completed, the following figures of the actual cost are interesting:— Particulars.

It is with great regret that I report that a fatal accident occurred in the Generating Station on the 4th November, 1905. Mr. A. Boswell, Junior Engineer-in-Charge, and rectifier attendant, unfortunately came in contact with a "live" busbar on the high tension distributing board, and received a fatal shock. This was not only very sad in itself, but especially so as Mr. Boswell has shewn himself to be an extremely energetic and promising assistant. 184 CONCLUSION. In conclusion, I would mention that the year under review has been the most successful in the history of the undertaking. The total revenue expenditure has been £21,002, an increase of £2,089 over the previous year, whilst the revenue (notwithstanding the fact that the greater portion of the current was sold at the reduced rates) actually shews an increase over the previous year of £179.

GILBERT BELL, Borough Electrical Engineer. 185 Annual Report OF THE Chief Librarian For the Year ended 31st March, 1906. 187 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF LIBRARIAN. To the Libraries Committee, Borough of Hammersmith. Gentlemen, The past year will be memorable in the history of the Public Libraries of Hammersmith, it having witnessed the completion and opening of the new Central Library, built chiefly through the generosity of Dr. Andrew Carnegie. The result of this splendid addition to the Libraries of the Borough has so far been satisfactory ; all departments have been well used, but the issue in the Reference Library is the most encouraging feature, and it is hoped that this most valuable department of the Library will receive greater attention from the public in the future than has been the case hitherto. It was decided to remove the majority of the books in the Reference Library at Ravenscourt Park to the new building, and the increased accommodation has already attracted a large number of readers. The issue in this department for 154 days reached 11,462 volumes, an average of 74 per day. The stock at the present time numbers 6,024 volumes, 173 having been added during the year. At Ravenscourt Park the Reference issue was 2,254 volumes, and at Shepherd's Bush 8,492, an average of 27 per day. The total number of volumes referred to in all the Libraries was 22,208, a number much greater than that of any previous year. LENDING DEPARTMENTS. The number of volumes in the Lending Departments of the four Libraries is 35,186, which are 188 distributed as follows:—Carnegie, 11,178; Ravenscourt Park, 12,151; Shepherd's Bush, 11,039; College Park, 818. At the Annual Stocktaking, 747 volumes were withdrawn and 119 of this number have been replaced. Six volumes were lost from the Lending Library at Ravenscourt Park, and one from Shepherd's Bush. Three volumes were stolen from the Reference Department and six from the Boys' Room of the same Library, making a total of 16 volumes lost. The issues at Ravenscourt Park and Shepherd's Bush shew a slight falling off compared with last year, but this is due to the fact that the Central Library was opened in January last. The total number issued was 213,642, distributed as follows:—Carnegie, 21,896; Ravenscourt Park, 79,723; Shepherd's Bush, 107,572; College Park, 4,451. New tickets were issued to 4,193 borrowers as under:—Carnegie, 1,796; Ravenscourt Park, 914; Shepherd's Bush, 1,438; College Park, 45. In addition, 784 non-fiction tickets were granted, making a total of 4,977. The number of tickets cancelled was 335, and the approximate number now in force is 8,248. BINDING AND REPAIRS. The number of books rebound and recased was 1,946; Carnegie, 583; Ravenscourt Park, 413; Shepherd's Bush, 950. The Staff has also repaired 5,165 volumes: 148 at the Central; 3,877 at Ravenscourt Park; 1,140 at Shepherd's Bush. The large number repaired at Ravenscourt Park is an indication that the wear and tear of 16 years is affecting the condition of the stock very considerably, and it will be necessary to replace a large number of volumes at the next stocktaking. 189 GIFTS. In addition to some very valuable gifts to the Carnegie Library which are acknowledged in their proper place, the Committee has received from various donors a large number of books, for which it desires to express its thanks. Certain of these gifts deserve to be specially mentioned. Mr. F. G. Stephens presented 71 volumes, including a set of "The Building News," and Mr. W. Mills gave 115 volumes, amongst which were many works by standard authors. The Harleian Society gave 33 volumes of its Registers and Visitations. LECTURES. The Committee was fortunate in securing the services of four able lecturers for the Free Lectures in the Town Hall. On January 15th, Mr. Carl Armbruster, Musical Adviser to the London County Council, gave an excellent discourse on Beethoven, with pianoforte illustrations; January 30th, Mr. Philip Norman, F.S.A., "The Roman Wall of London"; March 6th, Mr. Warwick H. Draper, M.A., "King Alfred." March 20th, Mr. C. H. Rosher, "Morocco Unbound." With the exception of the first, the lectures were illustrated with limelight views. They were ably delivered and were well attended by highly appreciative audiences. The Libraries Committee desires to record its best thanks to the lecturers for their services, and also to the Borough Council for granting the use of the Town Hall free of charge. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. MARTIN, Chief Librarian Central Library, March, 1906. 190 CARNEGIE CENTRAL LIBRARY. THE OPENING CEREMONY. The formal opening of the new Library Building took place on the 24th Tuly, 1905, the ceremony being performed by His Grace the Duke of Argyll, K.T. The Mayor (Alderman Levy, J.P.) presided, and was supported by Alderman Acton Phillips (Chairman of the Libraries Committee), Councillor Hodgson (Vice-Chairman), the Members of the Libraries Committee and the Borough Councillors; Rev. J. Parry (Vicar of Hammersmith); Archdeacon Kaye (Lincoln); the Chief Rabbi (Dr. Adler); Mr. H. T. Hare (the Architect); the Town Clerk (Mr. H. Thompson), the Chief Librarian (Mr. S. Martin), and a representative company of residents in the Borough. The proceedings opened with prayer by the Vicar. Alderman Acton Phillips, the Chairman of the Committee, then made an introductory statement. It was gratifying to that large assembly, he said, to welcome His Grace the Duke of Argyll on his visit to open the new library. For the information of those unacquainted with the work carried out since the adoption of the Public Libraries Act in 1887, the Alderman gave an account of the libraries of the district since Lord Avebury, then Sir John Lubbock, opened the first public library in Ravenscourt Park. The Committee, he continued, had been considerably assisted in the work of beautifying the library by several gentlemen whose gifts are duly acknowledged in the short account of the building. In giving some statistics of the work of the libraries, the Alderman stated that 1,177,822 volumes had been issued from Ravenscourt Park, 954,760 from Shepherd's Bush since 1896, and since 1899 from College Park 15,991 volumes, making a grand total of 2,848,563 volumes. The number of visitors to the reading rooms averaged 2,000 per day, and the number of volumes available when the library was opened would be 34,500. The Reference Library at Ravenscourt Park would be removed, and with the additions made, 6,000 volumes would be at the public service. It would be seen that the libraries had been a great success; and being situated in the most thickly-populated district of the borough, it was anticipated the Carnegie Library would be the means of augmenting the educational work of the schools. The Mayor formally welcomed His Grace. He said on behalf of the Aldermen and Councillors of Hammersmith, and he was sure he might say on behalf of the inhabitants generally, he had to 191 ask His Grace's acceptance of a gold key as a memento of the occasion. He might add that the members of the Council who had been associated with the work of the Library from its commencement, had looked forward with a great deal of pride and pleasure to its completion. They felt pleased and delighted with it, and His Grace's presence there would add to their pleasure. (Applause.) The Duke of Argyll, in reply, thanked the Mayor for the present. They had been told, he continued, to "owe no man anything," but in regard to Mr. Carnegie that was certainly impossible, for almost every county in Great Britain owed a great deal to him. He was the greatest giver of all time. Though he went from Scotland and became a citizen of the United States, he had not forgotten the old land; he was just as keen as ever to do the old country good, and he believed he had condescended to buy an estate there. Famous men certainly had lived at Hammersmith, but he hoped those who were to respond to the call for portraits of celebrities would not forget the famous women. Many famous women had been associated with Hammersmith, and at one time Brandenberg House was a centre of re-union for the fashionable world. Lady Craven, who became the Margravine of Anspach, was also one who dispensed hospitality there, and had the habit of writing plays. Many other historical recollections had been given him. After referring to the connection with Hammersmith of Sir S. Morland, J. M. W. Turner, Sir C. Wheatstone (the electrician), Captain Marryat and other eminent persons, His Grace declared the building open. The Mayor announced that a letter had been received from Mr. Carnegie's Private Secretary, who wrote:—"Mr. Carnegie thanks you for your repeated invitations to attend the opening ceremony, but regrets that previous engagements make it impossible for him to accept." The Chief Rabbi (the Rev. Dr. Adler) said he esteemed it a great privilege to have been called upon to voice the gratitude of that assembly, and of all the inhabitants of Hammersmith, to Mr. Andrew Carnegie for his very munificent contribution towards the erection of that splendid library. It might be of interest to some to hear how it was Mr. Carnegie had devoted his life and his fortune more especially to the endowment of free libraries. It might be within their recollection that in 1890 an article appeared in one of the reviews by Mr. Carnegie on the gospel of wealth, and at his request he (the speaker) joined a symposium with Mr. Gladstone, the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, and others, on the subject of irresponsible wealth. Mr. Carnegie, in his article, said it was the great duty of the man of wealth to set an example of unostentatious living without display or extravagance, and to provide moderately 192 for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him, and by so doing to consider all his surplus revenue as a trust fund which he was bound to administer in the manner best calculated to produce the most beneficent results for the community at large. That was why Mr. Carnegie considered a free library one of the wisest gifts to be given, provided always it was maintained as a public institution. Mr. Carnegie had now given about £8,000,000 for the benefit of English speaking people, thus being the largest individual constructer of buildings in the world. He (the speaker) honoured the Hammersmith Borough Council for having so readily adopted the Free Libraries Act. The libraries had always been of immense value wherever they had been established, and indeed they were essential at the present day, for it would be disastrous to leave the elementary education of the children unsupplemented. The library undoubtedly did a great deal in this direction. It ought not to be regarded as merely for recreation; it was to foster a love for books, and to enable the young especially to gain information concerning the occupations they were to take up. He rejoiced to know a special room was being set apart for the boys, but he would like that, if possible, the Librarian might prepare a special course of reading for the young. (Hear, hear.) Their profound thanks, he concluded, were due to Mr. Carnegie. The Rev. R. J. Walker, in seconding, said he might claim on behalf of Hammersmith that it was a borough in feeling and not in name only. There were many places in London dignified by the name of borough, yet were without any local feeling. In Hammersmith far the opposite was the case. The speaker went on to allude to the great value to the public of the new Library, and contrasting literary and scientific training, said sufficient justification for the former was the pleasure it gave, and by reading both private and public life was influenced. Dean Colet, the founder of St. Paul's School—in memory of whom he had had the honour of presenting a small window to the Library—made a great point that literature, and not bloterature, should be read, and this ought to be the maxim of the reading public to-day. DESCRIPTION OF THE CARNEGIE LIBRARY. In July, 1902, Dr. Andrew Carnegie, most generously offered to give £1o,000 to erect a Central Library for Hammersmith provided the cost of the site was not a burden on the Penny Rate. The Borough Council, with the permission of the Local Government Board, kindly granted a site in Brook Green Road, having a frontage of about 150 feet. The building was erected from the plans of Mr. H. T. Hare, F.R.I.B.A. The foundation stone was laid on 5th May, 1904, by the then Mayor (Alderman C. Pascall). 193 The accommodation provided comprises the following rooms:— On the Ground Floor- Lending Library, with shelving for 22,000 volumes. News Room, 60 feet by 25 feet. Magazine Room, 44 feet by 25 feet. Boys' Room, 15 feet 6 inches by 25 feet. Also Staff Rooms, &c On the First Floor- Reference Library, 60 feet by 25 feet, with book-cases for 5,000 volumes. Stack Room, with shelving for 10,000 volumes. Committee Room. Residence for Sub-Librarian. In the basement is the heating chamber and filing room. The general arrangement of these rooms has been designed especially with a view to facility and economy of working, and efficient supervision. All parts of the building are abundantly lighted and ventilated. Externally the building is faced with best red bricks,with Portland stone dressings, and the roofs are covered with Precelly slates of varied sizes and colour. The main front possesses a somewhat unusual feature in two large statues of Shakespeare and Milton, and is further adorned with other low-relief sculptures representing art, science, literature and commerce. The whole of the floors throughout ara of fireproof construction. The joinery, fittings and furniture in all the public rooms is of wainscot oak, fumigated and slightly wax polished The entrance hall is paved with black and white marble slabs, and the walls are lined with polished Hopton wood stone, of which material the main staircase is also constructed. The upper landing, or corridor, has a groined and vaulted ceiling, and is paved with Hopton wood stone and marble. The Reference Library is a fine room, with a vaulted ceiling in plaster. The central portion is lighted from the top, and there is also a large window at each end. These windows, together with those on the main staircase, are filled with stained glass, mostly presented by members of the Committee. The staircase windows contain medallions of Spenser, Chaucer, Erasmus, and Bacon ; the west window of the Reference Library contains the Borough Arms and those of Sir Nicholas Crisp. The east window in the same room, presented by Rev. R. J. Walker contains a full-length portrait of Dean Colet, and is a very fine piece of work, which adds much to the interest and dignity of the room. The heating is by low-pressure hot water, with ventilating radiators fixed in various positions as required. Extraction of foul air is provided for by an electric fan in the roof, connected by flues with the various rooms. It has been the aim of the Committee to make the Library reflect, in some measure, the past history of the Borough, and with this object in view it has selected the names of twelve former inhabitants who had achieved distinction in the world of Art, Literature or Science. These, with the dates of birth and death, have been placed on the walls of the Reference Library. 194 The following are the names:— Literature. Henry Fielding, 1707-1754. Captain Frederick Marryat, R.N., 1792-1848, John Kaye, D.D., Bishop of Lincoln, 1785-1853. Charles Reade, M.A., D.C.L., 1814-1884. William Morris, 1834-1896. Art. Thomas Worlidge, 1700-1766. Giovanni B. Cipriani, R.A., 1727-1785. J. Mallord W. Turner, R.A., 1775-1851. Science. Sir Samuel Morland, Bart., 1625-1695. Sir Francis Ronalds, F.R.S., 1788-1873. John Radcliffe, M.D., 1650 1714. Sir Charles Wheatstone, F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D., 1802-1875. Some of the descendants of these distinguished persons have shown their appreciation of the Committee's action by presenting to the Library a portrait or other memento, and the Library Committee would gladly welcome any similar gifts. The Committee desires to record its sincere thanks to the generous donor, Dr. Andrew Carnegie, for his munificent gift, by means of which a Library has been erected that will be a source of pleasure and profit to present and future citizens of this large and important Borough. The Committee further desires to thank the following gentlemen who have generously contributed to make this handsome and commodious Library more complete from an artistic point of view:— Rev. R. J. WALKER, M.A., East window of Reference Library. Alderman C. PASCALL, Borough Arms in West window of Reference Library. GERY MILNER-GIBSON-CULLUM, Esq., The Crisp Arms in West window of Reference Library. Alderman T. CHAMBERLEN, J.P., Medallion of Chaucer. Alderman ACTON PHILLIPS, Medallion of Bacon. Councillor J. C.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, the Assessment Committee beg to submit their report for the year ended 6th April, 1906:— Appointment of Committee. 1. The Committee was appointed at a meeting of the Borough Council, held on 19th April, 1905. The first meeting was held on the 8th June, 1905, when Alderman Chamberlen, J.P., was elected Chairman, and Alderman Glasier Vice-Chairman. In consequence of the resignation of Alderman Glasier, the Council, on the 4th October, 1905, appointed Councillor Hooper, a member of the Committee, to fill the vacancy so created. Number of Meetings. 2. The number of meetings held was 38, and the attendances of the members was as under:— Alderman Apsey 35 Alderman Glasier *12 Councillor Atkinson 34 Councillor Hooper *4 Councillor Bendon 27 Councillor Marsh 28 Councillor Boarder 32 Councillor May 21 Alderman Chamberlen 36 Alderman Pascall 27 Alderman Cramp 26 Councillor Tomes 11 Councillor Watkins 38 * Did not serve the full period. Quinquennial Valuation List, 1905. 3. This year being the quinquennial period for revising the Valuation List for the whole of the Borough, the Committee have had to devote a very considerable amount of time to the work. The new Valuation List was deposited by the Borough Council, acting as the Overseers, on the 17th June, 1905, and transmitted to the Committee on the 3rd July, 1905. The List contained upwards of 22,000 assessments, and owing to the large number of increases made therein, the objections received by the Committee were more numerous than usual. The total number of assessments objected to was 3,159, and the number reduced by the Committee on objection or otherwise was 1,397. The number of assessments increased by the 212 Committee was 131, of which, after objection on the re-deposit of the List, 79 were maintained. The List was finally approved by the Committee on the 16th November, 1905, and the result of the revision shewed a nett decrease on the Overseers' valuation of £18,831, Rateable Value. The totals of the List as approved were as follow:— Gross Value £990,316 Rateable Value £797,658 shewing an increase on the quinquennial valuation of 1900 of: Gross Value £176,839 Rateable Value £131,365 and an increase on the valuation in force in 1905 of: Gross Value £56,715190 Rateable Value £42,08100 The following analysis of the description of the various properties in the List, shews the total Rateable Value of each description of property, and the result of the revision:— T otat. Rateable Value. Result of Revision. Increase. Decrease. (i) Railways, Tramways, Electric Light Undertakings, Water Works, Gas Works, Cemeteries, Canals and Telephones £ 119,887 £ 9.227 £ - (2) Factories, Warehouses, Laundries and Workshops 35.708 3,110 (3) Licensed Premises 34,881 2,178 — (4) Theatres and Places of Public Entertainment 6,886 2,416 (5) Public Schools and Educational and Charitable Institutions 27.503 810 (6) Public Buildings, &c. 2,882 — 357 (7) Government Property 12,679 45 — (8) Agricultural Land 448 — 330 (9) Houses, Shops and other Properties 556.784 29,814 — £797.658 £45.184 £3.103 Net Increase £42,081 213 Appeals to Special Sessions. 4. Three notices of appeal to Special Sessions against the Valuation List were received by the Committee, viz.:- (a) From Mr. A. Churchman, in respect of 16 King Street. (b) From Mr. J. B. Mulholland, in respect of " The King's Theatre." (c) From Mr. H. H. Bartlett, in respect of 1 to 15 Addison Court Gardens. Mr. Churchman's appeal came before the Kensington Special Sessions on the 5th December, 1905, and was dismissed on the ground that the notice did not set out the correction desired to be made as required by Section 33 of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Mr. Mulholland's appeal was, with consent, withdrawn, the appellant having notified his intention to appeal to the Quarter Sessions. In Mr. Bartlett's appeal, terms were agreed between the parties, and were confirmed by the Court, whereby a small additional allowance was made to the appellant in respect of landlord's outgoings. Appeals to Quarter Sessions. 5. Eight notices of appeal to Quarter Sessions against the Valuation List were received by the Committee as follow:— (a) From Mr. J. B. Mulholland, in respect of " The King's Theatre ": Before the case was set down for hearing terms were agreed between the parties whereby the assessment was reduced from Gross Value £950, and Rateable Value £792, to Gross Value £840, and Rateable Value £700, each party paying their own costs, and the arrangement has since been confirmed by the Court. (b) From Mr. G. Riley in respect of "The Swan" Laundry, Blythe Road : Before the case was set down for hearing, terms were agreed between the parties, whereby the assessment was reduced from Gross Value £506, and Rateable Value £380, to Gross Value £480, and Rateable Value £320, each party paying their own costs, and the arrangement has since been confirmed by the Court. (c) From Mr. T. D. Chapman in respect of " The sheaf," 163 Goldhawk Road: 214 This appeal came into Court for hearing on the 26th February, 1906, the appellant being represented by Mr. Ryde, of Counsel, and the Committee by Mr. Bodkin, of Counsel. Before the case was opened, the Chairman, Mr. Loveland-Loveland, K.C., suggested that an endeavour should be made to settle the appeal, and the parties thereupon consulted together, and ultimately agreed upon terms, whereby the assessment was reduced from Gross Value ^,600, and Rateable Value £500, to Gross Value ^.'495 and Rateable Value ^413, each party paying their own costs, and this arrangement was confirmed by the Court. (d) From the London County Council in respect of the Council Schools at Addison Gardens, Cobbold Road, Saunders Road and Kenmont Gardens : These appeals were lodged by the London County Council with a view to the adoption throughout London of certain general principles for the assessing of the Council Schools ; but after the Court of Quarter Sessions had given decisions adverse to the contentions of the London County Council in the appeals against the assessments of certain Council Schools in other boroughs, which had been selected as test cases, the appeals were, by consent, withdrawn, each party agreeing to pay their own costs. (e) From the Imperial Tobacco Company, in respect of Factory, 81 Fulham Palace Road: This appeal has not yet been heard. Provisional Lists. 6. Seven Provisional Lists have been deposited with, and considered by the Committee during the year. The total number of assessments contained in these Lists is 1,152, of which 519 represent new properties. There were 101 objections lodged against the Lists, and 59 thereof were allowed, and the remainder disallowed. The totals of the Valuation List above given are further increased by these Lists as follows :— Gross Value ... ... £16,253 Rateable Value ... ... £13,088 Expenses. 7. The expenditure of the Committee during the past year, excluding the costs of the Appeals to Sessions, was as follows:— 215  £ s. d. Temporary Clerical Assistance 25 15 0 Printing, &c. 88 9 3 Expenses of Meetings 41 17 11 £156 2 2 The costs in the Appeals have not yet been ascertained. Remuneration of Clerk and his Staff. 8. Having regard to the extraordinary services which have been rendered by the Town Clerk, acting as Clerk to the Committee, and the Rating Clerical Staff in connection with the revision of the Valuation List, the Committee considers that such services should be specially recognised. The Committee has therefore fixed the remuneration of the Clerk to the Committee at £100, of which sum £50 will be divided between the clerical staff. It will be necessary for the sanction of the Local Government Board to be obtained to the amount of the proposed remuneration, and the Committee recommends that application be made for such sanction. Vote of Thanks to Chairman. 9. The Committee has accorded a hearty vote of thanks to the Chairman (Alderman Chamberlen) for his able and impartial conduct in the chair, and has expressed its grateful recognition of his indefatigable attention to the duties of his position, and of the great assistance which his long experience has enabled him to render to the Committee in carrying out their difficult and arduous duties.

C. 17 Neighbour, W. 13 Davies, Lt.-Col. T. W. 20 Pascall, C. 3 POWERS AND DUTIES OF COMMITTEE. By Section 1 (2) of the Act, the Distress Committee has to make itself acquainted with the conditions of labour within its area, and when so required by the Central Body, to receive, inquire into, and discriminate between any applications made to them by persons unemployed. Regulations for carrying the Act into effect were made and issued by the Local Government Board on the 10th October, 1905, and set out fully the powers and duties of the Committee and the conditions under which applications under the Act might properly be entertained. On 23rd November, 1905, the Distress Committee received from the Central Body instructions to take immediate steps to receive, inquire into, and discriminate between any applications made to them from persons unemployed, and fixed twelve months' residence in London immediately before application as the residential qualification under section 2 of the Act. 222 Great care and discrimination had to be exercised by the Committee in administering the Act. In this the Committee obtained the co-operation of the Borough Council and the Board of Guardians. The former transferred the control of the labour bureau to the Committee, and paid the cost of providing increased accommodation thereat, and of connecting it with the Post Office telephone exchange system. The Guardians authorised their officers to furnish the Committee with any information they might possess which would assist the Committee in investigating applications from persons out of employment. APPLICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT. In order that publicity might be given to the Committee's operations, placards were published throughout the Borough, informing persons out of employment, and possessing the necessary residential qualification, that they might register their names at the labour bureau. The total number of applications received in response to this notice was 1,361, the occupations of the applicants being as follow:— (a) Mechanics, &c. :— Bricklayers 57 Fitters' Mates 23 Blacksmiths 4 French Polishers 1 Carpenters and Joiners 52 Gardeners 8 Carmen 93 Messengers and Porters 67 Horsekeepers 32 Painters 260 Clerks 31 Stone Masons 14 Engine Drivers 14 Tailors and Improvers 5 Electricians 5 694 Fitters 28 (b) Labourers:— Building Trade 123 Plumbers 8 Scaffolders 13 Painters 27 Masons 8 General 268 Plasterers 10 649 Excavators 182 Laundrymen 10 (c) Females:— Teacher of Music 1 Charwomen 5 Trained Nurse 1 General Servant 1 Governess 1 18 Dressmaking 1 Plain Cooks 8 Of these, 1,020 men and 5 women were married, and 323 men and 13 women were single. 223 The ages of the applicants were as follow:— Men Women Total From 16 to 25 225 1 226 ,, 26 to 35 398 8 406 ,, 36 to 45 328 3 331 ,, 46 to 55 251 3 254 „ 56 to 65 116 3 119 „ 66 to 75 25 — 25 Totals 1,343 18 1,361 By order of the Central Body the Register of Applications was closed on the 31st March, 1906. INVESTIGATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF APPLICATIONS. In 574 of the above cases the Committee was unable for various reasons to make any investigation, the chief being through false addresses having been given and disinclination on the part of applicants to give the particulars required for record purposes. All the other cases (787) were carefully investigated by the Investigation Officer by inquiry at the homes of the applicants and by communicating with the applicants' references. The record papers, which were filled up by the same officer at the time of his investigation, were submitted to and considered by the Sub-Committee in detail, and classified as follows:— Class 1. (Applicants deserving of preferential treatment) 249 Class 2. (Applicants whose cases might properly be entertained but whose circumstances did not entitle them to be placed in the first class) 442 Class 3. (Applicants whom the Committee could not recommend for employment) 96 Included in the above were 93 applicants who were disqualified through having received poor relief, but in 25 of the cases the circumstances were such as entitled them to special consideration, and accordingly, permission to entertain them was applied for and obtained from the Central Body. 224 No applicant was recommended for work until after he had been seen personally by the Sub-Committee, which selected the men according to their fitness for the work which it was able to offer.
