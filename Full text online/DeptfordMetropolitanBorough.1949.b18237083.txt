Sherwood Public Health Department, Deptford Town Hall, S.E.14. June, 1950. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during 1949. I took over the duties of Medical Officer of Health on 1st July, 1949. the work carried out by the Public Health Department during the first half of the year under review being under the direction of my predecessor, Dr. F. Leonard Keith. Dr. Keith was appointed as Medical Officer of Health in 1929. The improvement in the standard of health and the lowering of the death rates particularly for infectious diseases and for young children speak eloquently for his work in Deptford. Dr. Keith will also be remembered for his exceptional knowledge of housing and housing law and those who worked with him during the war still speak of his unfailing devotion to duty and his ever ready help during those difficult and dangerous years. I would personally like to record my thanks to him for the kindness and assistance which he showed to me when I took over his post and to express the hope that the years of his retirement will be both numerous and satisfying. The retirement also occurred of Mr. C. A. Chapman, Assistant Administrative Officer after 50 years of local government service, 38 years of which were spent in the service of this Borough. During this time Mr. Chapman had deservedly won the high regard of his colleagues and of the Council and his outstanding administrative ability and wide knowledge of the Borough were of very great assistance to the Department. I would like to record my thanks to the Town Clerk and all the members of the staff for their ready help and co-operation and to my own staff for their loyal assistance. My thanks are also due to the Council and in particular to the Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and encouragement. I remain, Your obedient Servant, R. Duncan Dewar, Medical Officer of Health 2 STAFF Medical Officer of Health R. Duncan Dewar, b.sc., m.b., ch.b., d.p.h. (1.7.49-31.12.49) F. L. Keith, m.d., ch.b., d.p.h., l.d.s.

The estimated civil population for mid-1949 shows an increase of 700 over the estimate for 1949. It will be noted that although the birth rates and death rates are slightly better for Deptford than for London as a whole, the birth rate shows a steady decline from the peak of 25.4 in 1947 and that there is an increase in the death rate. The infantile mortality rate is increased but the figure must be treated with reserve where a single death makes an appreciable difference to the rate. In spite of the increase, the infantile mortality rate of 29 compares favourably with the rate of 56 which was the average for the 10 years before the war. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix, Table I.

Diphtheria It is satisfying to record that there were only 3 cases of diphtheria notified during the year (about 1 per cent of the number in pre-war years) and there were no deaths. Whooping Cough Whooping cough notifications numbered 67, a decrease on previous years. There was unfortunately one death and it is not possible to estimate the amount of ill-health in later years resulting from this disease, which must still be regarded as one of the major diseases of infancy. Poliomyelitis Five cases of poliomyelitis were notified and in 2 cases the patient died. The epidemic which affected the county was less serious than that of 1947 when 20 cases were notified in Deptford. Weils Disease A case of Weils disease occurred in which the patient died. The man was employed as a sewer worker and examinations showed, by blood agglutination tests, that 3 out of 18 other sewer workers in Deptford had at some time suffered from this disease. Food Poisoning During the year 29 cases of food poisoning were notified. Two outbreaks were investigated, both occurring in factory canteens, and in both cases investigations started as a result of communication from the management. In one outbreak 99 persons were affected and in the other 32 persons were affected. In all cases the persons were ill for only a few hours, they did not consult their own doctors and were not notified as suffering from food poisoning. Investigation did not establish the organisms responsible and although in both outbreaks it appeared likely that the food responsible was meat cooked on the day prior to consumption no firm conclusions could be reached from bacteriological investigation. Coagulase positive stephylococci were obtained from swabs from three out of the kitchen staff's and medical treatment was obtained in these cases. Improvements in the hygiene of food preparation was advised and there have been no subsequent outbreaks. Of the notified individual cases 4 were found to be due to Salmonella typhi-murium but the origin of the organisms could not be ascertained with certainty. In a number of the cases notification was received so late that investigation was abortive and it would appear that there are still larger numbers who, because the symptoms are so mild, do not consult their doctors and are consequently not notified. 7 1949 Infectious Diseases.

TUBERCULOSIS The responsibility for treatment and prevention of tuberculosis is now divided. The treatment is the responsibility of the Regional Hospital Board, the County Council as Local Health Authority is responsible for care and after care, and the Local Authority has responsibilities for the prevention of the spread of disease and for the maintenance of the Tuberculosis Register. The number of notifications of tuberculosis was much higher than in the previous year and this may be due to earlier diagnosis and the diagnosis of cases previously missed by reason of the availability of the general practitioner service and the use of mass miniature radiography. The number of deaths from tuberculosis as notified by the Registrar General was 44, made up as follows:— Respiratory tuberculosis Males 35; Females 5 Tuberculosis, other forms Males 2; Females 2 The death rate from all forms of tuberculosis is 0.58 per 1,000 of the population. 8 Tuberculosis Register Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F Total M F Total Cases notified for the first time 109 80 189 8 11 19 New cases in Borough coming to knowledge otherwise than by notification 17 13 30 2 1 3 Cases on Tuberculosis Register at 31.12.49 455 331 786 64 87 151 The following is a Report from the Chest Physician, Dr. J. P. V. Rigby:— Deptford Tuberculosis Statistics for 1949 During 1949 the number of cases which came on to the Deptford Chest Clinic Register were 215 new cases, 43 inward transfers and 25 cases "lost-sight-of-returned," making a total of 283 cases. Of this total, 16 new cases, 7 inward transfers and 6 "lost-sight-of-returned" were non-respiratory cases. Of the 215 cases diagnosed as tuberculous for the first time, 199 were respiratory, and of these 67 were sputum positive and therefore infectious shortly after the first examination. Forty-six cases on the Chest Clinic Register died during 1949, of which 3 were non-respiratory. One of the respiratory cases is understood to have died primarily for reasons other than those of tuberculosis. Eighty-three tuberculous families were transferred out of the Borough, presumably to be re-housed elsewhere, but in spite of this, there was an increase of 113 net in the Chest Clinic Register, after allowing for deaths and transfers elsewhere. This will give some idea of the local problem of tuberculosis in Deptford. It is interesting to note that 43 tuberculous families were re-housed in Deptford during 1949, either by the local authority or by their own initiative. It appears that 13 of these families were re-housed in Deptford by the local authority, and it would seem regrettable that cases of pulmonary tuberculosis should be re-housed by the local authority into such a congested area. Following is a table showing the number of new cases diagnosed over the last five years, and also the number of deaths from tuberculosis. It will be seen that there has been a considerable increase in the number of new cases diagnosed in 1949 compared with the previous four years, though there is little change in the number of deaths over the same period. New Cases Deaths Resp. Non-Resp. Total Resp. Non-Resp.

There are comparatively few houses in the Borough which did not suffer any war damage and in general owners have been anxious to get war damage repairs completed and they have done routine maintenance at the same time. Although the general permission to do work to the value of £100 per dwelling without a licence has allowed minor works to be completed more quickly, the major works of repair and maintenance are still subject to building licence control. In these circumstances some owners have welcomed the serving of statutory notices because of the assistance they afford in obtaining licences, and in obtaining settlement of war damage claims, and some owners have encouraged their tenants to make complaints to the Public Health Department with a view to the serving of a notice. The cost of maintenance is however extremely high and whilst owners are willing, or even anxious, to carry out full repairs to property where a substantial portion of the cost is covered by a war damage claim it is likely that in the future they will be less willing to meet the costs of ordinary maintenance. It may be mentioned that the cost of maintaining those houses which were built by the Council in 1920-22 has given rise to some concern. Some private owners of older property have already indicated that with present costs and with controlled rents they find that it would be uneconomic to expend any money on properties which may only have a moderate additional "life." Other information concerning housing will be found in Section "E." A summary of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors with comparative figures for the post war years is given below:— 1946 1947 1948 1949 Total primary inspections 8,609 7,234 9,179 7,764 Total re-inspections 23,840 23,340 27,988 27,031 Total intimation notices served 1,758 3,404 2,934 2,675 Total statutory notices served 702 1,203 1,181 1,043 Total premises on which works were completed 1,695 3,013 2,735 2,574 Total improvements effected during the year 3,937 7,303 9,384 9,120 11 For four months out of the year the Department was without the services of one of the Sanitary Inspectors. The abnormally dry summer assisted in keeping down the number of complaints which are normally received on account of defective roofs, gutters etc., although when the drought came to an end in October nearly 200 complaints regarding defective roofs were received and the necessary notices were served within 2 days. Details of inspections and of sanitary improvements effected will be found in the Appendix, Tables II and III. Smoke Abatement The problem of nuisance from the emission of smoke, grit etc., is one which is constantly before the staff. In one case the industrial process is one which is specifically excluded from the bye-laws. Visits and consultation with the management of the factory have produced some improvement but a nuisance does still occasionally exist from time to time. Offensive Trades There are two premises in the Borough where offensive trades are carried on. At one factory structural alterations were carried out under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector and considerable improvement resulted. No notices were necessary in this connection. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and one Operator were employed throughout the year. The number of complaints received was 455. The number of investigations made was 1,248 and the number of operations carried out was 549, of which 29 were at business premises. A high proportion of the business premises in the borough have their own contracts with private firms for the extermination of rats and mice and this accounts for the small number of business premises visited. In addition, the sewers throughout the borough are baited and treated every six months. This treatment is carried out in co-operation with adjoining boroughs so as to obtain the maximum effect. Disinfection and Cleansing The use of the disinfector at the South-Eastern Fever Hospital (now re-named the New Cross General Hospital) was continued as a temporary measure throughout the year, the Bathing Station also occupying part of the hospital premises. Neither of these are entirely satisfactory. It is also anticipated that the Regional Hospital Board will require the premises to be vacated in the near future but difficulties have previously arisen in the selection of a site for new premises. The bathing station and disinfector destroyed by enemy action were situated in Watson Street and this site 12 has now been scheduled as an open space. It is hoped that an alternative site which has been suggested will be approved and that the construction of a new station will not be unduly delayed. The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 330 Premises disinfected (requests) 47 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 526 Premises disinfected (removals) 18 Total number of articles disinfected 21, 504 Books disinfected 157 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 139 Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 1,214 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies 45 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 261 Scabies baths for adults 35 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 185 new premises comprising 23 houses and 162 flats. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits etc., are carried out by the District Sanitary Inspectors. Inspections Number on Register Number of Inspections Notices Written Occupiers Prosecuted (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2,3,4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 42 30 (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 281 158 8 13 Defects Found Sanitary Conveniences: Found Remedied To H.M.

Whitening manufacturers. Laundries, cleaners. Offensive trades. Marine stores. Miscellaneous. Paint and varnish works. The number of inspections made to home workers premises was 79. The types of work carried on by outworkers in this Borough were as follows:— Wearing apparel, umbrellas, artificial flowers, paper bags, string bags and lampshades. Section "D" FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 16 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of food and food premises. Food samples are normally sent for analysis to the Public Analyst but following the provision of laboratory facilities at the Park Hospital by the Public Health Laboratory Service towards the end of the year samples of milk and ice cream are sent to the latter laboratory for bacteriological and allied examination. Further details of the latter laboratory will be found in Section " G." Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix, Table V, and the Report of the Public Analyst is included at the end of this Section. Royal Victoria Yard Following the cessation of hostilities and the reduction of naval establishments, particularly in the Far East very large quantities of food, mainly dried, preserved or tinned, were returned to the Royal Victoria Yard from ships and other establishments of the Royal Navy. Considerable quantities of this food have been examined at the request of the Admiralty, much of it being considered unfit for further prolonged storage and examination being necessary to assess its fitness for release to the public. Ice Cream Some improvement was made throughout the year in the conditions under which ice cream is made and handled in the Borough. Traders have in general been co-operative in improving standards, and the bacteriological purity has improved although there is still room for further progress. Makers who agreed to a minimum fat content of 2½ per cent in the ice cream were given an extra allocation of certain raw materials and it has been found that the actual content of fat in most samples of ice cream is in the region of 10 per cent. During the year 35 samples were sent for bacteriological examination and 10 samples for chemical analysis. It is hoped to increase the number of samples in subsequent years. Labelling of Food Order, 1946 All pre-packed samples of food submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were considered also under the Labelling of Food Order, 1946. In 53 instances, separate Certificates of Analysis were issued for this reason. Several slight infringements were dealt with by correspondence. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 All pre-packed drugs submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were also considered under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. In 5 instances, separate reports were received. Food Standards Foity six samples were specially examined under the various Food Standard Orders. In one or two instances correspondence with the manufacturers produced improved products. 17 Public Health (Preservatives, etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable, Food and Drugs Act samples were also examined in the light of the Public Health (Preservatives etc., in Food) Regulations. Thirty-seven reports of this type were received. Mineral Oil in Food Order, 1949 Seven samples were examined under this new Order with negative results. Flourine in Food Order, 1947 The 10 samples submitted were found to comply with this Order. Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations The 2 samples submitted were found to comply with these Regulations. Artificial Cream Act, 1929 Although synthetic cream is made at one factory in the Borough, it does not come within the definition of "Artificial Cream." The nature of this product is such that numerous visits are made to ensure its hygienic production. Pharmacy and Poison Act, 1933 Forty-six visits were made and 2 samples were taken. No action was found necessary. School Milks Twenty-one samples of milk from deliveries to schools in the Borough were submitted for chemical examination and 24 for bacteriological examination. Two samples of milk from day nurseries were also submitted for bacteriological examination. Milk (Special Designations) Act The various milk premises in the Borough were all visited in connection with the re-registration under the above Act. Licences were granted for the sale of:— Tuberculin Tested milk, Pasteurised and Sterilized milk. Thirty-two samples of Designated Milk were submitted in order to detect any irregularities under the Act. On three occasions faults were found in Pasteurised milk and the dairies concerned were notified. Follow-up samples showed the faults to have been rectified. 18 H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., Public Analyst, Analytical Laboratory, 1 Southwark Street, S.E.I. 1st February, 1950. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1949. During the year 529 samples were submitted for analysis under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by your Sampling Officers. These samples were also examined wherever applicable under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, the Food Standards Orders, 1944-49, and the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946-49. Of the total number, 104 were taken formally, in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Food and Drugs Act, the remaining 425 being undivided, or informal samples. Full particulars of samples submitted and results of analyses under the Food and Drugs Act have been furnished in the Quarterly Reports; adulteration or irregularities were found in 16 instances, and the following table summarises the proportions of milk samples and other samples of food and drugs recorded as unsatisfactory during the year, with the corresponding figures for the three previous years. Number Submitted Number " Adulterated " Percentage "Adulterated" 1946 Milk samples 180 4 2.2 Other samples 52 11 7.2 Total 332 15 4.5 1947 Milk samples 137 8 5.8 Other samples 260 16 6.2 Total 397 24 6.0 1948 Milk samples 164 4 2.4 Other samples 353 28 7.9 Total 517 32 6.2 1949 Milk samples 128 0 0 Other samples 401 16 4.0 Total 529 16 3.0 19 Of the 128 samples of milk analysed, 101 were submitted as Sunday samples, only 27 having been taken on other days. None of the milk samples analysed fell below the minimum legal standard in Fat or Solids-not-fat. The absence of any manifest instance of milk adulteration during the year is very satisfactory; but it will be regretted that the average quality of the milk shows little improvement over the low averages recorded in these Reports in the past few years. The fall in milk solids during the months February, March and April, was, however, less marked than in the previous years. Deptford Southern England Feb.-April 1949 Whole Year 1949 Year 1948 Year 1947 Year 1946 Pre-War Average Fat 3.39 3.47 3.45 3.51 3.56 3.75 Solids-not-fat 8.62 8.74 8.72 8.68 8.73 888 Total solids 12.01 12.21 12.17 12.19 12.29 12.64 The testing of milk samples in this laboratory under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilized Milk) Regulations ceased at the end of the year. Among the samples other than milk reported as being unsatisfactory may be mentioned the following:— Two samples of Curry Powder (from the same source) adulterated with foreign flour; the flour was identified after a lengthy microscopical study of cultivated grains as being derived from the Cicer Arietinum, a plant grown in India and also known as Chick-pea and Bengal Gram. Curry powder should consist of ground spices, and a Food Standards Order has now been made which prescribes a standard of purity and comes into force on 1st April, 1950. This should simplify the legal position, which, in respect of adulteration committed in a foreign country, has proved very unsatisfactory. Samples of Greengage Jam from one manufacturer have been found slightly below the minimum standard of the Preserves Order (i.e. 38 per cent fruit). The position here is also rather unsatisfactory, since although one feels that action should be taken to maintain the present minimum quality of jam, which to judge from frequent complaints is thought by many people to be too low, any projected prosecution would have to be based upon and confined to one particular sample, and there are several ways open to defence to account for a small deficiency in the apparent fruit content of a single jar of jam. Samples of Tincture of Iodine, Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine and Sulphur Ointment failed to comply with the standard of the British Pharmacopoeia, and a sample of Effervescent Lemonade Powder was found to have deteriorated through exposure to moisture to such a degree 20 that it was no longer capable of effervescing. One sample of Tomato Ketchup contained an excessive amount of preservative, and two samples of Salad Cream, for which a legal standard is now in force, were found to be deficient in oil; several prosecutions have been successfully undertaken by other authorities in similar cases during 1949, and the matter has been effectively dealt with by drawing the manufacturer's attention to the deficiency. Consideration has also been given to the question of the proper composition of cakes and pastries, in which increasing use is being made of artificial fat extenders, emulsifying agents and the like, to replace egg, butter and other valuable foodstuffs, with consequent loss of nutritional value. In one sample of Meringue it was found that the whole of the white of egg, formerly considered the most essential constituent, had been replaced by a synthetic gum made from cellulose; the meringue was reported against as being not of the nature, substance and quality demanded by the purchaser. Since the whole question seems to be of fundamental importance to the people's nutrition, the relevant reports have, it is understood, been referred to the Ministry of Food for their information and comments. Attention was drawn in my Report for 1948 to the finding of mineral oils in samples of cakes etc., and their use in food was condemned on several grounds. Since then the Mineral Oil in Food Order, 1949, has been passed, prohibiting their use in the composition or preparation of food (except in such negligible proportions as might arise through contact with greasy utensils), and it is satisfactory to be able to record that although all samples of food in which they might occur were specially tested no instance of the presence of mineral oil was detected during 1949. During August a large consignment of pears from Italy was found, on being sampled at Southwark when unloaded at the Elephant and Castle, to be contaminated by arsenic. The arsenic was derived from the copper arsenite in an insecticidal spray, and could be seen on the skins in the form of powdery, greenish white residues, which owing to lack of rain during the summer months had not been washed off, as usually happens, before the pears were picked. The fruit, which was otherwise in good condition, was cleaned by the consignees by wiping with wet and dry rags. Further tests, which were carried out before the lot intended for sale in Deptford was released, showed the arsenic on the pears to have been reduced to less than 1 part per million, a safe proportion. In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, the results of which have been included in the Quarterly Reports, and summarised above, 132 samples were examined under other Acts, Orders and Regulations; particulars of these are furnished below:— 21 Relevant Act or Order Article Number of Samples Number Failing to Comply Nature of Irregularity Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949 Milk:— Failed to comply with the Methylene Blue Test.

Amphlett Williams Section "E" HOUSING 24 HOUSING The provision of additional dwellings has been one of the most important matters dealt with by the Council as indeed has been the case with all councils throughout the country. During 1949 difficulties were no less than in previous years although they were slightly different. Two hopes which were entertained at the end of the war have not been fulfilled. One was that mass production methods would hasten and cheapen the erection of houses, but these methods, which have been so successful in other industries, have not been satisfactorily applied to the building industry in spite of some improvements in building technique. The other hope was that pattern of costs would follow that of the years following the first World War when costs inevitably rose but reached a maximum about 3½ years after the end of the war, following which there was a steady decline. At the end of 1949, more than 4| years after the end of the war in Europe there was every indication that the cost of building houses was still rising sharply. The increased cost of dwelling requires increased rents and in spite of the government subsidy and the subsidy required to be met by the local authority the rent of a new dwelling is tending to be more than an ordinary working man can afford. The problem cannot be met merely by reducing the standards for design, materials and amenities because quite apart from the desirability of improving the general standards of housing, it is necessary to ensure that, for the normal loan period of 60 years, the buildings shall remain structurally sound and that they shall be sufficiently attractive to be fully occupied, although the housing position in say 20 or 40 years time may be very different from that of to-day. Deptford has also some particular difficulties which do not apply to the county as a whole. The area was fully built up before the war and it was desirable to increase the area of open spaces rather than to encroach on them for housing. It is likely that further development by the Council will have to be confined to the erection of flats rather than houses, which again adds to the cost of dwellings. Also the number of vacant sites suitable for development is very small and future building will necessitate the demolition of existing bad or sub-standard houses and the rehousing of their present occupants. This implies that, without assistance, the housing of applicants who are at present on the waiting list will be virtually impossible. Difficulties will also be encountered in the ultimate disposal of requisitioned houses which in this Borough involves over 1,400 premises and more than 2,000 units of tenancy. New dwellings completed and occupied during the year were as follows:— By the Borough Council 10 houses and 45 flats By the London County Council 105 flats By private owners 13 houses and 12 flats 25 At the end of the year 138 flats were in an advanced state of construction by the Borough Council on the undermentioned sites:— Shardeloes Road 31 flats Rokeby Road 17 flats Erlanger Road (East) 30 flats Idonia Street 60 flats (The 90 flats at Erlanger Road and Idonia Street were completed and occupied during the first quarter of 1950.) On other sites earmarked for housing by the Borough Council tenders had been submitted to the London County Council for approval in respect of Breakspears Road, Erlanger Road (West), and New Cross Road. In the maintenance of existing houses the following is a summary of the work done during 1949:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 3,567 Number of Statutory Notices served 1,043 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 2,574 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses represented to the Council 19 Number of Demolition Orders made by the Council following representation 3 Number of houses repaired by owners 1 Number of houses, the subject of Closing Orders 24 Number of Closing Orders determined 1 Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of year 170 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during year 150 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation with London County Council during year 42 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation other than with the London County Council 38 Underground Rooms Number occupied, but unfit 3 Number closed 3 26 There is a very large number of underground rooms throughout the Borough. Many of these rooms which are occupied as dwellings do not conform in every respect with the statutory requirements but closure is impracticable in present circumstances and owners have in general been very co-operative in maintaining them in reasonably fit condition. Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Certificates of Disrepair were granted in 16 cases during the year. Section "F" MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE 28 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE The personal health services became the responsibility of the London County Council on 5th July, 1948, and the operation of the services in London will be the subject of a report by the Medical Officer of Health for the County Council. The Borough of Deptford is included in Division 6, together with the Boroughs of Greenwich and Woolwich but in order to give some indication of the services provided in the area of the Borough as distinct from the Division, the Divisional Medical Officer has kindly supplied the figures which are included in this Section. It is not possible to compare the services with those provided either before the war or immediately after it. In some sections, notably that of diphtheria immunisation, the service was stimulated during the war by a national campaign and has increased accordingly; in the provision of home helps the demand increased rapidly and tremendously when the National Health Service Act came into force. Day nurseries were essentially a war-time provision whose usefulness has ensured their continuation, The pre-war Maternity Home in Wickham Road and the Babies Hospital in Breakspears Road which were provided by the Borough Council were closed during the war and were not re-opened. The efficiency of the present services may be judged by the vital statistics and other information included in this Report. The reduction in the loss of infant life, in the number of cases of diphtheria notified and the absence of any deaths from this disease are a good indication of the satisfactory state of the personal health services in preventing disease. The higher standards of health which are accepted and even demanded by the public show that the personal health services have played their part in the promotion of health. The administration of the services in Deptford is in the hands of the Divisional Medical Officer, Dr. F. R. Waldron, and he is assisted in the day-to-day work by the Medical Officers of Health of the three boroughs. It is gratifying to be able to record that co-operation between these officers and between the County Council and Borough Council staffs have been probably more friendly and complete than in any other part of London and special tribute should be paid to Dr. Waldron for this result. The following is a summary of the work done during the year:— The undermentioned information has been extracted from data which was very kindly supplied by Dr. Waldron. Health Visiting Visits paid to:—Premature infants 117 Infants under 1 year 5,291 Children 1-5 8,112 Expectant mothers 939 Stillbirths 38 Infectious diseases 840 Miscellaneous 4,434 Total visits paid 19,771 29 Infant Welfare Centres Clinic Sessions Attendances 0-1 1-2 2-5 First Total First Total First Total Amersham Rd 280 739 11,635 34 2,445 — — St. Georges 52 114 1,968 1 535 — — Hales Street 52 144 1,857 26 266 — — GosterwoodSt 48 154 2,063 — 419 — 2 Total 432 1,151 17,523 61 3,665 — 2 Toddlers' Clinic Clinic Sessions Total Attendances Found to Require Treatment Amersham Road 227 2,662 504 Ante-Natal Clinics Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Medical Midwife Medical Midwife Medical Midwife Amersham Road 202 184 740 — 2,612 1,445 St. Georges Hall 52 36 110 — 498 291 Post-Natal Clinic Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Amersham Road 24 194 224 Gynaecological Clinic Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Amersham Road 49 144 422 30 Sewing Class Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Amersham Road 15 29 192 Ante- and Post-Natal Exercise Class (26.11.49-31.12.49) Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Amersham Road 8 7 45 Dental Clinic Sessions Expectant or Nursing Mothers Children Under 5 Years First Treatment Total Attendances First Treatment Total Attendances Amersham Road 240 316 1,189 504 1,236 Artificial Sunlight Treatment Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Amersham Road 146 261 3,806 Immunisation CASES COMPLETED At Sessions At Day Nurseries By General Practitioners Total Smallpox 425 — 23 448 Diphtheria 1,284 18 20 1,322 Whooping Cough 1,105 18 8 1,131 Whooping and Diphtheria combined — — 11 11 31 Chiropody Sessions First Attendances Total Attendances Harton Street Clinic 713 1,169 15,536 Domestic Help Service The number of applications for home helps increased rapidly after 5th July, 1948, and the number of applicants remained high throughout 1949. The number of cases in which a home help was supplied was about 410 of which 113 were maternity cases and the remainder were old people and persons suffering from illness etc. The average number of home helps employed was approximately 70 representing an equivalent number of 33 full-time workers. Day Nurseries There are two day nurseries within the Borough. The nursery at Evelyn Street is a prefabricated building and has 60 places, the one at the New Cross General Hospital, Avonley Road, is in a portion of the hospital buildings and has 72 places. In both nurseries children are accepted from a few weeks old up to the age of 5 years. Section "G" MISCELLANEOUS 34 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses The only common lodging house in the Borough is Carrington House, Brookmill Road, which is maintained by the London County Council. Routine calls are made by the District Sanitary Inspector and special night visits are paid at intervals. Permission was given for a room on the ground floor to be used as a " sick-bay " for an experimental period because of the delay met with in obtaining the admission of sick persons to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. Laboratory Service The epidemiological service has been considerably improved by the establishment at the Park Hospital of a laboratory in association with the Public Health Laboratory Service. This laboratory is not only able to carry out the large number of bacteriological examinations which would be required in any serious outbreak of infectious disease but is also able to assist in the field work necessary in tracing the source of infection. In addition it is possible to increase the number of samples of food sent for bacteriological examination in efforts to improve the standards of food supplied to the public. It has however been thought advisable to continue the laboratory facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, for the examination of swabs and other specimens sent by general practitioners. It is possible at this laboratory to continue a week-end service and it is also considered important that the general practitioner should be encouraged to consult the pathologist personally. With the increasing complexity of bacteriological examinations, consultation is advisable if proper weight in each case is to be given to bacteriological and clinical findings rather than that too much reliance should be placed on a printed report and it is thought that such consultation is more likely to be fostered if the laboratory is in the area where the doctors have their practices. 35 Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves both the Boroughs as does the coroner's court at Greenwich. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, approximately doubled. The number of bodies received during 1949 was 557 and of these 119 were residents of Deptford. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. This Section came into being on the 5th July, 1948, and nine persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1949. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions The power of the Council to remove aged, infirm or physically incapacitated persons living in insanitary conditions and needing care and attention was previously vested in the Public Health (London) Act. From 5th July, 1948, this power was revoked and re-enacted under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act. During 1949 it was not found necessary to take any action to remove any such person. Shops Act, 1934 In the course of their routine inspections the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Slaughter Houses Two slaughter houses are licensed in this Borough but were not in use during the year. Swimming Baths At the baths maintained by the Borough Council a chlorination plant is installed and periodical sampling is conducted to ensure that a high standard of water purity is maintained. Examinations show that the bacteriological purity is normally similar to that of good drinking water.
