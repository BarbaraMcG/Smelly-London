Office White horse street, Commercial Road East, E. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Report upon various matters which have engaged the attention of the Hoard during the period from Lady-day, 1895, to Lady-day, 1896. QUEEN CATHERINE COURT AREA. Since the date of the last Report considerable progress has been made with regard to the acquisition of this Area, notwithstanding the fact that the freeholder and lessee of premises in Brook Street presented petitions in opposition to the scheme. In consequence of these petitions it was necessary for the Local Government Board to obtain an Act confirming the Scheme, and the same received the Royal Assent in July last. 42 The copyhold interests in Nos. 1, 2, 3. & 4. Little Queen Catherine Court and in Nos. 103 and 105, Brook Street, with forge and premises in the rear, have been purchased, and agreements have been entered into for the purchase of the following:— 103 and 105, Brook Street, and premises in the rear (leasehold interests). 1 to 8, Queen Catherine Court, freehold. 7 and 8, Little Queen Catherine Court, copyhold. 1, 2, 3, 4& 5, Susannah Row, and 31, Dorset Street, freehold. In December last a letter was received from the Assistant Solicitor of the London County Council, calling attention to the fact that the Hoard could only defray out of borrowed money payments for purchase money and compensation, while other capital expenditure could only be met out of the current rates of the year, and that the Council were in the same position so far as their contribution was concerned, and suggesting that application should be made to the Local Government Hoard for an order modifying the Scheme so as to enable the Board and the Council to defray all capital expenditure out of borrowed money, and such application was made accordingly. NORTH METROPOLITAN RAILWAY AND CANAL. BILL. In December last I laid before the Hoard a plan and book of reference deposited by the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company with respect to a proposed application to Parliament for power to carry out certain works in the District, which were referred to the Works Committee. The Board resolved to dissent from the Company's Scheme. The Surveyor afterwards had an interview with the Chief Engineer of the London County Council, and an Assistant to Mr. J. Woolf Barry, the Company's Engineer, attended tic-fore the Committee, and explained the works which it was proposed to carry out, and promised to submit certain suggestions of the Committee for his consideration. The Surveyor subsequently reported the understanding which had been arrived at with reference to bridges and time for acquisition of 43 land and construction of works, and the Hoard agreed to offer no opposition to the Hill if the Company would agree to make a diagonal road as suggested in place of the proposed new though fare from Narrow Street to Medland Street, and I was authorised to instruct Parliamentary Agents to take steps to obtain the insertion in the Company's Bill of thr necessary clauses for the protection of the Board's intercuts. The necessary petition to the House of Commons was accordingly prepared and presented. The Surveyor afterwards had interviews with the Chief Engineer of the London County Council, and the Engineer of the Company, especially in regard to the formation of the proposed new street from Narrow Street to Me Hand Street, and was informed that the Company were not willing to carry out the work as suggested by the Board, and that they were prepared to abandon that portion of the scheme upon certain conditions confining the Hill to the northern scheme of removing the locks under Commercial Road Bridge and building the locks under the Salmon Lane Bridge. It was therefore only necessary to prepare clauses for insertion in the Bill to protect the interest of the Hoard with regard to the two matters referred to. This was done and the Clauses were inserted in the Bill. NARROW STREET, RATCLIFF. IMPROVEMENT. In April last I was requested to attend the sale by Auction of the freehold premises. No. 39. Narrow Street, Ratcliff, and to endeavour to purchase the same at a cost not exceeding £600, with a view to the widening of the thoroughfare. I accordingly attended the sale, and agreed to purchase the property for the sum of £440, and the purchase was subsequently completed. The Surveyor was then directed to prepare and make a report with reference to the purchase of portions of Nos. 41, 43, 45 and 47, Narrow Street, with a view to the suggested widening of that thoroughfare, and to see the representatives of the owners ot the premises with a view to negotiating with them. 44 The Board subsequently agreed (subject to the London County Council sanctioning the improvement) to purchase for the sum of £750 the piece of land colored pink on the plan prepared by the Surveyor, and forming the site of the front parts of the premises: the land colored yellow on such plan, part of the site of No 39, Narrow Street, being conveyed to the vendors as part of the consideration for the purchase of their property, and an agreement to carry this out is now being prepared. The London County Council have been asked to sanction the proposed widening and contribute one-half of the cost but no reply has yet been received. OLD SEWER ON BOUNDARY BETWEEN POPLAR AND LIMEHOUSE. The Surveyor hiving reported that the old sewer on the boundary between Poplar and Limehouse on the north side of the old Rope Ground in the rear of certain premises in Park Strect, was in a defective condition, and a letter having been received from the Poplar District Hoard asking whether the Board would contribute one-half the cost of filling up the old sswer and of forming a new pipe sewer in lieu thereof, and also in regard to a proposal to extenJ the wall built over the existing sewer to the bottom of the same clear of the suggested pipe sewer, the Works Committee, after inspecting the sewer, recommended the Board to consent to to the extension of the said wall as suggested, and to contribute one half of the cost of filling in the old sewer and forming in lieu thereof a 15-in. pipe sewer on the Poplar side of the old sewer, the estimated cost being £"100, and to be jointly responsible with the Poplar Board for the repair and maintenance of the said new pipe sewer in the same manner as was the case with regard to the old sewer, and that in the event of the owner of the wall making any claim for compensation for damage to his premises in consequence of the defective condition of the old sewer, such claim l»e dealt with by the Board and the Poplar Board jointly, and that an agreement be prepared by the Poplar District Board emlxxlying the arrangement referred to. The lioard adopted the recommendation, and such agreement was accordingly prepared and sealed, and the work has has been carried out. 45 NAVAL CONTRACTS. In consequence of a letter from the Ratcliff Vestry asking the co-operation of other East End Boards and Vestries in appealing to the Government to give some portion of their Naval Contracts to East End Shipbuilders, with a view to the relief of distress during the coming winter, the Board agreed to co-operate in such appeal and a letter was addressed to Mr. H. S. Samuel, M.P., asking him to bring the matter before the Government. Mr. Samuel replied detailing the steps he had already adopted by interviewing the Admiralty Authorities, and it was then resolved that the East End District Boards and Vestries be invited to appoint Delegates to attend a conference at the Limehouse Town 11 all to discuss the question, and that the Members of Parliament, and Members of the Lon1on County Council for East End constituencies be also invited to be present. The Conference was held at the Limehouse Town Hall on Thursday, 30th January, at 4 p.m., and the following resolutions were passed, viz. "That this Meeting of Members of Parliament and of "the London County Council, representing constituencies in "the East and South East of London, and of Delegates from "the several District Boards, Vestries, and Boards of Guard"tans in those localities which are directly concerned in the "Shipbuilding Industries of the Port of London, and represent"ing a population of upwards of 2,000,000, respectfully "requests Her Majesty's Government to consider their claim "to a share of future Naval Contracts." "And we further desire to enter our protest against the "action of the Admiralty in withdrawing the clause 'current "rate of wages in the District,' from the fair wages contract, "and respectfully ask for its reinsertion; and further ask that "in all future contracts the difference in the rates of wages "prevailing in a particular district shall be taken into considera"tion by the Admiralty in allocating the Shipbuilding Con"tracts." 46 A copy of the resolutions passed at such Conference was afterwards forwarded to the First Lord of the Admiralty, with a request that he would receive a deputation. On the 17th March, a deputation waited upon Mr. Goschen, the First Lord of the Admiralty, but from his reply there was little reason to hope that a share of such Contracts would be given to East London Shipbuilders. BEN JONSON ROAD IMPROVEMENT. At the date of the last Annual Report I was requested to see the Parliamentary Agent of the London County Council, with a view to getting certain alterations made in their Bill giving power to effect the above, but it was understood that if such alterations could not be made no opposition was to be offered. The Parliamentary Agent could not agree to one of the aberrations, and the Act was passed, and in July last a letter was received from the Council asking whether it was desired that the powers of the Council should be transferred to the Board and the Vestry of Mile End Old Town, as provided by the Act. With reference to the above letter from the London County Council, a letter was received from the Mile End Vestry stating that they had resolved that the matter be left in the hands of the Council to carry out the improvement. The Board thereupon directed that a t letter be addressed to the Vestry, stating that it was always under* stood that the Improvement should lie carried out by the Vestry and 1 the Board jointly, and suggesting that a conference should be held with the Vestry to consider the matter. To this the Vestry replied that they saw no reason to alter their resolution to leave the carrying out of the improvement in the hands of the London County Council, and therefore thought the proposed conference unnecessary. The Board, after considering the above, directed that a letter be addressed to the Council again, stating that it was always understood before the Act was passed that the Improvement should be carried out by the Board and the Mile End Vestry jointly, and that 47 the Vestry had now come to a contrary decision without communicating with the Board, and also asking what would be the position of the matter if the Board declined to request the Council to carry out the work. The Council replied on the 20th November last, that as the Board and the Mile End Vestry did not appear to be in agreement as to the course to he pursued, the Improvements Committee had resellved to recommend the Council to undertake the work. It was then resolved that the lioard reply to the Council in these terms:— That there was direct agreement made between the Mile End Vestry and this Board that the Improvement should be carried out by the Board and the Vestry jointly at a cost of from £4,000 to £5,000 as estimated by the Surveyors of the lioard and the Vestry and approved by those bodies, and that in the event of the Council earning out the work without the consent of the Hoard, the Board would ignore all liability in the matter, and a copy of such letter to the Council was forwarded to Messrs. i'earce and Leon, the members for Limehouse. Messrs. Pearce and Leon wrote on the 4th December, stating that the London County Council had adjourned the question until the 10th inst., in the hope that the opportunity might be used by the Board and the Vestry for coming to an agreement. It was resolved that as a matter of urgency the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of Works, Sanitary, and Finance Committees, together with Mr. Smith, be appointed a Committee to deal with the matter in the event of any further development taking place before the next meeting and that the Mile End Vestry be at once I informed of the course adopted by the Board. The thanks of the Board were at the same time accorded to Mr. Pearce and Mr. Leon for their services in obtaining the postponement of the question by the London County Council. On the 18th December a letter was received from the Mile End Vestry stating that they adhered to their previous resolutions upon this subject. 48 On the 19th February a letter was read from the London County Council with copy report of the Council's Solicitor, as to the powers of the Council, and stating that it had been decided not to take any definite action in the matter for one month, in order that the Board might have an opportunity of making any further observations. The following resolution was then passed "That this Board is, as it always has been, perfectly "ready to carry out its obligations and its agreements with "the London County Council on the one part and the Mile "End Vestry on the other in the carrying out of this Scheme, "and that the Council be informed that the Mile End Vestry "having declined to meet the Board to endeavour to come to "an arrangement in the matter the Board re-affirm their "derision not to contribute to the co t of the Improvement "unless the same is carried out by the Board and Vestry "jointly." STREET NOMENCLATURE. Orders have been made by the London County Council as follows, viz.:— For re-numbering the houses in Well Street, Upper East Smithfield. For re-naming Ilarad's Alley, Wellclose Square, '• H.11.id's Place." For re-numbering the houses and premises in South Street, Limehouse. For re-numbering certain houses in White Horse Street. PLAVlNO FIELDS. On the 8th January last a letter was read from the London County Council asking for a return giving particulars of vacant lands suitable for playing fields in the District, and in reply thereto I was directed to furnish particulars of Mr. Ellis's brickfields at the rear of the houses on the North side of Dixon Street, stating that the same is about ij acres in extent, and that the Hoard are informed that Mr. Ellis's lease of the land will expire in two years. 49 EAST LONDON WATER WORKS COMPANY. A letter was read from the East London Water Works Company Mating that in consequence of the unprecedented drought and excessive consumption of water it was necessary to shut off the water from the service mains during a portion of the night until the constant supply could be resumed. The Hoard directed that a copy of the letter be forwarded to the London County Council and that a letter be addressed to the Company calling attention to the inconvenience caused in certain parts of the District by the fact that the water was not turned on until 8 a.m., and asking that it might in future he turned on at 6 a.m. On the 24th July, the Company gave notice that in consequence of the unprecedented and continuous drought it was necessary to materially curtail the supply of water, and they asked that the greatest economy might be exercised in the use of water for road watering, and I was directed to write the Company requesting them to give public notice of the hours when the water would be turned on and off. and if possible to give instructions for the supply to be for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. I was also directed to write to the Thanvs Conservancy, and request them to permit water to l»e taken from the river for the purpose of watering the streets should such a course become necessary. The Company forwarded a statement of the circumstances under which it had lieen found necessary to diminish the hours of supply, and it was left to the Surveyor to exercise his discretion as to whether the road watering should l»e continued, and a copy of the Water Company's statement was sent to the Local Government Hoard together with a letter detailing the whole of the facts and pointing out the position of things and the danger caused to the health and life of the inhabitants of the District. A copy was also sent to the London County Council, and the Council was requested to furnish the Hoard with their views with regard thereto. At a meeting on the 11th September, the Chairman reported that during the recess a letter was received from the Hackney 50 Vestry inviting the Hoard to appoint five delegates to attend a Conference, and that under the circumstances he had done so, and as the result of a deputation to the President of the Loral Government Hoard, that Board had decided to institute a Public Inquiry. The action of the Chairman was approved and the Delegates nominated by him were constituted a Committer and empowered to appear at the Inquiry and to give such evidence thereat as they might consider expedient. The Inquiry was held at the Hackney Town Hall on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th October, and the Inspector's Report was summarized as follows:— I. That the scarcity of water in the East London Water Company's area during the summer of 1895 was due to the following causes:— (a.) 14 Exceptional waste, beyond the undue waste of "ordinary years, of water owing (1) to non-repair "of fractures in the consumers' pipes brought "about during the unusually long and severe "frost of the previous winter; and (a) to ex"cessive garden watering during the drought "in May and June." (b) "Decrease in the volume of the River Lee due "to the unprecedented drought which occurred "during the first six months of 1895." (c.) "Means of storage possessed by the Mast London "Water Company inadequate to enable them to " meet the combined waste and deficiency of " water noted under headings (a) and (b)." "We would also note under this heading that in our opinion "the inconvenience experienced by consumers was much aggravated by the want of proper means for domestic storage of " water." II. "That although the scarcity of water undoubtedly gave "rise to considerable inconvenience and hardship there is no "evidence to show that it had any appreciable deleterious "influence upon the public health within the area of the East "London Water Company." 51 III.-(a.) "That steps have already been taken by the "East London Water Company which should in our opinion "afford sufficient storage of water to meet any deficiency in the "supply of water within their district for many years to come." (b.) "That for the protection of the consumer against "unavoidable temporary intermissions of the supply, we consider "that there would be distinct advantage in having properly "designed means for storage of water in houses." On the 4th March, 1896, the Board approved the Report of a Committee in the following terms:— "That having carefully considered the Report of the "Local Government Hoard's Inspectors on the alleged failure "of the East London W iter Supply in the Summer of 1895, "they regretted to find that the same was equivalent to an ex"oneration of the Company, and were of opinion that abundance "of evidence was produced at the Inquiry to clearly prove that "the Company was responsible to a very great extent for the "short supply caused by the mains not being laid at a sufficient "depth to protect from frost and to prevent them bursting, in "consequence of which great Waste of water occurred, and the "Committee further considered that the action of the Company "in lowering their mains in the District since the Inquiry, was, " in Itself, proof that the Company recognised the fact that such " mains were not previously laid at a sufficient depth, and the "Committee regretted that the provision of storage cisterns "was recommended in the Report, although the medical "gentlemen who gave evidence at the Inquiry were unanim"ously of opinion that the use of such cisterns was dangerous "to health." In December a letter was received from the London County Council asking the support of the Board to a proposed Bill to require the East London Water Works Company to supply water constantly at such a pressure as would make the water reach the top story of the highest houses within their limits of supply, and the Board agreed to support such Bill. 52 COUNTY COUNCIL POWERS AND MAIN ROADS. In January last a letter was received from the London County Council inviting the Board to appoint two representatives to attend a Conference to consider what powers now possessed by the Council should be transferred to the Local Authorities. Messrs. Mills and Smith were accordingly appointed, and on the 5th February Mr. Smith made a report as to the proceedings at the Conference. It appeared that the Conference had resolved that the maintenance of Disturnpiked Roads should be vested in the Local Authorities, and Mr. Smith pointed out that if the law were altered to that effect the Board would no longer receive the contribution of £1,410 per year from the Council in respect of the cost of maintaining such roads. It was resolved that the Chairman, together with the Clerk and Surveyor, be requested to draw up a motion to be submitted to the next Meeting of the Conference by the Delegates appointed by the Board to the effect that no resolutions passed at the Conference respecting the maintenance of main roads shall affect the contribution of the County Council to the maintenance of disturnpiked roads in the Limehouse District. LIMEHOUSE STATION. Several complaints having been made of the dirty condition of Limehouse Station, and also to the want of proper accommodation thereat. I was directed on the 19th February last to call the attention of the Great Eastern Railway there to. WIDENING OF BREWHOUSE LANE. WAPPING. On the 4th March, 1896, a letter was received from Mr. Roberts, the Surveyor to the Governors of Bridewell Hospital, suggesting that the Board should widen Brewhouse Lane, Wapping, by throwing into the public way a piece of land belonging to the Governors, and which they were willing to surrender for the sum of £75. After considering the matter the Hoard decided not to accept the suggestion as Brewhouse Lane was a by street, but that if the Governors would throw into the public way the piece of land colored pink on the plan for a nominal consideration the Hoard would undertake to pave and maintain the same. 53 RIGHT OF WAY OVER BOWLES' WHARF. A letter was received on the 8th May last, from Messrs. Bean and Co., on behalf of the trustees of the Rev. F. A. Bowles, asking for the removal of the notice put up by the Board in Broad Street, Ratcliff, respecting the right of way over Howies* Wharf to the river, and alleging that no such right of way existed. After a good deal of correspondence I was directed, on the 24th July to reply to a further letter from Messrs. Bean & Co., that there is a public right of way over the Wharf, and that the Board therefore decline to remove the notice board announcing the existence of the same. which board is fixed on the front of premises in Broad Street over the entrance to the right of way. On the 18th March last the Surveyor reported that the owners of Bowles Wharf having taken up the paving of a portion of the right of way running from Broad-street to the River Thames, and repaved the same, he had called the attention of the a. • its of thr |.in lor I to th«- fact that they ha I interfered with the pt 'i*rt\ of the Hard, and removed the same without sanction, and in reply the agents had informed him that in their opinion there was no such ri^ht (if way. As it was advisable that the question should l»e clean 1 up, he suggeste 1 that the wime lie referred to the W orks Committee, which was done accordingly. LIMEHOUSE CHURCHYARD. In June last the attention of the Board was called to the disgraceful condition of Limehouse Churchyard, and 1 was directed to write to the London County Council and request them to confer with the Church wardens of Limehouse as to the best course to adopt. In December last a letter was received from the London County Council stating that it had been suggested that £470 should be expended in the improvement of the Churchyard, and asking what proportion the Board would contribute in the event of a faculty being obtained to secure the ground for the use of the public for ever. 54 The Board considered the matter, and the Council were informed that the Hoard would be prepared to contribute one half of £470, subject to the ground being secured for the use of the public for ever, and that the Council be recommended at the same time to endeavour to obtain power to widen the Commercial Road East, between the Town Hall and Three Colt Street at its own cost. CHANCERY PLACE WIDENING. Application has been made to the London County Council to widen Chancery Place, High Street. Shadwell, but thev declined to do so. SMELTERS. Letters were received from the Whitechapel District Board and the Wandsworth Union in favour of the promotion of legislation to place all shelters, including Salvation Army Shelters, under the provisions of the Common Lodging House Acts, and the Hoard directed that a memorial be presented to the Local Government Board, urging the promotion of legislation with the object referred to. ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. In July last a notice was received from the Capital and Counties Electric Supply Co., Ltd., of their intention to apply to the Hoard of Trade for a Provisional Order authorising the Company to supply electricity within the district, but the Company did not proceed further in the matter. RAILWAY PASSENGER TRAFFIC. In September last I was directed to write to the Great Eastern Railway Company and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway Company, calling attention to the inconvenience caused to passengers by the fact that the up trains of the latter Company called at Burdett Road and Stepney Stations for the purpose of setting down but not taking up passengers, and asking whether arrangements could be made for passengers to travel to the City by such trains. 55 In reply the Managing Director of the London Tilbury and Southend Railway wrote stating that as the question was one of some difficulty in its financial details, and the Great Eastern service was so frequent. it had been decided to leave matters as they were. The further consideration of the same was deferred until the receipt of a letter from the Great Eastern Railway upon the subject. PROPOSED NEW THOROUGHFARES. The question of the suggested formation of a new thoroughfare from Broad Street to Brook Street, and from Broad Street to Cranford Street has again engaged the attention of the Works Committee, and the further Consideration there of has been deferred. COMBINED DRAINAGE. In consequence of the unsatisfactory state of the law on this question, it having been decided that where several houses were drained by one drain without the consent of the Local Authority, such drain became thereby a sewer, and repairable by such Authority, a conference of District Boards and Vestries was held at the Holborn Town Hall, and I attended several meetings, and in the result a Bill was prepared and introduced into Parliament to alter the law. The Islington Vestry afterwards wrote urging the Board to apply to the London County Council to support the Bill, and they were written to accordingly. Mr. H. S. Samuel, M.P. for the Limehouse Division was also asked to do so. 56 NEW MORTUARY. CORONER'S COURT. &c. An agreement having been come to with the owners of the site in Horseferry Branch-road, the purchase thereof was duly completed, the London County Council having advanced on loan a sum of £2,300 for defraying the cost of the portion of the site to be utilised for the Mortuaries, Post-mortem Room. Disinfecting Chambers and Incinerator. The Sarveyor prepared the necessary plans and specifications and the Board accepted the tender of Mr. J. H. Johnson, builder, of Limehouse, for the erection of the buildings, and the works are now in progress. The London County Council have advanced the following amounts on loan for defraying the expense to be incurred, viz.:- Disinfecting Chambers; apparatus for disinfection, destruction, and removal of infected articles; and post mortem room £ 3000 Mortuaries and Caretaker's house 1845 In January last the Mortuary, &c. Building Committee reported that they had considered a letter from the London County Council offering to take the Coroner's Court on a lease for a term of 21 years at a rental of £120 per annum, and that having heard the report of the Surveyor thereon they were of opinion that the offer was inadequate, and had requested him to endeavour to come to an arrangement with the Council for the payment of an increased rental. Further negotiations accordingly took place, and ultimately the Council offered to take a 21 years' lease of the use of the Court at a rental of £175 per annum, and the offer has been accepted by the Board. KING JOHN's COURT AREA. The Surveyor was in communication with the Superintending Architect of the London County Council with regard to the plans for the improvement of this area under the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and had several interviews 57 with him upon the subject. Several amendments and modifications were made in the plans, and they arc still under the consideration of the Council. I am. Gentlemen. Your obedient Servant, SIDNEY G.
