THE Clebenth Annual Report of the proceedings of THE VESTRY OF ST. MARTIN-IN-THE-FIELDS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1867. In conformity with the 198th Section of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the following Report of the affairs and business of the Vestry during the past year, accompanied by an Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure, duly audited as required by the Act, is shown. Vestry Meetings and Committees. The Return attached to this Report will show that the Vestry has held 30 meetings, and the Committees appointed by the Vestry have held 48 meetings during the year. Leicester Square. The question as to the appropriation of the centre 6 of Leicester Square, is still undecided. The Special Case has not yet been heard, and in the meantime the Metropolitan Board of Works, have, under the provisions of the Gardens in Towns Act, enlarged the time for the inhabitants to agree upon the steps to be hereafter taken, for an additional period of six months. Parliamentary Measures. The present Session has introduced one or two measures for consideration, having reference to the Local Management, and also to the traffic of the Metropolis. A Committee of the House of Commons, of which Mr. Ayrton, was Chairman, has examined numerous witnesses on the subject of the general management of the Metropolis, under the Local Management Act of the year 1855, and other Acts. That evidence has reference to the advantages as well as the defects of the present system ; and points out various remedies to be applied, by strengthening the authority of the Vestries and District Boards. I was one of the witnesses examined before the Committee. Reports of the evidence have been printed. It remains to be seen whether any and what steps will be hereafter taken, founded on that evidence. The matter will be carefully watched, so that the Vestry may have early intimation of anything of importance that may take place. Sanitary Measures. The Medical Officer's Report is attached, showing the sanitary state of the parish, and the steps taken to improve it during the past year. In connection therewith the Vestry have caused 7 136 notices for abatement of nuisances to be served during the past year, and 26 summonses have been issued to compel the inhabitants to abate the nuisances complained of. In all the other cases the noticcs have been complied with. Surveyor's Report. Under this head, all the works done under the direction of the Vestry will appear. Conclusion. Bound up with the Annual Report will be found a detailed account of the Receipts aud Expenditure of the rents and dividends belonging to the Alms Fund in this parish devoted to charitable purposes, and distributed by the Churchwardens in the support of Alms Women and Out-Pensioners elected by the Vestry.

Report on the Health ot the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields for the Year 18GG. In the year 1866, there have been 571 births and 566 deaths. 205 of the deaths occurred iu children under the age of live years, and 124- in persons over sixty years. There have been 82 deaths from zymotic diseases, which is much below the usual average. We have had two deaths only from smallpox, although this disease has been so prevalent that the SmallpoxHospital has been found quite inefficient to receive more than a very small proportion of the cases which have occurred in the Metropolis during the last year. The consequence has been, that the infection has been necessarily retained in the confined habitations of the poor, and the disease has spread to a very great extent. Nothing can show more decidedly the wisdom of having Hospitals large enough to receive all cases of infectious diseases. No institutions are so much needed as a sufficient number of Hospitals in different districts of our overcrowded city, for the reception of cases of smallpox, fever, and other contagious diseases, because by such means alone can we hope to limit the spread of these disorders. In the year 1865 there were 99 deaths from zymotic c 18 diseases; in 1866 there have been 82, which number includes 9 cases of cholera, and 24 of diarrhoea. We have reason to believe that our sanitary inspections, increased attention to cleanliness, ventilation, drainage, &c., have operated beneficially in limiting the propagation of these diseases. Nearly all the cholera cases which occurred last year in our parish were isolated, occurring in different parts of the district, in single cases, without spreading the infection. In only two instances did the disease extend beyond the original case. The parish was very vigilantly inspected, and the result was, that we not only had few cases of cholera, but our list of deaths from other epidemic diseases was much below the average. The increasing interest of the public in questions relating to sanitary laws must be very obvious to all. It is very desirable that it should be so; the more we can enlighten the public mind on the true objects of medical science the better, not only for the public, but also for medical practitioners, because our just influence must increase with an increase of the capability of right judgment of all on medical subjects. The law.^ by which disease is prevented, and health improved, arc of more real importance than the treatment of disease when it has taken place ; for the preventive laws show that very similar means to those which prevent are of great importance in the cure, and the whole subject is thus rendered more rational and more comprehensible, as well as more beneficial. I regret that my recommendation to carry out the 35th Section of the Public Health Act of 1866 was objected to by the Vestry. At the same time I must admit that the objection to doing so was grounded on an important difficulty; that the ejected for overcrowding find it almost an impossibility to obtain lodgings. All landlords object to receive a large family ; and the difficulty of obtaining house-room where there are 19 many children is fast becoming an impossibility, and not without reason, for the most destructive part of our population is the juvenile ; they set no value on closet doors, windows, water-butts anil cistcrns, they destroy more and necessitate more repairs than all the rest of the community. When we look at some of our worst courts, it does seem probable, that if the present old and ill-contrivcd houses were removed and replaced by others better planned and arranged, with fewer staircascs, larger and more convenient rooms, that the primary expenditure would lie met with a sufficiently increased amount of rent. Brewer's Court seems a very likely place for such au experiment, which I caunot help thinking, if judiciously carried out, would be remunerative to the proprietor, and a great boon to our working population. There can lxr no doubt that the death-rate of the Metropolis will be much diminished when the closebuilt courts arc replaced by modern improvements. In conscqucnce of the demolition of so many houses in St. Clement's Danes for the building of the Law Courts, the population of Bedfordbury and its purlieus has been very much increased, certainly without being improved. The yards and staircases are frequently in a very bad state, and require the utmost vigilance of our energetic Inspector to have them kept in any decent state. K 20 Table No. 1.
