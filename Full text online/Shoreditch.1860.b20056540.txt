THE MEDICAL OFFICER REPORTS AS FOLLOWS: The following Report embraces the civil year 1860, a period adopted for convenience of comparison with the Sanitary statistics of the Registrar-General, relating to other parts of the metropolis and the kingdom; it also embraces the year included between March 31st, 1860, and March 31st, 1861, being the municipal year indicated by the Metropolis Local Management Act. In Table I., are set forth in detail, the causes of deaths, distributed according to ages, for the year 1860. In Table II., the causes of deaths in each of the four quarters of the year 1860, are distinguished; and the causes of deaths during the first quarter of 1861, are set forth side by side with the four quarters of 1860. The mortality from any particular cause, and the gross mortality for the year ending with March, 1861, may thus be readily ascertained. The Census taken on the 8th April last, is an event of great interest when regarded from a sanitary point of view. By restoring the exact account of the population as determined by enumeration, we are enabled to test and correct the mortality-estimates of former years; to take an accurate departure for the present year; and to calculate upon more proximate data the death-rates of the ensuing years. It will be desirable to lay down in the first instance, those facts which the recent census supplies as the foundation of our local sanitary statistics. The population of the entire metropolis in 1851 amounted to 2,362,236 persons. In 1861 it had added 4-40,798 persons, raising the population to 2,803,034. The rate of increase in these ten years was 18.66 percent. The annual rate of increase was 1.722 percent. The annual rate of increase during the ten years, between the Census of 1841 and 1851, was 1.975 per cent. The Metropolitan rate of increase has fallen off, although the absolute gain is enormous. 11 The population of Shoreditch amounted to 83,432 persons in 1841; it had risen to 109,257 in 1851, having increased at the rate of nearly 3 per cent. per annum, growing by one per cent. faster than the Metropolis. At the Census of 1861, the population amounted to 129,339 persons, gaining 20,082 persons, a gain in itself equal to the whole population of a considerable town. The rate of increase was therefore 18.38 per cent. in the interval between the two Censuses, or about 1.7 per cent. annually. It will thus be seen that Shoreditch has not maintained the rate of increase of 1841—51; during the last decenniad the district has even fallen in this respect slightly behind the Metropolis. The population of Shoreditch (1861) is .046, or about 1 in 22 of the London popnlation, i.e. Shoreditch multiplied by 22 would about equal London. These relations of Shoreditch to the Metropolis are useful as furnishing standards of comparison for all health and mortality-movements. Thus, we may expect that week by week, month by month, and year by year, the mortality of Shoreditch, in the aggregate and from special classes of diseases, shall bear the same proportion to the mortality of London—i. e. 1 in 22—as is borne by the population. Whenever any marked variations from this proportion are observed, we shall be supplied with an indication for enquiry into the special causes,' whether connected with the ages, proportions of the sexes, or occupations of the populations, or with local sanitary conditions. In preceding annual reports, I have assumed that the population of Shoreditch was increasing after the annual rate of increase which marked the period between 1841 and 1851. After the latter year, this rate, as we now see by the recent Census, has not been maintained. I had therefore arrived at an estimated population which was somewhat in excess of the actual population. Since it now appears that the tendency of the district is to increase not only at a lesser annual rate, but also probably in a diminishing ratio year by year, it will be safer to adopt a very moderate of increase in forming an estimate of the population in 1862, and future years. There are causes now in operation, such as the demolition of old courts and isolated houses, which must largely counteract the tendency to increase. The vacant building area is already much reduced, and the time seems approaching when compression or crowding in the old-inhabited parts reaching its limits, the population in them will remain 12 stationary or even recede. I propose to multiply the population year by year, by 1.0147, the figure adopted by the Registrar-General for the Metropolis at large. It is unnecessary to remind you that the parish has grown very unequally in its different parts. The parish may be divided into two districts, the old and the new. The first portion embracing the registration sub-districts of Holywell and St. Leonard, have actually suffered a diminution of inhabitants, thus throwing all the gain of 20,000 persons into the four remaining districts, of Hoxton New Town, Hoxton Old Town, and Ilaggerstone West and East. In order to show more clearly the march of the population in the different divisions, I place before you A Table exhibiting the population of each Registration Sub-District, in 1841, 1851, and 1861. Area in acres 1841 1851 1861 Increase of Decrease in 1851-61 Rates of Increase per cent, in ten years. Holywell 68 16740 17245 17314 Increase 69 Nearly stationary St. Leonard 75 17987 19449 19184 Decrease 265 Receding Hoxton New Town 130 15777 23505 26505 Increase 3000 .128 Hoxton Old Town 116 14022 17431 25772 Do. 8341 .480 Haggerstone West 132 12037 20276 23257 Do. 2981 .147 Haggerstone East 125 6998 11351 17307 Do. 5956 .524 All Shoreditch 646 83432 109257 129339 20347 265 Increase 20082 It is thus seen that whilst during the last 20 years the number of inhabitants in Holywell and St. Leonard's has undergone little change, Hoxton New Town has increased during the last ten years, about 1J per cent., Haggerstone West about 1^ per cent., Hoxton Old Town nearly 50 per cent., and Ilaggerstone East more than 50 per cent. Whence is this increase of population derived? If we could find a community—self-sufficing, never sending any of its members abroad into the world, and admitting no new-comers within its pale, then we could measure the increase or loss of population by simply striking a balance 13 between the births and deaths But the question in a rapidly-fluctuating town-population is far more complex. In Shoreditch there has been a ceaseless ebb and flow of emigration and immigration. In 110 one year are we dealing with the same population as during the preceding year. We may indeed be administering to the sanitary needs of the same number, or of a steadily growing number of inhabitants. But the individual component parts of the population are far from being the same. This ever proceding change defies accurate tracing; and to a certain extent vitiates many conclusions, and disturbs many comparisons in vital statistics. During the ten years running from 1851 to 1861, the aggregate excess of births over deaths amounted to 18,402, a number approaching the total increase of population. But it would be very unsafe to conclude that the difference between this excess and the total increase is solely accounted for by immigration. It is the resultant of many complicated movements. Between 1841 and 1851, the relations between the excess of births over deaths, and of the excess of population above the gain in births were very different. Thus the excess of births over deaths was only 11060, leaving 14636 persons to be accounted for as the balance of migration movements. It may be inferred that during these ten years the influx of new comers in Shoreditch was at its height; and that during the last ten years, the district has been acquiring a more settled character. % The population now consists of 61,832 males, and 67,507 females, shewing an excess of 5672 females. The excess of females is much greater in some other districts of London. The staple trade of Shoreditch, comprising various dealings and manufactures in wood, creates a large demand for male labour, whilst the proportion of female domestic servants is probably less than in some other districts. In 1851. In 1861. The inhabited houses numbered 17,231 The uninhabited ditto 584 The building ditto 38 The gross-mortalily in the year ending on the 29th day of December, 1860, amounted to 2970. It will be useful to apply the primary test of 14 the absolute and proportional number of deaths during the successive years which have been passed under the administration of the Metropolis Local Management Act. In the following table, the population is calculated by multiplying by 1.017, the rate of increase now ascertained to have operated since 1851. A. D. Population Deaths Proportion to Persons living. 1855 116772 2998 1 in 39 1856 118757 2719 1 in 40 1857 122826 2955 1 in 35 1858 124916 3180 1 in 38 6 1859 127039 2922 1 in 43-0 1860 129339 2970 1 in 43 0 The steady and marked progression towards a high health-standard displayedinthis table, cannot fail to be exceedingly gratifying. That this improvement of the health of the community has been achieved in the face of the accumulating difficulties arising from a rapidly enlarging population, is the most convincing proof of the energy and efficiency with which the sanitary administration of the district has been carried on by the Vestry. Had the mortality continued during the last three years at the rate which it had previously maintained, namely, of 1 death out of every 35 persons living, not 9072 persons but 10901 would have perished. To have saved 1829 lives, in three years, in all human probability by the steady application of hygienic measures, is a striking and encouraging fact. To have effected this saving of human life might well justify an extraordinary expenditure of money. But if it be shown, as I believe it may, that it has not involved any extraordinary expenditure, and that in various directions, to say nothing of increased comfort, and greater enjoyment of life, a greater productiveness of wealth has been created or fostered, the most sceptical must admit that a vigorous sanitary administration is not only a high moral duty, but also one that recommends itself on political and economical principles. The Mortality of 1860.—I will now make a summary analysis of the causes of death in 1800. Small-Pox, which raged so severely in 1859, 15 proving fatal to 87 persons, last year destroyed only 23 persons; 90 persons, all children, died of Measles; 73 of Scarlatina, against 185 in 1859; 118 of Whooping-Cough; 94 of Fever, this number however, including 13 Fever cases dying in St. Luke's Workhouse, in 1859, 108 persons died of Fever; Erysipelas was fatal to 18 persons; ChildbedFever destroyed 7 persons; Diarrhoea was assigned as the cause of death in 76 cases, against 194 in 1859; and 21 deaths are ascribed to Diphtheria. These comprise all the deaths that can properly be attributed to epidemic or zymotic diseases, and which are held to be more especially connected with defective sanitary conditions. If we cast up all the deaths from this class of diseases for the purpose of comparing the year 1860 with preceding years, we find a total of 523 deaths in 1860, 756 in 1859, 821 in 1858, here again is a diminishing rate of mortality from preventive diseases, coming to confirm the conclusion drawn from the comparison of the gross mortality in successive years. Passing on to other diseases, and taking them in the order of their destructiveness, we first find Phthisis or lung-consumption, which carried off 347 persons, or 13 per cent. of all who died; next in the fatal list stands Bronchitis, which killed 341 persons, and if to this be added 263 deaths from Pneumonia, we obtain 604 deaths from lung-inflammations. In no previous year has the mortality from this cause risen so high. The figures for the last six years run as follows, 445, 426, 478, 508, 395, 604. The increase is therefore remarkable. It is scarcely necessary to remind you that it is attributable to the extraordinary severity and duration of the cold last year. This cause continued to operate severely during the first quarter of 1861, as may be seen by comparing the mortality of the several quarters in Table II. It is consolatory to observe that notwithstanding this excessive mortality from a cause which can only be partially mitigated by hygienic precautions, it was still insufficient to neutralise the large gain achieved by the diminution of zymotic diseases. BrainDiseases, including Apoplexy, destroyed 307 persons; to these may be added 133 deaths from Convulsions, all of these deaths being in children. The term "Convulsions" is often used indefinitely, and no doubt frequently covers some other cause. Scrofulous diseases cut off 151 persons. 143 deaths are vaguely attributed to Atrophy and Debility. Old Age was the end attained by 113 persons. 108 died of Heartdiseases. 86 persons died of various forms of violence, namely, of which 16 7 were eases of poisoning, and 11 of drowning. 67 infants perished within a short period of birth, their vitality being enfeebled either from being born prematurely, or from possessing malformation. Other causes of death call for no special remark. Several could not admit of fair comparison with other districts for this reason. Persons afflicted with some accidents or diseases apply to the hospitals in other parts of the metropolis. Their deaths arc thus registered elsewhere; and a reading of the mortality-tables of different districts might lead to the erroneous Conclusion that Ovarian Dropsy, Bright's-disease, and other fatal affections are of very rare occurrence in Shoreditch, and very prevalent in other parishes. It is proper however to observe, that although the absence of hospitals in this district necessarily disturbs the natural proportional distribution of diseases, it does not materially vitiate the aggregate death returns. The inclusion of St. Luke's Workhouse, in which institution 140 deaths occurred, of Hoxton House Asylum which admits patients from various parts of the country, and in which 25 persons died, and of an unusual proportion of Almshouses for the reception of aged people, quite compensate for the deaths of persons belonging to Shoreditch which took place in the various hospitals, prisons, and other public institutions situated beyond the district. Ages at Death.—In order to arrive at a fair conclusion regarding the proportion of deaths occurring at various epochs of life, it is necessary to be in possession of the numbers of persons living of the ages under consideration. This information I have at present no opportunity of obtaining. I can therefore only state the bare facts. During the year 775 children died under the age of 1 year, 656 more died whose age exceeded 1 year and was under 5. Alter the age of 5 years, the value of life is immensely increased. The children who have emerged with safety from the assaults of Small-Pox, Measles, Scarlatina, Whooping-Cough, Diarrhoea, Pneumonia, Convulsions, and other infantile disorders, may be presumed to be endowed with a more vigorous constitution, and have acquired greater powers of resistance to injurious external influences. Thus between 5 and 10 years only 93 children died; from 10 to 20 only 84 persons died. Between the ages of 20 and 40, 312 persons died; 442 died above 40 and under 60; whilst the fair proportion of 608 persons died above 60 years old. That 48 of the deaths should be those of children under 5 years old 17 is a lamentable circumstance. It is one that deserves a searching and continuous enquiry. The causes assigned for the deaths of a large proportion are defined in the mortality-returns. It is notorious that infants are more prone than those of more advanced ages, to epidemic diseases. But it is not true that this is so, as many people still believe, because children "must go through" these disorders. No child is left the better in constitution for having had Small-Pox, or Measles, or Scarlatina. On the contrary, these diseases frequently leave behind them the seeds of Scrofula, Consumption, and other diseases, which prove fatal at a later period. Nor is there any greater necessity or reason why a child should take the poison of Small-Pox or of Scarlatina, than for administering to it a dose of arsenic or prussic acid. The explanation of the greater frequency of zymotic diseases amongst infants, lies first, in the far greater activity of their circulating system, inducing a greater readiness to absorb poisonous matter contained in the air, or in food; and secondly, in the fact that they are more closely and more continuously exposed to the ordi nary sources of zymotic poisons, than are adults. I believe that the opinion is spreading amongst the Medical Officers of Health, whose duties have led them to investigate the causes of zymotic diseases more systematically, and with more completeness of sources of information, than had before been brought to bear upon this intricate question, that Measles, Scarlatina, and Typhoid Fever, may frequently be traced to one common cause, that cause being sewer-poison. It is not meant that these diseases are convertible into each other. But numerous observations show that all are apt to prevail simultaneously in the same localities, and that the localities especially obnoxious to them all, arc those in which the dwellings are exposed to the emanations from house-refuse, cesspools, obstructed drains, and last, not least, from the influx of air drawn direct from the sewers. The conviction of the truth of this proposition has been gradually gaining strength in my mind. I urge it here because it adds another argument to those already acknowledged in favor of active sanitary administration, and because it points forcibly to a special sanitary improvement to which I shall refer hereafter. It has often been said that children are the most delicate and sensitive tests of miasm. Where noxious gases and other injurious agencies exist, children suffer first and most; but they do not suffer alone. It would be a libel upon the purest feelings of human nature to seek to stimulate the apprehensions of a 18 community by suggesting that the safety and well-being of the parents depends upon the removal of those agencies which are hurtful to their children. I bring forward this reflection in order to show the relation between the zymotic diseases of children, the fever of adults, and the common sources of insalubrity. It is right that it should be understood that the preservation of our children is intimately associated with sanitary improvement. TABLE I.

Totals 961 693 503 723 995 2070 21 The Parish has been divided into Two Districts, called the East and West, and an Inspector of Nuisances has been appointed for each District. The Insfector of the West Division, Reports as follows: I beg to lay before you the following summary of proceedings taken for the removal of Nuisances, and the Sanitary improvement of the Parish, for the year ending March 25th, 18G1. These relate principally to the West Division of the Parish, the East Division having only been under my inspection for one quarter of the year. During the year I inspected 2115 houses, and from time to time reported to the Sanitary Committee on the state of such as required special notice; under my direction, 269 cesspools have been abolished, and 391 water closets erected in the place of open privies, with proper trapped soil pans, all drained to the sewers, and all the inlets to the drains properly trapped; 64 house drains have been cleansed and repaired, and an efficient drainage provided for 455 houses; dust bins have been provided for 56 houses; and additional windows for improving the ventilation have been put into 16 houses. Since the sewers constructed by the Vestry in the Vinegar Ground have been completed, 120 of the houses have been drained into them : dust bins have also been provided for many of the houses, with additional means of ventilation, and a great improvement has been effected in the sanitary condition of the locality ; most of these houses are the property of II. C. Sturt, Esq., who has shown a laudable anxiety, not only to improve the houses, but also to introduce a better class of tenants. Another group of houses, 20 in number, which recently came into Mr. Sturt's hands, on the expiration of a lease, situate in Mount rieasant, East Road, which were in a very bad state, and nearly always the seat of disease, have been completely renovated; the cesspools have been emptied and filled up, and water closets erected all properly drained; dust bins have been provided, and where necessary new windows have been put in to improve the ventilation. On the east side of number Street and near to Mount Pleasant, 24 houses have also been greatly improved in their sanitary condition, by the abolition of cesspools, and the erection of 22 proper water closets properly drained. Jane Shore Court, Shoreditch, a place that has been long complained of, has also been thoroughly drained; cesspools have been abolished, and proper water closets provided. The beneficial effects of these improvements are both immediate and permanent; the proper drainage of houses is absolutely necessary, for procuring one of the most essential requisites of health, pure air; and when cesspools arc emptied and filled up, there is no longer any fear of malaria arising from their putrescent accumulations, and at most of these houses the yards are so small, that the privies and cesspools were of necessity so near the doors and windows, that it was impossible to exclude noxious effluvia. All these improvements have been made at the expense of the owners; the Vestry providing and keeping in repair the necessary outfall sewers. When the question of expense for providing new sewers for unhealthy and badly drained localities is under consideration, it should never be forgotten that the pauperism of a place is to a large extent influenced by its sanitary condition; badly drained and ill-ventilated houses are fruitful sources of disease, which frequently produce pauperism it is therefore a wise economy, to prevent these as far as possible by improving the sanitary condition of those places that are defective, and this duty should not be considered accomplished until there is a sewer in every street, and a drain for every house. During the year I received complaints of Pigs being kept in 7 places where they were a nuisance and injurious to health, notices were given to the owners of the premises, requiring their immediate removal, which was done. I made three periodical inspections of the Licensed Slaughter-houses during the year, the last one made in March, included all that were in the parish, 90 in number, they were all in a satisfactory condition in respoct to drainage, paving, ventilation, and water supply; no complaints have been made respecting any of them. Daring the year, I received 765 applications to have Dust removed, which were all promptly attended to by the Contractor. The paved streets have been regularly and efficiently cleansed; but complaints have been made that the heaps swept up by the labourers in 23 the employment of the Vestry on the macadamized and ballasted roads, were not removed with the promptitude that was desirable, the new regulations adopted by the Vestry for the more efficient performance of this work will prevent all cause for complaint in future. Numerous complaints have been made of obstructions on the footways caused by tradesmen placing goods on the pavement, and having sun blinds too low, I served the parties complained of, with notices requiring them to observe the regulations of the Vestry, in respect to the occupation of the pavement and the height of sun blinds, this had the effect in most cases of keeping them within proper limits. In the course of the year, I summonsed two persons before the Magistrate, at the Police Court, Worship Street, to show cause for refusing or neglecting to comply with notices I had given them to empty and fill up cesspools which were causing nuisances, one in Napier Street, the other in Long Alley, in both cases the summons had the desired effect, without waiting for the Magistrate's decision, the parties caused the necessary work to be done, and the nuisance abated. The Inspector of the East Division Reports as follows: I find that up to the 25th December, 1860, I had given the respective parties notices to have the following works done: To remove the Dust (to the Contractor) 304 „ Mud &c. ditto 159 „ Obstructions of Sun Blinds 15 „ „ Goods 54 „ „ Stalls 11 „ Swine 5 Cleanse House Drains 231 Abolish Cesspools 48 Erect New Water-Closets 48 Repave Back Yards 4 Provide Back Windows 13 I had made an inspection of 431 houses, 139 of which were on account of ill health of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood 431 I had made 2 inspections of the 44 Slaughterhouses in the East District 2 24 THE FOLLOWING BILLS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE PARLIAMENT THIS SESSION AND HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE: * North London Hallway, (Branch to the City). Passed the Lords, with an additional clause, compelling the Company to run a cheap train once a day. North London Railway, (Widening). Thames Embankment. To enable a Company to embank the River Thames from Westminster Bridge to Black friars Bridge, (Middlesex side), and to form a Railway, a Main Sewer, and also a Road and approaches. Church Rates, (Bill to Abolish). Highways, (Not to interfere with the Metropolis). London Tramway and Dispatch Company. (This Bill docs not effect Shoreditch). Universal Private Telegraph Company. For the purpose of providing Telegraphic communications for Public Institutions, Railway, Police, and Fire Engine Stations, Read the second time in the House of Commons, on February 19th, 1861. Parochial Assessments Bill. This Bill introduced by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, proposes to appoint an Assessment Board from the Justices of the Peace, who are to have the entire control of the Assessments in the several parishes, without allowing the parishioners any power to appeal, (except on a point of law). The Committee considered this Bill arbitrary, unjust, very expensive, without the least benefit to the Ratepayers. A Petition against the Bill was presented to the House of Commons, February, 1861. 25 Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment. This Bill is brought before Parliament under the authority of the Metropolitan Board of Works; and the Committee (appointed by the Vestry) considered that some of the Clauses in the Bill were objectionable, especially those proposing to give power to the Metropolitan Board to levy contributions on the several parishes without the least reference to the benefit to be derived by the parties charged — and also to give such Board an excessive power over the Assessments and Valuations of the property in the Metropolis. A Petition against the Bill was presented to the House of Commons. Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment, (No. 2). This Bill proposes to settle the parishes upon which certain debts of the late Commissioners of Sewers shall stand charged. The Vestry did not oppose this Bill. Locomotives. For regulating the use of Locomotives on Turnpike Roads. Non-Conformists Burial Bill. County Rates and Expenditure. The Voluntary Commutation of Church Rates. County Franchise. A Bill proposing to extend the Franchise in Counties in England and Wales. This Bill would not interfere with the parish of Shoreditch. Borough Franchise. A Bill in which it is proposed to reduce the Qualification of a Voter from £10 to £6 yearly value. 26 The Bill for the better regulating the supply of Gas to the Metropolis, as passed last Session, authorizes the Vestry to provide apparatus for testing the illuminating power and purity of the Gas, and to appoint a competent person as Examiner. The Gas Companies are bound by the same Act, to erect within 1000 yards from their manufactory, experimental meters, and all other matters necessary for testing the illuminating power of the Gas supplied. In pursuance of these powers, the Vestry have appointed Dr. Barnes their Medical Officer, as Examiner, under such Act, and the Gas Companies have fixed the places to erect such works, and which places have been approved of by the Vestry,—that of the Independent Gas Company at No. 162, Kingsland Road, and that of the Chartered Gas Company, at No. 10, Coleman Street, London. The Vestry have held 50 meetings during the year for the dispatch of business. The Sewers Committee have met 17 times, and have received and considered 164 applications for drainage. The Lighting and Paving Committee have had 29 meetings, at which 212 applications have been received and disposed of. The Finance Committee have also met 30 times during the year. The Committee for the Survey and Valuation of Property in the Parish, have met 9 times. The Parliamentary Committee have had 12 meetings during the year. The Committee to whom it was referred to select an eligible site whereon to erect a Vestry Hall for the parish, have had 13 meetings, and have fixed on a plot of Freehold Ground in Haberdashers Walk, Hoxton, belonging to the Haberdashers Company, and now in the occupation of Mr. Stanbridge. The Land contains about 75 feet frontage, abutting on Haberdashers Walk, and about 148 feet in depth. The price agreed to be paid for the ground, which is Freehold, is £3000. The Vestry have adopted the Report of the Committee. An Assessor has been appointed who has made a Block Plan of the proposed Hall which is now under the consideration of the Committee. The matter is now waiting the sanction to the sale of the Freehold of the Charity Commissioners of England and Wales. 27 SITUATION OF THE SEVERAL PUMPS IN THE PARISH 1 Brunswick Street, Hackney Road 2 Queen's Road 3 Holt Place 4 Murray Street 5 Shaftesbury Street 6 Plumber Street, City Road 7 High Street, Shoreditch (Opposite 221, Shoreditch) 8 Ditto ditto ( „ 172, „ ) 9 Opposite Shoreditch Church 10 Curtain Road (Opposite Chapel Street ) 11 Worship Square 12 Hoxton Market Place (New) 13 Weymouth Terrace, New North Road (New ) 14 Great James Street, Hoxton (New ) 15 Margaret Street (East End ) 16 Brownlow Road (East End ) 17 Great Chart Street (North End ) The following are the places where Urinals are now in use Will Accommodate Persons Tabernacle Square (stone) 6 Swan Yard (slate & iron) 10 Iloxton Town (brick & slate) 4 Kingsland Road Bridge (slate) 3 Great Chart Street (iron) 2 Church Street, Iloxton (iron) 2 Hoxton Old Town, back of Workhouse (iron) 2 Cavendish Street, New North Road (iron) 2 Baring Street, New North Road (slate) 3 North End of Curtain Road (brick & slate) 4 28 A LIST OF THE VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS FOR THE YEAR 1861 The Rev THOMAS SIMPSON EVANS, M A , Vicar, 36, Hoxton Square MESSRS WILLIAM HUGHES, JOHN BAGLEY, Churchwardens JOHN WAKE, ESQ EDWARD SHEPHERD, Esq Representatives at the Metropolitan Board of Works No 1, or MOORFIELDS WARD Messrs ALLIBON, SAMUEL 83½, Paul—street BROWN, JOHN MARTIN 106, paul-street BLACK, ROBERT 29, Long-alley CRANSTON, WILLIAM 244, High-street, Shoreditch DEAK1N, HENRY 100, Curtain Road GREEN, GEORGE 1, Paul-street GOULD, JOHN 31, Holywell-row HAYNE, CHARLES 2, Paul-street HOSKING, RICHARD 91, Paul-street JACKSON, JOSEPH 25, High-street, Shoreditch MITCHELL, JOHN SMYTH 60, High-street, Shoreditch MUDIE, JOHN 1, Princes-street PITT, CHARLES 13, High-street, Shoreditch STEVENS, CHARLES 40, Holywell-lane SLANEY, JOHN Brett's-bvildings, Long-alley SYER, SAMUEL MARVEN 22, Holywell-lane WITTERING, JOHN 23, Paul-street WHITEHEAD, JOHN 192, High-street, Shoreditch Auditor,—Mr. RICHARD LEWIS, 57, Curtain-toad No 2, or CHURCH WARD Messrs ANDERSON, ALEXANDER 57, High-street, Hoxton BEWLEY, JOHN Tyssen Villa, Kingsland-road BARR, GEORGE 30, Curtain-road BERTIN, SAMUEL GEORGE 71, Paul-street 29 No. 2, or Church Ward—Continued.

W. G. DAVIS, Vestry Clerk Vestry Offices—37, Hoxton Square, June, 1861 ADDENDUM TO THE MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. . There is one circumstance bearing upon the statistics of infantmortality that requires to be adverted to. The births of still-born children are not registered. The burial charges for still-born children are considerably lower than those for children which have been born alive. As might be anticipated, there is therefore an interest, which begets a disposition, to return children that have manifested only feeble signs of life and dying within a few minutes of birth, as still-born. To this tendency on the part of parents and relations to transfer all cases of feeble or doubtful life to the category of dead-born, may be added the concurring effect of the practice of medical practitioners to regard as still-born all children which have not distinctly cried or at least breathed after birth. The question, however, " hat constitutes live-birth?" has recently been the subject of legal and medical discussion; and something of an authoritative definition has been established. A case has occurred in which, so far from there being any inducement to save a few shillings by ignoring equivocal evidences of life, the possession of considerable property depended upon whether a particular child had survived its birth, or not, if even only for a minute. In this case it was ruled that breathing was not necessary to prove live-birth; and that the pulsation of the heart was sufficient. It is probable that a very large proportion of the medical profession will assent to this doctrine. The consequenc e will be, that more deaths of new-born infants will be registered;, and that the importation of this new class of deaths into the tables will modify the mortality-statistics. 2 That the diminished mortality and the lesser frequency of epidemic diseases, are really due in great measure to sanitary works and inspection, is proved by the diminution and even disappearance of certain forms of sickness from streets, courts, and districts where sewers have been constructed, ventilation provided, and other improvements effected; whilst on the other hand, the districts still requiring these necessary reforms furnish far more than their proportion of the epidemic sickness and mortality. These important facts are demonstrated by registers 0n which are kept recorded the cases of epidemic disease and death occurring in every house. These are too voluminous to publish, but they are open for inspection. The arrest of the ratio of increase of the population, may be partially ascribed to the demolition of small tenements. And the same cause has certainly contributed to the diminution of sickness. Thus six houses in Mason's Court, eight in Gillum's Fields, five in Dean's Yard, besides many other isolated houses of unhealthy character have been rased. The construction of the projected Railway, will of course involve further alterations and demolitions. These I fear will not all be of a beneficial nature. That strictly local causes, and not the condition of the River, are most immediately influential upon health, is now proved by the healthhistory of several years. Whether the Thames has been offensive, or not, the health of London has gone on improving pari passu with local improvements. It is also important now to record, and hereafter to bear in mind, that before the operation of the Main-Drainage system, the health of the town has steadily improved. Had this system been brought into work, two years earlier, the credit of our improved salubrity would undoubtedly have been by many, triumphantly ascribed to its action. The experience brought by delay, has happily been the means of dispelling many injurious fallacies. We shall now be able to estimate at their proper value the advantages or the disadvantages of what was once proclaimed as the great and universal remedy—the Main-Drainage system. More and more impressed with the truth that sewage is the more noxious in proportion to its retention in a decomposing state near our dwellings, I again insist upon the importance of adopting means for 3 disinfecting, or rather for preventing the putrefaction of, the sewage, at the sources, not at the outlets, of our sewage.system. The mischief caused by decomposing sewage is done, in transitu, in its way under our feet through crowded habitations. To apply our disinfecting remedies when it reaches the Thames, where it is not proved to have done any harm, is absurd. If some contrivance could be adopted for discharging a minute quantity of McDougall's fluid into every water.closet simultaneously with each discharge of fæcal matter, the security against foul house drains, sewers, and noxious miasms from street.gulleys and ventilating shafts, would be almost perfect. I see no insuperable difficulty in accomplishing this; but in the meantime there is none whatever,— and it would involve very inconsiderable cost—in pouring regulated quantities of the disinfecting fluid into the head of every main drain or sewer. Until this be done, no house is safe against empoisonment by sewer.gases. These steal in, in spite of pipe.drains and the ordinary traps. At present, it remains, I am convinced from the clearest personal observation, absolutely necessary to cut.off the back.communication from the sewer to the house.drain, by the interposition of a special apparatus. I can speak positively of the efficacy of the ingenious contrivance of Mr. Lovegrove, the Surveyor for the Hackney District. Small.Pox and Vaccination.—During the year 1859, 87 persons died of Small.Pox in Shoreditch; and although during 1860 only 23 died from this cause, we are not justified in congratulating ourselves upon the diminished ravages of a disease, which it almost completely in our power to prevent, unless we can show that our preventive means have been employed to the fullest extent. I am afraid this cannot be shewn. The Vaccination Acts are still imperfect, and their provisions are imperfectly carried out. I place before you a Table shelving the relative progress of Vaccinations. Vaccinations Births Proportion. September 29th, 1854, to September 29th, 1855 2812 4542 = .62 „ 1855, „ „ 1856 3094 4748 = .64 „ „ 1856, „ „ 1857 3280 4869 == .69 „ „ 1857, ,, „ 1858 3022 4922 = .60 „ ,, 1858, ,, „ 1859 2502 4973 = .50 „ „ 1859, „ „ 1860 . 2659 5146 — .49 4 So far as this return may be trusted, it would appear that the Vaccinations bear year by year a smaller proportion to the births. We have no means of ascertaining to what extent private Vaccinations make up for the deficiency. But there can be no reasonable doubt that there is a large residum of un-vaccinated or unprotected persons, forming an ever-ready material for infection by Small-Pox. It appears to be a feature of this disease, to revisit a community at epochs, leaving it comparatively free during the intervening periods. If the recurring visitation happen to find the population largely unprotected, then will the scourge fall heavily; a considerable proportion of the unvaccinated which had been accumulating during the period of remission, will be carried off, and then, its natural fuel being consumed, the epidemic will again remit, to resume its destructive violence at a later period, when fresh material shall have gathered. To present what I believe is the nearest and most reliable view of the extent of what we may most properly call the "dangerous class,'—of that class, which negligent of its own safety, exposes the entire community to attack,—I refer to the result of an iuspection of two schools recorded in last year's report. I submitted 264 children to the double test of examination as to the evidence of actual protection, and of Vaccination. It was thus found that scarcely more than 6 children out of 10 were fully protected, that 2 more out of every 10 had been Vaccinated sufficiently to leave imperfect scars, and that 2 out of 10 shewed no mark of having been Vaccinated at all. Tested by Vaccination, it proved that fully 30 per cent were liable to take the Small-Pox. It has long been felt that more effective powers to extend Vaccination are needed. A Bill is now before Parliament, having for its object to throw upon certain official persons the duty (heretofore specially devolving upon no one) of proceeding before the Magistrate for the penalties enacted by law against those parents or guardians who shall neglect to have the children under their charge Vaccinated. The Vestry some time back sent a Petition to Parliament praying for more effective legislation on this subject. Sanitary Legislation.—Since last year, two important Acts have passed.: the Gas Act, and the Act for preventing the adulteration of articles of Food and Drink. Under the powers of the first Act, the Vestry 5 is authorised to check the illuminating power and chemical purity of the gas supplied. For this purpose the Medical Officer has been appointed Chemical Examiner under the Act. Until a special laboratory has been provided by the Vestry, the examination of the gas must be conducted on premises fitted up by the Gas Companies. This duty has not yet been commenced; but I trust that the necessary arrangements are on the point of completion. The execution of the Adulteration of Food Act, has been deferred for the present by the Vestry. The provisions of this Act do not appear to be sufficiently comprehensive to render it of much practical utility. As an instance of the difficulty of bringing it into useful operation, the experience of the City may be quoted. There although every means have been taken by giving full publicity to the measure, and by dispensing in certain cases with the payment of the fees authorised by the Act, the applications to the Analyst have been so few and unimportant as barely at present to justify the setting of the machinery required for the execution of the Act, into operation. It may however be hoped, that the experience now being gained, will lead to the enactment of more effective provisions. Coroners Inquests.—In the vast majority of instances, the cause of death is determined by the medical practitioner in attendance during the preceding sickness, and a certificate setting forth that cause, with other important particulars, is forwarded to the Registrar. In certain other cases, death taking place either without previous medical observation, or under other circumstances demanding inquiry, the cause of death is left to be determined by the Coroner's court. During last year 177 deaths were the objects of inquests. In 77 cases the decisive test of a post-mortem examination was resorted to in order to throw light upon the immediate cause of death. In most of the remaining cases, the cause of death was probably made sufficiently clear from other evidence. 107 inquests were held upon males, and only 70 upon females. The subjoined table of inquests explains to some extent this difference— males are more liable to violence and dangerous accidents. Thus whilst 28 males perished from "poison," drowning," or other forms of "violent death," only 10 females perished from like causes. 14 male children, and 7 female children under 1 year old were "suffocated in bed,". In an analysis made of the Coroner's inquests for 1858, attention was arrested by the circumstance, that whilst upon 21 female 6 infants, the verdict "found dead without marks of violence" was recorded, there were only 11 deaths of male infants so returned. That so many infants should perish in this manner, under circumstances likely to excite the most shocking suspicions against parents or guardians, is much to be lamented. That in numerous cases these deaths cannot he ascribed to criminality, seems proved by the fact, that deaths from suffocation in bed are far more frequent during cold weather. Children are covered up under the bed clothes, in such a manner that no air can reach them; they die of asphyxia, poisoned by breathing over again the fouled air from their own lungs. To this cause is no doubt superadded in some cases, the torper of cold. But these deaths ought to convey in the most emphatic manner, the lesson that even tender infants cannot live without a free supply of pure air, as well as warmth. These deaths prove most clearly the pernicious error of the too common practice of wrapping up children in such a manner as to exclude the external air. I earnestly trust that the publicity given to these Reports may be the means of rescuing many children from this frequent and frightful form of violent death. SUMMARY OF INQUESTS HELD IN 1860. MALES.
