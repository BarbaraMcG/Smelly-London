Twelfth Annual Report, presented pursuant to 198 sec. of the Metropolitan Local Management Act, 1855. The Board of Works for the Fulham District, in reporting to heir constituents, solicit attention to the following documents herewith presented. An Abstract of the several contracts entered into by the Board; an abstract of assets and liabilities, and an abstract of receipts and expenditure for the year ending 25th March, 1868. They also publish the excellent report of their Medical Officer of Health, in which the sanitary affairs of the district are fully dealt with. The Board has caused to be removed nuisance cases as follows:— Privies and cesspools 246 Drains and gullies cleansed and repaired 674 Houses do do do 281 Swine nuisances removed 299 Miscellaneous 78 Total £1,578 Houses benefited in Fulham 782 Houses „ Hammersmith 745 Total £1,527 The Board has during the past year negotiated a loan of £13,830 with the Imperial Life Assurance Company, for the purchase of the wharf, and for the completion of certain works of paving and sewering; an abstract of the mortgages therein are herewith presented. 6 TEWLFTH ANNUAL REPORT. The Board has constructed permanent works as follows in Fulham:— Lillie Road—curbing and paving. Waterford Road—curbing and paving. King's Road—curbing and making good the footpaths. Gas Factory Lane—ditto and making good the footpaths and roads. Harwood Terrace—ditto and making good the footpaths. North-end Road—ditto and making good the footpaths. High Bank—curbing and paving. South Parade, &c.—curbing and paving, Waterford Road, Munden Street, and Devonshire Street—a 12in. pip??? sewer. In Hammersmith:— West Kensington Gardens—curbing and paving. Angel Lane—curbing and paving. New Road—curbing and paving. Sewers—Bridge-street. do—Great George and South Street, do—Little George Street. do—Chapel Street. do —Shortlands, and the relaying of the Cornwall Road, and the Chancellors sewers. The Board has had under lengthened consideration the state o??? the roads of the district. Perhaps no roads in the entire metropolis have been subjected to so much injury as the roads in this neighbourhood All the leading thoroughfares having been but recently broken up for the construction of sewers, and the traffic of such roads diverted to other roads nearly incapable of bearing it, they would fain hope that the worst state of things has passed, and that by the extra metalling which these roads have received during the last two years, they are now in such condition that extra charges in respect of them will not again have to be incurred. The Board expect that by the expenditure of the balance of loan yet to be taken up in the construction of other sewers to complete the local system of drainage planned by their Surveyor nearly ten year since, and thus give facilities for the drainage of nearly all the property in the district requiring it.

TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, For the twelfth time I have the honour to lay before you my annual report, and with increasing satisfaction at our sanitary condition. Animated by a desire to carry out your administrative functions in this respect with as little oppression as possible, no great and sweeping changes have been made by you at any time in our social condition ; but it must be a source of great gratification to you to find that, though moderation in everything has prompted you in your actions, our District is gradually and most manifestly improving in all those great features of Hygeine now becoming essential in the public eye, and which, indeed, are truly so where such masses of people congregate together. Hammersmith took the initiative, and Fulham has closely followed in her wake in the demolition of those numerous and fearful sources of mischief, our open ditches, until we can now look through both these parishes and scarcely see a trace of them. Silently, but safely, the tide of sewage flows in grand culverts beneath our leading thoroughfares, and the great mass of houses abutting thereon have been drained into them. Still, with cormorant-like capacity, our once open fields cry for more of these hidden channels. The operations of the builder have annihilated acres of garden ground by the hundred, and even Fulham fields, that noted land of cabbages, is rapidly yielding, and will ere long gradually produce another crop. Here, however, I fear in several places the disadvantages will well nigh outweigh the benefits. The class of property likely in some of these cases to be erected will be little of an improvement over Wheatsheaf Alley and kindred places. Already we have reaped some fruits. John-street and Francis-street are types of what will follow them, and it will much astonish me if, with all our supervision, pauperism and sickness do not prevail. If the present Building Act be not sufficient to stay such work, I feel the time has indeed arrived when your Board should take some steps to ensure its amendment, and that without delay. The co-operation of other suburban Vestries 12 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. and Boards should be enlisted. The attention of the Sanitary Committee has lately been directed to the remnant of sewage left flowing into the Thames at Hammersmith. The houses between the intercepting sewer and the river still drain for the most part thereto; many difficulties attend the diversion of this sewage to its present legitimate channel, and it is a question whether, as has been suggested, some supplementary sewer must not be constructed along the northern shore of the Thames by the lower Mall. This subject is now anxiously engaging the attention of the Sanitary Committee of Hammersmith. Though the great bulk of the sewage has been diverted from the Creek, it still remains an objectionable mud pool, and I think its bottom should be concreted by the Metropolitan Board and be occasionally flushed. With the exception of the sewer from Waterloo-street, and one or two minor drains, the outlets of which are not yet removed from its banks, no drainage now goes into it. It is this spot to which I have so often referred as a most eligible one for baths and washhouses; and now the question of providing them for Hammersmith has been publicly mooted in our local journals, it may not be unfitting to refer to them in this report. At the Creek nature has done much to save the labour of forming most admirable swimming baths, ample room on either side is available for any necessary purpose, and the site may or ought to be procurable from the Metropolitan Board or Thames Conservancy at moderate cost; indeed, the upper part of the creek alone, now quite unused, would be nearly ample for the baths and buildings; but the frontage would be admirably adapted for another crying want of Hammersmith—a Town Hall. It may not be within the province of your Board to take the responsibility of these improvements, but your countenance and support would be of much importance in their accomplishment. No special features have marked the year 1867 in the Fulham District. The Registrar-General, however, in his annual summary, says:—''If the rising and falling rate of mortality be taken as the criterion of health, the year 1867 was the healthiest that London has enjoyed since 1860." The annual rate of mortality for London was 2.298, "when the metropolis as a whole is compared with the principal northern towns, its three millions have reason to be satisfied with the position it holds in the mortality tables." The western division, the Registrar-General says," was in the four years, 1863—6, the healthiest of all the five divisions, but last year its death rate was in excess, though only in the slightest degree of that which prevailed in the south districts. In the west the rate was 2.202; in the south 2.198." So in the Fulham District the number of deaths appears somewhat in excess, according to the usual mode of estimating increase of population, though I believe this REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. 13 mode of reckoning is very fallacious as regards our own parishes. The actual numbers of the population can only be ascertained at the next Census in 1871. The total mortality in Fulham and Hammersmith in 1867 has been 1222. An analysis of the causes of death shows satisfactorily that no increase has taken place in deaths arising from what are considered preventible diseases; on the contrary, the mortality from these during the past year has been by no means excessive. Neither fevers, measles, whooping cough, nor diarrhoea, have added any large number to our death rate, and though 1222 deaths have occurred amongst our population, the causes of death have not arisen from anything showing defect of sanitary condition. The improvement effected in the water supply to the poor has, I believe, produced a marked diminution in the prevalence of diarrhoea amongst them. Some qualification, however, in these remarks must yet be made. Infant mortality, in the great majority of cases, is not a destiny of nature. There can be no reason for supposing that nearly 50 per cent. of our deaths should arise in children at and under five years of age, or should be from what we popularly term a natural cause, Still, there is the fact before us. Year after year the same tale is told, and 1867 offers no exception. Five hundred and twelve of the deaths recorded have been of children who had not reached their fifth year. Of the diseases of the zymotic character, diarrhoea proved most fatal, though only sixty-seven deaths arose from this cause throughout the year. Fevers of various kinds cut off thirty-one lives, smallpox fourteen, measles eight, scarlatina twelve, diptheria seven, whoopingcough twenty-five, cholera four, carbuncle two. Phthisis destroyed one hundred and fifty-five persons. The number of deaths which have occurred in the workhouse during the year has been eighty-seven, in lunatic asylums nine, in Roman Catholic institutions twenty-eight, in alms houses fifteen, in the West London Hospital eighteen. Forty-four inquests have been returned. This catalogue of deaths I feel does not contrast unfavourably with a population of nearly or quite 50,000 people. Again, out of 1222 deaths 199 persons had attained the age of seventy years and upwards, seven of whom were nonogenarians. Independently of tubercular diseases, which cut off 228 lives, diseases of the organs of respiration come next in order, and from these 206 persons died. The deaths of eighty-one persons were also registered as arising solely from natural decay. Such, gentlemen, is our bill of fare for the year just past, and now in the middle of 1868 we still have favourable conditions prevailing. There is reason for much thankfulness in this; our poor especially are in healthfulness; work is by no means 14 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. scarce for them, and their homes, as far as practicable, in a better state than formerly. The mean temperature of the year 1867 has been 49.0. The mean reading of the barometer 29.944. Mean humidity 81 (Saturation 100). Mean amount of ozone .8. Mean cloud 8. The total amount of rain has been 23.99 inches, which has fallen on 178 days. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health.
