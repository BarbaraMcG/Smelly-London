THE CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1958, which includes the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. A duplicated form of the report has been adopted instead of the customary printed booklet. Although this is less attractive and convenient, it has eliminated the long delays which have been associated with printing and is, incidentally, less expensive to produce. Subject to the approval of the Council, I propose to continue to use the present form of report in the future. VITAL STATISTICS. The birth-rate and death rate were practically unchanged, remaining below the national averages in each case. Diseases of the heart and circulation and cancer were the main causes of death. There was a welcome fall in the number of deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus, and in the number of infant deaths. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. There was a sharp outbreak of dysentery (sonne type) at a County Primary School in Loughton during the early part of the summer. The suspected source of the infection was a meat pie served the day before the outbreak commenced, and this was confirmed by subsequent bacteriological examination of the remnants. The pie had been cooked on the day consumed, but contained meat which had been delivered to the school four days previously (on a Friday) and pre-cooked on the Monday-i.e., the day before the pie was baked and eaten. Ten children were absent with sickness and diarrhoea on the day following the meal and a further thirty-six on the next day. At this stage, specimens were obtained from the kitchen staff (twelve including part-timers), and routine disinfection of toilet seats, handles, knobs and taps at the school was commenced. Four of the above specimens proved positive to S. Sonnei, and the canteen was then closed. All local doctors were alerted, and advised concerning treatment, as the organism was found to be insensitive to the usual sulphonamide group. By courtesy of the manufacturers, supplies of Streptotriad tablets were made available at the Public Health Department and were issued to patients on request of a doctor. Absenteeism continued to be at a high rate during the next two or three weeks; a 11 the homes involved (276) were visited by a school nurse or public health inspector, and specimens (674) were obtained from the child and contacts, whenever gastro-intestinal symptoms were reported. Although the majority of cases occurred during the first -2- /three three days, and the outbreak was therefore explosive in nature, confirmed cases of sonne dysentery continued to occur sporadically in the District during the subsequent month or so. In all, 248 out of a total of approximately 600 children on the register of this school showed either clinical or bacteriological evidence (or both) of infection during this period and an additional 120 contacts (including 47 adults) were similarly affected. Many of them were not ill at all or had such mild and ill-defined symptoms, that it is not possible to say how many actual cases of dysentery occurred. Throughout this incident there was excellent collaboration between the officers of the Council, of the Education Authority and of the Public Health Laboratory services. The health visitors were most helpful with the investigations. The Council requested, and obtained, assurances from the Education Authority that appropriate instructions had been issued to ensure that there would be no repetition of the incorrect advice given by a member of the staff concerning the use of the meat in question, which was the cause of the outbreak. Apart from the above outbreak, the infectious disease situation was highly satisfactory. There were no cases of diphtheria, and only one of poliomyelitis. There were considerably less new tuberculosis notifications from the Debden L.C.C. estate (7) than in 1957 (l8). The intensive public Mass Radiography campaign which took place in 1957, almost certainly revealed cases which would otherwise not have come to light until 1958 or later. Further, suggestions for intensifying the future campaign against tuberculosis have been submitted to the County Medical Officer and accepted for publication by the British Medical Journal as the result of knowledge and experience I gained whilst in Denmark. I want to take this opportunity of again expressing ray appreciation to the Council for allowing me to accept the scholarship awarded to me by the Government of that country. NEW LEGISLATION. The Clean Air Act (1956) came into operation on 1st June, 1958, and in anticipation thereof, the Council has had the question of establishing a smoke control area under continuous review since April, 1957. On my report and recommendation, the Council's River Estate-a compact area comprising 720 dwellings, with no slums or industries-was selected for first consideration, as it was thought that this could be converted into a smokeless zone with the minimum of delay and expense, and that the project would provide useful experience to the department when considering conversion of the whole District at a later date. The Council has so far deferred action pending further information on action proposed to be taken by neighbouring Authorities in more heavily polluted areas to the windward side of the District, and further clarification of the smokeless fuel supply position. The anomalous position of landlords and tenants on opposite sides of the boundary of any smokeless zone. -3- /is is bound to create problems, and it would have been better if the Act had been obligatory to cover all built-up areas by the end of a specified period of, say, ten years. I am dismayed that the rapidly increasing contribution of motor vehicles to atmospheric pollution is receiving so little serious attention. Under the amended Regulation 79 of the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations, 1955, it is an offence to" use or cause or permit to be used on a road any motor vehicle from which any visible vapour, grit, sparks, ashes, cinders or oily substance is emitted, if the emission therefrom causes, or is likely to cause, any damage to any property or injury to any person, who is actually at the time or who reasonably may be expected on the road, or is likely to cause danger to any person as aforesaid." One sees this offence being committed daily from numerous vehicles, and almost universally from diesal engines; yet we are told that it can all be avoided by adequate construction and maintenance. I have yet to hear of any police action taken under this Regulation, or even so much as a verbal warning. Even in the absence of evidence by witnesses it should not be too difficult to produce evidence of the offence from a simple road test or sampling of exhaust fumes. In assessing the importance of this form of atmospheric pollution, it must net be forgotten that it arises near the ground and has little chance to be diffused and diluted by fresh air, as happens with smoke discharged from a chimney. The Slaughterhouses Act. 1958 deals with the general licensing of slaughterhouses and enables the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood to make regulations by statutory instrument. There are four licensed slaughterhouses and one knacker's yard in the District and these will have to conform to the new standards. SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 and NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (Amendment) ACT, 1951. 11 cases have been under observation during the year, 3 of these were admitted to hospital; 2 remained in hospital from last year; the 6 remaining cases have been kept under observation at home with a view to further action, if necessary. "GUARD THAT FIRE" CAMPAIGN. This campaign was run by the Essex County Council in conjunction with District Councils during the month of November. Assistance was given in the distribution of propaganda on behalf of this Council, by the British Red Cross Society, Women's Voluntary Service, Women's Institutes, Townswomen's Guild and Public Health Inspectors of my Department. Propaganda was in the form of leaflets and posters issued by 4 /the the Ministry of Health and ROSPA, and distributed as follows:- Police Station Public Houses Coal Merchants Ironmongers Electrical Shops London Electricity Board North Thames Gas Board Children's Wear Shops Factory Canteens Council's Notice Boards and Vehicles. Doctors' Surgeries Leaflets supplied by the Essex County Council were distributed with this Council's rating notes. A filmstrip was shown at the local cinema. Photographs and specimens of flameproof materials were included in a small display at the Council Offices. SANITARY CONDITIONS. In the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector it will be seen that the work of the Department continues to increase. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

(i) Water The water supply of the District is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board except for one house in the District where it is drawn from a well. This house is in the ownership of the Conservators of Epping Forest and is situated in the forest a long way from the mains supply. The water is piped and has been generally satisfactory both in quality and quantity. The number of houses is 16,950 and the estimated population at midyear was 61,150. Two samples of water were taken during the year and reports were received from the Counties Public Health Laboratories as follows 1. Pond Water. Bulls Head Pond, Lou£hton. 'This sample has a substantial though not excessive amount of organic matter for a pond water, bacterial quality is of a comparatively high standard and the analysis presents no evidence of the entry of polluting discharges. The results therefore suggest that the bad smell is caused simply by the death and decay of weed growth." 2. Drinking Water. 1ll Forest Road, Loughton. "This sample is practically clear and bright in appearance, has a reaction on the alkaline side of neutrality and is free from metals. The water is very hard in character but its hardness and its content of mineral and saline constituents in solution are not excessive. It is of a high standard of organic quality. Slight bacterial impurity is present. These results are consistent with a wholesome water suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. However, the bacteriological quality fails to reach a high standard and the results thus indicate the advisability of effective protection of the storage tank against possibly more serious contamination." A notice to properly cover the water storage tank was sent to the owner. As the result of several complaints of an unpleasant taste of the /water water after the whitsun holiday, the following is an extract from a letter sent by The Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board in explanation:- "As you know the water 3upply is derived from the River Lee, stored in the Board's reservoirs at Walthamstow and filtered and chlorinated at the Lee Bridge Works. We have suffered from heavy growths of algae in the reservoirs during the past weeks and chlorination becomes difficult at these times. Complaints of taste in the distribution system became numerous immediately after the Whitsuntide weekend although no taste was detectable in the water leaving the works nor in samples examined here after collection from complainants' premises. Thus the taste and odour appeared extremely evanescent and when I sent out a taster on to the district it was only occasionally that he was able to detect a taste and this disappeared very quickly. There is no difference in the chemical content of the water and it is difficult to explain the actual cause of the trouble. Remedial measures were immediately taken on the works to ensure that no residual chlorine passed into supply and since then the number of complaints has fallen rapidly. I can assure you that at all times the water has been maintained at a satisfactory level of hygienic quality and the closest vigilance has been kept up on the chlorination treatment and taste detection." (ii) Drainage and Sewerage Soil drainage from the greater part of the District is by gravity to the main disposal works at Luxborough which were modernised in 1938, considerably enlarged shortly after the war, and are to be further extended by a scheme submitted to the Ministry. Tenders for part of this scheme, the construction of four additional primary digesters, should be received early in 1959. Consideration is being given to extra treatment of final effluent to maintain a higher standard of purity as part of the scheme, if land can be acquired for the purpose. In the meantime, the Works have operated reasonably well and discharged a fair effluent. -13- /There There is one small subsidiary works at Millers Lane, modernised after the war, which maintains a good effluent. One small area drains to the sowers of Wanstead and Woodford, thence to Chingford and the East Middlesex scheme. Most of the Hainault Estate drains to the sewers of the Dagenham district and the Works of that Authority. There are four out-lying pumping stations lifting flow from low lying areas up to main gravity sewers. One of these stations has been replaced by a new one during the year and another one is intended to be similarly replaced in connection with a main outfall sewer scheme now being prepared. There is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. 2. Rivers and Streams. The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex Rivers Board. There has been some flooding of fields in the valley during the abnormal weather of 1958 but otherwise it has been very limited for a number of years and is often non-existent. 3. (i) Closet accommodation and Cesspools. Number of Cesspools and Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 78 Loughton 12 Number of Earth ??? Chemical Closets in Houses: Chigwell 35 Loughton 6 Number of Chemical Closets in Caravans: Buckhurst Hill 3 Chigwell 12 Loughton 1 /Premises -14- Premises which have earth closets, chemical closets, cesspools and septic tanks are in areas where no sewer is available. One house previously drained by a cesspool has been connected to the Council's sewer during the year. Every opportunity is taken to connect premises to main drainage and schemes are in hand with this in view. (ii) Public Cleansing Domestic refuse has been collected once weekly throughout the district by the Council vehicles and labour. A fleet of seven 10/l2 cu.yd. "Fordson/Eagle" covered lorries, each drawing a covered trailer for salvage, is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for individual special collections. Trade refuse has also been collected, a charge related to actual cost being made for this service. Refuse is disposed of by controlled tipping at a tip provided by a contractor. Payment to the firm is per load and includes levelling, compacting and covering, a bulldozer and the covering material being provided in the price. The area exposed at any one time is kept to a low minimum and measures are taken against flies and vermin as necessary from time to time. Salvage of paper and rags produced sales during the year of 500 ???tons. Since the schools have made arrangements to dispose of canteen waste to private contractors, the Council have discontinued the separate collection of kitchen waste. Road gullies (in adopted District roads) have been emptied and re-sealed with clean water by machine three times during the year by contract. (iii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area An outline of the work of the Public Health Inspectors is shown below:- Complaints received and dealt with 738 Inspections and visits 7,222 Nuisances abated 360 Informal Notices served 59 Informal Notices complied with 50 Statutory Notices served 13 Statutory Notices complied with 11 Legal Proceedings 5 /Summary -15- Summary of Nuisances Cesspools, overflowing 3 Drains blocked or defective 139 Defective water closets 14 Defective Water Supply pipes 1 Nuisances from animals and birds 5 Polluted ???,watercourses and ponds 2 Accumulation of refuse and defective dustbins 6 Vermin (bugs and fleas) 7 Cellars flooded 2 Insect infestations 120 Bees, wasps and hornets 43 Air pollution 18 (iv) Verminous Premises Seven houses were reported on as verminous during the year, of which, when inspected, two were not confirmed. The other five were infested with bugs (l) and fleas (4). All the houses were fumigated successfully with Fumite. Four of the premises were Council houses and one an old persons' home. Number of visits-25 /Rodent Control -16- RODENT CONTROL PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. 1,497 inspections and visits were made in 1958, as against 2,010 in 1957. Yearly figures since the passing of the Act were:- 1956 1,080 1952 2,011 1955 1,548 1951 1,924 1954 1,308 1950 2,020 1953 1,388 1949 1,833 It will therefore be seen that the 1956 figure of 1,080 was the lowest, and there has undoubtedly been an increase in the notifications received from the general public. Warfarin is now almost solely used and the results obtained are excellent. Treatment of the Council's soil and surface water sewers was done as usual with the following results:- March, 1958 October, 1958 Manholes baited 221 210 Poison part-takes 21 8 Poison complete takes 13 Nil Specially blended oily Warfarin was used for both treatments. It would appear from the October, 1958 figures, that the rat population of the sewers is decreasing. -17- SECTION D HOUSING STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1958 Number of new houses erected, rated and occupied during the year:- Permanent Houses London County Council 7 Chigwell Urban District Council 66 Private Owners 282 355 Inspection of Dwelling Houses during the year:- 1 (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health and Housing Acts) 586 (b) Number of visits made for the purpose 643 2.

The Garde IV sample resulted in legal action and this is reported previously under "Food Complaints". The Grade III sample would also have had legal action taken but for difficulty in establishing the correct particulars of the person or persons responsible for the sale of the Ice Cream. In other cases where the samples were below the "satisfactory" grading, the matter has been taken up with the manufacturers and the local authorities in whose districts the Ice Cream was made. The results of samples of Ice Cream manufactured in the district are very good indeed.
