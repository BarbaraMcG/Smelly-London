The Old Burial Ground in High Street, Lambeth (which was converted into a Recreation Ground, and transferred by the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers to the charge of the Vestry in May, 1884), and the Open Space at Stangate, opposite St. Thomas's Hospital, have been maintained by the Vestry at an outlay during the year of £268 9s. 9d., while the Vestry has contributed the sum of £38 4s., being half the cost of maintaining the Grounds of St. John's Church, Waterloo Road. ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN. After the Annual Election in May, 1887, it was discovered that two of the Members returned for the Stockwell Ward did not possess the sufficient rateable qualification of £ 40. and that an extra vacancy existed which had not been filled up. In consequence of this, under the advice of Mr. Finlay, Q.C., an application was made to the High Court, by the Clerk, in the names of some Ratepayers of the Parish, for an Order for a Mandamus for a new Election to supply the three vacancies. The application was successful, and the necessary Order was made by the Court. A new Election took place, and the three vacancies were filled up. This was the first case of the kind since the passing of the Metropolis Management Act, 23 PUBLIC LIBRARIES. The Public Library Act (limited to a rate of ½d. in the £ per year) was adopted by the Parish in the month of December, 1886. The opinion of the Ratepayers was taken by means of Voting Papers, in accordance with the Amendment Act, the voting- being as follows:— For the adoption of the Act 15,292 Against 12,48. Majority 2811 The following gentlemen were, on the 3rd February, 1887, elected by the Vestry as the first Commissioners to carry out the powers of the Act The Hon. and Rev. Canon Pelham, Rector of Lambeth. Mark H. Beaufoy, Esq., J.P. W. S. Caine, Esq., M.P. R. Gent-Davis, Esq., M.P. George Howlett, Esq. Edwin Lawrence, Esq. Horace Brooks Marshall, Esq., J.P. Evan Spicer, Esq. William Stiff, Esq. Messrs. Beaufoy, Howlett, and Marshall retired by ballot in February, 1888, and were re-elected. A large Meeting in support of the Libraries was held at the Lambeth Palace Library on the 7th May, 1887, with His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury in the chair. At such Meeting large subscriptions were announced to help the movement, the object being to purchase Sites and erect Libraries from donations to be obtained from the public, so that the entire amount to be realised from the rate might be devoted to the payment of the yearly maintenance and working of the Libraries, without deduction for rent or interest on or repayment of loans. 24 Amongst the donations promised at the Lambeth Palace Meeting was one from Frederick Nettlefold, Esq., of £1000 towards the establishment of a Library at Norwood. A piece of Freehold Land was purchased at Norwood, in Knight's Hill Road, opposite St. Luke's Church, and the purchase-money (£1050) was paid by Mr. Nettlefold. Plans for the building were at once prepared by Mr. Sidney Smith, an architect living in Lambeth; a contract for the erection of the building entered into with Messrs. Higgs; and, after considerable progress had been made in the foundations and ground floor of the building, the first stone was formally laid by Mr. Nettlefold on the 26th of November, 1887. At the end of the Vestry's year the building is practically completed. The cost of the building will be, it is expected, a little over £4000, which will be defrayed partly out of the Rate and partly through Donations promised at the Lambeth Palace Meeting. A Library had for some time been opened in South Lambeth, in a private house in the South Lambeth Road, the books having been contributed by Mr. Caine, M.P., and Mr. Henry Jephson. These books were generously handed over by them to the Commissioners, and the Library was taken over by the Commissioners in the summer of 1887, Mr. Jephson agreeing to pay the rent of the house to Christmas, 1887. Henry Tate, Esq., of Streatham, paid £1150 for the purchase of a Freehold Site in the South Lambeth Road for a permanent Library, and he has also agreed to provide the entire cost of the erection of a handsome building suitable for a Library. The contract for the building and fittings will, it is expected, amount to about £4800, bringing up Mr. Tate's gift to £6000. A third Library has been provided, through the generosity of Miss Durning Smith (a sister-in-law of Mr. Edwin Lawrence, one of the Commissioners). She originally offered to give £5000, and a Freehold Site was purchased at Kennington Cross for about £2200. The contract for the building amounted to £7000, and Miss Durning Smith, to cover this expense, has increased her donation to £10,000, so that the entire Site and Building will be paid for by Miss Durning Smith. The building has been commenced but will not be completed until 1889. A sum of £10,000 has been promised by John Noble, Esq., of Henley-on-Thames, towards the purchase of the ground and the erection of a Library for North Lambeth, which will make four Libraries in all. The following is an Account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Commissioners from their election, in February, 1887, to 25th March, 1888.

During the parochial year, i.e., from the 5th day of April, 1887, to the 5th day of April, 1888, the Overseers have made out and delivered to the Assessment Committee four Provisional Lists, Nos. respectively 9, 10, 11, and 12, and the yearly Supplemental List. The value of property in the Parish assessed for the relief of the Poor has been as follows :— £ ] On the 8th April, 1870, prior to the first,Valuation List being made out 1,0044,810 848,230 As settled by the Committee by the first Valuation List in 1870 1,121,475 919,015 As settled by the Committee by the Quinquennial Valuation List in 1873 1,263,046 1,034,710 As settled by the Committee by the second Quinquennial Valuation List, 1880, after the Appeals to the Assessment Sessions 1,574,513 1,284,862½ As settled by the Quinquennial List, 1885, after the Appeals to the Assessment Sessions 1,801,014 1,461,540 As settled by the Supplemental List, 1886 1,828,704 1,491,123 As settled by the Supplemental List, 1887 1,838,193 1,491,123 PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. 1. Prior to the Parliamentary Session of 1888 notices were given by the London Tramway Company of two extensions of their tramway lines, viz. (1.) The continuation across Westminster Bridge of the Company's present line in Westminster bridge Road to the Westminster side, and (2.) To continue the present line along Brixton Hill from Water Lane to the corner of Telford Avenue. Both these proposed lines were assented to 28 by the Vestry, subject to certain conditions, but ow^ng to objections raised elsewhere, both bills were withdrawn. 2. The South-Eastern Railway Company applied to Parliament for power to purchase some W harf Property, and also some House Property, in connection with the widening of their line leading from Waterloo Bridge Road to Charing Cross. The Vestry considered that a clause should be inserted in the Bill, providing that the Company should recoil]) the Parish for the Rates of any property taken by the Company until such property was again brought into rating by works being erected thereon, and accordingly instructed the Clerk to present a Petition against the Bill. The Company objected to the locus standi of the Vestry to oppose the Bill. The matter was heard by the Standing Order Committee, who refused to allow the Vestry to be heard against the Bill, on the ground that the value of the property proposed to be taken was not sufficient to give the Vestry the right to oppose the Bill. 3. The United Telephone Company introduced a Bill into Parliament, asking for further powers to place wires over, along, across, and under the Roads of the Metropolis, not being of a less height than 15 feet from the surface of the road, without the consent of the Road Authority : and to place and maintain posts upon roads, and wires under roads, under certain restrictions, with power to a joint Committee appointed by the Road Authorities of the City and the Metropolitan Board of Works to make Bye-laws. A Bill of a somewhat similar character was introduced into Parliament in the year 1885, but was not proceeded with. At that time, a Conference of Delegates from the various Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards was held on the 16th April, 1885, at the Lambeth Vestry Hall. This Conference was held on the invitation of the Vestry, and resolutions were passed in 29 opposition to overhead wires being allowed. A further Conference of Delegates from the various Vestries and District Boards was held at the Lambeth Vestry Hall on the new Bill, and resolutions were passed in opposition to the powers asked for, and advising Petitions to be lodged against the Bill. Petitions were in consequence very generally presented to Parliament against the Bill by the London Vestries and District Boards, and in the result the Bill was not proceeded with. 4. A Company, called the South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, applied for a Provisional Order under the "Electric Lighting Act, 1882," for a district comprising a part of Lambeth, and a still larger portion of London to the North of the River. The part of Lambeth included Waterloo Bridge Station, and extended from Waterloo Bridge Road, along the Lower Marsh to Westminster Bridge Road, and thence to Westminster Bridge. The Vestry decided to oppose the order, and directed the Clerk to send to the Board of Trade a letter containing objections in accordance with the Act. This was done, and the Chief Official of the Board of Trade held a Sitting to consider the objections of the Vestry, and the other Public Bodies opposing, to the Order. The Board of Trade then decided to postpone for a lime the further consideration of the Draft Order, and eventually the Parish of Lambeth was withdrawn from the Draft. 5. The Vestry decided to apply to Parliament for power to make its own rates, and to take over some of the other powers and duties of the Overseers. Notices were accordingly given, and a Petition for a Bill was lodged by the Clerk. An Action was then instituted by the Attorney-General (at the relation of Mr. Charles William Smith, a Member of the Vestry) Mr. Smith, and the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Parish against the Vestry. 30 By the Action the Plaintiffs claimed an Injunction to restrain the Vestry, its servants and agents from paying or applying any portion of the rates of the Parish, or of the funds of the Parish, in or defraying the expenses incurred, or to be incurred, in the promotion of the Bill in Parliament, or any Bill of a like nature, or from allowing the name of the Vestry to be used for the promotion of the said Bill or of any Bill of a like nature. The case was heard on motion by Mr. Justice North, and was argued by Sir Horace Davcy, Q.C., for the Plaintiffs, and by Mr. Rigby, Q.C., for the Vestry. The Judge granted an injunction restraining, until the hearing of the Action, any expenditure of the rates of the Parish in promoting the Bill, but refused to restrain the use of the name of the Vestry in the application to Parliament. It was afterwards decided by the Vestry to abandon the Bill, and an arrangement was made by the Vestry with the Plaintiffs in the Action, that the injunction should be made perpetual, and that each party should bear their own costs, but that no further proceedings should take place in the Action. 6. Two applications were made to Parliament for powers to construct Public Parks in the Parish. The Bills were, the Vauxhall Park Bill and the Raleigh Park Bill. At the end of the parochial year both Bills were still under the consideration of the House of Commons. The proposed Park at Vauxhall consisted of the site of the Lawn and Carroun House at the corner of South Lambeth and Fentiman Roads, and contained about eight acres. The other proposed Park faced Brixton Hill, and consisted of the site and grounds of an old house known as Raleigh House, and contained about twelve acres. The Vestry passed resolutions authorising contributions towards the pur chase of both properties—viz., for Vauxhall Park £1500 per acre, and for Raleigh Park £1000 per acre. 31 OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE STREETS. Of late years a great increase has taken place in the number of costers and others selling goods on the pavement and roadways of the streets in the Parish. In many eases trucks or stands were placed in the roadway for hours at a time, and sales took place from such trucks and stands. Special attention has been directed by the Vestry to this matter, so as to stop its commencement in new streets or in main thoroughfares, and in districts where the practice had not previously existed. In cases of continued persistence, proceedings have been issued against the offenders before the Police Magistrates. VESTRY IMPROVEMENTS. As there is a probability of some change being made in the management of affairs which have been, during the last 32 years, under the control and direction of the Vestry, the occasion of making the Annual Report suggests a suitable opportunity of taking a retrospective glance at what has been done during that period in the matters connected with the sewerage and drainage of the Parish, and the maintenance, repair, and cleansing of the highways and streets and places, and other works, coming within the duties of the Sewers Committee, and the Committee for General Purposes. A comparison of the present time with that of 1856, shows the rateable value then was £490,255, against April, 1888, £1,491,123; the produce of a penny rate was then £2,042 14s. 7d., it is now about £5555. 32 GENERAL PURPOSES. With reference to the management and keeping of the streets and ways in the parish much improvement has been made. Thirty-two years is a long time to earn', but those who can call that time to mind will remember that the streets when cleaned were not cleared, but the stuff was allowed to remain sometimes in the road and then in heaps at the side of the footpath till some convenient opportunity occurred for it to be taken away. The paved footways were few and confined to the inner parts of the Parish; in the greater portion the footways were gravelled. Along the turnpike roads the footways were not considered a liability of the Trustees nor acknowledged by the Parish, so that they were worse cared for than any. The demand for improvement in footway paving was one of the most pressing duties the Vestry had to provide for, and they commenced upon the principle of dealing first with main arterial lines, Clapham Road, Brixton Road, Wandsworth Road, South Lambeth Road, Camberwell New Road, Cold Harbour Lane, &c., where flagging was necessary, then followed on with the further portions of the Parish where the traffic is sufficiently provided for by the substitution of tar paving for gravel. The work was steadily and systematically pursued, so that in the course of a few years the whole of the Parish was put in a fair and equal condition. This was effected by loans, which enabled the work to be done quickly, so as to prevent the feeling that one part was neglected while another was favoured, and the loan being spread over several years, was discharged by a moderate charge in the annual rate. 33 In 1874 the Vestry determined to discontinue the system of contracting for paving works, and undertook the purchase of materials and employment of masons and paviours for the execution of these works. By the change, better and more uniform quality of materials and workmanship has been obtained, and a saving effected in cost. A large economy arises by the adaptation of the old York flagging, which when taken up from a main thoroughfare is at small cost rendered fit to relay in some less important situation, and so save the cost of new stone. Tar paving work is also done by men employed by the Vestry with very satisfactory results, both as to quality, endurance and price. When the Vestry came into operation there were a great number of what were called undedicated roads in the Parish; there was no difference between those which were dedicated and those which were not, except that those interested either knew better how to get the dedication effected or were more favoured in their endeavours. The provisions of the Metropolis Management Act set right much that was wrong in that matter. The Vestry did fair justice by placing streets in which the circumstances of comparison were similar, upon equal terms, and starting the new operations without creating invidious differences of treatment by starting a new line for the future, to be uniformly applied, so that all future builders knew the liability they would be under. Since 1861, as soon as the buildings in new streets have been advanced so as to form a street under the Act, upon application from the residents, the Vestry have taken proceedings to bring such streets under charge, the first cost or making up roads and paving footways being recovered From the owners. There has been a large amount of this work done, 401 streets, with 47¾ miles of road and 95¼ miles of footway paving, having been taken to. In the year 1865 the Turnpike Trusts in the Parish were abolished, and 5½ miles of main lines of roadway came into chargc c 34 of the Vestry. For some years the watering of the Parish was done by water pumped by men from wells in the roads where water could be obtained, then only certain streets were watered during a portion of the year. The Vestry in course of time made the watering a general service throughout the Parish, to be done when required, without regard to season. Arrangements were made with the Water Companies to supply the ncccssary water for that purpose at a price per mile. Subsequently arrangements were brought about by which the water is supplied by meter at per thousand gallons, so that the actual consumption is paid for according to the requirement. In 1876 the Vestry determined to adopt the principle of doing their own work with respect to Slopping and Dusting, and Wharf Premises in Belvedere Road were taken and fitted up for that purpose. The new system was commenced in November of that year, with 16 horses, soon increased to 20. After the working of the system had been fully tested, and a satisfactory result insured, additional stabling was erected, and the Vestry have now 50 horses and proportionate plant engaged upon the Street Cleansing and Removal of House Dust in the Marsh and Wall Wards, Bishop's, Prince's, and part of Nos. 1 and 2 Out Wards. The annual statement gives the weekly particulars of work done, and a comparative Summary of each year from the commencement. The advantages arising from the Vestry doing the work are that it is better done, the requirements are met as they arise, and not ncglccted in consideration of other claims, as must be the case with a Contractor. While being done more regularly it is also done more quickly, by the Vestry having a near shoot always ready. The work is also done with consideration for the circumstances of different localities; and with all the improvements, of which there can be no question, the cost is not greater, 35 Wood paving has been laid in several main roads and found to he a great boon for quiet and cleanliness, in York Road, Stamford Strert, Upper and Lower Kcnnington Lane, Waterloo Road, and Lambeth Palacc Road. The cost of these works being spread over a period of years, enables the benefit to be obtained for about the same cost as was incurred by the maintenance of the Macadam roads. Arrangements were made for considerable extension of wood paving, but the provisions of the new County Council Act have led the Vestry to defer that work until the future course with regard to the maintenance of the main roads of the Metropolis is determined.

With reference to the drainage of Lambeth, at the appointment of the Vestry, the system of Sewerage in existence did not extend beyond Kennington Church; all the Parish beyond that point was dependent upon two lines of open watercourses, the Effra and the Heathwall; the Effra brought the drainage from the upper part of Norwood and discharged at VauxhaU, the Heathwall ran along the low ground at the back of Wandsworth Road, and brought the drainage from Acre Lane and Stockwell and Wandsworth Road, discharging at Nine Elms. Upon appointment, the Vestry lost no time in carrying out such works as the existing outlet sewers permitted. A sewer was made along the Clapham Road to the Parish boundary, which provided for the drainage of streets right and left from Brixton Road to South Lambeth Road. In anticipation of the New Main Drainage system to be made by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and while waiting for improved outlets for some parts, the Vestry at once set about constructing Sewers in all the places where then existing works afforded an opportunity, and as soon as the new Main Drainage provided the means for constructing Sewers, where no outlets previously existed, the Vestry made the necessary preparations, so that no delay occurred in affording the full benefit to the various parts of the Parish so soon as the new Main Drainage became available. These works were pursued for several years, and the money required was provided by loans spread over a period of years, so that while the benefit was secured at the earliest practicable time, those who now enjoy the benefit have to bear a share of the cost by which it was obtained. After the main lines of Sewers had been constructed the subsidiary lines were considered and dealt with, and land which had not been eligible for building came rapidly into 39 request, so that the Vestry soon found themselves called upon to do at the moment what had been regarded as a possible obligation several years later. It may now be said that for some years the arterial drainage of the Parish has been completed, and the greater part of what remains to be done is work which will devolve upon the owners of land to provide, as their property becomes converted into buildings.

During the year ending 25th March, 1888, there have been erected 58 ordinary Column Lamps and 6 Bracket Lamps, 4 Column Lamps have been discontinued, and 32 Column Lamps and 3 Bracket Lamps shifted to positions of greater utility, whilst in two cases Brackets have been replaced by Columns. Four powerful 3-burner Lamps have been erected in the following localities:—Lambeth Road, at either side of the Railway Arch (2); York Road, corner of Westminster Bridge Road (1); and Brixton Road, corner of Ferndale Road (1). The following arc particulars of 4061 Lamps lighted and maintained at the expense of the Vestry: — Gas Company's District Single Burner, 5ft. per hour 5-Burner, 50 ft. per hour 3- Burner, 33 ft. per hour 3-Burner, 25 ft. per hour 2-Burner, 20 ft. per hour 2-Burner, 10 ft. per hour Single Burner, 10 ft. per hour Totals.

The South Metropolitan Gas Company, from Lady-day, 1887, reduced the annual charge for public lamps from £3 9s. to £5 7s. 4d., subject to the 42 usual discount of 5 per cent.; the Gas Light and Coke Company reduced the price of gas per 1000 cubic feet on 31st March, 1887, from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 5d., and again on 1st January, 1888, from 2s. 5d. to 2s. 2d. These reductions effect an annual saving to the Parish, on the present number of lamps, of about £520. The Gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company and by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company has been regularly tested by the Medical Officer, and the following is a summary of the Lighting Committee's Reports to the Vestry:— Gas Companies.

Thirty-second Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Re fort for t e year ending December 31 st, 1887, on the ViteU and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. The population of the Parish of Lambeth is estimated at 278, 014 person n and upon this computation the statistics contained in the tables appended to this report are calculated. In order, as far as possible, to exclude any element of inaccuracy from the death statistics, the record of the death of parishioners who die in extra-parochial Institutions, and that of those who, although they be not parishioners, yet die in the public Institutions of Lambeth, is noted, the one to be added to, and the other deducted from, the returns proper to the district. A 2 A record not only of death but of disease, so far as it can be obtained without compulsory notification has been considered one of the primary objects of the Annual Report. It has been my endeavour so to arrange and tabulate information relating to this matter, that it may be in a form the most accessible to reference. The maps, a new feature in these reports, will it is believed materially assist in this purpose.* The maps are a facsimile in miniature of those of the regulation size. To each of the more important of the zymotic diseases a map is assigned. These have a place in the office of the department. Clean at the commencement of the year, upon the occurrence of disease the position of the house affected is indicated upon the map by the insertion of a black-headed pin. By this practice, a day-to-day record of the distribution of disease is maintained, interesting as a demonstration of the point of origin of an epidemic,and the grouping of its individual units and of special service in marking prominently the scene of its collective intensity. Attention is thus attracted to any section of the parish in which disease is prevalent, and attention once directed, secures to the inhabitants of the area indicated a close inspection of their houses and an examination into the detail of the sanitary condition of their surroundings. To this end also a separate book of reference is provided and allotted as a record to every street court and place in the parish, that in each, for every house a page may be set apart for the insertion of particulars relating to the drainage and the water supply, the sanitary condition, internal and external, and the incidence of epidemic disease. * These maps have been very skillfully reproduced from the original by Mr. Tear, junior, 12, Clapham Road, S.YV. 3 These books, 500 in all, are numbered and arranged in numerical order. A reference to their contents is facilitated by means of an index. The name of each street, in alphabetical sequence, followed by a number indicative of a corresponding volume, is printed in bold type. Easy access is thus afforded to the information which has been collected. From time to time, as the sanitary arrangements of houses become perfected, they are entered and described in their proper place, and as a whole page is allotted to each house, ample space is provided for a description in detail, of the position, the condition, and the structural efficiency of the appliances of sanitation. The date of the completion of sanitary improvements is considered worthy of a remark. The occurrence of epidemic disease is noted, and as this point is of considerable importance in a record, which claims for itself the preservation of a hygienic history of every house, the note is written in red ink. Although years must elapse before these volumes can contain facts sufficient to reflect the sanitary condition of the parish, yet month by month, and year by year, as accumulating evidence is recorded, they will bccome, as a store-house of information, increasingly valuable and useful. Now turning from that section of the work of the department which has for its object the collection, arrangement, and tabulation of facts relating to the causation and distribution of disease, let us glance at the practical work which has been accomplished during the year. Scarlet Fever existed in an epidemic form for the greater part of 1887. The number of cases rose month by month from January to September with little intermission until in the latter month the outbreak reached its climax, with a return of 197 cases, and again slowly subsided. During the year, 995 cases were reported. By their energetic action, the a 2 4 Sanitary Inspectors succeeded in obtaining the removal of 642 cases to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board. Doubtless by the early removal of these infected people, the onward progress of the epidemic received a severe check. The rooms and premises which had been occupied by patients suffering from Scarlet Fever were in all cases disinfected by means of sulphur vapour. The process adopted is a thorough one. The niches about the window and the opening at the fireplace arc covered with strips and sheets of pasted paper. A receptacle containing several pounds of ignited sulphur is placed for safety in an open iron vessel in the centre of the room. The door is then closed, and every crevice secured. Unopened for twenty-four hours, when entered the room is still misty with the vapour of sulphur. An impalpable yellow powder, discolouring the walls, the ceiling, and the floor, is found to have insinuated itself into every nook and cranny. No animal or vegetable life can survive this baptism of sulphur. Lime washing, scouring, stripping and re-papering is then ordered, and the work supervised by the inspector. Articles of clothing and utensils which have been used by the patient are steeped in a strong solution of carbolic acid. The bedding in the meantime has been conveyed to the wharf, and there, in the stove subjected to a moist heat ranging from 300 to 330 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat at which the stove is maintained is sufficiently high to scorch or even ignite the linen or cotton fabric of the article exposed. But the most delicate material is secured against the destructive effect of a high temperature by the saturation of the heated atmosphere with steam. Whilst the process is in operation, so moist indeed is the atmosphere, that should the doors of the stove be thrown open 5 before the closure of the steam jets, the articles when removed arc discovered to be saturated with water. This occurs from the condensation of the vapours engaged in the woven meshes of the cloth and in the interspaces of the bedding, by the sudden admission of a draught of cold air. That the articles may not be destroyed by contact with the heated metal, the stove is lined with sheet asbestos. Unless under exceptional circumstances, the stoving is completed in twenty minutes. The removal of infected articles and the return is accomplished by the employment of two vans, the one retained exclusively for the former purpose, the other for the latter. In September it was found necessary to put in force the powers conferred upon the Sanitary Authority by the 98th articlc of the codc of the Educational Department: "The managers must comply with any notice of the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the school is situated, requiring them, for a specified time, with a view to preventing the spread of disease, either to close the school or to exclude any scholar from attendance." Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria appeared in the neighbourhood of the Lyham Road Schools. Case after case occurred in rapid succession. It was found that in almost every instance a child of the family attacked, was, or had been, in attendance at the Board schools. The outbreak was a particularly fatal one. Twelve children died in a fortnight. Others were in a dangerous condition. An order was sent to the managers, and after some discussion the school was closed for one month. The children affected were either isolated or sent into hospital, and the outbreak in that district was at an end. Whilst the epidemic was in progress, the gutters and drains of the courts and alleys were periodically ilushed with a strong solution of carbolic acid. The people inhabiting 6 the adjacent houses were provided with a liberal supply of disinfecting powder for use in the dust bin. Every medical man engaged in practice in the parish was made acquainted by circular with the method of obtaining for his patient an expeditious removal to the Hospital of the Asylums Hoard. In order that delay might not result from any error or misapprehension in notification ; printed certificates, requiring only the mention of specific particulars, were supplied with the circular. In the ordinary course, when the rcgulations are observed, the removal of a patient is accomplished within the space of one hour from the receipt of notification by the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Communication was opened with the teachers of schools, both public and private, throughout the parish. A periodic return of absent scholars was secured. A visit was made to the house of the absentee by the Inspector, and the removal of many a case, which would otherwise have remained as a focus of contagion, was accomplished. In other cases where illness, infectious in character, was ascertained to exist, the attendance at school of children from the same family or house was interrupted by the veto of the teacher, obtained through the intervention of the inspector. The period of epidemic is the opportunity of the sanitary reformer. It is an occasion upon which the owner of property is peculiarly open to the influence of persuasion in regard to an improvement in the plan, or the efficiency, of the sanitary appliances of the infected premises. The opportunity of the moment was seized. The drainage in a large number of houses was thoroughly re-organized, and many sanitary improvements of a minor character effected. In other zymotic diseases disinfection is carried out upon the same system as that adopted in Scarlet Fever. The number of infected houses visited by the inspectors reached a 7 total of 1276. The appliances of sanitation in every case were examined, and when defective, placed in a condition of repair and efficiency. 3078 articles of bedding were removed to the stove and disinfected, 92 were considered unworthy of that process and destroyed in the furnace. The work of the department, in giving effect to the provisions of the Nuisances Removal Acts, is extensive. 2191 notices were served; these principally related to defects and stoppages in drains, defective water supply, dirty premises, and removal of manure. Under the provisions of the Metroplis Local Management Act the Inspectors served 426 notices for the reconstruction of drainage, the provision of water supply, the repair or replacement of dust-bins, the removal of swine, and the closure of underground rooms used for the purpose of dwellings. During the year under their supervision 2430 houses were placed in a condition of satisfactory sanitary repair. The slaughter houses and the cow houses, 72 and 63 in number respectively, were visited, and the bakehouses received special attention. The houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, were inspected periodically, and pamphlets containing the rules and regulations supplied. The particulars relating to structures which were found to be, on account of dilapidation, in a condition dangerous to the public safety in 26 instances were reported to the surveyors of the Metropolitan Board of Works. In pursuance of the intention of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 300 samples were procured and submitted to the analyst for examination. In ten percent. of the cases adulteration had been practised. In these, summonses were issued and convictions were 8 obtained, resulting in fines of a greater or less severity. Upon a second conviction for the adulteration of milk, a penalty of £7 was paid in one case. In the majority of cases, however, the fines were small, the Magistrates appearing reluctant in this respect to put in force the powers conferred upon them by the Act. Mortuary and Inquest Rooms.—On July 11th the attention of the Sanitary Committee was called by a report from the Medical Officer to the inconveniences which arise in the Outer Wards from the lack of mortuary accommodation, and to the desirability of providing not only a second mortuary, but inquest rooms in connection with the proposed and the existing mortuary. Although many sites have been viewed, some disqualifying particular has prevented the conclusion of an arrangement, and in consequence no definite action has been taken in regard to this matter. The report referred to is couched in the following terms: "I beg to bring before your notice a subject which requires your consideration. There is no Mortuary accommodation provided in the district covered by the five Outer Wards in the Parish for the cases where death has occurred from violence or from other causes in which it is convenient to make use of a public Mortuary. Hence, whilst the preliminary enquiry as to the cause of death is taking place, and until the Coroner's Court has delivered judgment and granted a certificate for burial, the body is retained in the private house or other inconvenient place, and at times to the injury of the health of the inmates. When a post-mortem examination is required it is made at great inconvenience and with considerable risk to the health not only of the medical man and his assistants, but of all those under the same roof. In the district to which I refer there is a population of 200,000, 9 and the inquests last year numbered 129. A Coroner's officer is appointed, whose sphere of action is limited by the boundaries of the district, and hence the existing Mortuary is not available, situated as it is within the jurisdiction of another Coroner's officer* Even if the present Mortuary were freely at the service of the Outer Wards, its situation at the extreme limit of the parish and its distance from the remoter parts stand in the way of its adoption. I would also ask you to consider the advisability of building suitable enquiry and waiting rooms in connection with the proposed and also with the existing Mortuary. Under the present circumstances, in order toobtain a room for the purpose of holding an enquiry, the Coroner is compelled to fall back upon the generosity and hospitality of the publican, and I venture to think that .1 public house is not a proper place for such an enquiry. The surroundings are not of a character that would impress the jury or the witnesses with the gravity which the occasion demands. The room provided not infrequently is small, badly ventilated, pervaded with the odour of tobacco and spirits, and is a cause of discomfort to the Coroner, the jury, and the witnesses. During the enquiry it is incumbcnt upon the jury to inspect the body, and this may not infrequently be deposited at a place some distance from the room of enquiry. It is also, in my opinion, an outrage upon the sensibility of those who are suffering from the ptagS of bereavement to be called upon to take part in an enquiry held in a place where they may be brought into contact with those who are the frequenters of a public bar. Having regard to the reasons already stated, and in order that nothing should be allowed to detract from the efficiency and solemnity of an enquiry, the issues of which are at times of considerable magnitude, I submit this matter for your earnest consideration. In six of the London Parishes, enquiry and waiting rooms are provided in connection with the Mortuary, 10 namely, in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark; St. Giles and St. George, Bloomsbury; St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell; St. Luke, Clerkenwell; St. Mary, Islington; and St. Luke, Chelsea. In ten, a Vestry Hall or School Room is used for the purpose; but in the other parishes the enquiry is held at the public house." Dust Storage and Removal.—On November 28th, upon the occasion of a scheme for the adoption of the pail system having been brought to the notice of the Sanitary Committee by Mr. Andrew, the Medical Officer submitted the following report:— "The scheme that has been brought forward by Mr. Andrew for the modification in the system of dust storage and removal, and which has for its object on the one hand the substitution of a small, cleanly, and portable receptacle in the place of the more capacious dust bin in common use, and upon the other hand the adoption of a measure for the frequent and regular removal of house refuse, commends itself as an advance in the direction of sanitary reform which may be expected to result in an improved condition in the public health. "The dust bin in general use is insanitary. When full, and when its contents are allowed to remain for some time unremoved, fermentation heats the central portion, moist with rain or with organic refuse, and a vapour of an unwholesome character is generated. When the dust bin is empty the porous and absorptive brickwork of which its walls in whole or in part are constructed, throws off an odour as offensive as that from the accumulated dust previous to its removal. This nuisance may not be observed when there is a considerable open space in the rear of the house. But when the houses are contiguous, and when their backs are closely approximated, 11 when the yards arc closed in and contracted, and when there is no free interchange of air the emanations from the dust bin must have an effect far from salutory upon the health of the inhabitants of those houses. The nuisance does not end here. At the fortnightly or monthly period, when the contents of the dust bin arc removed; the disturbance of the noxious accumulation and its conveyance through the dwelling house arc operations of a most inconvenient and insanitary character. "The vapour from decaying organic matter contains numerous microscopic organisms or putrefactive microbes, these, gaining access to the food stored in a receptacle which has a place in the back addition of the greater number of the houses to which I have referred, bring about a fermentative change and an early decomposition, and cause the food affected to be unwholesome or even unfitted for consumption. "Children are especially liable to the injurious effects of food which has undergone a fermentative change of this character. It is from this causc that the death rate from diarrhoea is augmented in the thickly populated districts. "Whether or not the system advocated by Mr. Andrew can be practically carried out in Lambeth, I will not give an opinion, but I am aware that the dust pail has already been successfully introduced into many large towns and populous parishes, and that it is highly appreciated by the inhabitants of those places. And I recommend, in the interest of public health and of household cleanliness, that the introduction of the dust pail be made the subject of experiment, in the first place, upon a limited scale and in a circumscribed district; and if the working of the system be found practical in operation, and beneficial in its results, that it be extended to the parish at large." 12 OVERCROWDED DISTRICTS AND OPEN SPACES. The year of the appearance of this Report is remarkable in the annals of the Parish on account of the agitation which has divided public opinion. The question of the purchase of land in Brixton and Vauxhall for the purpose of playground or park, has engaged local and even general attention. In the wards, discussion has driven the peaceable ratepayers into hostile camps. The Public Halls have been the scenes of motion and amendment. The Vestry has held late sittings. Resolutions have with difficulty been passed by the Board of Works. Even in Parliament bills promoted in aid have witnessed a division. But in spite of this manifest divergence in opinion, against the health aspect of the question, against the desirability or even the necessity of preserving open spaces for public recreation, neither one side nor the other has ventured to offer any argument. Indeed, those who are the bitterest opponents of the proposed schemes are eager to admit that war is not waged by them against the principle, but against the manner, in which it is proposed to carry that principle into effect. Upon the kernel of the question the people of Lambeth are in complete accord. The agitation in this and in other districts where enterprises of a like character have been set on foot, is only the surface manifestation of a deeper undercurrent of feeling which pervades the Metropolis. There is a widespread conviction that an element of danger exists in the steady advance and consolidation of brick and mortar, and in the Unrestricted absorption of open and unoccupied space. 13 Even they who are little accustomed to indulge in speculation in regard to the economic movements of the times, begin to suspect that all is not well in our social arrangements. They discover in the encroachments of the builder the divorce of the child from the physical culture of the playground, and recognise with anxiety the inevitable sequence in the march of events, that the street, with all the accompanying dangers, both of vice and accident, must eventually become the only place of recreation both for childhood and youth. The overcrowding at the centres of population, and the poverty and disease attendant upon that condition arc subjects which give rise to apprehensions and misgivings in regard to the reality of the boasted advance in our progress and civilization. Throughout England and W ales the distribution of population, which for centuries had remained fairly constant, within recent years has undergone a remarkable change. The displacement of large sections from rural to urban districts has led to a complete revolution in the social condition of the people. At this time two-thirds of the population of Great Britain live in towns. Annually this section is augmented by the addition to its number of over a quarter of a million. The figures of the Registrar General place this matter beyond the region of dispute. In extra urban districts the excess in the number of the births over that of the deaths is considerable. But that increment is more than neutralized by migration. A stream fed by rivulets from every village and hamlet flows constantly towards the town. Within the space of a few years, unless the current be retarded, the population of the country compared with that of the town must sink into fractional insignificance. The people of England are approaching that condition when as a race they are destined to become the dwellers in towns. 14 The addition of this influx, together with the normal increase of their own people, has placed upon the town districts a strain to which they are unequal. In proximity to the centres of business, every available plot of garden or recreation ground has been converted into building site. Houses constructed from materials of the poorest quality and by workmen employed only for the cheapness of their labour, have been hurried into occupation. The system of close building, at first confined in its application to the consolidation of the inner zone, has been adopted in the outer, and with the demand for shelter, which increases in a progressive ratio with the growth of the population, the once open suburbs must ere long become indistinguishable in the monotony of house row and pavement from Whitechapel or Hoxton. The art of close building appears to be a progressive one. In its infancy twenty years ago, the art has now arrived at a stage nearly approaching perfection. Between then and now, every step in an ascending scale of growth and development has its prototype, and is characterised in monuments discoverable in Lambeth. In the earlier examples, an examination of the ground-plan elicits the fact that the space allotted to garden land is more comprehensive in area than that dedicated to the plumb line and trowel. In the successive stages the size of the two quantities may be observed gradually to approximate until reaching an equality, they again diverge into unequal proportions now however at the expense of uncovered ground, and this until the final stage of development is attained, when the extreme limit of encroachment permitted by the Building Act is reached, and garden land is represented by a yard 100 superficial feet in area. The houses in Bonnington Square, Harleyford Road, although their arrangements admit of the preservation of a 15 greater space than the Building Act demands, are fair examples of that condition which cannot fail to become a common experience as the value of land becomes greater. For extreme examples in illustration of the acute stage of crowding house upon house within a limited area, we must look outside the boundaries of our own parish. In St. Luke's, a block of buildings known as the City Baths is notorious in this respect. One hundred rooms are comprised in this pile, fifty of which are almost dark even upon the brightest day. The little light which they receive they derive from a central shaft, but the enjoyment of space yard or area is unknown to the inhabitants. Before the Royal Commission upon the houses of the working classes, it was stated in evidence that during a house to house visitation in Clerkenwell, the fact was revealed that no back yard had been provided to a very large number of the houses. The rooms of certain houses in one instance are described as being dark, because, where the back area should be found, that which is termed a cottage "three stories high" had been built within two yards of the rear windows. Not only in London, but in Birmingham, Bristol, Doncaster, and many other provincial towns, we learn from the same source docs this over-crowding of land exist. Let us pause here, and consider the effect upon the physique of the people which has been induced by the prevalent system of close building, whereby the space necessary for the healthy indulgence by the young in games has been sacrificed and the overcrowding which has been found to exist has been rendered possible. The unhealthy inlfuence of close building falls especially 16 upon the poor and wage-earning class. The children of the wealthy and of those in easy circumstances of life, enjoy opportunities in regard to recreation unshared by the less fortunate. With them, distance from the scene of daily employment is not the insuperable obstacle. Residence may be chosen in consideration of the requirements of the family, and country and seaside change supplies a common alternative to the monotony of town life. The Royal Commissioners in their report upon the houses of the working classes speak of the effect which close building has upon health. "In St. Luke's, ophthalmia among the young is very prevalent and can be traced to the dark ill-ventilated crowded room in which they live. "Among adults too, overcrowding causes a vast amount of suffering which could be calculated by no bills of mortality however accurate. Even statistics of actual disease consequent on overcrowding would not convey the whole truth as to the loss of health caused by it to the labouring classes. That overcrowding lowers the general standard, that the people get depressed and weary, is the testimony of those who are daily witnesses of the lives of the poor. The general deterioration in the health of the people is a worse feature of overcrowding even than the encouragement by it of infectious disease. It has the effect of reducing their stamina and thus producing consumption and diseases arising from general debility of the system. Nothing stronger could be said in describing the effect of overcrowding than that it is even more destructive to general health than conducive to the spread of epidemic and contagious diseases." In the out-patient department of one of our large hospitals, evidence has been collected upon the condition 17 of the constitution of town dwellers and especially of those with a town-born ancestry. An eminent surgeon, Mr. Cantlie, has arrived at some startling conclusions. Among that section of the community from which the hospital out-patient is drawn in the first generation he finds a distinctive divergence from the normal type manifest by a reduction in height and weight, and a diminution in lung capacity; and in the second, symptoms of grave constitutional decay. Whilst this evidence from the Royal Commissioners and from the hospitals is still fresh, a note of warning reaches us from a quarter no less authoritative. The Director General of the Army Medical Department is a witness of no mean order. Speaking before the British Medical Association assembled in Dublin, Sir Thomas Crawford brought forward some interesting statistics. During the five years ending December, 1864, from among the young men presenting themselves for admission into the army, 371 in every 1000 were rejected by the Army Medical Officers upon examination. But in the period from 1882 to 1886, inclusive of those years, no less than 415 per 1000 fell below the standard required. In his summary, the highest army medical authority declares that the masses from which recruits are drawn "are of an inferior physique to that which they were 25 years ago." The largest percentage of rejections, Sir Thomas further goes on to show, occurred in those recruits which are drawn from town populations. In a closely reasoned article appearing in the "Nineteenth Century" of 1881, Lord Brabazon, who has identified himself with movements for the improvement in the condition of the working classes, and than whom no one has approached the subject in a more practical spirit, writes, "Our eyes are blinded with the evil effects of overcrowding by reason of the continued stream of fresh blood which is ever flowing from the B 18 more healthy districts into our towns, thus hindering and delaying the natural physical decay of the constitutions of the inhabitants of the latter, which would be otherwise more rapid,and consequently more apparent. If we could establish a thoroughly efficient blockade of our large cities, and allow no further immigration into them from the country, it would not be many years before the mortality of our centres of population, as compared with that in healthier districts, would be so marked, and the physical deterioration in our city populations would become so apparent, that we should be forced to take immediate steps to prevent their utter annihilation." When it is considered that the town populations are increasing enormously, and the country districts arc becoming depleted, the evidence of the Commissioners, Mr. Cantlie, Lord Brabazon, and Sir Thomas Crawford is of particular significance. Overcrowding is a term applied to two distinct conditions which, however, are invariably associated together. The one has reference to land upon which the houses are situated in that degree of close approximation that the provision of air, light, and space is reduced to a quantity below the standard requirements of health; the other to houses in which the inhabitants exceed in number the accommodation. Judged from a sanitary aspect in cause and effect each is observed to have an intimate dependence upon the other; both tend undoubtedly in an eminent degree to produce that deterioration in the physique of the poorer section of the community which has been the subject of investigation: alike, they derive their origin from causes which are more or less remediable in character. To examine exhaustively the causes of overcrowding would require more time and space than is now at my disposal. It is sufficient in this place to glance at some 19 of the leading defects in our social condition which are at the root of overcrowding and its attendant evils. The determining causes may be divided into two classes : those which derive an origin from outside the town or district affccted, and those which derive an origin from within. It has been shown above, that during late years there has been a continuous migration in progress from the country to the town districts, resulting in the displacement of large sections of the population. For what reason this movement, directed from the cottages of a thousand hamlets to converge upon the towns, is occasioned in England, whilst in France and other continental countries no such exodus has been observed, is one of the problems which sooner or later must be solved. Some light, however, may penetrate the haziness that surrounds this question when it is considered that, almost without exception, in other civilized countries the means of obtaining shelter and a modest competcnce is within the reach of every peasant, whilst in England, owing to the various disabilities which affect the land, no such influence is at work. That migration is exerting a severe pressure upon the urban districts cannot be doubted, when it is remembered that a contingent untrained in the pursuits of town life, many thousands in number, is annually thrown upon the labour market of London. Shifting the scene of causation to a position nearer to the region of discontent, it is interesting to observe the effect that an increasing population has upon the land in the vicinity of its growth; how an addition to numbers determines a rise in values; and how that extension in surface which should always be an accompaniment of augmented numbers is curtailed by the demand, the growth B 2 20 of population being thus in itself a hindrance to normal expansion. An illustration will make this argument clear. The population of London has rapidly increased. The augmented demand for shelter is perceptible in the rise of land values, not only throughout greater London, but in districts where the echoes from the distant town never penetrate. The belt of environing estates, the large proportion of which is still under tillage or horticulture, and yet unapproached by the builder, is estimated at a capital figure upon which no appreciable interest can be realized from any agricultural undertaking. For the transfer of the ownership of suburban land offers of even many thousand pounds per acre have been considered inadequate. But in the precincts of the busy centres, plots insignificant in dimensions have attained a fabulous quotation in the market. These prices, prohibitive except under the urgent necessities of extreme pressure, and increasing, pari passu, with demand, have seriously hindered expansion within these land nursing districts. Freehold plots rarely come into the market. Large areas remain in the hands of owners incapacitated by the terms of ownership from selling. Large areas fall within the grasp of speculators unwilling from motives of aggrandizement to realize. Whether inherited or acquired, the land seldom changes ownership. The values in the estate thus circumstanced augment, without the employment of either spade or trowel. No uncommon attribute either of mind or body is essential upon the part of the owner to the growth. Retentiveness is the quality which alone commands success. Neither is there any alloy mixed with this unearned gold. To the annual addition to capital value even the tax-gatherer is oblivious, and the rate collector does not venture the imposition of his toll. The peculiar position of influence and immunity, and the standpoint of prospective profit held by the freeholder is not 21 lightly abandoned. A partial relinquishment, however, is not of unfrequent occurrence. The occupational interest in land often limited to small plots associated with burdensome restrictions and incumbered by heavy annual rent charges is assigned for a term of years. The builder, in order that he may secure a profitable return upon his investment, must cater for the requirements of a class wealthier than that of the artizan. The demand for accommodation in town communities thus forges for itself an obstructive girdle of vested interest stronger than iron in the resistance which it offers to normal expansion. Meanwhile the pressure in the beleaguered town is becoming intolerable. There is a steady increase in population. There is a constant influx from the country. Expansive efforts prove abortive. The pressure resisted at the circumference recoils upon the centre. The demand for accommodation becomes urgent. Rent, which in a rural or small urban district would be deemed excessive, is offered and refused. Tenements of a meagre and confined description arc occupied by the families of workmen in receipt of more than an average income. The labourer whose work is intermittent and wages uncertain must be content with a single room, or even submit to joint occupation with another. In some districts the demand for shelter is so urgent that eager competition is witnessed for rooms dark and unwholesome. The evil of overcrowding is aggravated by causes which derive their origin from the effects of that condition itself. A lowered standard of health, always the accompaniment of close building, is a factor in the further increase of pressure in an already congested area. This undesirable end is accomplished by the operation of two forces, an elevated birth rate and a demand in the 22 labour market for physical strength. The birth rate bears a direct ratio to the density of an occupied area. When the space allotted to each individual is contracted to the smallest dimensions, the rate rises to its extreme altitude, but as that space widens the rate falls. The phenomenal birth rate in congested districts is due upon the one hand to the custom of early marriage, and upon the other to a high average in the number of the children resulting from that union. The unhealthy and impoverished female adds a burden to her resources at an annual period, whilst her more robust sister seldom at an earlier interval than a biennial. This rule, although by no means universal, generally obtains. Whether or no its operation is determined by ability on the part of the mothers to suckle the offspring, or from other causes, it is out of place here to enter into an enquiry. An unsatisfied demand in the labour market for physical strength is a necessary outcome of the declension of that quality in the district affected. Muscle and bone, in such a locality is at a premium, and that which cannot be supplied in its full development from within must be sought and obtained from without. The contractor serves his own interest by the importation of labour from a healthier district. By means of this expedient a higher standard of bodily strength is secured than could have been obtained had he limited his field of operations to the quarter in which perchance the work is about to be performed. The unsatisfied demands of the labour market, and the abnormal fecundity of the sex, are thus potentialities which derive their origin from the unhealthy atmosphere of overcrowded areas, and alike tend to the exaggeration of the evils of the condition from which they spring. Here, then, is a vicious circle of concurrent cause and effect. Overcrowding is the cause of physical weakness; 23 physical weakness results in an unsatisfied demand in the labour market; the unsatisfied demand is the cause of an influx from without; again that influx results in overcrowding. The causes which lie at the root of overcrowding, and determine that condition, briefly enumerated, are:- 1. The unrestricted occupation of building land, with bricks and mortar, to the exclusion of open space, and without reference to the hygienic requirements of the people. 2. The artificial value to which land in the vicinity of town districts has been raised by means of speculative holding. 3. The system of leasehold tenure, or dual ownership, in house property. 4. The demolition of artizans' dwellings, either for the purpose of public improvement, or in the course of individual or collective enterprise. 5. The land system, resulting in the discouragement of individual enterprise, and leading to the migration of rural populations into town areas. To these causes of overcrowding may be added those which derive their origin from that condition itself. 6. The elevated birth rate, characteristic of unhealthy and impoverished communities. 7. The existence in the labour market of an unsatisfied demand for muscular strength and skill, whilst at the same time the market is overstocked with men weak in physical capacity and unskilled in the arts of any craft. 24 These are the prominent causes which determine the existence of overcrowding. As a rational plan for the treatment of disease springs from an acquaintance with the mode of its origin, so efficient measures for the remedy of this social evil can only be discovered by the study of the factors of its causation. But before proceeding to the consideration of this section of the subject, the legislative enactments already directed towards the relief of overcrowded districts should be examined. The Sanitary Act of 1866 provides for the abatement of overcrowding, and Section 35 of the same Act, modified by a subsequent Amendment Act in 1874, empowers the Local Authority to make regulations for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. Lord Shaftesbury's Act, 1851, provides for the erection, purchase, or lease of lodging-houses for the working classes by means of a fund borrowed upon the mortgage of the fates. Cellar dwellings are dealt with by the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts of 1855 and 1862. Mr. Torrens' Act of 1868, with amending Acts of 1879 and 1882, provides for the improvement or demolition of dwellings occupied by the working classes, and for the building and maintenance of improved dwellings. The Artizans' Dwellings Improvement Act, commonly known as Sir Richard Cross's Act, was intended to accomplish upon a large scale that which by Mr. Torrens' Act is done for small areas. The Building Act defines the space to be allotted in the construction of new roads, and the uncovered area to be retained in the vicinity of the dwelling house. In that part of the Report of the Royal Commission assigned to the consideration of remedial measures the Vestries of the Metropolis are severely dealt with at the 25 hands of the Commissioners for the attitude which it is alleged they have maintained. The Commissioners declare that "half the difficulty" experienced in the solution of the problem would be met had the Acts conferring power upon those authorities been administered with disinterested intelligence and with energy. In justice to the Vestries it must be observed that although six Acts of Parliament take cognizance of the existence of this condition, in four alone arc the Vestries the recipients of power, and upon examination this number may be further reduced. Lord Shaftesbury's Act makes provision for the erection, purchase, or lease of lodging-houses for the working classes, But in order that this Act may be adopted a meeting specially convened for the purpose must be called upon the requisition of the Ratepayers. The resolution of adoption must be supported by at least two-thirds of the voters present in that assembly. Not until this stage has been reached has the Vestry any power to intervene. Then the Vestry is required to appoint Commissioners who are entitled, when elected, to borrow money upon the mortgage of the rates, and otherwise to put into effect the intention of the Act. Lord Shaftesbury's Act has practically remained a dead letter. The Vestries, however, have in no measure contributed to this failure in legislation. The Metropolis Local Management Act contains a provision in regard to the occupation of cellar dwellings. The officer of the Vestry has power to close a cellar-dwelling when the tenement docs not conform with the Act. This provision is stringently enlorced throughout the parish of Lambeth. The third Act is that of Mr. Torrens. This measure provides for the improvement or demolition of workmen s dwellings. 26 The Act also throws upon the Local Authority the onus of the purchase of the premises, should the owner, upon the order of the Vestry, refuse to proceed in the execution of the work required, or in the demolition of the unhealthy houses. The amount of compensation payable to the owner under the provisions of this Act is estimated upon an extravagant Scale, and the proceedings arc cumbrous and expensive. This Act, in consequence, has seldom been put into operation. Even the Commissioners themselves, in their Report, admit that the enforcement of this Act places a premium upon neglect on the part of the owner, and they on that account recommend the repeal of the Section having this effect. Lastly, we arrive at the consideration of the Sanitary Act of 1866, and the Sanitary Act Amendment Act of 1874. This Act empowers the Local Authority to define the occupational capacity of inhabited rooms held as separate tenements in houses occupied by members of more than one family, and in other particulars to provide for the sanitary requirements of the inmates. The 35th section of the Sanitary Act was adopted by the parish of Lambeth as early as 1871, and the powers which the adoption of that section confers have been in force throughout the parish of Lambeth since that date. The powers bearing upon the relief of overcrowded districts have been briefly summarised. A consideration of their nature demonstrates the fact that the Sanitary and the Metropolis Local Management Acts are alone the instruments which can be used by the Vestry in the relief of overcrowding. The Metropolis Local Management Act is, in this sense, limited in its operation to the occupants of cellar dwellings. Its effect upon a condition of overcrowding is almost infinitesimal. The Sanitary Act practically, then, is alone the legislative 27 enactment placed by Parliament in the hands of the Local Authority, which would enable it to deal with this great evil. The Commissioners, in their investigation into the condition of the class among which overcrowding is prevalent, discover that the average weekly wage in certain quarters amounts to twenty shillings a week; in others, sixteen; again, in others, twelve; and in some even ten shillings. Forty-six per cent. of this section of the community pay from one-fourth to one-half of their income in rent, 83 per cent. more than one-fifth; only 12 per cent. pay less than one-fifth. On the other hand, in the course of an inquiry extending throughout the poor quarters of the Metropolis, embracing an investigation into nearly 1,000 cases, the sum of 3s. 10¾d. is found to be the average weekly rental of the single-room tenement. The rent-paying capacity and the income of the labourer bear a definite relation one to the other. The recipient of a weekly wage of twelve or fourteen shillings, whatever be the number of his family, is unable to secure upon the present scale of rent-chargcs the occupancy of a greater space than a single room provides. To him the application of the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act is ineffective. Guilty of an offence against an Act with which he has not the means to comply, the labourer may be driven from tenement to tenement. A witness before the court of enquiry bears evidence to this effect: "The result of the enforcement of the parish regulations was that persons who did not like to submit to them, or for whom there was no room without overcrowding, had to leave the district and go to others where the Local Authority allowed people to live in whatever condition they pleased." The conception of this Act as a remedial measure in conditions of overcrowding is evidently 28 based upon the assumption that the poor huddle together in dark and unwholesome rooms in fulfilment of an unrestricted choice. It is true that a stringent local application of this Act secures a semblance of a definite local improvement; but, in reality, the body of the inhabitants is not regenerated, but its poorer members are displaced. Those whom poverty had coerced into close occupation before still remain in a condition which forbids them other than overcrowded occupation now. Necessity, in the vast majority of the cases, is the compulsory agent. The enforcement of the 35th Section may drive the impoverished family from district to district, from parish to parish, or ultimately from a position of selfreliance in the tenement to that of dependence in the workhouse; but the causes of overcrowding remain unaffected, notwithstanding the most energetic and stringent application of the measure. The Royal Commission recognize in overcrowding the root of the difficulties with which they must contend when they state: "In considering what are the effects, moral and material, of the present condition of the housing of the working classes, especially in the Metropolis, it will be convenient to deal with overcrowding as a centre evil around which most of the others group themselves." But it is evident that the Commissioners strangely overrate the efficiency of the powers vested in the Local Authority when they declare that half the difficulty of the question would have been met had these powers been administered with intelligence and disinterested energy; and further, when they place upon record an opinion that "there has been failure in administration rather than in legislation." These opinions cannot, however, be maintained in the face of the demonstrated facts. It has been shown, bearing upon the subject of over-crowding, that by four Acts of Parliament alone have powers been conferred upon the Vestry. 29 In one the initial action does not rest with the Local Authority, only at a later stage of the proceedings may the Vestry be called upon to intervene, nor has this power of intervention ever been invoked. In regard to the operation of the second, the Commissioners themselves are decided that a premium would be placed upon a neglect of duty on the part of the owner; and, in consequence, they recommend that the provisions having this effect be repealed. The third and fourth Acts arc, in principle, repressive; and in no point arc they levelled against the causes which determine overcrowding. Reviewing the nature of the powers vested in the local bodies it then becomes obvious that a higher authority than that of the Vestry is responsible for the condition of overcrowding from which we suffer to-day. To saddle responsibility upon the bodies to whom no power has been entrusted does not help forward the solution. No legislation worthy of the name has yet been framed to meet the difficulties of the problem. In order that the ground may be cleared to admit a right understanding of the remedial measures about to be proposed, it is well that the mind be disabused from the influence of arguments which have been urged in support of the Malthusian doctrine. By the logic of experience that doctrine has been proved untenable and the arguments which buttressed and supported the theory fallacious. An hypothesis which assumes that the population of England is in excess of the possibilities of the means of support provided by the resources of the country, is unworthy of credence. The assertion of the existence of a general condition of overpopulation, and the arguments which support the supposition, paraded upon the occurrence every social crisis that 30 has straitened the circumstances of the poor during the years of this century, have without exception been stultified by the tone of subsequent events. The absurdity of that doctrine which inspired McCulloch to prophesy that France in fifty years would be the pauper warren of Europe stands confessed in the position of that country to-day as the possessor of the richest peasantry in the world. That unchristian doctrine which recognises in disease and hunger the essential agents and familiar friends of progressive civilization has ever been an obstacle to reform and an advocate for inaction, and is largely responsible to-day for the overcrowding and poverty which are witnessed in our midst. The direction in which remedial legislation should proceed in order that the end in view be attained, is here indicated. (a.) The compulsory provision of space in the vicinity of the dwelling house, which would admit of a sufficient supply of air and light, and on the part of the young give facilities for recreative exercise. (b.) The counteraction of causes which have raised the rental value of town districts to an abnormal and speculative figure, and the removal of obstacles which are placed in the way of the expansion of town areas. (c.) The removal of impediments which stand in the way of the purchase by the tenant of the freehold of his dwelling. (d.) The interception at its origin of the stream of labour which pours into the town from the country districts, by the removal of disabilities which now effectually restrain the occupier in the purchase of the freehold, whether it be of cottage, garden land, allotment, or farm. 31 (e.) The enactment of statutory provisions, with safeguards against evasion, which would ensure accommodation for the families of workmen displaced from their dwellings either for the purpose of public improvement, or in the course of individual or collective enterprise. (/.) The elevation of the workman to a standpoint of greater advantage in regard to foreign competition, by a system of technical education. The compulsory provision of a space in the vicinity of the newly-built house, whether adjacent and enclosed, or upon a combined scheme where a plot would be the common recreation ground for many houses, is a reform which is demanded by the abuses which are exceedingly prevalent in the occupation of land by building. The present Building Act does not seriously face a condition which at times is so palpable in its evil effects that it becomes a public scandal. It might be thought that a provision, which has for its object the enlargement of the area dedicated to the purpose of individual occupation, whether that area be covered or open, would have the effect of increasing the relative amount chargeable to the builder or the rent levied upon the tenant. It might be urged that a piece of land which now costs a thousand pounds, and upon which four houses may be reared, would after an Act had been passed which limited the builder to the erection of two houses, still cost the same amount. The circumstances connected with the sale of land do not however warrant that conclusion. The value of land rises or falls in accordance with the capabilities which it offers for the erection of many or few houses. The market value of land offering a site for the erection of four houses, which now stands at a thousand pounds, would immediately decline to 32 five hundred, should it be found that two houses alone could be erected within the limits of its boundary. The morality of placing upon the owner the onus of the provision of a due amount of open space sufficient to satisfy the requirements of health, is not open to question. Whilst yet the estate is in the prospective stage of development, the plan of building should conform to this contingency. The public have the right to demand,and that right isalready recognised in principle in the Building Acts, that the house which is about to be built, and placed in the market for sale or occupation, shall be a dwelling in the real acceptation of the term, a house where health may be maintained and where children may be reared. Neither should the public be required in consequence of the default of the landowner, whether that default be individual or collective, to provide at a later date, at a great expense, spaces which are deemed to be the absolutely essential adjuncts to houses boasting the pretention of healthy habitations. Houses for the occupation of the working classes arc commonly built in groups. To apportion to each more than a yard sufficient for domestic requirement might be considered unnecessary, but a playground common to all might be furnished, and in the case where more than one owner is interested, this could be done upon a combined scheme and by proportionate contribution. The town occupier would then enjoy not only a yard offering a sufficient accommodation for the usual domestic offices, but in addition the right of user to the open space. In some isolated instances, both in London and in the provincial towns, either liberality or necessity has prompted the owner to adopt this scheme. In the cases which have been observed, the houses are tenanted by a middle class. Day by day, in the enclosure groups of children might be seen engaged in a variety of games. Indeed it is a rare occasion 33 upon which ground thus set apart is not the scene of youthful exercise. The amount of land which the owner relinquishes for the construction of new roads is in many instances insufficient. Forty feet, a dimension which in the framing of the Act was considered as a minimum contribution between forecourt and forecourt, has become in usage the maximum space between house front and house front. Mouses rising many stories in height, and abutting upon the pavement upon cither side of the carriage-way, may be observed in some of the later schemes of "town improvement." In suburban districts where new roads at no distant time may become the main arteries of commmunication between suburb and suburb, the provision of forty feet is an inadequate allowance. The Local Authority will be required at a later date, and at great expense, to purchase and set back the houses adjacent to these roads, in order that they may meet the demands of public convenience. The efforts which arc made by a community to extend the area of occupation and thus to meet the pressure of a growing population, arc thwarted by the attitude maintained by the owners of vacant land, and the abnormal value to which that commodity is elevated by speculative holding. A readjustment in the basis of assessment would have the effect of bringing home to the owner a responsibility in regard to public improvements. In the cost of these improvements he now has no share; but from the enhanced selling value of his property, the result of public expenditure, he derives a peculiar advantage. Besides, a fair readjustment would in a large measure tend to remove vacant land outside the field of the operations of the speculator. Upon this subject the Royal Commission were emphatic in their Report. "At present land available for building in the neighbour hood of our populous centres, though its capital value is very G 34 great, is probably producing a small yearly return until it is let for building. The owners of this land are rated, not in relation to the real value, but to the actual annual income. They can thus afford to keep their land out of the market, and to part with only small quantities, so as to raise the price beyond the natural monopoly price which the land would command by its advantages of position ; meantime the general expenditure of the town on improvements is increasing the value of their property." The Report goes on to show the advantages which might be derived from the rating of vacant land. "The owners of the building land would be forced to offer their land for sale, and thus their competition with one another would bring down the price of building land, and so diminish the tax in the shape of ground rent, or price paid for land which is now levied on urban enterprise by the adjacent landowners, a tax, be it remembered, which is no recompense for any industry or expenditure on their part, but is the natural result of the industry and activity of the town people themselves." Had the working man the opportunity within his reach, by thrift and perseverance, of becoming the landlord of his own house, those virtues discovered to be so useful in the attainment of that end would soon become common qualities among the labouring class. Let it once be generally recognised that this end is within the power of the average wage earner, and the elevation of that class from the hopeless condition of hand-to-mouth existence experienced by it to-day, to circumstances of comfort, if not of ease, is a foregone conclusion. Let it be granted that by an extension of the Building Act you have made the house a healthy home, whether it be a tenement or cottage, and that by the discouragement of speculative holding, you have brought that house within the reach of the labouring man. It is not a very wide step in advance, by a Leasehold Enfranchisement Act, to bring the 35 great mass of workmen's dwellings within the scope of the operations of philanthropic associations. The Artizans' Dwellings Association is a model in the footsteps oi which, doubtless, others would follow. Standing between the owner and occupier, this Company makes an arrangement by which the occupier may become his own freeholder upon the payment of the capital amount. The payment of that sum is spread over a term of years. The recipient of an average weekly wage, by the exercise of prudence and thrift, may in a limited number of years become the landlord of his holding. Were the obstacles removed that now stand in the way of the purchase in the rural district of farm or allotment, the prospective advantage of proprietorship, however small be the holding, would retain upon the soil many who now look towards the town with the hope of alleviating their condition. The industry of the peasant expended in healthful occupation upon his own plot would render the earth fruitful in a degree before unknown, and would stock the market with articles of consumption which now must be purchased from the foreigner; at the same time a harvest of muscle and sinew would be in process of cultivation that in times of peace would be a source of wealth, and in times of war a national defence. In parts of France, Belgium, and other Continental countries on account of the distribution of the population, and the numberless small freeholds scattered throughout the length and breadth of the country; manufacture may be conducted on a large scale in places many miles removed from the town. Labour in a sufficient quantity may be drawn from within an area of no great dimensions, and contiguous to the place of employment. The necessaries of life in a country of peasant proprietors are obtainable at a small cost. The labourer or mechanic, in consequence, is content with a low scale of wages. 36 During the working day the labour of the peasant, or that of members of his family, is engaged at the factory. During the evening, and in holiday time, upon his own freehold. Recreation with him brings profit. His wages arc inconsiderable, compared with those of the artizan of England, but his condition in life is vastly superior. Old age does not so surely bring want and dependence, nor docs failing strength deprive the peasant freeholder of the comforts and consolations of home. Under those conditions the scenes of the employment of labour do not become centralized, nor does the competition for shelter in town districts make rent the consumer of so large a share of wages. In the foregoing pages I have endeavoured to show that the condition of overcrowding, as it exists at present and in its prospective incidence, is a question which demands the serious attention of Parliament; that the action of the Local Authority, although useful in mitigating the evil effects of overcrowding, in the present condition of the law, is powerless in producing any influence upon the cause; that overcrowding is existant from a failure in legislation, and not from a failure in administration; that if the question were comprehensively dealt with, the problem of the relief of the unemployed would at the same time undergo a solution; and lastly, that the health of the nation is in a large measure dependent upon the relief of the overcrowded condition of the town districts. 37 DISTRICT POPULATION.

The registration district Waterloo Road First, is the most thickly populated, the average being 247 persons to the acre; Lambeth Church Second has 241 persons to the acre; Lambeth Church First, on account of the inclusion of the Palace Grounds and a portion of the Embankment within its area, numbers only 133 to the acre; whilst an acre in Brixton and Norwood is respectively inhabited by 48 and 20 persons. 38 THE BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered in Lambeth during the year 1887 having reached a total of 9110 cases are 63 in excess of the number registered in the previous year. The registered number of male children exceeds by 288 that of the female. During the same period in the entire Metropolitan area 133,075 births are recorded. The table shows the number of births registered in each year for the last ten years:— Year. No. of Births. Year.

The number of marriages celebrated in Lambeth show a decrease upon last year of 118. Like the birth rate the marriage rate has fallen year by year, and the number of marriages is diminishing notwithstanding the increase of the population. The marriages registered this year are fewer in number than in any annual return made during the last decade. Year. No. of Marriages. Year.

Thus in the year 1886, five persons fewer in every thousand were married than in the year 1877. The marriage rate of Lambeth for 1886 is 14.8 per 1000. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 16.2 per 1000, 41 The Table shows the condition of the population as regards marriage, single life and widowhood, in the various ages previous:— All Ages. 15 to 20. 20 to 25. 25 to 35. 35 to 45. 45 to 55. 55 to 65. 65 and upwards Unmarried, Male 71,863 10,875 8811 6,218 1,765 727 381 217 ,, Female 78,526 12,567 9088 6,707 2,705 1622 1143 873 Married, Male 43,509 51 2512 13,575 12,538 7969 4722 2152 ,, Female 44,458 371 4446 15,215 12,129 7157 3733 1407 Widowed, Male 3,805 — 20 268 555 733 921 1307 ,, Female / 11,539 4 64 670 1,665 2411 3023 3702 *Census 1881. 42 DEATH RATE. The deaths from all causes, registered in Lambeth during the year 1887, were 5415, of these 2819 were males and 2596 females. This number includes the deaths of 437 persons who had been removed to the Hospitals situated in Lambeth bat who had previously lived in other parishes of the Metropolis; on the other hand 227 parishioners died in the outlying institutions in the Metropolis, and 87 parishioners died in extra Metropolitan institutions. Having deducted the former and added the latter, the number of deaths proper to Lambeth is 5292, representing a drath rate of 19.0 per 1000 persons living. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 19.6 per 1000. In the Metropolis the registered deaths numbered 82,208, and the rate was the lowest on record. Since the present system of civil registration began, the death rate in the five great groups of districts is as follows:- South Districts 18.7 West Districts 18.0 Central Districts 26.2 North Districts 17.7 East Districts 21.9 The following Table shows the mortality, male and female, in the different districts, and a comparison of the deaths in each quarter.

The mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases includes 856 parishioners and 81 strangers, being an increase of 136 upon last year's figures. Deducting the number of the strangers and adding the number of the deaths of parishioners who died in the outlying institutions, the total number of Zymotic deaths proper to Lambeth is 808. This represents a Zymotic death rate of 8.9 per 1000, the metropolitan rate for the same period being 3.0 per 1000. In the following table the Zymotic death rate is compared in the different districts of the Parish, both for the whole year and each quarter of the year, strangers deducted. March June Sept. Dec.

From this disease during the year 1887 one death alone occurrcd. The case was that of a man who lived at Norwood, but had his daily employment at Pimlico. The attack was fatal after a few days' illness. The origin of the infection could not be ascertained. No other case was known to exist in the Metropolis at that time, nor was it believed that the subject of the attack had had any communication or connection with anybody residing outside the boundary of the London Registration Districts. Immediately upon the occurrence of death a removal was effected to the public mortuary. In order to confirm the evidence of the cause of death a post-mortem examination was made by your Medical Officer. Making a total during the nine years of 2320, of which 118 were paupers, or, Non-paupers 95.2 Per cent. Paupers 4.8 Per cent.

Scarlct Fever assumed an epidemic form throughout the Parish of Lambeth during the year 1887. The incidence of the disease in 995 cases was brought within the knowledge of the Sanitary Inspectors. Doubtless many were affected whose illness was not of a fatal character and about whom the Inspectors received no information. Indeed the number in the latter category must have exceeded that in the former. The Sanitary department in a great measure is dependent for information in regard to epidemic disease upon uncertain and erratic sources. No system of compulsory notification is in practice. A fatal termination of course secures a specific return, but that at a time when sanitary measures are of little avail. Then the initial stage of prevention has been permitted to lapse, and with it the opportunity of limiting the contagion to the person affected. Medical practitioners, clergymen, school teachers and district visitors, give the department much voluntary aid in securing the isolation of affected persons. In this epidemic, as in former outbreaks of Scarlet Fever, the young were chiefly affected. 330 cases occurred in infants below 5 years of age, 864 in children not yet 14 years of age, whilst 15 cases alone occurred in persons above 30 years of age. The distribution of the disease is distinctly indicated upon the map which refers to Scarlet Fever and accompanies this Report. The black points may be observed in clusters in the Marsh Wards, and again in Vauxhall, whilst a small group is apparent in the vicinity of the Stockwell Fever Hospital. 56 The Table shows the number of parishioners reported to be suffering from Scarlet Fever, including the cases removed to the Hospital.
