To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barnes. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1942 on the sanitary circumstances, the sanitary administration, and the vital statistics of the Borough. In accordance with Ministry of Health instructions this Annual Report has been curtailed and has been set out on the lines indicated in the introductory letter contained in my Report for 1940. As before I desire to express appreciation of the support afforded me by the Council and to the staff of the Public Health Department for their continued co-operation and devotion to duty. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. F. TWINING McMATH, Medical Officer of Heailh. 4 BOROUGH OF BARNES. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1942. PREFACE. In view of the pressure of work in public health departments of local authorities and the need for strict economy in the use of paper, this Report, in accordance with the requirements of Ministry of Health Circular No. 2,773, has been confined to essential and urgent matters which have affected the public health during the year. Accordingly I have to make observations only under the headings which follow. OFFICES. Owing to the increased number of staff of the Public Health Department due to many additional provisions undertaken, it was necessary to obtain larger premises as offices. On the 22nd January, 1942 the Public Health Department was transferred to 394, Upper Richmond Road, East Sheen. STAFF. The following changes in staff occurred during the year. Mrs. J. Scullard was appointed on 6th September, 1942, filling the position originally held by Mrs. M. Wall. As a result of the increased work of the department generally it was decided to appoint a temporary clerk to act as telephonist. Miss J. Campbell commenced duties in this capacity on the 28th July, 1942. The Matron of the Borough Infectious Diseases Hospital having married, the Council decided that her appointment as Matron on the permanent staff be terminated on the 15th May, 1942 and that she be appointed in a temporary capacity as from the 16th May, 1942. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT. The suspension of routine housing inspections and similar inspections in accordance with Ministry of Health instructions still continues. Work in connection with housing has been restricted to remedying defective conditions in dwelling-houses discovered in the course of other work, or on complaint. 5 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Particulars of the incidence and distribution of the cases of infectious disease notified during the year 1942 are set out in Tahles 21-25 in the Appendix, in which the number of cases removed to hospital and the number of deaths in the district from these diseases are also given. It will be seen by reference to the statistics referred to that measles showed a considerably higher incidence in Barnes than in the country as a whole. This high incidence is no doubt largely accounted for by the fact that there had been few cases of measles during the previous three years and consequently there were more children susceptible to this infection. None of the cases of diphtheria occurring during the year had received a course of immunising injections. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. In October, 1942, a six weeks' propaganda scheme was initiated in an endeavour to secure the immunisation of as many children as possible between the ages of 1 and 15 years. The campaign included the use of banners, press advertising, posters, pamphlets and word-of mouth publicity by ministers of religion, organisations, etc. PRECAUTIONS AGAINST WHOOPING COUGH. In December, 1941, the Council adopted a scheme for the free inoculation against whooping cough of the following groups of children (a) aged 6 months to 5 years; (b) definite or suspected contacts of any age. The inoculation consists of four injections, followed by a fifth injection in the case of children under five years shortly before they attend school, or, at any time, if a child is known to have come into contact with a case of whooping cough. It was decided to commence the inoculations in the first instance among the children attending the two Borough War-Time Day Nurseries. At the end of the year 34 of the children attending were receiving these protective injections. LOUSE-BORNE TYPHUS FEVER. In May, 1942 a scheme for the hospital treatment of Typhus Fever was instituted in the County of Surrey, the Borough of Barnes being one of the Authorities co-operating. Arrangements were also made for the cleansing and isolation of contacts of patients and for the disinfestation of bedding and household effects. For this purpose a team of seven members of the Public Health Department staff (including members of the staff at the Hospital) have been equipped with the necessary protective clothing, and such other precautionary measures have been taken in order that the scheme may be put into immediate operation, should the necessity arise. 6 INFECTIOUS DISEASES HOSPITAL. I think it wise to record the great difficulties experienced since the loss of the cubicle block at the hospital. Owing to the number of various diseases, mixed infections and observation cases requiring treatment it is often very difficult to find accommodation for patients in spite of the fact that there may be quite a number of empty beds throughout the wards. Further, if cubicles were available it would be more economical for nursing and running costs. However, owing to the shortage of labour and materials the question of the provision of a new cubicle block has been postponed until the end of the war. CLEANSING STATION. In accordance with the Council's decision a male cleansing attendant was appointed in April, 1942 at the Borough Cleansing Station, which had been placed under the direct control of the Medical Officer of Health. It was not possible, however, to obtain a suitable female cleansing attendant until May, 1942. In the case of each of these employees it was arranged that when not engaged on cleansing duties they should be employed at the Borough Infectious Diseases Hospital. During the year the Scabies Order, 1942 came into operation, whereby powers were granted to the Medical Officer of Health for the control, prevention and treatment of persons suffering from scabies. Most of the provisions advised in this Order were already in operation in the Borough of Barnes. BOROUGH ACCIDENT AND GENERAL PURPOSES AMBULANCE SERVICE. This service was placed under the control of the Medical Officer of Health in December, 1941. During 1942, owing to the fact that the firemen were all trained in first aid and owing to the difficulty experienced in obtaining trained substitutes for them, the accident ambulance continued to be manned by personnel of the Fire Service. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. The birth-rate for Barnes for 1942 was 14.5 per 1,000 population, contrasted with 11.6 the previous year. This birth-rate is the highest recorded in the borough since 1926. As a result of the Council's representations, permission was received from the Ministry of Health to establish two whole-time day nurseries in the borough for the care of children of mothers in employment. Suitable premises were obtained, adapted and equipped with the result that a nursery in the Barnes parish was opened on the 23rd September, and one in the Mortlake parish on the 26th October, 1942, for 45 and 50 children respectively. The staffs of each of these nurseries have been provided in accordance with the standards laid down by the Ministry of Health. borough of Barnes. appendix to the ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health 1942. 8 STATISTICS and TABLES.
