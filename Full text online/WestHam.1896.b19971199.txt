Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Tenth Annual Report as your Medical Officer of Health. The Report deals with the year 1896, and in it I am instructed, by the order of the Local Government Board, to include a summary of the action taken by the Sanitary Authority during the year for preventing the spread of disease, and also an account of the sanitary state of the district generally at the end of the year. It is obvious that there are many matters having direct or indirect effect upon the public health with respect to which the Council has taken action through the Engineer's Department, and which therefore need only a passing, if any, reference in this Report. Area and Population.—The County Borough comprises 4,706 acres. The enumerated population in 1891 (census) was 204,903, and the inhabitated houses numbered 32,066, giving an average of 6'3 persons to a house, and 43.5 persons to an acre. The estimated population, according to the Registrar General, for the middle of 1896 should be 261,279. There is no reason to suppose that the ratio of persons to houses has increased, and calculating upon this basis from the number of inhabitated houses it would appear that the foregoing estimate is too high. I have on various occasions pointed out my A 2 4 preference for a figure which shall err on. the side of under-estimating the population than over-estimating it, the latter course merelyresulting in 10 years' false feeling of security followed by a rude awakening. I therefore use for the purpose of this Report, and indeed have so used throughout the year in my regular reports, the figure 240,000 as the population of the Borough at the middle of 1896, which allows 51 persons to an acre. Births.—During the year 8,519 births were registered, being a decrease of 72 as compared with last year, and giving an annual birthrate of 35.4 per 1,000. This is the only year in which a regular annual increase in the number of births has been broken since 1883, with the exception of 1887, when there was a decrease of 210. The birth-rate of the 33 largest English towns was 30'7, and the West Ham rate was only exceeded by one town, viz., Gateshead (35.8). The registration districts of the northern division of the Borough are not co-terminous with the Municipal Wards, therefore, in distributing the births to their respective wards I am compelled to join Stratford with Forest Gate. For the same reason the difficulty in estimating the population mentioned above is magnified in attempting to gauge that of each separate district. separate district, Too much reliance must not be placed, therefore, upon the ratio for the localities given below:— Births. Birth-rate per 1,000 of Population. Northern Division Stratford 1,650 31.6 Forest Gate 1,643 Plaistow Ward 2,740 37.2 Canning Town Ward 2,486 30.9 5 The mean birth-rate duping the past 14 years was 38.6 per 1000. The diagram below illustrates the percentage variation from that mean. Deaths.—The total deaths of West Ham during the year numbered 4,395, including 3,857 registered in the Borough by the local Registrars (from which 44 must be deducted as being deaths of nonresidents), 325 registered as occurring in the Workhouse, and 257 deaths of West Ham Inhabitants which took place in hospitals and other institutions within the metropolis. This number of deaths is 261 less than that of last year, and 170 less than that of 1893, giving a death-rate for the year of 18.9 per 1,000, which was the mean deathrate of the 33 great towns for the same period. It was .3 per 1,000 above that of London (18.6), but was lower than the rates of the following towns:—Liverpool (22.7), Manchester (22.6), Salford (22.6), Birmingham (20.8), Preston (20.8), Bolton (20.7), Oldham (20.3), Wolverhampton (20), Sunderland (19.8), Plymouth (19.6), Birkenhead (19.2), Sheffield (19.3), Gateshead (19.1). 6 The mean annual death rate of the Borough during the past 14 years was 19.4 per 1,000. The diagram given below illustrates the variation from that mean. As before stated, the sources of information being unreliable, and the margin of error being too great to warrant me in attempting an accurate death-rate of each Municipal Ward, I have this year taken certain defined areas in different parts of the Borough for comparison. The four districts chosen were (1) The Woodgrange Estate, comprising the four roads, Hampton, Osborne, Claremont and Windsor, lying between Woodgrange Road and Balmoral Road; (2) The Stratford Marsh, comprising the streets bounded on north by High Street, south by West Ham Gas Works, west by Metropolitan Outfall Sewer, and east by Channelsea River; (3) Old Canning Town, comprising all the streets to the west of Canning Town Railway Station, and (4) Croydon Road area, comprising all the streets lying between Hermit Road and Chargeable Lane in one direction, and between Barking Road and the Hermit Road Recreation Ground in the other direction. 7 In order to obtain the enumerated population and inhabited houses in these several areas, sent Reply Post Cards to the occupier of each house in the Woodgrange area, asking for particulars to be filled in, my request being met with a most ready response. In the other areas my Inspectors made a house to house call. The populations thus arrived at are probably as accurate as it is possible to obtain, except by means of an official census. Any error likely to arise would occur in the poorer districts in cases of overcrowded houses, with which nuisance it might be considered undesirable on the part of the tenant to acquaint the Inspector. Such errors, however, must have been few, and in any case would merely tend to reduce rather than to increase the death-rate. In the Table below I give a summary of my calculations :— District. Houses. Population. Number of Persons per House No. of Deaths. Deathrate per 1,000. Woodgrange Area 447 2,293 5 22 9-6 Stratford Marsh Area... 432 2,966 6-9 82 20-7 Old Canning Town Area 545 3,585 6-6 100 27-9 Croydon Road Area ... 1,026 6,503 6-3 123 18-9 The above Table suggests that during last year the health conditions of the Woodgrange area were twice as favourable as those of the Borough generally, and three times as favourable as those pertaining to Old Canning Town. pertaining to Old Canning Town. As might be expected from the number of persons per house shown above, the proportion of children in the Woodgrange area differs greatly from that of the other districts.

This was .2 per 1,000 above the mean zymotic death-rate during the past 14 years, which averaged 3.7. In the matter of zymotic death-rate West Ham frequently holds an unenviable position, and last year proved no exception to this rule. According to the Registrar General the average zymotic rate of the 32 largest English towns was 2.6 per 1,000, a figure much below that 9 of West Ham, indeed our zymotic death-rate of 3.9 was the highest for the year with the exception of Salford (4.1). This general high zymotic rate is a matter calling for serious attention with a view to its improvement. It must be remembered, however, that up till last year we were without any means of isolation for these diseases other than small-pox, and even now our accommodation is very much below that requisite. In the Table below I give the monthly statistics for the four chief zymotic diseases usually isolated:— Month. Small-pox. Scarlatina. Diphtheria. Enteric fever Notified Cases. Deaths Notified Cases.

The small-pox cases which occurred during the first half of the year were a rekindling of the 1893-94 epidemic, and were almost entirely localised to the districts north and south of the Barking Road. During 1896 the Gloucester epidemic spread to several towns in the midlands, but no case, so far as I could discover, was imported into West Ham from that district; 55 out of 59 cases were isolated at the Hospital Ships, and the promptitude with which the cases are removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board ambulances is, in my opinion, very largely responsible for the steady decline in the epidemic. Vaccination.—On September 16th, 1896, I reported to the Council as follows:— It is satisfactory to call attention to the publication of the Report of the Royal Commission of Vaccination, and especially to the conclusions formulated by the Commissioners after their exhaustive enquiry, which I quote below—conclusions which more than justify your Council, as the Urban Sanitary Authority, in using every endeavour to ensure the efficient vaccination and re-vaccination of the entire Borough. "377. We have not disregarded the arguments adduced for the purpose of showing that a belief in vaccination is unsupported by a just view of the facts. We have endeavoured to give full weight to them. Having done so, it has appeared to us impossible to resist the conclusion that vaccination has a protective effect in relation to small-pox. "We think:— "(1) That it diminishes the liability to be attacked by the disease. "(2) That it modifies the character of the disease and renders it (a) less fatal and (b) of a milder and less severe type. 11 "(3) That the protection it affords against attacks of the disease is greatest during the years immediately succeeding the operation of vaccination. It is impossible to fix with precision the length of this period of highest protection. Though not in all cases the same, if a period is to be fixed, it might, we think, fairly be said to cover in general a period of nine or ten years. "(4) That after the lapse of the period of highest protective potency, the efficacy of vaccination to protect against attack rapidly diminishes, but that it is still considerable in the next quinquennium, and possibly never altogether ceases. "(5) That its power to modify the character of the disease is also greatest in the period in which its power to protect from attack is greatest, but that its power thus to modify the disease does not diminish as rapidly as its protective influence against attacks, and its efficacy during the later period of life to modify the disease is still very considerable. "(6) That re-vaccination restores the protection which lapse of time has diminished, but the evidence shows that this protection again diminishes, and that to ensure the highest degree of protection which vaccination can give, the operation should be at intervals repeated. "(7) That the beneficial effects of vaccination are most experienced by those in whose case it has been most thorough. We think it may fairly be concluded that where the vaccine matter has been inserted in three or four places, it is more effectual than when introduced into one or two plnces only; and that if the vaccination marks are of an area of half a square inch, they indicate a better state of protection than if their area be at all considerably below this." "434. A careful examination of the facts which have been brought under our notice has enabled us to arrive at the conclusion that, although some of the dangers said to attend vaccination are undoubtedly real and not inconsiderable in gross amount, yet 12 when considered in relation to the extent of vaccination work done, they are insignificant. There is reason further to believe that they are diminishing under the better precautions of the present day, and with the addition of the further precautions which experience suggests, will do so still more in the future." "503. We can see nothing then to warrant the conclusion that in this country vaccination might safely be abandoned and replaced by a system of isolation. If such a change were made in our method of dealing with small-pox, and that which had been substituted for vaccination proved ineffectual to prevent the spread of the disease (it is not suggested that it could diminish its severity in those attacked), it is impossible to contemplate the consequences without dismay." "508. In connection with the subject with which we have been dealing, we may advert to the suggestion that the vaccination and sanitary authority should in all cases be identical. . . . We are not in a position to devise a scheme which would accomplish either wholly or partially the desired result. At the same time we fully recognise the importance of achieving it as far as possible, and we should regard with favour such changes as would render the amalgamation of vaccination and sanitary authorities feasible, or indeed any steps taken in that direction, even although they should only partially effect the object in view." "509. From the views which we have expressed on the subject of vaccination, and on the absence of proof that any practical alternative exists which could be relied on to accomplish the same results if vaccination fell into disuse, it follows that we are of opinion that the State ought to continue to promote the vaccination of the people. Nor are we prepared to recommend that the State should cease to require vaccination, and trust entirely to a voluntary adoption of the practice." "511. . . . To secure that vaccination should be as widespread 13 as possible is, we think, the object to be kept primarily in view." The other zymotic diseases (measles, whooping-cough, and diarrhoea) usually affect the zymotic death-rate to a greater extent, and are less easily combated by sanitary administration than the four diseases mentioned above. In the first place the popular imagination largely discounts the gravity of these cases, and looks upon measles and whooping cough as almost a necessary evil of child life, nearly akin to the physiological process of dentition Again, the acute stage of measles being usually short, the disease is assumed to have terminated with the disappearance of the rash, many cases receiving no medical attendance at all, with the result that most of the fatal cases are due to intercurrent diseases during the period of convalescence. It is impracticable to put in force the triple line cf sanitary defenceadopted in dealing with the other zymotics, viz., universal notification, Hospital isolation, and official disinfection, both on account of the cost and of the early virulence of the infection. Notification has been adopted in some towns in the case of measles, with varying and doubtful results, but no authority, so far as I am aware, has attempted hospital isolation on sufficiently large scale to cope with any given severe epidemic. It would appear that nothing but a gradual education of the poorer classes as to the danger of these diseases and the best method of treatment, is likely to produce definite and positive results. And it is here, I believe, that the role of the woman inspector, offers the best hope of sanitary salvation, a woman inspector, who, being a trained district nurse could devote herself to teaching the poorer mothers how to rationally rear their bottle-fed infants, and how to avoid the dangers due to an ignorant treatment of the foregoing diseases, the especial assailants of infancy, working, it may be, through years of patient routine without any apparent immediate results, but gradually accumulating an educational reserve of immense value to the well-being of the Borough in more ways than that originally intended. That there is ample reason for some attempt in this direction, is proved by the fact that more than 3,000 deaths from these 14 three diseases alone occurred during the last 6 years, as is shown in the Table below. Year. Deaths from Meaales. Deaths from Whooping Cough.

The Table below is extracted from the periodical reports of the Astronomer Royal. From this it will be noted that the year 1896 practically divided itself into two parts, the first seven months being warmer than usual, and the last five months colder. The mean temperature of the year was 50.2°, being well above the mean temperature for the last 50 years. The coldest day of the year was February 25th, when the temperature was 24'3", and the hottest day was July 14th, the temperature then rising to 91.l0. Rain fell on 155 days in the year, the total rainfall being 22.05 inches. This chiefly occurred during the last five months, and partly explains the lower average temperature during that period. The registered sunshine for the whole year amounted to 1,017 hours. Week ending. Highest. Lowest. Mean for Week. Departure from average 50 years. No. of Rainy Days. Sum. for week, in inches.

How it came about that a population of over 200,000 remained so long without such isolation, and what were the difficulties the Council had to meet before they were able to open the hospital, form an interesting chapter in the sanitary history of the Corporation, which need not be further considered in the present report, it is sufficient to notice the commencement of what, I trust, when fully completed, will prove a powerful arm of the Public Health service. On January 1st two wards accommodating 36 cases of diphtheria were opened, and during the first two months I sent in 35 cases. With the opening of the wards, however, diphther ia cases fell markedly in number, and after consultation with Dr. Biernacki, the Medical Superintendent, it was decided to use the wards for scarlet fever instead of diphtheria. Early in March, the wards having been cleaned and prepared, this plan was adopted, and from that period till the end of the year I sent in 168 cases of scarlet fever. In the mean time the second pavilion of two wards were furnished to receive diphtheria cases, which we were again able to isolate from the middle of July. In all 126 cases of this disease were taken from their houses in the Borough for treatment at the hospital. The accommodation for diphtheria is at present ample, but the scarlet fever wards have been full from the time they were opened, and I have had almost daily to refuse to send in cases where the friends were willing and anxious for their removal. Up to last year it was easy to explain to one and all that there was no hospital and that, therefore, cases must be treated at home, but now that the hospital is opened, and the scarlet fever wards chronically full, it is becoming increasingly difficult to discriminate which cases shall be sent in, and, indeed, as very frequently happens eases particularly requiring removal from home occur when there is no chance of their reception at the hospital. 18 I have before shown that over 1,600 cases of scarlet fever alone were notified during the year, and that we only dealt with one-tenth of this number by hospital isolation. When, too, it is remembered that nearly all the largest employers of labour now require the enforced idleness of those employes who come from a house containing a case of infectious disease, that the Police and Postal service have rigid rules of the same character, and that the Borough is riddled with small food and milk businesses carried on in cottages where, however possible isolation may be in theory, the practical dangers of treating the case at home are innumerable, it is evident that our hospital is now of more use to the favoured individual than to the community, and that to serve the purposes of the latter a larger number of beds is imperative. Your Public Health Committee has now before it the consideration of this important subject, and I hope the Council will, in its decision, also recognise the claims of the poorer inhabitants who are attacked with enteric fever. This is a disease peculiarly fitted for hospital treatment, provided always the cases are removed in the early stage of the disease. Although infectious, almost solely by means of the bowel discharges, and consequently in competent hands comparatively easy to isolate, the course of the illness is so long and the complications liable to arise are so many, sudden, and severe, that a working-class community is probably more handicapped in the treatment of this disease than of any other infection. General Sanitary Administration.—In the appendix will be found a list of nuisances dealt with by the Inspectors during the year, chiefly under the Public Health Act, 1875. Many of these in themselves cannot be said to be injurious to health, though they are sufficiently inimical to comfort to be considered nuisances. Little difficulty is experienced in dealing with the graver nuisances which from time to time engage the attention of the sanitary staff, but the Inspectors have to pay many unnecessary visits in order to secure the remedying of these minor defects, the several items on the notice being carried out piecemeal and at odd times. Hitherto it has been the practice, in addition to the statutory notice, to send one or more letters of warning to the owner. Looking to the time lost 19 to the Department, which might be used in other directions, it is questionable whether I ought not to be empowered to institute proceedings on failure to comply with the notice, without giving additional letters. Unhealthy Dwelling-houses. — Under the Housing of Working Classes Act, 1890, I reported during the year the following houses as being in a state so dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation, viz.

Experience in working, since the passing of this Act, has shown that for facility in closing an unhealthy house, sec. 97 of Public Health Act, 1875, is much the more useful provision, and hitherto one has restricted action, under the Housing of Working Classes Act, to those cases in which the nuisances requiring abatement were so numerous as to require a notice in the form of a " specification," or to those cases in which it was easier to point out the defects than to specify the remedy. The above-mentioned houses fall within these two classes. Thorne Villas form an excellent example of the first class—a block of sixteen three-roomed tenements—never free from visits of the Sanitary Inspector, and yet seldom long, in a habitable condition. After closure and change of ownership, extensive work was carried out from basement to roof, a responsible caretaker lodged in one tenement, and, I suspect, a judicious selection of tenants made; since when there has been no need for action by the Sanitary Officials. The houses in Helena Road and First Avenue were reported in consequence of their being subject to a perpetual plague of slugs, the ground floors being nightly invaded by, in many cases, dozens of these B 2 20 molluscs. No sincere attempt to remedy the nuisance appears to havebeen made before the service of notice under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and even the measures adopted since have not yet proved entirely successful. In January, I made the following report, which was accepted by the Council and forwarded to the Local Government Board. Extract from Reports, pp. 150, 151, 152. A letter having been received from the Local Government Board, enclosing a communication from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor, and asking for the observations of the Council thereon, I beg to submit the following facts for your consideration:— On the 6th April, 1894, a report was received from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor, containing a list of some 2,223 defects alleged to exist in 596 houses in certain streets in the Borough. As stated in my report, dated 2nd May, 1894, the list of 2,223 defects required to be largely discounted for various rea sonssuch as 460 houses without dust-bins, 300 defects which the Inspectorsreported could not be discovered at all, and several houses mentioned in the report which had either disappeared or else had never existed, besides a number of other matters which were of a trivial character, or which did not come under the nuisance definitions contained in sec. 91 of the Public Health Act, 1875. On the 18th July, 1895, a further report was received giving a second list of defects alleged to exist in the same houses previously reported on. The numbers of defects mentioned in the second report (1,350) are considerably less than those given in the first report, and are also dissimilar in character. In no single case does the description given of any house agree with that given of the same house in the first report, thus proving conclusively that the information given by the Mansion House Council in their first report had been thoroughly investigated, and such defects as constituted a nuisance had been effectually dealt with, and that the defects enumerated in the second report were such as had arisen in the interval. The fact that the 21 matters complained of were thoroughly investigated and dealt with by the Inspectors is fully borne out by the records made in their official journals, which show the locality of every house inspected, the nature of the defects found therein, the date notices were served to remedy these defects, and the names and addresses of the persons on whom such notices were served, and also entries to the effect that the work was satisfactorily carried out. These journals can be produced, and are a standing refutation to many of the statements made by the Mansion House Council. Such defects as are common to both reports can either be accounted for in the manner stated above, or else were of such a character as could not be dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health Act. It is worthy of note that although in the first report 460 houses were said to be without dust-bins, and in the second report 474 houses are said to be provided with " receptacles of a sort; " in only a single case (and that an empty house) does the inspector of the Mansion House Council appear to have found " Any accumulation or deposit which is a nuisance or injurious to health."—Vide 38 & 39 Victoria cap. 55 s. 91. With regard to the latter part of the letter of the Mansion House Council received from the Local Government Board, referring to the closing of certain houses in Poplar Street, Canning Town, it may be mentioned that upon the receipt of the first report, the premises Nos. 30, 32, 34, and 36, Poplar Street, were inspected, and notices (copies of which I submit herewith) to abate the nuisances which were found to exist, were served upon the owner on 10th May, 1894. These notices were complied with, and the work satisfactorily carried out. The description of these houses as given in the report of July, 1895, show that the defects then existing were not of a serious character. The premises were again visited by the district inspector in the early part of November last, when it was found that the houses had again got into a bad condition, and notices (copies of which I submit herewith) were served on 6th November, 1895, requiring the owner to remedy the defects. As the said owner failed to comply with the notices, I reported the matter to your Committee, and acting 22 upon instructions I laid informations in the police court with a view to getting the houses closed. These informations were set down for hearing on November 27th, when it transpired that the Mansion House Council had also laid informations in respect of the same houses, which were also set down for hearing on that day. It so happened that their cases were called first, and so they succeeded in forestalling me in closing the houses. The evidence of the witnesses for the Mansion House Council proved that the houses were in far worse condition than at the time when the second report was made. This can only be accounted for by assuming that the defects had arisen in the interval. The success of the Mansion House Council proves nothing which they so triumphantly assert in the closing part of their letter to the Local Government Board. But for the mere accident of their cases being called first, the houses would have been closed by the action of the Corporation ; and that we have not been remiss in enforcing the provisions of the Public Health Act is proved by the fact that in the year 1893 notices were served to abate 10,441 nuisances, and 25 public health summonses were issued. In the year 1894 notices were served to abate 10,811 nuisances, and 65 public health summonses were issued. In the year 1895 notices were served to abate an even greater number of nuisances, and 76 public health summonses were issued, one case only being dismissed through failure of evidence. In reply to the inquiry of the Local Government Board as to what action has been taken by the Council to enforce the provision of proper receptacles for ashes and house refuse, I beg to state that in June, 1887, the Council decided to make an experimental trial of the pail system for the collection of house refuse in a certain portion of their district. A circular intimating this fact and asking the co-operation of the inhabitants in carrying the scheme into effect was distributed in the district indicated on the 16th June, 1887. On the 26th July, 1887, a printed notice was delivered at every house informing the occupiers that the new system of dust collection would commence on the 4th 23 of August, 1887, and asking them to provide by that time a suitable pail or other receptacle capable of holding three or four days' dust, which would be removed twice weekly, the receptacle to be placed at the door for the dustmen to empty into the cart. On the 1st September, 1887, another notice was delivered at every house in the Borough informing the occupiers that the experimental trial of the pail system of dust collection having proved successful, the Council were desirous of extending it throughout the Borough, and again asking them to provide the necessary receptacles, and to give their hearty co-operation in carrying out the scheme, and informing them of the date on which the collection in their particular district would commence. In September, 1889, a further notice was delivered to every house in the Borough, to the effect that, under the provisions of the West Ham Corporation (Improvements) Act, 1888, sec. 71, the Council had decided that in future there must be provided a pail or other suitable receptacle for ashes and house refuse to be placed at the door for the dustmen to empty into the cart, and that the men would call twice in each week on certain indicated days for the collection of the same. In May, 1895, in consequence of an alteration of the days of collection, a notice was delivered to the occupier of every house to the effect that under the provisions of the bye-laws made by the Council under section 26 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, the occupier of every house or premises was required to place the pail, or other receptacle for house refuse, outside the front of the house in a position convenient for removal by the dustmen twice in each week on such days as were specified in the notice. The notice also contained the penalty clause for offences against the bye-law. Two dust inspectors are constantly employed to see that the provisions of the bye-law are effectively carried out. SUMMARY OF THE ABOVE. 16th June, 1887.—Notice to occupiers of intention to carry out experimental trial by pail system of dust collestion. 26th July, 1887.—Notice of date for commencement of trial. 24 1st September, 1887.—Notice to occupiers of success of the trial and of date when pail system would be extended to whole Borough. 1888.—West Ham Corporation (Improvements) Act passed, giving power to Council to require use of pails or other suitable receptacles in place of dust bins. September, 1889.- Notice under the above Act served on the occupier of each house in Borough. 29th December, 1892.-Bye-law under section 26 of the Public Health Acts Amendment. Act, requiring occupiers to place pails outside front of house allowed by Local Government Board. May, 1895.-Notice under above bye-law served on each occupier. Factory and Workshops Acts.—Under the Act of 1895 not only are Laundries brought specially under the care of the Medical Officer of Health, but the Sanitary Authority is required to exercise a watchful supervision of Workshops, i.e., all places (with certain exceptions) where persons are employed for the purpose of trade or manufacture without the aid of steam or mechanical power, and in addition it is implied that the sanitary surroundings of outworkers, i.e., persons taking work to be completed at their own homes, should receive the constant attention of sanitary officials. During the year a considerable amount of work in this respect has been done by your staff, as is seen in the Table given below, but it has been at the expense of useful labour in other directions. Most of the largest English towns have appointed special Inspectors for this duty, and if the provisions of the Act are to be carried out systematically, as they should be in West Ham, I must recommend the Council to adopt the same course. 25 Business.

Most of the offenders discovered last year were cautioned by your Council, as a universal ignorance of the provisions of the Act appeared to prevail among shopkeepers. Business. Shops visited.

Plans were submitted and passed during the year for the erection or re-building of six bakehouses. In 13 cases limewashing was ordered, and in one case a bakehouse was closed by the Stipendiary as being sanitarily unfit for use and occupation as a bakehouse. Slaughter Houses—Fortunately, in the Southern Division only 4 slaughter Houses are licensed, while there are 27 in the Northern Division. None of these gave rise to complaint, a fact probably due to the slight use which is made of most of them; indeed, the Inspector often finds them not in use at the time of his visit. The ease with which meat can be brought into West Ham from Smithfield safeguards the Borough in two ways, in lessening the number and size of the animals slaughtered in the private slaughter 27 houses, and also in ensuring the regular and systematic examination of the carcases, which can only be carried out in public abattoirs. Oneyearly license was granted and 18 renewals to expire 25th March, 1897. Common Lodging Houses—The Common Lodging Houses (11 in the north and 3 in the south) received regular and frequent visitation during the year. No flagrant breach of bye-laws was discovered, though 10 were cleansed as a direct result of the Inspector's visit. Application was made for the registration of a Keeper at a common lodging house at 21, East Street, but, on my recommendation, was not granted by the Council, the lodging house being old and unsuitable. Offensive Trades.—West Ham has so long been the happy hunting ground of offensive trades that, in spite of the rapid growth of dwelling-houses, applicants for permission to establish these trades are still not infrequent, the applicants feeling, doubtless, that one more or less will make no appreciable difference. Three such applications were considered during the year. In two cases, for permission to establish fish skin dressing, in Beckton Road and Livingstone Road respectively, the applications were refused. The third case, for permission to carry on bone-boiling in Wycliffe Road,, was refused in March, but granted after a visit by your Public Health Committee in May. In this case the business had previously been carried on in the same premises, but had lapsed from non-user during several years. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order.—During the year the following milkshops were added to the register:— 117, Godwin Road; 122, Balaam Street; 2, Church Street, Plaistow ; 71, Idmiston Road; 2, Queen's Road, Custom House ; 20, Huntingdon Street; 59, Forest Street; 18, Star Lane. 28 Seven cases of infectious disease occurred on the premises of milk sellers, all being cases of scarlet fever. In five cases the infected person was removed to hospital, in one the business was suspended, and in one the business was temporarily removed to another house until after disinfection of the premises. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Margarine Act — Under these Acts 207 samples were taken for analysis, and 23 returned as adulterated. Particulars are given below, and the results of prosecution will be found in the Appendix. Number of Samples taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Article. Genuine. Adulterated. Total.

The Municipal collection was started at Lady-day in the Southern Division of the Borough, and at Midsummer in the Northern Division. The staff employed consist at present of two dust foremen and 46 men, who require the exclusive daily use of 31 horses, 16 carts, and 14 four-wheel vans. No break in the continuity of collection occurred either in Northern or Southern Division, and very few complaints reached my office during the year, these chiefly referring to non-collection on Bank Holidays. By the experience of working I am confirmed in the opinion I expressed to the Committee early in the year as to the superiority of -the two-wheeled vehicle over the four-wheeled van. During the year 23,447 loads were collected:— No. of Loads. Average Daily Collection.

I am, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Town Hall, Medical Officer of Health. August, 1897. 31 APPENDIX. ISOLATION OF SMALL-POX. The question as to the ability and advisability of the Council undertaking to provide accommodation for the reception and treatment in the Dagenham Hospital of cases of small-pox occurring in sanitary districts outside the County Borough of West Ham, was referred by the Council to me for consideration and report, and I herewith submit a memorandum on the subject. The question, which had been informally mooted some time since, was recently brought definitely before the Council by written applications from the following local authorities—Leyton Urban District Council, East Ham Urban District Council, Romford Urban District Council, Romford Rural District Council, Ilford Urban District Council, Woodford Urban District Council, and Barking Urban District Council, asking the Town Council whether they would be prepared to enter into agreement to receive and treat small-pox cases from these localities, and if so upon what terms. The Hospital to be built at Dagenham as at present planned will consist of permanent brick structures, including an administrative block of two storeys large enough to serve a staff capable of treating 44 patients, a one-storey pavilion of two wards each having 10 beds, an isolation pavilion with four beds, making 24 beds in all, together with lodge, laundry, and other necessary offices. There is in addition a Humphry's iron and wood ward for 12 beds, now full of hospital stores, at Plaistow; but capable of being re-erected at Dagenham. This would give the Council an immediate supply of 36 beds for the treatment of small-pox. 32 At my request the Town Clerk has kindly obtained particulars of the incidence of small-pox and population from the districts above referred to, and I am also obliged to Dr. Thresh, Medical Officer of Health to the Essex County Council, for a Table of notifications during the past three years. I have tabulated below the chief particulars thus obtained, distributing the cases to their several districts, and also placing the totals for the Essex districts side by side with those of West Ham, so that the totals for West Ham and for the extra-municipal districts can be easily compared and added. Notification of infectious diseases only came into force in 1889, but it is highly probable that the cases allotted to previous years are correct. Table II. shows the monthly notifications of small-pox in the Essex districts round West Ham. 33 TABLE I. District:— County Borough of West Ham. Total for South West Essex. Leyton. East Ham.

It is obvious that with the number of beds at the proposed Dagenham Hospital it would be quite impossible to treat so many cases in one month, and if West Ham undertook to provide accommodation for other districts with its existing number of beds, it could only carry out that undertaking by neglecting to isolate cases occurring in the Borough. As a matter of Public Health Policy, however, it is, in my opinion, extremely desirable if possible to endeavour in some way to arrange that our Dagenham Hospital shall be used by the outlying districts for all their cases of small-pox; in the first place, because the Council is undertaking to accommodate pauper cases occurring in the West Ham Union in order to complete the Fever Hospital at Plaistow ; but, secondly and chiefly, because cases occurring in these districts, especially those occurring in Leyton and East Ham, are almost as great a danger to the Borough as if they occurred in West Ham itself; thirdly, as will be seen from Table I., the hospital will, for several years running, be scarcely used at all, while at the same time it must ever be maintained in a state of efficiency and readiness to receive cases. To meet the probable call upon the hospital resources under these circumstances, it would be necessary to duplicate the proposed accommodation either by raising the Pavilion to another storey or erecting a second Pavilion similar to that already proposed. While it is a debatable question whether or not West Ham would be justified in thus catering for cases at a remunerative fee from the outlying districts in its own defence on the same grounds and in the same way that the Metropolitan Asylums Board are at present receiving West Ham cases, such a course would entail expense not lightly to be entered upon. It is probable, however, that the outlying districts would be willing, in order to save the increased expenses of each providing its own accommodation, to pay to West Ham a yearly sum towards the 36 maintenance of the Dagenham Hospital, together with a fee for the reception and treatment of each case. As a provisional proposal of this kind, I suggest that each district might pay to the Borough an annual sum of £1 per 1,000 of its estimated population, and £2 2s. per week per case sent in. This latter fee is the price at present paid by the Council to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and is the lowest charge estimated by that Board, after careful investigation, to cover the reception and treatment of cases of small-pox without including any sum for establishment maintenance. The estimated population of the outlying districts referred to is about 190,000, which would provide a yearly sum of £190 towards the maintenance of the hospital both during user and non-user, and the Borough would derive an indirect benefit by ensuring the prompt removal of a dangerous infectious disease from its immediate neighbourhood, without suffering pecuniary loss from the suggested enlargement of the hospital. The Council could, and doubtless would, receive cases into the Dagenham Hospital from other sanitary districts so long as the accommodation allowed, (due regard being had to the necessities of the Borough ; but I feel sure such an uncertain position would not commend itself to the Sanitary Authorities concerned; and, therefore, unless some arrangement, say for seven or more years, on the lines above suggested, be made, it would be impracticable and unwise for the Council to enter into an agreement to provide hospital accommodation for cases of small-pox occurring outside the Borough.
