PLON 23 77. PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, To 31st December, 1921. Presented 27th July, 1922. REPORT, For the Year ended 31st December, 1921, OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PORT OP LONDON BY WILLOUGHBY MASON WILLOUGHBY, B.A., M.D., B.C., Cantab., D.P.H. Camb., Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. LONDAN. Printed by Charles Skipper & east, 49, Great Tower Street, E.C. 3. BOWATER, Locum Tenens. BADDELEY, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 27th day of July, 1922. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Port to the 31st December, 1921; which was read. Ordered, That the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. WE, whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation, as the Port of London Sanitary Authority, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Willoughby Mason Willoughby, the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London, for the year ended the 31st December, 1921, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work done in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. The Report records steady work in the detection of imported infectious epidemic diseases and of developments in the destruction of rats on shipboard and in the docks, with which the extermination of Plague is so closely associated. In this connection special notice is drawn to the attention which is now given by shipowners to the fumigation of their vessels, not only in home ports but abroad, before taking in cargo, and it is hoped that it will shortly be apparent that the practice is of sound economic value, apart from the safeguard it affords the public from the point of view of Plague. A progressive improvement is observed in the inspection of food imports and in the general sanitary condition of the Port, the work of food inspection especially having increased since the opening of the new King George V. Dock. 2 An Account of Receipts and Expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary Authority for the year ended the 31st March, 1922, is appended, in accordance with the Order of your Honourable Court, for the information of the Court. All which we submit to the judgment of this Honourable Court. Dated this thirteenth day of July, 1922. E. L. J. Durant. Thos. Goldney. C. S. Giddins. W. Fortescue. J. G. Howell. Thomas Ellis. Chas.

TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1921. Medical Inspection.—The total number of vessels medically inspected during the year was 751, and the total number of cases of illness reported to your Medical Officers was 549, of which number 48 cases were removed to Denton Hospital. Aliens.—Aliens arriving in the Port have been found to be clean, healthy and louse-free to a degree which compares very favourably with conditions which existed among them in former times. Infectious Disease.—There are few outstanding features in the record of infectious disease. The customary careful examination of the entering ships has been maintained, and many of the ships showed cause for special watch during their stay in the Port by reason of illness which had occurred during the voyage. A point which is possibly of some importance to agriculture emerged in connection with bone meal: this material was in one case proved to contain the spores of Anthrax, and was the probable origin of the disease in and death of a labourer. No case of the major infectious diseases—Plague, Cholera, Small-pox or Typhus —has arrived in the Port. The notice of masters of vessels and others has been called generally to the provisions of the Port Sanitary Authorities' (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, by means of a handbill. (See page 38.) The total number of disinfections on account of Infectious Disease was 130. Rats.—There is a largely increased list of arriving ships which have been fumigated for the destruction of rats at various Ports. Sulphur Dioxide is seen to be the fumigant in greatest use. No Plague-infected rat has been found in the Port during the year. Food Inspection.—The total approximate weight of unsound food condemned as unfit for human food was 2,616 tons. Details are given of the methods employed in the disposal of this quantity. Sanitary Inspection.—The total number of visits of inspection was 25,992, this number being somewhat below the average taken over ten years ending 31st December last. Canal Boats.—The Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended to this Report. TABLE 1.—MEDICAL INSPECTION—GRA\ESEND. From 1st January to 31st December, 1921. Jan.

"Kamo Maru," from Kobe for London, Japanese vessel, 146 crew and 19 passengers, arrived in the Port of London on the 20th January. It was reported that a case of illness had been landed at Colombo, which on post-mortem and bacteriological examination was determined to be Plague. The ship was at Kobe 30th Nov., 1920 Shanghai 6th Dec., ,, Hong Kong 10th Dec., ,, Singapore 16th Dec., ,, Penang 18th Dec., ,, Colombo 24th Dec., ,, Suez 5th Jan., 1921 Port Said 6th Jan., ,, Marseilles 13th Jan., ,, Gravesend 20th Jan., ,, Case.—Tattori Tokujiro, washerman (Stewards' Department) was taken ill four days out from Singapore on the 20th December. He presented Fever and an Inguinal Bubo, was landed at Colombo on the 23rd, and died on the 24th December. The patient had spent a night ashore at Singapore—the question of the presence of a rat infection on the ship was therefore of importance in determining how the ship should be dealt with. In the presence of a rat mortality a case of Plague would hardly be considered to have been contracted ashore. Eat Infection.—Altogether about 20 dead rats were found prior to arrival at Colombo. 50 or 60 are stated to have been caught in traps. After leaving Shanghai five dead rats were found in the quarters of the stewards—in these quarters and amongst the stewards the patient was berthed. After leaving Colombo it was stated that poison had been put down freely, but further dead rats were not found. Infected Quarters.—These constituted a space out of the upper 'tween deck of Nos. 3 and 4 holds on the starboard side. They formed the stewards' quarters for about 30 men, being approached by a companion way between the hatches of Nos. 3 and 4 holds. At the bottom of the companion way was a space from which the berthing accommodation opened. This space was a constant depository for rice in use for the crew's food and also contained a rat-holed food locker. As has been stated, dead rats were found in the stewards' quarters. The berth occupied by the case of Plague was an upper bunk close to the doorway leading to the space appropriated to rice storage. Ample food and moisture in addition was found on the deck in connection with refuse from the galley situated immediately in front of No. 3 hold. 9 Cargo.—The cargo for London contained practically no foodstuffs. 15,000 bags of flour were taken on at Shanghai and stored in No. 1 hold for landing at Port Said. 1,500 bags of rice from Hong Kong for Port Said were stored in No. 2 hatch. 2,830 bags of hemp seed for Marseilles were stored in No. 1 and No. 5 holds. This constituted nearly all the rat attractive material on the ship. Precautions Taken on the Ship.—At Colombo the infected quarters were washed down with carbolic solution; at Suez the whole of the living quarters of the ship were fumigated and their textile contents removed for steam disinfection. At Marseilles the holds and quarters were fumigated—there was a delivery pipe in each hold and the duration of pumping Sulphur Dioxide was five hours; about three hours more were allowed for diffusion, i.e., a disinfestation of eight hours in all. After landing material at Port Said the ship was about half full of cargo, and therefore the fumigation at Marseilles, which took place prior to the landing of the cargo, may have been more effective than has been supposed in former Marseilles fumigations. Precautions Taken at Gravesend.—The cargo was discharged into barges under the usual precautions while the ship lay in the River. This cargo consisted largely of boxed, cased and barrelled goods. It appeared that the vast bulk of the London cargo needed no detention; certain articles, however, were detained for a fortnight. The amount of Antwerp cargo was very small. This was discharged in London, so that the whole ship could be placed under fumigation when empty. I am inclined to think that the risk of infection from this ship was small, but in the absence of certainty, pending the discharge of the cargo and the estimation of the residual infection, I considered it reasonably necessary to detain the ship at Gravesend. Notifications to various Medical Officers of Health:— Passengers 9 Crew - Workmen, &c. 7 s.s. "Foyle" arrived from Shanghai on the 29th April. On the 22nd March an apprentice complained of swelling in the groin which he considered to be a rupture, and for this he was treated with a truss. The swelling became more painful and was recognised as a Bubo. At Colombo and Perim the Port Surgeons regarded it as a Venereal Bubo, but the patient denied venereal disease although he had exposed himself to the risk of contracting this disease in Hong Kong on February 26th. Patient was landed at Suez as a case suspicious of Plague on April 12th. At no time was the patient ill, nor was there any rise of temperature. No dead rats were found on the ship, and no other case of illness occurred. The ship carried a cargo of powder, shell and rubber. The Boarding Medical Officer at Gravesend had little doubt that the case was one of Venereal Bubo; the rat condition was watched. The quarters on the ship were fumigated, and all bedding passed through steam disinfector. s.s. "Karmala" arrived from Kobe on the 28th April. On the 27th March a bedroom steward was taken ill with headache, shivering and vomiting; temperature 103, pulse 90. On the 1st April patient's left tonsil and left side of neck were much swollen and inflamed. He was removed to hospital at Colombo on the 2nd April, and a report received at Suez stated that he had died from Plague. The infected quarters of the vessel were disinfected, and bedding and clothing taken ashore and stoved. On arrival at Gravesend, the vessel was visited by your Medical Officer; no sign or history of rat mortality was discovered. The ship went to dock and was dealt with as being under suspicion of a rat infection. The names and addresses of passengers, 146, and crew, 67, were taken and notified to the various Medical Officers of Health. s.s. "Yangtse" (French) arrived on the 21st July from Dairen, Dalny. On the 27th May an Asiatic fireman was observed to be sick, at Saigon. He was seen by the French Port Authority there and removed to hospital as suspected Plague. Patient had a groin Bubo, but no fever. The case was kept in hospital, and a bacteriological examination made, which was positive. It was a mild case. Patient's quarters were close to. a hold, but away from stores. He had been ashore at Saigon between May 13th and 27th, 1921. 10 The crew were inoculated with Plague serum, the crew's quarters were disinfected, and the Clayton apparatus was used for the holds, &c. No dead rats were found. Medical surveillance was maintained until the 4th June, when the vessel left for Port Said. C02 fumigation had been done at Shanghai when the vessel was empty, on the 12th April, only five dead rats were discovered. 8,000 tons of wheat were put on board at Dalny at the end of April. (Dalny Bill of Health clean). No rats were seen on board after the Shanghai fumigation, and examination at Gravesend failed to detect any traces of rats. The crew were all well on inspection at Gravesend, and the vessel was allowed to proceed to dock. The crew stood by the ship under observation. No further suspicion of Plague was aroused. s.s. "Sabor" arrived from Rio Grande do Sul on the 27th August. On the 24th July a fireman become ill with fever and swelling in left groin. He was isolated at once. On the 31st July a trimmer was taken ill with fever, apathy, weak pulse and swellings in both groins. On arrival at Rotterdam, on the 7th August, both cases were landed as suspected Plague. Bacteriological investigations were said to have been made at St. Vincent and Eotterdam, but no reports had been received on the ship. On arrival at Gravesend, the crew were inspected and their names and addresses taken, verified and notified on to the various Medical Officers of Health. Cargo on board consisted of wet hides, coffee, tobacco, and meat in cases. There were no cereals. Part cargo was discharged at Eotterdam and Hamburg. 500 tons for London remained on board. The vessel was fumigated at Hampton Eoads, September, 1920, on the outward voyage. At Santos, on the homeward voyage, nine hours Claytonising of all holds, living quarters and stores was done, but no rats were seen or found dead. At Eotterdam the vessel discharged in quarantine. At Hamburg 24 hours treatment with the Nocht-Giemsa (Carbon Monoxide) process was given, and the quarters were sulphured. Six dead rats were found in the holds and examined bacteriologically; they were free from Plague. The ship thereafter was alongside the wharf at Hamburg without restriction. The vessel was allowed to proceed to the Victoria Dock to be kept under strict observation. The vessel afterwards sailed for Newport, Mon., the Medical Officer of Health there being informed of the circumstances. s.s. "City of Milan" arrived from Calcutta on the 9th August. The second cook was ill with a swelling in the groin and was removed to Denton Hospital, as a suspicious case. Patient was found to be suffering from septic femoral gland, and was discharged op the 15th August. s.s. "Omar" arrived from Brisbane on the 4th October. On the 16th September the sixth engineer was taken ill with enlarged gland and fever. Patient had been unwell for some time with small abscesses in right hand and buttock. Patient was landed at Suez on the 18th September, as a case suspicious of Plague. The whole of firemen's and engineers' quarters were disinfected at Suez. Subsequent information was negative as regards Plague. On arrival at Gravesend the vessel was found to be infested with rats, and was fumigated in dock. TABLE V.—Small-pox. Date. 1921.

On the 9th August the death of a dock labourer who had been employed in the discharge of a ship in Tilbury Dock was reported as suspected Anthrax. The man complained of inflammation on his neck on the 3rd August, and had been engaged in the holds of a ship on the 26th, 27th and 28th July, in the discharge of bone meal. An Inspector, on enquiry, found the animal products on the ship suspected of the origin of the disease, to consist of dry salted sheep, lamb, goat and cow skins, and of some 3,000 bags of bone meal. The whole of these products were delivered from Tilbury Dock, with the exception of a few overlooked bags of bone meal, so that an extensive enquiry outside the Port Sanitary District appeared to be necessitated in order to arrive at the source of the Anthrax; all the information available was passed on to the Ministry of Health. The hides appeared to be the likely, and the bone meal a possible source of infection. The few bags of bone meal remaining in dock were sampled, and the samples sent to the Ministry of Health; these were found to contain Anthrax spores. There is every inherent possibility of bone meal retaining infection if made from infected material, but I have not hitherto noticed any comment on bone meal as a source of Anthrax, and it would appear to be of great importance, having regard to the unexplained infections which crop up from time to time in the country, that bone meal has now been shown to be a source of the disease. 24 TABLE XXII.

The Regulations issued by the Local Government Board (now the Ministry of Health) under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, were carried out in the Port of London, and resulted in 2,616 tons, 17 cwts. 0 qrs. 16 lbs. of Unsound Food being destroyed or disposed of in such a manner as to prevent its being used for human consumption. Exceptions are shown in the disposal of some of the goods for the manufacture of confectionery, distillation and by exportation. The goods for the manufacture of confectionery were condensed milk which had either undergone a yeast fermentation or had been returned to this country owing to caramelisation and discolouration. The deleterious qualities were removed in the process of re-manufacture, and thus the use of a considerable quantity of valuable food material was retained. The goods for distillation consist usually of dried fruits, e.q., dates, prunes, raisins and sultanas. The goods were disposed of as follows, only those which could not be used tor some useful purpose being actually destroyed:— Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Lbs.

During the year applications were received from Importers to be allowed to remove various foodstuffs from the District of the Port of London without examination by your officers, on the understanding that the goods would be examined and dealt with under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which the goods were removed. The permission asked for was given in respect of the following foodstuffs:— For removal to the City of London:— 569 pig carcases. 1,206 cases dates. 7,560 bags ox-tongues. For removal to the Borough of Bermondsey:— 598 cases tinned pears. 1,458 „ ox-tongues. 4,450 „ condensed milk. 25 barrels pig-tongues. 435 cases eggs. 97 cwts. 2 qrs. 10 lbs. and 416 bags wheat For removal to the Borough of Finsbury:— 7,960 bags and 1,375 cases ox-tongues. For removal to the Borough of Holborn:— . 300 boxes prunes. For removal to the Borough of Southwark:— 22 cases ox-tongues. 10,178 boxes butter. For removal to the Borough of Hackney:— 1,822 cases tinned meats. For removal to the Borough of Poplar:— .1,152 bags flour. For removal to the Borough of Islington:— 185 cases tinned cocoa and milk. 1,235 „ „ cherries. 67 ,, „ apples. On the 23rd September a vessel arrived from New York having on board 25 barrels of pig-tongues in pickle. On examination some of the barrels were found to be " blown " and the contents unfit for human consumption. The goods were placed under detention and a communication sent to the consignees with a view to the goods being sorted before removal from the dock, and an inspection was made by one of your Food Inspectors in company with a representative of the consignees. An application was made by the consignees to be allowed to remove the whole of the goods to their own warehouse within the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey, and on receipt of an intimation from the Medical Officer of Health for that district that he was agreeable to the suggested arrangement, the application was sanctioned. This is an illustration of a type of work which is done in the Port which would not usually appear in the Reports. The disclosure of the state of the tongues is, however, the work of a Port Sanitary Inspector, and, of course, in this, as in other similar instances, the nature of the consignment is explained to the Medical Officer of Health of the district who consents to receive it. In this case the consignees were anxious to obtain the casks, which would have been a matter of difficulty to both the Port Sanitary Authority and the traders, were disposal of the contents contemplated in the Port. 46 TABLE XXX.—General Summary, and Analysis, of the Sanitary Inspections of Vessels, &c., in the Port of London, for the year ended 31st December, 1921.

CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority during the year ended 31st December, 1921. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks —as a "canal," for the purposes of the Act, "includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or is not within the ebb or flow of the tide. The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the right bank- From Teddington downwards:—Wandsworth Creek (River Wan die). Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Docks. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (Eiver Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). The entrance to the Gravesend Canal. Cliffe Creek. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Part of the River Medway, and of the Swale. On the left bank— From Teddington downwards :— The entrance to the River Brent. Hammersmith Creek. Chelsea Dock. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Bow Creek (River Lea). Barking Creek (River Roding). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). Mucking Creek. Thames Haven. Hole Haven. Havengore Creek. River Roach as far as Rochford. RIVER. The whole of this area is divided into three districts known as Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows:— Upper District.—Teddington to Greenwich Inspector Gray, 91/. per annum. Middle District.—Greenwich to Erith Ditto. Lower District.—Erith to seaward limits of the Inspector Berry, 220/. per annum. Port of London (including part of the River Medway). The Docks are divided into four districts known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend District. Central District.— West India Dock Inspector Rolfe, 250/. per annum. South West India Dock Poplar Dock Millwall Dock Eastern District.— -Royal Victoria Dock Inspector Burr, 250/. per annum. East India Dock Royal Albert Dock Inspector Lambe, 250/. per annum. King George V. Dock 51 Western District.— London Dock Inspector Hopkins, 2501, per annum. St. Katherine's Dock Eegent's Dock Surrey Commercial Dock Inspector Elward, 240/. per annum. Gravesend District- Tilbury Dock Inspector Massie, 280/. per annum. Left Shore, from Purfleet down. Right Shore, from Erith down (2) The total number of inspections for the year was 97, representing a net number of 65 boats. The remainder, 32, represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 18 (inspected on 34 occasions, or 18.55 per cent. of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous five years being 21.73 cent.). ???cs In addition to the above, two boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin doors locked, there being no persons on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of boats inspected. (3) With reference to the various infringements of the Act:— Unregistered Boats.
