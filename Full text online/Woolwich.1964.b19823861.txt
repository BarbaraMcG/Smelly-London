AC. 7372 w0064 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1964 BY T. STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1964 by T. Standring,M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H.,M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health PREFACE HEALTH REPORT FOR THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH, 1964 Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 64th and last Annual Report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. The publication of this Report had, of necessity, to be delayed due to the reorganisation of London Local Government. Turing the whole of the year 1964 detailed arrangements were being made for the merging of the Local Authority Health and Welfare Services into one new Department so that there would be no disruption of the local services. The merging of the Local Authority Health and Welfare Services Into a combined Health and Welfare Department of the new Borough of Greenwich has been widely welcomed as giving a wonderful opportunity to expand this work and, at the same time to preserve the best of the old foundations well and truly laid by the former Authorities, Before closing the Preface to my last Report I should like briefly to refer to the chief events in 1964 so far as the old Woolwich area is concerned. The infant death rate for the Borough of Woolwich was for the second year, the lowest on record at 16.9. a similar figure to that for the year 1960. It is indeed gratifying to report that during the year there were only three deaths attributable to tuberculosis. This is an astonishing fact which even 20 years ago would have been thought Impossible to achieve. This remarkable reduction is the result of continuous efforts over many years by the Chest Physicians; the greatly improved methods of detecting chest disease; the better utilization of the preventive services; the success of the B.C.G. vaccination scheme; and, of course, the modern drugs available. One disturbing aspect of the Borough's statistics continues to be the increasing number of deaths from cancer, totalling 366 in the year 1964. This is by far the highest number on record for the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich, and an increase of 39 on the previous year. 99 of the cancer deaths were from carcinoma of the lung or bronchus. I can only again stress the seriousness of smoking and the need for more publicity and a greater awareness of 2 the risks involved amongst the general public. The impetus of recent years in the rapid expansion of the Health Services was maintained in 1964, advances being made in many directions. An important start was made during 1964 in the administration of the new Offices and Shops Act, which is designed to raise the general working conditions in these premises. Altogether 1,992 premises were registered during the year and of these 302 received an initial detailed inspection. In the premises registered at the end of the year over 10,000 persons were employed. Generally, local offices are reasonably satisfactory, although in a small minority their conditions left much to be desired. The general standard has much improved in recent years due to a large increase in new office building. With regard to the conditions in shop premises, there are still several shops, particularly in older parts of the Borough, which are below the minimum standard and strenuous efforts are being made to bring about an early improvement. During 1964, despite the imminent transfer of functions to the new Borough requiring detailed planning, rapid strides were nevertheless made in the Council's Clean Air Programme. In addition, the services for the elderly were being constantly expanded. Details of this work are contained in the body of the Report. Woolwich can look back with pride on its achievements in health and welfare since its formation in 1900. The Borough has been fortunate in always having an enlightened and progressive Council, and it has been my honour and privilege to serve them for the last 24 years. This Report would be most incomplete if I did not record my grateful thanks to the members and to the staff, both of my own and other Departments, for their unfailing support and help.

WATER SUPPLY By the end of the year under review, it was estimated that the number of occupied dwellings in the Borough totalled 46,172. The domestic water supply to all the dwellings in the area is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board, Bacteriological and chemical tests, including those for radioactivity, are carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board and the results of the various tests are forwarded to the Council at regular intervals. The water in this area is not subject to plumbo-solvent action. 14 No complaints were received during the year as to quantity or quality of the water. Samples of water taken for bacteriological examination throughout the course of the year from the seven wells still in use in the Borough proved the water to be satisfactory. Well water is used at the Council's swimming baths at Woolwich and Plumstead, as well as for industrial and firefighting purposes. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS SHOPS The Council have Byelaws governing the cleanliness of haidressers and barbers shops and equipment used therein.

During the year twelve inspections were carried out and reports submitted to the Town Clerk. 15 LICENSING ACT, 1961 - APPLICATIONS FOR CLUB REGISTRATION Applications for Club registration under the provisions of the Licensing Act are dealt with at the local Magistrate's Court. However, before the applications are considered by the Magistrate copies are forwarded to the Council for observation. Visits are made to the premises requiring registration by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the minimum requirements as a Public Health and Food and Drugs Authority are met. Reports were made in respect of 23 club premises during the year. PIGEON NUISANCE The Health Department continued to take such measures as were possible to reduce the nuisance from pigeons in the Borough, and the total number of birds destroyed by the end of the year was 668. The main method is by trapping, using specially designed traps for the purpose, and in addition to the birds destroyed a considerable number of pigeon eggs were collected and also destroyed. OUTWORKERS The houses of persons employed on outwork are periodically Inspected by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that working conditions and cleanliness are satisfactory, and the latest returns received from employers of outworkers indicate that the number of persons employed as outworkers totalled 140.

The notices were complied with in each case. Following informal action a further 62 defective dustbins were replaced by new ones. DRAINAGE The Public Health Inspectors supervised the necessary work of cleansing, repair or reconstruction of the 387 drainage defects found during the year by the Department's staff. Smoke tests or colour tests were applied on 33 private or combined drains suspected of being defective. 23 drains were subsequently found to be defective ana the necessary repairs were carried out by the owners of the premises. Two defective drains found on test to be no longer in use, were subsequently sealed off by the Health Department's staff. 18 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS AND PADDLING POOLS Sampling of water from the Council's swimming baths is carried out as a matter of routine throughout the year and testing for pH reaction and chlorine content is undertaken by the Health Department.

Applications from tenants for Certificates as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking Nil 12. Certificates Issued to tenants as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking Nil RODENT CONTROL During the year 1,148 complaints of rats, and 677 of mice, were received and, in addition to investigating these complaints, systematic inspection under the 'block control' system was continued. In all 5,687 premises were inspected, and of this total 3,761 premises were under the 'block control' scheme. Seven 'block control' schemes were carried out in the course of the year. The number of premises, including 158 business or industrial premises, treated for rats or mice totalled 1,825. Rodent control treatments are carried out by the Council free of charge in all private dwellings; for industrial and business premises a charge is made. Where it is found that defects of a structural nature are causing or aggravating an infestation of rodents the remedy is taken up with the owner of the premises. Sixteen drains suspected as a cause of rat infestation were smoke tested by the Department's staff, and in nine cases the tests proved positive. The defective drains were subsequently repaired by the owners. Formal action to secure the remedy of the defects was not found to be necessary. For the third year running the poison Sodium Fluoracetamide was used for the control of rats in sewers. Due to the undoubted success of this poison over the 20 previous two years, it was considered necessary to bait only twice during the year instead of the usual four times a year. The results of the "takes" indicated that the rats in the sewers treated with Sodium Fluroacetamide had been to all intents and purposes, eliminated. RAG FLOCK There are three premises in the Borough registered under the provisions of the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 and one factory is licensed under the Act for the manufacture of rag flock. During the year four samples of rag flock were taken and submitted for analysis. All the samples tested passed the prescribed standards of cleanliness. CINEMAS A satisfactory standard of cleanliness was maintained in the sanitary conveniences of the various cinemas in the Borough. Inspections of the conveniences are carried out by the Public Health Inspectors at regular intervals. SHOPS ACT INSPECTIONS The administration of the Shops Act is divided between the County Council and Borough Council; the Borough being responsible for ventilation, sanitary accommodation, lighting, washing facilities, and facilities for employees to take meals. The number of inspections in connection with the Act made during the year was 1,055. As a result, 42 notices were served to secure the remedy of 97 defects found. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 Persons who sell Part II poisons, other than Registered Pharmacists, are required to be licensed by the Local Authority, and. at the end of the year 130 names were entered in the Council's Poison List. 21 The premises from which Part II poisons are sold are visited regularly throughout the year and licences are renewed annually. NOISE ABATEMENT The Report of the Wilson Committee (the Committee on the Problem of Noise) which deals with noise-its effects, the legal aspects and various causes of noise-transport, industrial, entertainment, advertising, agricultural-has defined noise as "sound which is undesired by the recipient" and categorically states that "there is no doubt that noise affects health". The Report recommends that "Local Authorities and the Courts should be encouraged to deal with noise nuisance cases as quickly as possible". In order to alleviate possible distress from noise, complaints of this nature are dealt with by this Department as soon as practicable, even though the investigation often involves visits during weekends, late evenings and early mornings. An example was a complaint received from a resident of a terraced house that a dance band was using the adjoining premises as a rehearsal hall. The Public Health Inspector visited the house during the following evening and the members of the band were advised to seek alternative accommodation where their playing was not likely to cause a nuisance. Machinery, particularly when used at night or during the early hours of the morning, often gives rise to complaints and a number of complaints involving machines and engines were investigated. Neighbours of a baker's shop alleged that stocks were delivered to the shop at about 5.00 a.m. and the resultant banging of doors and thoughtless handling of the goods meant the loss of sleep. The Public Health Inspector kept observation and was able to confirm a noise nuisance. The Proprietor was instructed to see that the van making the deliveries was unloaded quietly or, alternatively, arrange for the van to call at a more reasonable hour. No further complaints were received from these residents. A local transport garage was the subject of a similar complaint. Drivers arriving at the garage between 5.00 a.m.-6.00 a.m. raced the engines of their vehicles on cold mornings as a means of warming them and then left the motors running for a considerable period of time before driving away. The attention of the Management was drawn to the annoyance and appropriate notices were subsequently displayed in the garage by the Management warning their staff to refrain from creating undue noise, especially in the early hours of the morning. 22 A more serious nuisance investigated was that of a factory which opened up in most unsuitable premises immediately adjoining residential properties. The factory was engaged on wood machining of all kinds, involving the use of power-driven saws, planes, etc. Not only was the noise excessive, but the fire precautions and general layout for a factory of this type were entirely unsuitable. The District Surveyor and Factory Inspector were notified of the conditions under which the factory was operating, and following their intervention the business was closed down. All noise complaints,however, cannot be resolved as satisfactorily from the complainant's point of view as the foregoing cases. What constitutes a noise nuisance for some people is often unnoticed by others, as was illustrated by a resident who complained that students driving cars owned by a local driving school used the particular stretch of road outside his house to practice three-point turns. The Public Health Inspector sat in the complainant's living room the following Saturday and Sunday afternoons when it was alleged the noise nuisance, by virtue of the number of times this incident occurred, was at its peak. Although the engines of the cars involved were clearly audible they were no noisier than that of any average private car, and the Public Health Inspector was unable to satisfy himself of the existence of a noise nuisance. Nevertheless, a number of the other residents in the area were interviewed to obtain their reactions. The neighbours of the complainant interviewed, however, had no complaint to make on the presence of the cars in the road on the grounds of noise. An. approach was then made to the owner of the driving school, and he was advised of the complaint and requested to ask his instructors to take the pupils somewhere else to practice turns. The Proprietor denied that his cars caused any undue nuisance and was not prepared to discontinue using this particular stretch of road. The Police were also consulted for their views but could offer no assistance in the matter, and accordingly the complainant was advised of the powers conferred by the Noise Abatement Act, 1960 whereby any three or more persons aggrieved by a nuisance shall have recourse to the Court by way of private action. 23 Various other noise nuisances were investigated and concluded satisfactorily throughout the year, including noisy motor scooters, shop-fitters using power tools at weekends, and water pipes. The Health Committee considered a complaint from a resident alleging that a driver of an ice-cream van used loud speaker chimes outside the hours of 12 noon - 7.00 p.m. permitted by the Noise Abatement Act. Subject to the availability of satisfactory evidence the Committee authorised the institution of legal proceedings. It was not proved possible, however, to proceed with legal proceedings as the van driver concerned left the employment of the ice-cream company and also moved to an unknown address. WOODWORK AND OTHER PESTS Following complaints from residents that their premises were infested with various pests, the Public Health Inspectors made 585 visits to identify the insects and advise occupiers on methods of disinfestation. Where occupiers or owners request that the Council carry out the actual work of disinfestation on their behalf and it is undertaken by the Health Department's staff, the costs involved are recovered from the occupier or owner. During the course of the year, 39 houses were treated for woodworm, 3 premises for cockroaches, (2 of which were Council establishments), 2 premises for heavy fly infestations, and one for ants. Wild bees and wasps nesting in gardens, outbuildings or in air-bricks, etc. of residents' houses resulted in a number of complaints to the Department, and in all 33 wasps nests, and 11 wild bees nests were destroyed by the Department's staff using Dieldrin Powder. Charges made to the responsible persons for the work outlined above totalled £147.2.6. -24- OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAIIWAY PREMISES ACT, 1963 The administration of the Offices, Shops and RailwayPremises Act, 1963 was referred by the Council to the Health Committee. General Scope of the Act Provided that people are employed to work in the premises, the Act applies generally to all offices and shops, including catering establishments open to the public, wholesale establishments, and fuel storage premises; and to most railway buildings near the permanent way. The Act not only applies to rooms in shops and offices in which people work, but covers other parts of the premises occupied together with a shop or office for the purpose of the activities carried on there. Thus stairs, passages, landings, storerooms, entrances, exits and yards may be covered. Generally the Act also applies to parts of the buildings which are used by employees, such as lifts, stairways and halls, even if these 'common' parts are not included within the lease of the occupier of the premises to which the Act applies. While the Act has extensive coverage, certain kinds of premises, which might otherwise be within its scope are excluded. These are:- (1) Premises where only self-employed persons work. (To be within the scope of the Act there must be at least one person employed to work in the premises under a contract of service or apprenticeship. Such a contract may be written or oral, express or implied.) (2) Businesses where the only people employed are any of the following immediate relatives of the employer husband, wife, parent, grandparent, son, daughter, grandchild, brother or sister. (This exclusion, however, does not apply if 'the employer is a limited company). If any other person is employed to work in the premises the business' is covered by the Act. (3) Outworkers premises. (4) Premises where the sum of hours worked by all the employees is normally not more than 21 each week. -25- (5) Premises bdcupied solely by members of the Armed Forces. (6) Premises used for selling fish wholesale in docks. (7) Parts of mines below ground. (8) Mobile offices and mobile shops, (in effect the Act excludes premises used for temporary purposes, i.e. offices on building sites not in occupation more than six months). All persons employed to work in the premises, whatever their occupation, are given the same protection by the Act. The protection is not restricted to shop or clerical workers and certain railway workers who do their normal work outside buildings are deemed for this purpose to be inside the building from which their rork is controlled. Responsibility for Complying with the Act Generally speaking the occupier of premises is responsible for complying with the provisions of the Act, but some responsibilities are transferred to the owner in cases where the occupier's premises covered by the Act are held on lease and do not take up a whole building, or where the premises are contained in a building of which different parts are owned by different persons. General Requirements of the Act The Act is designed to protect employees in offices and shops in a similar manner to the protection enjoyed by employees in factories covered by the Factories Act, 1961. Other than fuel storage premises in the open air, the Act requires that all premises and furnishings, fittings and furniture must be kept in a clean state. The Act provides a standard to prohibit overcrowding, and provision has been made for ensuring the maintenance of a reasonable temperature in every room in which people are employed to work other than on short periods. Ventilation must be effective, and lighting must be suitable and sufficient. Regulations prescribe for adequate and suitable sanitary accommodation and for washing facilities. An adequate supply of drinking water must be provided, and arrangements made -26- for the storage of clothing not worn during working hours. Where employees have, during working hours, opportunities for sitting without detriment to their work, a sufficient number of conveniently accessible seats must be provided. Seats provided for sedentary workers must be of suitable design and construction and, unless the feet may be rested comfortably without their use, foot rests must also be provided. Suitable facilities must be provided for employees in shops to eat meals on the premises. All floors, passage stairs and steps must be soundly constructed, properly maintained and, as far as is reasonably practicable, kept free from obstruction and slippery substances. Substantial hand rails or hand holds must be provided on every staircase. All dangerous parts of machinery must be securely fenced, unless they are so placed or constructed as to be as safe as if they were fenced. No person under 18 years of age may clean any machinery if this exposes him to risk of injury from a working part from that or any other adjacent machinery. No person may work at any machine specified by the Minister of Labour as dangerous unless he has been fully instructed as to the dangers and precautions to be observed, and no person may be required in the course of his work to lift, carry or move a load so heavy as to be likely to cause him injury. A first-aid box or cupboard, containing only first-aid requisites, must be provided for the use of employees in all premises. Regulations have been made linking specific contents of first-aid boxes to the number of persons employed. Where there are more than 150 persons employed in premises at one time, one of the persons in charge of the first-aid box or cupboard must be trained in first-aid to a required standard. Fire Precautions. Such means of escape as are reasonably necessary must be provided in all premises, and regard must be paid in considering means of escape in the event of fire not only to the numbers of persons usually employed in the premises, but also to the number of other people that may reasonably be expected to be on the premises at any one time. During the hours when the building -27- is normally occupied, doors must not be locked and the contents of workrooms should be so arranged as to afford free passageway to a means of escape in case of fire. In premises where more than 20 persons are employed at any one time or premises where more than 10 people are employed at any one time on floors other than the ground floor, it is unlawful to employ anyone in them unless a certificate has been issued by the Fire Authority. EXEMPTIONS The Minister of Labour has power to exempt by order a class of premises from certain requirements of the Act when in his opinion it is unreasonable to require compliance because of special circumstances. The requirements in question are those relating to room space for employees, temperature, sanitary conveniences and washing facilities. As regards space and temperature an exemption order may relate to a class of rooms. An exemption under this scheme may be granted unconditionally or subject to conditions. If the authority enforcing are satisfied that compliance is not reasonably practicable they may exempt individual premises from the following requirements- room space for employees, temperature, sanitary conveniences, and running water for washing purposes. Where an application for exemption is made, a notice giving full particulars of the application must be kept posted in the premises for 14 days following the date on which the notice is posted. The notice must state that the employees may make written representation to the enforcing authority within the 14 day period. If an exemption is granted the certificate must be posted in the premises to which it relates in order for the employees to see it easily. Duties of Employers and Occupiers The cost of implementing the provisions of the Act may not be recovered from the work people employed in the premises by levying charges on them. The enforcing authority must be notified immediately of any accident which causes the death of a person employed to work in the premises, or which disables any such person for more than 3 days from doing their usual work. Deaths subsequently resulting from such accidents must also be notified. -28- As from 1st May, 1964 anyone Intending employing persons in offices, shops or railway premises, is required to send a notification on the prescribed registration form to the enforcing authority. Premises already in use on that date were required to register in the same way before the 31st July, 1964. Duties of Employees It is an offence for anyone on premises to which the Act applies to do wilfully anything likely to endanger the health or safety of persons employed in them, and it is also an offence for a person without reasonable cause, to deface or remove a notice or document which the Act or Regulations requires to be on display. Enforcement There are three main classes of enforcing authorities for the general provisions of the Act - local authorities, H.M. Inspectors of Factories, and H.M. Inspectors of Mines and Quarries depending on the class of premises concerned. The fire authorities are responsible for enforcing all the provisions relating to fire precautions in most premises to which the Act applies. In this Borough the Fire Authority Is the London County Council. The various classes of premises to which the Act applies are divided between the three enforcing authorities as follows (1) H.M. Inspectors of Factories administer the Act in - (a) Premises owned or occupied by the Crown. (b) Premises occupied by county councils, local fire and police authorities, probation committees. (c) Premises provided and maintained by county councils and local authorities for purposes connected with the administration of justice. (d) Premises in a school maintained by the local education authority. (e) U.K. Atomic Energy establishments. (f) Offices and shops in factories and other places covered by the Factories Act, 1961. (g) Railway premises and railway offices (except offices in railway hotels and those not situated in the immediate vicinity of the permanent way). Fuel storage premises on land owned by railway undertakers. -29- (2) Premises administered by H.M. Inspectors of Mines and Quarries - (a) Offices, shops and fuel storage premises at mines and quarries. (3) Premises administered by local authorities - (a) All other offices and shops, except offices and shops in places of public entertainment, which in London are administered by the London County Council. Commencement of the Act and Regulations The Minister of Labour made an Order bringing into operation the various sections of the Act on different dates. Those provisions of the Act which came into force on the 1st May, 1964 included those dealing with applications for fire certificates, registration, and applications relating to exemption of any room or premises from the requirements as to overcrowding and temperature of offices, and exemption from the requirements to provide sanitary conveniences and running water. With the exception outlined below the majority of the remaining sections of the Act came into operation on the 1st August, 1964. Premises in use prior to the 31st July, 1963 (when the Act was passed) will not be subject to the numerical space standards until the 1st August, 1967* Premises, however, which were not so used on the 31st July, 1963,.including those which first came into use after that date, must conform to the required standard from 1st August, 1964. Regulations creating standards in connection with the section requiring suitable and sufficient washing facilities, including clean running hot and cold or warm water, together with soap and towels or other alternative means of drying or cleansing, have been made and will operate from 1st January, 1966. Also in operation from the 1st January, 1966 are the Sanitary Convenience Regulations, 1964 in which is determined what is suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation for employees in offices, shops and railway premises. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises First-Aid Order, 1964 prescribes the first-aid requisites and appliances to be contained in first-aid boxes or cupboards. The part of the Regulations dealing with these particular requirements came into operation on the 1st December, 1964. The remainder of the Order prescribes -30- the conditions a person is required to satisfy before he is deemed to be trained in first-aid, and will operate from the 1st September, 1965. Other Regulations and Orders made under the provisions of the Act include The Prescribed Dangerous Machine Order, 1964; Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 (Exemption No.2) Order, 1964; Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Annual Reports Order, 1964; Offices, Shops in Factories (First-Aid) Regulations, 1964; Offices at Buildings, etc. (First-Aid) Regulations, 1964; Offices in Electrical Stations (First Aid) Order, 1964. Penalties for Non-Compliance In some provisions of the Act specific penalties are laid down for a contravention of the provision. General penalties in respect of offences for which no specific penalty is provided are a fine of up to £60 (or up to £^00 in the case of a contravention likely to cause death or serious injury), and a further fine of up to £15 a day for continuing offences. An appeal to a court of quarter sessions may be made by any person who is aggrieved by an Order made by a magistrate's court in determining a complaint. The Ministry of Labour issued to the Council a supply of the prescribed forms for registration purposes and these forms in turn were supplied to owners or occupiers of offices and shops for completion and return. The onus of initial registration rested with an owner or occupier, and all persons with premises covered by the Act were required to register with the appropriate authority by the 31st July, 1964. Although the Ministry of Labour issued numerous notices advising proprietors of businesses of their responsibilities it was found in this Department that the number of registration forms received by the end of July was considerably below the figure that it was estimated should have registered. On the other hand, in spite of the Ministry's publicity in the national press, a number of applications were received from self-employed persons or from persons employing only wives or other immediate relatives. The Public Health Inspectors visited all the offices and shops in the Borough that it was considered should have registered with the Council, and the appropriate forms were delivered, where necessary, for completion. -31- Those businesses from whom applications had been received unnecessarily were also visited and the requirements of the Act, as far as they were concerned, were outlined. The following are details of the premises registered during the year, together with the general inspections carried out:- Class of Premises No. of Premises Registered during the Year No. of Registered Premises receiving a general inspection Offices 186 23 Retail Shops 681 106 Wholesale Shops, Warehouses 26 5 Catering Establishments of open to Public 99 26 Canteens 3 1 Fuel Storage Depots 1 - The following Table shows the number of persons employed in the Borough in premises on the Council's register:- TABLE NO. 9 Class of Premises No. of Persons Employed Offices 4,112 Retail Shops 4,958 Wholesale Shops, Warehouses 420 Catering Establishments open to Public 676 Canteens 111 Fuel Storage Depots 3 Of the above 4,407 are males and 5*873 females. Section 48(1) of the Act requires employers to submit, in th approved form, reports of accidents to the enforcing authority of employees who as a result of the accident are away from work for more than 3 days, or which causes the death of an employee. I am happy to report that during the period 1st August 31st December although 16 accidents were formally reported to this Council, in the majority of instances the injuries were of a relatively minor nature. -32- The most common injury was cuts to hands and fingers sustained by assistants in butchers' shops, and several accidents were caused by slipping on over-polished floors, from stepladders or from falling downstairs or staircases. One person who tripped and fell down a flight of stairs cracked a bone in his foot. Another fracture occurred to the arm of an employee who tripped and fell into a shallow disused pit in a yard; - The remaining accidents reported resulted in sprains or bruises. One of the objects the Ministry hope to achieve by making it necessary for employers to report details of accidents that occur to their employees during the course of their employment, is the prevention, where possible, of similar accidents happening to employees in the future. In this connection the Public Health Inspectors fully investigated all accident notifications. Obviously, in the case of the man falling into a pit in the yard of his employers' premises, the accident may have been avoided or have been less severe if the pit had been covered. Following the Public Health Inspector's investigation and recommendation the pit was properly covered and made safe. Highly polished floors, the cause of several accidents, can be made safer if a non-slip polish is used and the responsible employers were advised accordingly. One employee slipped and fell off a pair of steps, caused in part because the steps were defective. A cleaner had a splinter embedded in a finger through cleaning a wooden table top. Both these articles were subsequently replaced. Not all accidents reported, however, can be attributed to negligence, or thoughtlessness or carelessness on the part of an employer. People fall over or sometimes trip up for no apparent reason, and young butcher's apprentices through lack of experience will doubtless continue to cut their fingers from time to time. Nevertheless, from the experience gained so far in this field, it appears to be an extremely worthwhile exercise to investigate the cause of all accidents occurring to employees. It is perhaps significant to note that all the accidents reported concerned employees of large organisations such as banks, chain and co-operative stores, multi-grocers shops, etc. Whilst by virtue of their size it could reasonably be expected that such organisations would have a larger number of accidents to report, it would seem likely that employers of units of labour without welfare or personnel departments, may be overlooking their responsibilities in notifying the Council of accidents. It may well become necessary for the Ministry of Labour (to whom returns -33- of accidents are submitted by enforcing authorities quarterly) to consider what other means can be adopted to ensure that enforcinj authorities are notified of the occurrence of all accidents to employees in registered offices and shops. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961 - CHIIDREN's NIGHDRESS REGULATIONS, 1964 By the Consumer Protection Act, 1961 regulations can be made by the Secretary of State imposing requirements in respect of any prescribed class of goods, to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury. The above Regulations, which came into operation on the 1st October, 1961, require that, with certain exemptions, no person may sell or have in his possession for sale a children's nightdress not complying with the Regulations. Regulation 1 relates to the materials used in the garments and, among other things, requires any fabric used to be of a kind capable of satisfying the requirements of the British Standard for fabrics "described as of low flaramability". Regulation 2 relates to the labelling of nightdresses made of fabrics which have been treated with chemicals to make them safer from fire. Under Regulation 3 the prohibition on sale of goods not complying with the Regulations will apply to goods manufactured before the coming into operation of the Regulations. All shops in the Borough selling garments of this kind were visited to check that children's nightdresses held in stock or offered for sale complied with the British Standard. In no instance were stocks of nightdresses held or offered for sale which did not comply in all respects with the Children's Nightdress Regulations. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE The year saw rapid progress in welfare services provided for old people by the Council. With the appointment of two additional Health Visitors specialising in the visiting of the elderly, it was possible to arrange for many more visits than had previously been possible. The total number of visits carried out during the year was over 18,000. Many elderly people were visited for the first time and were found to be in urgent need of health or welfare assistance; this was arranged, as appropriate, with the various domiciliary and residential services. The Council's staff were in regular contact with many organisations and individuals interested in the welfare of the elderly. A summary of the work carried out during 1964 is as follows:- No. of Old People on Register 1. 1.64 - 5,106 No. of Old People on Register 31.12.64 - 5,640 No. of housebound 1,148 No. of bedridden 56 No. living alone 1,105 Total No. of visits by Old People's Visitors ' Office interviews 1,169 Meals-on-wheels delivered 30,034 Meals served at Borough Council Luncheon Clubs 63,765 Articles laundered 54,594 Luncheon Clubs Another Luncheon Club was opened during the year, this time at the Coldharbour Community Centre, making six Council luncheon clubs operating in the Borough. At these clubs an elderly person can obtain a main meal and sweet at a cost of 1/ld. The value of such clubs from a recreational and nutritional point of view is obvious, and the Council's policy is to establish more luncheon clubs in other areas of the Borough where the need is greatest. In addition to the meals served at these six luncheon clubs, over 600 meals a week are also served at the Victorians Club, Eltham. -35- MEALS -ON-WHEELS During the year the Council brought two more Meals-on-Wheels vehicles into service in the Borough, making a total number of six vehicles in daily use. Approximately 150 elderly persons were receiving the service on four days a week, and a further 50 on three days a week. The Council were indebted to the Women's Voluntary Service for valuable help in this work. HOLIDAY SCHEME Holidays were arranged for five parties of 40 elderly persons at boarding houses at Westgate during the Spring and Autumn. This scheme was intended for those who have not had a recent holiday and could not otherwise have had a holiday. The great majority of the persons participating were in receipt of National Assistance, or would have been entitled to receive National Assistance had they applied. Convenient local coach pick-up points were arranged; escorts accompanied the parties to Westgate and retired couplesagain stayed at one of the two Guest Houses during the holiday periods. Many letters of appreciation were received, including one from relatives of a man who was taken seriously ill whilst on holiday and who was returned home by the Council's minibus and staff. During the year the Council entered into negotiations for the purchase of the Sea Grange Hotel, Westgate, which is classified as a 'two star' hotel, and is situated on the sea front in Cliff Road, immediately next door to the Greenwich Old People's Holiday Home. The accommodation of the Sea Grange Hotel comprises JO bedrooms, 4 private bathrooms, 5 communal bathrooms, 2 lounges, 2 large dining rooms and a well appointed bar. The Council approved the purchase of this Hotel, to be run in conjunction with the Greenwich Holiday Home when the two Boroughs amalgamate from the 1st April,1965* HOLIDAY RELIEF SCHEME Many requests are received each year from relatives looking after' aged parents for help in finding temporary accommodation for the old person to enable the relatives to have a holiday break. To help these people the Old People's Welfare Committee approached the Avery Hill Teachers' Training College at Eltham with a view to booking ground floor accommodation during the month of August. This approach was acceptable to the College authorities, and fifty ground floor student rooms were booked for a fortnight to accommodate 96 handicapped and homebound old people, many of whom had not themselves had a holiday for several years. The majority of the old folk required -36- care and attention, The College authorities were responsible for the catering and domestic services, and the Borough Council responsible for caring for the elderly holidaymakers, for the provision of transport from their homes to the College and returning them home, and for the provision of nursing and other staff and night attendants. Entertainment was provided by the Amenities Committee, and the Soroptimist Club of Woolwich helped to provide recreational activities. Afternoon coach outings to the countryside were arranged, and film shows and television facilities provided in the lounges. A most heartening feature of the scheme was the valuable help received from voluntary workers, particularly local senior schoolgirls, who carried out their tasks very enthusiastically. The members of the staff of the Health Department were on duty continuously. The old people were able to enjoy the amenities of the College and its pleasant surroundings in perfect weather and they regarded this as a real holiday. The whole venture was an undoubted success and the Council hope to repeat it in future years. The scheme received a,good deal of publicity in the national press,-in the local government press and in the local press. RECREATIONAL OUTINGS AM) CONCERTS FOR THE HOMEBOUND The Council's utilibus was used daily to convey homebound and less active old people to luncheon clubs, day clubs, on outings and on other recreational activities. In view of the success of these recreational facilities for the homebound and handicapped, the Old People's Welfare Committee approved the purchase of a second vehicle, this time a 20-seater coach with a Burtonwood tail-lift, to be used for the conveyance of old people on various recreational activities, NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR OLD PEOPLE During the year the Old People's Welfare Committee introduced a scheme to supply nutritional supplements, such as Bovril, Horlicks, Marmite, Ovaltine, Ribena, Complan, etc. to old age pensioners in the Borough at reduced prices. These foods are purchased by the Council and distributed to voluntary organisations for re-sale to elderly persons attending their clubs, and other organisations for sale to relatives and friends -37- of homebound old people. The scheme is proving very popular. The foods are sold subject to suitable safeguards that only pensioners receive them and only in sufficient quantities for personal use. PUBLICITY To ensure that members of the public are better informed of the old people's welfare services in the Borough, 10,000 copies of a booklet on the local services were distributed during the year. A special edition of a bookmark, dealing with the work of the Old People's Welfare Committee, was also produced and distributed from the Council's libraries. DOMICILIARY CHIROPODY SERVICE During the year over 400 visits were made to some 130 old people in the Borough by the domiciliary chiropodist. This scheme was arranged by the Woolwich Council of Social Service to supplement the existing chiropody service for old people. FUEL SUPPLIES FOR OLD PEOPLE Thanks to the generosity of the Mayor, once again arrangements were made for the purchase of £30 worth of solid fuel to be held in reserve against winter emergencies. VOLUNTARY WORK Some 100 workers and visitors were enrolled at the end of the year on the Council's list of volunteers regularly visiting and helping old people. Assistance was given with the following activities - house decorating, minor domestic repairs, gardening, hairdressing, sewing and mending, friendly visiting, shopping and emergency care, and so on. Senior schoolgirls and groups of young people assisted some 45 old folk in this work. The voluntary visitors report direct to the Old People's Welfare staff of the Council. Successful meetings of voluntary workers were held during the year. The object of these meetings is to explain the latest developments in local work for old people and to hear at first hand -38- the views of voluntary workers, together with any suggestions for improving the service. These meetings are each attended by some 150 voluntary visitors and other helpers, including voluntary drivers, helpers on the meals service, voluntary escorts, hairdressers and others. FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS APPEAL The Mayor, Alderman Garnett, in his Christmas appeal for the old folk of Woolwich, raised over £2,000 and this money was distributed to old people in the form of gifts. A large number of volunteers distributed the parcels, HOUSING REPAIRS The number of occupied dwellinghouses in the Borough at the end of the year was estimated as 46,172. Premises inspected for defects during the year under the Public Health and Housing Acts totalled 2,928. Of the premises inspected 83b were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. A total of 585 houses were made fit or repaired by informal action. The number of Intimation Notices served was 512. In 27^ cases it was found necessary to serve Statutory Notices to ensure that the necessary repairs were carried out. OVERCROWDING Resulting either from complaints received from housing applicants or from the Housing Department, 40 inspections were carried out during the year in connection with unsatisfactory housing conditions or overcrowding. Three families were found to occupy accommodation that was statutorily overcrowded and details of these families were reported to the Chief Housing Officer. It is the responsibility of the Council to supply in writing a statement showing the permitted number in respect of any dwelling; in this connection 290 premises were visited and measured following requests from either landlords or tenants. -39- INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES The following houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation, and Demolition and Closing Orders were made by the Council as followss- Demolition Orders - 6l and 114 Eltham Road 88 Eltham High Street 46 Footscray Road 12 Brookhill Road 15 and 17 Purrett Road Closing Orders - 6 and 7 Ordnance Road 80 Brookhill Road 48 Richmond Place 126, 130 and 132 Southland Road 39 Arthur Grove 8 and 12 Mabyn Road 31 Raglan Road 38 and 42 Escreet Grove 16 Old Mill Road 108 Samuel Street Building rear of 22a Woolwich Common 59 Jackson Street 65 Eglinton Road On the satisfactory completion of work to make the accommodation fit the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of 53 Footscray Road (part); 29 Waverley Road, and 73 Brookhill Road (part). HOUSING ACT, 1964 The above Act received the Royal Assent on the l6th July, 1964 and all parts of it are now operative. Part I - Assistance for Housing Societies Providing Housing Accommodation This Part provides for the setting up of a "Housing Corporation" to promote and assist the development and functioning of housing societies., The Corporation is authorised to lend money to housing societies. It may acquire land to sell or lease to them, and may prepare land acquired by it for building. Subject to the approval -40- of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, it may undertake the provision of housing accommodation on the land if there is no housing society to which it can be sold or leased. Before submitting a scheme for the provision of housing accommodation to the Minister for approval, the Corporation must send a copy of it to the local authority in whose area the land is situated and it may make representations about the scheme. The Corporation may take over a scheme from a society which runs into difficulties. It may also provide legal, architectural and other technical advice to housing societies as well as to housing associations and persons interested in forming societies. Whore a housing society desires to acquire any land and has requested the local authority in whose area it is situated to acquire the land, under Part V of the Housing Act, 1957 for the purpose of selling or leasing it to the society, the Corporation may purchase it compulsorily upon be?ng satisfied that the local authority are unwilling to do so, or are only willing subject to conditions which are not acceptable to the society. The local authority will have the right to make representations to the Minister about the proposed compulsory purchase. Provision is made for advancing up to £50 m. to the Housing Corporation, which sum may be increased to £100 m. subject to the approval of Parliament. Part II - Compulsory Improvement of Dwellinp;s to Provide Standard Amenities Clause 13 empowers local authorities to declare and advertise improvement areas and specifies the physical condition of the dwellings, which must be taken into account in selecting the areas. The local authority must be satisfied that the area contains dwellings which are without one or more of the standard amenities and that these dwellings, or at least 50$ of them, are so constructed that it is practicable to improve them to the full standard, and that after they have been improved they will be fit for human habitation and, subject to normal maintenance, will remain so for not less than 15 years. This Clause places upon local authorities the duty to cause an inspection of their district to be made from time to time with a view to ascertaining whether any area ought to be declared an improvement area. -41- Clause 14 provides for the service of a preliminary notice by a local authority specifying its proposals for the improvement of a tenanted dwelling in the improvement area, with an estimate of the. cost, upon the person have control of it, the tenant and all other interested persons. The notice may specify works to the full standard or to a reduced standard. The full standard means that the house is provided with the following amenities for the exclusive use of the occupants:- (a) A fixed bath or shower which, if it is not reasonably practicable for it to be provided in a bathroom, may be in a part of the dwelling which is not a bathroom or bedroom. (b) A wash-hand basin. (c) A hot and cold water supply at a fixed bath or shower which, if reasonably practicable, is to be in a bathroom. (d) A hot and cold water supply at a wash-hand basin. (e) A hot and cold water supply at a sink. (f) A water closet. (g) Satisfactory facilities for storing food. The reduced standard refers to the provision in a dwelling, which is without them, of the following amenities:- (a) A hot water supply at a sink. (b) A water closet. (c) Satisfactory facilities for storing food. Every person upon whom a preliminary notice is served is entitled to be heard when the proposals are discussed. Clauses 15, 16 and 17 provide that after its proposals have been discussed, and within two years (or such other periods as may be prescribed) of the declaration of an improvement area the loca'l authority is empowered to serve an improvement notice specifying the works required to improve a dwelling to the full or the reduced standard, and this notice will be registered in the local land charges register. If the tenant has consented to the improvement of the dwelling to the standard provided in the preliminary notice, this notice will be an "immediate improvement notice" and will require the person having control of the dwelling to carry out the -42- works specified within 12 months (or such other period as may be prescribed), or such longer period as the local authority may allow,, If the tenant has not consented to the works being carried out, a "suspended improvement notice" will be served* This will not become effective until the tenant has consented to the improvements being carried out or there is a change of occupier. Clause 18 empowers the local authority to enforce the improvement of a dwelling at the expiration of five years from the declaration of the area as an improvement area, even though the tenant has not consented and there has been no change of occupation. In these circumstances, however, the local authority must offer, or arrange for some other authority or person to offer, suitable alternative accommodation to the tenant if he so requests. If, within six months after the expiration of five years from the declaration of the area as an improvement area no final improvement notice is served, the suspended improvement notice ceases to have effect. Clause 19 provides that a tenant occupying a dwelling which is not in an improvement area and is not in a tenement block, and is without one or more of the standard amenities, may apply to the local authority to use its powers to secure the improvement of the dwelling. The local authority will have power to enforce the improvement to the full standard or to the reduced standard and the procedure is similar to that for houses in improvement areas. Clauses 20 and 21 empower local authorities to enforce the improvement of dwellings in tenement blocks to the full or to the reduced standard. Clause 24 enables a local authority to accept an undertaking from a person willing to carry out improvement works in lieu of serving an improvement notice. Clause 26 provides that, if there is no appeal, an improvement notice becomes operative at the end of 6 weeks from the date of service, and allows a local authority to withdraw a notice at any time. .Clause 27 provides for appeals against improvement notices to be made to the County Court. -43- Clauses 28 to 30 empower local authorities to improve a property themselves and to recover the cost in cases where an improvement notice or an undertaking is not complied with. Clause authorises a lessor who incurs expenditure in complying with an improvement notice to apply to the County Court for an increase in the rent payable under the lease. Clause 35 authorises the landlord to increase the rent of a property improved under this Part of the Act similar to the provisions in the Rent Act, 1957. A local authority is required, if an application is made, to grant a mortgage loan to cover expenses which will be incurred in improving a property under the provisions of this part of the Act, subject to it being satisfied that the applicant can reasonably be expected to meet his obligations. The person on whom an immediate improvement or final improvement notice is served may, within six months from the date upon which the notice becomes operative, require the local authority to purchase his interest in the dwelling. The purchase price in such cases will be fixed as though the dwelling had been compulsorily acquired by the local authority. This Part of the Act does not apply to a dwelling provided after the end. of 1944 unless it was provided by the conversion, before Jvd October, 1961, of a building erected before the end of 1944. Part III - Assistance for Improvement of Dwellings Clauses 45 to 49 make alterations to the existing scheme of discretionary and standard improvement grants for private owners. Local authorities are empowered to make standard grants towards the cost of works to bring a house up to the reduced standard (provision of a hot water supply to a sink, a water closet, and facilities for storing food) in cases where it is not practicable to provide all the standard amenities at reasonable expense. Where a grant is made towards the provision of a fixed bath or a shower, it is no longer essential for this to be in a bathroom or a bedroom, if this is not reasonably practicable. The present limit upon the amount of a standard grant is half the total cost of carrying out the necessary work, with a maximum of £155- If a bathroom is provided by a new building or -44- the conversion of outbuildings attached to the dwelling, a septic tank is installed or a piped supply of cold water is brought into the house for the first time, this maximum may be increased to £350. Clauses 50 to 52 make similar alterations in respect of dwellings owned by local authorities. Clause 53 reduces from 15 years to five years the length of leasehold interest necessary for an application to be made for an improvement grant or a standard grant, and Clause 54 reduces from 10 years to three years the period during which the conditions of grant attach to a dwelling. These conditions stipulate that the dwelling must not be used for purposes other than a private dwelling house and restrict the rent which may be charged. Clause 56 provides that the rent limit for houses not subject to controlled tenancies will be calculated on the basis of the 1963 gross value, instead of twice the 1956 gross value. Clause 60 increases the maximum permissible amount of improvement grant for the provision of dwellings by the conversion of houses of three or more storeys from £400 to £500 per unit. During the year the Public Health Inspectors carried out 257 inspections on properties in connection with applications from owners for improvement grants. Of this total 118 were in respect of "discretionary" grants, 59 were in respect of "standard" grants. An additonal 80 visits were made to advise owners or builders on enquiries regarding improvement grants. Part IV - Houses in Multiple Occupation Clause 64 provides that if the proprietor of a house which is let in lodgings or is occupied by members of more than one family fails to do the work required by a local authority under Sections 14 to 16 of the Housing Act, 1961 (the work necessary to make good defects arising from neglect, works necessary to make the premises reasonably suitable for the persons occupying it, and the provision of means of escape in case of fire), and the local authority carry out the work, the costs recoverable by the authority are, until recovered, to be a charge upon all the interests in the house. -45- Clause. 65 makes it an offence wilfully to fail to comply with a notice requiring the execution of works in a house in multiple occupation and renders the person liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 for a first offence, and in the case of a second and subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding £100 and/or imprisonment for not more than three months. Clause 67 empowers a local authority to specify the number of households or individuals a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family and, which in its opinion is defective, having regard to the number of occupants, could reasonably accommodate if specified works were carried out. It can, at the same time, require the execution of such works. Clause 68 provides that an officer of a local authority may enter a property without notice and, if necessary, by force, provided he is authorised by a warrant granted by a Justice of the Peace, Clause 69 extends the power granted under the Housing Act, 1961 relating to the application of a management code to houses in multiple occupation to any tenement block which, on the ljth November, 1963 lacked any of the standard amenities. Clause 70 removes the time limit in the Housing Act, 1961 which prevents local authorities from making schemes for the registration of houses in multi-occupation before November, 1964. It enables a local authority's scheme to impose an obligation upon proprietors of houses which are already multi-occupied when the register is being compiled to notify them of the fact. Clauses 73 to 90 provide for control orders. A local authority has power to make a control order in respect of a house in multiple occupation if it is satisfied that its physical state or the extent of occupation would make It subject to action under the Housing Act, 1961 and this is necessary to protect the safety, welfare and health of persons living In it. A control order comes Into effect immediately and notice of its making must be given to the person in control of the house, the residents, and all other persons known to have an interest in it. Having made a control order, the local authority may enter and take possession of the property, and it is authorised to take any action that the owner would be entitled to do. It has a duty to maintain proper standards of management and to make any bad conditions which the landlord would have been called upon to make good if there had been no order. It may create rights of occupation in the nature -46- of tenancies, terminable by notice of not more than four weeks. Tenants or licensees living in the house are to have the same rights during the local authority's occupation as they previously had„ They are under a duty not to impede the local authority's introduction of good management practice. Any part of a house occupied by a person who has an interest in the whole of the house may be excluded from a control order. The local authority is to pay to the dispossessed proprietor compensation at an annual rate equal to half the gross value of the dwelling, to be paid by quarterly instalments. After a control order has been made the local authority must prepare a scheme fixing a limit on the number of persons or households living in the house, detailing the works necessary to it and giving an estimate of the cost of the capital works proposed. The scheme must include an estimate of the "settled surplus", which is produced by setting the Council's revenue from rents against all non-capital outgoings. This surplus is to be set off against the cost of the capital works specified in the scheme, and the balance of the reasonable costs of the works outstanding upon the termination of the order will remain a charge upon the house. The right to possession of furniture included in any letting or lodging in the house will vest in the local authority, but it may renounce this right. Anyone with an interest in a house in respect of which a control order is trade may appeal to the County Court on the grounds that the order is unnecessary or that it is defective "in law. Appeals may also be made against the local authority's scheme on the grounds that it is too elaborate or expensive, that the limit on the number of individuals or households permitted to live in the house is unreasonably low, or that the "settled surplus" is too low. If any order is revoked, the Courts may allow the local authority to recover from rents already collected or, as a charge upon the house, the cost of work already carried out. An order expires after five years if it is not revoked sooner. Part V - Miscellaneous and General Part V deals with aluminium houses and amendments to the Clean Air Act. Clauses 92 to 9^ provide for compensation to be paid for type "B2" aluminium houses owned by local authorities and development corporations which are irreparably damaged by corrosion, for their demolition, and for payment by the Minister for the repair of type "BL8" aluminium houses. -47- Clause 95 amends the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956 about the grant payable when smoke control areas are established. It extends eligibility for grant to dwellings built between the passing of that Act and the l6th August, 1964 where it is necessary to replace open grates by other appliances. The Clause also gives local authorities and the Exchequer a wider discretion as to the expenditure to be taken into account for grant purposes. Hitherto grant has only been payable on the provision of gas or electric ignition appliances where this involved "works". This Clause now makes the provision of gas, electric or other special means of ignition eligible for grant in all cases. Grant may be withheld for the installation of any appliances which would impose undue strain upon "uhe fuel resources available for the area. Clause 96 empowers a local authority to make a grant toward the cost of the provision of a separate service pipe for a house which has a piped supply of water from a water main but no separate service pipe. Clause 97 increases from £3 to £8 per year the grant the Minister may make to local authorities to repair unfit houses owned by them so as to prolong their useful life as temporary accommodation. SLUM CLEARANCE AREAS The following Borough Council Clearance Areas were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year:- Area Date of Confirmation Elmley Street (No. l) Area (comprising 42 houses) 3-9(odd) and 13-31(odd) Elmley Street; 1,3,29,31, 2-12(even) and 16-30(even) Southport Road. 67-76(cons.) Walmer Terrace. 1st September, 1964 Elmley Street (No. 2) Area (comprising 4 houses) 43-49(odd) Elmley Street. 1st September, 1964 Elmley Street (No. 3) Area (comprising 9 houses) 45-6l(odd) Glyndon Road. 1st September, 1964 -48- Both these Areas constitute part of the Council's Glyndon Redevelopment Area. They are in an area zoned for residential purposes. The Council had, following my earlier representation that the properties were unfit for human habitation, made a Clearance Order in respect of l-4(cons.) Taylor's Buildings, Spray Street, S.E.18. Confirmation of-the Order was received by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 27th April, 1964. CLEAN AIR Further progress was made in 1964 towards bringing the whole of the Borough under Smoke Control by the declaration of further Smoke Control Areas. At the end of 1964 there were 20 Areas in operation. The following Areas, details of which have been previously reported, are now in operation:- St. Mary's Clothworkers Wood St. Mary's No. 2 Coldharbour St. Mary's No. 3 New Eltham St. Mary's No. 4 Garrison North Abbey Wood Glyndon Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Glyndon No. 2 Abbey Wood No. 2 Horn Park Abbey Wood No. 3 Rockmount Middle Park (North East) Eltham Middle Park (South West) Well Hall The total acreage of these Areas is 4,983 acres with over 29j700 dwellings subject to Smoke Control. With the addition of the Shooters Hill and Glyndon No. 3 Smoke Control Areas declared during the year, of which details are set out below, over 34,000 dwellings are within Smoke Control Areas. Details of all the individual areas are set out In Table No. 10 and the accompanying map. SHOOTERS HILL This is a large area of predominantly private property. It comprises 480 acres, and 4,360 dwellings. Of the total number 138 are Borough Council permanent dwellings and 110 temporary dwellings, 647 are London County Council permanent dwellings, 34 Crown properties, the remainder being privately owned. -49- -50- TABLE NO. 10 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Map Ref.

Glyndon No. 3 6 221 1.7.64 5.11.64 1.1O.65 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH SMOKE CONTROL AREAS, Included in this Area are 88 shops, offices and other nondomestic buildings, and 1 factory. It is estimated that 75% of the dwellings require some form of conversion to the fires. It is anticipated that the operative date will be 1st December, 1965. GLYNDON NO. 3 This Area incorporates the third phase of the Council's Glyndon Redevelopment Scheme. It comprises 6 acres; 220 Borough Council dwellings are to be erected. Therefore, there will be no cost for conversion. It is anticipated that the operative date will be 1st October, 1965. NEW AREAS During 1964 preliminary work was commenced upon a further large area to the north of the Shooters Hill Area, to be known as the Plumstead Smoke Control Area. This Area comprises approximately 4,000 private properties. Prior to the amalgamation with the Borough of Greenwich the Council's target date for the whole Borough to become smokeless is 1968. PAYMENT OF GRANT A Circular (No. 46/64) was issued during 1964 by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government drawing attention to Section 95 of the Housing Act, 1964 which amended the Clean Air Act, 1956 in certain respects affecting payment of grant. This section of the Act became operative on the l6th August, 1964. It amended the Clean Air Act so as to enable local authorities to exercise a discretion in the payment of grant in respect of work carried out after formal declaration of the Order by the Council but before confirmation of the Order by the Minister. Such grants are not payable unless and until the Order is so confirmed. In addition, work carried out at the appropriate time but without prior knowledge of the Council can rank for grant. This facility has removed one of the bigger difficulties which from time to time caused a deterioration in relations between the Council and residents in Smoke Control Areas. -52- This Housing Act also permits payment of grant towards means of ignition, whether or not fixtures or works are involved. Hitherto, grant has been payable on ignition costs only when works were involved, CONVERSION COSTS The increase in the popularity of Gas Fires and the higher grant available for this type of appliance, and for the installation of Room Heaters, resulted in a considerable increase in applications for grants. The Well Hall Smoke Control Area which became operative in October 1964 was the first Area in which the increased grant aid was available. Prior to this Area the Council had been restricted to the approval of a maximum of £5. 0. Od. irrespective of the type of appliance being chosen. After lengthy discussions with the Ministry the increased level of expenditure was raised to £20. 0. Od. in respect of a gas fire and comparable prices were fixed for other improved appliances. In the Well Hall Smoke Control Area it was estimated that 3,000 dwellings required conversion work to be carried out. During 1964 the Council received 2,535 applications for approval of installation of appliances. The total cost of works carried out during the year amounted to £63,865.12. Od. Of the sum, £42,636. 9. 5d. was eligible for 7/10ths grant. Grants paid totalled £29,845. 10. 2d. HARDSHIP CASES The Clean Air Act gives the Council discretion to pay a greater than 7/10ths grant, where it considers this to be reasonable, to cover cases of financial hardship. The Council decided to pay the whole cost of reasonable works of conversion in the case of applications for owner/occupiers who are receiving retirement pensions and who are also in receipt of National Assistance. Twenty such payments were made during the year. In addition, six payments were made in respect of retirement pensioners who, although eligible, had not applied for National Assistance. -53- SUBSCRIPTIONS The Council continued to support the work of the National Society for Clean Air, and the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council. PUBLICITY In addition to the legal requirements as to publicity, the Council continued to notify residents by individual letters of every stage of the formation of a Smoke Control Area. Every effort is made to ensure that all households are acquainted with the various stages through which the Smoke Control Order passes. As is the Council's usual practice, a Public Meeting was held after the confirmation of the Well Hall Smoke Control Area. Residents were able to meet and discuss their problems with members and officers of the Council. Local fuel suppliers and representatives of the London Electricity Board and South Eastern Gas Board attended to answer enquiries from the audience and to provide displays of appliances. This meeting was very well attended. The Council's staff visited many properties within the Area at the request of residents, to advise and assess degree of works necessary to conform to the requirements of the Order. HEALTH EDUCATION The health education service again had a profitable year. The various channels of propaganda, information, guidance and exhortation were fully utilised both for continuous low-level publicity and specific campaigns. The high spot of the year was a combined home and road safety exhibition held for one week in the autumn, which enjoyed a large attendance and was instrumental in focusing the attention of residents on these twin problems. FILM SHOWS AND TALKS Response to the circular letter to local organisations offering this service continued to be high. Although the number of visits (125) show a slight drop on the peak year of 1965 this total is still well above previous years. As in the -54- past average audience figures remained at the same level with the usual variation from group to group. Pensioners organisations still continue to muster the maximum audiences. A feature of this year is that talks or talks with films have together exceeded programmes devoted entirely to films. This is a natural development of a trend noted in past years for increasing demand in this type of programme. As the option of the programme rests with the organisation concerned it is apparent that this trend is universal and may herald the saturation point of audiences by television of purely visual media. Letters of appreciation received show the value of this service in putting across the many aims of health education to the public. The Department is fortunate in having a number of members of the staff able and willing to speak on aspects of their work, and the increasing role of the informal talk is silent tribute to this ability. The triad of talks, talks v/ith films or films alone, is a well proven aid and has contributed much to the health consciousness of the residents of this Borough.

Public enquiry points, libraries, baths, visits to local organisations, local chambers of commerce, routine visits by staff are examples of those in regular use. The monthly magazine "Better Health" is distributed to local factory and workshop canteens and rest rooms, to doctors and dentists waiting rooms, and advantage is taken of this monthly distribution to include other material of topical interest. Posters on topical subjects are displayed on Council premises, the Department's transport and on railway sites hired by the Department. Through the courtesey of the Road Safety Committee some 40 sites throughout the Borough are used from time to time to spotlight specific campaigns. FOULING BY DOGS - WARNING NOTICES The demand for these notices increases each year, showing that their use in a road does result in a lessening of this problem. In view of the success of the scheme further stocks of the notices have been procured in order that the roads having a constant problem in this respect may be allowed more permanent display while releasing a larger number for mobile use. CLEAN AIR The smoke control programme required by the Council has now proceeded to the extent that most of the Borough is smoke free. In order to secure ready acceptance of the plans by the Council, much -56- publicity, information and advice is given to the public including static and mobile exhibitions. More details on the progress towards clearing the air have been given elsewhere in this Report. SMOKING MP HEALTH The Department has actively participated in the national publicity campaigns spotlighting this hazard, and posters, leaflets, etc. have received large emphasis through the various channels mentioned above. FOOD HYGIENE In addition to general publicity on this subject, much material is distributed on routine visits to places where food is prepared, stored, sold or eaten. Warning notices concerning the bringing of dogs into shops, smoking where "open" food is handled, washing the hands after using the W.C., produced by the Department have found a ready market in the food handling sector of the community. Helpful advice, supported by leaflets is given to members of the public enquiring on food matters. VENEREAL. DISEASE In addition to notices in all conveniences in the Borough giving details of confidential treatment available, many leaflets have been distributed in response to requests, particularly by local yough organisations. Following a decision by the Council emphasis was given to this problem by the use of posters in libraries and poster sites throughout the Borough. SAFETY IN THE HOME This subject is given special emphasis in the publicity programmes of the Department. Due to its lack of "news" value and consequent lack of reporting, the public is slow to realise that accidents in the home account for more deaths and injuries than any other accidental cause. Since the accident in general is not dramatic and, except to the victim, seldom catastrophic, appreciation of the problem is only attained by cold statistics which, however, indicate that the gravity is increasing year by year. Since the majority of accidents are caused by the carelessness of the individual and seldom by external agency, it -57- remains a problem of education to secure a decrease in the annual toll. A continuous publicity programme of warning and advice is given to residents of the Borough by means of posters and leaflets through the channels mentioned above. Advantage is taken through the services of the film unit to emphasise the problem and, as can be seen, 49 programmes were devoted exclusively to the problem of home safety. In a further 11 programmes mainly concerning other subjects, a short film on safety in the home was included. Over the years every organisation requesting a visit from the Department has had at least one programme devoted to home safety and many have had a series depicting various aspects of the problem. In addition to the routine publicity given to this problem, special activities have been promoted throughout the year, details of which are appended below: Local Displays Offers were made to all local organisations for the provision of a display on the home accident problem at any public fete, bazaar or similar activity they were organising. Eleven organisations took advantage of this offer and useful publicity and dissemination of literature was obtained. This is a useful means of reaching the public at a point and time when they are most receptive. Artificial Respiration Lecture/Demonstrations During the month of July four public lecture/demonstrations of artificial respiration were arranged at different centres in the Borough. Although manual methods were shown emphasis was placed on the expired air method, and opportunity was given for public participation. The series was well attended, and the Department is indebted to the Baths and Libraries Committees for the loan of demonstrators and "resusci-anne" model and for the use of library premises. Castlewood Day Hospital Arrangements commenced in 1963 continued throughout 1964 for each group of patients at this Hospital to receive a short course -58- on home accident prevention. It is felt that this course assists in some measure in the rehabilitation of these patients, and it is planned to continue the course indefinitely. Home Safety Training During the year a number of groups of the Girls' Life Brigade and Girl Guides Association were trained and/or examined in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme regarding home safety, and also in safety badges of the parent organisations. A number of other youth organisations also received short courses in home accident prevention and it is felt that training of the potential parents of the future will be useful in long term reduction of the problem. Advisory Service The advisory service instituted in conjunction with the local Group Hospital Management Committee appears to be working smoothly and leaflets and advice have been given to interested enquirers. National Home Safety Campaigns Full support and publicity has been given to the national campaigns initiated by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, and a number of local activities have been instituted to highlight the particular problem chosen. Sight Protection Campaign (January - March) Local Action: 1) Local opticians co-operated in displaying posters and distributing leaflets on the problem. 2) Supplies of leaflets sent to local schools. Do-It-Yourself With Safety (Mid-May - September) Local Action: Local handyman hobbies and Do-It-Yourself shops canvassed for display of posters and distribution of leaflets. -59- Winter Hazards (October - December) Local Action: 1) Posters on using flame-resistant clothing materials to local clothing stores and shops. 2) Posters to local fuel merchants on the advisability of fitting fireguards. 3) Fireguard and oil heater posters to ironmongers. 4) Christmas hazard campaign material to local retailers. Fireworks Campaign and Sale of Fireworks 1) Campaign - Full support was given to the national campaign organised by the British Firework Manufacturers' Safety Association, and in addition local action was taken by the distribution of posters and leaflets to local retailers for display. Excellent co-operation was received in this respect. 2) Following on the injuries arising from the misuse of fireworks in-1963* the Home Safety Committee felt that the law relating to this matter was insufficient. A recommendation was therefore sent to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee for notification to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in these terms - (i) That the fee payable in respect of the registration of - premises into which fireworks are introduced for storage, distribution or re-sale, be increased from 1s. Od. to 10s. Od. (ii) That the statutory provisions for the registration of - these premises be reviewed and that a requirement be imposed for a notice regarding the sale of fireworks to be displayed by the retailer. (ill) That no firework be sold to a person apparently under - the age of 16 years. (iv) That the retail sale of fireworks be restricted to a period of 3 weeks in any year. (v) That the possibility be explored of making it an offence - to purchase fireworks for or on behalf of a person under the age of 16 years. -60- The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee has referred the proposal to constituent Councils the majority of whom, it is understood, are in strong agreement with the measures suggested. The Children's Nightdress Regulations, 1964 These Regulations, made under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961 came into force on the 1st October, 1964. The Regulations relate to the fabric to be used, labelling of fabrics which have been treated to make them flameresistant, and the prohibition on sale of goods not complying with the Regulations. Under the Act local authorities are empowered to arrange for inspecting and testing. Excluded from the Regulations are nightdresses unsuitable for wear by persons under the age of 13 years, infant gowns suitable for wear by newly-born babies, and materials sold in the piece. The Regulations are a first step towards decreasing the danger of burns from flammable clothing, but it is still felt that the danger exists, particularly from nightwear made at home by mothers. There is a possibility that these provisions will be extended to all material intended for clothing, and it is to be hoped that this will occur soon. Upon the coming into force of the Regulations, local retail shops were issued with copies and the inspecting staff of the Department made checks on the observance of the Regulations. Home and Road Safety Exhibition: 11th - l8th November,1964 In order to increase the safety consciousness of the residents of the Borough a Home and Road Safety Exhibition was arranged in the Autumn of 1964. To foster interest in the Exhibition and to act as advance publicity, a poster competition was arranged through local schools and youth organisations. -61- The response to this was excellent and the winners were awarded their prizes during the opening ceremony. All entries were displayed at the Exhibition. The Exhibition itself attracted large attendances, many schools and local organisations attending in organised parties. Support in exhibiting was given by the South Eastern Gas Board, the London Electricity Board, the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross Society, and the London County Council Division 6 of the Health Department. Much of the material was loaned from a variety of sources. Thanks are due to all those who took active part in or readily loaned material for the Exhibition and thus helped to ensure its success. It can be reasonably said that the Exhibition was effective in placing the problems of safety before the residents of the Borough in spectacular form. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES AT WHICH FOOD IS OFFERED OR PREPARED FOR SALE A total of 1,698 inspections of food premises, other than the daily market inspections, were carried out during the year by the Food Inspectors. Inspections of registered food premises were as follows:- Visits to Dairies 8; Distributors of Milk 44; Ice-cream premises 190; Premises where Meat is Potted, Pickled, Pressed and Preserved 248; Premises where Sausages are manufactured 123; Premises where Fish is Cured or prepared for Frying 26; Wholesale dealers in Margarine 2; Restaurants, Cafes and Snack Bars 3^8; Industrial and School Meals Service Canteens 13; Bakehouses 6; Itinerant Vendors 8; Non-Registered Premises 114; Greengrocery and Fish Shops 68; Public Houses 179- FOOD SAMPLING, 1964 During the year ended 31st December, 1964, 911 samples of food and drugs (being 717 informal and 194 formal samples) were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these 28 informal samples -62- were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 3.1 compared with 2.0 in 1963. No private samples were examined during the year.

A Dealer's Pasteuriser's Licence and a Dealer's Steriliser's Licence are in force in respect of one Dairy. In respect of Distributors of Milk, the following licences issued under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, i960 are in force:- 52 Pre-packed Milk licences to use the Special Designation "Sterilised" 11 -"- "Pasteurised" and "Sterilised" 68 -"- "Sterilised", "Pasteurised" and "Tuberculin Tested". Routine inspection of premises used for the distribution of milk were regularly carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. Seven formal notices had to be served to secure the remedy of defects found during the course of such inspections. The percentage of fat content of milk samples submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis were as follows:- No. of Samples 4.5 per cent. and over 7 4 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 17 3.5 per cent. and under 4 per cent. 83 3 per cent. and under 3.5 per cent. 59 Below 3 per cent. Nil. -65- Of the 24 samples containing 4 per cent. of fat or over, 19 were submitted as Channel Islands milk and 5 as ordinarymilk. No Channel Islands milk contained less than the minimum legal requirement of 4 per cent. of fat. In order to assess the keeping quality of the milk, 187 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, for the Methylene Blue Test. Three of the samples submitted were not tested as the shade temperature exceeded 65 F., but satisfactory reports were received in respect of the remaining 184 samples. A total of 187 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were also sent to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, for the Phosphatase test, which determines the adequacy of pasteurisation. All the samples tested were passed as satisfactory. Satisfactory reports were received from the Park Hospital Laboratory in respect of 31 samples of Sterilised or Tuberculin Tested Sterilised milk subjected to the Turbidity test. The practice of sampling milk during the course of early morning delivery to schools, hospitals and institutions was continued during the course of the year. Seven samples taken in this manner were submitted for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and seven samples were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for Methylene Blue and Phosphatase Tests. ICE-CREAM The number of premises in the Borough registered for the sale of ice-cream totalled 315 by the end of the year. With the exception of 4 premises, which are registered for the manufacture and storage of ice-cream, pre-packed ice-cream only is sold. Inspections of premises where ice-cream is sold, stored or manufactured are made regularly. All applicants for registration of premises for the sale of ice-cream are first visited and advised of the statutory requirements contained in the Heat Treatment Regulations in addition to the usual inspection of the premises. -66- During the course of the year 117 samples were taken and submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue Test. One hundred samples were graded as satisfactory and 17 unsatisfactory. The unsatisfactory samples were all of soft ice-cream. Investigations following receipt of the unsatisfactory samples were carried out to ensure that the machinery used for the dispensing of this type of ice-cream was being cleaned and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Where unsatisfactory reports were received the Public Health Inspectors visited the shops from which the ice-cream samples were purchased and instructed the proprietors to dismantle and sterilise the machine in the prescribed manner in their presence. Following reassembly further samples were then taken and submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory. Subsequent samples taken in this manner were in the majority of cases reported upon satisfactorily and it would seem likely that there was a connection between inadequate cleaning of the machinery and unsatisfactory results of samples from such machinery. Premises where unsatisfactory reports on ice-cream samples had been received were visited regularly to ensure that a good standard of hygiene was maintained and to carry out sampling. PUBLIC HOUSES There are 152 public houses in the Borough, 27 of which serve main meals. The supervision of hygiene conditions is carried out by the Public Health Inspectors and visits are made as a matter of routine. All the defects found to require attention in the public houses were remedied by the Brewers as a result of informal action taken by the Department. COMPLAINTS OF UNSOUND FOOD During the year 47 food complaints were received In the Department. All the complaints were subsequently investigated by the Food Inspectors. In respect of two complaints, namely metal fragments embedded in an iced bun, and a wood screw found in a birthday cake, the Health Committee authorised the institution of legal proceedings. -67- The two cases were subsequently heard at the Woolwich Magistrates Court and the firms concerned were fined £12 with cost of £2. 2. 0. awarded to the Council, and £15 with costs of £3. 3. 0. respectively. The Health Committee instructed that a warning letter be sent to a Bakery in connection with a complaint of a nail baked in a bun. A warning letter was also sent to a Bakery in one of whose loaves a cigarette end was found. This course of action was adopted because the complainant could not be persuaded to give evidence willingly in Court should the Council decide to prosecute. Foreign bodes were also reported in a jar of jam, a tin of stewed steak, a tin of tomatoes, a tin of gooseberries, a bottle of milk, and loaves of bread (2 cases). In all these cases the attention of the manufacturers was drawn to the complaints and the complainants advised of the action taken. Mould growth was a cause for a number of complaints. Foodstuffs investigated with mould growths included a chocolate covered swiss roll ( 2 cases); 1 jam swiss roll; cheese; cakes; scotch eggs; meat pies (4 cases); muffins; and a loaf of bread. The retailers were visited-following receipt of the complaints and, where necessary, stale stock was withdrawn from sale and destroyed. Other complaints dealt with by the Food Inspectors included alleged unsound meat; worm in a cod; unsound pigs kidneys; bottles of sterilised milk smelling of a disinfectant; bottle of lemonade with an alleged peculiar odour. During the investigations into complaints of unsound food throughout the year It was again noted that both manufacturers and retailers of food products were as anxious as the Food Inspectors to ensure that similar complaints were not received in future, and the utmost co-operation was met from all quarters of the food industry. MEAT INSPECTION Details of animals slaughtered and inspected during the year at the Garland Road Abattoir are as follows:- -68- The total number of animals slaughtered and inspected during the year at the Garland Road slaughterhouse was 64,100, Details are as follows TABLE NO. 13 CARCASES AND OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART,1964 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed and inspected 10,524 1 - 8,993 44,582 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci) - Whole carcases condemned - - - 1 34 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 3,188 - - 620 11,464 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than Tuberculosis and Cysticerci 30.2 - - 6.9 25.7 Tuberculosis only - Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 37 - - - 472 Percentage of the number inspected affected with Tuberculosis .35 - - - 1.05 Cysticercosis - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned and treated by refrigeration 49 - - - - -69- PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in the Borough:- Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery, Encephalitis (Acute), Erysipelas, Enteric Fever, Food Poisoning, Leprosy, Malaria, Measles, Membranous Croup, Meningococcal Infection, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Pneumonia (Acute Primary), Pneumonia (Acute Influenzal), Poliomyelitis, Polio-encephalitis, Plague, Puerperal Pyrexia, Relapsing Fever, Scabies, Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina), Smallpox, Tuberculosis (all forms). Typhoid Fever (including Paratyphoid), Typhus Fever, Whooping Cough, and Zymotic Enteritis. Cases of infectious disease notified to the Department are immediately visited by the Public Health Inspectors, and disinfection is oarrled out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home the Inspectors see that home isolation continues satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding belonging to the patient Is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the room sealed and fumigated. A total of 893 cases of infectious diseases was notified during the year, being a decrease of 1,200 on the previous year. 130 cases were removed to hospital. The substantital reduction in total notifications is due to the relatively small number of notifications of measles (456 compared with 1,650 the previous year). MALARIA The first notified case of Malaria to occur in the Borough since 1957 was received. The patient, a man of 45 years of age, had suffered from Malarial attacks whilst serving with the Royal Navy during the last War. He worked in Nigeria from March to June 1964 and about one week after his return to this country he was taken ill. He delayed visiting his doctor for three days when he was immediately removed to hospital, but died shortly after admission. -70- DYSENTERY Of the 53 cases originally notified 18 were subsequently confirmed as Sonne Dysentery. Five cases were admitted to hospital, also one suspected case. A young child living at the Plumstead Rest Centre was found to be a dysentery carrier, and close surveillance was kept on the other residents. Fortunately the only confirmed notified cases were 4 children in one family, who were subsequently removed to hospital. The majority of the non-confirmed cases were found to be suffering from Gastro Enteritis or Diarrhoea. POLIOMYELITIS For the third year in succession there was no confirmed case of Poliomyelitis. Two suspected cases were treated In hospital and were subsequently diagnosed as muscle injury and tonsilitis. PUERPERAL PYREXIA Of the 96 notified cases of Puerperal Pyrexia occurring in the Borough, 43 of the patients were not Woolwich mothers. MEASLES The number of individual cases of measles notified during 1964 totalled 456, of which 7 patients were treated in hospital for various complications. All except 6 of the notified cases were under the age of 15 years. -71- TABLE NO. 14 NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES (EXCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS), 1964 Under 1 yr. 1-4 yrs. 5-14 yrs. 15-44 yrs. 45-64 yrs. 65 and over Total Admitted to Hospital Scarlet Fever - 23 46 1 1 - 71 3 Meningococcal Infection - - 3 - - - 3 3 Erysipelas 1 1 - 2 4 - 8 2 Dysentery - 4 10 4 - - 18 5 Zymotic Enteritis - 3 1 1 1 - 6 2 Pneumonia - 2 6 5 5 17 35 5 Puerperal Pyrexia - - - 96 - - 96 96 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 7 - - - - - 7 6 Whooping Cough 5 36 38 - 1 - 80 - Measles 11 228 211 6 - - 456 7 Malaria - - - - 1 - l 1 Scabies - - - - 1 - 1 - TUBERCULOSIS Table of Notifications and Deaths compared with Population Borough of Woolwich.

Of the rooms and bedding disinfected 97 rooms were occupied by persons suffering from Tuberculosis. A total of 1,204 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors to check on verminous conditions, and 267 rooms were found to have minor infestations of bugs or fleas. Disinfestation was subsequently carried out by the Department. A number of requests from residents were again received for items of old furniture, bedding, etc. to be disposed of. The unwanted items were usually worn out and in some cases were in a verminous condition. In all, 13 rooms were cleared of old furniture, and other odd items removed and destroyed at the Council's destructor included 23 mattresses, 12 sets of bedding, 4 beds, 2 three-piece suites, 11 armchairs, 3 wardrobes, 3 tables, and an old sofa. Certificates of Hygiene were issued to accompany 20 export consignments of rag wipers which had been washed, cleansed and sterilized by a local laundry. The firm concerned paid a small fee for each Certificate issued. AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons journeying to certain foreign countries are required to produce written evidence of recent successful vaccination or inoculation. These Certificates are not acceptable to the countries concerned unless the signature of the Doctor is authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health in whose area he practises. During the year 1,123 Certificates were authenticated by me; 889 relating to protection against Smallpox, 174 for Cholera, and 60 for T.A.B. inoculation. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council maintains two personal Cleansing Stations; one at Plumstead, adjoining the Turkish Baths in Plumstead High Street, and the other at Lionel Road Centre, Eltham. -74- TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Preface 2 Health Committee 4 Staff 4 General Statistics 7 Vital Statistics 7 Public Health Administration 13 Old People's Welfare 35 Housing 39 Clean Air 49 Health Education 5^ Inspection and Supervision of Food 62 Prevalence and Control of Infectious Disease 70 -75- Printed and Published by the Woolwich Borough, Council.
