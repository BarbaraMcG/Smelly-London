I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1951. The vital statistics show that the birth rate continues to fall and the death rate to rise with the result that the natural increase in the population—i.e. the excess of live births over deaths— continues to diminish. In 1951 it was only 38. The increase in deaths was mainly due to such causes as cardio-vascular disease, Influenza, Bronchitis and violence. The infantile mortality rate has increased from 16.6 to 24, but the stillbirth rate has decreased to a greater extern. No mother died as the result of childbirth. The position regarding infectious diseases was satisfactory. The 1950 epidemics of Measles and Whooping Cough continued well into 1951 but both diseases remained mild in character. For the fifth successive year there was no case of Diphtheria in the Borough. There was only one death from infectious disease, that of an adult who died from Poliomyelitis. There was a, slight increase in the number of new cases of and deaths from Tuberculosis. There were no cases of Food Poisoning. A detailed account is given of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with housing, environmental hygiene, food and water, factories, rodent control etc. Once again I express my gratitude to all members of the staff for their customary loyalty and conscientiousness throughout the year. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,475 Population 1951 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,190 Census-Population (April 1951) 69,990 Number of Inhabited Houses (1951) 19,664 Rateable Value (1951) £922,795 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,799 Total Live Births 915 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 13.0 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 15.5 Total Stillbirths 12 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 12.9 Total Deaths 877 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 12.5 Standardised Death Rate 11.5 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 12.5 Infant Deaths 22 Infant Mortality Rate 24.0 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 29.6 Maternal Deaths — Maternal Mortality Rate — Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.79 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate 445 432 877 Illegitimate 16 22 38 461 454 915 Birth rate 13.0 per 1,000 estimated home population. Males Females Total Stillbirths 8 4 12 Rate: 12.9 per 1,000 (live and still) births. Males Females Total Deaths 395 482 877 Rate: 12.5 per 1,000 estimated home population. Deaths from disease and accidents of pregnancy and childbirth: From Sepsis — Other maternal causes — Death Rate of infants under one year of age: All infants per 1,000 live births 24.0 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 22.8 Illegitimate infants per 1.000 illegitimate live births 52.6 Deaths from Cancer (all ages) 138 Deaths from Measles (all ages) — Deaths from Whooping Cough (all ages) — Deaths from Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) — Population The Registrar-General has estimated the home population to be 70,190 which is 530 less than in 1950. In the Census in April, the figure was 69,990; 31,212 males and 38,778 females. Births There were 915 registered live births in 1951, as compared with 962 in the previous year while the birth rate was 13.0 as compared with 13.6. The rate for England and Wales was 15.5. Stillbirths There were 12 stillbirths in 1951 giving a rate of 0.17 per 1,000 of the home population. The rate for England and Wales was 0.36. Infantile Mortality There were 22 deaths of infants under one year of age giving an infantile mortality rate of 24.0 per 1,000 live births. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 29.6. The increase in the number of infant deaths is due to an increase of 6 in the number of deaths of premature infants. This increase is more than offset by a reduction of 9 in the number of stillbirths as compared with 1950. 6 Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths in 1951. Deaths There were 877 deaths in 1951, 58 more than in 1950. Although there were fewer deaths from Cancer there were more from diseases of the heart or blood vessels, Influenza, Bronchitis, Nephritis and Motor Vehicle Accidents than in 1950. There were 14 deaths from Motor Vehicle Accidents and 16 from other accidents. No child under 15 years of age died as the result of an accident. Twentyseven per cent. of all deaths were of persons between 65 and 75 years of age and forty-four per cent. were over 75 years. The crude death rate was 12.5 and the standardised death rate was 11.5. The rate for England and Wales was 12.5 Each district is allotted a comparability figure by the Registrar-General which varies according to the age and sex constitution of the population as compared with those of England and Wales as a whole. The average age of the population of Finchley is considerably higher than that of the Country as a whole and as there are inevitably more deaths per 1,000 in an older population than in a younger one Finchley is allotted a comparability figure of 0.92 by which the crude death rate is multiplied in order to obtain the standardised death rate. Mortuary One hundred and twenty-one bodies were received in the Mortuary, and 25 of these were from Friern Barnet. Post-mortem examinations were carried out in all cases except one. 9 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1951 Deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year of age CAUSE OF DEATH Under 1 week 1-2 weeks 2-5 weeks 5-4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 3 months 5-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months TOTAL All Certified Causes Uncertified 15 — 1 — 16 2 4 - - 22 - - - - - - - - - - Smallpox - - - - - - - - - - Chicken Pox — — — — — - - - — — Measles - — — — — - - — — — Scarlet Fever - — — — — - - — — — Whooping Cough - — — - - - - - - - Diphtheria & Croup - - - - - - - - - — Erysipelas - - - - - - - - - - Tuberculous Meningitis - - - - - - - - - - Meningitis (not Tuberculous) - - - - - - - - - - Convulsions - - - - - - - - - — Laryngitis - - — - - - - - - - Bronchitis - - - - - - - - - - Pneumonia (all forms) - - - - - 1 1 - - 2 Diarrhoea - - - - - - - - - - Enteritis - - - - - - - - - - Gastritis - - - - - - - - - - Syphilis - - - - - - - - - - Rickets — - - - - - - - - - Suffocation, Overlying - - - - - 1 - - - 1 Injury at Birth — - - - - - - - - - Atelectasis 1 - — — 1 — — — - 1 Congenital Malformations - - - - - - 3 - - 3 Premature Birth 10 — 1 — 11 — — — — 11 Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus - - - - - - - - - - Other Causes 4 - — — 4 — — — — 4 TOTALS 15 — 1 - 16 2 4 — — 22 10 11 12 INFANT DEATH AND NEO-NATAL DEATH RATES SINCE 1925 causes of, and ages at death during the year, 1951 No. CAUSES OF DEATH NET DEATHS AT THE SUBJOINED AGES OF RESIDENTS" WHETHER OCCURRING WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE DISTRICT All Causes Certified All Ages Under 4 months 4 months and under 1 year 1 and under 5 5 and under 15 15 and under 25 25 and under 45 45 and under 65 65 and under 75 75 and upwards Uncertified 1.

During 1951, 788 children were immunised. Of these, 381 were immunised by private practitioners and 407 at sessions arranged by the Area Medical Officer. A combined Diphtheria prophylactic and Whooping Cough vaccine was used in the case of 153 of the total number of children immunised by private practitioners. The number of children immunised during the previous 3 years was as follows: — 1948 1,163 1949 982 1950 744 16 17 18 INCIDENCE OF DIPHTHERIA SINCE 1925 Scarlet Fever There were 99 cases of Scarlet Fever, 33 fewer than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis There were 5 cases of poliomyelitis of which 4 were paralytic and one non-paralytic. All of these made good recoveries, but the death of a young woman who died while on holiday in Sussex was allocated to Finchley. Measles The measles epidemic for 1950 (730 notifications) extended into 1951 when there were 647 notifications. This is the largest epidemic that has occurred since notification started and it is gratifying no death resulted from it. Whooping Cough Whooping Cough also was prevalent in 1950 and 1951. The notifications numbered 361 and 240 and there were no deaths. Pneumonia Seventy-two cases were notified in 1951 and there were 30 deaths, 25 of which were persons of 65 years of age and over. Malaria Two cases of malaria in soldiers who had served abroad were notified Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified: Dysentery 38 Erysipelas 14 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 2 Paratyphoid B 1 Puerperal Pyrexia 38 19 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1951.

Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis increased from 14 in 1950 to 16 and deaths from non-pulmonary increased from 2 in 1950 to 3 in 1951. 20 The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1942 40 39 4 3 14 19 1 1 1943 41 39 7 5 14 11 3 5 1944 48 30 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 — 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 1949 41 37 2 4 10 8 1 4 1950 37 21 2 7 9 5 2 — 1951 37 30 2 6 6 10 1 2 Medical Examinations Twenty-six persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 56 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47 Several cases were brought to the notice of the Department of persons who were living in insanitary surroundings and who were not receiving proper care and attention. In each case it was possible to make satisfactory arrangements for these persons without having to resort to compulsory removal to suitable premises under the provisions of the above section. (b) Section 50 One burial was carried out by the Council under the provisions of this section. 23 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1951: Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 1,559 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 6,732 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 - (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose — (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 2. (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 881 2. Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 655 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year: A. Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 105 (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (a) By owners 12 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 2 24 B. Proceedings under Public Health Acts: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be-remedied 61 (2) Number rendered fit: (a) By owners 55 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners — C. Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwellng-houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made — (2) Number of dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders 2 Houses Unfit for Human Habitation Elmshurst Cottage, East End Road, N.2. 5 Plowmans Cottages, Chapel Street, N.2. The above premises were found to be unfit and incapable of repair at reasonable cost and were being dealt with at the end of the year. 1116 and 1188 High Road, N.20. 1116 High Road, N.20, was demolished by the owner following an order made by the Council in 1950. 1188 High Road, N.20. A demolition order was served upon the owner, and the tenants re-housed by the Council. The owner had started demolition of the property at the end of the year. 54 Alexandra Grove, N.12. The closing order which had been made with regard to the basement flat at the above premises was rescinded, after the acceptance by the Council of an undertaking by the owner to carry out works to make the flat habitable. The necessary repairs were executed and the flat re-let. 33 Brownlow Road, N.3 This house which had been unoccupied for some years and was incapable of repair at reasonable cost was dealt with informally and demolished by the owner. 25 Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 16,304. At 920 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 2,998 were discovered, and at the end of the year 3,109 including a number outstanding at the end of 1950 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 428 was in hand and 1,883 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the santitary defects were being properly remedied 1,537 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. With costs of labour and materials still rising it is becoming increasingly difficult for owners of rent-controlled dwellings to carry out the work necessary to keep the premises in a reasonable state of repair and the time is approaching when many properties requiring major works cannot be repaired at reasonable cost. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out: Inspections under Housing Acts 52 Special Inspections 3,992 Reinspections 3,127 Inspections of Works in Progress 1,537 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 500 Visits to Slaughterhouses 9 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 24 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 71 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops 856 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 75 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 667 Visits re Rodent Control 4,611 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 175 Visits re Building Licences 40 Visits re Hawkers 59 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 6 Visits to Houses let in lodgings 18 Miscellaneous 485 16,304 26 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Number of houses and premises re-drained — Repairs or amendments to existing drains 43 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 287 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 421 Length in yards of iron drains laid 45 Manholes provided 33 Manholes repaired 8 Manhole covers provided 41 Intercepting traps fixed 4 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 6 New gully traps fixed 59 Gully curbs provided or repaired 14 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 11 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 12 Water tests applied 201 Smoke tests applied 28 Air tests applied 12 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 114 Number of articles disinfected 1,566 Number of verminous premises dealt with 27 Verminous rooms disinfested 62 Six hundred and sixty-seven visits were made by the inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. There was a substantial decrease in the number of premises, infested with bugs, 15 cases having been dealt with, compared with 30 in 1950. The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year: Premises Bugs 15 Fleas 2 Cockroaches 5 Lice 1 Beetles 4 Ants 16 Wasps 41 Miscellaneous 13 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was. 62 compared with 112 in 1950. Houses Let in Lodgings During the year one addition was made to the Register of Houses let in lodgings.

Food Hygiene Six talks and film shows for food traders were given during the winter months of the year but, in spite of letters being sent to all traders concerned and publicity by way of posters, the response was poor, as shown in the table below. It is difficult to persuade employees in the food trades, especially in the restaurant business where many of the workers are part-time women, to give up an evening of their own time.

To publicise these, 53 posters were exhibited on Council Notice Boards and in food shops These two meetings were also advertised in the local Press. 34 The following lectures were also given: Attendance (a) For the School Meals Staff, Finchley and Friern Barnet areas 40 (b)For the staff of a large wholesale bakery firm (two meetings) (1) 76 (2) 72 (c)For other Food Traders (two meetings) 30 (d)For various Organisations (six meetings) 271 Lectures and Film Shows to School Children A general talk with a preview of film strips was given at the Public Health Department to the Youth Officer and Domestic Subject Teachers. Lectures to classes of senior school children were arranged at five schools to an audience of 1,380 children. Display of Dog Notices in Food Shops Notices for exhibition in shops were sent to two hundred and forty-six traders during the year. The notices pointed out that the presence of dogs in food shops was a danger to the health of the public. Bye laws— Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Copies of the Byelaws have been supplied to all traders in the district and inspections made to ascertain that the provisions thereof are being complied with. In this connection improvements have been carried out, including the following: Kitchens reconstructed 5 Shops modernised 4 New closed shop fronts to open shops 3 Unsatisfactory premises closed 2 New water heaters provided 13 New sanitary accommodation and washing facilities 3 Additional sinks provided 5 Refrigerators provided 6 Discontinuance of keeping cats 1 35 A number of traders have been prosecuted (particulars of the cases will be found under the heading "Legal Proceedings") for offences under the byelaws, including the sale of vinegar from a dirty container and the failure of hawkers to exhibit their names and addresses on their barrows. During the year the Council adopted Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, which extended Section 279 of the 1944 Act, the effect being that all hawkers of food and their premises must be registered instead of only those carrying on specified trades, e.g., the sale of meat or meat food product or fish or fruit or vegetables. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared has received special attention. Five new registrations of hawkers were granted during the year. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked up where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. The number of barrow boys operating in the district has been materially reduced. Owing to new vehicle parking regulations in the side roads at North Finchley the police were able to take successful action against barrow boys for obstruction with the result that barrows have completely disappeared from that area. One thousand two hundred and nineteen visits were made to various food premises and improvements have been carried out in a number of cases. 36 Carcases Inspected and Condemned Cattle excluding cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed — — — — 111 Number inspected — — — — 111 All diseases except Tuberculosis: Whole carcases condemned — — — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 1 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis - - - - 0.9 Tuberculosis only: Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 3 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - - - - 2.7 Four Reindeer and one Scotch Deer carcases were inspected, the whole of the deer carcase being condemned due to a severe infestation of warble fly larvæ (Hypoderma Diana). 37 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1951 Tuberculosis Pigs 1 Head 2 Mesenteries Other Diseases Pigs I Pluck (Pneumonia and Pericarditis) Unsound Cattle 253½ lbs.

Occasional slaughtering is carried out on permit from the Food Office. 40 Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. The number of persons licensed under the Act during 1951 was 2. Butchers' Shops There are 48 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. By arrangement with the owner, the use of one unsatisfactory shop was discontinued. One new shop was opened. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 27. At 23 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. Two old bakehouses of low standard have been closed. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 9 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. 41 Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1951, as follows: Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 17 „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 16 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 20 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 7 „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 8 „ „ „ Sterilised 7 Four samples of Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) milk, five samples of Pasteurised and five samples of Sterilised were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination All these samples complied with the prescribed conditions. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only two persons make ice cream within the Borough, and both employ the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 137 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Eighteen samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls The number of coffee stalls in the Borough is two. Both are situated on the main roads. They are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. Fish Friers This business is established at 9 premises. 42 Game Licences Twenty-three applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with.

Swimming Pools In co-operation with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor samples of the water were taken at intervals throughout the summer months. 43 On all occasions the bacteriological reports on these samples were entirely satisfactory. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 10 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In addition 3 samples were submitted to the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 10 houses serving a population of 27 which are served by standpipes. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The above Act, which came into operation on the 1st November, controls premises in which rag flock and other filling materials are used in the making of new articles. A survey was made of all the upholsterers' premises in the district, and it was found that only one came within the provisions of the Act. 44 RODENT CONTROL During the year 460 complaints were received. Three hundred and nineteen of these dealt with rat infestations and 141 with mice infestations. The following table shows that since last year rat complaints, increased whilst mice complaints decreased slightly. Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 1950 1951 1950 1951 1950 1951 Rats 229 319 162 229 67 90 Mice 164 141 146 130 18 11 Total 393 460 308 359 85 101 Resulting from these complaints, rats were found at 164 additional premises.

This was reported to the Ministry of Agriculture who took appropriate action. Treatment of Sewers Sausage Rusk with Zinc Phosphide, and Bread Mash with Arsenic were used alternately, in carrying out the maintenance .treatment of sewers. 46 Two maintenance treatments were carried out during the year, with the following results: First Treatment Second Treatment Total number of manholes baited 396 563 Number of poison takes 42 72 The results of the poison takes in each treatment represent approximately 11.9% of the total number of manholes baited.
