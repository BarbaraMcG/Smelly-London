As in previous years the District Nurses have been asked to visit many of our patients who are suffering from Tuberculosis, and are being treated at home; 1,404 visits were paid by the nurses in 1942. A limited provision is made for the supply of extra nourishment to tuberculous persons, and this usually takes the form of eggs and milk; 74 patients received help in this way during the year. The scheme for the provision of shelters has been continued, and 2 shelters are at present in use. LADY ALMONER. The Lady Almoner has a variety of duties which are concerned chiefly in the after-care of tuberculous patients. She arranges for assistance to be given to patients in a number of different ways, as for instance in the supply of extra nourishment, the provision of beds, bedsteads and nursing utensils. In a few cases she has been able to arrange for a period of rest in a convalescent home, or for a country holiday in the case of exhausted mothers. She regularly visits the homes of patients who are undergoing treatment in sanatoria in order to keep the relatives informed as to the patients' progress, and to see that proper provision is made for the patients' return. In addition to these duties the Lady Almoner acts as Child Protection Visitor under Part XIII of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. RETURN SHOWING THE WORK OF THE DISPENSARY DURING THE YEAR 1942.

During the year the total number of attendances was 401. The number of new patients was 150, the majority of whom were suffering from minor disabilities of the menopause for which help could be given at the Clinic; where further treatment was indicated, the patients were either referred to their own doctor or to hospital. Twenty of the new patients were referred to hospital for operation. There were six cases of carcinoma, and of these three were in an early stage of the disease. HEART CLINK. Although the original and primary function of the Tuberculosis Dispensary is the discovery and supervision of cases of tuberculosis it has been the custom for the Tuberculosis Officer to submit to general practitioners as full a report as possible on cases of other disease which may come to light during the process of investigation. In many instances this has been of considerable assistance to the practitioners of the district. It is not unusual to find some abnormality of the heart during the investigation of disease in the chest —indeed the heart and itsmajor blood vessels hold an important place in the anatomy and physiology of the chest, and it became apparent that a better clinical service could be provided if facilities were also available for the investigation of cardiac disease. In 1939 therefore, the Council decided to establish a Heart Clinic. Postgraduate facilities were provided for Dr. Toussaint at that time, and since, and an electrocardiogram was purchased. The object of this clinic is the diagnosis and periodic supervision of patients suffering from cardiac disease. It has already proved its worth and has helped in the discovery of cases of heart trouble which in previous times might well have been missed. As in other illnesses the essence of success in cardiology is early detection of abnormality and the prevention of further damage. In later years if heart failure supervenes on some pre-existing condition the whole outlook depends on regular treatment and supervision. Both these objects can now be attained and practitioners are gradually making more use of the services available. Initial results have shown that cardiac disease is not uncommon in this district, particularly in late middle age, and it appears to affect both sexes almost equally. A great deal can be done for many of these patients and the institution of the clinic should provide opportunities for considerable research on these lines in the future. During 1942, 113 cases were investigated for the first time. OPHTHALMIC CLINIC. This clinic was opened on the 15th September, 1942. The number of patients examined during the year was 87, the total number of attendances being 113. FOOT CLINIC.

PUBLIC HEALTH (IMPORTED FOOD) REGULATIONS, 1937. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938. Sixty-nine samples were taken during the year by the Senior Inspector and Wharves Inspectors. In February a sample of curry powder was taken which on analysis was found to contain 44 parts per million of lead. Summonses were taken out and the case was heard in April at Tower Bridge Police Court. Evidence was given on behalf of the manufacturers that it was impossible to obtain the ingredients of the curry powder from the pre-war source of supply, and the manufacturer had now to accept whatever he could get. The magistrate dismissed the summons against the retailer accepting the defence of a warranty. So far as the manufacturer was concerned the magistrate was satisfied that the case against him under Section 3 of the Act had been proved, that is to say, that the curry powder had been sold to the prejudice of the purchaser. The magistrate, however, accepted the defence that the presence of extraneous matter was an unavoidable consequence of the process of collection (Sub-Section 4) and he therefore dismissed the case without costs. UNSOUND FOOD. The general inspection of food in shops and on stalls forms part of the duty of the District Sanitary Inspectors. Food, in the quantities stated, came under the notice of the Inspectors during the year, and being found unfit for human consumption was destroyed or disposed of for animal feeding purposes.
