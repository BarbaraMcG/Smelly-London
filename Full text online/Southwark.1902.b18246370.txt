Sou 27 Borough of Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the YEAR 1902. G. Millson, Medical Officer of Health London: T. Cornell & Sons, Commercial, Law and General Printers, 63, Borough Road, S.E. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Office. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Sixteenth Annual Report in relation to the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough. The year under review, I need hardly remind the Council, has been a very important one in regard to health matters and much excellent work has been done by the staff of officers concerned with it. It has been necessary to very much condense the account of what has taken place in the various branches of public health, but I hope not to such an extent as to prevent the report being readily understood. I beg to thank the members of the Public Health Committee as well as those of the Council for their courtesy and consideration on all occasions. I have also to thank the various officers under me for their support and assistance. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. TABLE OF CONTENTS. page.

POX. During the year 1902, 518 cases of Small-Pox were notified. The deaths from the same disease numbered 78. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 15.0. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .37. Deaths from Small-Pox during the last ten years:— 1893 13 1898 — 1894 2 1899 — 1895 4 1900 — 1896 1 1901 14 1897 1 1902 78 Of the 518 cases notified all, with the exception of five, of which four were in a dying state when notified, were removed at once to hospital. The Small-pox epidemic of 1901-2 in relation to this Borough commenced on August 21st, 1901, and terminated on July 11th, 1902. A full report of the cases which occurred in Southwark, together with the various measures taken to combat the disease will be found bound up with my annual report to the council for 1901. Since that report was printed I have been able to ascertain the amount of vaccination that was performed during the active period of the epidemic (excluding primary vaccinations of infants). The period taken is from October 1st, 1901, to June 30th, 1902. (1) By Public Vaccinators— Primary vaccinations of one year and upwards 1,873 Re-vaccinations 12,230 (2) By Private Practitioners— Primary vaccinations of one year and upwards 2,500 Be-vaccinations 15,000 (3) By the Medical Officer of Health— Primary vaccinations of one year and upwards 450 Be-vaccinations 1,819 Total number of primary vaccinations 4,823 Total number of re-vaccinations 29,049 It is only fair to state my appreciation of the splendid work that was done by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and its experienced officers during this epidemic. The extreme care that was shown at the South Wharf with the cases was beyond all praise, and was a very active agent in hindering the spread of the disease, 32 SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were 42 in the Borough during 1902, as against 54 in the year 1901. The total number of cases notified was 1,098 this year, as against 1,301 for last year. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 3.8. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .20. Deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last ten years:— 1893 11l 1898 4.5 1894 42 1899 21 1895 36 1900 22 1896 51 1901 54 1897 54 1902 42 Of the 1,098 cases notified, as many as 1,046 were removed to hospital. The deaths in the hospital were 39, a mortality of 3.7 per cent. The cases treated at home numbered 52, of which three died, a mortality of 5.7 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital was 95.2. "Retuen" or Secondary Cases. The number of cases supposed to have infected other children when returned home was 46, a percentage of 4.4 of the total cases sent to hospital. The number of cases returned home from the hospital as not suffering from any notifiable disease was 35, a percentage of 3.3. The Metropolitan Asylums Board has recently resolved to advise Medical Officers of Health of the discharge of patients from their hospitals. This information will enable Medical Officers to visit and watch the cases when that is required, and in my opinion will ultimately tend to very materially shorten the stay of patients in hospitals, a highly desirable thing to do if it can be accomplished, as I think it can be, without any danger of further spreading the disease. 33 DIPHTHERIA. The deaths from this disease have been much below the average for the last ten years, although slightly above the number for 1901. Last year there were 63 deaths, as against 53 for 1901. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 539, as against 558 in 1901. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 11.6. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .30. Deaths from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup during the last ten years— 1893 155 1898 123 1894 130 1899 184 1895 82 1900 108 1896 129 1901 53 1897 105 1902 63 Of the 539 cases notified, 500 were removed to hospital with 50 deaths, a mortality of 10.0 per cent. 39 cases were treated at home with 13 deaths, a mortality of 33'3 per cent. This heavy mortality of cases treated at home was largely due to the Membranous Croup cases all of which died at home. The percentage of cases removed to hospital was 92.7. The "Return" or Secondary cases numbered 8, a percentage of 1.6 on the total number sent to hospital. The number of cases returned from the hospital as not suffering from any notifiable disease was 32, or 6.4 per cent. of the cases removed from home. Diagnosis of Diphtheria. I have from time to time received complaints from medical men in the Borough, that their cases have been returned home after but a few days retention in hospital, when a bacteriological examination was said to have shown the presence of the true diphtheria bacillus in the swab submitted from the throat of the patient, and when no definite clinical symptons were present. 34 I have always replied to such complaints that it is not advisable to adopt the practice of sending cases to hospital, or even of certifying them, as Diphtheria simply on a bacteriological examination, for if we do we shall often lay ourselves open, and rightly so, to severe blame. The mere presence of the true diphtheria bacillus in the throat signifies very little by itself, as we know it is often to be found in the throat of persons in perfect health. Likewise the "negative" result of the examination of a swab says very little in the face of a distinct patch of "membrane" being on the throat. Therefore the most obvious symptom is the membrane. If that in present we can certainly say the case is one of Diphtheria, whilst the absence of any distinct membrane during the progress of the case, should incline us to consider it as not of the true disease. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Euteric Fever during the year 1902 numbered 23. as against 18 for the preceding year. The total number of cases notified was 193 for the present year, as against 135 for 1901. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 11.9. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was .11. Deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1893 29 1898 20 1894 21 1899 32 1895 23 1900 39 1896 26 1901 18 1897 21 1902 23 Of the 193 cases notified, as many as 179 were removed to hospital, with 20 deaths, a mortality of ll.l per cent. 14 cases were treated at home with three deaths, a mortality of 21.4 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 92.7. 35 The number of cases returned from the hospital as not suffering from any notifiable infectious disease was 15, or 8.3 per cent. of the cases removed from home. I have on many occasions in my annual reports referred to shellfish, such as mussels, cockles, oysters, and whelks as responsible for a large amount of Enteric Fever occurring in this Borough. All the cases of Enteric Fever notified have been visited and careful inquiries made. In at least 23 cases, the history of each of which is here given, I believe shellfish to have been the cause. 36 37 TABLE 15.

The deaths during the year from this disease were 169, as against 222 for 1901, and 233 for 1900. This decrease in the mortality must be considered as due to the comparatively cold summers of the last two years. The annual rate per 1,000 living was .81. Deaths from Diarrhea during the last ten years:— 1893 214 1898 306 1894 96 1899 260 1895 205 1900 233 1896 214 1901 222 1897 300 1902 169 In the case of every death from Diarrhoea the house was examined, and the history of the circumstances of the case fully reported upon. PHTHISIS. The deaths from Phthisis during the year were 550, as against 516 for 1901. The annual rate per 1,000 living was 2.65. Deaths from Phthisis during the last nine years:— 1894 473 1899 621 1895 533 1900 571 1896 490 1901 516 1897 520 1902 550 1898 565 During the last seven years it has been our practice to visit, and examine every house in which a person has died from Phthisis. Disinfection of rooms now takes place in all deaths from that complaint, and weekly in all cases treated at home. Voluntary Notification of Phthisis. The voluntary notification of Phthisis has been in vogue in this Borough since the latter part of 1901. Owing to the increased work consequent on the epidemic of Small-pox, this notification was somewhat neglected during the year now under consideration. At the latter part of the year it was decided to arrange a Conference between the Public Health Committee, and the medical men practising in the Borough in order to discuss the best means for preventing the spread of Phthisis. 39 On the 15th January, 1903. this Conference was held when the following questions were submitted as the bases of discussions:— (1) In the voluntary notification of Phthisis is it desirable in all cases in which a medical man is in attendance that the consent of the patient or friends be obtained to the notification before it is made? (2) Is it desirable or necessary that duplicate notification be received within six months of the original one unless the patient has changed residence in the meanwhile? (3) Is it necessary that moribund cases be notified? (4) Will the examination of sputum in morning or other coughs, be of service to medical men in the Borough if facilities be given for such examinations? (5) Is it advisable that any literature the Council of the Borough wish to be placed in the hands of the patient or friends, be handed or addressed to the medical man in attendance? At the Conference, which was well attended, the Medical Officer read a short paper on the subject which is here printed. After considerable discussion, all the questions with the exception of No. 3, were answered unanimously in the affirmative. The following letter was afterwards sent round to all the medical practitioners of the district:— Dear Sir,— In November of 1901, the Council of this Borough decided to inaugurate a system of voluntary notification of Phthisis and to pay to medical practitioners certifying cases the usual fees of 2s. 6d. and Is. The announcement of the decision of the Council was not made publicly known at the time owing to the epidemic of Small Pox engaging our attention, hence the notification of Phthisis up to the present time has not been general. The Mayor of Southwark, who has this work very much at heart, recently invited the medical practitioners of the district to meet him and a few members of the Council's Health Committee with a view of discussing the subject. The Conference was held on January 15th, and was attended by a good representative body of the medical men of the Borough. There appeared to be throughout the discussion entire unanimity on some important points. It was felt by all that in this voluntary notification of Phthisis, if any good were to be obtained, it could only be by a cordial co-operation of the Council and the medical men of the 40 Borough. On the part of the Council it was stated that the interests and the dignity of the medical man in attendance would be carefully respected. Towards the end of the Conference the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:— 1.—In the voluntary notification of Phthisis it is desirable in all cases in which a medical man is iu attendance that the consent of the patient or friends be obtained to the notification before it is made. 2.—It is not desirable or necessary that duplicate notifications be received within six months of the original one unless the patient has changed residence in the meanwhile. 3.—That the examination of sputum in morning and other coughs will be of service to medical men in the Borough if facilities be given for such examination. 4.—It is advisable that any literature the Council of the Borough may wish to be placed in the hands of the patient or friends be handed or addressed to the medical man in attendance. Arrangements have been made for examining without fee specimens of sputum from patients, the nature of whose illness is doubtful, and it is desirable that this provision should be utilised in all such cases. Believe me, Faithfully yours, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. Dr REPORT READ AT CONFERENCE. Mr. Mayor, Councillors, and Gentlemen, The decision arrived at more than a year ago by the Southwark Council to inaugurate a system of voluntary notification of Phthisis was not, owing to the outbreak of Small-pox which engrossed all our attention, acted upon with the energy that it deserved. The importance of the subject to a Borough such as Southwark, with its enormous amount of overcrowdedness and casual workers, cannot be over-estimated when it is considered that some 70,000 persons die every year from Phthisis in this country, and that considerably more than a quarter of a million persons are affected by it. 41 It is, however, some comfort to know that within the last fifty years the mortality from the disease has diminished by one half, due it is only fair to assume, to improved methods in relation to public and private health, the better feeding of the people attainable by higher wages, and, let us hope, to the improvement in the habits, exercise, and cleanliness of the community generally. Although this improvement has been observed in the country as a whole, statistics show that Loudon has not progressed in quite so satisfactory a manner. Still in London during the last fifty years, the diminution in the death rate from Phthisis has not been small, for in the decade 1851-1860, the death rate from Phthisis was 2.86 per 1,000 living, whilst for the year 1901 it was 1.71, a reduction of 40 per cent This favourable tendency in the disease has not been seen in every district or Borough of the Metropolis. For instance, in at least five of the districts the deaths from Phthisis have steadily year by year gone on increasing. If one looks at the figures for 1895, it will be seen that the Parish of St. George the Martyr had a death-rate of 3.1; St. Saviour, 3.28; Strand, 3.16; Holborn, 3.13; whilst the salubrious Hampstead had one of 1.01. Coming to the last year of these districts as Vestries, viz.:— 1900, St. George the Martyr was 3.65; St. Saviour, 3.15; Strand, 3.68; Holborn, 2.77; and Hampstead, 0.85. Our Borough with nearly a fifth of its population overcrowded, had a death-rate from Phthisis of 2.83 for 1902. These high death-rates from the disease call for the deepest attention of the Public Health Authority. Through the researches of Professor Koch of Berlin, we know that the disease is due to the introduction into the lungs of the tubercle bacillus, a microscopic vegetable parasite, through the medium of the expectoration from an infected person which has become dry, and as dust floating in the air is inhaled into the lungs. To healthy adults living under fairly good conditions, and not coming into close contact with phthisical sufferers, there is no danger of infection but healthy persons run a distinct risk if the contact between them and those infected is intimate and prolonged. Professor Koch in his paper which he read at the British Congress on Tuberculosis held in London in 1901, stated that the main source of the infection of Tuberculosis is the sputum of consumptive patients, and that the measures for the combating of Tuberculosis must aim at the prevention of the danger arising from its diffusion. Professor Koch's description of the poor consumptive with his family in one room 42 scattering the morbid material secreted by the diseased lungs every time he coughs, and his relatives close beside him inhaling the poison, must appeal with considerable force to all of us. The disease though infectious is only so to a certain extent, and to those persons in a lowered state of health. The chief predisposing causes are— (1) Poor food of a vegetable kind. (2) Dark and ill-ventilated dwellings where sunlight and fresh air cannot enter. (3) The breathing the air over and over again in crowded rooms. (4) House dampness. (5) Dust. (6) Absence of proper exercise. (7) Chronic spirit drinking. The defences are nutrition, ventilation, and sanitation. The first two are matters that the individual must assist in obtaining, whilst the last comes under the care chiefly of the Sanitary Authority. The question whether the tubercle bacillus can flourish outside the human body, that is saprophytically on the paper covering the walls of rooms which phthisical persons have inhabited, although of the most vital importance to the health authority is still unsettled. It is but fair to mention that Dr. Niven, Medical Officer of Health of Manchester, when he held a similar office at Oldham in 1896, was the first to advocate this notification and to persuade the Oldham Medical Society to formulate a complete scheme of preventive measures, which however, was not adopted by the Oldham Town Council. In Brighton Dr. Newsholme, the Medical Officer of Health inaugurated voluntary notification of Poor Law and Institution cases of Phthisis in 1898, but without any payments being made to Medical Practitioners. In 1899 the Town Council agreed to pay the usual fees of 2s. 6d. and Is., and in that year 113 cases were notified to the Medical Officer of Health. Since then other County Boroughs have adopted this voluntary notification of Phthisis, and at the present time such is the amount of educated opinion at the back of this movement, that I believe it will be universally adopted within the next few years. It is no part of my duty to prophesy when compulsory notification will be assented to by the Local Government Board. 43 I think it was a very happy idea for the Mayor to invite us to this conference on this delicate but highly important subject. We must all feel that if any good is to be got from this voluntary notification of Phthisis, it must be by the cordial co-operation of the medical practitioners with the Local Authority of the district. In fact, I believe I am justified in saying that the Council will act chiefly through the medical man in attendance. I may also state, in order to remove any apprehension, that enquiries as to the origin of the disease, will be, as far as possible, made by myself. The precautions the Borough are issuing for consumptive persons are as follows, viz.:— PRECAUTIONS FOR CONSUMPTIVE PERSONS. Consumption is, to a certain extent, an infectious disease. It is spread chiefly by inhaling the expectoration (spit) of patients which has been allowed to become dry and float about the room as dust. Do not spit except into receptacles, the contents of which are to be destroyed before they become dry. If this simple precaution is taken, there is practically no danger of infection. The following detailed rules will be found useful, both to the consumptive and to his friends:— 1.—Expectoration indoors should be received into small paper bags and burnt immediately. 2.—Expectoration out of doors should be received into a suitable bottle—to be afterwards washed out with boiling water—or into a small paper handkerchief, which is afterwards burnt. 3.— If ordinary handkerchiefs are ever used for expectoration they should be put into boiling water before they have time to become dry: or into a solution of disinfectant as directed by the doctor. 4.— Wet cleansing of rooms, particularly of bedrooms occupied by sick persons, should be substituted for "dusting" and sweeping. 5.— Sunlight and fresh air are the greatest enemies of infection. Every patient should sleep with his bedroom window open top and bottom, a screen bemg arranged, if necessary, to prevent a direct draught, and, if possible, should occupy a separate bedroom. The patient need not fear going out of doors in any weather if warmly clad. 44 N.B.—The patient himself is the greatest gainer by the above precautions, as his recovery is retarded and frequently prevented by renewed infection derived from his own expectoration. 6.—Persons in good health have little reason to fear the infection of Consumption. Over-fatigue, intemperance, bad air, dusty occupation, and dirty rooms, favour Consumption. With regard to the several questions to be found on the Agenda paper it seems to me to be necessary in Question 1 that the consent of the patient, or the friends, should be obtained before the notification is made. This will prevent inquiries at any time being made in unsuitable cases. Question 2.—It appears to me to be unnecessary to have two medical men notifying the case under a period of six months, except where the patient removes to another part of the district. Question 3.—The notification of moribund cases from the Council's point of view is not required, as all such cases appear in due course upon the death returns. Question 4.—This question is the most important of all. It has been stated, and in my opinion with great force, that Phthisis should be detected before any physical signs are apparent if a permanent cure is to be effected. If that is so, how necessary is it that in all cases of persistent morning coughs the sputum shall be examined. I have advised the Council that money spent in this direction will produce a return of untold value. Of course the Council will do this free of expense to the medical practitioner, and without the slightest publicity. Question 5.— Every practitioner will see the force of the literature being sent to him in order that he may give it to the patient. With this object it will be noticed that the precautions for phthisical patients are printed without the name of the Local Authority appearing on them. The Council as heretofore will disinfect rooms after every death from Phthisis, and at the change of residence of those so suffering, or whenever the medical man in attendance thinks such disinfection necessary. 45 No words from the Council of the Borough or from myself, I am sure, are necessary in praise of the splendid support the medical practitioners of the district have always given in respect to the notification of dangerous infectious diseases, and I feel satisfied that this support will be extended in regard to the voluntary notification of Phthisis. (Sigiied) G. Millson, Medical Officer of Health. WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 114 during the year, as against 98 for the year 1901. Although this number of deaths is an important increase on that of the previous year it is below the average for the last ten years. The annual rate per 1,000 living was .55. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years:— 1893 203 1899 93 1894 1ll 1899 146 1895 122 1900 120 1896 140 1901 98 1897 126 1902 114 TYPHUS FEVER. No death from this disease occurred in the Borough during the year and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 164, as against 161 for the preceding year. The Wards most affected were St. Peter, St. John, All Saints, St. Michael and St. George; the five Wards having the largest number of persons to the acre. The annual rate per 1,000 living was .79. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years 1893 75 1898 145 1894 229 1899 171 1895 198 1900 116 1896 192 1901 161 1897 184 1902 164 46 In all cases of Measles, Whooping Cough, and other non-notifiable diseases in which information has been sent to the Medical Officer of Health from the schools in the Borough, or on receipt of information from other sources, it has been our practice for a woman Inspector to visit at once and inspect the premises and to give such advice and instruction as is thought necessary to those in charge of the patient. In this kind of work it is impossible to say how much good is done by this woman Inspector. Personally, I believe much good can be done under suitable conditions. I am not prepared, however, to say that this work has been an unqualified success during the past year in this borough. These remarks, I wish to say, apply only to infectious disease and not to the other branches of work carried out by women Inspectors. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year 53 specimens were received and sent to Guy's Hospital for examination. 16 of these specimens were certified as having given positive results, whilst the results in the remaining 37 cases were certified as negative. ANTHRAX. Three cases of anthrax, two of which were in brushworkers using China hair, occurred during the year. The following letter was sent to all persons purchasing China, Russian, or Siberia hair from wholesale dealers in the Borough. All such hair is now disinfected free of charge at our station:— "Dear Sir, During the year several cases of anthrax which have occurred in this Borough have been traced to infection received in the manipulation of China hair. The enclosed bill setting out the symptoms of anthrax has been widely circulated, so that persons so infected may be alive to the necessity of early medical treatment. At the same time we are disinfecting all China hair sent on to us by the wholesale dealers in our Borough. I hear that you are interested in this matter. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, G. B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health." To 47 (Poster enclosed in Letter.) BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Department. To Brushmakers and Others working with China, Russian, and Siberian Hair. PRECAUTIONS AGAINST ANTHRAX. Anthrax is a fatal disease affecting certain animals, and may be conveyed from them to man by the manipulation of the hair of animals which have died of the disease. In China, Russia, and Siberia the disease is common, and infected hair (which does not differ from other hair in appearance) is often shipped to British ports. Hence in handling such hair, especially mane hair, care should be observed. The disease is usually communicated to man by the poison lodging in some point where the skin is broken, such as a fresh cut or a scratched pimple or even chapped hands. This happens most readily on the uncovered parts of the body—the hand, arm and face—but most frequently of all on the neck. Infection may also be brought about by rubbing or scratching a pimple with the hand or nail carrying the anthrax poison. The first symptom of anthrax is usually a small inflamed swelling like a pimple or boil, often quite painless, which extends and in a few days becomes black at the centre and surrounded by other pimples. The poison is then liable to be absorbed into the system and will cause risk to life. This can only be avoided by prompt and effective medical treatment in the early stage of the disease while the poison is still confined to the pimple. Hence it is of the utmost importance that a doctor should be at oncc consulted or the Medical Officer of Health should be communicated with if there is any suspicion of infection. G. B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Office, Borough Road. 48 DISINFECTION. The work carried out by the outdoor disinfecting staff during the year has been of a very heavy nature. During the Small-pox epidemic very close attention was given to the several common lodging houses; St. Olave's Chambers alone almost occupying the entire attention of one disinfector during the six months from February to July. The rooms of this lodging house were disinfected several times every week during that period. The following common lodging houses also were periodically disinfected during the continuance of the Small-pox epidemic:—99, Mint street; 67, Union street; 12, Marshalsea road; 12, Lombard street; 8, Great Charlotte street; and 96, Southwark street. The number of rooms disinfected during the year was 2797 as against 2184 for the year 1901. Tbese were distributed among the several wards as under:— TABLE 16. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected. St. Mary's Ward St. Paul's Ward. St. Peter's Ward. St. John's Ward. Trinity Ward. All Saint's Ward. St. Michael's Ward. St. Jude's Ward. St. George's Ward. Christchurch Ward. St. Saviour's Ward. Total. Number of Rooms Disinfected 275 233 240 277 297 235 460 145 310 165 160 2797 From time to time it was found necessary in consequence of the occurrence of infectious diseases to carry out special disinfection at various institutions in the Borough. This was done as follows:— Sandford Row Board Schools:—12 class rooms. Alvey House:—19 rooms (after Small-pox). St. Francis Hospital:—5 rooms. Princess of Wales Theatre:—The whole of the dressing rooms and back of stage. Newington Workhouse:—4 wards. St. Peter's Schools, Emerson Street:—Infants' department. It will be also seen from the following table that considerable pressure was put upon the staff at the Disinfecting Station, 45,328 articles being treated in the apparatus, as against 32,288 in the previous year:— 49 TABLE 17.

In addition to visits made by Sanitary Inspectors in relation to Infectious Diseases as set out in the above table, Mr. Powell, the Superintendent of the Reception House, was engaged in visiting "Contacts," and in arranging for the removal of all patients to Hospital. This work, which was of a very arduous nature, occupied the greater part of each day, whilst the remainder of his time was taken up in attending to the requirements of the Reception House. 51 RECEPTION HOUSE. The report of the work carried on at the Reception House during the first six months of the year, 1902, will be found in my report on the Small-pox epidemic, 1901-2, in the annual report for 1901. The number of families admitted in the second half of the year was above the average of former years. Not a single complaint has been made by any resident in relation to any matter, and therefore, we must infer that all the persons using the house were comfortable, and well pleased with the accommodation provided. The interior of the house was redecorated in the Autumn. The following table shews the number of persons accommodated in the Reception House during the year. 52 TABLE 19.

The Council on the 19th February considered the question of a more equitable adjustment of the districts of the Women Sanitary Inspectors (Houses Let in Lodgings) together with a re-arrangement of their duties (Miss Elliott, Inspector for No. 2 District, having been appointed Chief Woman Inspector on the 8th January). It was resolved— (a) That the Borough be divided into two districts by a line mencing at the boundary of the Borough at London Bridge, passing along Borough High Street, Newington Causeway and Walworth Road to the boundary of the Borough at Camberwell Gate. (b) That in future the Chief Woman Inspector be required to undertake the inspection of all premises in the Borough used as factories, workshops and workplaces, and to deal with all matters iu connection therewith as required by the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and that she also exercise a general supervision over such blocks of Tenement Houses in the Borough as the Public Health Committee may from time to time direct, and Houses Let in Lodgings. (c) That the two women Inspectors (Houses Let in Lodgings) be assigned a district each for the inspection of Houses Let in Lodgings, and such blocks of Tenement Houses in their respective districts as the Chief Woman Inspector may from time to time direct. (d) That Miss M. W. Richardson be appointed to the Eastern District and Miss E. Stewart to the Western District. At the commencement of the year 1902, the number of houses upon the register was 872. These were situate in the two districts of the Borough as follows:— In the East District 473 In the West District 399 Total 872 During the year I have at different dates represented a number of houses as being suitable for registration as houses let in lodgings. Of this number the Council resolved to place upon the register the following additional houses:— In the East District 77 houses, and in the West District 58 houses. 61 Date of Resolution of Council.

THE METROPOLITAN INDUSTRIAL DWELLINGS COMPANY, LIMITED. Ponsonby Buildings. The result of the Police Court proceedings in this case which were printed in the Sanitary Journal for October, 1902, was unfortunate for the Borough, as the Magistrate dismissed the summons with 10 guineas costs. After this decision the Public Health Committee of the Borough decided to call in Professor Robinson, whose report is here given. The effect of Professor Robinson's examination of the drainage was that the Industrial Dwellings Company without further delay reconstructed the entire system of drainage. I have given the history of the case from the Sanitary Journal, together with Professor Robinson's Report:— Extract fbom "Sanitary Journal." "The premises, Ponsonby Buildings, are in a square, and consist of a series of blocks, backing on to a large court-yard. The outlet of the main drain is on one side of the buildings, under which it passes to the courtyard. From the courtyard branches pass from the main drain under the several passages to the closets. "In February last application was made to the Medical Officer of Health for a certificate under the Inland Revenue Act. The drains of the premises were 'Kemp' tested, and were found to be defective. Thereupon the Medical Officer of Health requested the Sanitary Inspector to water-test the drains, in order that the certificate might include everything. An attempt was made to water-test them. A hose-pipe was put on, and according to the computation of the fire-engine authorities about 15,000 gallons of water were passed into the drains. It was utterly useless to try to fill the drain because the water would not rise higher than the entrance to the chambers leading to the blocks. A deal of correspondence was carried on between the Medical Officer of Health and the Secretary to the Company holding the blocks, and eventually the case was brought into Court. In addition to the defective condition of the drains, the Inspector found that at the top of the buildings the flats were used as drying grounds, and the sink waste-pipes, which also did service as rain-water pipes, had open ends at the top of the buildings, emitting very foul smells, complained of by the tenants wheu using the places for drying, &c. The Borough Council Officers prescribed that traps should be placed at the top of the pipes and the pipes then continued upwards for ventilating purposes. Upon coming into Court, the whole of the facts were laid before the Magistrate (Mr. Paul Taylor), and the Dwellings 87 Company were represented by Mr. Courthope-Munroe. In course of examination, the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Grist, fully showed that the drains were defective upon 'Kemp-testing.' It was also stated that complaint was received from the tenants of the foul smells issuing from the waste-pipes. Mr. Grist, after giving evidence upon the 'Kemptesting,' also described the manner in which the attempt was made to fill the drains for water-testing. Mr. Long, Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark, stated that he had examined the premises and could corroborate the statements made by the previous witness. For the defendants, Counsel called Dr. Wynter-Blyth to give evidence. He asked Dr. Blyth whether he was the Chairman of the Sanitary Institute, &c., and had had vast experience in drainage aud other sanitary matters. He was further asked by Counsel whether he had examined these premises; he stated that he had, and could find no nuisance. He stated that the trap which the Borough Council were asking the owner to provide would only create the nuisance they were seeking to abate. He was then asked by the Magistrate whether it was a fair thing to apply the water-test to old drains? and he stated, 'No.' Upon cross-examination by Mr. Long, he admitted that the area over which the test was applied had nothing to do with pressure upon the joints, and that it was simply a matter of vertical height of the column. Then upon being asked what would be the pressure in this case upon the joints of the pipes? he said, 'He did not know.' Mr. Long stated, 'Of course you are an expert in this matter, you are an examiner of Sanitary Inspectors, and if I tell you the height of the column was not more than 2ft. 6in., can you not tell me the pressure per square inch upon the joints?' He said, 'No, he could not.' Mr. Long also said, 'Is it a fact that you do not regard a leaky drain as a defective one?' 'Not always,' he said; 'allowance has to be made for the age of the drain.' Mr. Long replied, 'I am sorry for Marylebone, then!' And further asked, 'Would it not be a fair thing to do to charge the drain with water up to the point at which it would be charged if it became choked in the ordinary way? 'Dr. Blyth's reply was indefinite. And again, 'Would it not be a fact that if the drain became choked in any way that the sewage matter would percolate into the surrounding soil?' Dr. Blyth replied, 'If the joints were broken, certainly.' The Counsel for the defence then addressed the Magistrate, urging that the Borough Council had behaved very unfairly in the matter by forcing the joints of the drains and then going into Court and complaining of nuisance, which they themselves had created. The Magistrate, in summing up, said that it was very hard upon property owners that their drains should be water- 88 tested, which had been shown to be unfair by evidence, and he thought that the present defendant had very good ground for complaining; he should, therefore, dismiss the summonses. Whereupon Counsel asked for 10 guineas costs, which were granted by the Magistrate." Note.—The matter was fully reported on by Mr. Long to his Committee, and he advised them to exercise their authority under the Metropolis Local Management Act and Public Health Act to go in and uncover the drains for examination, and the Committee passed a resolution instructing him to do so. Two cases of infectious disease happened in one of the blocks a few days afterwards. The drains were again " Kemp " tested, Mr. Long and the Inspector both being present, and were found extremely offensive. Whereupon Mr. Long gave written notice to the occupier that after the expiration of twenty-four hours he was coming in with workmen to uncover the drains. The defendant, having heard that notice had been served on the occupier, was there first with workmen to uncover the drain, and found that it was defective in every joint so far as it was uncovered. REPORT OF PROFESSOR ROBINSON. (The plans and drawings referred to have not been reproduced for this Report). PONSONBY BUILDINGS. Parliament Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster, S.W. November 24th, 1902. The Health Committee of the Borough of Southwark. Gentlemen, In accordance with the instructions of Dr. Millson, your Medical Officer, I have made a careful examination ot the sanitary condition of Ponsonby Buildings, the result of which I beg to report to you. Ponsonby Buildings contain 160 tenements, the occupants at present numbering 461 persons. The general arrangement for draining the different tenements is shown on the accompanying drawing A. The water closets connect into 5in. iron soil pipes (each taking five closets) which run up the face of the buildings to a height of between 7 and 8 feet above the floor of the roof, which is flat, and is surrounded by a 5ft. parapet. These flats are used for washing and drying purposes, the children playing there. At the ground line the soil pipes are 89 connected to an inspection chamber by 6in. stoneware pipes. In some cases these pipes run under the floors of the buildings. The rain water from the roofs is conveyed by 3in. iron pipes to 4in. stoneware trapped gullies. From these it is carried to the inspection chamber by 4in. stoneware pipes, which also in some cases run under the floors of the buildings. There are heads on the rain water pipes at each floor level to take the waste from the sinks, each pipe taking five sinks. The inspection chambers are connected by 6in. stoneware pipes to a 9in. stoneware main drain from which they are trapped in every case, except the one from the inspection chamber, marked R on drawing A, which has no trap. The traps used are of an ordinary intercepting type with an "eye" for cleaning as shown on figure 3, but the stoppers have been removed in every case as shown by figure 4, so that the object of trapping is not fulfilled. I applied water tests and also smoke tests to several of the blocks of tenements, and will deal with each test in detail. Water test made on November 13th to Block Nos. 81 to 100. I applied a water test to the 6in. stoneware drains marked C and D, on drawing A, which pass under the floor of the building. A section on drawing B. shows the fall between the w.c. pan on the ground floor (where the water was put in) and the inspection chamber. The head was 2.92 feet, giving a pressure of about 1½ lbs. per square inch. The amount of water which each length of drain would contain, provided no leaks occurred, would be about 34½ gallons. I had the water for the tests put into the pipes in pails of 3 gallon capacity, by which the leakage could be calculated, and it was found to be at the rate of 240 gallons per hour from the pipe marked C., and practically the same leakage occurred from pipe D. The inspection chamber for this block (marked R. on drawing A.) was in a very bad state of repair, large cracks being found in the cement rendering on the floor, and in the benching between the channels. The joints between the pipes entering the chamber and the channelling were in some cases open, liquid could be seen running freely down these cracks. I had some colouring matter introduced into these two pipes in order to trace if there was any connection through the subsoil between the pipes. I established such a connection between the pipes marked B. and D1., on drawing A., the latter being the 4in. pipe from the rain water gulley. This occurred close to the chamber, and was discovered when the stopper was removed, the coloured liquid flowing freely from the 4in. pipe. 90 The Company's men had commenced work on the repairs to the pipes of this block before I could test by smoke. I endeavoured to obtain a water test on the inspection chamber, but the water leaked away so rapidly that no gaugings could be secured. The inspection chamber was connected to the 9in. main drain by a Gin. pipe, and as before mentioned, without any trap. I could not trace any fresh air inlet to this chamber. I examined some of the water closets and sinks, finding many of them leaky. The closets are flushed by 2 and 3 gallon tanks, adjusted to a 2 gallon flush, the flush in most cases being unsatisfactory owing to bends in the down pipes, and to the bad adjustment of the tanks. I found that several of the tanks leaked into the closet pans, and that some of the sinks were not properly jointed to the traps. The water closets had no provision for anti-syphonage pipes when orginally fixed, and even now the Company are putting new ones in without providing anti-syphonage pipes. The necessity for having them is universally recognised, and the London County Council's printed By-laws expressly provide for them. Without such a provision the seals of the traps of a series of w.c.'s are certain to be broken by the partial vacuum caused in the soil pipe when the discharges from the w.c's practically fill the soil pipe. Figures 1 and 2, show closets with and without the provision for anti-syphonage pipes. On the 15th I was able to inspect the pipes C and D where the Company's men had uncovered them. The top joints were apparently sound but roughly made. The joints at the invert were faulty, allowing the sewage to leak into the subsoil (under the passage) which was black and wet. Tests applied to Block Nos. 121-—140 made November 15th. I applied water and smoke tests to this block with the following results:— The 6in. pipes marked X and Y, on drawing A, were tested with water in the same manner as the previous block was tested. The head was however greater, being 3.87ft., or a pressure of 1.9 lbs. per square inch. The leakage from the pipe marked X was practically at the rate of 240 gallons per hour and 455 gallons per hour from the pipe marked Y. I also tested the 6in. pipes L and Z with water, and found the leakage from L was at the rate of 360 gallons per hour, and 4 gallons per 91 hour from Z. I then applied a water test to the 4in. pipes carrying the rain water and sink wastes (marked 1 and 2 on drawing A). The leakage from the former was at the rate of 540 gallons per hour, and the latter leaked, but the amount was not gauged. I was informed by your Inspector, Mr. Grist, that the pipes marked Z Y and 2 had recently been relaid. The head of water applied to the pipes 1 and 2 was 3.29ft., or 1.6 lbs. per square inch. On November 17th I had a smoke test applied to this block by four smoke "rockets" placed in the inspection chamber. The soil pipes were not plugged at their outlets. No trace of the smoke could be found in the building itself, but the fumes issued from the top of the soil pipes on the flat roof and were blown on to the flat. This shows that the foul air from the main and branch drains can be breathed by the people when on the flat roof. The soil pipes being on both sides of the flat, whichever way the wind sets, foul air from one or other would be likely to blow down on to the people. The inspection chamber has recently been repaired, but was not in a satisfactory condition. A 4in. stoneware pipe had been provided and connected to a grid in the wall of the building about 8ft. from the ground. This evidently was intended for a fresh air inlet, but had no mica flap on it. No smoke issued from this grid. I applied a smoke test to the manhole in Charles Street (numbered M.H.B. on drawing A). This manhole was provided with a fresh air inlet with mica flap. The smoke issued in large quantities from this inlet which was about 5ft. from the windows. Water Test and Inspection of Main Drain. On November 14th and 15th I had four holes sunk on to the 9in. main drain at the points O, M, P, H. It was found to be stoneware, badly laid and roughly jointed. At the point O, where the two 6in. pipes join the main drain, I found the 6in. pipe from chamber R cracked and the next length patched. At the point H the joints on the invert of the pipes were very faulty. A blade of a pen-knife was inserted, and when withdrawn brought back fine black mud. The tops of the joints were apparently sound. The results from the other holes were the same, but at the point M a joint recently made was exposed and apparently sound and well made. This, I believe, was the part relaid when the manhole marked A was put in. The soil under the pipes and joints was black and wet, a sample taken at the hole marked H containing worms. 92 The earth above the pipes was "made ground" consisting of earth and brick rubbish. From manhole A to manhole B a Gin. iron pipe has been introduced with a gradient of 1 in 28.44. A section is shown on drawing B which gives the gradient of the 9in. drain. I tested the 9in. main stoneware drain from manhole A, heading the water back, and the following table shows the leakage at different heads showing that the pipe is in a very faulty state. Table of Leakage from Main Drain. Time in minutes. Head of water in feet. Leakage in gallons per hour. 1 3.53 853 2 3.20 698 3 2.93 599 4 2.70 388 5 2.55 233 6 2.46 104 7 2.42 155 8 2.36 155 9 2.30 52 10 2.28 207 The leakage would be considerably more than these figures show, because while the tests were being made the sewage was not stopped from entering the drain. The last five readings show that large volumes of sewage entered the pipe at the time the readings were taken. The water level could be seen rising and falling. Tests applied to Block Nos. 1—20 made on November 17th. I applied both smoke and water tests to this block with the following results:— The smoke test revealed the same state of affairs as existed in Block Nos. 121—140. The w.c.'s, sinks and flushing tanks were in a similar state to those in the other blocks. I applied the water test to the drains and the leakage observed was as follows :— The 6in. pipes marked A and B on drawing A had a head of 3.5ft., equal to 1¾lbs. per square inch. The pipe A leaked at the rate of 270 gallons per hour, and the pipe B at the rate of 144 gallons per hour. 93 The leakage from the 6in. pipes marked 5 and 6 (which had the same head as A and B) was 84 gallons per hour for the former and 120 gallons per hour for the latter. A leaking joint was found at the point marked T, the water running out on to the pavement. I applied the water test to the 4in. pipes marked 7 and 8 and found them both leaking badly. I have read a report of the evidence that was given before the Magistrate when the case was heard, and can say that the water test affords the only way of ascertaining whether a house drain is sound or not. This applies equally to old as to new drains. The age of a drain has nothing to do with the matter as the joints of a stoneware drain do not become affected by time. The view that "it is unfair" to apply the water test to old drains is an extraordinary one, and is at variance with everyday practice. It is usual to apply a water test of from 3 to 5ft. head (about 1½ to 2½lbs. per square inch) according to the levels of the drain, as the pressure represents what the drain would have to stand in the event of its becoming blocked. Figures 6 and 7 show two joints taken out by the Company's men. Figure 5 is an example showing how a well laid pipe should be jointed. In conclusion, I may say that all the pipes subjected to the water test failed entirely, even those recently relaid or repaired by the Company's men. The closets now being put in are defective owing to their not being provided with anti-syphonage pipes. The arrangement of fresh air inlets and ventilation to the drains is bad. The inspection chambers are extremely faulty. The result of my investigation leads me to express an opinion that Ponsonby Buildings are not in a sanitary condition. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, HENRY ROBINSON, M.Inst.C.E." "Emeritus,'' Professor of Civil Engineering, King's College, London. 94 UNSOUND FOOD. Close attention has been given during the past year to all the market places in the Borough, and the following is a record of the proceedings taken by the Ward Inspectors:— ST. MARY'S WARD. Newington Butts.—12 boxes unsound tomatoes exposed for sate; condemned, and ordered by Magistrate to be destroyed. Newington Butts.—3¼cwt. unsound tomatoes; seized and destroyed. Steedman Street.—¾ cwt. unsound fish; seized aud destroyed. ST. PAUL'S WARD. Otto Street.—A quantity of unsound fish; destroyed by consent of owner. Walworth Road.—A quantity of unsound mushrooms exposed for sale on a stall; seized; condemned by a Magistrate, and ordered to be destroyed. The owner was fined 20/- and 4/- costs. Camberwell Road. — A quantity of unsound smoked herrings; destroyed by consent of owner. ST. PETER'S WARD. East Street.—Two bushels unsound apples; destroyed by consent of owner. Burton Street.—24 boxes unsound pears ; condemned, and destroyed. ST. JOHN'S WARD. New Kent Road.—Three unsound rabbits exposed for sale; seized; condemned by a Magistrate, and ordered to be destroyed. The owner was fined £5 and 2/- costs for the offence. TRINITY WARD. Borough High Street.—Five tins preserved peas (from a large stock examined) found to be unsound; seized, and condemned by a Magistrate. The owner was fined £10 and 4/- costs. ST. JUDE'S WARD. St. George's Road.—A tin of salmon which was brought to the Public Health Office, was found to be in a very putrid condition, and was condemned by a Magistrate. The tin had been purchased at a shop in the St. George's Road. The shop was visited by the Inspector, and the whole of the stock of tinned fish examined, but no further unsound 95 specimens were found. Under these circumstances it was thought inadvisable to take out a summons in respect to the solitary tin brought under our notice. CHRISTCHURCH WARD. Blackfriars Goods Station.—Five tons unsound potatoes condemned, and destroyed by consent. Blackfriars Goods Station.—In consequence of a complaint, a quantity of cheese was examined and found to be damaged but perfectly sound and fit for human food. ST. SAVIOUR'S WARD. Borough Market.—18 boxes tomatoes found to be unsound, and destroyed by consent of owners. Borough Market.—In consequence of a complaint, the whole of the fruit belonging to Mr. J. J. Levy was examined and found to be sound. Borbugh Market.- 40 bags turnips found to be unsound, and destroyed by consent of owners. Borough Market.—13 bags onions found to be unsound, and destroyed by consent of owners. Clink Wharf.—In consequence of information received at the Public Health Office, the Inspector (Mr. Cook) attended at Clink Wharf and examined a consignment of 450 cases each containing 10 tins of apricot pulp. He found 570 tins out of a total of 4500 examined to be unfit for human food. These 570 tins of apricot pulp, weighing 2 tons 15 cwt., were accordingly removed with the consent of the owner and destroyed. Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company's Premises.—A lighter laden with cases containing tins of condensed milk returned from abroad discharged its cargo at the above premises. The milk was stated to be in a suspiciously unsound condition. A large number of tins were examined by the Medical Officer of Health and Mr. Cook, and an arrangement was made for the whole consignment to be immediately sent down the country where the milk was to be used as pigs' food. The local health authorities were notified and watched the disposal of the milk. 96 ICE CREAMS. The following notice in regard to the manufacture, storage, &c., of ice creams was issued by the London County Council. Copies of the notice were exhibited in conspicuous parts of the Borough, and a copy was left at all premises where such business is carried on. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Ice Creams. The London County Council hereby gives notice that Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which will come into operation on 1st November, 1902, provides as follows:— Any person being a manufacturer of or merchant or dealer in ice creams or other similar commodity who within the County— (a) Causes or permits ice creams or any similar commodity to be manufactured sold or stored in any cellar shed or room in which there is any inlet or opening to a drain or which is used as a living room or sleeping room; (b) In the manufacture sale or storage of any such commodity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination; or (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst the persons employed in his business or living or working in on or about the premises in or on any part of which any such commodity as aforesaid is manufactured sold or stored to give notice thereof forthwith to the Medical Officer of the Sanitary District in which such business is carried on or such premises are situate; shall be liable for every such offence on conviction in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. Every itinerant vendor of any such commodity as aforesaid shall if not himself the manufacturer thereof exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow a notice stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such commodity and if such vendor is himself the manufacturer of such commodity he shall in the same manner exhibit his own name and address. Every such itinerant vendor who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Section shall be liable for each offence on conviction as aforesaid to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. 97 Proceedings for the recovery of the penalties shall be instituted by the Sanitary Authority for the District in which the offence was committed or of the District to the Medical Officer of which such notification as aforesaid ought to have been made or in which such itinerant vendor as aforesaid shall offer any such commodity as aforesaid for sale as the case may be. G. L. Gomme, Clerk of the Council. Spring Gardens, S.W., 11th September, 1902. Special attention has been given to the places where Ice Cream is manufactured and stored. The following table shows the proceedings taken in each Ward by the Inspectors. In every instance where it was found that the premises were unsuitable for the manufacture or storing of Ice Cream, a notice was served specifying the works necessary to be carried out in order to render the premises suitable, and these works were duly carried out or the making of Ice Cream discontinued altogether.

There are at the present time 126 bakehouses in the Borough. Of this number 76 are above ground, or "level" bakehouses, as they are termed by the trade, whilst 50 are underground, according to the description in Section 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. For years past considerable attention has been given to improving the structural and administrative condition of bakehouses. There is scarcely a bakehouse in the Borough that has not been provided with an impervious floor, impervious walls, and casters on all the dough troughs, together with good means of ventilation. During the present year further improvement in underground bakehouses has been made. UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. The following minimum requirements for underground bakehouses, after much consideration and after several interviews between the Public Health Committee and the Association of Master Bakers, were assented to by the Council. Notice was subsequently given to the tenants and owners of underground bakehouses in the district that certificates would be required in all cases after January 1st, 1904, and that such certificates would be withheld, and the underground bakehouses closed, unless the minimum requirements decided upon by the Council were complied with. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. An underground bakehouse shall not be used as such after January 1st, 1904, unless such underground bakehouse be, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, suitable and fit on sanitary grounds for use or occupation as a bakehouse, as shown by possessing the following minimum sanitary requirements:— A.—Construction. (1) The underground bakehouse shall be of a minimum capacity of 1000 cubic feet, and shall be in every part thereof at least 8ft. high, measured from the floor to the ceiling, beams and joists excepted, unless provided with daylight area or areas, at least 3ft. wide and easily accessible, extending below the floor level and directly communicating with the external air and not glazed over, into which at least one window of such underground bakehouse opens. 126 (2) The walls shall be made, and kept at all times, smooth and impervious throughout, so that the underground bakehouse is free from damp. (3) The ceilings shall be properly ceiled, and kept at all times impervious to dust, or, if made of brick, rendered smooth. (4) The floors shall be made with at least 6in. concrete, rendered smooth in cement, or with other jointless, or impervious paving throughout, so that the underground bakehouse is free from damp. (5) Any drain or sewer under the bakehouse shall be constructed of gas and water-tight pipes. No gully shall be within the bakehouse, unless the pipe connected therewith be made to discharge over a trapped inlet outside the bakehouse. (6) Provision shall be made for safe and suitable means of access to the bakehouse. B.—Light. (7) The underground bakehouse shall be provided with one or more windows, opening directly into the external air above the ground level, or into an area or areas directly communicating with the external air and not glazed over, so as to be properly lighted by the admission of daylight—such window or windows shall have a total superficies, clear of the sash frames equal to at least one-twelfth of the floor space of the underground bakehouse, and shall be so constructed as to exclude the entrance of street dust, and wherever artificial light is used such light shall be if practicable, electric light. C.— Ventilation. (8) The underground bakehouse shall be properly and effectually ventilated by permanent inlets and outlets (other than the window or windows), communicating directly with the open air, but in such a way, and at such a height above the street level, as to prevent, as far [as possible, the entrance into the underground bakehouse of street dust and dirt; the inlets and outlets shall be of proper prescribed sizes; and, further, such openings shall not be under the control of the persons employed. One of the openings shall be situated in the ceiling and the other at such a height as to deliver the air upwards without draughts, so as to ensure 127 a constant and equable temperature. Where natural ventilation is not effective, or in the opinion of the Medical Officer is insufficient, ventilation by fans, or other artificial means, shall be provided. D.—All Other Respects. (9) Dough troughs, and other furniture, or fittings (if any) shall be mounted on strong casters, or wheels, so as to be readily movable for cleansing purposes, or, where fixed, shall be raised at least one foot from the floor, and set sufficiently away from all walls, so as to allow of access to all parts. (10) There shall not be in direct communication with the bakehouse, any coal or other cellar, room (unless provided with a dust-proof door), unpaved yard, or area, which may be a nuisance, or cause contamination by foul air, dust or dirt. (11) Provision shall be made for the proper storage of flour elsewhere than in the bakehouse itself. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL BAKEHOUSES. A.—Structural. (1) Every room or place used as a bakehouse shall be in such a state as to be, on sanitary grounds, fit for use in occupation as a bakehouse. (2) No water-closet, earth-closet, privy or ashpit shall be within, or communicate directly with, the bakehouse. (3) Every cistern for supplying water to the bakehouse shall be separate and distinct from any cistern for supplying water to a water-closet. (4) No drain or pipe for carrying off fiscal or sewage matter shall have an opening within the bakehouse. (5) All the inside walls of the rooms of a bakehouse, and all the ceilings or tops of the rooms (whether those walls, ceilings or tops are plastered or not), and all the passages and staircases of a bakehouse, shall be either painted with oil or varnished, or be limewashed, or be partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed; and (a) Where the bakehouse is painted with oil or varnished, there must be three coats of paint or varnish, and the paint or varnish must be renewed once at least in every seven years, and must be washed with hot water and soap once at least in six months; and 128 (b) Where the bakehouse is limewashed, the limewashing must be renewed once at leist in every six months. (6) No place on the same level with a bakehouse, and forming part of the same building, shall be used as a sleeping place, unless it is constructed as follows, that is to say:— (a) is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a tition extending from the floor to the ceiling; and (b) has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which, at least, four and a half superficial feet are made to open for ventilation; and unless such sleeping room (if separately occupied) comply with the requirements as to underground rooms (so occupied) laid down in the Public Health Acts. B.—Administrative. (1) The bakehouse shall be kept at all times periodically cleansed, and in a cleanly state, and free from offensive effluvia arising from drains, w.c.'s, urinals, or other nuisance.
