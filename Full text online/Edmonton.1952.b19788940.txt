Snary PREFACE Public Health Department, Town Hall, Edmonton, N.9. His Worship the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Edmonton. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1952 on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The Report is compiled in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health Circular 2/53. Death Rate.—Shows a slight reduction compared with 1951. Birth Rate.—Is slightly lower than last year. Infantile Mortality Rate.—Has now reached the new low level of 14.85. This is a truly remarkable figure, and reflects great credit on the doctors, midwives and health visitors engaged in this most meritorious work. The Neo-Natal Rate is also down. Maternal Mortality Rate.—Is 0.72 compared with 0.71 in 1951. Tuberculosis.-—The incidence of this disease has shown a gradual increase over the past ten years, but the death rate from Tuberculosis is declining. The increased incidence is in part due to better facilities for diagnosis, and in part to the desire of the patient to come forward for treatment. A word may be mentioned here about Clinic accommodation in this area. The Chest Clinic is located in a terrace-type house, converted for this purpose—the ground floor for Clinic purposes and the remainder for Welfare and Clerical accommodation. 5 Converted buildings for clinical purposes are nearly always unsuitable. The work in the Edmonton Clinic has increased threefold since it was opened many years ago, and only one small hut has been added since then. It is time a new building was established for this very important health service. The state of health in Edmonton continues to be satisfactory. Over a number of years the Statistical Record of the Borough shows an increasing advance from year to year. This advance has been very rapid since World War II and may be attributed to two main factors:— (1) The increased and continued efforts made by your Officers, and the co-ordinated team work of the various sections; the one with the other, and, (2) The uprooting of established prejudices consequent on bringing large sections of the community together. This has brought home to some individuals that it is as easy in the long run to do the right thing the right way than to do it the wrong way. It was a practical lesson in Health Education. The Public Health Medical Officers, Health Visitors, Midwives and Sanitary Inspectors should be trained more in Health Education than these Officers have hitherto been. A great deal has already been done but the range of Health Education must become wider and wider rather than confining our attention to our own particular section. Public Health Officers have excellent opportunities to influence those with whom they come in contact in health matters. These Officers must be trained in their methods of approach as well as being fully conversant with the subject matter which they wish to put across. The modern Medical Officer of Health must not only be trained according to the Statutes and Orders laid down by the Ministry, but must also be a teacher. To understand fully the Social and Public Health Services some fundamental knowledge of government, both local and central, is necessary. As headlines, a knowledge of Population and Vital Statistics are also necessary. 6 Vital Statistics are becoming increasingly important in as much as the wrong conclusion can be as easily reached as the right one. Their correlation with social developments and scientific progress are very helpful in the hands of the expert. In order to bring about this co-ordinated effort for the success of the National Health Service Act, a knowledge of the structure of the Health Services, and the role of our co-workers in the field of health, both official and voluntary, is necessary. There are many barriers in the way of this objective because the Act itself is divided into three great sections, and the Local Health Authorities have further divided these sections into smaller departments, all very frequently working independently of one another. The School Health Service frequently comes in for some unjustifiable criticism by people who should know better. Over the passage of years the School Health Service has fully justified itself. The British system has been compared, unfavourably, with the American system. It is generally accepted that the American School Health Service is not as advanced as ours, and the American Journal of Public Health states that this matter is receiving attention. It is true that wider authority for our own Medical Officers is necessary, otherwise delay is experienced in bringing about the simplest remedy. Housing in Edmonton is now beginning to receive attention. The ageing property in Beaconsfield Road dealt with during this year was long overdue, and it is to be hoped that quite a lot of other similar property will receive attention in the near future. Housing is a very important health factor to a community. It would appear, however, that the need is endless. The general public is now becoming interested in the question of re-conditioning old property, on account of the publicity given to the Croydon and Stockton-on-Tees experiments. Quite a large number of houses in Edmonton which are in fairly good condition, architecturally, but at the same time do not possess the amenities of a modern house, could be dealt with in this manner. Search should begin immediately for such property and the owners informed of the facilities available for assistance. 7 Environmental Hygiene is becoming more and more important in the Public Health Service. This has its natural reflection in the training of personnel, and it is therefore necessary if we are to ensure a satisfactory job that a more comprehensive curriculum be arranged for Sanitary Inspectors. The D.P.H. candidate is deflected more into the realms of medicine; and environmental training, which is so important to health, is becoming neglected or left to others to do. It is therefore important that more attention should be given to the environment of the individual. The Sanitary Inspector needs more fundamental knowledge of building and plumbing. A knowledge of these subjects is required in the present curriculum, but the time is now ripe for the S.I. candidate to sit for an examination such as the Building Inspector's examination of the Institute of Municipal Engineers. I wish to record my thanks to the members of my staff for their loyal support and assistance throughout the year. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the members of the Public Health Committee and the Council, for their continued support during the past year. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, D. REGAN, Medical Officer of Health. 8 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 3,896 Population— Census of 1921 66,809 Census of 1931 77,652 Census of 1951 104,244 Estimated by the Registrar-General for mid-year 1952 102,600 Number of inhabited houses and separate dwellings at the end of 1952 28,652 Number of inhabited houses and separate dwellings at the end of 1951 28,564 Rateable value, April, 1952 . £750,221 Estimated product of 1d. in the £ for the year ending March 31st, 1953 £3,015 Rates in the £ for the year ending March 31st, 1953 19s. 11d.

Eighty-three samples of Designated Milks were examined during 1952. Results were as follows:— Pasteurised Milk. 45 Samples were examined. 10 Samples satisfied both the prescribed tests. 35 Samples failed to pass the Methylene Blue test. (34 of these results may be disregarded in view of the rise in temperature to above 65° F.) Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) Milk. 19 Samples were examined. 5 Samples satisfied both the prescribed tests. 14 Samples failed the Methylene Blue test, but the results may be disregarded in view of the rise in temperature to above 65° F. Tuberculin Tested Milk. 2 Samples were examined and satisfied the prescribed tests. Sterilised Milk. 17 Samples were examined and all passed the Turbidity test. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. The water supply of the Borough has at all times been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. The Metropolitan Water Board is responsible for the supply which is piped direct to every dwelling-house throughout the Borough, and serves the entire population. The co-operation of the Board has at all times been of the fullest. SANITARY INSPECTION IN THE AREA. Seven District Sanitary Inspectors and one woman Sanitary Inspector are engaged in the sanitary supervision of the Borough, working under the supervision of the Senior Sanitary Inspector. The Senior Sanitary Inspector supervises the work of the Borough. 16 Sanitary Conveniences. Consideration has been given to the question of the free use of w.c.s in the Council's public conveniences, and it was decided, for an experimental period, that in one convenience at a time, no charge be made for the use of the w.c.s. So far the experiment has proved satisfactory. Rodent Control. Under this heading your Senior Sanitary Inspector, as Officer-in-Charge, Rodent Control, reported as follows: — The Council have an Assistant Rodent Officer, two Rodent Operators, the part-time services of a Clerk and appointed the District Sanitary Inspectors as Rodent Officers. During the year the treatment of business premises by " Warfarin " has proved very successful. The new method of rodent control has the advantage that the materials are undetectable by rats and mice, therefore poison shyness does not occur, and the rodents continue to feed until all are dead. Further, no prebaiting is necessary and the baiting is continuous. " Warfarin " destroys the ability of the blood to clot and the rats become weaker and die painlessly from internal haemorrhage. The District Sanitary Inspectors in cases where there was a possibility of the infestation being due to defective drainage visited the premises and tested the drainage and any defects discovered were dealt with through the usual channels. In 80 per cent of the cases defects were discovered and as one can quite appreciate entailed quite a large amount of work. The following table gives details of the work carried out during the year. 1. Prevalence of Rats and Mice.

During the year maintenance treatments of the sewers took place by the Borough Engineer's Department, and I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following report: — Rat Destruction in Sewers, 1952/53. The 11th and 12th Maintenance treatments were carried out in 1952, commencing in April and October, respectively, and the results were as follows: — 11th Treatment 12th Treatment No. of Manholes baited 1,122 1,132 Total prebait takes 495 547 Complete prebait takes 210 266 Total poison takes 467 533 It will be seen that the total "takes" are approximately 45% to 50% of the number of manholes baited. A map of the streets showing "takes" is prepared for each treatment and the inference drawn from these maps is that distribution of the rat population in sewers is steady and no migratory movement can be observed. The results of the last four treatments appear to support the Ministry's theory that sewer treatment as at present carried out, can only succeed in preventing increase in the existing rat population. It is too early yet to say whether new types of surface treatments will have any affect on the sewer population. Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, Section 11. Section II of this Act, which relates to Hawkers of Food and their Premises,came into operation on the 1st of April, 1951. Two persons and their premises were registered during the year, and two persons were registered to trade in the Borough where storage premises are located in other districts. Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts 1920-1933 During the year no certificates under the above Acts were issued. 18 Disinfection and Disinfestation. The following table gives some idea of the work carried out:— Number of journeys to collect bedding 301 „ „ return bedding 304 Rooms disinfected after infectious disease 354 „ „ „ phthisis 49 „ „ „ other cases 36 vermin 344 Bedding, clothing, etc., disinfected after infectious disease 3,741 articles „ „ „ „ „ phthisis 400 „ „ „ „ „ „ other cases 2,323 „ „ „ „ „ „ vermin 367 „ The Council distribute a disinfecting powder and fluid to residents who apply for same at the Town Hall Yard. During the year, the applicants numbered 6,802. One hour daily is allowed for such distribution with the exception of Fridays and Saturdays. A Formalin Chamber is used for the disinfection of books, leather goods, etc., articles that would be damaged by steam. The number of books and other articles thus disinfected was 813. Twenty-two Council properties and 100 other houses were found to be infested, the total number of rooms disinfested was 344. The whole of the work is carried out by the Department, the materials used being insecticides containing D.D.T. as a base. Petroleum (Regulations) Acts, 1928 and 1936. During the year 10 new licences and 107 renewals were granted by the Council. The following is a list of particulars of quantities, etc., affected by these licences:— Petroleum spirit 426,869 galls. Petroleum mixtures (cellulose) 11,763 „ Carbide of calcium 200 lb. Rubber solution 100 lb. + 850 galls. Mortuary. During the year 16 bodies were deposited in the Mortuary, 6 by order of the Coroner, 10 for sanitary reasons. Inspections.

The Shops Acts and Street Trading Inspector submits a monthly report to the Public Health Committee, and the following is a short summary of the work carried out during the year. Visits to Shops, Licensed Street Traders, etc 1,301 Washing facilities, sink water heaters installed 30 Contraventions were in the main of a minor character, mostly concerned with the exhibition of notices. Shops Act, 1950 Section 17(1) Conditions of Employment Provisions as to assistants' half-holiday. Letters of warning were sent to the occupiers of 4 shops where assistants were found working during the occasion of their weekly half-holiday. Shops Act 1950—Sunday Trading Twenty-nine shops were visited in addition to supervisory operations and observations. Two contraventions were discovered; letters of warning were sent. Registers required to be kept under this Act were inspected periodically. Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938 Cinemas and Boot and Shoe Repairing are the only occupations where young persons are being employed under the above Act. The Registers kept at these premises were perodically inspected. Middlesex County Council Act, 1944-1950. Street Trading.—Legal proceedings were instituted by the Council in three cases during 1952, the summons against one being dismissed. Summonses were issued in connection with the other two and fines totalling £3 1s. Od. were imposed. The inspection of shops, stalls and other traders' premises coming within the scope of the Acts has been carried out throughout the year, including Sundays and evenings. PREVALENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Measles and Whooping Cough. These diseases were made compulsorily notifiable in October, 1939, 1,036 cases of Measles and 8 cases of Whooping Cough were notified during the year. There were no deaths from these diseases. Diphtheria. No cases were notified during the year; two cases were notified in 1951. 28 Scarlet Fever. Continued to occur throughout the year in a mild form. There were 318 cases compared with 189 in 1951; there were no deaths. "Return" cases numbered four, allowing for an interval of 28 days between a patient returning home from the Isolation Hospital and the onset of the disease in another inmate of the house. Smallpox. No cases of smallpox were notified during the year. Enteric Fever. Several hundred Army Cadets from the London Area attended camp at Felixstowe between 28th July and 10th August, 1952. An Edmonton lad from the local contingent was admitted to hospital on 24th August and was subsequently diagnosed to be suffering from Paratyphoid "B." Following receipt of this information contact was made with the Ministry of Health, the Medical Officer of Health, Felixstowe, Secretary of the Middlesex Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Association, and the Commanding Officer of the Edmonton T.A. Centre. The names and addresses of those attending camp and living in the East Middlesex Area were obtained and circulated to the Local Authorities concerned. Faeces and urine specimens were obtained from those who attended the camp from the Edmonton T.A. Centre, and eight "carriers" were discovered, all were admitted to hospital, the last on 20th September. Specimens were obtained from the family contacts and apart from the eight "carriers" above referred to, the rest of the Edmonton Cadets submitted "negative" results. Despite exhaustive enquiries both at the camp and in Edmonton, the source of infection was not discovered. The remaining case of Paratyphoid "B" notified during the year was in a man of 59 years. Investigations failed to reveal any connection with the above-mentioned cases. Dysentery. During the year 176 cases of Dysentery were notified—124 Sonne, 28 Giardia, 22 Sal. Typhi-Murium and 2 Sal. Newport. This figure shows a considerable reduction compared with 1951, when 661 cases of dysentery were notified. There was no major outbreak in 1952, the disease occurring throughout the year in a mild form. The control measures, detailed in my Report for 1950, were maintained, and again I wish to record my appreciation of the co¬operation and assistance I received from the General Practitioners, Dr. M. Thomas and Staff of the Public Health Laboratory Service (Edmonton), Education Department and Teachers, and the Staff of the Health Department. 29 Meningococcal Infection. 2 cases were notified during the year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 19 cases were notified during the year (18 in North Middlesex Hospital and 1 at home). Of this total 8 were Edmonton cases. Puerperal Pyrexia. The Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations 1951 which came into operation on 1st August, 1951, replaces Regulations previously in force, and modify the definition of Puerperal Pyrexia. As anticipated, the new Regulations resulted in an increase in notifications of this disease. 111 cases were notified during the year (3 at home and 108 in North Middlesex Hospital). Of this total, 26 were Edmonton cases. During 1951 79 cases were notified. Food Poisoning. 5 cases (non-fatal) were notified during the year, as follows:— Case No. Sex Age Suspected Cause of Illness Organism Responsible 1 F 35 Tinned Herrings Unknown 2 M 51 Duck Eggs Salmonella Typhi-murium 3 F 42 „ „ „ „ „ 4 M 14 „ „ „ „ „ 5 M 9 „ „ „ „ „ Pneumonia. 35 cases were notified during the year. Diarrhoea and Enteritis under 2 years of age. The death rate per 1,000 live births for London was 0.7, whilst that for Edmonton was 0.74 as compared with 0.7 and 0.72 respectively last year. 30 Poliomyelitis. During the year 16 confirmed cases of Poliomyelitis (10 Paralytic, 6 Non-Paralytic) occurred in the Borough. Notifications were received in February (1), March (1), July (1), August (10), September (1), and October (2). In addition to the above cases an Edmonton resident (female aged 32 years) temporarily resident in the North of England, died from this disease in September, 1952. 3 cases were notified in 1951. The following table gives the age, incidence, etc., of those suffering from notifiable diseases, excluding Tuberculosis which is dealt with separately. It must be noted that the figures in the second column "No. removed to hospital" includes those already under treatment at a hospital, for instance, the North Middlesex Hospital. This remark applies more particularly to the infections associated with parturition and includes puerperal pyrexia and ophthalmia neonatorum.
