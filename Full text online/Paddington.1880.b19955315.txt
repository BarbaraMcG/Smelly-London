For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow; viz.:— ward one. All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grovo to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously a long the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 ward two.

Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Borough of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 15 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Saviour's, „ John's, „ Michael and All Angels, „ Mary's, Christ Church, Holy Trinity, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Paul's, „ Peter's, All Saints', „ Stephen's, St. Matthew's, „ Augustine's. „ Luke's, 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road, near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines; Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George, Hanover Square,and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Yestry, such Board meeting at the Yestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Yestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.: —the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company.

By order, FRANK DETHRIDGE, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, June 6th, 1881. REPORT of the WORKS EXECUTED in the PAYING & SEWERS DEPARTMENTS, by GEORGE F. STEVENS, Surveyor. to the VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, 30 th June, 1881. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Annual Report on the several works executed, and the chief business transactions in this Department during the Year ended Lady-day 1881. Highways. Further removals of macadamized Roads, and a substitution by wood blocks on a Portland cement concrete foundation have been carried out in Bishop's Road, Eastbourne Terrace, Connaught Street, Connaught Square on north side, Cambridge Street at west end thereof, and South Wharf Road near St. Mary's Hospital. The total number of superficial yards of concrete and wood pavement laid therein is 19,257, and the nett cost is £8,675 4s. 4d., or 9s. O¼d., per yard, with an additional sum of l½d. per yard for extra supervision. The preparation of 16 the ground to receive the concrete and wood blocks, and the laying thereof, were again executed by the Vestry's Officers and the workmen under my superintendence. The area of wood pavement laid down in this Parish, during the last four years is 37,791 square yards, and in extent is equal to 2 miles 1 furlong and 39 yards, at the rate of 30 feet in width of roadway. The Channel paving, granite crossings, and roadways have been relaid and repaired where necessary. The footway pavements in various parts of the Parish were taken up, relaid, repaired, and in some instances repaved in consequence of the increased wear and tear occasioned bv additional traffic from the new streets in this and the adjoining Parishes northward and westward. With reference to the repair of the macadamized and gravel roadways, the works were facilitated more frequently by the diversion of the vehicular traffic and the use of two steam road rollers. A few additional new streets make the extent of Parish roads 44 miles 3 furlongs and 124 yards. The openings made in roads and footpaths by 17 Gas and Water Companies, still continue inconvenient to the public. The number of trenches reinstated is 2,865, and the cost of such work by the Vestry, and paid for by the Companies is £780 17s. 8d. Buildings, New Streets, Sewers, and Drains. In the course of the year, buildings of various classes have been erected, comprising 1 Board School, 4 large warehouses, 12 stables, and 294 dwelling houses. The notices for these erections, as required by the 76th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, were received from the builders, and the Orders of Vestry respecting the depth to which the foundations of such buildings should be laid have been served upon the applicants. Copies of the Orders, together with the Notices, are kept in this Department at the Vestry Hall for future reference. Plans for the formation of seven new streets, 40 feet wide, have been sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and are named Bravington (2) Coomassie, Ashmore, Portnall, Marban, and Fordingley Roads. In the undermentioned new streets two thousand three hundred and eighty-six feet run of 3ft. 9in. x 2ft. 6in. sewers, one brick thick, have 2 18 been constructed, together with the requisite side entrances and air openings to them by private persons, at their cost viz.:— Portnall Road, Bravington Road (a portion), Coomassie Road, Adpar Street. One hundred and eighty-eight feet run of 3ft. Oin. by 2ft. Oin. half-brick sewer, with stoneware inverts, has been constructed in Lanark Villas, extending from Stranraer Place to the sewer opposite No. 63, together with other works at the cost to the Vestry of £90. In consequence of the dilapidated condition of the side walls and invert of sewer in Great Western Road, extending from No. 17 to the Great Western Railway, it was found necessary, in order to its efficient working, to repair the walls and level up the worn invert. These works have been executed by the Vestry's Contractor at a cost of £219. For the drainage of the new buildings there has been laid down six and nine-inch stoneware pipe drains, in accordance with plans submitted to the Vestry with the building notices, and the outlets into sewers of all the drains have been trapped with modern traps at the expense of the building owners. 19 The defective condition of eighty-two old brick and pipe drains, under the public roads and footways from houses and other buildings, has necessitated their reconstruction from the sewers, at the cost of the persons requiring the work to be done. The foregoing works, together with the construction of side entrances to sewers, air openings over them, gulleys in new streets, and repairs to sewers, gulley drains, and catchpits, fixing traps to outlets of guilley and house drains, have been carried out by the contractor at a cost of £2,058 7s. 3d. This amount includes the sum of £1,003 13s. 3d. received from builders and others for works required by them to be executed. All subjects of complaint received, numbering one hundred and seventy-four, whether arising from stoppages in drains, offensive smells therefrom, or other causes, have been at once attended to. One hundred and twenty-four house drains have been examined from sewers in order to ascertain their condition for parties making application and paying for such examinations. In the case of drains found stopped by an accumulation of deposit or local obstruction which could be removed, the same was effected by the use of drain rods, but 20 where the drains were broken in, or otherwise so defective as to necessitate their reconstruction, new stoneware pipe drains were constructed at the applicant's cost. Such of the large brick sewers, and more especially those with segmental inverts, which have not sufficient fall in their gradients to allow the sewage matter to flow freely away, are cleansed from time to time by the removal of deposits which had accumulated therein, and to still further improve their sanitary condition water was freely used for flushing them. The small brick and pipe sewers are also periodically flushed with water. The accumulation of deposit in the sewers as before stated, amounting to one hundred and seventythree cubic yards, has been removed during the year by the Vestry's workmen. The removals of road detritus from catch-pits number 27,138, representing two thousand two hundred and twenty-eight cubic yards carted away, thereby keeping the pits clear for the rainfall to have free course from the roads to the sewers. Workmen employed by the Vestry attend daily to the condition of the urinals, which are fixed in various streets of the parish. 21 Improvement works to sewers and street gulleys have been carried out, viz.:— The construction of four side entrances to sewers for examining and unstopping drains, cleansing, and other purposes. The construction and reconstruction of sixtynine gulley drains in streets, and repair of thirty-seven others. He-naming Streets and He numbering Houses. The following Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been carried out in accordance with the 87th section of the Act of 1862:— Date of Order. Locality. Subsidiary Names abolisned.

BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, In my last Annual Report I intimated that it was not improbable that an estimate of the population of the Parish formed in 1879, and based upon data supplied by the Census of 1871, might be shown by the Census of 1881 to be incorrect. Such is the case. In Paddington, as in some other parts of the Metropolis, the rate of increase in population during the decennium 18(31-71 has not been maintained during the decennium 1871-81. The population of the Parish during the former period increased 27.7 per cent., whereas during the past decade, 1871-81, the increase has been only 10.6 per cent. It therefore follows that calculations of birth rates and death rates based upon the data supplied by the period 1861-71 are now proved to be erroneous. As a matter of fact, the population of St. John's Sub-district has decreased. In 1871 the enumerated population of St. John's was 38,085; in 1881 the unrevised figures are 37,313, showing a decrease of 772 inhabitants. This accords sooner 26 than I anticipated with what is stated in my first Annual Report—"It is riot unlikely that we may see in St. John's what is taking place in the central districts of the Metropolis, viz., a decrease of population, arising not from the same causes—the incursion of railways, the opening up of new streets, &c. —but from the wealthy displacing the more numerous poor." In St. Mary's Sub-district the population has increased. In 1871 the enumerated population of St. Mary's was 58,728; in 1881 the unrevised figures are 69,785, showing an increase of 11,057. By subtracting the decrease in St. John's from the increase in St. Mary's it will be seen that during the past ten years there has been an addition of 10,285 inhabitants to the population of the whole Parish. The figures of the recent Census show the population of Paddington to be 107,098. The population at the previous Census (1871) was 96,813. Availing myself of these figures, I have estimated the population of the Parish at the middle of the year 1880 to have been 106,258, apportioning 68,888 to St. Mary's Sub-district, and 37,370 to St. John's. I purposely defer making any alteration in the statistics of previous years until the revised figures of the Registrar-General are published. Births and Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending 1st January, 1881, 27 2,841 births, and 1,853 deaths, were registered in Paddin&rton. Excluding from consideration the deaths of 186 non-parishioners, the corrected number of deaths in the Parish is seen to be 1,667, and the natural increase of the population from the excess of births over deaths to be 1,174. Births. Of the 2,841 births, comprising 1,413 male and 1,428 female children, 2,181 were registered in St. Mary's Sub-district, and 660 in St. John's. The proportion of the sexes was 100 males to 101 females: whereas in the Metropolis it was 100 males to 96 females. In St. Mary's the proportion was 100 males to 104 females, and in St. Johns 100 males to 91 females. The births were most numerous during the second, and least so in the fourth, quarter of the year. The ratio of the births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 birth to every 37 inhabitants, or a birth rate of 267 per 1,000 of the population. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to the population was 1 to every 32 persons living, or a birth rate of 31.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. 28 In St. John's the ratio of the births to the population was 1 to every 57 persons living, or a birth rate of 17.7 per 1,000. The preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table:— Sub-Dintrict. Eastimated Population. Birth. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000 St. John's 87,370 060 1 to 57 17 7 St. Mary's 68,888 2,181 1 to 32 31.7 Paddington 106,258 2,841 1 to 37 26.7 The birth rate was for London 36.2 per 1,000. „ ,, England and Wales 34 .6 per 1,000. Deaths. The total deaths registered in Paddington were, as already stated, 1,853. Of these 5 happened in the Lock Hospital and 237 in St. Mary's Hospital. The 5 deaths in the Lock Hospital and 181 of the deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, being those of nonparishioners, are not dealt with in this Report. Of the remaining 1,667 deaths 1,224 occurred in St. Mary's sub-district and 443 in St. John's. The 134 deaths in the Workhouse—63 males and 71 females—are included in the deaths in St. Mary's sub-district. 29 The deaths were most numerous during the first, and least so in the second, quarter of the year. The following table shows the ratio of deaths to the population, and the death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish and in its two sub-districts:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Deaths.

A death-rate of 15.7 per 1,000 for the whole Parish must be considered satisfactory. At the same time it must be borne in mind that in calculating this death-rate no account is taken of the deaths unknown to me of parishioners in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and in other hospitals, institutions, and places beyond the boundaries of the Parish. The deaths in the Parish of persons who were not parishioners, merely temporary sojourners in it, may be considered to some extent as a set-off against such deaths. It will perhaps, too, be conceded that a death-rate of 15.7 per 1,000, though greatly in excess of what it ought to be, is, in these days of imperfect sanitation, one which admits of a margin to meet such omissions. The diminution of mortality in the Parish, notwithstanding the yearly increase of population, is apparent from the subjoined figures, which represent the corrected numbers of deaths registered in Paddinglon from all causes during the four years 1877-80, inclusive:— Year Corrected Number of Deaths. 1877 1,706 1878 1,761 1879 1,939 1880 1,667 31 The low rate of mortality which prevailed in Paddington obtained in the larger area of the Metropolis, where, says the Registrar General, "only on five other occasions in the last forty years has so low a death-rate (22.2) been recorded, namely, in 1850, 1856, 1872, 1876, and 1877, and it will be noted that of these six years of low mortality no less than four occurred in the last decennium." During the year 1880 there were 420 deaths of infants under one year and 671 of children under five years of age. These figures represent 25.1 and 40.3 per cent. respectively of the total corrected deaths (1,667) in the Parish. The rate of infantile mortality was 148 deaths to every 1,000 registered births. In the 20 largest English towns the rate was 169 and in London 158 per 1,000 registered births. In the 19 largest Provincial Towns it ranged from 146 in Bristol to 219 in Leicester. The magnitude of the rate in Paddington, as is shown in Table V., was to a great extent determined by the exceptional fatality from summer diarrhoea, and so, too, in the places above mentioned. Zymotic Diseases. The seven principal zymotic diseases—the diseases most influenced by sanitation—caused 228 deaths; 32 the death-rate being, as is shown in Table IV., 21 per 1,000 of the population, whereas in London it was 3.7. The above figures (228) represent all the deaths from those diseases which actually occurred in the Parish, no cognizance being taken of the cases of infectious disease which were removed to hospitals beyond its limits. Small-pox. From small-pox there were 475 deaths in London, as compared with 450 in 1879. In January, 1880, the disease was inconsiderable in amount; in March the number of cases under treatment in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board had more than doubled; in the beginning of July it had still further increased; during the next three months the disease rapidly declined, and in October the cases only slightly exceeded in point of number those at the commencement of the year. In November, in the East of London, particularly in Bethnal Green, whence it first spread in the years 1870-72, the disease greatly increased, and by the end of the year had acquired the proportions of an epidemic, which extended its baleful influence during the earlier months of the present year. From small-pox throughout the year no death 38 occurred in the Parish. Ten cases—nine from St. Mary's sub-district and one from St. John's—were removed to the hospitals, 8 being sent to Fulham and 2 to Highgate. Measles. Measles, less fatal in London in 1880 than in 1879, was more than usually fatal in some provincial towns. In Paddington it caused 41 deaths; 38 being of children under five years of age. The mortality, generally greatest during the fourth quarter of the year, was most during the first quarter, a circumstance attributable to the low temperature and fog which prevailed for a time during that period. In Paddington the proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths was 24'6, in London it was 18'5. Scarlet Fever. From scarlet fever 40 deaths occurred. To the prevalence of this disease in an epidemic form in the autumn of the year, occasioned by the use of contaminated milk, I have already referred in my quarterly reports. It is, however, worthy of remark, that the total deaths in the Parish from scarlet fever were fewer than in either of the two previous years. Diphtheria. In London the rate of mortality from diphtheria 3 34 exceeded by more than 50 per cent, the average rate in the nineteen provincial towns. In Paddington there were 15 deaths, being at the rate of 9.0 per 1,000 deaths; in London the proportion was 6.7. Whooping Cough. More deaths resulted in London from whooping cough than from any one (except diarrhoea) of the seven principal zymotic diseases. In London the proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths was 42.4; in Paddington it was 29.4. Fever. To fever, the outcome generally of bad drainage, bad water, and filth accumulation, fewer deaths in London were referable last year than in any one of the last forty years—a fact which shows that some ameliorative influences were in operation, or, in other words, that sanitary requirements, and the expendditure in connection therewith, have not been wholly unproductive of good. In Paddington, typhoid fever caused 13 deaths, being at the rate of 7.8 per 1,000 deaths; whereas in London it was 8.5. Diarrhœa. Table V. shows that one half of the mortality attributable to the seven principal zymoses was due 35 to diarrhoea and whooping cough; temperature accounting largely for the increased fatality of the former during the third quarter, and of the latter disease during the first quarter of the year. 55 of the 67 deaths from diarrhoea occurred during the third quarter of the year, 52 being of infants under one year of age, and 62 of children under five years. In Paddington the proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths was 40.2; in London it was 46.4. Water. The average daily quantity of water supplied as usual by eight companies to the inner circle of London was 142,190,921 gallons, being 7¾ millions of gallons more than in the previous year. This was an average daily allowance of 34.1 gallons per head of the population—a quantity much in excess of what is required, and indicating great waste upon the part of the consumers. Of the above enormous quantity 71,879,776 gallons were sometimes grossly polluted by sewage matters, 61,765,034 gallons were occasionally so polluted, but to a less degree, whilst only 8,546,112 gallons were uniformly of excellent quality for dietetic purposes. The temperature of the Thames water supplied by the Chelsea, "West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand 36 Junction, and Lambeth Companies varied from 41° Fahr. in February to 68° Fahr. in August. That of the Lea water delivered by the New River and East London Companies ranged from 42° Fahr. in January and February to 67° Fahr. in August. These objectionable extremes rendered both waters unpleasantly cold in winter and unpalatably warm in summer. Whilst the temperature of the river water ranged through 27° Fahr., the deep well water, supplied by the Colne Valley Company, showed a range of 14°, and that by the Kent Company only 5.4° Fahr. The average proportion of total solid matters contained in 100,000 parts by weight of water was rather less than in the previous year. Much of these solid matters was entirely harmless when the water was used for drinking purposes, but decidedly objectionable when it was used for washing, because the water was thereby rendered hard. A small proportion of the solid matters consisted of organic substances which are always objectionable, and when present in river water may prove dangerous to health. The pollution of the Thames and Lea waters is to a great extent of animal origin. Although the Companies deriving their supplies from these rivers 37 subjected their waters to efficient filtration, yet it was only during the months of May, June, and July that the water sent out by them was even in some measure fit to drink. At no period during the past twelve years has the water abstracted from the Thames been so much polluted by organic matters as during the past year. The water drawn from the Lea was at times of very bad quality, that supplied by the New River Company in the month of February was unfit for drinking, as was that delivered by the East London Company in the months of August, September, and October. The water of both the Thames and the Lea is becoming year by year less suitable for domestic use. The noxious organic matters in water are in suspension, but their state of division is so fine as to render their removal by artificial filtration through sand impossible. On the other hand, the natural filtration through great thicknesses of porous strata which the Kent, Colne Valley, and Tottenham deep well waters have undergone, renders artificial filtration unnecessary. Of the deep well waters that supplied by the Colne Valley Company was the best. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and Middlesex Companies which draw their supplies from the Thames, as do the Chelsea, 38 the Southwark, and Lambeth Companies. Of the river waters, that obtained from the Lea and sent out by the New River Company was the best; and of that taken from the Thames the best average supplies were furnished by the Chelsea and West Middlesex Companies. The worst average water was delivered by the Southwark and Lambeth Companies. For many of the preceding remarks, as well as for the annexed tables showing the condition of the London waters, I am indebted to Dr. Frankland's Annual Report to the Registrar-General. 1 have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health.

Paddington. SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF the INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC LIGHTING upon the subject op the AVERAGE METER SYSTEM. 4 TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON. Public Lighting Department, June 21st, 1881. Gentlemen, I have to submit the Seventh Annual Report ending Lady-day, 1881, as to the working of this department. During the year the following damages have been done to the public lamps, either through accidents or carelessness, viz.:—5 lamp posts knocked down, 12 lamp columns broken, 8 head-irons and lanterns damaged; repairing this work having been executed by the Vestry's own staff. In 13 cases the parties liable for such damage have been discovered, and the expenses attending the restoration have been paid by them. Where necessary summonses have been issued to enforce payment. 52 The severe frosty weather during the past winter occasioned a very large number of the lights to be either bad or out part of the night owing to the supply services freezing, also the formation of naphthaline therein. These obstructions were removed as speedily as possible by the application of hot water and salt, or paraffin, as the case required, such work being performed by the lamplighters. The lamp services throughout the Parish are now maintained by the Gas Company in a most efficient manner. The number of notices sent to them during the year for the rectification of stoppages being 175. The accompanying tables will show the reported number of defects in the Metered and Scale Lamps during the twelve months. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WESTON, Inspector of Public Lighting for the Parish of Paddington. 53 METERED LAMPS. Quarter ending. Knocked down and out of Lighting.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF WORKS DEPARTMENT. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADD1NGT0N. Works Department, 21 st June, L881. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the annual report relative to the works of Dusting, Slopping, Watering, and Carting Materials, Smiths' work and general repairs in connection with this Department for the year ending Lady-day, 1881. Dusting.— This work during the last two years has considerably increased owing to the number of new houses erected on the north-west portion of the parish. During the past year 3,542 horses have been engaged in dusting, giving a daily average of 1242, the total number of loads collected being 17,842, or a daily average of 62.60 loads per working day, or 5.04 loads per horse per day. From this quantity collected in the rough, 15,984½ chaldrons of ashes, 9,613½ chaldrons of breeze, 14 tons of coals, 544 loads of hard core, 1,686½ tons of 58 soft core, 39½ tons of bones, 49 tons of rags, 39 tons 5½ cwt. of old iron, 1 ton 16½ cwt. various metals, 11 tons 11 cwt. of white glass, and 68 tons of black glass have been abstracted. In consequence of the severe frosty weather in January last the canal traffic was entirely blocked for nineteen days, causing great inconvenience and expense in having to deposit the ashes, breeze, and soft core on the wharves. Slopping.—The quantity of road scrapings, slop, water, and snow taken from the roads during the year has been 27,906 loads, the maximum number collected in one week being 2,731, and the minimum 221, giving a daily average of 89.44 loads. From off Uxbridge Road 2,661 loads of slop and snow, &c., have been collected, or a weekly average of 51.17 loads; from Westbourne Grove 534.5 loads, or a weekly average of 10.27 loads. In this Department the blockage of the canal through frost also caused considerable expense and inconvenience. The beforementioned work has been executed by 5,494 horses and carts, giving a daily average of 17.60 horses, or at the rate of 5.08 loads per horse per day. There has been sent away by the canal 22,846¾ 59 tons of slop and sweepings in 565 boats, and 5,059¼ loads have been shot at open shoots. The average cost, collecting, loading boats, haulage, tonnage, and expenses incidental thereto, with the exception of sweeping, has been 5s. 5.19d. per load. It may also be noticed that the heavy fall of snow on the 18th of January last, tended to increase the expenditure in this department, it being found necessary to collect the snow as quickly as possible from various parts of the Parish, otherwise a rapid thaw setting in, low lying districts would be liable to inundations. The following course was adopted on that occasion: after the fall, all available men were engaged in clearing the crossings, intersections, channels and gullies. Attention was also given to the main leading thoroughfares so far as practicable, by continually using the snow plough, and stacking the snow on each side of the roadways, cutting grips where necessary and clearing the channels, so that the water might flow freely to the gullies. The quantity of snow collected (2,230 cubic yards) was deposited on the south side of the Uxbridge Road, and allowed to thaw away; also 4,000 cubic yards at the rear of the Vestry Hall, and 430 cubic yards on the wharves. The accumulation at the rear of the Vestry Hall, 60 and on the wharves was dissolved by the injection of steam, at a cost of about 1s. per load. Had the canal been navigable at this time, and the snow sent away by boats, it would have cost 2s. 6d. per load. It would not be prudent to recommend the collection of snow, only where it becomes absolutely necessary; under such circumstances, if the snow is not frozen, and the area for stowage limited, dis* solving by means of steam (if easily obtainable) is the most convenient and economical method for quickly getting rid of it. Watering.—The dryness of this season compared with the previous year necessitated an increase in the number of days' watering. The water vans being out 135 days. This giving a daily average of 23.82 per day. Carting Materials.—A considerable increase has taken place in this department, owing in a great measure to the wood paving works carried out during the summer, the total number of horses and carts employed being 4,356, or a daily average of 1437. Horses.—The present number of horses is 55, and they are all in excellent health and condition, the losses during the twelve months being two only, viz.:— On April 10th, 1880.—A grey gelding, No. 20, 61 was killed owing to an accident, the off hind leg, being fractured in a longitudinal tion, from six to eight inches in length, extending from the fetlock joint upwards. This horse was purchased four years since. On the 10th October, 1880.—A bay gelding, No. 31, died from an extensive rupture of the liver. At the close of the watering season it was, as usual, deemed prudent to weed out 5 of the defective horses, and these were disposed of by public auction. It may be interesting to state that during the past five years ending Lady-day, 1881, the percentage of loss by deaths has been 11*57, or a yearly average of 2*31 per cent.; by sales 26*31, or a yearly average of 5*26 per cent. The actual money loss by sales, deaths, &c., in the five years has been 23*95 per cent., or a yearly average of 4'75 per cent.

And we state that the several Contracts entered into by the Vestry during the year ending 25th March, 1881, are specified in the foregoing statement of such Contracts marked B. And that the moneys owing to, and the Debts and Liabilities owing and incurred by such Vestry respectively are, to the best of our belief, specified in the foregoing statements of such Credits, Debts, and Liabilities respectively, marked C. And we further wish to state that the manner in which the Accounts are kept has met with our entire approbation. And we beg to thank Mr. Dethridge, the Vestry Clerk, and his Assistants, for the able and courteous assistance they have rendered us during the investigation. We would add that, having in view the statement made by the President of the Local Government Board, in reply to a question asked by Mr. Firth in the House of Commons on 8th February, 1881, we are of opinion that, under the existing state of the law, the examination by us of the Parochial Accounts of the Parish of Paddigton is practically of no effect, as the said Act gives us no power to enforce payment of the surcharges.

The 739 births, comprising 368 male and 371 female children, show an annual birth rate of 26 per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish. Deducting the deaths of 39 non-parishioners in the two hospitals in the parish,— 38 in St. Mary's Hospital, and I in the Lock Hospital,—from the total deaths, 400, the corrected number is seen to be 361,—171 males and 190 females,— giving an annual death rate equal to 12.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. During the corresponding quarter of the previous 2 year there were 718 births, and the corrected number of deaths was 503, with a death rate of 18 per 1,000. The recorded natural increase of population from the excess of births over deaths was 378. The subjoined table shows the number of births and of deaths, and the birth and death rates in the two Sub-districts of the parish. TABLE II. Sub-districts. Estimated Population. Births.

To those who do not clearly apprehend the meaning of the terms birth rates and death rates, the diminution of mortality in the parish, notwithstanding the increase of population, will be apparent from the subjoined figures showing the total deaths registered in Paddington from all causes during the second quarters of the years 1876-80. Second quarter of year. Total deaths. 1876 523 1877 535 1878 481 1879 541 1880 400 This remarkably low death rate corresponds with that recorded throughout the country, both in urban and rural districts. In the principal urban population of England and Wales, the death rate was equal to 20.7, whilst in the rural 3 population it did not exceed 18.2 per 1.000; the urban rate being 1.7 and the rural rate 1.3 below the average rates in the corresponding quarters of the ten years 1870-79. In fact, the death rate throughout England and Wales during the second quarter of this year was the lowest recorded in the second quarter of any year since civil registration was established in 1837. The average rate of mortality in the second or spring quarters of the 41 years 1837-78 was equal to 21.9 per 1,000. In the public institutions of the parish there were 82 deaths, viz., 28 in the Workhouse, 53 in St. Mary's Hospital, and 1 in the Lock Hospital. The deaths in the Workhouse are included in the 254 deaths registered in St. Mary's Subdistrict. Of the 53 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 15 were those of parishioners, and are dealt with in this report. The remaining 38 deaths, and the 1 death in the Lock Hospital were those of non-parishioners, and are excluded from consideration. TABLE III.—Mortality at Different Ages. Sub-districts. Under 1 year.

In London it was 120, in the nineteen largest provincial towns it averaged 141, in Cheltenham it was only 71, in Gateshead and in Exeter it reached 184 per 1,000 births. Of the 361 deaths in the parish during the quarter, 41 per cent. were of children under 5 years of age. Sixty-nine persons died whose ages were 65 years and upwards. 4 TABLE IV.

It must, however, be borne in mind that these figures represent only those deaths which occurred in the parish, no cognizance being taken of the cases of smallpox or of scarlet fever removed to Highgate or to the London Fever Hospital, or to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board. Of the 42 deaths, 26 occurred in St. Mary's Sub-district and 16 in St. John's, giving an annual death rate in the former district of 1.4 per 1,000 of the population, and in the latter of 1.6. In Paddington the deaths were at the annual rate of 1.5 per 1,000, in London 2.9, in Leeds 1.4, and in Swansea 11.5. From measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and typhoid fever the deaths were fewer than in the previous quarter, as also were those from the other causes of death not of the zymotic class mentioned in Table IV. 5 TABLE V., showing the localities in which deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases occurred during the second quarter of the year 1880.

The amount of rain was somewhat in excess of the average all over the country. The first half of the month of May was cold, afterwards S.W. winds prevailed. The weather was generally fine, with occasional bright and warm sunshine. The nights were frequently cold. There was very little rain. The month of June was unsettled: the first half was very cold. With the exception of three or four days, rain fell daily, and towards the end of the month thunderstorms were frequent, with heavy rain and hail. In London the rainfall in the 13 weeks ending 3rd July, 1880, was 5.06. Vestry Hall. Paddington, November, 1880. REPORT ON THE HEALTH OF PADDINGTON, for the QUARTER ENDING OCT. 2, 1880.

The 717 births, comprising 347 male and 370 female children, show an annual birth rate of 24.8 per 1,000 of the estimated population of the parish. Deducting the deaths of 47 non-parishioners in the two hospitals in the parish, from the total deaths 432, the corrected number of deaths is seen to be 385—177 males and 2 208 females,—and the annual death rate to be 13.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. In calculating the death rate no account is taken of the deaths of parishioners in places outside the parish; or, on the other hand, of the deaths of nonparishioners in the parish, with the exception of those who died in its public institutions. The recorded natural increase of population from the excess of births over deaths was 332. The population of the parish in the middle of the year, 1880, is estimated at 115,731. The number of births and of deaths, and the birth and death rates in the two Sub-districts of the parish are shown in the subjoined Table. TABLE II. Sub-districts. Estimated Population. Births. Birth rate per 1,000 of the Population. Deaths. Death rate per 1,000 of the Population.

Total deaths. 1876 478 1877 437 1878 413 1879 372 1880 432 3 It will be observed that the number of deaths during the third quarter considerably exceeded that of the corresponding period of last year, which was an exceptionally healthy quarter. The same fact was observable throughout the country. In the public institutions of the parish there were 92 deaths; viz., 33 in the Workhouse, 57 in St. Mary's Hospital, and 2 in the Lock Hospital. The 33 deaths in the Workhouse—15 males and 18 females—being regarded as those of parishioners, are included in the 393 deaths registered in St. Mary's sub-district. Of the 57 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital 45 were those of non-parishioners, as were the 2 in the Lock Hospital, and are therefore not dealt with in this report. TABLE III.—Mortality at Different Ages.

The rate of infant mortality in Paddington was 199 deaths to 1,000 registered births. In London the proportion was 212; in the aggregate of the nineteen largest provincial toAvns it averaged 2G3; in Swansea it was 109, in Preston, 376 per 1,000; in Westmorland the proportion was only 87; in Leicestershire it reached 271 per 1,000 births. The excessive mortality of infants in Paddington explains the fact of the total deaths during this quarter being more numerous than during the corresponding quarters of the 4 last two years, and it will be seen on referring to Table IV. that much of that mortality was due to diarrhœa. The deaths of children under five years of age constituted 45 per cent. of the total deaths. TABLE IV. Principal causes of death in Paddington during the 13 weeks ending October 2nd, 1880.

In calculating this rate no cognisance is taken of the cases of infectious disease which were removed to hospitals outside the parish. Diarrhœa.—In Paddington, as throughout the country, the mortality from Diarrhœa during the quarter was excessive. Notably a disease of the summer months it is apt to prevail among children, more particularly amongst infants in urban populations'—hence the names, summer diarrhœa and infantile diarrhœa. Of the 55 fatal cases, 45 were of infants 5 under one year of age. There is room for doubt as to the causes of this disease. It is admitted that its prevalence is connected with a high temperature, and that it is often attributable to errors in diet; but there are circumstances which justify the belief that other influences are in operation which at present are unknown. So great has been the fatality of this disease duriDg the past quarter that a general enquiry into the subject is about to be instituted by the Local Government Board. Scarlet Fever.—Although only six deaths were recorded in the parish, that scarlet fever prevailed extensively was evident from the fact that much of the time of the Inspectors was occupied in disinfecting apartments and premises in which the disease had occurred. The following extracts from my fortnightly reports to the Sanitary Committee show the character and extent of the epidemic, together with the measures adopted for its abatement:— "October 7th, 1880.—I beg to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that numerous cases of scarlet fever have occurred in the parish in the course of the past two months. The disease has been of a mild type, and has therefore not affected the death returns. From my fortnightly reports I learn that since July 15th 56 cases of scarlet fever have received the attention of the Inspectors. I have reason to believe that these 56 cases do not include all that have occurred, and that in many instances the medical attendant has superintended the disinfection, and the services of the Inspectors have not been required. The most important point is that in nearly all the cases reported to me the milk is said to have been supplied by one firm of dairymen. The firm in question assures me that there has been no case of scarlet fever amongst any of the men, women, or boys employed by it. I am making a personal examination of every one of the servants and of their homes. I have examined the premises of the dairymen, but have found no clue to the outbreak. I have addressed a circular letter to every medical man in the parish asking particulars of every case of scarlet fever that has come under his notice within the last two months. 6 "October 21st, 1880.—In my last Report I informed the Committee of the outbreak of scarlet fever in Paddington, and expressed the opinion that it was caused by the milk supplied by a firm of wellknown dairymen in this parish. Subsequently I examined all the persons employed by that firm, and many of their families, and inspected also the premises of the dairymen. Having failed to find any trace of scarlet fever, I determined to inspect the farms whence their supply of milk is obtained, and have been, with that view, to Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire. There I spent five days in making my investigations; and in Oxfordshire I found that scarlet fever had for some time extensively prevailed in the village of Tetsworth, where many of the milkers employed at the neighbouring farms reside. Two of those farms supplied the London dairymen referred to with milk. On one of those two farms five milkers were employed; and I found that in the families of three of them some of the children have recently suffered from scarlet fever. At the other farm three milkers were employed, and scarlet fever had appeared in all three families, one case having terminated fatally. I have thus proved to my own satisfaction that the outbreak in Paddington was due to contaminated or infected milk supplied by those farms, and that no blame whatever attaches to the London dairymen, as they were ignorant of the existence of scarlet fever at Tetsworth, as was also the Medical Officer of Health for the district. The milk from the two infected farms was immediately discontinued." Statistics and further observations are reserved until after the termination of the epidemic. 7 Table v., showing the localities in which deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases occurred during the third quarter of the year 1880.

Flooding of Houses in the Parish. In the month of July my attention was called to the flooding of the basements of certain houses in Westbourne Grove, Delamere Crescent. Bristol Gardens, and Emily Street. Similar floodings had occurred in other parishes, viz., in Holloway, Islington, St. Pancras, and Chelsea. In Chelsea, I was told, the water rose to a height of 4 feet in the basements of some of the houses. My attention was particularly directed to Westbourne Grove. Upon enquiry, I learned at one house that the whole of the basement had been inundated with water, mixed with sewage, to a depth of 12 inches; some 2 or 3 inches above the skirting board in the kitchen. I was informed that the same thing had happened in the same premises some eight or ten times during the last ten years; in fact, whenever there had been such exceptional rain-storms as had then occurred. 9 In the adjoining premises the water rose to a height of 6 inches. On one occasion only during the last fifteen years had the same annoyance been experienced. I came to the conclusion thai these floodings were owing to the middle level sewer in the Uxbridge Road, not being of sufficient capacity to carry off the sewage and the storm-water, whenever very heavy rains occur. At such times the sewer in the Queen's Road, which accommodates Westbourne Grove, speedily becomes full, causing the contents of the house-drains discharging into it to be forced backwards, through the traps, into the areas, and thence into the basements of the houses. The sewer in the Queen's Road, was found on inspection, to be in good condition. On my recommendation the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works was called to the insufficiency of the relief afforded by the middle-level sewer to the drainage of the Parish. Meteorology. Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S., reports to the RegistrarGeneral, that the mean reading of the barometer was below the average during July, that it showed an excess during August, and that it corresponded with the average in September. The weather in July was dull, unsettled, and wet in all parts of the country. In some places rain fell on twenty-six or twenty-seven days in the month. The fall of rain exceeded the average at all places, and by as much as 3 or 4 inches in some localities. Thunder-storms were of frequent occurrence. At the beginning of August the weather was cold with frequent rains. After the 8th to the end of the month the weather was genial and fine. During the first week of September the weather was fine; during the next fortnight the fall of rain was very heavy, causing destructive floods in many places. During the last week of the month, the weather was fine and warm. In London the rainfall in the thirteen weeks ending 2nd October, 1880, was 7.99 inches. Vestry Hall, Paddington, December, 1880.
