Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 31st Annual Report on the health of the people of Brentford and Chiswick. The health of the population in general continued to be good with no serious outbreaks of infectious disease, though measles and influenza incidence caused a good deal of loss of school and working time. Neither illness, however, assumed a virulent form. The work on the reduction of slum conditions speeded up during the year and details of the progress of the five-year plan of slum clearance can be seen in the Report. The rate of actual demolition of unfit property has to depend on the availability of housing for the tenants, and so the endeavour is made to do the necessary surveys and representations just so far ahead as will allow for demolition soon after the legal processes have been completed.• The incidence of infectious disease was not high during 1958 and there were no outbreaks of any infection or of food poisoning. Two cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were confirmed as such. The scheme for vaccination against poliomyelitis expanded greatly during the year and by the end of 1958 a great increase in the number of children who had had at least one injection to protect against this disease, had taken place. In addition, progress was being made with the provision of the second injection for children, and various classes of adults were being offered and were receiving vaccination. It will be seen from the Report that by the end of the year approximately half the children under 16 in the borough had received two injections of anti-poliomyelitis vaccine. A rise occurred in both the birth rate and the death rate, principal causes of death being again circulatory disease, heart disease and cancer. Although the notifications of tuberculosis were slightly lower than in 1957 the number of deaths rose being 7 as compared with 4 in the previous year. There were no cases of diphtheria and no deaths from poliomyelitis. Welfare work in general continued to expand and in particular the public interest in the welfare of the aged and chronic sick became more lively. During the year a new welfare organisation was formed which it was hoped in time would be competent to deal with all types of welfare problems arising within the borough. The first work carried out was the provision of a new Meals on Wheels service operated from the Public Health Department, and altogether during 1958, 3,000 more meals for the house-bound elderly were provided than during the previous year. Work on the prevention of atmospheric pollution continued throughout the year, routine observations being taken at the various sites where instruments have been kept, and complaints of smoke nuisance being investigated and abated by voluntary action of the owners of industrial firms. 7 In this year the work began for the survey of the first Smoke-Control Area in the borough, details of which can be found in the body of the Report. From this beginning it is hoped that the smoke-free area will expand in ever growing circles until the atmosphere is free at least from visible atmospheric pollution. There is something quite stimulating about three items in this preamble ac it gives rise to a vision of a borough without slums, with clear bright air and shining unpolluted buildings, and with every facility immediately available for the help of old people who have fallen on evil times. I consider that 1958 has been a good year for this borough. I am grateful to many persons for material included in this Report and a list of their names is given below. I would like to thank also the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee without whose goodwill and enthusiasm progress could not be made, and also the Chief Public Health Inspector, the Chief Clerk and all the Staff of the Public Health Department for their work throughout the year and for all they have done to make this Report comprehensive and accurate.

Rate (1957-1958) £4,739 The Borough is divided into nine Wards: BRENTFORD: Brentford East Brentford West Brentford Central CHISWICK: Chiswick Park Grove Park Bedford Park Gunnersbury Old Chiswick Turnham Green In the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick the eastern half is mainly residential with a certain number of industrial buildings of the smaller type interspersed throughout, while in the western half there is a highly industrialised section chiefly situated along the Great West Road. There are 630 acres of open space within the Borough with ample facilities for refreshment and recreation both for the public in general and for the sporting activities of particular groups. The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25% a very reasonable proportion for an urban area. The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades, artisans, factory workers etc., and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds. The amount of slum property is not considerable and progress is now being made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation. The rehousing of the tenants in council houses, details concerning assessment of slum dwellings, demolition and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report. In the 1956 and 1957 Annual Reports it was possible to state that the number of cases of statutory overcrowding known to the Public Health Department had diminished, but in 1958 this was no longer the case and there was an increase both in the number of people coming to complain of living in overcrowded conditions and in the number actually proved to be statutorily overcrowded under the terms of the Housing Act. 9 The number of new dwellings built by the Council showed a slight drop over the previous year and there were very few built by private enterprise in the Borough during 1958. The houses built by the Council were still required for rehousing of tenants from slum clearance areas, and the need for rehousing of families from requisitioned properties which would be due for release before 1960 meant that still the waiting list of overcrowded families could not be dealt with. The unemployment figures for adult persons, i.e. aged 18 and over, in the Borough at the end of 1958, reflected the national general decrease in the number of jobs available due to a widespread readjustment of industry. On 8th December 1958, there were 283 unemployed altogether of which 223 were men and 58 women. This compares with 140 men and 42 women unemployed at the end of 1957 and 125 men and 59 women unemployed at the end of 1956. On 3rd December 1958, the number of jobs vacant totalled 227 of which 93 were for men and 134 were for women. Although the level of unemployment was higher in 1958 than in previous years, there was still a condition of fairly full employment existing in the Borough up to the end of the year bearing in mind that a considerable proportion of the numbers unemployed were men and women in the course of changing their jobs. Boys Girls Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31.12.58 11 10 21 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 62 60 122 Totals 73 70 143 Vacancies outstanding at 31.12.58 69 128 197 The number of vacancies is a little deceptive since the Christmas leavers had still to be placed in work after 31st December, also a choice of work for boys leaving school was not so great as in recent years.

Capacity 12,049 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1958 48,312 Average number per day 147 Maximum number using baths on one day 533 Chiswick Open Air Swimming Pools:- Large Pool Area 7,500 sq.ft. Capacity 33,750 c. ft. Small Pool Area 3,500 sq.ft. Capacity 18,375 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1958 81,029 Average number per day 547 Maximum number using baths on one day 2,714 The figures for use of the swimming baths are quite a good indication of the type of weather prevailing during the summer months, particularly those for the open-air pool. The summer of 1958 was cold, wet and there was very little sun, and the drop in use of the pools was considerable. An interesting fact, however, emerges- that the drop in the open-air swim ming pools was much less marked than in the indoor pool, 81,029 total in 1958 comparing with 91,981 total in 1957 were in Chiswick, whereas in the Brentford indoor bath the figures were 48,312 in 1958 as compared with 71,445 in 1957. This is the lowest figure for Brentford since 1953, but apparently a considerable amount of the drop was due to the occurrence of a strike of the omnibuses which lasted for some weeks during the early part of the summer and indeed at the time when the weather was at its best. The purification of the water of these pools is by intermittent chlorination and the amount of free chloride aimed at is 0.6 parts per million. Water samples are taken daily throughout the season. Paddling Pools-Duke’s Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60" x 60') 7,200 sq.ft. Depth 6" to 1' in middle These paddling pools are filled daily from the mains supply and ½ pint of Chloros is added at each filling. They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather condition.

The total number using the baths during 1958 was 19,113 persons. Chiswick:- In Belmont Road, Chiswick, the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths, 22 for men, and 9 for women. In addition, 2 hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1958 was 41,349 persons. In these premises are also 30 washing compartments comprising 30 coppers, a rinsing section, 30 drying horses, hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines. Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1958, 1,815 persons took advantage of the service. 12 VITAL STATISTICS, 1958 Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 746 394 352 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population-14.0 Illegitimate 54 23 31 TOTAL 800 417 383 Stillbirths Total Male Female Legitimate 9 4 5 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) Births -13.56 Illegitimate 2 1 1 TOTAL 11 5 6 Deaths Total Male Female 641 320 321 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population-11.22 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis - Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) Births Other Puerperal Causes - - Nil.

The lowest death rate ever recorded in the Borough was 10.16 in 1953. The principal causes of death were:- 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 1953 Circulatory Disease 222 215 224 206 205 173 Heart Disease 99 82 91 96 98 100 Cancer 127 131 150 136 159 119 Death Rate of all infants per 1,000 live births 17.50 Death Rate of all legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 14.75 Deaths from Measles (all ages) Nil Deaths from Whooping Cough (all ages) Nil Deaths from Diarrhoea or Gastro-Enteritis (under 2 years) 1 Deaths from Cancer (all ages) 127 Deaths from Tuberculosis (all ages) 7 To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. In 1958, this factor is 1.0 and so the corrected death rate is the same as the crude death rate i.e. 11.22. The rate for the whole of England and Wales is 11.7, slightly higher than that for this Borough. Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation and in operation since November, 1949. The distribution of cancer deaths in sites and ages is shown below. Cancer of the lung accounted for nearly half the male deaths.

The ages of these cases were:- Males: 26, 30, 34, 43, 85, 86 Females: 37, 78 Three of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough. In all, 11 persons, including residents of other places, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick, 2 motor-cyclists, 3 motor vehicle 15 passengers, 1 motor assisted pedal cyclist, 5 pedestrians. No child died on the roads of the Borough during 1958. Birth Rate The Birth Rate rose from 13.8 in 1957 to 14.0 in 1958. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then gives a comparative birth rate of 13.16 compared with 16. 4 for England and Wales as a whole. INFANT MORTALITY During 1958 the number of live births recorded was 800, 746 legitimate and 54 illegitimate. There were 11 still births, 5 male and 6 female. There were 14 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, (as compared with 13 in 1957, 15 in 1956, 10 in 1955 and 21 in 1954), giving an infant mortality rate of 17.5 for 1958. The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 22.5 for England and Wales. The graph on page 18 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century. The number of premature infants born in 1958 was 59, including premature stillbirths. Of the 53 premature infants born alive, 2 were born at home, (one of these survived to the end of one month, the other died after being transferred to hospital), 51 were born in hospital, of whom 47 survived to the end of one month. There is some improvement in the survival rate of premature infants shewn here. The percentage of premature infants to total births (live and still) is 7.3. There seems to have been this year some reversal of the rather alarming upward trend in the figures for premature confinement though the comparative rate is still more than double that for 1950. The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1950. 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 3.3 4.5 5.6 4.9 6.0 6.9 6.4 8.4 7.3 Causes of infants deaths are shown in Table II on page 65. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes:- Puerperal Sepsis Nil Other Causes Nil There was one maternal death in Brentford and Chiswick, the first for six years. It occurred in the first weeks of pregnancy, in hospital, and was due to a cause not preventible by any methods known to medicine. During the year, 58 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified as compared with 82 in 1957. Four cases occurred after home confinement, 54 were notified from Chiswick Maternity Hospital. 12 of the cases were residents of the Borough. No deaths occurred from this cause. 16 The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after child-birth or miscarriage." 17 GRAPH "A" GRAPH SHOWING INFANTILE MORTALITY RATES DURING THE PERIOD 1900-1958 18 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained, and are as follows:- Number of children examined:- Primary Schools 11,201 Secondary Modern Schools 5,271 16,472 Number of children requiring treatment 120 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 73 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 38 These figures all show an improvement over 1957. By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin, can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station. During 1958, ten persons were referred for cleansing, seven for scabies, two for lice and one for bug infestation. All of these cases were cleared quickly. INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1958 there was a considerable decrease in the incidence of infectious disease. This was due mainly to the fall in measles notifications. Measles is a disease showing a marked biennial fluctuation and the current year was the year of lower incidence. The up and down nature of this disease can be observed from the following table of notifications of this disease during the past ten years. 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 511 269 863 413 810 47 659 107 773 330 Poliomyelitis Two notifications of poliomyelitis were received during the year, and both cases were confirmed as paralytic poliomyelitis. 19 Poliomyelitis Statistics since 1949 Confirmed cases Died Still making progress Condition stationary Fully recovered 1949 4 - - 1 3 1950 9 - - 3 * 6 1951 - - - - - 1952 9 2 - 2 * 5 1953 6 1 - - 5 1954 3 - - 1 2 1955 5 - - 3 * 2 1956 2 - - - 2 1957 2 - - 1 1 1958 2 - 1 - 1 * 1 now left district It can be seen from these figures that of 42 confirmed cases of paralytic poliomyelitis occurring during the past 10 years, 27 have made a complete recovery with full power and normal Movement of all muscles. The scheme for inoculation of children against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956, was expanded considerably during 1958. Other groups were also brought in, and vaccination offered to expectant mothers and later to adolescents. Details of the year’s work are as follows:- No. of persons who received two injections during the year Persons born 1933-42 ChiIdren b o rn 1943-58 Expectant Mothesrs G.P's and families Ambulance personnel Hospital staff 57 4,718 191 13 4 - Towards the end of 1958, a start was made to give persons three injections and details are given below of 1958 injections. They have already been recorded as having two injections. Persons born 19 33-42 Chi1dren born 1943-58 Expectant Mothers G.P'a and fami1ies Ambulance personnel Hospital staff - 1,984 13 - - - By the end of the year 6,225 children under 16 had obtained two injections, roughly 50% of the total for these ages. 20 Puerperal Pyrexia The number of notifications of puerperal pyrexia fell from 82 in 1957 to 58 in 1958. There was no severe infection, these puerperal pyrexia cases were mild and mostly notified under the statutory requirement to notify any temperature rise to over 100° after confinement in the immediate post-natal period. Some of the improvement in these figures, however, is without doubt due to the fact that Chiswick Maternity Hospital was able to accept fewer maternity cases because of the need for provision of nursing staff accommodation on the hospital premises, this provision meant that the number of patient beds was reduced by 13. Smallpox During the year no cases of smallpox occurred in the Borough, nor were there any contacts of confirmed cases. Notification of smallpox contacts is always received from Port or Airport authorities as soon as, or before they enter the district. One case of chicken pox in the Borough was under suspicion in June, and samples were taken for bacteriological investigation - these, however, proved that the case was not smallpox. Vaccination against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in the Borough during 1958 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer. Number of persons who during the year were:- Age groups Total Under 1 l 2-4 5-14 15 & over vaccinated for first time 458 21 12 13 27 531 re-vaccinated - - 6 11 99 1\6 Total 458 21 18 24 126 647 Total number of first vaccinationss:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 298 373 548 487 438 418 430 531 There was a rise in the total number of first vaccinations during 1958, and the really important figure, i.e. first vaccinations of infants under one year old, also showed a considerable rise, the first since 1953. Taking the figure of the number of infants born during 1958 as a basis, the percentage vaccinated in the first year of life was 57.3%. This compares with 42.3% in 1957, 43.7% in 1956, 47.5% in 1955, 50% in 1954 and 55% in 1953. Scarlet Fever There was a considerable rise in the number of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such, the figures being 44 in 1958 as compared with 24 in 1957. 19 of these cases were admitted to hospital. 21 In three instances a second case occurred in the household in which a previous case had been notified, and in one family three cases occurred. In November, two schools were visited because of a rise in the numbers of notified cases of scarlet fever. Almost all the classes in each school were involved either directly or through sibling contacts, and throat and nose swabs were taken from 30 children in one school and 69 in the other. In the former case no bacterial positives were found, in the second, 10 were slightly infected with haemolytic streptococci and had treatment, but the occurrence of new cases stopped after the survey in both instances. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria occurred during the year. The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948. Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough during 1958 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer, and is as follows:- Number of children who Age Total Under 1 l 2-4 5-14 completed a full course of primary immunisation 349 135 32 3 519 received reinforcing injections - - 7 24 31 Number of children at 31.12.58 who had completed a course of diphtheria immunisation at any time before that date (i.e. at any time since 1.1.44). Age at 31.12,58 i.e. born in year Under 1 1-4 5-9 10-14 Total under 15 1958 1957-54 1953-49 1948-44 Last complete course of injections (whether primary or booster) A. 1954 - 58 136 1,756 2,349 1,903 6,144 B. 19 53 or earlier - - 621 1,515 2, 136 It is satisfactory to note that in 1958 there was a rise, in the number of children receiving immunisation against diphtheria, and particularly that a higher proportion of infants under 2 years were immunised. The general immunisation state of the infant and school child community does not yet, however, show an increase and is again below the margin for safety which has been considered to be not less than 75% immune - the present figure is roughly 72%. Whooping Cough 7 cases of whooping cough occurred in 1958. No deaths occurred from this disease. 22 Food Poisoning Only three notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. The organism identified in one of these cases was Salmonella St. Paul, but no bacterial origin was ascertained in the other cases. One other case, notified as dysentery, was later confirmed as food poisoning - organism Salmonella Typhimurium. In April and May respectively, reports were received from two schools in the Borough of an unusual number of absentees through stomach disorders. In one school a full bacteriological survey was made of all the food handlers as school meals had been suggested as a source of this illness, but the results obtained did not suggest that this had been the case. In the other school the proportion of sick children and staff taking school meals was only about 50% of the total sick, and full investigations of food handlers did not appear to be called for. Gastro-enteritis During late March, an outbreak of gastro-enteritis amongst the babies in the Mother and Baby Home in Barrowgate Road required special investigation and a temporary stoppage on admissions to the Home. Continuous observations and bacteriological investigations were made and the Home was pronounced clear of infection on 16th May, 1958. Dysentery Sixteen persons were notified as suffering from dysentery, one case was subsequently diagnosed as food poisoning - Salmonella Typhi-murium. Specimens of faeces were obtained from all contacts of these cases. Although in four instances more than one member of the family was infected, there was no spread and this says much for the hygiene of the families concerned since Sonne Dysentery unfortunately is extremely easy to pass on to other people. Influenza Towards the end of 1957 observations were being kept on the sickness statistics from the Ministry of Labour, the schools attendances and the reports of General Practitioners because of an outbreak of influenza which appeared to be drifting towards this country from the East. This virulent type of influenza had not been traced in any case in the Borough at the end of that year, but for the first three months of 1958 the danger was still to be reckoned with, and the number of beds available in hospital during the first two months became very limited. Admissions of cases of influenza and bronchitis were high, but the real virulent "A" type of virus did not develop in any case and the situation cleared up by March of 1958. Towards the end of the year it was felt that the poor resistance of the public to colds and mild infections, because of the lack of sunshine during the summer, might cause influenza to spread rapidly if it appeared and special watch was again maintained for the illness. Health education was directed towards the avoidance of influenza. Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1958 was 76 as compared with 78 in the previous year, the pulmonary cases amounting to 67 and the non-pulmonary to 9. The number of deaths from this disease was seven. Deaths from tuberculosis were four in 1957, six in 1956, seven in 1955 and four in 1954. 23 The figure of 76 notifications includes 26 inward transfers i.e. cases notified because they had removed into the borough but who had previously contracted the disease elsewhere. This leaves a total of 50 new cases of tuberculosis occurring within the borough, and this figure is only one more than in 1957. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care are provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting is carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic. They are also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B.C.G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis. B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i.e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases; 63 residing in this Borough were inoculated during 1958. A prominent part in the treatment is played by domiciliary chemo-therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician, with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council. Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in chest Hospitals, there is also a Middlesex County Council Hostel for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients. Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training are provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis is dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial During 1958 the Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial continued. In the Autumn of 1950 the Medical Research Council, in conjunction with many local authorities in North London, the Midlands and the North of England began a national investigation into the value of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1950 B.C.G. vaccine was known to be of mass value to those in contact with the disease for example nurses, and children living in the same home as a case of tuberculosis. However, there was disagreement as to whether the vaccine should be used on a wide scale for children who were not contacts. A clinical trial was therefore begun to assess the contribution likely to be made to the prevention of tuberculosis by widespread vaccination. Children who at that time were aged fourteen and were in their last terms at Secondary Modern Schools were invited to take part in the trial. Between September 1950 and December 1952 approximately 60,000 of these children entered the scheme. All were X-rayed on entry and after preliminary skin-tests a proportion of the children were vaccinated with one of two tuberculosis vaccines. Since then these young people have been followed up to find out if the vaccines have in fact prevented tuberculosis. A regular postal enquiry form has been sent to each participant and a regular visit to the home has been made by one of the nurses on the staff of the Local Health Authority concerned. The visits by the nurses have been especially valuable since it has been possible to remind the volunteers and their parents of details about the scheme as well as to get essential medical information. 24 These home visits, which have been carried out in addition to the normal duties of the nurses, have been very successful; much credit is due to nurses concerned for the able and conscientious way in which this work has been done. A further feature of the follow-up has been the provision made for the regular X-raying of the participants. A mass radiography unit from the Medical Research Council has visited the areas at regular intervals and participants have been invited to attend for X-ray in the evening. By 1956 the findings showed that B.C.G. vaccine confers a substantial measure of protection against tuberculosis and the first report of the investigation was published in 1956. As a result Local Health Authorities in England and Wales have been encouraged to offer vaccination to thirteen year old children and it is probable that this measure will effect a considerable reduction in the frequency of tuberculosis in young people in future. During 1958 one visit was paid to Brentford clinic by the mass radiography unit. 125 young people from Brentford and Chiswick were invited to attend and of these 73 attended and had an X-ray. Although the investigation has shown the vaccine to be effective it is desirable to know whether protection only persists for a few years after vaccination or whether such induced resistance lasts for a considerable period. The investigation is therefore being continued for the present. Investigation of New Tuberculosis in the Adolescent On this subject there is nothing to add to the 1957 report. During 1958 no further reviews of volunteers under this scheme, started in 1953 for the investigation of the high incidence of tuberculosis among young adults, were carried out. B.C.G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the tuberculosis vaccinations clinical trial that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B.C.G. a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if necessary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13. During 1958, 421 children were invited to take part in the scheme, 271 consents were received. These children were tuberculin tested, and those found to be positive, indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a minor or major degree at some period in their lives, were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation. 54 positives were so referred. B.C.G. vaccination was carried out on 188 children. In addition 11 contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic. HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1958 The housing conditions of 59 of the 76 cases of tuberculosis were found to be as follows:- 55 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, 24 in flats, 16 in houses, 15 in lodgings or furnished rooms. Three patients came from damp or unfit houses and in 1 case there was statutory overcrowding. This overcrowding was abated during the year by the removal of the family out of the district. The housing particulars of 17 cases were not obtainable either because of removal of patients to other districts or because of resistance of patients to home visiting. 25 Six new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis. 26 cases were inward transfers from other districts and, therefore, had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick. The position regarding cases living in unsatisfactory or overcrowded conditions, outstanding from previous years, is as follows:- Year Cases No, where Conditions improved 1955 2 1 1954 1 - 1953 5 3 Mass X-ray The Mass X-ray unit made a short visit to the Borough to Messrs. Pullins factory which had not entered in the Borough Survey in 1957. 432 were X-rayed there. One case of active tuberculosis was found-a male not resident in this Borough. 26 CRAPH "B" GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1938-1958 27 FOOD CONTROL There was no new major legislation on food and drugs control during 1958, and the main part of the work in this section was devoted to consolidation of the improvements obtainable as a result of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, which came into force in 1956. It is, of course, desirable that every food establishment should be visited at least once during the year, but this was not possible during the year under review because of the heavy work involved in housing surveys required in connection with Clearance Areas etc., and also due to the prolonged and fatal illness of one of the Public Health Inspectors. However, in visits connected with unsound food or complaints of food quality, the opportunity is taken to suggest improvements in hygiene, both equipment or method, and these visits act as supplements to the routine visits. The general public is encouraged to bring to the notice of the Department complaints with regard to unsatisfactory conditions in food shops and catering establishments, and the fact that during the year the number of these complaints was small is taken to indicate that standards are slowly improving. There is evidence in many shops of an increased interest in food hygiene as displayed by the greater use of wrappings for foodstuffs and the provision of screens and barriers to prevent contamination either by insects, food handlers or the customers themselves, who are very often now the worst offenders with regard to food hygiene. Many customers still wish to handle their prospective purchases to feel for quality, and in the course of choosing certain articles may be picked up and rejected several times before sale. This of course constitutes a health hazard and is a most unhygienic practice, so that a barrier between the food and the customer is needed. Under the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, it was required that mobile traders should have available suitable facilities for hand washing. By this year this requirement had been fully satisfied in respect of the mobile icecream vendors, and work to bring other mobile traders vehicles up to standard was continuing.

CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS Ninety-five visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 38 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was required. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year 18 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department. Eight cases were substantiated, the details of which are as follows:- Complaint Action taken Mouldy pork pies Court action - £30 fine and £10.18s.0d. costs (including £7.15s.0d. analyst's fee) Mouldy sausage rolls Court action-£25 fine and £5.13s.0d. costs Glass in milk bottle Warning letter Mouldy sponge pudding Warning letter Dirty milk bottle Warning letter Glass in cheese Warning letter Dirty milk bottle Warning letter Condition of packet of macaroni cheese No action FOOD SAMPLING Food & Drugs Act, 1955. By the courtesy of the Chief Officer, Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available:- Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk, various 75 1 Arrowroot 4 - Butter 5 - Cakes, etc. 6 3 Cheese 7 9 Cream 5 - Drugs 15 - Fish and Pish Products 4 - Fruit-Presh and Canned 12 2 Fruit Squash, etc. 4 - Garden Peas 3 - Ice-Cream 11 - Margarine 5 - Meat and Meat Products 11 - Non-Brewed Condiment 6 1 Sausages 9 2 Spirits 6 - Vinegar 18 - Miscellaneous 17 — Totals 223 18 30 The total number of samples taken was slightly greater than during the previous year and the number of unsatisfactory samples was increased from 4 in 1957 to 18 in 1958. The following are the details from the Chief Officer's report on the 18 unsatisfactory samples and the action taken:- Milk The one sample of milk which was found to be unsatisfactory was from a ⅓ pint bottle sold to a school in the Borough. The milk contained splinters of glass and the evidence showed that this was in the bottle before it was capped at the processing depot. The processors were prosecuted and were fined £10. 0s. Od. together with £3. 3s. Od. costs. Cakes, etc. A complaint was received from a private purchaser that two apple fruit pies purchased from a retailer had an unusual taste suggesting some contamination. Two similar fruit pies were purchased from the same shop by an officer of the Public Control Department. In respect of all these pies the public analyst certified that they were tainted with a hydrocarbon solvent resembling naphtha. Enquiries revealed that the trader had treated the floor of his shop on the previous evening with a proprietary floor dressing and it appeared likely that the pies had become contaminated with the vapour given off by this floor dressing. A sample of this dressing was also sent to the public analyst who expressed his opinion that it was undoubtedly the cause of the trouble. An official caution was sent to this trader in respect of his sales of these pies. Cheese Nine samples of cheese, all the product of the same manufacturers were purchased from various shops in the Borough. The cheese was pre-packed in cardboard cartons each of which contained an assortment of six different varieties. Offences were disclosed in respect of the labelling of these packets; some of the varieties were not correctly described and with some of the packets the prescribed labelling was not marked clearly and conspicuously. A letter of caution was sent to the manufacturers who immediately re-labelled all the stock of this particular food which they held. Fresh Fruit Two samples of fresh fruit, grown in the Lebanon, were purchased from a retailer and arsenic and lead was found on the skins of the fruit in each case very slightly in excess of the maximum recommended as being unobjectionable. The trader was cautioned and advised that adequate washing of such apples would substantially reduce if it did not entirely remove, the contamination which was probably the outcome of spraying by the growers. 31 Non-Brewed Condiment A sample of non-brewed condiment was found to be slightly deficient in acetic acid content. A subsequent sample from the same source was found to be satisfactory and no further action was taken. Sausages Two samples of pork sausages were found to contain sulphur dioxide as an added preservative, although its presence was not disclosed. In each case the amount of preservative found was less than the maximum permitted namely 450 parts per million. An official caution was sent to the trader concerned. Merchandise Marks Act, 1887-1953 The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926, and which relates to the marking with an indication of origin of certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold, are complied with. Inspections were made at 198 separate premises of 583 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruit and butter. A firm of butchers was prosecuted for five offences of exposing for sale imported meat not marked with an indication of origin. The defendant company summoned their shop manager as being the person who committed the offences in question. The employers were convicted but exempted from penalty and the shop manager was fined a total of £10. 0s. Od. Labelling of Food Order, 1953 This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and with the names of the ingredients of a compounded food. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 725 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 122 premises to ascertain whether the above requirements were complied with, no serious infringements of this Order were detected. False or Misleading Descriptions As in previous years food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false or misleading statements and descriptions. Much of this scrutiny of food labels can be combined with inspection work under the Labelling of Pood Order. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action was secured in relation to descriptions applied to "milk block", "Double Tea", an imitation cream powder, cakes filled with a mixture of butter and sugar, canned mixed vegetables, raspberry syrup, powdered soup mixes, medium red salmon, gorgonzola cheese spread and cheese spread. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick. 32 FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR, 1958 Fruit and Vegetables 7 tons Meat and Bacon 12½ cwts Perishable Goods 1½ cwts Tinned Goods 6,324 tins Unsound food is disposed of by incineration, tipping or for animal feeding. MILK During 1958, the following licences were issued under the Regulations mentioned:- Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. Dealer’s Licences 64 Supplementary Licences 17 Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949/54. Dealer s Licences 23 Supplementary Licences 9 BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 7 BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers. It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council. The Corporation employs a staff of 17 at the market and there are 450 holdings with 150 tenants. On busy days roughly 1,500 vehicles pass through the market. Modern sanitary conveniences are provided on the West side of the market and free washing facilities are available at this and other conveniences situated in the market. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employ the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation. Situated in the market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries, tinned foods, etc., and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption. 33 HEALTH EDUCATION During the year, work on the education of the general public in matters of health and hygiene continued by means of personal communication between Public Health Department Staff and individuals, talks to Associations illustrated by topical film strips, poster publicity and leaflet distribution. The main subjects on which publicity was concentrated during the year, were the common cold, measles, food hygiene, home safety and the danger to health of the careless distribution of broken glass. Health education is in some ways the most important work of the department and each member of the department staff is continually educating individual members of the public with regard to the prevention of ill-health, and how to lead full and healthy lives. By health education through conversation, discussions in groups, attendance at lectures, observation, however casual, of health publicity on hoardings, in newspapers, on the cinema, on the wireless, on television, the people are gradually coming to accept certain fundamental rules of healthy living. Unfortunately the best propaganda for good hygiene habits seems still to be fear - warnings of what may happen never have the dramatic results which can be produced by one death from apreventible cause, or the occurrence of an outbreak of one of the more crippling infections, and the very fact that in Brentford and Chiswick for some years the health record has been good, tends to make the general public rather apathetic to appeals for good hygiene standards to be maintained by everyone. Still public opinion, formed because of good health education in the past, can be seen to have developed in many health matters, for instance, the man who spits in public is seldom seen, the grossly dirty and unkempt person is rare and usually avoided by others, the foulsmelling or maggot infested rubbish heaps are quickly reported to the Health Department, and so progress is made. 34 WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1958, 32 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. No patient was found to be in such conditions as to require statutory action under the National Assistance Act. Details of the 32 cases are as follows:- Removed to Hospital 7 Removed to Old People’s Homes 4 Remained at Home (a) meals on wheels provided 2 (b) special laundry service provided 1 (c) with Home Help 2 (d) awaiting admission to Hospital 1 (e) rehoused in Old Person’s Dwelling 1 (f) housing repairs carried out and/or cleanliness improved 5 (g) no help required 5 (h) all help refused 2 Died at Home 2 During the year a total of 306 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service, and the Home Nurses dealt with 586 old people out of a total of 959 cases. These figures compare with 287 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1957 and 577 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 978 cases. Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 36 old people from the Borough were admitted to Old People's Homes through the County Welfare Department, including one person previously brought to our notice in 1957. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them, and it can do this by providing its own Homes or by arrangements with registered Voluntary Organisations. The County Council's Welfare Department administers the County Homes, and one such Home is situated in the Borough. 35 Chiropody A service was maintained throughout the year by the Middlesex County Council whereby old people could have their foot defects treated at reduced cost or free of charge. Figures of the numbers taking advantage of this Service can be found on page 63. Old Folks Friendship Club This is a specially built club house opened in April, 1955, for the use as a social and recreational centre of old age pensioners living in Brentford and Chiswick. The club is open Monday to Friday from 2 - 5 p.m. and there is an organiser in attendance. The old people are enrolled as members at their first attendance, membership costs only one penny per week, and there are 250 names on the register. The members can visit every day, if they wish, for rest room or reading room facilities, or just to meet their friends and talk, but many social occasions are provided for them in the way of concerts, whist drives, etc. A television set is installed in the lounge, and a radiogram in the concert hall. Light refreshments are available. This club also arranges summer outings of which there were three in 1958, on which about 80 - 100 travelled each time, and an annual Christmas party to which all the members are invited - the majority attend. The members have formed their own Concert Party which not only performs to the other members but goes to outside places and gives free performances. Through this club the members are also able to obtain information about the special services at reduced rates which are available within the Borough for them, such as laundry, shoe repairs and hairdressing, and they can be given advice on any difficulties that occur in their private lives. This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are 5 other clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members, for social and recreational purposes. Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at the reduced rates (2d. per bath) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments, 2,357 baths were taken in Chiswick and 722 in Brentford. There is a small increase in the use of these facilities in 1958, showing both that the need for them is present in the Borough, and that they are appreciated. Meals on Wheels The provision of a hot dinner once a day for an old person living alone may make all the difference between health and malnutrition. It was with some concern therefore that it had to be reported last year that the Invalid Meals for London Association was not likely to be able to continue supplying meals for old people unless they were recent hospital discharges or persons still under medical treatment. During 1958, after a meeting of representatives of local organisations convened by the Mayor, a new Welfare Organisation was formed and the first task undertaken by this organisation was to arrange for an alternative supply of meals for the aged housebound. A suitable van and containers to keep food hot were bought, a driver for the vehicle and a helper to distribute the meals were engaged on a salaried basis, and the new service came into operation on 29th September, 1958. 36 For the time being the majority of persons already supplied directly from the Invalid Meals for London were kept on by that Association. The meals for delivery by the new van were obtained from the Acton kitchen of that Association and it was thus possible to eliminate the waiting list, which had been growing throughout the year, because of the double service available. All old persons supplied are recommended on medical grounds, although they are not necessarily suffering from any immediate and urgent illness, and the arrangement at the time of the commencement of the new service was that old people with medical certificates of treatable illness were still to be supplied direct from the Invalid Meals For London Association, other housebound elderly to come on the new service. During 1958, 11,409 meals were provided for 58 old people by the Invalid Meals for London direct service and 1,727 for 34 old people by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation vehicle. At the end of the year the new service was not yet extended to its fullest capacity and there was no waiting list. The total number of meals on wheels delivered in the year was nearly 3,000 more than in 1957. Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged, started in the autumn of 1956, was carried on throughout the year. Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources, then arrangements were made for the Department’s van to call each week to collect the soiled linen, deliver it to Spring Grove Laundry, and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person. No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee. During the year six old persons had been recommended for, and obtained, this service. Home Safety The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone, continued to arrange for inspections during the year. The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer was to include free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. GENERAL The District Superintendent of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Divisional Director of the British Red Cross Society have kindly supplied information concerning their welfare work in the Borough. St. John Ambulance Brigade There are 4 Divisions of St. John Ambulance Brigade in this Borough. No. 54 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Division No.135 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Division No. 95 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Cadet Division No. 86 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Cadet Division 37 During 1958, the two adult Divisions did 1,808 hours Public and Transport duties and treated, during the course of Public duties 169 cases, and whilst off Public duty some 1,112 cases. The No. 54 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Division own an ambulance which removed, during 1958, 101 invalids and covered 3,075 miles. This Division covers duties at the Brentford Football Ground, Chiswick Empire, at various Sports Meetings on the Riverside lands, at the Annual Charity Sports held by the Chiswick Savage Club, and also the Charity Cricket Match organised annually by the Turnham Green Cricket Club. They supply an Instructor for First Aid and organise St. John Ambulance Association classes for the local Civil Defence Corps and they also instruct in First Aid certain of the local Scout troops. They send attendants to Old People's gatherings and outings. Transport by motor ambulance is provided for several local polio victims to their monthly social gatherings. So far as No. 135 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Division is concerned, 110 duties at local Sports Meetings, Public gatherings and Entertainments were carried out, one nurse being available at all times for duty on the local ambulance. Their Divisional Surgeon has given several courses of lectures in First Aid to the Brentford & Chiswick Civil Defence and various branches of Civil Defence in the surrounding district. They also have a Nursing Officer who has given lectures in Home Nursing to Civil Defence. All members of the Division are also members of the National Hospital Service Reserve and available for duty in the local Hospital when required by the Matron. One member is available at all times to assist in the Old People’s Home in Chiswick and is often called on by the Matron of the Home at a minute’s notice. Both First Aid and Home Nursing lectures have been given during the course of the year for the benefit of local factories, Fire Brigade and Ambulance Services. With regard to the two Cadet Divisions, they attend Sports Meetings as messengers and have given a course in Home Nursing for the 1st Brentford Girls' Life Brigade.

WELFARE OF THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED The County Council is responsible, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, for the provision of welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted. There are resident in the Borough 104 blind and 28 partially-sighted persons. 16 of these are in full-time employment; 2 in Workshops for the Blind and 3 as Home Workers, receiving augmentation and supplementation of earnings from the County Council. The remainder are not available for, or are not capable of, training or employment, owing to age or infirmity or for some other reason. There are also 6 partially-sighted and 6 blind children under the age of 16 years, 10 of whom are at Special Schools. In addition, two partially-sighted persons between the ages of 16 and 20 are receiving further education and one blind person is in training. The County Council provides a Home Teaching service for the visitation of blind and partially-sighted people in their own homes, the object of which is to enable partially-sighted and blind people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows. The duties of the Home Teachers include advising blind and partially-sighted persons on all problems relating to their welfare and of all the available social services, to assist them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities, to give instruction in the Braille and Moon systems of raised type, in handcrafts, and, where appropriate, in the deaf-blind manual alphabet A handcraft class is held fortnightly at the Area Welfare Sub-Office, 14a Sutton Court Road,Chiswick. A County Council Old Time Dancing Class for the Blind is held weekly in Ealing and a number of blind residents in the Borough attend. The County Council works in close co-operation with Voluntary Organisations, including the Social Club for the Blind which meets fortnightly at the Christ Church Hall, Turnham Green, and the Middlesex Association for the Blind, who maintain a Holiday Home at Littlehampton, two Residential Homes for the Blind, and assist individual necessitous blind persons. The British Wireless for the Blind Fund supplies wireless sets to registered blind persons through the County Council which maintains all sets for blind and partially-sighted persons. Other services provided directly by the County Council or through a Registered agency, include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handcraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handcrafts, and assisted holidays for those in need. 39 WELFARE OF HANDICAPPED PERSONS OTHER THAN BLIND Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially sighted are operated by the County Council’s Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948; these cover the deaf and dumb and hard of hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by crippling diseases or congenital deformity. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate voluntary organisations, to whom the County Council makes grants in aid. The County Council’s Welfare Department has provided two Welfare Visitors for persons in the Borough who are suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps other than those already mentioned, and they work under the direction of the Area Welfare Officer. They visit such persons in their own homes, with a view to assisting them to obtain from statutory or voluntary sources (or both) facilities, appliances, etc., which may benefit them. The help afforded, may, for example, enable the disabled person to take part in social actitivies, choral classes, dancing classes, attend handcraft classes, obtain a needed holiday, or by provision of ramps for mechanical chairs, handrails, lifting hoists and the like, give a previously non-existent measure of mobility to a person who was chair-bound or house-bound. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems is given, and membership of a voluntary organisation catering for a particular handicap-is facilitated. A Home Work Organiser has also been appointed and suitable handicapped persons who cannot travel to work are provided with part-time employment at home. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, Mr. J.F. Cronk, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road, Brentford. 40 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION During 1958, there were two stations for the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere by the volumetric method. The sites were respectively Brentford Baths and a room on the second floor of a building adjacent to the Town Hall. In addition, two deposit gauges, one at the Metropolitan Water Board Works, Kew Bridge, and the other in Chiswick House Grounds, were used for the measurement of grit deposits from the atmosphere. Each month reports of recordings and other relevant particulars were submitted to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, for comparison with the rest of the country, and assistance was available from the officers of the Fuel Research Station if special problems had arisen concerning readings of results or the breakdown of equipment. Bulletins from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research were received regularly and studied in the Public Health Department so that results could be compared with those in other areas. A brief summary of the year1' s recordings is to be found in tables XII and XIII at the end of the book, and in graphs "C" and "E" which have been prepared from these figures. Graph "D" shows the monthly rise and fall in the pollution figures for Brentford and Chiswick, also Leeds, Central London, and Lerwick. These latter places have been chosen in order to illustrate the varying amounts of pollution from a virtually smokeless atmosphere, i.e. Lerwick, to an industrial area, i.e. Leeds. During the year, 103 visits or observations were made in connection with cases in which it was alleged that atmospheric pollution was taking place. Work was carried out where necessary, and advice on stoking methods given occasionally. Clean Air Act, 1956 In 1953, the Government appointed a Committee on Air Pollution. In the report of this Committee certain areas were defined as "black" and Greater London was one of the areas included. The Committee on Air Pollution recommended the establishment of Smoke Control Areas and during the year under review the Council decided to make investigations with a view to establishing a Smoke Control Area, and with this object in view appointed Smoke Control Enquiry Officer who commenced duties with the department in October, 1958. The area chosen to be surveyed was in Chiswick, comprising 300 acres and bounded by Park Road (east side), from the junction of the Cromwell Road Extension to Burlington Lane and thence from Burlington Lane, eastward on the north side of the Southern Railway line to the River Thames boundary. Thence northwards to the northern boundary of Edensor Gardens, along the south side of Corney Road, across Burlington Lane, along the northern perimeter of Chiswick House Grounds to the junction with the Cromwell Road Extension. This area contains some 706 dwellings and was selected because a large proportion are Council and private houses which do not require extensive adaptation and there are no major redevelopment proposals or necessity for slum clearance. There is only one large industrial firm concerned, and the area could be readily extended. 41 Brentford Gas Works During the latter part of the year the Council asked for a report on the above mentioned works. One of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Alkali etc., Works, subsequently visited the works and as a result of his report was invited to attend a meeting of the Public Health Committee to discuss the matter. 42 GRAPH "C" VARIATION IN AVERAGE MONTHLY CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN BRENTFORD AND CHISWICK DURING 1958 -43- GRAPH "D" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AT BRENTFORD, CHISWICK, CENTRAL LONDON, LEEDS AND LERWICK -44- GRAPH "E" Monthly Deposits of Water Soluble and Water Insoluble Matter in Brentford and Chiswick during 1958 45 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Inspections The total number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 4,622 and the following is a summary of these inspections.

Enquiries-Outstanding Sanitary Notices During the year 1,392 letters were received from other Departments enquiring whether there were any outstanding sanitary notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. SCHOOL SANITATION In previous Annual Reports reference has been made to the sanitary facilities provided for schools in the borough. During the year under review, improved sanitation has been provided in five of the schools of the borough, details of which are as follows:- Ealing Road Junior and Infants’ School Complete new lavatories. Hogarth Infants’ School Moved into new premises September, 1958. Hogarth Junior Mixed School Three quarters of school moved into new premises September, 1958.

WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICES The whole of the district is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board mains. There is one well still in use in the Borough at Green’ s Boathouse, Riverside Lands. This well is used for washing purposes only, drinking water is obtained direct from mains. The mains water supply is satisfactory both in quality and quantity and reports of the bacteriological and chemical analyses carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of by collecting freighters to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough. 48 HOUSING RENT ACT, 1957 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates 29 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates - (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates 32 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 29 (b) in respect of all defects 3 (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 16 (5) Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (6) Number of Certificates issued 17 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates (7) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 15 (8) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 5 (9) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objection (10) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 10 HOUSING ACT, 1949 HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 Number of Grants for Improvements and Conversions 13 HOUSING ACTS 1936/1957 Following the survey of unfit houses in the Borough reported in the years 1954 and 1955, it is now possible to state that work is proceeding in a reasonably rapid manner on the comprehensive inspection and representation of slum properties, with the re-housing of their tenants and with the demolition of the condemned properties.

Conversion of Council Houses In December, 1957, a plan was prepared for the conversion of 10 semidetached houses and 16 end houses in larger blocks in Lionel Road, and six houses in Whitestile Road. The scheme was for the conversion of these 32 premises into flats to double the amount of housing accommodation available on these sites. In 1958, five of the houses in Lionel Road were converted into ten flats, and thirteen premises, lately released from requisition, were purchased by the Council for conversion purposes. The work on these and on the remaining houses of the original scheme was to commence in 1959. Overcrowding Nine cases of alleged overcrowding were investigated by the Department staff during the year. Of these, six were found to be statutorily overcrowded, and were accordingly notified to the Housing Department for consideration by the Housing Committee. It will be seen from the Housing Statistics on page 55 that four cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. Overcrowding is relieved in various ways, by private arrangements made by the families concerned, by Council rehousing, or by Council nomination under the Industrial Selection Scheme for housing in New Towns. DISINFECTION Premises disinfected: Ordinary notifiable diseases 27 Tuberculosis 2 Cancer 4 Premises treated for vermin 24 Premises treated for other pests (wasps, moths, ants and beetles) 13 An arrangement is in force whereby the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee undertakes to carry out emergency disinfection of vermin infested or smallpox-infected clothing and bedding on demand. Routine disinfection of blankets, bedding etc. were carried out on the premises in the above table as required- in addition certain articles of clothing, and parcels of clothing destined for countries abroad, were disinfected. When necessary, books for both public and private libraries are disinfected in the Public Health Department. -56- MISCELLANEOUS RODENT CONTROL During the year 2,920 primary visits and re-visits were made by the Rodent Operatives to premises in the district in connection with rodent disinfestation. The number of premises where treatment was carried out is as follows:- Private Houses 291 Factories 15 Shops 20 Schools 10 In addition to the above, two maintenance treatments to the sewers were carried out under the direction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries during the months of April and October, and the following shows the number of manholes found to be infested.

PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act for the regulation of the sale of pet animals requires all premises in which animals are sold for pets to be licenced by the local authority. Two licences were issued during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Three premises in the Borough are registered for the purpose of the above Act, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 thereof. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Nine establishments were inspected under this heading and all were found to be satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Purpose No. of Licences Massage only - Chiropody only 3 Massage and Chiropody - Massage, Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 1 Massage and Electrical Treatment 3 Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 2 FREE WASHING FACILITIES IN PUBLIC CONVENIENCES Facilities for free hand washing are available in the Kew Bridge both "Ladies'" and "Men's", High Road "Men's" and Turnham Green "Ladies'" Public Conveniences, paper towels and liquid soap in tilting dispensers being available in each. In addition a wash hand basin is provided in the "Ladies'" convenience in Linden Gardens. -57- During the year 1958, 9,900 paper towels were issued. This service has not been so well used this year as nearly 2,000 fewer appear to have been taken than in 1957. In addition those who preferred linen hand towels and tablet soap were able to hire these at a cost of 3d. In the same conveniences 5,163 of these towels were also used. In one other convenience in the Borough - Market Place "Men's and Ladies'", free washing facilities are not available. There is no longer an attendant at this convenience, but it is still kept open weekdays and Sundays from 70 a.m. to 8.0 p.m. pending demolition. This convenience is planned to be demolished in connection with the plan for the redevelopment of the High Street (east of the Courthouse) but it is understood that negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of another site in the rear of Thanet House on the west side of the Courthouse. There are no free washing facilities available at the Edensor Road "Ladies' and Men's" nor at the Turnham Green "Men's" conveniences. RIVER POLLUTION Reports continued to be received every three months from the Officers of Middlesex County Council regarding the condition of the River Brent. Samples were taken at points along the stream from Wembley to Brentford High Street; the two sampling points in the Borough being at Gallows Bridge and Brentford High Street. The results of sampling in 1958 were fairly satisfactory, improving towards the end of the year. No action was required to be taken against persons using the River Brent for unauthorised discharge of sewage or trade effluents during the year. STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district were allocated for street trading purposes, and were frequently visited to ensure that they were being maintained in good condition and in accordance with the Bye-laws. Visits were also paid to the premises of street hawkers who deal in foodstuffs. CANAL BOATS Number of boats on register:- Motor propelled boats 89 Other boats 406 MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF COUNCIL STAFF During 1958, 52 medical examinations of candidates for Council employment were carried out. It was decided during the year that X-ray examination of the chest should become part of the routine medical examination for new entrants to the service -no candidates were found to have abnormal chest symptoms. Pour special examinations were carried out for retirement on grounds of permanent illhealth or on expiration of sick leave entitlement. -58- NUCLEAR RADIATION A public health problem begins to be presented by the rapidly increasing use of radioactive substances. The rapid progress of research and experiment on atomic fission has meant that nuclear power stations, the use of isotopes for industrial measurements and processes, the use of isotopes and of ionising radiations in therapeutics may be building up, however careful the shielding may be, a potentially dangerous amount of radioactivity especially in industrial areas. There is so much uncertainty about the amount of radiation which human beings can endure and so much secrecy with regard to the use of atomic fission material because of its War potential, that Medical Officers of Health find themselves severely handicapped in the advice they can give to anxious enquirers, and there is no doubt that this is causing serious mental disturbance in considerable numbers of the population. Thus two types of observation require to be maintained, to keep watch by enquiry and local monitoring on new sources of radiation and particularly the disposal of waste material from premises using atomic material, and to assess the extent of individual anxieties locally so as to reduce by means of authoritative statements the fears which may produce mental illness. This latter means that Medical Officers of Health should be in a position to say with assurance that local danger does not exist. It is possible to say that in Brentford and Chiswick at the present time there is no excessive radioactivity from any source. In 1958 a small monitor apparatus was purchased for the use of the Health Officers and in addition sampling for radiation was carried out from time to time on the atmospheric pollution deposits from volumetric apparatus in near-by districts. -59- HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee Brentford Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Clayponds Wing (formerly Clayponds Hospital) are situated within the Borough and are administered by the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee under the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946. Brentford Hospital is a cottage type hospital, staffed by general practitioners and visiting consultants, and has 33 beds dealing with general medical and surgical cases. This hospital is now a Training School for assistant nurses in conjunction with South Middlesex Hospital. Chiswick Maternity Hospital which is an integral part of the West Middlesex Hospital has 66 maternity beds and 55 maternity cots, but the actual bed complement is at present reduced to 53 in order that 13 single bedrooms may be available for the staff. It is hoped that this is a temporary expedient only. King Edward Memorial Hospital, Clayponds Wing, has 140 staffed beds and is classified as dealing with orthopaedic, chronic, general medical and surgical cases. It is just within the Borough and is integrated with the King Edward Memorial Hospital at Ealing. The majority of the patients admitted to Clayponds come through the King Edward Memorial Hospital and the remaining patients are admitted through the West Middlesex and Central Middlesex Hospitals. A considerable number of Brentford and Chiswick people receive their hospital treatment at the West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, and the majority of cases of infectious disease requiring hospital isolation are admitted to the South Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth. Chest Clinic patients residing on the north side of the Borough attend the Ealing Chest Clinic for their examinations, X-rays and out-patient treatment, and the patients from the remaining area of the Borough attend the Hounslow Chest Clinic, which is administered by the Staines Group Hospital Management Committee.
