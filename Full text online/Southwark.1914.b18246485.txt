Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my twentyEighth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1914. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough, upon the whole, has been good. Scarlet fever of a mild type was unusually prevalent throughout the year. Several fatal cases of Cerebro-spinal (spotted) fever occurred. An important event of the year was the establishment, on a permanent basis, of the Tuberculosis Dispensary. The examination of foodstuffs in connection with the War necessitated the duplication of the Inspector staff concerned with that work. Much more work was thrown upon the sanitary staff owing to the scarcity of labourers, especially of skilled workers. It has only been with the greatest difficulty that the district has been kept in a fairly good sanitary condition. We have had many changes in the staff owing to so many of the men enlisting. Up to the present the work of the department has been efficiently carried out, and I beg to thank the members for their co-operation. I have also to thank the Council and Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Southwark. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS, 1914. Estimated population 188,321 Total Births 5,604 Total Deaths 3,350 Birth Bate for London 24.3 Do.

The present time is one of such stress and anxiety that it is inadvisable to critically examine the habits and condition of our people. We are all proud of the way the men of Southwark have responded to the national call to serve their country in her hour of peril. We are glad to see that our men possess the same old fighting spirit that won the Peninsular battles. We know our boys will maintain the old reputation. Fortitude and steadfastness should be the motto in our national struggle. Every sound man, irrespective of age, should be making himself fit to fight when the country needs his services. Of the result we need not trouble ourselves if we are doing our duty. The percentage of enlistments for Southwark has been high. At the present time there is no distress in the district, and the families of those at the Front are being well and rightly cared for.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1914 was 5,350, of which 2,731 were males, and 2,619 females. This represents a birth-rate of 28.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 3,255; St. George the Martyr, 1,558; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 537. Of the 5,350 births registered in the borough 67 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the borough. 321 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 67 "outward" transfers are deducted and the 321 "inward" transfers are added to the 5,350 births actually registered in the borough the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 5,604. This gives a corrected birth-rate of 29.7. Birth-rate for the last Twenty-four Years for the Three Division of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George's St. Saviour's and Christchurch.

These deaths in institutions comprised 454 belonging to Southwark, and 706 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,364. Of this very large number, as many as 807 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died in the large public hospitals. When the 739 deaths of those persons who were non-parishoners, but who died in our Borough have been deducted, and the 1,364 "outlying " deaths added, the actual or " corrected " number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,350, of which number 1,792 were males, and 1,558 females. The death-rate when calculated on this " corrected" number is 17 8 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1914, as against a rate of 17 9 for 1913. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 40'7. The various localities in which the " outlying " deaths occurred are shown in the following table. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities Males. Females. Total.

No case of this disease was notified during the year. No death from Small-pox has occurred in the borough in the last ten years. SCARLET FEVER. The increased prevalence of Scarlet Fever in the Borough, commencing in the middle of August, 1913, continued throughout the whole of the year, 1914. It will be seen by the accompanying table that Scarlet Fever was more prevalent in our district during the year under consideration than in any year since 1906. In 1906, 1,470 cases were notified of which 45 were fatal, whilst in the year 1914, 1,448 were notified with 22 deaths. This shews that the disease during the year under consideration must have been of a milder type than that in the year 1906, as the treatment of the cases in the two years was of the same character. In the five years preceding 1914, Scarlet Fever had considerably declined both in the number of cases notified and in its fatality, so that at the commencement of the outbreak in the autumn of 1913, we must have had in the district a large number of susceptible children. The disease being of a mild type large numbers were unrecognised until the "peeling" stage, when the cases had spread the disease far and wide. In one case a boy, attendant at a picture palace, had been during the course of his complaint going on with his duties. This case was the centre of a large outbreak before it was discovered. In a densely populated district such as Southwark, it is very difficult to discover very mild cases, especially in those who go to work. The verminous state of houses in my opinion is the cause of the spread of this and similar diseases. The usual vermin, it is thought, carry the infection from person to person. Municipal cleansing of the home and person in the poorer districts appears to be the most economical treatment in the prevention of these diseases. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 1405 cases sent to hospital numbered 2], a mortality of 1.5 per cent. In the 43 cases treated at home, there was one death, a percentage of 2.3. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. The annual death-rate per 1,000 was 0.12. DIPHTHERIA. There has been a further slight increase in the number of notified cases of the disease, and when compared with the preceding years, the number of cases is the highest since 1907. The number of fatal cases has much increased in the year under consideration, especially when compared with last year, which was in regard to fatal cases, the lowest on record. The cases were evenly distributed throughout the Borough. The wards most affected were St. Peter, St. Michael, All Saints' and St. Paul. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup was 338, as against 327 for last year. The deaths from the disease numbered 37, as against 19 for 1913. 56 The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 11.0. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.20. The number of cases notified as compare 1 with London, during the last ten years was :— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The wards most affected were in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever in the borough during the year numbered 2, as against 6, 4 and 5. in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 24 for the present year, and 39, 39 and 45, for the three preceding years. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.01. 57 The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1905 74 1910 54 1906 111 1911 45 1907 80 1912 39 1908 48 1913 39 1909 35 1914 24 The number of deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1905 11 1910 7 1906 21 1911 5 1907 11 1912 4 1908 6 1913 6 1909 6 1914 2 Of the 24 cases notified the whole were removed to hospital—2 died, a mortality of 8.3 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 100.0. The wards most affected were St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Michael, St. Jude and St. Saviour. In a large proportion of the cases the patients took their meals away from home, and not always at the same place. The tracing the disease to any particular food was in consequence very difficult and sometimes quite impossible. In three cases it was thought that shell fish was the cause. Mussels and cockles are dangerous shell fish, especially, when eaten raw, as is so often the case. One case arose whilst "hopping" in Kent. Another whilst in camp at St. Alban's. It may safely be said that very few cases arise, apart from the eating of shell fish. MEASLES. All the usual measures taken in connection with Public Health administration together with School care, appear to have no effect whatever in lessening the number of cases of Measles occurring in districts in which the most elaborate preventive machinery has been set up. We all know it is quite the exception to meet with an individual of adult age who has not had Measles. What, however, can be said is that 58 the effect of the proper care and treatment of the cases is seen in a diminished mortality. Whatever is the percentage of the fatal cases to the number attacked, we all feel that it is much too high and is largely due to the crowded home and the absence of proper nursing care. We may ask again the old question, " what is going to diminish the spread of Measles?" We may easily say the cleanliness and the ventilation of the home is one cardinal point. I have thought for years that vermin such as bugs, fleas and lice play a very important part in the propagation of Measles, Scarlet Fever and kindred diseases. I may say that much of the sanitary work in Southwark is directed to the ridding our houses of such vermin. Our houses are cleaner than they were years ago, yet there is still in that respect much to be done. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1905 154 1910 225 1906 95 1911 120 1907 112 1912 139 1908 77 1913 105 1909 127 1914 95 The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.51. WHOOPING COUGH. This disease for some years, as will be seen by the accompanying Table has averaged 55 deaths in the year. No serious rise has occurred since 1907. The course of the complaint is a protracted one, and is very little influenced by Public Health measures. The deaths from this disease were 59 for the year. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.31. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1905 80 1910 60 1906 54 1911 64 1907 103 1912 49 1908 50 1913 38 1909 57 1914 59 59 CEREBRO-SPINAL FEYER. During the year 6 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, all of which died. DIARRHÆA. The year under consideration was unfavourable for infants especially in regard to Diarrhœa. The deaths from that disease were above the average. All the cases were visited and inquired into. Breast feeding of babies was recommended by circularising and visiting as usual. In the poorer parts of the borough the leaflet "Precautions to be taken to prevent Summer Diarrhoea'' was widely distributed. The annual death-rate from Diarrhœa per 1,000 living was 1.10. Deaths from diarrhœa during the last ten years: — 1905 183 1910 90 1906 225 1911 331 1907 101 1912 95 1908 188 1913 205 1909 113 1914 207 HEALTH WORK.

Miss Reddoch reports that she has completed the first year's history of 2,005 infants born during the year 1913. She has divided them into three groups, as follows :— (a) Particulars respecting 1,058 infants alive at the end of one year; (b) Particulars respecting 720 infants who were removed from Southwark; and (c) Particulars respecting 227 infants who died under one year. It will be seen that a very small percentage of the infants born in the borough are artificially fed. Of the 2,005 infants under consideration 227 died, showing an infant death-rate of 113 per 1,000 births of those whose history has been followed. This is a satisfactory infant death-rate when compared with the infant death-rate of the borough, which is 123 per 1,000. TABLE 33.

During the twelve months ending December 31st, 1914, 729 families have been visited, 547 being in St. John's Ward and 182 in St. Mary's Ward. Records of these have been made on the cards used in the Public Health Department, to be returned to the Medical Officer at the end of one year. Duplicates are retained for reference until the child is of school age. 261 pre-natal cases have received care for some weeks, sometimes months, before the birth of the child. 729 infants were visited periodically during the year. 4 cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum, requiring much attention were visited. 63 38 deaths of infants occurred from causes accurately known to the Medical Officer, and nearly all within the first fortnight of their lives. There has been no epidemic amongst infants, though there were many cases of summer diarrhœa in September with 4 deaths. Bronchitis and pneumonia have been prevalent since the autumn, but the 4 deaths from this cause occurred early in the year. This particular form of illness seems very common, too, among the parents. 76 names have been removed from the register owing to removal to other districts. When possible, these have been transferred to the local visitors, and every effort is made not to lose sight of them. The great majority of babies are breast-fed, the mothers being encouraged by all means to continue this—if not wholly—then partially; cow's milk or some form of dried milk being used as an alternative. Great watchfulness has been exercised over the artificially fed babies with excellent results. The Weighing Centre, having now 69 mothers in attendance, helps greatly in keeping up the interest in the babies' welfare. The weights are recorded every week : or in cases of older children, at longer intervals. The health of both mothers and babies is discussed at these gatherings, and if there is any sign of flagging, the doctor may be consulted the next day. At these consultations careful inquiry is made into the family history of each patient to find the cause of the backwardness. If necessary, the mother is sent to her doctor or to a hospital for treatment either for herself or the child. Simple cases of improper or irregular feeding are left in the hands of the visitors. No medical treatment is given at the Centre. Many backward babies have made conspicuous improvement under this care. Malnutrition of the nursing mothers has been remedied by sending them to the Invalid Kitchen for dinners, and in some cases milk has been supplied. Convalescent Treatment has been given to nine mothers, who, with their young babies, have been sent for a fortnight's holiday, with good results in every case. Sanitary Defects in the homes of mothers with young children have been remedied immediately on their being brought to the notice of the Medical Officer. There have been 12 such instances. 64 TABLE 34. Return of Families Admitted into the Council's Reception House during the year 1914. 1914. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever.

Of this number 2,311 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 1,484 rooms in 1913. 5,768 periodical sprayings of rooms occupied by Phthisical patients were also carried out during the year. 1,292 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year, as against 1,224 in 1913. Among the total number of disinfections (9,371) it was found necessary to strip 722 rooms. Of these 572 were in relation to the notifiable diseases, 147 after the termination of cases of Phthisis, and 3 were verminous. TABLE 35. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected.

During the year 2755 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street, as against 2.604 persons cleansed during the year 1913. Under our agreement with the London County Council, 2,662 children were cleansed, as against 2,532 cleansed during 1913. It was found necessary in a large number of cases to treat the children twice and sometimes three or four times before they were found to be effectually cleansed. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 93 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 72 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1913. 69 TABLE 40.

Town Hall, Southwark. GEORGE B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. 166 167 APPENDIX. REPORT OF THE TUBERCULOSIS OFFICER. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. May 1st to December 31st, 1914. I beg to present my report on the work of the Tuberculosis Dispensary from May 1st to December 31st, 1914. On May 1st I undertook my duties as Tuberculosis Officer in the service of the Borough Council, and from that period until December 31st the work was carried on in the temporary premises at the Reception House in King James Street. During that period a Secretary-Dispenser has been appointed, whose duties include the keeping of the necessary records and registers, the shorthand and typewriting, and the compounding of medicines, with the charge of the Dispensary. Two Nurses have been appointed whose duties are to attend the Dispensary during the hours at which the patients are seen, to take the histories of patients, their family histories, weigh them, and keep records of their temperatures. At other times to visit the patients' homes, give the necessary advice to each case, distribute sputum flasks and leaflets of instructions, and induce as far as possible the contacts of the cases to undergo examination for the detection of early disease. The patients receive instruction as to the best methods of disposal of sputum, and by these means it is intended to check the spread of the disease. Of the contact cases examined, undetected infection by the tubercule bacillus was found in 11.2 per cent. of the cases, and early and suitable treatment advised. Owing to the necessity of using the Reception House for its original purpose and the growth of the work, new premises were acquired, and they were opened on January 1st, 1915, at 82 and 84, Newington Causeway. There is ample accommodation, and the premises are in every way suitable for the purpose, and will allow of extension as necessity arises. The more scientific tests are applied in doubtful cases, and every facility is given to practitioners to avail themselves of the services of the dispensary for consultations, or to have these tests applied. 168 Patients returning from institutions are kept under supervision and attend periodically for examination. By arrangement with the London Insurance Committee insured persons are examined, treated and reported on, or referred after examination to suitable institutions, and by a subsequent arrangement the same is done for non-insured persons of all ages by agreement with the London County Council, who also now provide residential accommodation for suitable cases. In addition, considerable voluntary help has been given by the Charity Organisation Society, Invalid Children's Aid Society, The Invalid Dinners Association, and the Borough of Southwark Health Society who have willingly co-operated with the Dispensary, and whose valuable work has been greatly appreciated. I have pleasure in appending some tables of statistics, showing to some extent the amount of work done during the eight months since my appointment. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HORACE WILSON. TABLE B. Insured persons dealt with to December 31st, 1914:— Sex. Totals. Discharged from Dispensary. Dead. Improved. Not improved.
