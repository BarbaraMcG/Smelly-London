In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an Abstract of their Accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1883. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry have appended to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners of Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the Parish is interested. THE PARISH occupies an area of 164 acres (or, according to the report of the Registrar-General, 162 acres), and was formed by Act of Parliament in the year 1685, out of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields. At the last census (April, 1881) the resident population was ascertained to be 29,865, and the number of occupied houses 3,018. 14 Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 18. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylums District. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been subdivided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A., is Rector. Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St. James forms a part of the Borough of Westminster, which returns two members to Parliament, the sitting members being the Right Hon. W. H. Smith and Lord Algernon Percy. The Register prepared in 1883 contains the names of 8,630 electors, viz., 5 on the Scot and Lot List, 423 lodgers, and 3,202 possessing other qualifications. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are elected by the ratepayers of the Division. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). Water is supplied by four companies, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follows:— 1. Chelsea Water Works Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the west side of Poland Street, Cambridge Street, Little Windmill Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. 15 3. Grand Junction Water Works Company (Chief Office, 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and north of the centre of Pali Mall. 4. West Middlesex Water Works Company (Chief Office, 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. The authorized scale of charges for the supply of water is given on page 63. The Coroner is Mr. Charles St. Clare Bedford, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths, the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The Registrar is Mr. T. M. Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. WARDS. For the election of Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts, the Parish has been divided into four Wards, under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the boundaries thereof being described in the official division of the Parish into Wards under the said Act, as follows:— Ward No. 1 (Great Marlborough)— All such parts of the Parish of Saint James, Westminster, as he upon the left-hand side, that is to say, upon the side lying towards the north and north-east of the following boundary line, that is to say, a line commencing upon the western boundary of the said Parish in Swallow Passage, and drawn in an easterly direction immediately at the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the south-west portion of the Regent (Oxford Street) Circus, thence across Regent Street, to and along the southern party-wall of No. 268, Regent Circus, and thence along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the south side of Oxford Street, across Argyll Street to the back of the tenements or premises forming the east side of Argyll Street; then turning south along the backs of the said several tenements or premises forming the east side of Argyll Street, and of the several tenements or premises in Great Marlborough Street forming the east 16 side of the block of buildings betwee Argyll Place and Little Marlborough Street, then turning east across Carnaby Street, to and along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the north side of Tyler's Court and Little Marshall Street, thence turning south along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the east side of Marshall Street, to and turning east along the backs of the several premises forming the south side of Broad Street, to and drawn south along the backs" of the several tenements or premises forming the west side of Cambridge Street, of Little Windmill Street, and of Great Windmill Street, passing at the backs of the several tenements and premises forming Angel Court, Bull Yard, and Ham Yard respectively, and thence to the parish boundary at the angle thereof at the intersection of Coventry Street and the Haymarket.

Ward No. 4 (Golden Square)— All parts of the said Parish of Saint James, Westminster, not included in the Wards hereinbefore particularly described. 18 THE VESTRY Consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio Members, and was constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. It superseded an elected Vestry acting under the provisions of the Statute 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. All the powers of the former Vestry and of the Paving Commissioners acting under Local Acts, as well as some of the functions of the Commissioners of Sewers, were transferred to the newly-appointed body. An Act was passed in the year 1858 relative to the main drainage of the Metropolis, by which the Vestry, as the rating authority of the Parish, were required to meet precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works for a Main Drainage Rate not to exceed 2d. in the pound per annum. In 1862, the powers of the Vestry were enlarged by the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, and in the following year turnpike roads in the Metropolis were transferred from Commissioners, who had power to levy tolls upon horses and other animals and vehicles, to the Local Authorities, whose expenses are defrayed from rates. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1869, and Money Acts of the Board, subsequently passed, besides makingsome alterations in the mode of assessing the expenses of the Board, have afforded increased facilities for the raising of money by Vestries and District Boards, of which, however, the Vestry of St. James have not had occasion to avail themselves. The Vestry have also various powers under the Metropolitan Paving Act, 57 Geo. III., cap. 29, commonly known as Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, the Nuisances Removal Acts, the Metropolitan Building Acts, the Metropolis Gas Act, the Sanitary Act, 1866, the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, better known as Torrens' Act, and other statutes. By the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879, the Vestry are empowered to purchase samples of food and drugs for 19 analysis, to appoint a Public Analyst, and to prosecute vendors of adulterated articles. Proceedings under these Aets during the past year are mentioned on page 70. There has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes over the expenditure of which local authorities do not possess the slightest control. Thus, since the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855, the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main drainage ; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges— purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes. A statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes is given on page 34. STANDING ORDERS. Operative Resolutions in the nature of Standing Orders have been passed during the year as follows:— 4th April, 1883.—That the payment for overtime in the Works Department be discontinued (W. 7, p. 286). 2nd May, 1883.—That the Foreman be instructed to inspect the sweeping machines every morning before the same are put to work.—(W. 7, p. 301). 10th May, 1883.—That the driver of the horse-broom be paid overtime when engaged in washing the wood pavement at night (V. 13, p. 443). 10th May, 1883.—That, it appearing some of the men employed by the Vestry have undertaken Contracts on their own account, the servants of the Yestry be required forthwith to discontinue such a practice (V. 13, p. 443). 29th June, 1883.—That orders for disinfectants and all such goods be given by the Yestry Clerk, upon the written requisitions of the head of the Department for which the same are required (S. 2, p. 81). 12th June, 1883.—That balances from cheques for wages be repaid to the Treasurer before each ordinary meeting of the Finance Committee (F. 5, p. 266). 27th June, 1883.—That the time made by each workman in the service of the Vestry be specified in hours (W. 7, p. 322). » 20 12th July, 1883.—That a time-book be provided for signature by the Stoneyard Clerk and men employed or assembling at the Stoneyard (W. 7, p. 330). 20th December, 1883.—That the foreman be instructed to specially report to the Surveyor all apparent breaches of the Contract for Slopping and Street Watering, with a view to the same being investigated, and, if necessary, reported to the Vestry, in order that the stipulated fines may be enforced if deemed expedient (V. 14, p. 99). 20th December, 1883.—That all orders given to the Contractors and reports made to the Committees and Chief Officers be in writing (V. 14, p. 100). 21st February, 1884.—That with a view to the more easy recovery of rates assessed upon premises, the names of sub-tenants be inserted in the rate-book in future where necessary (F. 6, p. 7). 28th February, 1884.—That each Inspector of Nuisances be provided with a set of keys for the mortuary, and held responsible for all business relating to the mortuary which may arise in his district (V. 14, p. 164). 19th March, 1884.—That it be an instruction to the Surveyor to see that the horse-brooms are thoroughly over-hauled and properlyoiled once a week (W. 8, p. 115). A complete list of operative resolutions now in force has been prepared. THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS was held on Monday, the 28th day of May, the places appointed for the purpose being—Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Rooms, Kingp Street; Church Ward, Vestry Hall, Piccadilly; Golden Square, Ward, National School House, Marshall Street ; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. The total expense of conducting the election, including the hire of rooms, publication of notices, and taking a poll in Great Marlborough Ward, amounted to £10 18s. 6d., and an order for payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was accordingly made by the Vestry in accordance with the Statute. Compared with former years increased interest was exhibited at the election in each Ward, although a very large proportion of 21 duly qualified electors abstained from taking part in the proceedings. Public notice is given of the time and place of these elections, and the Vestry regret that so many of the parishioners display such apathy in the constitution of the local boards. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. CHURCHWARDENS were elected on the 29th day of March, when Mr. Frederick Crane, of 55,"Regent Street, and Mr. William Cox, of 57, Pall Mall, were again unanimously chosen to fill this ancient office. SIDESMEN were elected by the Vestry on the 29th day of March, the undermentioned gentlemen being selected to fill the office:— Mr. James Thomas Robertson, 7, St. James's Street. Mr. Samuel Morle, 102, Jermyn Street. Mr. Robert Gurnev Barclay, 69, Pall Mall. Mr. William Jenkins, 3, St. James's Place. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. Eight parishioners were nominated by the Vestry on the 29th of March, 1883, to serve as Overseers of the Poor. The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by the Justices of the Peace at a Petty Sessions held on the 6th April, to act as Overseers for the year 1883-4, were:— Mr. John Malin, 117, Jermyn Street. Mr. Richard Jeffs, 244, Regent Street. Mr. Frederick Jenkins, 4 and 5, St. James's Place. Mr. George Timms, 91 and 92, Jermyn Street. GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS OF THE POOR. By a Local Act, 2 Geo. III, cap. 58, the Vestry, are required to meet on some day in Easter-weelc annually and appoint twentyone "substantial and discreet" persons, either from their own 22 body, or from among the Justices of the Peace for Middlesex or Westminster, or other "creditable inhabitants" of the Parish, such persons, together with the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor, to be called Governors and Directors of the Poor. This Board formerly exercised extensive powers, of which they have from time to time been relieved by subsequent legislation, and their principal functions are at present confined to paying from the Poor Rate, various sums upon the precept of the Guardians and other Authorities. On the 29th March, 1883, the Vestry appointed twenty-one inhabitants of the Parish to act as Governors and Directors of the Poor, in accordance with the provisions of the above-mentioned Act of Parliament, and a list of the gentlemen so appointed is given on page 11. A statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Board will be found on page 114. ST. JAMES'S CHAPEL AND BURIAL GROUND. The London and North Western Railway Company having promoted a Bill in Parliament for obtaining power (among other matters) to acquire the disused Burial Ground in Hampstead Road, belonging to this Parish, considerable opposition was manifested to the scheme. The ground is vested by a special Act of Parliament in the Rector and Churchwardens, and placed under the management of ten Trustees, eight of whom are elected by the Vestry, and two, the Rector and the Senior Churchwarden, are ex officio. Some negotiations had taken place between the Trustees and the Railway Company before the matter was brought under the notice of the Vestry, the Trustees having in the interests of the Parish entered into an agreement with the Company, by which the extent of land to be taken by the latter was limited to two-thirds of the Burial Ground, although the whole ground was scheduled in the Parliamentary Notices relating to the Bill. The Vestry did not consider this arrangement altogether satisfactory, and accordingly convened a public meeting of the parishioners to consider the whole subject. 23 This meeting was held on the 7th May, Mr. T. Jay, of Regent Street, being elected chairman. Resolutions were passed condemning the scheme of the Railway Company, and asking various members of both Houses of Parliament, who were interested in the matter, to watch the Bill and endeavour either to reject the proposal altogether, or to restrict the area of ground to be acquired by the Company to the smallest possible limits, having regard to the absolute requirements of the Company for public or quasi public purposes. The Bill was considerably altered in Committee of the House of Commons, and was subsequently again altered in the Lords, the final result being that the extent of the ground to be taken by the Company was limited to 3,950 yards, or less than one-fourth of the whole area, part of which was to be devoted to the formation of a new street in lieu of a thoroughfare to be closed. The price to be paid by the Company was fixed at £8,000, and the remainder of the ground was to be conveyed, without further consideration, to the Yestry of St. Pancras, and to be laid out and maintained by them, for ever, as an open space for the use of the public. Possession of the Burial Ground was given to the Railway Company and the St. Pancras Yestry on the 1st February, and the purchase-money received from the Company, which has been paid into court, as provided by the Act, is to be devoted to such ecclesiastical, parochial, and other purposes, for the benefit of the Parish of St. James as the Trustees, with the sanction of the Yestry, may direct; the Yestry have approved the proposal of the Trustees to apportion the sum equally between ecclesiastical and secular objects, but the precise purposes to which the money is to be applied are still under consideration. ARCHBISHOP TENISON'S UNITED SCHOOLS for the Parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St..James, are governed by a Board of Trustees, of whom three are elected by the Vestry of this Parish. The Trustees so elected are, at the 24 present time, Mr. F. Crane, Mr. T. H. W. Anderson, and Mr. H. Graves. A copy of the Accounts of the School for the year 1883 is given on page 116. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. Two of the Governors of this School are elected by the Vestry. No vacancy has occured during the year, consequently Mr. T. H. Elam and Mr. William Cox continue to represent the Vestry upon the Trust. A copy of the Accounts of the School for the year 1883 is given on page 117. CRAVEN PEST-HOUSE CHARITY. This Charity dates from the year 1687, and originated in the gift by William Earl Craven of certain property demised for the benefit of poor persons suffering from the plague. The Charity is now administered under a scheme established by the Court of Chancery in the year 1868, and the endowment is described in the Order of the Court as consisting of 13 houses in Craven Hill Gardens, Paddington, and 7 coach-houses in Craven Mews, producing rentals amounting in all to £183 14s. 0d. per annum ; the sum of £15,537 in cash being the purchase-money of the premises in that neighbourhood acquired by the Metropolitan Railway Company, and £395 7s. 8d. Bank £3 per cent. Annuities remaining on the credit of " Attorney-General v. Earl Craven." The net income of the Charity is applied in specified proportions to the funds of King's College Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital, the Governors of the former being required in consideration thereof to set apart 24 beds, and the Governors of the latter 16 beds, for patients sent by the Trustees of the Craven Charity. In addition to reserving this number of beds, the Governors of each of the hospitals named are also required to receive and treat as out-patients all poor persons resident in the parishes benefited by the Charity, who may be sent by the Trustees. 25 Under the above-mentioned scheme, this Parish, as well as the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields; St. George, Hanover Square; St. Clement Danes; and St. Paul, Covent Garden, participate in the benefits of the Chaiity. Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry; the present Trustees so appointed being Mr. F. Crane, Mr. A. T. Spryng, Mr. R. Jeffs, and Mr. J. Bonthron. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1883 is given on page 118. PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's. It arises from a bequest, in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are, or have been, housekeepers in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity consists of £9,969 2s. 9d. New Three per Cent. Annuities, and the following is a statement of the amount received and expended during the past year:— Receipts. Expenditure. £ s. d. £ s. d Dividends on Stock 299 1 6 Cost of printing forms of Amount received as interest petition and lists of for time Dividends were applicants 4 18 3 placed on deposit 1 18 5 Amount paid to 20 poor persons— (£14 16s. 1d. each) 296 1 & £300 19 11 £300 19 11 The twenty recipients were selected by the Vestry from forty-six applicants, after a careful investigation of each case. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on pages 119 to 123. 26 PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses are appointed by the Yestry. They are seven in number, and one third, or as near as may be, retire annually, but are eligible for re-election. The Commissioners retiring in January last were Mr. William Cox, of 57, Pall Mall, and Mr. William Winnett, of 51 and 53, Wardour Street. Both these gentlemen were re-elected for the usual term of office. A return recently prepared shows that from the adoption of the Baths and Wash-houses Act in 1846 to Christmas last, the sum ox £32,286 12s. 9d. has been paid from the Poor Rates, and surplus receipts, amounting to £9,350 have been applied in aid of the Poor Rates, making a net charge on the rates of £22,936 12s. 9d. The sum of £21,000 was borrowed for the erection, fitting-up, and subsequent enlargement of the building, of which amount only £1,400 now remains due. As some indication of the usefulness of the institution, it may be noted that no less than £94,612 19s. 0d. has been received from bathers and washers, from the opening of the establishment in June, 1852 to Christmas, 1883. A statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Commissioners for the past year is given on page 113. BEADLE. The Vestry are authorised by Statute (8 Geo. II, cap. 15) to appoint Watchmen and Beadles for the Parish, and although the appointment of Watchmen long since fell into desuetude, one or more Beadles were appointed annually until the year 1882. On the question of appointing beadles being brought forward, according to custom, on the 7th June, 1883, the following resolution was passed, and no appointment was made:— " That it is not expedient to proceed to the appointment of a beadle under the provisions of the Local Act, 8 Geo. II, inasmuch as subsequent legislation has fully provided for the performance of all the duties of a beadle contemplated by the said Act." 27 REPRESENTATIVE AT THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. One member of the Metropolitan Board of Works is elected by the Vestry of St. James, under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. The term for which Mr. Thomas Henry Elam had been elected expired on the 13th June, and a largely-attended meeting of the Vestry was held on the following day to supply the vacancy thus caused. The Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A., the Rector, presided, and Mr. Elam was again unanimously re-elected for the further period of three years, with an expression of the Vestry's appreciation of the able manner in which he has represented them since the year 1877. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 31 Finance and House Committee 24 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 21 Works and Improvements Committee 32 Lighting Committee 21 Special and Sub-Committees 28 Total 160 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings, but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Four Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the bye-laws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees areappointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. 28 OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. It will be seen from the subjoined remarks that considerable changes in the official staff of the Vestry have occurred during the past year. Vestry Clerk's Department.—Mr James Plater, who had been in the Vestry Clerk's Office for about three years, and had only recently been promoted to the position of First Assistant, died on the 1st July, after a short illness. During the interval, in 1882, between the death of Mr. Buzzard, the late Vestry Clerk, and the appointment of his successor, Mr. Plater displayed considerable ability in carrying on the necessary work of the Vestry, and gave promise of becoming a proficient and valuable officer. The vacancy created by the death of Mr. Plater was filled by the promotion of Mr. Brooker, his salary being immediately increased from £70 to £85, and further increased at Christmas to £100 a year. Mr. J. M. Crow was appointed General Office Clerk, at a salary of £65 a year. Surveyor's Department.— The engagement of Mr. A. P. Howell, the late Surveyor, terminated at Midsummer, and a superannuation allowance of £100 was granted to him. Fifty-one applications for the appointment of Surveyor were received in response to the Vestry's advertisement, and twelve candidates were selected for a personal interview, the choice of the Vestry ultimately falling upon Mr. Henry Monson, Assistant Surveyor to the Acton Local Board. A new Foreman of Sweepers was appointed in July to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of the foreman who had been appointed in the previous year. The resignation of the Stoneyard Clerk has also been accepted. Sanitary Department.—In consequence of failing health and increasing years, Mr. J. H. Morgan, who had held the office of Sanitary Inspector for 27 years, tendered his resignation, which was accepted with much regret by the Vestry, who felt that they were thus deprived of the valuable services of an experienced and upright officer. A superannuation allowance of £86 6s. 8d. per 29 annum, being the maximum allowed by law, was unanimously granted to Mr. Morgan on the 29th November. A special Committee was appointed to consider the arrangements necessary to be made consequent upon the retirement of Mr. Morgan. After much deliberation the Committee recommended that the offices hitherto known as that of "Sanitary Inspector" and "Inspector of Nuisances," and held by separate persons, should be amalgamated under the latter title, and this recommendation was adopted by the Vestry, the duties being defined generally as follows :— 1. To inspect streets and premises where a nuisance exists, or may be reasonably supposed to exist. 2. To serve preliminary notices for the removal of nuisances (including dust, manure, and other refuse), the amendment, re-construction, or abolition of defective drains; for providing, renewing, or improving the water supply to any premises, or part thereof; and for the removal or alteration of projections or obstructions, whether permanent or temporary, in any street or public place. 3. To report daily proceedings to the Medical Officer of Health as regards nuisances, and to the Surveyor as regards drainage, obstructions, projections (including private lamps), &c. 4. To purchase samples of food and drugs for analysis, and deliver same to the Public Analyst. 5. To take an oversight of the mortuary, and of the work of disinfecting. 6. To keep such records and books as may be necessary. 7. To superintend the cleansing and disinfection of public urinals by men employed and paid as scavengers. 8. To take notice of all defects in the pavement of roads and footways, note all defective street lights, read and record the gas meters to public lamps, and water meters to urinals, note all hoards, scaffolds, &c., erected in any part of the parish, and report on all these matters to the Surveyor. 9. To serve notices for the re-instatement of dangerous or defective coal-plates, area gratings, private pavements, &c., and report thereon to the Surveyor. Subsequently the Parish was divided into two districts for the purposes of sanitny inspection, and Mr. W. H. Watson was appointed to one of them at his present salary of £120 per annum, 30 and Mr. E. Brooks, formerly Assistant Inspector, was appointed to the other at a salary of £100 per annum, increasing by ,£10 a year for two years. Both Inspectors have been put in uniform, for the two-fold purpose of exhibiting their position and protecting parishioners from fraud by persons falsely representing themselves to be Inspectors. A special grant of £10 was made to Mr. Brooks in recognition of the extra services rendered by him during the reorganization of the Sanitary Staff. Superannuation Allowances.—In addition to the allowances mentioned above, the grant of £50 per annum to Mr. A. Clark, late Rate Collector, has been continued for a further period of one year. A list of the officers of the Vestry and their respective salaries is given on page 105. FINANCIAL. It will be seen on reference to the accounts given on page 100, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurers hands amounting to £5,578 18s. 4d. The sum of £70,566 7s. 2d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £61,538 18s. 0d., leaving a balance of £14,606 7s. 6d. on the 25th March, 1884. Against this cash balance, however, there were on the lastmentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £11,065 5s. 2d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £960 16s. 10d., leaving a surplus of £4,501 19s. 2d. to be carried to the credit of the present year. Although the same gentleman acts as Treasurer both for the Poor Rate and the Vestry Rates, the Vestry are compelled to make a separate appointment of Treasurer for each Account, in consequence of the moneys being administered and audited under different Acts of Parliament. It frequently happens that there is a balance to the credit of one Account, while the other is overdrawn, and the charge for interest being higher than the rate allowed on the credit balance, the Parish has sustained a loss owing to the 31 Vestry not being able to amalgamate the two Accounts. On this being represented to the Treasurer, he readily assented to an arrangement proposed by the Vestry last year, by which a balance on one account may be set against the overdraft on the other. It is believed that by this means a large annual saving in the charge for interest will be effected. LOANS. The only loan now outstanding is the sum of £4,571 8s. 6d., being the balance of the loan of £8,000 taken up in the year 1880, for wood paving works in Regent Street (Oxford Street to Piccadilly Circus). The loan is secured by mortgage of the General Rates, and the final payment in respect thereof becomes due in 1887. COLLECTION OF TAXES. The Chancellor of the Exchequer having made a proposal in the House of Commons to transfer the collection of the IncomeTax from local collectors to officers appointed and controlled by the Excise Department, the Vestry requested the Members of Parliament for Westminster to offer the proposal their strenuous opposition, and suggested to the other Local Authorities throughout the Metropolis the adoption of a similar course. The grounds of the objection taken by the Vestry were that not only is local knowledge essential to prevent unnecessarily harsh measures being adopted in enforcing payment of taxes, but that it is also useful in preventing frauds on the Revenue. Before the Bill dealing with the subject was brought on for discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer intimated that the Government had abandoned their intention to make the contemplated change. RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value, according to the last quinquennial re-valuation of the whole Parish in 1880, amounted to £666,813. This amount has since been increased by three supplemental valuation lists, and 32 the total rateable value, as amended by the list coming into force on the 6th April, 1884, is £680,312. The increase each year since 1880 has been as follows:— Supplemental List, 6th April, 1882 £2,086 „ 1883 1,359 „ 1884 10,054 £13,499 RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows:— Amount in the Pound. S. d. Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police, County, and Lunatic Asylums Rates, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) 1 9 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, precepts of the School Board for London, and proportion of the Bridge Expenses of the Metropolitan Board of Works 1 6 Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1 Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, for meeting the precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works, so far as relates to the Fire Brigade, Main Drainage, Metropolitan Improvements, and general expenses of the Board 0 6 Total 3 10 33 The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate— £ s. d. Amount of rate as levied 59,656 10 9 Arrears of former rates 837 11 6 Rates on property assessed during the year 448 15 9 £60,942 18 0 Collected 58,281 1 11 Loss from empty houses, &c. 2,330 14 1 Arrears at close of year 331 2 0 £60,942 18 0 Other Parochial Rates— Amount of rates as levied 71,019 13 9 Arrears of former rates 979 11 0 Rates on property assessed during the year 534 1 11 £72,533 6 8 Collected 69,322 10 10 Loss from empty houses, &c 2,823 1 4 Arrears at close of year 387 14 6 £72,533 6 8 Under the provisions of the Local Acts of Parliament relating to the Parish of St. James, the rates are made annually, but are recoverable by four quarterly instalments. For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In addition to issuing about the usual number of summonses for the recovery of rates and obtaining distress warrants, as customary, The Vestry have been compelled to resort to the extreme measure of applying for warrants of commitment to prison in default of distress in 3 cases. It is anticipated that the Bills of Sale Amendment Act, 1882, which provides that Bills of Sale shall not avail against distress for rates, will reduce materially the number of warrants of commitment, as Bills of Sale given before the passing of the Act fall in. 34 In view of the increasing demands by central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry do not possess any control, although for economy in collection, the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers:— Total amount expended, £119,704 18s. 3d. Under control of Local Authority. Not under control of Local Authority. Poor Rate:— £ s. d. Poor Rate:— £ s. d. Expended by Guardians of the Poor in relief, &c 20,227 1 4 Metropolitan Asylums District 8,714 10 7 Central London Sick Asylum 3,242 0 0 Registration of Voters, Printing, Cost of Collection 902 12 11 Metropolitan Common Poor Fund 6,891 2 9 General and Sewers Police 14,145 4 8 Rates:- County & Lunatic Asylums Rates 4,189 2 2 Paving, Scavenging, Cleansing, &c., Local Sewers, and Administration Expenses 24,735 3 7 General Rate :— Expenses of School Board 19,074 14 10 Metropolitan solidated Rate :— Expenses of Metropolitan Board of Works 17,583 5 5 £45,864 17 10 £73,840 0 5 The payments to Central Authorities last year amounted to £1,859 15s. 0d. more than for the previous year, and it will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £73,840 s. 5d. of the total of £119,704 18s. 3d. having been paid over during the year to various Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. The efforts of the Vestry to reduce the rates by an economical administration in local affairs are thus to a large extent neutralised by the growing expenditure of Central Authorities. 35 The following statement illustrates the enormous increase in the demands of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London during the last ten years:— 1874-5 1875-6 1876-7 1877-8 1878-9 1879-80 1880-1 1881-2 1882-3 1883-4 Metropolitan Board of Works 9,577 11,681 10,956 11,442 11,594 14,008 15,357 16,546 17,614 17,583 School Board for London 5,153 6,705 9,974 12,364 12,195 13,115 15,064 15,941 16,466 19,075 Total 14,730 18,386 20,930 23,806 23,789 27,123 30,421 32,487 34,080 36,658 The total amount raised with the local rates for these two Boards alone, during the ten years, is £262,410, being an average of £26,241 per annum. These precepts, which in the year 1874-5 represented a rate of 6¾d. in the pound, had increased to a rate of a fraction under 1s. 1d. in the pound in 1883-4, and in actual amount have more than doubled in ten years. The precepts for the year 1884-5 show a further increase of £778 in the demand of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and £4,253 in that of the School Board for London. The amount required by the last mentioned Board represents a rate of nearly 8d. in the pound for the year, as compared with about 6d. for 1883-4. VESTRY PROPERTY. Twenty-two years having elapsed since the erection of the Vestry Hall and Offices, and a very small amount of painting and repairs having been carried out in the meantime, the Vestry caused the building, early in the year, to be thoroughly examined. It was at once apparent that extensive works were necessary, and a specification was accordingly prepared, and tenders invited for the execution of the work. The tender of Messrs. M. & M. Fleming, of Pall Mall Place, was accepted, and the contract satisfactorily carried out by them. The cost of the work, which comprised the cleaning of the external brick and stonework, and re-painting and re-decorating the interior throughout, as well as certain alterations to the offices, repairs to furniture, &c., amounted to £577. The furniture in the Vestry Hall, Committee Room, 36 &c., was re-polished, and new carpets provided by Messrs. Gregory & Co., of Regent Street, for a farther sum of £74 16s. 6d.; the gas fittings were repaired, re-lacquered, and re-bronzed, and the bell fittings put in order by Messrs. White & Son, of Oxford Street, at a cost of £29 6s. 3d., making a total expenditure of £681 2s. 9d. on the building. In addition to being used for ordinary parochial business, the Vestry Hall is utilised by the St. James's Savings' Bank, and for meetings of the St. Jameses Divisional Petty Sessions and Commissioners of Income-Tax, and occasionally for other purposes, such as Coroner's inquests, meetings of Parishioners on questions of public interest, &c. The building and furniture are insured in the Westminster Fire Office for the sum of £2,500, and the plate glass is insured with the National Provincial Plate Glass Insurance Company. The Stoneyard, Mortuary House, and Disinfecting Chamber have been maintained in satisfactory condition, the walls, office, store rooms, &c., of the Stoneyard having been re-painted and distempered, and the Disinfecting Chamber repaired during the year. Some of the painting and distempering was done by men in the service of the Vestry. The cost of the remainder of the work amounted to £35 7s. The bodies of 40 persons have been received in the Mortuary during the year, and the Disinfecting Chamber has been used on 29 occasions. The Vestry particularly desire that medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others, who may be brought into contact with the poor, as well as hotel-keepers, &c., should be aware of the provision thus made for the decent reception of bodies removed from overcrowded dwellings, or places where it is impossible or not convenient to retain the remains of the dead until burial. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfecting Chamber is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, the buildings may be used without charge. 37 SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. A staff of road sweepers, averaging about 24 in number, has been regularly employed by the Vestry, at a total cost for the year of £1,353 lis. 2d. The refuse collected by the sweepers is removed under contract, at a fixed sum, the contractor providing his own horses, carts, shoot, &c. House dust and refuse is also removed and the carriageways watered under the contract system. The whole of the work has been satisfactorily carried out during the past year, at a cost of £5,498 16s. 8^., particulars of which are given on page 104, Appendix B. The Vestry have exercised their option of terminating their contract with Mr. Mead, and have accepted the tender of Mr. H. Covington to remove the whole of the sloj^ dust, and other refuse from the Parish, for the sum of £3,200 per annum, being £800 per annum less than the contract just terminated. The terms of the street watering contract have also been revised, and the tender of Mr. Mead has been accepted. The total number of loads of street refuse reported to have been removed during the year was 10,339, as compared with 8,697 for the preceding twelve months. CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. In view of the expiration of the contracts for paviors' and masons' work, and the supply of materials at Lady-day, the Vestry have accepted the tender of Mr. H. Covington for the supply of hoggin and ballast, and of Messrs. John Mowlem & Co. fur paviors' and masons' work. Each contract is taken for a period of three years terminable at the end of the first or second year at the option of the Vestry. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1883, there were 753 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, 734 of which were ordinary street lamps (585 burning cannel gas, and 149 burning common gas), 4 were urinal lamps, and 15 were larger lamps attached to refuges. 38 On the 25th March, 1884, the number of lamps was 745, shewing a decrease of 8 in the twelve months; the proportion of different lamps now being 540 cannel gas street lamps, 186 common gas street lamps, 4 urinal lamps, and 15 refuge lamps. The whole of these lamps are lighted, extinguished, cleaned, and maintained by the Gas Company under an arrangement with the Vestry; the agreed sum being £2 13s. 10d. per annum for each ordinary street lamp, whether burning cannel or common gas, ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 3 ft. of common gas. As regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,473 5s. 6d., exclusive of new lamp-posts, lanterns, and fittings, which cost a further sum of £137 2s. 2d. The price of cannel gas for street lighting was reduced from' 3s. 11 d. to 3s. 6d., and of common gas from 3s. 2d. to 2s. 10d. per, 1,000 cubic feet on the 1st July last. A further reduction in the price of cannel gas to 3s. 4d., and of common gas to 2s. 8d. per 1,000 feet took effect on the 1st January. The following statement will perhaps show the extent of this reduction more clearly:— Consumption per hour. Cannel Gas @ 3/11 per 1,000 feet. Annual Charge per lamp. (Old Price.) Cannel Gas. @ 3/4 per 1,000 feet. Annual Charge per lamp. (Reduced Price.) Difference per lamp per annum. 2½ feet. 4 feet. 5 feet. £3 4 5 0 5 2 1 4 2 £2 3 4 13 15 9 10 4 8 6/3 less. 10/- less. 12/6 less. Common Gas. @ 3/2 per 1,000 feet. Common Gas. @ 2/8 per 1,000 feet. 3 feet. £3 0 1 2 13 10 6/3 less. The cost of street lighting shows a diminution of £102 16s. 5d for the year, as compared with the cost for the previous twelve months, the difference being entirely due to the above-mentioned reduction of price. Few alterations have been made in the street lamps during the year, although the subject of street lighting has been almost 39 tinuously before the Vestry. At the request of Admiral Close, the Vestry assented to his erecting an ornamental lamp in front of his residence, No. 4, Burlington Gardens, in lieu of a parish bracket lamp of ordinary pattern; a lamp-post has been erected at the corner of Silver Street and Great Pulteney Street, an additional lamp in Heddon Street, and the burner of a lamp at the north end of Berwick Street has been increased in size. The Vestry do not feel justified in making any considerable alteration in street lighting at the present time, in view of the probable introduction of the electric light at no very remote period. Upon the application of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Vestry gave their consent to small coloured glass tablets, indicating the position of fire plugs, being inserted in street lamps throughout the parish. PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps except upon the following conditions. 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside line of the kerb bounding the footway. 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Office, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no Lamps shall be suspended by ball and socket-joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps with their dimensions, and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. This important subject has again occupied much attention. With a view to retaining the supply of electricity for public and private purposes in their own hands, as far as possible, the Vestry 40 invited proposals from Electric Lighting Companies willing to work under a license. Several proposals were submitted in response to this invitation, but, probably owing to the short period (seven years) allowed under a license for recoupment to the undertakers, the terms proposed were not such as the Vestry felt justified in adopting, except in one instance. The only proposal entertained was that of the Electric Sun Lamp and Power Company, to whom was assigned a district bounded by a line running along the centre of the undermentioned streets: Oxford Street from the Circus to Poland Street, Poland Street, Broad Street to Cambridge Street, Cambridge Street to Beak Street, Beak Street and Regent Street northward to the Circus. Prolonged negotiations ensued upon the details of the proposed license being discussed and the matter still remains uncompleted. As stated in their report for last year, the Vestry had before them two applications for Provisional Orders, each order including the whole Parish in the area of supply. The Lighting Committee had interviews with representatives of each of the competingCompanies, and ultimately reported in favour of the application of the Edison Company, to the exclusion of the Metropolitan (Brush) Company. This report was adopted by the Vestry, and the Board of Trade were informed accordingly. Negotiations were continued with the Edison Company with a view to settle the terms of the Order in a friendly spirit, and the Company agreed to undertake to add a specified district to the compulsory area of supply within two years from the confirmation of the Order, in consideration of the Vestry supporting their application before the Board of Trade. It may be explained that, although the whole Parish is included in the area of supply, the obligations of the Company do not equally apply throughout the district. In the district described as "Schedule A" in the Order, which comprises all the Parish south of and including Piccadilly, the Company are required to lay down within two years from the commencement of the Order and thereafter maintain, suitable and sufficient distributing mains in certain streets specified in that behalf. Owners or occupiers of property in other streets in 41 "Schedule A," or the Local Authority having the control and management of the public street lamps, may require the Company to lay down distributing mains, but before acceding to a request by private consumers, the Company may demand a guaranteed income for three years equivalent to twenty per centum per annum upon the expense of providing and laying down the mains, or in the case of a requisition by the Local Authority, the Company must provide and lay the mains upon the Authority entering into an agreement to take electricity for the public lamps in the street in which the mains are to be laid for a period of three years at the least. In the district described as "Schedule B," the Company are under no obligations until it has been added to "Schedule A" by order or the Board of Trade, and are then only compelled (unless otherwise required by such Order), to lay mains on a similar requisition and guarantee as provided for in the case of other than specified streets in "Schedule A." If the Company refuse or fail to comply with the requirements of the Order or of a requisition made thereunder, they are liable to a pecuniary penalty or the revocation of the Order in whole or in part. To secure the carrying of the Order into effect so far as relates to the "specified streets," the Company are required to deposit or secure to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade, the sum of £20,000, to be released by the Board as the works proceed. Upon the application of the Vestry, who were represented by the Vestry Clerk, at a local enquiry before the Board of Trade,—the Chairman (Mr. Burgess) and one or two members of the Lighting Committee being also present,—the Board directed this sum to be held to be deposited rateably in respect of the parishes and district covered by the Order, according to the proportionate length of the streets specified in "Schedule A" to the Order. While the Draft Order of the Edison Company was still under consideration by the Board of Trade, an application was received from the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company for consent to apply for a license to supply electricity in a portion of the Parish, but as the arrangements with the Edison Company for supplying electricity throughout the Parish had already made much 42 progress, and, having regard to the late period of the Parliamentary Session, and also to the terms of a Memorandum issued by the Board of Trade to the effect that no monopoly was conferred or intended to be conferred by the granting of a Provisional Order, it appeared to the Vestry to be premature to introduce a competing element until they had gained some experience of the working of the Order. The application of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company was, therefore, not granted. The Board of Trade eventually settled the terms of the Provisional Order for the Edison Company, but as some opposition was threatened to the confirmation thereof by Parliament, the Company offered to lay and maintain distributing mains in Piccadilly as if the same was a specified street, on condition that the Vestry undertook to support, at the expense of the Company, the confirmation of the Order by Parliament. This offer was accepted, and an agreement was subsequently entered into to give effect thereto. When the Provisional Orders were before Parliament, the Metropolitan Board of Works presented petitions against them, without having previously ascertained the views of the Vestries or District Boards,who (and not the Metropolitan Board) are the Local Authorities under the Electric Lighting Act. It appeared probable that if this opposition were persevered in, the whole of the Orders would be lost, and the general introduction of electric lighting into the Metropolis retarded by at least a year. As the Vestry were disposed to favour the introduction of the electric light into the Parish, and had spent much time in obtaining modifications in the Edison Order, in the public interest, they at once memorialised the Metropolitan Board of Works to withdraw their opposition, and presented a counter petition in favour of the Order. Similar action was adopted by many other Vestries, and the Metropolitan Board withdrew their petitions. The whole of the Provisional Orders granted by the Board of Trade were referred by the House of Commons to a hybrid mittee. The Edison Company's Order was opposed by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, who desired to obtain a portion of the Parish for an area of supply ; by the Strand 43 District Board of Works, who were willing to assent to the Jablockhoff Company working under a license; and by others. Evidence for and against the Order was given at some length, and the following statements by Mr. (now Sir T. H.) Farrer, C.B., Secretary of the Board of Trade, bearing upon the question of monopoly, are of special and permanent interest and importance:— "As far as I can judge at present, there is no reason why the several wires of several undertakers should not be carried down the same street, so that supposing that the Company which is already in possession does not give the supply of electricity at the proper price there is'no physical reason, as far as I can see, why another Company should not be introduced to compete with it. In the opinion of the Board of Trade there is no legal reason why the Board of Trade should not give another license to another Company, the moment the first Company is proved not to be doing its duty satisfactorily. "The Committee [on the Electric Lighting Bill, 1882] carefully avoided inserting in the Bill any provisions for a revision of price. "They thought that those provisions for purchasing the undertaking at. the end of 21 years, and the fact that no monopoly was created, would be much better safeguards than any artificial revision of price, This is an important point, and I mentioned it because it is suggested in several of the Petitions. Now a revision of price has been tried in the case of gas, and it has been an eminent failure. I think, and it is quite obvious, that no Government Department is able to take a commercial undertaking of this kind, and investigate it, and say—' you can do such and such work at such and such a cost, and you ought not therefore to charge more than such and such a price.' The true way of settling price in this case, as in any other case, is competition, and competition is amply provided for in the Electric Lighting Act of last Session, and in our Orders, and in what we have done " 'With regard to the important questions of limitation of profits, revision of prices, and monopoly, the Board of Trade acting upon the principles of the Act of last Session, came to the conclusion expressed in the following paragraph of the Memorandum.' I wish to call particular attention to the fact that this Memorandum was circulated to all the Companies, so that everyone who has been concerned in these undertakings has had full notice of it. It is again printed in this Report, and no one can hereafter say that any monopoly has been granted to them, inconsistent with the conditions herein expressed. 'No clauses are inserted dealing with the above subjects,' that is, the limitation of profits, the revision of prices, and monopoly. ' In the 44 case of Companies, the undertaking can be purchased by the local authority, at furthest, at the end of 21 years, at the then value of the plant. In the meantime there is, in the first place, the competition with gas, which is likely to be very severe, and, in the second place, the potential competition with other undertakers to keep down the prices, as the Board of Trade see no reason whatever why such last mentioned competition should not be an active and potent force. The accounts of the undertakers are open to all. No monopoly is under the Act or the Provisional Order granted, or intended to be granted to them, and should they neglect their duties in the district, or charge exorbitant prices, there is nothing to prevent the immediate grant of a License or Provisional Order to a competing set of undertakers within the same district.' This paragraph is quoted at length, because there has been some misapprehension of the principles adopted, and because the Board wish it to be distinctly understood, both now and at all future times, under what conditions the present concessions are made, and thus to prevent any future claim to monopoly inconsistent with those conditions. 'In preparing the above conditions, the Board of Trade carefully considered the possibility of introducing clauses which might prevent the Companies to whom Orders are granted, from establishing any claims to exclusive rights within the districts comprised in their Orders. It was found, however, that no clause could be framed which would not have the effect of limiting the right of competition which exists without such a clause, and which it is the anxious desire of the Board of Trade to preserve. To assert that in certain events competition shall be allowed, is to exclude it in other cases, and any attempt to prevent the existing Companies from opposing new undertakings would be futile.' That meant to say that a clause was suggested by which the existing Companies were under certain circumstances to be precluded from appearing before the Board of Trade, or before Parliament to oppose any scheme; that was felt to be quite impracticable—Parliament would never have listened to it. 'The Board of Trade have therefore thought it more in the public interest to give the existing Companies ample notice that competition is not excluded, and that if they fail to do their duty to the public by supplying electricity on what, looking to the progress of the science, are for the time being reasonable terms, there is nothing in the concessions now made to prevent the introduction of new and competing undertakings, either by the local authorities or by other Companies. It must, however, be remembered that whilst on the one hand it is important to prevent the public from suffering the evils which have been felt in the case of the perpetual monopolies granted to Gas and Water Companies, it is, on the other hand, no less important to offer such inducements to solvent and prudent investors as may induce them to invest capital in this novel undertaking.' I think that is an extremely important 45 consideration."Question: "Would you consider any price within their maximum exhorbitant ?'—'Yes, for instance, if the price were twice as large as that charged by another Company in the adjoining district." "I say they are not discharging their duty, even if they are not charging their maximum price, if they are charging a much higher price than what other Companies similarly circumstanced are supplying other parties at." After an enquiry extending over many days, the Parliamentary Committee reported in favour of the Edison Company's Order, subject to the maximum price being reduced from 9d. to 8d. per unit. The Vestry do not attach much importance to the maximum price mentioned in the Order, as they conceive the Company will be compelled, in their own interests, to approach the price of gas as nearly as possible, and especially bearing in mind the important statements by the Secretary of the Board of Trade which are quoted above. The Order as amended passed the House of Commons, but when it came before the Lords renewed opposition was threatened by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, and the Edison Company, apparently fearing the loss of their Order, entered into negotiations with their opponents, with a view to arriving at a mutual understanding on the question of districts. The two companies eventually agreed that the opposition should be withdrawn, and that, subject to the consent of the Board of Trade, a portion of the area of supply comprised in the Order should be transferred to the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. The approval of the Local Authorities was subsequently sought to this arrangement, and the Vestry, seeing no objection to the same, expressed a general approval thereof. The Board of Trade, however, intimated that the proposed transfer should be effected by means of a Provisional Order, and the necessary notices were given and proceedings taken for obtaining an Order. On the draft Order being deposited the Vestry made certain suggestions for the amendment thereof, the most important being a reduction in the price to that offered by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company in the previous year, and the substitution of a minimum annual charge to small consumers for a 46 minimum quarterly charge, as the latter mode might enable the Company to charge a specified sum during the summer quarter although there had been absolutely no consumption of electricity during the period. The Board of Trade reduced the price by 1d. per unit (approximately equivalent to 10d. per 1,000 cubic feet of gas), but declined to alter the minimum charge as suggested. The Vestry have also received a draft Order for the Amalgamation of the Edison and Swan Companies and made representations thereon to the Board of Trade with a view to the protection of the interests of the consumers and parishioners generally, some of which have been adopted by the Board. The Vestry, and their Lighting Committee, have devoted an immense amount of labour to revising the form of the Provisional Orders under the Electric Lighting Act 1882, and are gratified to find that many of their suggestions to the Board of Trade are embodied in the Orders granted by the Board and confirmed by Parliament. It is probable that before the publication of another Annual Report, the electric lighting schemes will be in full operation so far as relates to the area comprised in Schedule A. No action has been taken on the resolution of the Vestry to apply for a license under the Electric Lighting Act. PROPOSED AMALGAMATION OF GAS COMPANIES. For some years past the Gas Light and Coke Company have steadily pursued a policy of amalgamation with the undertakings of other Companies, until the greater part of the Metropolis has been absorbed into their district. In some cases amalgamation has been attended with advantage to the consumer in the shape of reduction in the price of gas, consequent upon the economy resulting from the re-arragement of places for the manufacture and storage of gas, but the Vestry view with grave doubts any further amalgamation. It was therefore with some satisfaction that they received an intimation from the Board of Trade that, before assenting to the draft scheme for the amalgamation of the South Metropolitan Gas 47 Company with the Gas Light and Coke Company, it was the desire of the Board to receive the careful criticism of the various local authorities. Apart from the question of creating a powerful monopoly, which, in the absence of any corresponding public advantage, the Vestry consider would be objectionable, there seemed to be special reasons why the scheme under consideration should not be sanctioned. For instance, the Act of Parliament under which it was proposed to effect the amalgamation, requires any such scheme to provide for the re-arrangement of district and places for the manufacture and storage of gas, the inference being that the intention of Parliament was, that amalgamation should be effected only in cases where some public advantage might be expected to be derived therefrom. The Vestry, however, did not gather from the scheme that any re-arrangement of the places for the manufacture or storage of gas was contemplated, or that any other substantial advantage was to be anticipated in this particular case. But in addition to this negative objection to the scheme, there was foreshadowed a possible injustice to many of the gas consumers in the Metropolis. By the South Metropolitan Gas Company's Act of 1876 the "standard" price of gas is fixed in their district at 3s. 6d. per 1,000 cubic feet, while by the Gas Light and Coke Company's Act of the same year, the "standard" for their district is fixed at 3s. 9d. per 1,000 feet. If at any time the price of gas rises above the standard, the shareholders lose in dividend one-quarter per cent. for each penny of such increase, and on the other hand if the price is reduced below the standard, the shareholders are entitled to one-quarter per cent. additional dividend for every reduction of a penny in price. At the time the amalgamation was projected, the price of gas in South London was 2s. 10d per 1,000 feet as against 3s. 2d. in the district of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and as it would seem necessary to make one uniform charge throughout the whole area of the United Company if the amalgamation took place, the question naturally arose in what manner it was intended to deal with the existing discrepancy, not only in actual price, but, what was of far more 48 importance, the varying "standards" north and south of the Thames. The only clause of the scheme appearing to deal with this subject proposed to make the provisions of the Gas Light and Coke Company's Acts apply when they were in conflict with those of the other company, and one result of this might be to raise the standard price in the South Metropolitan Company's district without the authority of Parliament, from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 9d., the sum mentioned in the Act of the Gas Light and Coke Company. It may further be stated that the price of gas for public lighting throughout the Metropolis is fixed at the amount charged for the time being to private consumers in the district of the South Metropolitan Company, and local authorities have therefore a direct interest in preventing any raising of the standard price in that district. As the value of the residual products has much increased since the standard price was fixed by Parliament, and improved processes have lessened the cost of producing gas, the standard should be lowered instead of being increased if it is to be altered at all. The scheme also provided for a large increase of capital bearing preferential claims. On these grounds, principally, the Vestry objected to the scheme of amalgamation, and requested the Board of Trade to withhold their consent to the same. The vestry subsequently received a communication from the Board of Trade stating, that having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and to the almost unanimous opposition of the representatives of the consumers, the Board had decided not to give their approval to the scheme of amalgamation. In connection with this subject, it is scarcely too much to say that had the local authorities created by the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855 been in existence in the early days of Gas and Water legislation, the saving to consumers, by a careful watchfulness such as is now exercised over the powers sought by the companies at various times, would probably at a moderate estimate have amounted to hundreds of thousands of pounds. 49 LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. In accordance with the agreement entered into by the Vestry with the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues, application was made at the General Sessions for the County of Middlesex, held in September last, for an order authorising the closing of Queen's Head Court and part of Great Crown Court, under the provisions of the Highways Act, 5 & 6, William IV., cap. 50. The publication of the necessary notices and compliance with the other requirements of the Statute having been proved, and no objection being raised to the closing of the courts, an order was made as asked. With a view to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the persons who must be at least temporarily displaced, it has been arranged that the improvement shall proceed by degrees. A large part of the space West of Rupert Street has been cleared, and the remainder of the buildings now in the hands of the Commissioners will be demolished as the ground at present vacant is built Upon. The action taken by the Vestry with a view to the erection of artizans' dwellings on the whole, or part, of the vacant land is detailed on pages 68 and 69. NAMES OF STREETS. The Metropolitan Board of Works having enquired the views of the Vestry relative to a proposal to incorporate Silver Street and Beak Street under the latter name, with a view to obviate the inconvenience arising from frequent repetitions of the name of Silver Street in various parts of the Metropolis, the Vestry informed the Board that they considered the alteration would be advantageous. An Order was subsequently made by the Board, under the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, for re-naming the whole line of buildings, "Beak Street, W.," and re-numbering the several houses therein, 67 in number. This is the only Order of the kind affecting the parish made during the year. Since the year 1862 twenty-five streets have been re-named or houses therein re-numbered, twenty-one street names abolished, and 459 houses re-numbered. 50 STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An Order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. The annual charge for this work amounts to about £400. By an Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfaresare placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish boundary, viz.:— Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An arrangement has been made with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street, as regards cleansing and paving, the boundary line being somewhat irregular. Many years since, an understanding was arrived at with the Strand District Board of Works for the cleansing and maintenance of Wardour Street throughout its entire width to be apportioned between the Vestry and the Board, instead of each of these authorities following the Parish boundary along the centre of the street and cleansing and maintaining the portion of the street actually within their jurisdiction. Thus the Vestry took charge of the whole width of Wardour Street south of Little Pulteney Street, and the Board the remainder of the street. During the past year an application was made to the Vestry to substitute a quieter description of paving for that then existing in the carriageway of Wardour Street, and the Vestry thereupon suggested that the Strand Board should unite in repaving the whole street either with wood or asphalte. The Board, however, did not acquiesce in this proposal, and as paving 51 half the width of the street with a different material was out of the question, and the Vestry did not feel justified, in view of possible legal objections, in expending a large sum in paving works outside the boundaries of the Parish, without lawful authority, an application was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works to give legal effect to the existing understanding with regard to the maintenance of the street. Some objection was raised by the Strand Board to the line of division, and eventually an Order was made by the Metropolitan Board placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes named, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. During the year wood pavement has been laid in the carriageways of St. James's Street and St. James's Place, and asphalte in the carriageways of Beak Street, and Smith's Court. The wood paving works were carried out by Messrs. Mowlem and Co., the total area so paved being 4,073 yards, and the net cost £886 6s. 3d. (after allowing £607 10s. 3d. for the pitching stones removed). The asphalte was laid by the French Asphalte Company, the total area being 1,540 yards, and the net cost £665 7s. 0d. (allowing £149 4s. 0d. for the pitching stones removed). In each case tenders were invited by public advertisement. Several applications for the substitution of a quieter or cleaner description of paving for that at present laid were received, and the Vestry decided to lay down asphalte in the roadway of Poland Street, and wood in the roadway of Wardour Street. Tenders were accepted in March, and the work was commenced towards the close of the month, the French Asphalte Company and Messrs. Muldoon Brothers, respectively, being the contractors. The Vestry have under consideration the desirability of altering the description of pavement in the carriageways of Argyll Place and other thoroughfares. 52 Particulars of paving repairs carried out during the year will be found on pages 87 to 91. Although no new sewer works were undertaken, a large amount of time was occupied in cleansing and otherwise attending to existing sewers and drains. Details of this description of work will he found in the Reports of the Surveyor and the Medical Officer of Health, which follow the Vestry's Report. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. The Vestry of Tooting having informed the Vestry that they had requested the Metropolitan Board of Works to seek Parliamentary powers for more efficiently ventilating sewers by means of other than open gratings in the roadway, a resolution was passed endorsing the views of the Tooting Vestry, and the Metropolitan Board was informed accordingly. REFUGES. During the past year one refuge has been formed in St. James's Street by King Street. The following is a complete list of refuges in the Parish:— Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. „ „ by the Athenaeum Club. „ „ by St. James's Palace. „ „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly, by St. James's Street. „ by Burlington House. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly Circus (3 Refuges). Regent Street, by Oxford Circus. ” „ by Argyll Place. „ „ by Conduit Street. „ „ by Glasshouse Street. ” „ by Air Street. ” ” by the County Fire Office. ” ,, by Jermyn Street. ” ,, by Charles Street. ” ” by the Haymarket. St. James's Street, by King Street. ” „ by Pall Mall. Waterloo Place, between the Athenaeum and United Service Clubs. 53 CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways:— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation from such plan, as sanctioned, be made during the execution of the work, without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches, thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. ST. THOMAS'S CHURCH. The application by the Trustees of St. Thomas's Church (formerly Archbishop Tenison's Chapel), for permission to erect an addition to the church on land formerly constituting part of the public way in King Street, but enclosed with the consent of the Commissioners for Paving in the year 1841, came before the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 1st June, when the application was not granted. The Trustees have since paid the nominal rent agreed upon when the land was enclosed. GOLDEN SQUARE. In the month of November the Metropolitan Public Garden, Boulevard, and Playground Association informed the Vestry that it was contemplated to ask the Trustees of Golden Square to give up the garden in the centre of the square to the public, and enquired whether, supposing the Trustees assented to the proposal, the Vestry would assume charge of the garden under the provisions of the Metropolitan Open Spaces Act, 1881. The question was thereupon referred to a Committee for consideration; but the Vestry came to 54 no decision upon the subject, as in the meanwhile they were informed that the Trustees of the garden were not prepared to dedicate the same to the public. SANITARY. The details of sanitary work present such a similarity of feature from day to day that it is practically impossible to convey any accurate idea of the time occupied by the Vestry and their Sanitary Committee in this branch of their duty. It may, however, be remarked that not only is the Parish under continual inspection with a view to the discovery and removal of nuisances, but that, from time to time, printed instructions for dealing with matters affecting the public health, are circulated among the parishioners. For many years the sanitary condition of the Parish has been steadily but quietly improved by this action of the Vestry and their sanitary staff, and at no previous time was there less likelihood, humanly speaking, of the spread of epidemic disease. The maintenance of a satisfactory state of affairs may be materially aided by the intelligent co-operation of the parishioners, especially of such as, by their avocations, are brought into the poorer or more crowded districts, and the Vestry always gladly receive an intimation of cases requiring attention, and are quite willing to respect the confidence of their informants if desired to do so. Anonymous communications also receive attention, but, in these cases, enormous waste of valuable time frequently arises from the Vestry's Officers not being put in full possession of the facts, and being unable, from their ignorance as to the complaining party, to obtain necessary particulars. It is therefore desired that all communications should be authenticated by the name and address of the writer. Upon the request of the Vestry, the Guardians of the Westminster Union readily consented to direct their Relieving Officers to immediately communicate to the Sanitary Department any nuisance which they may observe in the course of their ordinary duty, as contemplated by the Nuisances Removal Act. A similar request was made to the Superintendent of Police, who stated, in reply, that the Commissioner had already issued such an order to the force 55 and that it would afford the police of the St. James's Division pleasure to act in harmony with the Vestry's Officers in the matter. Among other questions bearing on the public health that have received consideration during the year, is the enforcement of regulations with regard to tenement houses under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866. Regulations for this purpose were made in the year 1867, their operation being limited to one year. The degree of success attending these regulations at that time was not encouraging, and they were therefore not revived, the Vestry preferring to act under the general law relating to nuisances, which, in most cases, proved sufficient. At the close of the year, however, the Vestry were considering the advisability of framing fresh regulations. The Vestry have also had under consideration the various statutes relating to the dwellings of the labouring classes, and have suggested to the Local Government Board the desirability of transferring the inspection and sanitary regulation of common lodginghouses from the police to the local Sanitary Authority. Another Act which the Vestry consider requires early amendment, is the Labouring Classes Lodging-Houses Act, which enables local Authorities to appoint Commissioners to provide lodging-houses, but does not give them power to compulsorily purchase land or property for the purpose. The Vestry have also called the attention of the Local Government Board to this point. Licenses to the two slaughter-houses in the Parish have been renewed. There are no cowsheds at present existing in the Parish. Particulars of the sanitary condition of the Parish, and sanitary works carried out during the year, are given in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 127, and the Appendices thereto. INSPECTION OF CONVENTS AND SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS. In the month of April attention was directed to an outbreak of Typhus Fever in Nazareth House, Hammersmith, which only 56 became known to the local authority when the disease was assuming an epidemic form. At present the Sanitary Officers have no power to enter premises unless they have reasonable grounds for believing that a nuisance exists therein; and the Vestry considering that more extensive powers should be conferred on them in the case of large institutions, where, if entry were refused, it might be difficult to establish any such reasonable grounds, a resolution was passed to the effect that in their opinion all institutions receiving inmates should be under constant inspection by the Local Sanitary Authority. A copy of this resolution was forwarded to the Home Secretary, who acknowledged the receipt thereof. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES ACTS. The proposed amendment and partial repeal of these Acts was brought under the notice of the Vestry on the 24th May, and being of opinion that the operation of the Acts had been attended by much benefit in garrison and dockyard towns, from moral as well as other points of view, the Vestry passed a resolution asking the Members of Parliament for Westminster to support the retention of the clauses relating to compulsory examination, and inviting the co-operation of other Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis in the same direction. A resolution condemnatory of the Acts was, however, adopted by the House of Commons and the Government have withdrawn those members of the Metropolitan Police who had been specially detailed for duty in places where the Acts are in force; but there was no legislation on the subject during the year. METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. A letter was received from the Hampstead Vestry in the month of June objecting to any further expenditure of the ratepayers' money by the Asylums Board in continuing the much-contested litigation respecting the Hampstead Hospital. The Vestry, however, did not express any opinion on the subject, being unwilling to 57 hamper the Asylums Board in performing the very difficult task laid upon them by Parliament of providing hospital accommodation for the infectious sick throughout the Metropolis. Letters were also subsequently received from the City of London Union and the Guardians of the Holborn Union, condemnatory of the constitution and administration of the Board; but no action was taken in either case. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The arrangements made with the Guardians for the removal to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board of poor persons, above the class of paupers, suffering from infectious disorders have been continued. Patients desiring hospital treatment and in a position to pay for their maintenance are received at Highgate Small Pox Hospital and Islington Fever Hospital respectively. In the event of an outbreak of any such disease, information and assistance in the way of removal and disinfection may be readily obtained by Parishioners at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly. CHOLERA. In anticipation of the possible appearance of cholera, which happily was not realised, a handbill giving plain directions for maintaining houses in a sanitary condition was prepared by the Medical Officer of Health, and circulated throughout the Parish. As these directions are applicable for all time, a reprint thereof is appended:— Infectious diseases, especially Cholera, Diarrhoea, etc., are best prevented by precautions which may be summed up in one word—cleanliness. In the Parish of St. James the conditions are such that with reasonable care on the part of householders, there is little danger of Cholera, if imported, being able to effect a lodgment. Attention however, is called to the following simple precautions:— 1. Cleanliness in the drinking water is of the first importance. Water drawn from surface wells by ordinary hand-pumps should be avoided. Public pumps of this kind have long been done 58 away with in St. James's; and if any such pumps still exist in private houses they should be removed. The subsoil water in London is necessarily polluted by soakage from sewers, from the surface of the streets, etc., and such water is especially dangerous as the medium through which Cholera reaches healthy persons. The safety of the London drinking water may be ensured, in case of doubt, by boiling and filtering it. The cisterns in which drinking water is stored should be flushed out once a week—say every Saturday. The waste-pipe may be removed for a few minutes, when the water is about to come in, and the empty cistern rinsed out by allowing the fresh water to rush into it freely for a minute or two, and then run away. This may be repeated until the cistern is clean. The lead lining of the cistern should not be swept or scrubbed. The cistern should be kept carefully covered from dust, and so arranged that rats, mice, or other animals cannot fall into the water, and that children cannot play with the cistern. The waste-pipes should be carefully disconnected from water closets and drains, so that the water in the cistern be secured against pollution by sewer air entering the upper part of the cistern. 2. Cleanliness in the atmosphere of dwelling-houses is secured by such management of the drains as to ensure the free escape of all soil and refuse water, while at the same time the drains are so trapped as to prevent sewer air from coming back into the house. The chimneys suck out of the house a large quantity of air, and if an equal quantity of air be not allowed to enter the house by clean, healthy openings, such air will be sucked into the house through the drains and water closets, or will pass down such chimneys as are not heated by fires, and will thus defile the atmosphere of the house with soot. Much of the dirt and blacks in the atmosphere of town houses is brought into the house in this way. The best means of supplying the house with air is to have a fanlight always open in the basement, such fanlight being so arranged as to shoot the incoming current out of the way of the inmates who have to use the passages. 3. The management of the dust-bins. Kitchen refuse should be burnt. The dust-bin should be outside the basement of the house, and not near a door through which air enters the house. The dust-bin should be emptied every week Any defect in the water supply, cistern, closets, drains, or dust-bin, should at once be reported to the Sanitary Inspector at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly. 59 DISEASES PREVENTION (METROPOLIS) ACT, 1883. This Act, which received the Royal assent on the 20th August, contains important provisions for the isolation and treatment of persons suffering from cholera and other infectious diseases. The Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District are thereby created a local authority for certain purposes of the Diseases Prevention Act, 1855, and, as such, are authorised to contract with the managers of any hospital, infirmary, or workhouse, for the reception and treatment of cholera patients in any-such building. Vestries and District Boards are authorised to borrow money for providing hospital accommodation under the Sanitary Act, 1866 ; and part of the expenses of providing such accommodation, as well as a portion of the cost of administration, will be a charge on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. Another section of the Act admits the principle that the removal to hospital, and maintenance therein, of any person suffering from an infectious disease is not to be considered parochial relief, or involve any disability or disqualification. The Act, however, is a tentative measure only, and will expire on the 1st September, 1884. A circular letter was received from the Local Government Board early in September, setting forth the nature and scope of the regulations which the Board proposed to issue in the event of an outbreak of cholera in London. In addition to providing for the medical visitation of the poorer class of houses, the supply of medical attendance and nursing, and of medicines and disinfectants, as on former occasions, the regulations would further include the provision of such hospitals and places of refuge as may be necessary for local purposes. A new departure in sanitary legislation would thus be made in providing not only hospitals for the sick who could not receive proper attention in their own homes, but also "places of refuge" for the lodgment of persons who, although not actually sick, should be kept under observation, or of those temporarily displaced while their home was either under disinfection, or devoted to a sick person who could not properly be removed. The Vestry recognise the value of these additional means of preventing the 60 spread of infectious disease, and believe that an epidemic might thus be confined within very narrow limits, if the occurrence of the earliest cases were promptly brought under the notice of the local sanitary authority. INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. Reference was made in the Report of the Vestry for the year 1882-3, to the unsatisfactory state of the law regarding the sanitary inspection and regulation of bakehouses. This important question was brought under the notice of the Government, and resulted in legislation (the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883) which imposes special penalties on the occupier of any bakehouse allowing the same to be in an unsanitary condition, and enables a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to order the adoption of means for removing the ground of complaint. Under this Act the Vestry also have power to enforce certain sections of the Factories and Workshops Act, 1878, relating to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and sanitary arrangements of retail bakehouses. In the case of bakehouses brought into use after the 1st June, 1883, no water closet or ashpit is to be in, or communicate with, any such place; the cistern for supplying water to the bakehouse may not be connected with a water closet; and no opening from any drain or pipe conveying sewage matter is allowed within the bakehouse. It is anticipated that these requirements, without being unnecessarily irksome, will be found in practice sufficiently stringent to ensure the observance of decency and cleanliness in the manufacture of bread. WATER SUPPLY. In the month of August a letter was received from the Local Government Board, calling attention to a paragraph in the Report of Colonel Bolton, the Water Examiner appointed under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, for the previous month, suggesting that a supply of water on the constant system should be provided in the Golden Square District of the Parish. The Vestry learned with much satisfaction that the Grand Junction Water Works Company had almost simultaneously given public notice of their 61 intention to provide on and after the 1st January, 1884, a constant supply in so much of their district as lies to the east of Regent Street and north of Piccadilly and Coventry Street, consequently it was not necessary to take any action in the matter. The cleanliness of cisterns where the constant supply system does not prevail is of so much importance, and yet frequently receives so little attention from householders, that the following extract from a report by Colonel (now Sir F.) Bolton on the subject is not without interest:— Every exertion is made and means adopted by the Companies, after the water is taken in by them, to deliver it to their districts effectually filtered and of a wholesome quality. The water thus delivered for domestic purposes is frequently deteriorated after leaving the Companies' mains, by the dirty state of the receptacles on the premises of the consumers. 'All cisterns and other receptacles should be frequently cleaned out, and every care should be taken to prevent the contamination of the domestic supply after delivery The contamination of water from the gases generated by sewage is of far more frequent occurrence than is generally understood. Wastepipes from cisterns are still to be found in direct communication with the sewers, and the gases thus flow back into the cisterns and become absorbed by the water. To prevent this, the overflow pipe should be brought outside the house and the end left exposed to the air, instead of being carried into the drain, as is often the case. By the adoption of this plan the poisonous effluvia and gases from the drains will be got rid of ; these would otherwise ascend through the pipe, and not only be partly absorbed by the water in the cistern, but be mixed with the air in the houses, thereby becoming a cause of fever and disease. It may not be generally known that one of the regulations made under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, prohibits any overflow or waste pipe to a cistern, except as a warning pipe. The regulation runs as follows:— Regulation 14.—No overflow or waste-pipe other than a "warningpipe" shall be attached to any cistern supplied with water by the Company, and every such overflow or waste-pipe existing at the time when these regulations come into operation shall be removed, or at the option of the consumer shall be converted into an efficient " warning-pipe," within two calendar months next after the Company shall have given to the occupier of, or left at the premises in which such cistern is situate, a notice in writing requiring such alteration to be made. 62 WATER COMPANIES' CHARGES. Upon the invitation of the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, the Vestry appointed some of their members to unite with other Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards in some common action with a view to limiting the powers of rating now claimed by the various Water Companies supplying the Metropolis. A deputation introduced by the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., subsequently waited upon the Home Secretary, at his private room in the House of Commons on the subject. The views of the deputation were expressed by Mr. William Farrer, a member of the St. George's Vestry; and the Home Secretary in reply held out no hope of special legislation in the direction indicated by the deputation. The subject was thereupon further considered; and Mr. Smith was requested to move, early in the following session, for the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to enquire into the operation of the Water Assessment Act. Notice of a motion in these terms was given, and the Vestry requested Lord Algernon Percy to support the same, when it is before the House, which his lordship promptly and cordially promised to do. Although the Vestry are not directly concerned in the case of "Dobbs v. The Grand Junction Waterworks Company," it may be interesting to note that judgment in the appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal was given by the House of Lords on the 30th November, in favour of the view entertained by the appellant that the Company is not entitled to charge on a higher assessment than the net annual value (where the rent cannot be ascertained), thus practically adopting as the basis of the charge the rateable value settled under the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act. The ground of their Lordships' decision, as given by Lord Bramwell, is briefly that the "annual value" of a house is not represented by the amount of rent paid, but "the rent at which it would let free of all usual tenants' rates and taxes and deducting therefrom the probable average annual cost of the repairs, insurance, and other expenses, if any, necessary to maintain them in a state to command such rent," thus following the definition of 63 "annual value" contained in 6 and 7, William IV., cap. 96. On the 20th December, a resolution was unanimously adopted congratulating Mr. Dobbs on the result of his action, and on the 28th February, the sum of £20 was voted towards the expenses of any further steps that may be necessary to protect the interests of the consumers. Six members of the Vestry were appointed to join the central committee formed for presenting a testimonial to Mr. Dobbs, but at the request of Mr. Dobbs, this committee has constituted itself a league for the protection of water consumers. Another important decision of interest to water consumers has been given duriug the past year, in the case of "Barham v. The New River Company," in which it was held that the Company have no power to charge the ordinary rate upon the full assessment of the premises, if such assessment includes a garden or stables not requiring a domestic supply. The charges authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several companies supplying this Parish with water, are almost identical, and for the information of Parishioners the scale is appended as follows :— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent, per annum ; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent, per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum, where the annual value of the house exceeds £30 but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water closet, fixed bath, or high service, half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. ARTIZANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS. As the question of housing the poorer classes in the Metropolis und other large towns has engaged a considerable amount of v 64 attention, especially during the last few months, it may not be uninteresting to briefly note the more important provisions of existing legislation on the subject. The Acts may be grouped, for convenience, under two heads, being commonly known as Torrens's Acts, and Sir Richard Cross's Acts. The former apply to single tenements or blocks of not more than ten houses, and are administered by the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. Sir Richard Cross's Acts are administered by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and apply to any houses, courts, or alleys within a certain area, which are unfit for human habitation, or where diseases indicating a generally low condition of health among the population have been from time to time prevalent, and such prevalence may reasonably be attributed to the closeness, narrowness, and bad arrangement, or the bad condition of the streets and houses, or groups of houses, within such area, or to the want of light, air, ventilation,, or proper conveniences, or to any other sanitary defects, or to one or more of such causes, and when the existing evils cannot be effectually remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the rearrangement and reconstruction of the streets and houses within such area, or of some of such streets or houses. Under each of these groups of Acts the Medical Officer of Health is the originating authority. It is his duty, under Torrens's Acts, to report to the Vestry any premises (defined as meaning "any dwelling-house or inhabited building, and the site thereof, with the yard, garden, outhouses, and appurtenances belonging thereto, or usually enjoyed therewith") which are in a condition or state dangerous to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation. The Vestry are thereupon to refer the report to a surveyor or engineer for him to report the cause of the evil, and the remedy thereof, and whether the same can be remedied by structural alterations and improvements, or otherwise, or whether such premises, or any and what part thereof, ought to be demolished. Upon receiving a report from their surveyor or engineer, the Vestry are to send a copy thereof to the owner of the property, who may carry out the works suggested therein, or object to the same, 65 either on general grounds, or on the ground that the works ought to be carried out at the expense of some other person, or of the parish. If these objections are overruled, the Vestry may prepare a plan and specification, and estimate of the cost of the said works, and after hearing objections by the owner of the property against th same, may make any order for such works as they consider necessary to be carried out. This order, however, is subject to appeal. Any four or more householders may require the Medical Officer of Health to inspect any premises in or near the street in which they reside, by representing to him that the same are unfit for human habitation. If the Vestry declines or neglects to put the Act in force, the Secretary of State may compel the Vestry to proceed. If the requirements of the order involve the total demolition, and not the improvement, of the premises specified therein, the Vestry may take down and remove the buildings, upon the owner neglecting to do so, and sell the materials, paying the balance, if any, after deducting expenses, to the owner. In 1879 an amending Act was passed, by which the owner of condemned premises can compel the Vestry to purchase them, the amount of compensation to be paid for the same being settled either by agreement or arbitration. In making his award the arbitrator is to have regard to the nature and condition of the property, the probable duration of the buildings in their existing state, and state of repair thereof, not to include any additional allowance for compulsory purchase, and to take into account any increased value which, in his opinion, will be given to other premises belonging to the same owner, by the alteration or demolition of the condemned premises. The land acquired by the Vestry under these Acts may be sold or let, or dedicated as a highway or to some other public purpose. If the Vestry neglect or refuse to enforce the Act, on a notice from the Metropolitan Board of Works requiring them to do so, the c 66 Board may proceed instead of the Vestry, and charge the latter with the expenses incurred thereby. Property acquired under this Act is to be devoted by the Vestry or their lessees, either (1) to providing the labouring class with suitable dwellings by the construction of new buildings, or repairing or improving existing buildings; or (2) to opening out closed or partially closed alleys or courts inhabited by the labouring classes, and the widening of the same by pulling down any building, or otherwise leaving such open spaces as may be necessary to make such alleys or courts healthful. A lessee acquiring property under this Act is to forfeit his lease, if the works required by the Vestry to be carried out are either not commenced or not completed within the stipulated time. The expenses incurred by the Vestry in carrying the Act into execution are to be defrayed out of the general rate, which may be increased for the purpose to an extent not exceeding 2d. in the pound for any year. The Vestry is also empowered to borrow money for the purposes of the Act. Sir Richard Cross's Acts mainly relate to the Metropolitan Board of Works, but incidentally they amend Torrens's Acts in the following respects. An unhealthy area comprising a block of not more than ten houses, is to be dealt with by the Vestry under Torrens's Acts. Any building not in itself unfit for human habitation, may be dealt with by the Vestry, if it is an "obstructive" building, that is, if by reason of its proximity to, or contact with, any other buildings, it either (1) stops ventilation, or otherwise makes, or conduces to make, such other buildings to be in a condition unfit for human habitation, or (2) prevents proper measures from being carried into effect for remedying the evils complained of in respect of such other buildings. Where, in the opinion of the arbitrator, the demolition of an obstructive building adds to the value of such other buildings, he may apportion so much of the compensation to be paid for the 67 demolition, as may be equal to the increase in the value of the other buildings, among such other buildings, and the Vestry may assess the occupiers thereof to a special improvement rate for the purpose of levying the amount so apportioned. If the Vestry do not proceed on the report of the Medical Officer of Health, the Guardians of the Parish or Union in which the property is situate, or any owner of property in the neighbourhood, may complain to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who are thereupon empowered to do what they consider the Yestry should have done, and charge the expenses incurred thereby to the Vestry in default. The other provisions of Sir Richard Cross's Acts (the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Acts, 1875 to 1882) do not directly affect the Vestry, as the Metropolitan Board of Works are the Local Authority in the Metropolis for carrying the Acts into execution. But these Acts have an important bearing on the subject of housing the poor, and an outline of their principal provisions is therefore given. As already remarked, these Acts apply to unhealthy areas, and not to individual dwellings or blocks of ten or a less number of houses. The Medical Officer of Health is to report any such area to the Board, either upon his own responsibility, or at the instance of two or more Justices of the Peace, or twelve or more ratepayers. The Board may thereupon prepare an improvement scheme for the area so reported, or a portion thereof, and the scheme is to provide for the accommodation in suitable dwellings in the same area or the vicinity thereof for such proportion, not being less than half of the number of persons of the working class displaced, as the confirming authority (the Home Secretary) may sanction or direct. The scheme, when approved by the Home Secretary, is to be embodied in a provisional order and submitted to Parliament for confirmation. If twelve or more ratepayers complain to the Medical Officer of Health of the unhealthiness of any area, and the Medical Officer 68 fails to report such area, or represents that in his opinion the area is not unhealthy, the complainants may appeal to the Home Secretary, who shall, on security being given for the costs, order an inquiry to be made. The expenses of the Local Authority, after allowing for the sale of the property acquired, is to be defrayed from the rates, and the Local Authority may borrow money on the security of the rates to defray expenses under the Act. By the Act of 1879, the amount to be paid in compensation is limited to the value of the premises after deducting any expenditure that might be chargeable to abate a nuisance, if the premises are in such a condition as to be a nuisance within the meaning of the Acts relating to nuisances. It will be seen from the foregoing epitome that extensive powers already exist for dealing with dilapidated houses and unhealthy areas, but the enormous cost of carrying the Acts into execution, and the length of time required for the various proceedings, have seriously restricted their operation. In all large towns, moreover, there will always be found a number of houses not sufficiently bad to be condemned as unfit for human habitation, and yet scarcely meeting modern requirements for dwellings. Such cases receive constant attention from the Sanitary Officers, but the remedies obtainable under the Nuisances Removal Acts are usually but temporary. A more summary mode of dealing with defective houses would no doubt be advantageous, but probably no remedy will be really effectual which does not recognise the necessity of raising the moral standard of the people, while also providing them with the means of living decently. The Sanitary Committee have devoted a considerable amount of time to the consideration of the subject, and inspected the most crowded district of the Parish. They have also requested the Medical Officer of Health to at once report any case coming under his notice, which may be dealt with under these Acts. A large number of the poorer working class have been displaced by the improvement now being carried out in Little Pulteney 69 Street and Rupert Street (extension) by arrangement with the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues, the freeholders of the property; and it appeared to the Vestry that a large portion, if not the whole of the site cleared for the improvement, might be utilised to the greatest advantage by the erection of artizans' dwellings thereon, either in separate blocks or over business premises. Representations were accordingly made to the Commissioners of the importance of providing this class of accommodation for the benefit of those who are employed in working for west-end houses, and by the nature of their employment are compelled to reside within easy reach of their work. It is clear that if provision is not made for this class overcrowding must result, and the Vestry therefore received with much pleasure an assurance from the Commissioners that the importance of the subject had not been overlooked, and that although the question is surrounded by difficulty, arrangements were in progress which it was hoped would meet the requirements of the locality in the manner indicated. The Vestry will continue to give careful consideration to the utilisation of this site. Closely allied to the question of artizans' dwellings are those of overcrowding and underground dwellings. Both these matters have received constant attention during the year, and have formed the subject of many notices issued by the Sanitary Officers, and in one or two cases of legal proceedings. While it is desirable to prevent, as far as possible, individual instances of hardship in the case of large families supported on small means, the fact must not be overlooked that the interests of the community at large and of the younger members of such families in particular demand an efficient remedy against overcrowding, and the occupation of unsuitable dwellings. But it is more difficult to find and apply a remedy which shall be universally applicable, than to realise the unsatisfactory state of affairs which now too often exists. At present the law permits a cellar (otherwise prohibited) to be occupied as a dwelling, if it is not "separately" so occupied; but even if the occupation of such a room were prohibited under any 70 stances, infringements of the law could, in many cases, only be discovered by inspecting sleeping apartments at night, a course which is open to obvious objection. Common lodging-houses are required to be registered, and are under police supervision; there are seven of these establishments in St. James's, affording in all accommodation for 78 lodgers, the smallest being certified for three beds, and the largest for 19 beds. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. Seventy-six articles of food, drink, and drugs have been examined by the Public Analyst during the past year. Of these 14 were certified to be admixed with foreign ingredients, or to have a portion of their natural quality abstracted and proceedings were instituted in 11 cases. Convictions were obtained, and fines inflicted in 10 cases; the other summons was dismissed on a technical objection, which was characterised by the Magistrate as a quibble. The following is a list of the articles analysed:- Coffee Cream Milk Mustard Pepper 18 1 49 7 1 76 The cost incurred by the Yestry for the year, in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, is as follows :— Allowance to Analyst Purchase of samples, &c. £ 75 1 Fines recovered s. d. 0 0 5 3i Net cost to the Parish £61 0 £76 5 hn 1 co 15 5 0 £61 0 H 71 SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out for the following offences:— Adulteration 11 Unsanitary condition of premises 9 Letting or occupying cellar dwellings 2 Obstructions 3 Erecting hoard without license 3 Non-payment of cost of re-instating pavement, &c. 3 Total 31 In all these cases with two exceptions (one, a summons for selling milk admixed with water, and the other for recovery of a paving account), the necessary works were carried out, fines inflicted, or the claim satisfied. As regards the summons for the paving account, the vestry were not in possession of direct evidence connecting the defendant with the disturbance of the pavement, the cost of reinstating which it was sought to recover, and the summons was dismissed. The magistrate, however, refused to allow costs to the defendant, and offered to grant a fresh summons if further evidence were forthcoming. The result of summonses under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts is mentioned on page 70. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Several complaints were received of houses alleged to be used for immoral purposes, and enquiries were instituted with a view to proceedings in all cases where the complaint was substantiated by two householders. In three instances the houses were cleared of the objectionable characters by the owners upon the representations of the Vestry, and in three other cases, formal notices of prosecution were served on the occupiers. Legal proceedings were, however, rendered unnecessary in the last mentioned cases by the occupiers vacating the premises within a few days after service of the notices. 72 SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. The constantly increasing expenditure of this Board continues to excite attention from the Rating Authorities, who are responsible for meeting its demands upon the ratepayers. A conference of representatives from Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards was convened by the Vestry of St. Pancras early in the year, and Mr. Bonthron and Mr. Winnett were requested to attend the same, as representing the Vestry of St. James's. A statement of the views of the conference was drawn up in the form of a memorial and presented to the Rt. Hon. A. J. Mundella, Vice-President of the Council, by a deputation. The memorial set forth that while cordially acknowledging the labours of the School Board and being anxious that elementary education should be fostered in every way consistent with sound and judicious economy, the delegates assembled in conference, viewed with alarm and dissatisfaction the increasing burden cast on the rates by the action of the Board. Among other remedies, the delegates suggested that the supplanting of voluntary schools should cease, that the school fees should be revised in such a manner as to afford the very poorest the "benefits of education while excluding the children of the better-to-do classes, who are at present attracted by superior education and low fees, that excessive salaries to teachers should be reduced, that better scrutiny and improved organization might effect considerable reduction in other heavy items of expenditure, and that the whole financial system of the Board should be reviewed. The deputation was courteously received by Mr. Mundella, who promised to bring at least some of the points raised in the memorial under the notice of the Board. It remains, however, to be seen with what result. In the month of November a communication was received from the Holborn District Board of Works, and some other local authorities, protesting against the proposed expenditure of £53,000 for alteration and repairs to the offices of the School Board, and a URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals erected and maintained by the Vestry :— Situation. No of Compartments. Situation. No. of Compartments. Blenheim Street 4 King's Arms Yard 3 Broad Street 8 Mason's Yard 3 Coach and Horses Yard 4 Vine Street 7 Cork Mews 2 Wells Street 5 Ham Yard 3 With a view to remedying several complaints of nuisances being committed in Heddon Street, the Vestry caused plans to be prepared for the erection of an ornamental public urinal in 73 resolution was passed thereon expressing concurrence with this protest; subsequently, upon the invitation of the Plumstead District Board of Works, the Vestry appointed three delegates to attend a conference of Metropolitan Local Authorities, to enquire into the causes of continuous increase in the amount of the School Board's precepts. At this conference a further memorial to the Education Department was prepared, pointing out certain respects in which the expenditure of the Board might be curtailed without impeding the important work of popular elementary education. The Vestry have contributed £10 towards the expenses of the Association which has been formed for limiting the expenditure of the School Board. In connection with this subject, it may be interesting to note that the School Board require payment of no less than £127,648 from the various rating authorities of Westminster for the year 1884-5, while there are but seven Board schools in the whole division, affording accommodation for 4,191 children, with an average attendance of 3,681; the amount of the precepts being at the rate of £34 13s. 6d. per head for every child in average attendance. A statement of the amount called for by the Board annually during the past ten years, is given on page 35. 74 that street. In deference, however, to the opposition offered by residents in the locality, the Vestry did not proceed further in the matter, although they still incline to the opinion that a well-kept urinal would prove less objectionable to the neighbourhood than the promiscuous committing of nuisances as at present. Two convictions have been obtained during the year for posting objectionable bills in public urinals in the Parish. The cost of maintaining the urinals during the year is as follows:— £ s. d. Water for flushing 129 7 9 Wages for cleansing 62 8 0 Painting, etc., Urinals 65 5 6 £257 1 3 CAB BANKS. The following is a list of the Cab Ranks in this Parish authorised by the Commissioner of Police :— No. of places. Broad Street ... ... ... .. 12 Hay market, Two Standings ... ... ... ... 32 Piccadilly ... ... ... .. ... ... 11 Regent Street ... ... ... ... 3 St. James's Square ... ... .. 10 St. James's Street ... ... ... ... .. 15 Waterloo Place ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 With the assent of the Vestry, the Commissioner of Police has fixed a water-post at the cab rank in St. James's Square. CABMEN'S SHELTERS. The Vestry willingly assented, in the year 1882, to an application by Miss Jackson, daughter of the Bishop of London, for permission to place a Cabmen's Shelter in St. James's Square. The shelter has since been provided, and will be maintained at private expense. 75 PILLAR LETTER BOXES. With the assent of the Vestry, pillar letter boxes have been erected by the Postmaster-General in the undermentioned thoroughfares:— Western District. Albany. Burlington Gardens. Coventry Street. Golden Square. Great Marlborough Street. New Burlington Street. Piccadilly, by the Egyptian Hall, Regent Street, by Piccadilly Circus. Regent Street, Quadrant. Sackville Street. Silver Street. South-Western District. Haymarket, by Jermyn Street. Jerrnyn Street, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by the War Office. Pall Mall, by Waterloo Place. St. James's Square, by Charles Street. A pillarbox in Cleveland Row was removed and the position of one at Piccadilly Circus was altered, but no new pillar box was erected during the year. FIXED POINTS. The following list of fixed points where a constable may be found at all times, is given for the information of parishioners:— Marlborough House, Pall Mall. Oxford Circus. Piccadilly. Regent Street, by Beak Street. FIRE BRIGADE. There is only one Fire Brigade Station in the Parish, viz., at 29, King Street, Regent Street (near Argyll Place), but other stations in adjoining parishes are available in case of an outbreak of fire. The stations nearest this Parish are situate at No. 171, 76 Great Portland Street, Oxford Street; 33, King Street, Portman Square; George Yard, Crown Street, Soho; and 44, Cliandos Street, Covent Garden. Fire Alarms in telegraphic communication with Fire Brigade Stations, have been erected by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the undermentioned thoroughfares:— Golden Square. Piccadilly, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by Marlborough House. Fire Escapes with attendants are nightly stationed in Golden Square and next the Parish Church, Piccadilly. MUSIC AND DANCING LICENSES. In accordance with the Standing Orders of the Court of Quarter Sessions, notices were given to the Vestry in the mouth of August, by intending applicants for Music and Dancing Licenses, as follows:— Bignell, Robert Richard, The Trocadero, 7 and 8, Great Windmill Street, for Music only. Hughes, John Strype, The Stanley Arms Coffee Tavern, 183, Wardour Street, for Music only. Leslie, George, St. James's Hall, [Piccadilly and Regent Street, for Music and Dancing. Mitchell, William Stair, The Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, for Music only. Phillips, Henry Frederick, The Piccadilly Art Galleries, for Music and Dancing. Spiers, Felix William, The Criterion, 221, Piccadilly, for Music and Dancing. Swallow, Benjamin Henry, The Goat and Star, 6, Swallow Street, for Music only. Villiers, Robert Edwin, The London Pavilion Music Hall, Tichborne Street, for Music only. Willis, Frederick Wilson, and Willis, Edward Avery, Willis's Rooms, 26, King Street, for Music and Dancing. The notice of Mr. Hughes was not proceeded with, and a license was granted by the Court of Quarter Sessions, in each of the other cases, as applied for. 77 PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES.—SESSION 1884. The Schemes affecting this Parish were three in number, and comprised the Mid-London Electric Railway, the Central London Electric Railway, and an application by the Metropolitan Board of Works for an extension of time for the purchase of property required for the new street from Piccadily Circus to Oxford Street, authorized by the Board's Act of 1877. A similar scheme to that of the Mid-London Railway has been opposed by the Vestry on several previous occasions, and the Vestry saw no reason to regard the present proposal more favourably. The proposal was to form a railway under the centre of Oxford Street, with a station in this parish at Nag's Head Yarc; and in view of obvious objections the Vestry dissented strongly from the scheme. Active opposition was rendered unnecessary by the abandonment of the project before the Bill reached the Parliamentary stage. By the London Central Electric Railway scheme it is proposed to form a direct communication from Piccadilly Circus to the City with a connection to the Electric Railway from Waterloo Station already authorised by Parliament. The proposed railway would, to a large extent, follow the line of the new street about to be formed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and as the construction of the railway and the formation of the street might proceed at the same time, no material disturbance to the business of th6 locality would be occasioned, while the cost to the ratepayers of the new street might be materially reduced, as the Company require for their own purposes much of the property acquired by the Board for the new street. The Vestry, considering the advantages to be derived, and the comparatively slight inconvenience which would be caused by the construction of the railway, approved the scheme, on condition that the position, plans, and elevation for the station near the Circus are subject to their sanction. The third Bill is being promoted by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the portion directly affecting this Parish is a proposal to extend, until August 1886, the time for the compulsory purchase 78 of lands required for the new street, authorized by Parliament in 1877, from Piccadilly Circus to New Oxford Street. The Vestry have informed the Board that they strongly object to any further delay in carrying out the improvement, inasmuch as by the Board having acquired property, and not utilised the same, the Parish has already sustained a heavy loss in rates; many families of the poorer classes have been displaced without other accommodation having been provided for them; the trade of the locality has severely suffered in consequence, and the Board have effected improvements which were not even contemplated when the Act was passed for the formation of this street. Another private Bill is being promoted by the Edison and Swan United Electric Light Company for the amalgamation of the two Companies, and the transfer to the United Company of the Electric Lighting Orders granted to each Company last Session. The same object is being sought by a Provisional Order (see page 46), and the Bill will probably not be proceeded with. RAILWAY VENTILATORS ON THE THAMES EMBANKMENT. On the 12th April, 1883, the Vestry passed a resolution concurring with the Board of Works for the Strand District, in remonstrating against the alienation of land dedicated by Parliament to public use. The Metropolitan Board of Works sought for powers from Parliament in the Session of 1883, to remove all the Ventilators constructed by the Metropolitan District Railway Company in the public streets and on the Thames Embankment, but were only partially successful. The Board are endeavouring this Session to obtain power to remove the remainder of the ventilators. THAMES COMMUNICATIONS. The subject of forming additional means of communication between the north and south sides of the river east of London Bridge, has been before the Vestry on one or two occasions, but as the local authorities of the districts most closely concerned appear 79 to differ in regard to the best mode of dealing with the question, and the Treasury demur to an extension of the period for levying the Coal and Wine Dues for the purposes of Metropolitan Improvements, the Vestry have not expressed any definite opinion in favour of any particular scheme which has been submitted for consideration. The Vestry are of opinion that further means of communication should be provided, but they do not regard the proposed tunnel at Nightingale Lane as a satisfactory solution of the question. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. Among the Bills that have received attention during the year are the following:— Session 1883. Bankruptcy. Criminal Law Amendment. Detention in Hospitals. Diseases Prevention (Metropolis). Factory and Workshop (1878) Amendment. Factories and Workshops Amendment. Free Libraries. Infectious Diseases Notification. Parish Churches. Police. Public Health (Dairies, &c.) Public Health Acts Amendment. Steam Boilers (Persons in charge). Session 1884. Companies Acts Consolidation. Dwelling-Houses' Inspection. Free Libraries. Hammersmith and Fulham Recreation Ground. Inhabited House Duty. London Open Spaces Preservation. Metropolis Water. Metropolitan Board of Works (Fire Brigade Expenses). Metropolitan Board of Works (Further Powers). Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings). Metropolitan Railway (Park Railway and Parliament Street Improvement). Mortmain Law Amendment. Summary Jurisdiction (Repeal, &c.) United Telephone Company. Valuation (Metropolis) Amendment. 80 It will be remembered that the Bankruptcy Bill, as introduced, proposed to repeal existing legislation, which provided for the preferential payment of parochial rates. The Vestry brought the matter under the notice of the Government with a view to the Bill being amended so as to continue this provision. The Government, however, did not take any action in the matter, and the Vestry therefore embodied their views in a petition which was presented to the House of Commons by the Right Hon. W. H. Smith. The Bill was referred to a Standing Committee, and Lord Algernon Percy, one of the Members for Westminster, placed on the Paper a notice of an amendment, with the object of continuing the preferential payment of rates, which was eventually agreed to by the Government, and passed into law. The Vestry have to acknowledge the courtesy with which Lord Percy received their representations in this matter. A similar question has arisen this session upon the Companies Acts Consolidation Bill, and the Vestry, failing to see any reason why a liquidating company should stand on a different footing to an insolvent individual or firm, have asked his lordship to move a like amendment to this Bill. With respect to the Infectious Diseases Notification Bill, which was introduced by a private member, the Right Hon. Sir Charles Dilke, President of the Local Government Board, stated that the Government agreed in the desirability of cases of infectious disease being at once notified to the local sanitary authority, but they were not prepared to support the Bill unless its scope was limited to affording facilities to the application of its provisions by local authorities, instead of making such notification universally compulsory. The Vestry entirely concurred in these views, and therefore did not deem it necessary to take any action in the matter. Petitions were presented by the Vestry as follows: In favour—of the Steam Boilers (persons in charge) Bill, providing for steam boilers being placed in charge of certified qualified persons only. This Bill, however, did not pass. 81 For alterations—in the Public Health (Dairies, &c.) Bill, so as to provide for the inspection and regulation of Dairies, etc., being placed under the local sanitary authorities instead of the Metropolitan Board of Works, as proposed, but the latter to make regulations for the whole Metropolis, to ensure uniformity. In the Factories and Workshops' Amendment Bill, for the omission of a clause prohibiting the erection of a bakehouse unless one half of its height was above the level of the street, or ground adjoining, and in support of a clause conferring powers of inspection, etc., on the local sanitary authority; and in the Metropolitan Board of Works (Fire Brigade Expenses) with a view to the Fire Brigade Rate being limited to one penny in the pound. Against—the United Telephone Company's Bill, which is referred to at greater length in a subsequent paragraph. The Public Health (Dairies, &c.) Bill did not pass, and the clause relating to underground bakehouses was omitted from the Factories and Workshops Amendment Bill; further particulars of the Factories and Workshops Amendment Act are given on page 60. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Fire Brigade Expenses) Bill is still before Parliament. As regards other Bills introduced into Parliament during the present session, the Vestry have expressed a general approval of the Metropolitan Railway (Park Railway and Parliament Street Improvement) and the Metropolis Water Bills; and dissent from the Hammersmith and Falham Recreation Ground, the Metropolitan Board of Works (Thames Crossings), so far as relates to a proposed tunnel at Nightingale Lane, and the United Telephone Company's Bills. The last-mentioned Bill has especially engaged attention. Its main provisions are to authorize the United Telephone Company to lay or suspend wires in or over streets subject to certain restrictions. The introduction of the Bill appeared to the Vestry to afford a favourable opportunity for general legislation on the subject, it being manifestly objectionable that so large a question 82 should be dealt with piecemeal in a Private Bill. The Yestry therefore communicated with the Home Secretary, the Local Government Board, and the Board of Trade, suggesting that the precedent set by the Government with respect to the Electric Lighting Bills in 1882 should be followed in the present instance, and that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee, with a view to the framing of a Public Bill of general application. The Vestry at the same time submitted a number of amendments which they considered should be embodied in the Bill, if the Government did not see their way to take up the whole subject, and invited other Local Authorities throughout the Metropolis to cooperate in the endeavour to obtain satisfactory legislation with regard to telegraph and other wires laid or suspended in streets. The Government have intimated their intention of opposing the Bill, but have not yet expressed any decision upon the suggestion that they should introduce a General Public Bill on the subject. The matter is one of growing importance, and the Yestry trust that either they, or some other constituted authority, will have power to control the laying and suspension of wires in streets,, before any appalling loss of life, through the falling of wires, calls public attention to the crying need of legislation. The action taken by the Yestry on the general question of overhead wires is noticed on page 83. The object of the Metropolis Water Bill, which was promoted by the Corporation of the City of London, was to bring the eight Water Companies supplying the Metropolis under control in the following respects:—(1) To compel the Water Companies to supply water by meter to any consumer requiring the same, the meter not to come into operation until 6,000 gallons have been supplied to the premises during the quarter; (2) to charge consumers not desiring a meter upon the rateable value of the premises; (3) to apply the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, to all the Water Companies, so that the dividend shall be limited to 10 per cent., and payments on account of back dividends to six years; (4) to require Companies to bring rents of property into their 83 dividend account; and (5) to require additional capital to be put up to auction. The Bill was, however, thrown out on the second reading. The Yestry do not object to the principle of the Valuation (Metropolis) Amendment Bill, which is to extend the right of appeal to lessees in certain cases, but joined with other Local Authorities in calling attention to the desirability of a clause being inserted to restrict the service of notice in such cases to the premises assessed. This amendment was accepted by the Members in charge of the Bill. PROPOSED ALTERATIONS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. The Government having again intimated their intention to introduce a Bill for creating a municipality for the whole Metropolis, the Vestry have appointed three of their members to attend a conference of representatives from the various local bodies of London, convened by the Vestry of St. Marylebone to consider the action to be taken upon the introduction of the Bill. The Vestry entertain the view that while for certain purposes the Metropolis may advantageously be governed as a whole, as in fact it is at present in the matter of the Fire Brigade, Main Drainage, &c., elected local councils for the administration of local affairs should form a distinctive feature in any scheme that may be formulated for altering the present mode of Local Government in the Metropolis. OVERHEAD WIRES. The rapid development of telegraphic and telephonic communication and consequent increase of wires stretched across and along the public streets in the Metropolis, led the Vestry to take into serious consideration their powers to prohibit and regulate such wires. From replies by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to questions in the House of Commons it appeared that the 84 ment entertain the opinion that the road authority is responsible for the manner in which these wires are stretched across public thoroughfares, although it is not at all clear upon what this opinion is based. The Telegraph Acts do not apply to any wires except such as belong to, or may be laid by, the Postal Telegraph Department, and it is therefore assumed that the powers (if any), possessed by the Vestry in regard to overhead wires are derived from the vesting of streets in the local authority. Having learned that the Vestries of the neighbouring parishes of St. Marylebone and St. George, Hanover Square had appointed a Joint Committee to consider the subject, the Vestry of St. James requested to be allowed to join in their deliberations, and appointed three members to represent them upon the committee. The Joint Committee of the three Vestries, believing that existing legislation does not give local authorities power to regulate the fixing of overhead wires, even supposing the authorities have power to remove the wires altogether (which is doubtful), recommended the appointment of a deputation from the City Commissioners of Sewers and all the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, to wait upon the Home Secretary and request him, on the part of the Government, to initiate legislation, conferring on local authorities the necessary powers of inspecting and regulating the erection of overhead wires. This recommendation was adopted and the co-operation of other Metropolitan authorities was accordingly sought, and very generally given. Some delay arose in the appointment of a day, by the Home Secretary, for an interview with the deputation, and eventually Sir Charles Dilke, President of the Local Government Board, received the deputation on behalf of the Home Secretary, on the 25th June. The deputation was introduced by Daniel Grant, Esq., M.P.; and Sir Arthur Hobhouse, a member of the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, stated the views of the Vestries on the subject; Mr. Endean, of St. Marylebone, Mr. Shaw, chairman of the City Commissioners of Sewers, and others, also speaking. Sir Charles Dilke, in reply, said (according to the report of the interview which appeared in The Times of June 27th), that the 85 view which the Government took of the matter was, that the owners of these wires, having no greater rights of interfering with streets than had any ordinary member of the public, could not either with or without the assent of the local authorities interfere with public highways in such a way as to cause obstruction to the public, even though such obstruction were limited to the time during which they were executing their works. He did not know that the Government were prepared to say that it would in all cases be unlawful to carry wires over houses with the consent of their owners, but it would be a question of fact in such a case whether wires so suspended were such a probable source of damage or danger to people going along the highway as would constitute a nuisance; and that, of course, would depend upon a variety of considerations connected with each particular case. The question in the matter was whether, in view of the great risks attending these wires, there was power in the local authorities to interfere, and if there were no such power, he agreed with the deputation that control should be vested in them. But the Government thought the authorities had this power, and until it was proved that they had not, he would not care to undertake legislation in face of the opposition with which such a scheme would be met. A meeting of the Joint Committee was shortly afterwards convened to consider the course to be adopted in view of this statement by Sir Charles Dilke; but the Yestry of St. George, Hanover Square, having thereupon decided to repudiate any liability in the matter, and to take no action, their members did not attend the meeting. The representatives of the Vestries of St. Marylebone and St. James, however, further discussed the question and agreed upon a report, suggesting that steps should be taken to ascertain the law on the subject, and that with this view, action should be taken to test the powers of the local authority with regard to the control of overhead wires generally. This report was adopted by both Vestries, and proceedings are now being taken by the Vestry of St. Marylebone on behalf of the local authorities. 86 A letter was received from the Batch8-1965 Vestry of Newington, objecting to wires being stretched across the streets, and expressing the opinion that all wires should be laid underground. The Vestry, while agreeing with this opinion as a general principle, conceived that circumstances may arise in which an exception should be made to the rule, and accordingly endorsed the views of the Newington Vestry, with the qualification that wires should be laid underground, "so far as is consistent with the public interests." The action taken by the Vestry on the United Telephone Company's Bill, 1884, is stated on page 81. CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and of the present condition of the Parish. By Order, HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Clerk. Supplemental Report of Marks EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER, DURING THE YEAR 1883-4.

Permission has also been given in forty-three cases to open the roadway to repair water pipes, or for similar purposes. The cost of making good these openings is charged to the person taking out the license. COAL PLATES. During the past twelve months ninety-nine new coal plates were cut into the paving. ASPHALTE. In the months of August and September Beak Street and Smith's Court were paved with asphalte, an allowance being made by the contractors for the old pitching which previously formed the surface of these streets. One of the passages leading from the Haymarket to St. James's Market and the entrance to Blue Ball Yard, St. James's Street, have also been paved, as nuisances were frequently committed at these places, and it was thought asphalte could be much more easily cleansed than the former paving. A contract for paving Poland Street with asphalte has been entered into, and the work was commenced on the 24th of March. The asphalte laid in Beak Street, Smith's Court, and Blue Ball Yard, and now being laid in Poland Street, is compressed asphalte, two inches thick, on six inches of Portland cement concrete; that in the passage leading to St. James's Market being mastic asphalte one inch thick. The contractors in each case were the "Societe Francaise des Asphaltes." WOOD PAVING Has been laid in the following streets in lieu of the old pitching or macadam: — 91 Name of Street. Part of Street Paved. Date when paved. Area of Wood Paving in yards super. Cost per yard super. Credit for old Pitching per yard super. Description of Paving and Name of Contractor.

STREET NAMES. The sum of £6 9s. 9d. has been expended in purchasing and fixing street name-plates; the greater portion being for altering Silver Street to Beak Street, in accordance with the order of the Metropolitan Board of Works. LIGHTING. Six new lamps have been erected during the past year, viz.: 1 in Beak Street at the corner of Great Pulteney Street. 1 in Heddon Street. 2 in Little Pulteney Street. 1 (Bray's Lamp) on new Refuge, St. James's Street. 1 at Urinal, Coach & Horses Yard. Fourteen lamps have been discontinued lighting, viz.: 1 in Piccadilly, at the corner of Great Windmill Street. 1 in Piccadilly, at the corner of the Haymarket. 2 in St. James's Street by new Refuge. 1 in Bidgood's Yard, Heddon Street. 2 in Rupert Street. 1 in Great Windmill Street. 1 in Queen's Head Court. 1 in Little Pulteney Street. 3 in Great Crown Court. 1 in Jermvn Street (temporary). One lamp by Messrs. Pickford & Co.'s premises in Berwick Street, has been altered to burn five feet of gas per hour instead of three feet as previously. The cost of repairing the large Refuge Lamps has been very great. They are fifteen in number, and have been broken, on the 93 average, rather more than three times each during the year; the amount being as follows:— £ s. d. Repairing lamps 24 10 9 New meter box 3 10 0 Meter box keys 0 17 6 £28 18 3 The ordinary street lamps are kept in repair by the Gas Company. REPAIRING SEWERS. In the autumn one of the small subsidiary sewers, running through the vaults in Regent Street, was found to be partially stopped, and as it had not a proper fall, it was considered necessary that it should be destroyed, and pipes substituted; and this was done accordingly. The cost of repairing sewers, bricking up old disused drains, &c:, has amounted to the sum of £137 12s. 3d. for the year. GULLIES. Sixty gullies have been reconstructed, altered, or repaired, as found necessary, at a cost of £396. Of those reconstructed, ten were in St. James's Street, two in St. James's Place, eight in Beak Street, seven in Wax-dour Street, and eight in Poland Street; and in three of these cases a new connection was made to the sewer. CLEANSING SEWERS AND GULLIES. The cost of labour for cleansing the sewers was £166 19s. 4½d., and for emptying 381 gullies, on the average ten times each, £45 7s. DETRITUS. One hundred and forty-five loads of detritus and accumulation have been removed from the sewers and gullies, at a cost of £71 13s. 94 CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Twenty-four new connections from houses have been made tothe sewers by men in the employ of your Yestry. FLUSHING. Sixty-five small sewers have been flushed, as became necessary, by the Yestry's workmen, the cost of the water for the same being £18 4s. URINALS. It being thought requisite to have another urinal in or near Regent Street, a site was selected in Heddon Street, and plans were prepared and passed by the Vestry, and instructions given for the erection of a circular ornamental iron urinal, but owing to the great opposition of the inhabitants of Heddon Street, the work was not commenced. In consequence of the Grand Junction Waterworks Company having given a constant supply of water to some of the streets in the parish, an alteration has been made to the flushing apparatus at several of the urinals so as to keep water constantly running. The following have been the expenses for the year: £ s. d. £ s. d. Cost of water (this includes meter rents) 151 7 6 Blenheim Street— New supply valve 2 9 0 Repairing pipes 1 5 0 Painting 9 7 6 Repairing lamp 0 2 6 13 4 0 Broad Street— Taking down old fittings and refixing new 10 0 0 Painting 13 2 6 Repairing lamp 0 16 6 23 19 0 Carried forward £188 10 6 95  £ s. d. £ s. d.

In December, tenders were invited for painting the ironwork of the stoneyard, and that of Mr. Cock, of Wardour Street, £29 10s., was accepted, and the work carried out. MACHINE BROOMS. From the constant and severe wear the machine brooms receive, they require refilling with new bass, on the average, every seven weeks. Formerly the brooms had a small wheel in front, but owing to continual friction this was always out of repair. The machines have been altered, and this wheel removed; and they now work very much better. The cost of alterations, sundry repairs, and refilling, has amounted to the sum of £53 12s. 6d. WATERING. The water-carts during the year were supplied by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington; the carts being hired by the day. The terms of the contract have been altered, the method of supervision re-arranged, and a fresh contract entered into with Mr. Mead for the ensuing three years, which provides for the work being carried out as efficiently, and probably at less cost, than the former one. STAND-POSTS. But few repairs have been necessary to the stand-posts during the year; what have been done amount to the sum of £5 16s. DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The contract for dusting and slopping has been carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a cost of £4,000; but as your Vestry thought this amount too great now, owing to the large increase in the area of wood paving and asphalte, they terminated this contract, and entered into a fresh one with Mr. H. Covington, who undertakes to do the work for the sum of £3,200 97 per annum, a saving to the ratepayers of £800. In addition to the work carried out by Mr. Mead, Mr. Covington has also to remove the gully slop and sewer deposit, and provide the men to sweep behind the slop carts. This will effect a further saving of £350, or altogether a total of £1,150. I am, Rev. Sir, and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, HENRY MONSON, Surveyor to the Vestry. D 99 St. James, Westminster.

Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, for the year 1883. The Census of 1881 gives the District of the Parish of St. James as covering an area of 162 acres, and containing a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub-District appears as covering an area of 54 acres, and containing a population of 11,585. The Berwick Street Sub-District appears as covering an area of 108 acres, and containing a population of 18,280. The mean density of the population appears as 181 per acre, and the net mortality for the year 1883 was 501—a death-rate of 16-8 per 1,000. The density of the population in the Golden Square Sub-District appears as 215 persons per acre, and that of the Berwick Street Sub-District as 169 persons per acre. 128 The mortality from Zymotic diseases during the year has been 18, and there have been in addition, 3 other deaths among Zymotic cases removed from the Parish to extra-Parochial Hospitals. Vide table II., page 137. Of Fever, Small Pox, and Diphtheria, 53 cases came under notice during the year; but many cases may not have been known, there being as yet no law requiring that notice of such cases be given to the Sanitary Authority. Of these 53 cases, 1 was of Small Pox, 7 of Enteric or Typhoid Fever, 44 of Scarlet Fever, and 1 of Diphtheria. Thirty-five cases—1 of Small Pox, 4 of Enteric Fever, and 30 of Scarlet Fever—were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. During the year 1883, 40 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. In 17 cases bodies were removed from the presence of families generally living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the living would have lived and slept in the presence of a decomposing corpse, upon which, possibly, a post mortem examination would have to be made before the interment could take place. In 9 cases the bodies have been removed from hotels or lodging-houses. Twenty-two Inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 18 post mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room which adjoins the Mortuary. 129 The following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1883.

EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P. Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, During the year 1883, under the provisions of the Sale of .Food and Drugs' Act, 1875, 66 samples were examined, all being procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. In January of the year 1883, peremptory warnings were sent to several milk vendors in the Parish as to the quality of the milk which they were found to be selling. Notices also were sent out with regard to the sale of coffee, cocoa, and mustard, which, when in any way mixed, the law required to be labelled "sold as a mixture," or made the vendors liable to prosecution under the adulteration acts. In the first quarter of the year 1883, it was found, on analysis of the specimens procured, that these warnings had not been taken seriously, and thereupon prosecutions were ordered by the Vestry. In the course of the year 1883. 46 specimens of milk have been examined. During the first quarter, out of 21 specimens, 1 was 149 found to he "very poor," and 5 to be "poor." During the second quarter, out of 12 specimens examined 2 were found to he "poor," and their vendors were warned; 1 specimen was found to he adulterated with 25% of added water, and, upon prosecution, the vendor was fined five pounds and costs. During the third quarter, out of fourteen specimens examined four were found to he adulterated,— 1 specimen contained 23% added water, and, upon prosecution, a fine of twenty shillings and costs was inflicted; 1 specimen contained 20 % added water, and, on prosecution, a fine of forty shillings and costs was inflicted; 1 specimen contained 13 % of added water, and, on prosecution, a fine of ten shillings and costs was inflicted; 1 specimen contained 24% of added water, but, on prosecution, the summons was dismissed on a legal technicality. In one case, where coffee mixed with 20% of chicory was sold without being labelled "sold as a mixture," the vendor was fined ten shillings and costs. In no case has the accuracy of the analyses been successfully contested. In no case was any poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend from the Vestry has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 150 PARISH OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER.
