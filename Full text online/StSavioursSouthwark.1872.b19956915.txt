CLERK'S REPORT. The intention of this Art, intituled "An Act to amend the Law for the prevention of Adulteration of Food and Drink and of Drugs," is, as expressed in the preamble thereof, to repress the practice of adulterating articles of food, &c., in fraud of Her M j< tv >uL»j■ t . to the . r» tt hurt of their health, and dan^c i of their lives. Sim tion • > - onstitutes the Vestries and District Boards of this metropolis the « \< < utive authority, and empowers them to appoint publi- analysts, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board. In nlance with this section, the t. Saviour's Di.tri.t Boanl have appointed their Medical Officer Mr. Robert Bianchi, a-> the analyst for their District, an • Errington ;i- In-peet«»r. who i- eharged with the duty o receiving and pun hairing sampl< - for analysis.

Adulteration Act, 35 and 36 Vict., cap. 74. 4 Sunday Trading. llackfriars Koad Pavinp. Loans and Annuities. Constant Water Supply. "With a view to lessen ns far as possible the increasing evils arising from Sunday Trading, the Board have given notico of their intention to enforce the closing of all shops and business premises throughout the District on Sunday mornings (except as otherwise provided by law) by half-past ten o'clock ; and in all cases where such notice is not complied with, they intend to institute proceedings for recover}' of the penalties or forfeitures which by law are directed against sunday trading. The Board are now in treaty with the Metropolitan Boanl for a Loan, under the Loans Act of 1870, of £3,000, in order to completo the paving of the carriage-way of so much of the Blackfriars Koad to the parish boundary as yet remains unpaved ; the principal sum to be repayable in fifteen years, by annual instalments of £200, with interest quarterly at 3j per cent. The whole of Mr. Buxton's Loan of £3,500 is now repaid, and the Annuities of Mr. John Howe and Mrs. Frances Freer havo lapsed by their death. Mrs. Freer's annuity of £1G5 was paid in consideration of an advance made in the year 1837 to the Clink Commissioners, one of the Trusts succeeded to by this Boanl; and Mr. Howe's annuity of £83 6s. 8d. was a superannuation allowance awanled to him on his retirement from the office of surveyor in April, 1868. It appearing that great expense would be entailed upon owners • of house property if the Water Regulations as approved by the Board of Trade were carried out, and that the benefits of a constant supply were likely to be neutralised by the severity of tho restrictions; this Boanl concurred in the Metropolitan Boanl's determination not to take action at present for enforcing the regulations, but to await fresh legislation on the subject. Gas Supply. In February, Petitions were prepared by the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields against the Bills in Parliament of " The Gas Light and Coke Company," and "The Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company;" and this Board, who had appointed delegates to attend the meetings which were being held at St. Martin's Vestry Ilall to watch the progress of these Bills, being advised that many of the clauses of both Bills were highly objectionable, resolved to oppose the same: accordingly the common seal of this Board was affixed to the Petitions, which also bore the seals of several other Vestries and Boards, and as a result of the joint opposition, the former Bill was amended so as to deprive it of its worst features and the latter Bill was thrown out. 5 Crossing Sweepers. The Boanl thinking tin crvioet rendered by the crossing•weepers were not an equivalent to the rate-payers for the cost incurred by their employment, hare discharged them. Five men were employ. d at a total cost for last vcar of about £200. Precepts. Demand* in thr form of Prec-pts, necessitating the issuing of ^corresponding Precept* to the Overseers by this Board, have been made by the Metropolitan Hoard of Works and the School Board for London, during the twelve months as under, viz.: Ceristchurch.

Gentlemen, The pleasure I have in presenting to your notice my Annual Report is greatly enhanced by the very favourable account I am enabled to give of the sanitary condition of your District for the vear ending December 31st, 1872. There were during that period 1,114 Births, viz., 555 in the parish of Christchurch and 559 in that of St. Saviour. The number of Deaths in the District amounted to 683, of which, 361 occurred in C'hristchurch parish, while St. Saviour's numbered 322, the excess of Births over the number of Deaths being 131 ; but by far the most gratifying feature that 1 have to present is, that the mortality from diseases supposed to be preventable by sanitary precautions has declined to a very considerable extent,—the total decrease in the number of Deaths from epidemic diseases being 46, in comparison with the number in the year ending 1871. Such pleasing results cannot fail to have a beneficial effect in removing any doubts, if such could exist, of the vital importance of stringent sanitary measures. The following extract from a Table which I have carefully prepared, shewing in detail the comparison of the number of deaths from epidemic diseases in St. Saviour's District in 1872 and the preceding year, will afford a simple and at the same time most favourable illustration of the subject, and will doubtless be rend with interest. The decrease in the number of deaths from Small-pox compared with those in the previous year is 50, viz., 15 against 65; a most remarkable evidence of the efficacy of vaccination as a preventive to that terrible epidemic. I am anxious while on this important subject to state my decided conviction that Small-pox might not only bo controlled, but entirely eradicated by perseverance in successful vaccination and re-vaccination. I would here refer to the statistics in the report of Dr. C. MeCAnn, Medical Superintendent of the Stockwell Small-pox Hospital, in which he shows that while the mortality in vaccinated cases is 11.8 per cent., in those cases where vaccination has been neglected it shows a percentage of m 7 M :> This ^t.11« mi nt argues n,ost favourably in support of the ' h;m rxPTemedot t1"' efficacy of vaccination efficiently [???]■tocrfunn..!, and should go far to confute those prejudices which lanfortunat, ly exist through ignorance, and tcaeh a lesson to parents y othont ha™** the care of children of the necessity of mrnilin^ themselves of the suggested remedy, which happily i8 ipla-.d immediately within the n ,, h of all.' Again, referring to ■ty Tabular statement, wc find that the decrease in the mortality >fn»m S. arlet Fi \« r during th. smie period is M, there having aocrurr.<1 but i> death*» from that epidemic compared with 20 in (the previous \-ar, while th. Table shows a slight increase in ICas< - "| 1 >iai rh.i a, w ln< h wa- at oin period of tlie year unusually rprevahnt. and an ill. r.-ose of two . ,m, of death from Measles, and oik i! II ping Cough; there was also returned by the Registrar ton« death from Cholera as < ompared with two from the same icauM- in 1H71. We were threaten* <1 in the latter part of the year 1872 with th< n pp ii n of He lapsing Fever; on the 23rd of October a \ tang i n w • Imitt■ ■ I int'> Guv' Hospital, having previously liv. i in Kwer Street, with all the symptoms characteristic of a t% pi. d c i■■ of relapsing fever. <hi making enquiry as to the pi'1 f this ntta.k, I as.ertained that his father had been into Kent, hopping, and n turned to his house in Ewer Street, Where he had )>oeB seised with rigors soon after his arrival, pllowed bv an atta. k of relapsing fever; his wife, who nursed him. was th. n s, i /i 11 with tin same disease; a woman from Spiller's Court. Webber Street, was sent by the Relieving Hloer to the hoiisf a- nurse, she was soon after attacked with similar symptom*, and on going home to Spiller's Couit, Comniuni. ated the disease to her six children; she and they were ■it once removed to the Fever Hospital at Stockwcll, and the house was thoroughly disinfected. Two other cases lia^e since oci urn <1 in Broadwal 1; they were removed to the Fever Hospital, and the housi s thoroughly disinfected, since a\ lii< li, no otlui persons have 1 e-n attacked. I would in this plai c obsmc that as an effectual preventive against the appeal am < of inf(<ti and contagious diseases, that it cannot be too guuialh that wc have a brick chamber complete with every appliance 8 for disinfecting clothing, nnd thnt any inhabitant of the district may have bedding, clothes, &c. disinfected free of cost by applying to the Inspector at the Boanl Room. No. 3, Emerson Street, Bankside. The deaths in Christehurch Workhouse amounted to 76 as against 99 in the previous year, whilst the deaths from epidemics in that Institution were exactly the same, viz., 2 from Diarrhoea. I have made analytical and microscopical examinations of the water supplied during last year, and reported as to its character; further, I would add Frofcssor Frankland's testimony, who in his Report says, that— " The mean temperature of the water supplied by the Southwark Company during 1872 was 13.3, and that of Lambeth 12.5. In 100,000 parts of the water supplied from the above sources, I find the mean weight of total solid impurity to be in the Southwark Company 26.91, and that of Lambeth 27.53 ; in organic carbon, .259 and .281 respectively; in organic nitrogen, Southwark .039, and Lambeth .043. Ammonia was detected in the proportion of .001 both in the Southwark and Lambeth supply ; the mean amount of previous sewage or animal contamination is estimated in the water supplied by the Southwark Company at 1,637, and in that of Lambeth at 1,882. Taking the water supplied by the Kent Company as a standanl (which enjoys the enviable distinction of being comparatively free from the presence of organic matters), the mean proportional amount of organic elements were found to be in the Southwark Company's water—compared with the six other sources of supply to the metropolis for the whole year—5.9, and that of Lambeth 6.6. This comparison is most unfavourable as reganls the character of the quality of the water delivered by the Lambeth Company's mains, the amount of organic contamination being more than double in proportion than that supplied by the New River Company. 1 find, also, that the removal of the intake of the Lambeth Company from Thames Ditton to a position between Hampton and Sunbury has hitherto been attended with no improvement in the quality of the water supplied; the inefficiency of its filtration has caused its turbidity to be in no degree diminished, while microscopic examination of matters in suspension has detected living and moving 9 organisms upon no fewer than six occasions in 1872. The lastmentioned remark, it is but fair to state, will not apply in the same degree to the Southwark Company, a", in the comparison of the four year during which time these microscopic tests have been continued, the living matters observed in the samples obtained from that I Company were present in l869 upon eight occasions, they were detected in 1872 upon one occasion only." In concision, I I* g to invite your perusal of the appended Tabh • ■ win- h I have r- t< rred. and also of that which epitomizes the s initary labours in which your Inspector of Nuisances has taken hi* arm«tomed a« tive part. It only remains for me to [record my thank* for the kin<lness and courtesy I have uniformly | received from all MemlKTs of the Board and its Officers.
