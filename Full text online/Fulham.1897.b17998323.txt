To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year 1897. The statistics of Marriages, Births, Deaths, and Infectious Diseases relate to the 52 weeks ending January Ist, 1898. Population. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on March 29th, 1896, was 113,781, having increased from 91,640 during the preceding ten years. The population in the middle of 1897, as calculated in the usual manner on the hypothesis that the rates of increase which prevailed between 1891 and 1896 have been maintained since, was 120,040, and on this figure the statistics in this report are based. AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION. The following Table gives the estimated number of persons living in Fulham at different ages, assuming the age constitution of the district to be the same as in 1891, no particulars of age having been required to be given at the Census of 1896 :— Under 5 16,925 5 to 15 27,009 15 „ 2 5 20,647 25 „ 35 21,607 35 „ 45 1 5 ,245 45 „ 55 9,363 55 „ 6 5 5,402 65 „ 75 2,881 Over 75 961 120,040 Assuming the proportion of males to females to be the same as in 1896, there are 56,702 males, and 63,338 females. The following Table gives the number of persons at different ages in Fulham, London, and other areas, expressed in per centages of the total population :— 35-45 55-65 65-75 Over 75 25-35 45-55 Under 5 15-25 5-15 2.4 18.0 0.8 Fulham 14.1 22.5 17.2 7.8 12.7 4.5 11.9 8.7 5.2 London 12.4 1.0 20.5 20.1 17.3 2.9 8.8 6.7 2.0 10.7 Rural Districts 23.7 17.8 4.6 12.3 13.4 1.0 11.8 5.3 8.5 3.0 Urban Districts 12.3 22.5 19.9 15.7 15.1 5.7 1.3 England & Wales 22.8 11.5 8.6 12.3 19.3 3.4 The differences in the age constitution of the districts given in the above Table are considerable, and similar differences will be found in comparing the age and sex distribution in the various London districts; and as age and sex constitution has a considerable influence on the death-rate of a community, the recorded death-rates require correction before they can be used for purposes of comparison. The age and sex distribution in Fulham is more favourable to a low death-rate than that of England, but not so favourable as that of London as a whole, nor as that of the adjoining parishes. AREA OF THE DISTRICT AND DENSITY OF THE POPULATION. The area of Fulham is 1,701 acres, and there are 70.6 persons to the acre. The County of London has an average density of 59.8 persons, to an acre, ranging from 221, 212, and 195 in Whitechapel, St. George, Southwark, and St. George-in-the-East, to 18, 12, and 6 in Plumstead, Lewisham and Lee. When the available land in Fulham is all built upon, there will probably be about 110 persons to the acre. Marriages and Marriage Rate. 1,028 marriages were celebrated in Fulham during the year, the numbers in the three preceding years being 789, 809, and 916. The marriage rate, i.e., persons married per 1,000 inhabitants was 17.1, the rate for the County of London being 18.5, and that for England and Wales 16.0. Births and Birth Rate. The births registered in the year numbered 4,106, 2,127 males and 1,979 females. There was one birth to every 29.5 inhabitants, and 100 births of males to 93.1 of females. The 4,106 births correspond to a birth-rate of 34.2, which is the lowest birth-rate recorded in Fulham. The rate for the County of London was 30.0, being also the lowest on record. Of the adjoining parishes the rates were, Kensington, 21.5 Hammersmith 29.7, and Chelsea 26.4. In the other sanitary districts of the Metropolis, the rates ranged from 13.3 in St. Martin's, 15.9 in the City, 17.1 in S. George's, Hanover Square, and 19.2 in Hampstead, to 38.2 in Mile End, 39.6 in Whitechapel, 42.5 in St. George-in-the-East, and 45.2 in St. Luke's. Of the 33 large towns of England and Wales, the highest rates were those of Gateshead 35.8, Liverpool 35.3, Salford 35.1, Sunderland 34.6, and Sheffield 34.4, and the lowest those of Brighton 24.7, Bradford 24.6, Huddersfield 23.4, and Halifax 22.5. The following Table gives the number of births registered in Fulham, together with the birth-rate during the previous 10 years.:— Males. Females. Total. Birth Rate. 1887 1458 2870 1412 39.3 1888 1577 1406 2983 38.2 1889 1522 1567 3089 37.2 1890 1 55 1 1 593 3144 35.7 1891 1814 1 733 3547 37.4 1892 1835 1761 3596 35.4 1893 1860 1851 3711 35.0 1894 1937 1826 3763 34.9 1895 1993 1937 3930 35.3 1896 2092 1976 4068 34.8 1897 4106 2127 1 979 34 .2 The mean rate for the 10 years 1887-1896 being 36.3. EXCESS OF BIRTHS OVER DEATHS The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was 2,076, compared with 1,866, 1,735, 2 ,025 in the three preceding years. ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. The births of illegitimate children numbered 167, 89 males and 78 females, forming 4.0 per cent. of the total births. STILL-BORN CHILDREN 165 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 25 births. Of these 137 were buried on the production of the certificate of a registered Medical Practitioner, and 28 on a declaration being made pursuant to 37 and 38, Vict, cap. 88, Sec. 18, by the father or mother of the child, or in default of these by the occupier of the house in which the birth took place, or a person who was present at the birth. Deaths and Death Rate The deaths of 2,240 persons—l,l45 males and 1,095 females — were registered in Fulham during the year, but of these 419, 215 males and 204 females, were of persons not resident in the district, who died in institutions situated within the parish, while the deaths of 209 persons, 133 males and 76 females belonging to Fulham occurred in institutions situated outside the parish. There were, therefore, 2,030 deaths of parishioners of Fulham, the mortality being at the rate of 16.9 per 1,000 living, which is the lowest death rate yet recorded in Fulham. The rate in the male sex was 18.7, and in the female 15.3. The death-rate of the County of London was 17.7, and of the three adjoining parishes that of Kensington was 15.7, of Hammersmith 16.7, and of Chelsea 17.7. The lowest death rates in the 43 sanitary districts into which the Metropolis is divided were 11.8 in Hampstead, 12.8 in Lewisham, and 13.2 in St. George, Hanover Square, and the highest rates were 25.1 in Limehouse, 25.7 in St. Luke's, and 26.4 in St. George's-in-the-East. Of the 33 large towns in England and Wales the lowest rates were those of Croydon 13.1, Cardiff 14.9, Brighton 15.1 and West Ham 15.7, and the highest those of Wolverhampton 22.5, Manchester 23.1, Salford 23.9, and Liverpool and Preston, 24.4. CORRECTION FOR AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION In comparing the death-rates of different areas it is necessary to have regard to the age and sex distribution of the several populations, and to correct the recorded crude death-rates by the proper factor. Corrected in this way, the death-rates of Fulham, the adjoining parishes, and the Metropolis were as under:— Fulham 1 7.7 Hammersmith 17.7 Kensington 17.3 Chelsea 18.9 County of London 18.9 The following Table gives the death-rates of Fulham and London, uncorrected for age and sex distribution during the previous 10 years:— Fulham Death-rate per 1,000. London Death-rate per 1,000. 1887 19.5 20.3 1888 19.1 19.3 1889 18.8 18.4 1890 21.7 21.4 1891 19.7 21.0 1892 20.0 20.3 1893 19.5 21.0 1894 17.9 17.4 1895 19.9 19.5 1896 17.5 18.2 1897 16.9 17.7 The mean rates for the 10 years 1887 to 1896 being:—Fulham 19.36, London 19.68. The difference between the rate for 1897, and the mean for the previous 10 years in Fulham, represents a saving of 293 lives. SEASONAL MORTALITY. The mortality in the four quarters of the year was as under: — Number of Deaths, Death-rate. 1st quarter 475 15.8 2nd 399 13.2 3rd 570 19.0 4th „ 5 86 19.5 DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS. The following Table gives the number of deaths and the death-rate in each of the wards, into which the parish is divided:— Number of Deaths. Death-rate. Barons Court Ward 166 13. 6 Hurlingham „ 98 17.2 Lillie „ 343 16.4 Margravine „ 372 18.8 Munster „ 307 18.2 Sands End „ 326 19.4 Town 129 12.9 Walham 276 17.5 Not specified 13 The above must be considered satisfactory, as no part of the parish is conspicuous by an exceptionally high death-rate. Mortality at Different Ages. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Of the 2,030 deaths registered, 662 or 32.6 per cent, were those of children under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was 161 deaths to 1,000 births as compared with 175, 177, 149, and 187, in the previous 4 years. The corresponding rate for the County of London was 159 deaths to 1,000 births, the rates in the various sanitary districts ranging from 116 in Plumstead, 121 in Stoke Newington, and 127 in Hampstead, to 190 in Bermondsey, 193 in Limehouse, 195 in St. Saviour's, and 197 in St. George's-in-the-East. In the large provincial towns, the rate average 189 per 1,000, among which it ranged from 141 in Huddersfield, 135 in Croydon, 140 in Swansea, 142 in Halifax, and 144 in Brighton, to 206 in Nottingham and in Blackburn, 214 in Birmingham, 217 in Woverhampton, 219 in Salford, 220 in Burnley, and 262 in Preston. Between the ages of 1 and 5 years 265 deaths were registered, so that the deaths of children under the age of 5 years numbered 927, or 46 per cent, of the total number of deaths. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 54.8 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age, the corresponding rate for the Metropolis being 60.7. The following table gives the infantile mortality in Fulham and London during the 5 years, 1893-1898: — Death of Infants under 1 year per 1,000 births. Fulham. London. Death-rate of Children under the age of 5 years. Fulham. London. 1893 177 164 62.5 68 .9 1894 149 143 62.6 60.6 1895 187 165 70.2 67.1 1896 175 161 64.8 66.8 1897 161 159 54.8 60.7 DEATHS OF ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. Sixty-two of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 371 deaths to 1,000 births, or more than twice as heavy as that of children born in wedlock. INSURANCE OF INFANTS. Certificates under the Friendly Societies Acts were issued in respect of 433 children under 5 years of age, and 70 in respect of those between 5 and 10 years. Thus 46 per cent, of those who died before the age of 5 years were insured. In the previous 4 years the proportions were 55, 48, 50, and 53 per cent. MORTALITY AT SCHOOL AGE. At the age of 5 to 15 years which is approximately the school period of life, there were 94 deaths corresponding to an annual rate of 3.5 per 1,000 of those estimated to be living at that age. MORTALITY AT ADOLESCENCE. Between the ages of 15 and 25 years, 70 deaths were recorded, the rate of mortality being 3.4 per 1,000. MORTALITY AT MATURITY. Between the ages of 25 and 65 years there were 657 deaths, representing a death-rate of 12.7. MORTALITY AT DECLINE. At the age of 65 years and upwards, 282 persons died, the death-rate at this age period being 73.4. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES. 360 deaths were due to the seven principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:— Smallpox Measles 50 Scarlet Fever 27 Diphtheria 63 Enteric Fever 12 Whooping Cough 61 Diarrhœa 147 These 360 deaths represent a death-rate of 3.00, while the corresponding rate of the County of London was 2.58 ; of the three adjoining parishes, that of Kensington was 1.78, that of Hammersmith 1.99, and that of Chelsea 2.55. In the various sanitary areas of the Metropolis the Zymotic death-rates ranged from no in St. Georges's, Hanover Square, 1.l6 in Hampstead and 1.19 in St. Martin's, to 4.07 in Shoreditch, 4.27 in St. George's-in-the-East, and 4.35 in St. George's, Southwark and Bermondsey. In the 32 large provincial towns the Zymotic death-rate averaged 3.05 , ranging from 1.36 in Swansea, 1.39 in Halifax, 1.43 in Croydon and 1.50 in Huddersfield, to 3.98 in Burnley, 4.02 in Bolton, 4.22 in Wolverhampton, 5.50 in Salford and 5.64 in Preston. During the past 10 years the number of deaths and the death-rate from these diseases have been as under:— Deaths. Death Rate. 1887 269 3 .6 1888 252 3.2 1889 243 2.9 1890 379 4.3 1891 211 2.3 1892 448 4.6 1893 344 3.3 1894 426 4.0 1895 345 3.1 1896 422 3.6 The mean of the 10 years being 3.5. COMPARATIVE MORTALITY FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES IN FULHAM, LONDON AND THE THREE ADJOINING DISTRICTS. The following Table shows the mortality from Zymotic diseases in Fulham as compared with London and the three adjacent parishes: — Disease.

The following Table gives the number of cases of infectious diseases notified in Fulham since 1890, when compulsory notification came into force, excluding duplicate notifications:— 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 Smallpox 3 32 40 2 2 Scarlet Fever 286 118 517 701 529 339 627 759 Diphtheria 96 70 69 230 329 368 341 378 Membranous Croup 18 23 13 15 20 13 14 1O Enteric Fever 58 72 5 1 41 37 57 53 53 Continued Fever - - 6 2 3 5 5 Typhus Fever 2 3 1 Cholera - - - 5 - 2 1 Puerperal Fever 6 18 6 9 10 10 9 14 Erysipelas 67 153 114 104 113 94 99 134 573 330 786 1224 1073 887 1152 1354 SMALLPOX. No case of Smallpox occurred in Fulham during the year, though 6 persons were reported as suffering from that disease, but in each case it was ascertained that an erroneous diagnosis had been made, 5 of them having Chicken Pox and 1 Erythema. SCARLET FEVER. 759 cases were notified of this disease, an increase of 132 cases as compared with last year. The disease, as is generally the case, was especially prevalent during the latter half of the year, the number of cases in the four quarters of the year being :— First Quarter 103 Second 122 Third „ 274 Fourth „ 260 The disease was somewhat more prevalent in Fulham than in the adjoining parishes and the rest of London, as will be seen from the following Table which gives the number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified per 1,000 of the population in Fulham, the three adjoining parishes and London in 1897 and the 7 previous years. Number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified per 1,000 inhabitants:— Average for 7 years 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1890-96 1897 Fulham 3.4 1.3 5.5 6.8 4.9 3.0 5.4 4.3 6.3 Kensington 2.3 1.9 4.3 5.6 2.3 3.1 6.0 3.6 4.4 Hammersmith 3.6 2.3 4.6 6.7 3.2 3 .6 5.1 4.1 3.7 Chelsea Home District 3.3 2.0 5.0 6.5 3.1 6 .6 5.7 4.6 4.1 London 3.7 2.7 6.4 8.6 4.3 4.5 5.8 5.1 5.1 The distribution of the cases was as under: — Cases Cases per 1,000 of the population Deaths Barons Court Ward 40 3.4 1 Hurlingham „ 34 5.1 1 Lillie „ 167 8.0 6 Margravine „ 157 7.9 7 Munster „ 101 6.0 3 Sands End „ 112 6.6 5 Town „ 38 3.9 3 Walham „ 110 7.0 1 568, or 75 per cent, of those suffering from this disease were removed to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Mortality.—Although more prevalent in Fulham than in any recent year, excepting 1893, the fatality of the disease was low, there being 27 deaths, representing a case mortality of 3 .6 per cent. Of the 568 removed to hospital 22 or 3.9 per cent., and of the 191 treated at home 5 or 2.6 per cent, died. Of late years there has been a marked decline in the fatality of Scarlet Fever, thus for the 10 years ending 1892 the average case mortality in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board was 9.3 per cent., while for the last 5 years the mortality has been as under:— Fulham Deaths per 100 cases notified London Deaths per 100 cases notified Metropolitan Asylum's Board's Hospital's Deaths per 100 cases admitted 1893 4.7 4.3 6.1 1894 1895 6.6 5.2 5.9 6.0 4.2 5 .2 1896 4.4 3.7 4.3 1897 3.7 3.4 In fact last year the mildness of the disease was one of the causes of its exceptional prevalence, as in many instances its nature was not recognised by the parents of the affected child and consequently no precautions were taken to prevent its spread until attention was called to it by the occurrence of desquamation or by other cases in the same house or neighbourhood, and doubtless there were many cases which were never discovered. In three cases in which it was clear that the parents knew what the children were suffering from, but did not call in any doctor and took no precautions to prevent the spread of infection, the Vestry took proceedings under the Public Health Act against the head of the family, for failing to send a notice to the Medical Officer of Health that the children were suffering from Scarlet Fever, and penalties were inflicted in each instance. In one of these cases the child was found in a laundry, where a considerable amount of work was being done, peeling freely. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. The accommodation provided by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for patients suffering from Scarlet Fever again proved quite inadequate, and from July to November there was always delay in the removal of patients owing to the hospitals being full, and at times there were as many as 20 patients in Fulham awaiting removal. RETURN CASES. In 12 instances the disease occurred within 10 days of the return of a child living in the same house from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals after recovery from a similar attack. DIPHTHERIA. 378 cases of Diphtheria and 10 of Membranous Croup which is identical with Laryngeal Diphtheria were notified, the numbers for the preceding three years being 342, 386 and 355. The distribution of the cases was as follows:— Cases Cases per 1,000 of the population Deaths Barons Court Ward 20 1.7 4 Hurlingham „ 15 2.8 4 Lillie „ 58 2.8 8 Margravine „ 42 2.1 9 Munster „ 55 3.3 9 Sands End Town „ 127 7.5 19 11 1.1 1 Walham „ 60 3.8 9 The disease being again much more prevalent in the Sands End Ward than in the rest of the parish. 2 53, or 65 per cent, of those certified to be suffering from the disease were removed to the hospital. Mortality.—Although the number of cases notified was the highest recorded, the fatality was lower than in any year since 1892, there being 62 deaths from the disease, giving a case mortality of 16.3 per cent, as compared with 26.1 per cent, in 1893, 31.6 per cent, in 1894, 20.0 in 1895, and 22 per cent, in 1896. Of the 253 patients removed to hospital 39, or 15.4 per cent, died, and of the 135 treated at home 24, or 17.8 died. The following Table shows the fatality at different age-periods of the cases treated at home and of those removed to hospital:— Cases removed to Hospital Cases treated at home Age No. of Cases Deaths Mortality per cent.

COMPARATIVE PREVALENCE OF DIPHTHERIA IN FULHAM. In London Diphtheria showed a somewhat decreased prevalence in 1897, the cases notified being 13,192 against 13,808 in 1896, but they were in excess of those notified in any other year. The disease showed the highest proportional prevalence in Hackney, Holborn, Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Mile End, Poplar and Camberwell sanitary areas. The comparative prevalence and fatality of Diphtheria in Fulham, the adjoining parishes and London will be seen from the two following Tables which give the rates of incidence and fatality of the disease in the several localities:— Cases notified per 1,000 Inhabitants.

This was at once done, the class room being closed from May 27th to June 9th, with satisfactory results, as excluding secondary cases occurring in the same family, there were only two other cases among the children attending that school, who were notified on May 31st and June Ist respectively, but on June 7th four children residing in a house in New Kings Road were notified as suffering from Diphtheria, and on investigation it was ascertained that another member of the family, who was in the second standard in the girls' department at Harwood Road School, had been ill with a sore throat about a fortnight or three weeks before, but the illness had been of so mild a character that no medical practitioner had been called in. This child had probably had a mild attack of Diphtheria, and as she was attending school up to May 26th, when the school was closed, it is quite possible that the outbreak in the particular class-room originated with her. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. As in July the accommodation at the Hospitals for Diphtheria showed signs of exhaustion, and there was at times some delay in the removal of patients, the Vestry again urged the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum's Board, in view of the relative fatality of the two diseases, to provide more beds for cases of Diphtheria, even if by so doing they had to lessen their accommodation for cases of Scarlet Fever, and a reply was received from the Managers to the effect that this would be done. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SUSPECTED CASES OF DIPHTHERIA. The Vestry have made arrangements with the British Institute of Preventive Medicine for the bacteriological examination of suspected cases of Diphtheria. Medical practitioners are furnished with sterile swabs and tubes for the collection of the membrane or secretion from suspected throats, and they are informed of the result of the examination within twenty-four hours. During the last four months 48 cases were examined in this way, in 30 of which the bacillus diphtheria was isolated. Errors in Diagnosis.—Of 141 patients admitted into the Western Hospital 8 or 5.6 per cent, were found after sojourn in the hospital to be suffering from other diseases. In 1896 the corresponding percentage was 12.8. ENTERIC FEVER. Fifty-three cases were notified, or 4.4 per 10,000 inhabitants, the average number for the preceding eight years being 4.5 per 10,000. In London and the adjoining parishes the cases notified were: — Cases notified per 10,000 inhabitants. County of London 6.9 Kensington 6.2 Hammersmith 4.2 Chelsea 5.4 MORTALITY. The disease was the cause of twelve deaths, giving a case mortality of 22.6 per cent., the average for the past four years being 19.2. The death rate from the disease in Fulham, London, and the adjoining parishes was: — Fulham 0.10 Kensington 0.12 Hammersmith 0.08 Chelsea 0.15 London 0.13 There were no cases attributable to the Maidstone epidemic, but in six cases the disease was contracted outside London, and in three cases in other sanitary districts of the metropolis. In three cases the disease was thought to have been due to the consumption of shellfish. CONTINUED FEVER. Five cases were notified as " Continued Fever," all occurring in the practise of one practitioner. There was no reason to suspect that any of these were cases of Enteric Fever. PUERPERAL FEVER. Fourteen cases were notified, of which 8 or 57 per cent, proved fatal, being in the proportion of 1.7 deaths to 1,000 births. CHOLERA. One person was certified as suffering from Cholera, but there was no reason to believe that the disease was other than what is known as English Cholera. ERYSIPELAS. 134 cases were notified of this diseases, and it was the cause of 3 deaths. Deaths from Non-Notifiable Zymotic Diseases. MEASLES. The district was free from Measles until October, when it made its appearance in the Sand's End and Lillie Wards, and speedily became prevalent throughout the district, though the epidemic has not been quite so severe as those of 1896 and 1897. The deaths due to the disease numbered 50, representing a death-rate of 0.42 per 1,000 for the year, being much below the mean rate for the previous ten years, which was o.80, but for the last quarter the death rate from Measles was 1.6. The death rate of the County of London was almost the same as that of Fulham, viz. : 0.43, two-thirds of the deaths occurring in the last quarter, but the disease was, up to the end of the year, comparatively absent from the adjoining parishes, the death-rates being : Kensington 0.19, Hammersmith 0.05, and Chelsea 0.18, though the epidemic has since spread to them. The distribution of the deaths was as follows:— Baron's Court Ward 3 Hurlingham „ 1 Lillie „ 17 Margravine „ 3 Munster „ 7 Sands End „ 14 Town „ 1 Walham „ 4 The disease was mainly prevalent among very young children, as while 455 children attending the infants' departments of the various Board Schools in Fulham were reported by the teachers as absent owing to their having Measles, only 39 were reported as so suffering in the girls' and boys' departments, though, of course, a large number were excluded on account of the existence of Measles in their homes, and from what I could gather the disease appeared to have been very prevalent among children too young to attend school before it showed itself to any extent among school children. The infants' departments of all the Board Schools were more or less affected, and that department of the Lillie Road School, and some of the infant class-rooms of the Langford Road School were, by arrangement with the Medical Officer of the School Board, closed for a short time, but in several other Board Schools there was no marked prevalence of the disease until about the second or third week of December, so that in view of the near approach of the Christmas holidays it was not deemed necessary to close the departments. Among the factors which, in addition to the influence of the primary schools, tend to spread the disease may be reckoned the carelessness and ignorance of parents who make no attempt to prevent their children who are suffering from the disease from associating with others, it being no uncommon thing for children to be found attending school who are obviously suffering from the disease. With a view of preventing this and of endeavouring to bring home to parents the fact that Measles is a dangerous infectious disease, the Vestry have requested the Local Government Board to sanction the application to Measles, in addition to the other diseases specified in the Act, of the provisions of Section 68 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which render a person liable to a penalty who, " while suffering from any dangerous infectious disease, wilfully exposes himself without proper precautions against spreading the disease, or being in charge of any person so suffering, so exposes such sufferer." To this request the Local Government Board have replied " that the question of extending certain of the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to diseases other than those specified in Section 55 of the Act is one which would be more satisfactorily considered with regard to the metro polis as a whole than with regard to individual sanitary districts. Under Sections 56 (b) and 58 this could be done by the London County Council with the Board's approval, and the Board would suggest that, in the first instance, if the Vestry are desirable that the provisions of Section 68 should be made applicable to Measles, they should bring the matter under the attention of the County Council." The Vestry have accordingly communicated with the London County Council on the matter. With regard to the question of the notification of Measles, I would reiterate my opinion that a modified system of notification of Measles should be tried, by which the first attack in every house invaded shall be notified, but no subsequent case occurring in the same house within thirty days ; and, as in so many cases no doctor is called in, it would also be essential to enforce dual notification by the parent or guardian as well as by the doctor, and the exception as to secondary cases should apply only to notification by the medical practitioner. I must also again draw attention to the necessity of providing hospital accommodation for the children of the poor when suffering from Measles—not so much on the ground of the necessity for isolation, but for the sake of the welfare of the patients, as a large proportion of those who succumb to the disease would be saved if they could be removed from the unfavourable conditions by which they are surrounded and treated in a rational manner. WHOOPING COUGH. Sixty-one deaths were ascribed to this disease, being 14 below the decennial average, allowing for the increase of the population, the death - rate being 0-50, and that of the metropolis o'4i. Like Measles, this is unfortunately too commonly looked upon as a very trivial ailment, and not merely are no precautions taken to prevent its spread, but comparatively little care is taken of the sufferers, who so frequently succumb to one of the pulmonary complications induced by neglect, so that more deaths are due to it than to any other Zymotic disease except Diarrhoea and Measles; moreover in those who apparently recover some permanent organic mischief often remains, which ultimately proves fatal. DIARRHCEA. Under the heading Diarrhoea are included several different affections confounded with one another on account of the presence of Diarrhcea as a symptom, but there is no doubt that Summer Diarrhcea, to which the majority of the deaths were due, is essentially a specific disease. 147 deaths were registered from Diarrhoea, the average for the previous 10 years being 130. In addition to these, the majority of the deaths of infants, 63 in number, ascribed to Gastro Enteritis or Gastro Enteric Catarrh were of the same nature, and it is certainly advisable that all these deaths should be reckoned under the head of Diarrhoea for comparative purposes, as some practitioners seldom return a death as due to Diarrhcea, but nearly always to Gastro Enteritis, so that the number of deaths really due to Diarrhoea may be much understated. The disease was in excess in Fulham as compared with the metropolis and the adjacent parishes, but not to so marked an extent as has generally been the case, as will be seen from the following table, which gives the Diarrhceal death-rate of Fulham, London and the three adjoining parishes for 1897 and the previous 10 years :— 1885—1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895. '896. 1897. Fulham 1.05 0.94 1.3o O.53 1'18 1.15 1.21 Kensington ... O·51 O·4l o'6o O-33 O·68 O·35 O·070 Hammersmith... 1·05 0·70 O·079 0·46 0·79 o·8o 1-20 Chelsea 0.77 0·77 0·76 0·34 0·82 0·67 1·03 London 059 o·6o o·8o 0·41 0·82 0·71 0·92 In London the death-rate from Diarrhcea was higher than in any year since 1868, and of the large provincial towns the highest rates were those of Sheffield 1'81, Liverpool I-93, Salford 2-0, Birmingham 2 o, Wolverhampton, 2·II, Preston 2'22, and Hull 2'23. On reference to Table J, it will be seen that the summer rise of Diarrheal mortality did not commence until the mean temperature recorded by the three-foot earth thermometer had attained 6o° Fahrenheit, and that, as is usually the case, the maximum mortality occurred in the week in which the temperature recorded by the three-foot earth thermometer attained its maximum. In connection with the heavy DiarrhOeal mortality, I would again draw the attention of the Vestry to the necessity for the more frequent removal of horse refuse during the summer months, and also to the need for the better scavenging of our streets, which, in common with most streets outside the City of London, are not remarkable for their cleanliness, as some recent observations of Dr. Klein's show that a particular bacillus is often responsible for epidemic Diarrhoea, and that this is to be found in sewage, sewage effluent, and in exceptionally large numbers in horse dung, so that it is abundant in the dust of our streets, and probably accounts for some of the deaths of children from Diarrhoea. INFLUENZA. Nineteen deaths were directly attributed to Influenza, as compared with 25, 13, 66 and 13 in the four preceding years. ZOOGENOUS DISEASES. One death was ascribed to Glanders : that of a man who had been employed in some stables in New King's Road where a number of horses were affected with the disease. VENEREAL DISEASES. These were the cause of 12 deaths, 10 being due to Congenital Syphilis. SEPTIC DISEASES, Five deaths were due to septic diseases other than Puerperal Fever and Erysipelas. Class III.—Dietetic Diseases. Six deaths were certified to be directly due to alcoholic excess, and in 15 cases the disease to which death was attributed was stated to have been accelerated by intemperance, though these probably represent but a small proportion of the actual number. Class IV.—Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from diseases in this group numbered 379, being 187 per cent, of the total number. TUBERCULAR DISEASES. Of these 184 were due to Phthisis and 67 to other tubercular diseases, such as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica, and General Tuberculosis, these diseases thus accounting for 12-4 per cent, of the deaths from all causes, and it is probable that many of the deaths ascribed to Marasmus, Debility and Convulsions were Tubercular in origin. The following Table gives the Phthisis death-rates of Fulham and the adjoining parishes of London for the past five years:— 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 Fulham 1·5 1 1.42 1·40 1·66 1·53 Kensington 1·57 1·53 1·49 1·42 1·44 Hammersmith 1·56 1·51 1·56 1·40 1·39 Chelsea 1·75 1·64 1·92 1.82 1.80 London 1.90 1.7 1.77 1.68 1.71 The report of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis has just been presented to Parliament. The terms of the inquiry were : " What administrative measures are available and would be desirable for checking the danger to man through the use, as food, of the meat and milk of tuberculous animals; —what are the considerations which should govern the action of the responsible authorities in condemning, for the purpose of food, supplies, carcasses, or meat exhibiting any stage of tuberculosis." The Commissioners express the strongest opinion in favour of public over private slaughter-houses, and recommend that local authorities should have power, when once a public slaughter-house has been established, to declare that no other place shall be used for slaughtering purposes; they say that " the use of public slaughter-houses in populous places, to the exclusion of all private ones, is a necessary preliminary to a uniform and equitable system of meat inspection." They would require a meat inspector to pass an examination in the subject of meat inspection, but they would not insist that he should be a veterinary surgeon. With regard to the condemnation of the meat of tuberculous animals, they propose that when the disease is localised the carcass should be passed, and should only be condemned when the disease is generalised. On the most important question of the milk supply, they comment on the lack of powers possessed by local authorities to control the danger to man from the sale of milk of tuberculous animals, even when the udder is diseased, and recommend that facilities such as those given in certain local Acts, with the view of preventing the sale of tuberculous milk, shall be provided in an extended form, and they also advise that all diseases of the udder and all cows which exhibit outward symptoms of tuberculosis shall be notified, and urge the Board of Agriculture to assist farmers in eliminating the disease by manufacturing and offering a supply of " Tuberculin" for diagnostic purposes, together with the services of a veterinary surgeon, gratuitously. As regards cow-sheds they recommend that 600 to 800 cubic feet of space for each animal should be a minimum in populous places, and that in strictly rural places such cubic space shall be provided as will secure reasonable ventilation without draught. CANCER. Malignant cancerous diseases caused 89 deaths, 73 being of persons over 45 years of age. OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. Of other diseases in this class Rheumatic Fever was the cause of 16 deaths, Chronic Rheumatism and Gout of 5; and Diabetes of 7. Class V.—Developmental Diseases. From diseases of this class 162 deaths were registered, 96 being due to premature birth and atelectasis, or non-inflation of the lungs, and 66 deaths were returned as due to " old age." Class VI. .... Local Diseases. The diseases of this group were responsible for 901 deaths, or 44.7 per cent. of the total number, the following being the principal classes :— I. DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. From these there were 165 deaths, 67 being from Apoplexy, 17 from Insanity and General Paralysis of the Insane, and 27 from Convulsions. 2. — DISEASES OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. 114 deaths were ascribed to diseases of the circulatory system. 3. —DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. From these diseases, Phthisis being excluded, there were 375 deaths, or 1 5-5 per cent, of the deaths from all causes being 80 below the average of the last four years, allowing for the increase of the population. Of these 199 were ascribed to Bronchitis and 158 to Pneumonia. 4. DISEASES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM Seventeen deaths were registered in this class, 10 being due to diseases of parturition. The total number of deaths recorded as occurring within 21 days of childbirth was 19, the causes assigned being— Septic Diseases 8 Puerperal Convulsions 2 Placenta Prævia, Flooding 2 Other Accidents of Childbirth 4 Heart Disease 1 Other Diseases 2 or one death to every 219 births. 19 From the other classes of Local Diseases there were 233 deaths, viz.: — Diseases of Digestive System 161 „ Lymphatic „ 2 „ Urinary „ 51 „ Bones and Joints 6 „ Integumentary System 3 „ Organs of Special Sense 6 „ Glandlike Organs of uncertain use 1 230 Class VII. Different forms of violence caused 77 deaths. ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE. Fractures and Contusions 32 Burns 5 Poison 1 Drowning 6 Suffocation Infants in Bed 20 Otherwise 1 Otherwise 2 — 67 SUICIDE. Gunshot Wounds 2 Cut, Stab 3 Poison 3 Hanging 1 Otherwise 1 — 10 77 Class VIII.—III-Defined and Not Specified Causes. Under this heading there were 98 death?, the majority, viz., 89, being certified as due to Debility, Inanition, or Marasmus. Certification of the Causes of Death. Of the 2030 deaths registered, 1841, or 907 per cent., were duly certified by registered medical practitioners, and 182, or 9 per cent., by the Coroner after inquest, while the causes of 7, or per cent., were uncertified. Inquests. Of the 182 inquests held on parishioners, 151 were held in the parish, and 3 1 at institutions outside. The subjects were, males 115, females 67 ; and their ages— Under 5 63 5 to 60 88 Over 60 31 105 deaths were due to natural causes and 77 to violence. Those due to natural causes may be classified as follows:— Zymotic Diseases 11 Tubercular 2 Diseases of Respiratory Organs 26 Diseases of Circulatory System 28 Convulsions and other Diseases of the Nervous System 13 Alcoholism 1 Other Diseases 22 Cause not ascertained 2 105 The deaths due to violence have already been classified. Uncertified Deaths. Of the uncertified deaths, one was stated to be due to Aneurism, one to Phthisis, and the remainder to Premature Birth. Deaths in Public Institutions. FULHAM UNION INFIRMARY AND WORKHOUSE. This institution, situated in Fulham, serves for the two parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith; 427 deaths occurred in the Infirmary and 16 in the Workhouse. Of these 233 were parishioners of Fulham and 210 of persons belonging to Hammersmith. Their ages and the cause of death will be found in Table A. WESTERN FEVER HOSPITAL. 236 deaths occurred in the Western Fever Hospital, Seagrave Road. Of these 39 belonged to Fulham, and 197 to other metropolitan districts. DEATHS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT AMONG PERSONS BELONGING THERETO. The deaths of parishioners in public institutions and elsewhere outside the parish numbered 209, and occurred in the following places:— No. of Deaihs of Parishioners of Fulham. St George's Hospital 63 West London „ 28 St. Mary's „ 1 King's College „ 3 St. Thomas' „ 3 Charing Cross „ 2 Guy's „ 1 St. Bartholomew's „ 2 Middlesex „ 2 University College „ 1 North West London Hospital 1 Jubilee Hospital 3 Consumption Hospital, Brompton 11 Cancer Hospital 3 Victoria Hospital for Children 9 Hospital for Women, Chelsea 3 Hospital for Women, Euston Road 1 Queen Charlotte's Hospital 1 Cane Hill Asylum 2 Caterham „ 2 Banstead „ 5 Bethlem „ 1 Colney Hatch „ 4 Darenth „ 1 Hanwell „ 6 Ilford „ 6 Leavesden „ 4 Peckham House Hospital 1 South Western Fever Hospital 11 Fountain „ „ 6 North Western „ 3 Gore Farm „ „ 1 St. George's Infirmary 3 St. Pancras Workhouse 1 Lying House of St. John the Divine 2 Nursing Home, Clapham Common 1 Beersellers' Asylum 1 National Society for Protection of Cruelty to Children's Home 1 Elsewhere 9 209 Of the 2030 deaths registered during the year 468, or 23 per cent, took place in public institutions. The percentages in the several classes of institutions in Fulham and London were as follows:— Fulham. London. Deaths occurring in Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmary ... ... ... ... 11.6 14.3 Deaths occurring in Metropolitan Asylums and Board Hospitals ... ... ... 3-0 2-3 Deaths occurring in other Hospitals ... ... 6.8 10.4 Deaths occurring in Public Lunatic and Imbecile Asylums ... ... ... ... 1.6 2.1 Public Mortuary. 158 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows:— At the request of the Coroner 135 Brought in by the Police 19 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 4 1 58 Two of the latter being cases of infectious disease. Inquests was held on 156, and post-mortem examinations were made in 82 of the above cases. Vaccination. The following Tables, furnished by Mr. Collins, the Vaccination Officer, give the vaccination returns for 1896, and for the first six months of 1897, those for the last six months not being yet complete : — SUPPLEMENTAL RETURN FOR 1896 FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. No. of Births Registered from ist Jan., 1896, to 31st Dec., 1896. Insusceptible Of Vaccination . Removed. Had Small Pox. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Successfully Vaccinated. Outstanding. Dead. 4015 3151 - 434 18 24 34 354 RETURN OF VACCINATION FOR THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 1897, FOR THE PARISH OF FULHAM. Insusceptible of Vaccination, No. of Births Registered from 1st Jan., to 30th June, 1897. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Outstanding. Successfully Vaccinated. Had Small Pox. Removed. Dead. 2036 1618 14 - 212 61 7 124 The return for 1896 shows that 9.2 per cent, of the children remain unaccounted for as compared with 10 per cent, in 1893, 8 per cent, in 1894, and 7-4 per cent in 1895. Fulham, however, compares favourably in this respect with London as a whole, as the proportion of children not finally accounted for in it has increased from 7 per cent, in 1885 to 20.6 per cent, in 1894. Vaccination Bill. The President of the Local Government Board has introduced into the House of Commons a Bill "To amend the law with respect to Vaccination," of which the chief provisions are:— 1. —That the period within which the child must be vaccinated shall be twelve months from the birth of the child instead of three months, as at present. 2. —That the Public Vaccinator of the district shall, if required by the parent or person in charge of the child, visit the home of the child for the purpose of vaccinating the child. 3. —That if a child is not vaccinated within nine months after its birth, the Public Vaccinator shall visit the home of the child and shall offer to vaccinate the child with glycerinated calf lymph. Repeated penalties for disobedience are abolished by Section 2, which reads as follows:— " An order under Section 31 of the Vaccination Act of 1867, directing that a child shall be vaccinated shall not be made on any person who has been previously convicted of non-compliance with a similar order relating to the same child." The alteration of the age will probably lead to an increase in the number of unvaccinated children, as the Vaccination Officers will have much greater difficulty in tracing migrations from one district to another, and as it is during the last five years upwards of 18 per cent, of the children born in London have escaped vaccination. Other defects of the Bill appear to be that the administration of the Acts is not transferred from the hands of the Guardians to those of the Local Sanitary Authority, as vaccination is a sanitary measure of the first importance, and should be in charge of the same body that has charge of other sanitary measures, and that there is no reference of any sort to re-vaccination. DISINFECTION. Infected articles were disinfected by the contractor, Mr. Lacy, Town Mead Wharf, by whom they were also collected. The weight of the articles disinfected was 1,627 cwt. and the amount paid by the Vestry to Mr. Lacy was £945 17s. Bd. During the last five years the Vestry have paid for disinfecting infected articles on an average £825 a year. The Vestry have at length determined to erect a disinfecting station of their own, and the work will doubtless be commenced very shortly. SHELTER. Although it has not yet been definitely decided to provide a shelter for the use of persons during the period necessary for the disinfection of their dwellings, the Vestry will now be able to erect this on the Town Mead wharf site, where the disinfecting plant is to be placed. Water Supply. This has been satisfactorily maintained throughout the year by both the Companies, the Chelsea and West Middlesex, which supply the district, and no complaints of deficient service were received. QUALITY OF THE WATER. No samples were taken by the Vestry for analysis. Dr. Falkland's report on the Metropolitan Water Supply shows that the Thames water distributed during 1896 was on the whole of a satisfactory character and superior to that delivered during the previous year. In February, of the five Companies drawing their supplies from the Thames, the Chelsea and West Middlesex alone delivered water of fairly good chemical quality, and in March these Companies alone delivered water of satisfactory bacterial quality. House Refuse. The weekly service for the removal of house refuse has been fairly satisfactory, though some method of making up for the loss of time caused by holidays, after which complaints respecting the delay in removal are always very numerous, is still wanted. Complaints were also received respecting the accumulation of refuse in some " flats," and I strongly urged the Cartage Committee that, at any rate, during the summer months the dust should be collected from " flats" at least twice a week, as there is a large amount of refuse from these buildings, and as the receptacles are generally, of necessity, owing to the limited space, placed close to some of the windows, a nuisance is certain to be caused, unless there is frequent removal of the refuse, but the Committee resolved " that they could not depart from the usual custom." DISPOSAL OF THE REFUSE. The Vestry have finally decided to at once proceed with the erection of a Dust Destructor, and to utilise the heat generated by the cremation of the refuse for the production of electric light. NUISANCE FROM ACCUMULATION OF MANURE. Considerable difficulty was experienced during the summer in securing the regular clearance of manure from stables in the parish, the chief offenders being the London Road Car Company, against whom the Vestry took proceedings on five occasions, when penalties in all amounting to £22 9s. were inflicted. But as repeated penalties did not seem deterrent, and the nuisance from the immense accumulation of manure (especially at their stables in Farm Lane) was serious, I suggested that the Vestry should resolve to exercise its powers under Section 35 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and remove the manure themselves, recovering the expense incurred as provided by that section ; but it was decided that, as to do this a large increase in the Vestry's staff would be necessary, and it would be difficult to find means of disposing of the manure, it would be inadvisable to take this step, and that it would be better to endeavour to secure the removal of the manure by repeated prosecutions of those who failed to do this. Similar difficulties were, however, experienced by many other Metro politan Sanitary Authorities, and consequently the London County Council wrote to the Vestry, stating " that they had from time to time received complaints of nuisances arising from accumulation of manure at various premises in London, and that, under Section 36 of the Public Health Act, each Sanitary Authority is empowered to employ or contract with scavengers for collecting and removing manure and other refuse matter from any stables and cowhouses within their district, the occupiers of which signify their consent in writing to such removal, but that they were advised that the Sanitary Authority had no power to charge for their services, and were therefore considering whether it would be desirable to seek an amendment of this section in order to give the Sanitary Authority power to charge for the removal of manure w hen required by the occupier or owner similar to the section dealing with trade refuse, and that they would be glad to know whether the Vestry would be in favour of the proposed amendment of the law." The Vestry, having again considered the matter, decided to support the action of the London County Council in procuring the proposed amendment of the law. The question also came before the Vestry in connection with a complaint from the London School Board respecting the effluvia arising from the manure in some omnibus stables in Filmer Road, opposite to the Munster Road Board School. In this case there was no evidence of any accumulation, as the manure was regularly removed; but the complaint was of the smell that arose when the manure was removed, and I pointed out that this might be entirely done away with if the manure were loaded direct from the stables into covered carts, which should be removed when full, and suggested that the Vestry might be able to enforce this by availing themselves of the provisions of Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, which recites that " where any building or premises used for trade, business, process or manufacture causing effluvia, is certified to the Sanitary Authority by their Medical Officer of Health, or by any two legally qualified practitioners, or by any ten inhabitants of the district, to be a nuisance or dangerous or injurious to the health of any of the inhabitants of the district, such authority shall make a complaint, and if it appears to the Petty Sessional Court hearing the complaint that the trade, business, process or manufacture carried on by the person is a nuisance, then unless it is shown that such person has used the best practicable means for abating such nuisance, or preventing or counteracting the effluvia, the person so offending shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £50"; and as ihe Solicitor to the Yestry, to whom the question was referred, was of opinion that proceedings could be taken under this section, the Vestry resolved to do this in the future, should occasion arise. It would appear—assuming this view of the law to be correct—that the Vestry would also have power to stop the use of peat moss litter, as it is mainly when this is used —as it is now in nearly all the large stables—that any nuisance arises, the smell from peat moss manure being of a most vile description. Sewer Ventilation, The Surveyor has continued to deal vigorously with this matter, and has succeeded in obtaining permission to erect 50 shafts during the year, with the result that complaints respecting the offensive smells arising from the manholes and surface ventilators have not been quite so numerous as heretofore. NUISANCE CAUSED BY THE VENTILATORS OF THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL'S SEWERS. The Vestry's appeal against the decision of the Kensington Justices in the summons issued against the London County Council for failing to comply with the Vestry's notices requiring them to abate the nuisance caused by the emission of sewer gas from the sewer ventilators at the junction of Hartismere and Dawes Road, and in Melmoth Place, was tried by the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division, before Mr. Justice Day and Mr. Justice Lawrence, who held that the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was not intended to apply to public works belonging to a public authority and dismissed the appeal with costs. But since the case was decided the Council have erected a shaft against a house at the corner of Dawes and Hartismere Roads and closed the offensive ventilator. The question of the ventilation of sewers has been much discussed of late, all metropolitan districts having experienced the same trouble, and a Conference of the Surveyors of the various Vestries and District Boards in London was recently convened by Sir A. Binnie, Chief Engineer to the London County Council, with the view to some uniform system being adopted, if possible, for dealing with complaints of offensive emanations from gratings connected with both local and main sewers, at which the following resolutions were passed :— 1. —That the closing of sewer ventilators in response to complaints increases the general evil, the diminution of which is to be attained by the multiplication of the ventilators at regular frequent intervals. 2.—That in connection with any interceptor hereafter fixed on a main house drain it is advisable to carry up a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor, up the front side, or back of the house, to the satisfaction of the local sanitary authority, and that the outlet drain from the interceptor shall not be flap-trapped in sewer, unless required by the local sanitary authority. 3. —That pipe ventilators up buildings, or otherwise where possible, should always be adopted, in addition to surface ventilation. It will be noticed that the conclusions of the Conference practically confirm the action of the Vestry in recent years, and it is to be hoped that in future builders will carry up a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor. Combined Drainage. The existing state of the law as regards the definition of " drain " and " sewer " has, as was anticipated, involved the Vestry in a very large expenditure, as during the year 80 systems of combined drainage, embracing 240 houses which were found to be defective have been dealt with by the Vestry, who have reconstructed the " sewer" portion in each case, at a cost of upwards of £3,000. A Conference of Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, convened by the Holborn District Board of Works, at which the Vestry was represented by the Solicitor and Medical Officer of Health, held eight meetings during the year and settled a draft Bill to amend the definition clause of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, which they have presented to the London County Council with a request that they will take steps to promote the same in the next session of Parliament. It is to be feared, however, that the chances of the Bill becoming law are not great. Supervision of New Property. Attention has been frequently drawn to the inferior quality of much of the building which has taken place in Fulham, and it is satisfactory to know that of late a much more rigorous supervision of new houses has been exercised and proceedings in several instances were taken last year by the London County Council against builders in respect of contravention of the London Building Act As I have before pointed out, the Sanitary Authority have little or no control over the construction of houses, except so far as the drains are concerned, and at present the London County Council have no power to make a by-law to the effect, that a new house shall not be occupied until it has been certified by the Sanitary Authority to be in every respect fit for human habitation, but I regret that the Vestry did not think fit to adopt the recommendation made in a report on the matter that they should grant certificates, when applied for, as to the fitness of new houses for occupation, for in Fulham most of the new houses are sold by the builders on completion, and if it were known that the Vestry gave certificates respecting houses which they considered to be in all respects properly constructed and finished, intending purchasers would, in all probability, require the certificates to be produced, and in this way considerable control would indirectly be obtained over builders, and I would therefore again strongly urge the Vestry to adopt this course. As bearing out what I have said in previous reports, that " houses are being erected in Fulham in such a manner that it is almost certain that in a very few years they will be in a ruinous condition," I may mention that I have recently represented to the Sanitary Authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Act some houses which have only been built about four years, as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for habitation. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. The following houses were represented to the Sanitary Authority under the provisions of the above Act as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation:— Number of Dwellings.

The summons against the owner of 75, Burnthwaite Road for failing to comply with the Vestry's notice to relay the drains of that house was dismissed by the justices on the ground that it was not proved to their satisfaction that the drain in question was a nuisance. But I subsequently met the owner and had the drains exposed in his presence, when its undoubtedly defective condition was clearly shown and consequently he reconstructed the drains in accordance with the regulations of the Vestry. The summons against the owner of 20, Grove Avenue for failing to comply with an order of the Vestry made under Section 85 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, requiring him to disconnect the drain of 20, Grove Avenue from the sewer by means of an efficient syphon trap was dismissed on the ground that the Vestry had no power to order a structural alteration to the drains of an old house.

The fines and costs imposed amounted to £30 12s. 6d., and in a case that was dismissed the Vestry had to pay jQI is. costs. Sale of Food and Drugs Bill. A Bill has been introduced into the House of Commons by the President and Parliamentary Secretary of the Local Government Board to amend the Acts relating to the sale of food and drugs, but, as it does not give effect to some of the most important recommendations made by the Select Committee of the House of Commons which was appointed to enquire into the working of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act and the Margarine Act, it cannot be considered as likely to remedy the admittedly unsatisfactory character of the existing law, and the Vestry have adopted the following resolution, which they have ordered to be sent to the Local Government Board : — 1. That the draft Bill introduced by the President and Secretary of the Local Government Board is unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it does not embody the most important recommendations of the Food Products Adulteration Committee, and that if passed it would not lead to the removal of the difficulties experienced in carrying out the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 2. That the recommendations of the Food Products Adulteration Committee should be embodied in any Bill which may be put before Parliament during the present session. 3- That the most important recommendation of the Select Committee (viz., Recommendation No. 19), referring to the formation of a Court of Reference constituted substantially as laid down in the body of the report, should be acted upon if new legislation is to lead to satisfactory results. Bakehouses. There are 82 bakehouses in Fulham, of which 70 are underground. They have been regularly inspected during the year and been found in a fairly satisfactory condition. Slaughter-Houses. The licenses of the undermentioned slaughter-houses were renewed in October last by the County Council, no objection to the renewal being raised by the Vestry. They are but little used, the parish being mainly supplied by the dead meat trade, and have always been found well kept:— Situation. Licensee. 62, Melmoth Place K. Lowther. 603, Kings Road H. S. Jones. 61 1, Fulham Road J. Cragg. 88 and 90, High Street E. and G. Kingston. 940, Kings Road Thomas Vaughan. 105, Hammersmith Road H. Boughton Cow-Houses. The licenses of the following cow-houses were renewed by the County Council in October, the renewal of the licenses being unopposed:— Situation. Licensee. Average No. of Cows kept. 36, Burlington Road E. Evans 3 2, Haldane Road W. Pettitt 20 28, Vanstone Place R. Turvey 2 Common Lodging Houses. There is only one registered common lodging house in the parish, viz., 541, Kings Road, which is authorised to receive 51 lodgers. Two houses, viz., 16, Stamford Road and 38, Stamford Road, which were formerly registered have been removed from the list, as casual lodgers are not received at them. Houses Let in Lodgings. I regret that as yet but little has been done to carry into effect the bye-laws made by the Vestry under Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in respect of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, as only 24 houses have as yet been registered. I have on more than one occasion represented to the Vestry the necessity for enforcing these bye-laws, and have urged that a special Inspector should be appointed for this purpose; but this has not been done, and, without again going into the matter at length, I would once more strongly recommend the Vestry to adopt this course. Certificates under Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890 and 1891. Certificates for exemption from Inhabited House Duty were granted in respect of 22 houses and refused in respect of 63. Baths and Washhouses Act. Although upwards of two years have elapsed since the Vestry resolved to adopt the Baths and Washhouses Acts, nothing has yet been done to carry them into effect, though, as I have previously pointed out, they are much needed in Fulham. Sanitary Staff. The Vestry employ five Sanitary Inspectors, there being to each Inspector 3,380 houses and 2,400 inhabitants as compared with 2,500 houses and 18,700 inhabitants to each Inspector in the County of London, and 2,900 houses and 15,000 inhabitants to each Inspector in 15 of the large provincial towns, so that even with the appointment of the additional Inspector to look after the houses let in lodgings, as suggested, Fulham would still be below the rest of London as regards the number of Inspectors, and during more than half of the past year, owing to illness, the staff was reduced to four Inspectors. There is also great need for additional clerical assistance, as the Clerk is quite unable to deal with the constantly increasing work of this rapidly growing parish, and I regret that the Vestry refused to adopt the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, who had carefully considered the question, that an additional Clerk should be appointed. General Sanitary Work 1,088 complaints were received and attended to during the year, and 2,590 "intimation notices'' and 871 "statutory notices" requiring sanitary amendments were served. Great attention has continued to be paid to house drainage, and in addition to the combined systems relaid by the Vestry, the drains of 530 houses, Harwood Road Board School, the Elizabethan Schools, and the Union Infirmary were reconstructed in accordance with the notices served by the Vestry. I have pleasure in again concluding my report by expressing my opinion that all the members of the sanitary staff have endeavoured zealously and faithfully to discharge their important duties. I can testify to the interest which they take in their work, and to the thoroughness with which it is performed. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant. April 10th 1898. J.
