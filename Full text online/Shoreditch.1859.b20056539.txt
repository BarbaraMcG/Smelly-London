PROCEEDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY THE VESTRY, FOR THE REMOVAL OF NUISANCES, AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISH. THE MEDICAL OFFICER REPORTS AS FOLLOWS : The terms of the Metropolis Local Management Act, require the presentment of an Annual Report in June, bringing down the history of the operations of the Vestry to the Twenty-fifth day of March. The Registrar-General's tables refer to the usual civil year. It is therefore essential that the statistical tables of a District should deal with the like period, in order that we may compare the health-movement of the District during any given year with former years, and with that of the general population during the special year under examination. To 10 effect this, and at the same time to comply with the technical requirement of the Act, I have taken in the first quarter so as to exhibit in one view the vital statistics of the year 1859, and have then given a summary of the first quarter of 1860. This quarter may be added to the three last quarters of 1859, so as to make up the Parliamentary year. As Table II presents the mortality of the five quarters side by side, it will be easy to regard the first quarter of the current civil year by itself, or as the complement of the Parliamentary year beginning with March, 1859. The deaths of 1495 males, and 1427 females were registered during 1859; and during the same period the births of 2535 males, and 2489 females. The total mortality, 2922, presents a more favourable aspect of the health of the District than has been recorded in many previous years. 1855 1856 1857 1858 j 1859 2,998 2,719 2,955 3,183 2,922 The gross mortality during the last five years stands as follows: Looking simply at these figures, the number for 1859 must be regarded as eminently satisfactory. It is absolutely less than the figures for 1855, 1857, and 1858. But when allowance is made for increase of population, the improvement indicated is far more striking. The estimated population of 1855 was 123,000, and that of 1859, 133,000. The rate of mortality therefore, is 24 deaths annually to every 1000 persons living in 1855, and 22 to every 1000 living in 1859; or, expressed in another form, in 1855, 1 person died out of every 41 living, and in 1859, only 1 out of every 45. Or we may further say, that had the death-rate of 1855 continued to prevail in last year, there would have died, not 2922 persons but 3188. The improvement in the health of the District is therefore indicated by the saving of 266 lives in the year; and this fact may be safely taken as an index of a large amount of sickness averted. Compared with all London, and with the Eastern Division, of which Shoreditch forms a part, we find that Shoreditch fully bears its part in the general improvement. It is estimated by the Registrar-General that the deathrate of London last year was 223 per 10,000, which is slightly greater than my estimate for Shoreditch. In the Eastern Division it was 233 per 10,000, so that Shoreditch has rather gone beyond the rate of 11 improvement of that part of the Metropolis, to the conditions of which it most nearly approximates. Or, to state the comparison in another form ; if we assume the population of Shoreditch to be one-twentieth part of the Metropolitan population, the Shoreditch contingent to the death list should have been 3080 instead of only 2922. Ages at Death.—An important sanitary test, is the proportion of infant-mortality to the aggregate deaths. In the year 1858, the proportion of children dying under the age of five years was 50 per centum,—a very high one. Last year, however, there appears a remarkable improvement in this respect. 727 children died under the age of 1 year, or in the proportion of 24 per centum; and 1331 under 5 years, or 45 per centum. 554 persons survived the age of 60, being 19 per centum of the whole, Thus, the average age attained, or the gain in length of years, is marked at both the extremes of life. Mortality of the Seasons.—In Table II. we may observe that 767 deaths occurred in the first quarter, 650 in the second, 793 in the third, and 712 in the fourth. The Spring quarter is therefore far the most healthy, and the Autumn quarter the most fatal. In examining the particular causes of death, the explanation of this will more clearly appear. Causes of Death. Tables I. and II. give detailed information as to the causes of the mortality. Ranged in the order of destructiveness the different causes stand as follows : 1.—At the head of lethal causes is Phthisis, which killed 358 persons, or 12 per centum of all who died; of these, 183 died between the ages of 20 and 40. 2.—Bronchitis cut off 232 persons, and Pneumonia 163. I class these two diseases together from their similarity of nature as inflammation of the lungs, and from the frequency with which they are confounded in practice and in the death-register. It is unnecessary to say that the fatality of lung-inflammation varies with the seasons. But it is important to observe the variations in their fatality in different years and at different ages. 148 persons perished from Bronchitis and Pneumonia during the first or winter quarter, 88 during the second, only 29 during the third, and 103 in the fourth quarter. The striking influence of cold and wet in increasing the mortality, is seen by carrying the eye on to the fifth column in Table II.. where we see that in the first quarter of the present year 267 persons died of lung-inflammation, being 119 more than in the corresponding 12 quarter of 1859. It may however be remarked that the year 1859, was more favourable in respect to the fatality of this class of diseases than even 1855, 1856, or 1857. 3.—Very high in the list stand Brain-diseases. These killed 221 persons, and if we add to this figure, as may perhaps strictly be done, the deaths from Convulsions which destroyed 116 children, and Apoplexy which cut off 47 adults, we get a total of 384 deaths from affections of the nervous system. The medical statist is thus brought face to face with another proof of the ever-increasing developement of this class of diseases. To counteract this tendency, it is to be feared that the sanitary reformer has more need of the aid of moral influences, than of those powers which are limited to the modification of certain physical conditions. 4.—We find Diarrhoea which destroyed 194 persons, of whom 169 were children under the ago of five years, 166 of the deaths from this cause occurred in the autumn quarter, a season when it replaces Bronchitis and Pneumonia as the destroyer of infant life. In the 5th place, we have Scarlatina which proved fatal to 185 persons, including 116 children under five years of age. 6.—We find that under the vague terms Atrophy and Debility, there are registered 152 deaths. Here again the heaviest blow fell upon the very young. 131 of the whole were children under five years of age. 7.—Next in order, stands another group of diseases disastrous to infant life. The various forms of Scrofula destroyed 141 persons, of whom 112 were children under five years. 8.—Old Aye holds the next rank. 119 persons are recorded as having dropped off from maturity of years without specified disease. To this number might probably be added a large proportion of 100 deaths from Bronchitis in persons who had exceeded the age of 60. Congestion of the Lungs, frequently called Bronchitis, being in many cases simply a mode of dying, not a cause of death. 9.—Fever appears on the list. 108 deaths are ascribed to this cause. But the number includes 17 which occurred in St. Luke's Workhouse. Deducting these, we have 91 or less than two cases weekly occurring in Shoreditch. 10 and 11.—Small-Pox and Whoopiny-Cough each destroyed 87 persons. The mortality from these causes again fell chiefly upon the very young. 12.—Diseases of the Heart proved fatal to 84 persons. Of these, 74 had passed the age of 20. 13.—Stomach Diseases proved fatal to 70 persons. The following causes although each contributing a figure small in comparison with the foregoing are too important in themselves to be passed over without remark. 39 children prematurely born died from defective vital power. 39 persons 13 died under such circumstances that the cause of their death was not ascertained, or not certified by competent authority. I may here observe without impropriety, that however much it may be regretted that any member of the community should pass from amongst us without his death being accounted for, it must be regarded as a marvel of administrative perfection, and a title to public gratitude for the profession which renders this important service to the state gratuitously, that all the deaths should be authenticated and assigned to their immediate causes within a little more than one per centum. Lastly there is a sum of 53 persons, chiefly the subject of Coroners' inquests, who came by their death from causes other than natural disease. 5 persons died of Asphyxia, 38 from various forms of Violence, 7 from Poison, and 3 from Drowning. The Mortality in different Sub-Districts, and the proportion of Deaths to Births.—Table III exhibits a summary view of the vital statistics of the six Registration Sub-Districts. The movement of the population in different parts of the parish varies extremely. The old districts of Holywell and St. Leonard's have probably undergone little change since the census of 1851; but in the other districts the case is very different. This will be borne in mind when comparing the deaths with the population, and the proportion of deaths to births. Excluding Hoxton New Town which contains St. Luke's Workhouse, and Haggerstone West which contains Shoreditch Workhouse, we find the proportion of deaths to births ranging from a minimum of 42 per centum in Haggerstone East, to a maximum of 67 per centum in Holywell. The mean proportion of the whole parish is 58 per centum. This discrepancy is not wholly accounted for by the greater insalubrity and mortality of Holywell and St. Leonard's, but greatly by the fact that in Haggerstone East, where the erection of new houses supplies new homes for immigrants, there is a constant influx of settlers of procreative age. Thus is the proportion of births unduly raised. The proportion of deaths to births throughout London last year. was 67 per centum, which is identical with our Holywell maximum. This would lend confirmation to the estimate that the population of Shoreditch is undergoing a more rapid enlargement through immigration than the metropolis generally. The proportion in Shoreditch in 1858 was 65 per centum. 14 In order to show more distinctly the operation of different causes in different years, I have drawn up the following Table, which exhibits the mortality from ten principal diseases in each of the last five years : principal diseases. 1855 1856 1857 1868 1859 Tubercular Diseases (including Phthisis) 526 460 542 498 499 189 191 243 295 232 Pneumonia - 256 235 235 213 163 Fever 153 225 184 135 108 Scarlatina 138 111 109 188 185 Diarrhoea 112 107 146 143 194 Brain Disease 155 194 186 221 221 Convulsions 107 102 107 135 116 Diseases of Heart and Blood Vessels 75 81 79 69 84 Small-Pox 53 13 7 20 87 This Table informs us that Tubercular diseases made no advance upon the previous year, that Bronchitis and Pneumonia were much less fatal; tbat Fever, the chief sanitary test, is progressively diminishing year by year, exhibiting a most encouraging sequence; that Scarlatina, although it has prevailed extensively, was not quite so fatal as in the preceding year; that Diarrhoea was more fatal; that Brain-diseases were equally fatal; and that Small-Pox, destroyed 67 persons more than in 1858, and 34 more than in 1855, the year of a previous epidemic. With the exception of Small-Pox, a subject to which I shall presently advert more particularly, this Table gives satisfactory evidence of the progress of sanitary amelioration. Much must however be ascribed to the favourable meteorological influences of the year. The influence of temperature was especially remarkable. The cold of winter causes an excess of mortality by causing inflammation of the lungs; and the inordinate heat of summer, by giving rise to diarrhoea. But usually, long continued cold destroys more persons than the short heats of summer. The mean temperature last year was nearly 51°. There were but four weeks, namely the two first in the year, and the fiftieth and fifty-first, which were marked 15 by excessive cold. Cold does not generally kill immediately, but the diseases it produces, mostly only terminate fatally after the lapse of several days. Hence the effects of the cold weeks at the beginning and end of the year, are seen in the mortality tables of the ensuing weeks. The deaths from the cold of January will thus be recorded in the year; whilst the deaths from the cold of the end of December, will swell the mortality of the first quarter of 1860. Thus it is that cold has left such light traces of its depressing influence on the records of 1859. On the other hand, the extreme heat of July produced an excess of deaths from Diarrhoea, but not enough to neutralise the saving of life due to the mildness of the winter months. Prevalence of Sickness.—Table IV. presents a summary view of the new cases of sickness which came under the care of the Medical Officers of the Board of Guardians during the year 1859. These comprise a total of 10,073 eases. Many of course are re-entries, and refer to the same persons coming on the books more than once during the year. During the preceding year (1858) the gross number was 12,538. A dimunition in the number of applications for Poor Law Medical Relief so marked, undoubtedly confirms the indications drawn from the mortality tables as to the improvement in the health of the district. But many causes concur to render this an imperfect test. With regard to particular diseases, we observe that 402 cases of Small Pox were treated; 266 cases of Scarlatina ; 875 cases of Diarrhoea; 1615 cases of Fever ; 1067 cases of Lung Disease ; 498 cases of Skin Disease ; and 180 Accidents. With reference to Fever cases, it is to be remembered that in the sickness returns the word "Fevers" and "Febrile" are necessarily used as indefinite terms to embrace a large number of cases which have no relation to Fever properly so-called. This remark does not apply to an equal extent to the mortality returns. The Thames-Theory of Disease.—As experience has now done ample justice to the theory that the Thames was a source of disease, I need do no more than advert to the subject very briefly. The theory never had a foundation in sound medical science or skilled observation. It was the offspring of unreasoning alarm. Since the date when I first, in my reports to your body, challenged the advocates of this theory to produce the evidence on which they founded their creed, the most competent 16 witnesses have unanimously borne testimony to the accuracy of my conclusions. The stubborn testimony of facts Has confirmed those conclusions. And the public mind is at length reassured by the non-realisation of the prophesied decimation of the metropolis by cholera, and by the great fact that the health of London has been steadily improving notwithstanding the deterioration of the river. In my Report for the week ending 4th June, I called attention to what was then passing. The average temperature of the air was 4.°0 higher than in previous years ; the temperature of the water in the river exceeded 60° ; and for some past at low water the Thames had been exceedingly offensive. Notwithstanding all this, the public health was improving, Fever diminishing, and Diarrhoea not appearing in the mortality returns. There were two reasons why, enjoying peculiar opportunities for arriving at a correct opinion, I thought it my duty to urge upon you in 1856, and subsequently, the utter fallacy of what I may now call the great Thames-delusion. If we ignore the true cause of a disease we shall be likely to neglect the proper remedy and to apply a wrong one. Thus assuming that the emanations from the Thames were the main cause of disease, it was proposed to divert the sewage from the metropolitan part of the river, by constructing the Main Drainage System. This scheme, although open to serious financial and engineering objections, and involving the partial, if not total, waste of the sewage for agricultural purposes, was resolved upon as a paramount sanitary necessity. Now, whatever other recommendations the scheme might have, I felt assured that the anticipation of benefit to the public health was false, and that no justification on this ground could be pleaded for the enormous cost and inconvenience it must entail. In the next place, while mens' minds were rivetted upon the Thames as the source of sickness, due attention could not be expected to be given to those measures of local and personal hygiene by which the improvement of the common health is chiefly to be promoted. It may be remembered that in several Vestries, resolutions were actually moved with the view of averting the construction of sewers. It was thought by many persons of influence to be better to live in the midst of overflowing cesspools than to add to the defilement of the river. Happily this idea never prevailed in Shoreditch. Great sewerage works have been carried out. Multitudes of cesspools have been abolished, and striking has been the improvement in the salubrity of the district. 17 I am however far from contending that no pains should be taken to abate the nuisance arising.from the stench emitted by the Thames in dry seasons. The ultimate remedy relied upon is the interception of the Sewage by the Main Drainage Scheme. Pending the completion of that work, it has been felt necessary to endeavour to diminish or to destroy the putrefactive properties of the sewage that must still be thrown into the river. I believe that the means employed last year were to some extent successful in deodorising the Sewage, and thus, in lessening the offensiveness of the river. This year, experiments have been instituted into the view of effecting a more complete deodorisation. I do not enter with the discussion concerning the relative merits of the different agents employed or proposed. Under present arrangements the Vestries and District Boards are simply called upon to pay for what others may determine to adopt. By the plan adopted nothing seems contemplated beyond the purification of the river. The operation upon the sewage is therefore limited to the points of discharge. The Sewage above these points, throughout its miles of currents, is left to putrefy and distil its noxious gases into the air and into our houses, through gulleys, ventilating-shafts and housedrains. This is a far more serious practical evil than the offensiveness of the Thames. It is obviously one with which you, as guardians of the health of Shoreditch, are more immediately concerned. I can refer to several deaths from Scarlatina which there is the strongest evidence for concluding, were due to the exposure to the concentrated emanations from gulleys. Can this be remedied ? I believe it may. The deodorisation of the Main Sewers ought to be extended to the principal branches. If a few stations were established nearer the periphery of the sewage-system, two beneficial effects would result: first, the fermentation and escape of poisonous gases from the sewers at numerous points in the midst of our habitations would be greatly prevented ; secondly, the sewage thus partially purified would reach the deodorising stations of the Metropolitan Board of Works near the river, in such a state as to require much less treatment. The primary local requirements of the inhabitants living over the sewers, and the secondary general requirements of the Metropolis would be equally met. 18 1 will conclude these observations with one remark as to the supposed connection between the Thames and Cholera. It has been hotly contended that the state of the river was itself capable of generating Cholera ; and a fortiori, the disease once apparent on the stream, it would propagate itself and spread with fearful rapidity from this congenial focus. Now I call attention to the fact that last year, during the heats of July when the river was extremely offensive, three several times was Cholera in a virulent form imported from Hamburgh. The cases were admitted under my care on board the Dreadnought. There the disease stopped. The conditions necessary for its propagation were not there. Small-Pox.—The universal prevalence of Small-Pox in an epidemic form not only in this District, but over the Metropolis and many parts of the country, is a circumstance that calls for the more serious attention because it is, owing to the discovery of vaccination, the most preventible of diseases. We have seen that 87 persons died of Small-Pox during the year, and that 402 cases of this disease came under the Poor Law Medical Officers. To the 87 deaths must be added several more which occurred in the Small Pox Hospital. In many instances it is specially recorded that the victims had not been vaccinated; in the majority of the remainder I have no hesitation in saying that if vaccinated at all, the vaccine disease had not been fully produced. The 402 cases reported are far from representing the extent to which the disease has prevailed. The great majority of these cases occurred in vaccinated persons ; and the disease was much modified in severity in consequence. Under this partial protection the deaths are not in so large a proportion as 1 in 4. Many of the deaths occurred in private practice, so also certainly did a corresponding number of cases of Small-Pox which recovered; without pretending to precision, I think we may safely estimate the number of inhabitants of all classes who took the Small-Pox during the recent epidemic was more than 1000. From this we may form some feeble idea of the ravages that this loathsome disease would have created had its contagiousness and virulence not been checked by general vaccination. It is in the highest degree probable that many hundreds if not thousands, would have perished. But no consideration of thankfulness for escape from greater evils ought to sway us to neglect the lesson of prudence conveyed in the actual loss we hear endured. It is our duty to carry the protection afforded by vaccination to the utmost extent. 19 The subject has naturally excited considerable professional and public interest ; and it is gratifying to observe that there exists a general disposition to amend the legislative and administrative measures relating to Small-Pox and Vaccination. How best to do this is a question upon which I submit that the practical experience and observation of the Medical Officers of Health and the Public Vaccinators must be of the greatest value. The figures collected by the Poor Law Board, and relied upon as the basis of legislation by the Privy Council, are figures and little more. They lead to conclusions at variance with direct observation. Thus in the following table we have the official returns for Shoreditch of the number of Registered Births and Vaccinations during the years specified.— Vaccinations. Births. Proportion. September 29th, 1854, to September 29th, 1855 2812 4542 62 „ „ 1855, „ „ 1856 3094 4748 65 „ ,, 1856, ,, „ 1857 3280 4869 69 „ 1857, „ „ 1858 3022 4922 60 „ „ 1858, „ „ 1859 2502 4973 50 From this it might be inferred that last year one half only of the children born were vaccinated. But this is very far from being true. I have on former occasions pointed out, that this table bears the following fallacies. 1. The registered births are not all the births. 2. Many children die under three months old and thus cannot be vaccinated. 3. The vaccinations performed by private practitioners are not registered. 4. A considerable proportion of the registered vaccinations relate to children above one year old and therefore do not refer to the births of the year. To determine the proportion of children not vaccinated other means must be employed. I believe that nothing short of individual inspection by medical men will accomplish the object. No reliance can be placed upon general inquiries. 20 The table before you, however, justifies an important conclusion. It is not a little remarkable that the proportion of registered vaccinations to births should have risen from G2 per cent. in 1855 to 69 per cent. in 1857, and that it should have fallen to 60 per cent. in 1858 and so low as 50 per cent. in 1859. Has Vaccination really been less extensively performed during the last two years ? I fear that the answer must be in the affirmative. Great pains have been taken to give the utmost effect to the imperfect powers at command. The hand-bill printed in the appendix was posted up in conspicuous places, and copies circulated in courts and houses where Small-Pox had occurred, and letters were addressed to the clergy inviting their aid and influence in carrying out the objects of the circular. House-to-house visitations were made by myself and the Inspectors in addition to very many scattered inspections of houses where the disease had appeared. Much personal influence was also exerted by the public Vaccinators. The following summary of the result of inspections of two of the Parochial Schools, conveys I believe moro accurate information than can be obtained in other ways. The children found to be not vaccinated, or in my judgment not protected by the vaccination they had undergone, were vaccinated on the spot by the assistant of the Public Vaccinator. I considered this measure to be necessary not only for the primary purposo of protecting the children, but also for that of arriving at a complete series of observations that might serve as a reliable basis for estimating the extent of non-vaccination, and of the number of persons who arc reposing in false security on the faith of vaccinations that have failed. Result of Inspection of Two Schools with reference to Protection from Small-Pox. Children. Had SmallPox. Vaccinated. Not Vaccinated Result or Vaccination. Scars Good. Scars Bad. Full. Modified None. No return 264 8 104 56 30 49 33 8 5 21 From this it appears that scarcely more than 6 children out of 10 were fully protected against Small-Pox, although 2 more out of every 10 had been vaccinated sufficiently to leave imperfect scars. 2 out of every 10 were exposed to the full risk of contagion, and the uncontrolled malignity of the disease. The result of this inspection was further put to the test of vaccinating those children who appeared to need protection, so as to embrace all the conditions of a complete medical observation. 95 children were vaccinated. The result was that no less than 49 or more than half took the vaccine disease fully ; 33 in a modified degree ; whilst 8 only shewed no effect. This double examination by inspection and vaccination speaks in unmistakeable language ; the result far exceeded anything I was prepared to expect. The general result of investigation by inspection alone made by Medical Officers of Health in Schools in other parts of the Metropolis is to shew that 10 per cent. of the children are not vaccinated. Tested by vaccination, we find that 30 per cent. are unprotected. The conclusions indicated by this experiment are of the highest practical importance. It follows that the measures contemplated for increasing the efficiency of the Compulsory Vaccination Act, and the orders of the Privy Council for ensuring special instruction in vaccination are inadequate to meet the emergency. The following are among the many difficulties to be encountered. 1—.There can be no doubt that in many cases the protective power of the vaccine disease wears out with time and requires to be renewed. 2.—It also happens that parents neglect to afford the Vaccinator an opportunity of verifying by inspection at the proper date after the operation, its success. They rest in the perfect assurance that their children are safe because their arms have been punctured, whilst in its essential conditions the operation may have failed. Thus in the School inspections now referred to, children actually brought to me certificates of successful vaccination from an institution in Finsbury, who nevertheless showed none of the characteristic signs. There were others in the same case whose friends assured me they had been vaccinated. In this manner a large indefinite number of persons are yearly added to the unprotected class. 22 3. I have become acquainted with serious irregularities in the mode of vaccination in a neighbouring parish, which I mention here because the subject we are discussing is of universal interest, and because neglect in one section of the community affects the safety of the rest. I am informed that there are druggists who vaccinate extensively ; and that the vaccinations, they perform, if certified at all, are certified by others who, in many instances, have no personal knowledge of the cases. In this and other ways, a vast amount of defective vaccination exists, which is the source of great danger to the community. Some machinery for ensuring re-vaccination is necessary. 4. In Ireland there is as yet no Registration Act; in Scotland the Registration Act has been only a few years in operation ; and in both these parts of the empire the provisions for extending vaccination are more defective than even in England. Owing to the continual migrations taking place between all parts of the country, un-vaccinated persons frequently settle in London. This is a source of danger against which it is very difficult to guard. These persons quite escape the ordinary provisions. As an instance I may cite a case in which the parents of a child two years old were summoned before a Justice for refusing to have it vaccinated. The Justice objected to take an information because the time (three or four months after birth) had elapsed. Inspection of Schools and other places where young people are congregated should be performed systematically. The following suggestions for securing more complete vaccination were embodied in a Special Report presented by me to your Parliamentary Committee. 1. That the Registration of the Births of all children be made compulsory. 2. That the parents or guardians of all children vaccinated by private medical attendants be made answerable for the return of a certificate of vaccination to the Registrar of the District in which the children are born. 23 3. That the Registrars be required every month to furnish to the Public Vaccinators a list of those children who have attained the age of four months and concerning whom no Certificate of Vaccination has been returned. That the Medical Officer of Health be empowered to inspect these lists. 4. That the Public Vaccinators be required to visit the parents or guardians of children thus indicated to them by the Registrars, for the purpose of vaccinating such children. That the Public Vaccinator shall make a return to the Registrar specifying the cases in which he shall have performed vaccination ; also the cases in which vaccination was not carried out, and the reason why it was not. 5. That the Registrars be instructed to apply for a summons against those parents or guardians who may be returned by the Public Vaccinators as having refused to allow the children under their care to be vaccinated. 6. That the Registrars be instructed to proceed in like manner against those persons who being of age refuse to be vaccinated, or who being parents or guardians refuse to allow children under their care, irrespective of the age of such children, to be vaccinated; and whose names may be returned by the Medical Officers of Health, Poor-Law Surgeons, or Public Vaccinator, or other Registered Medical Practitioner. 7. That the Medical Officer of Health, where one is appointed, or the Public Vaccinators where there is no Medical Officer of Health, shall be empowered once or oftener in every year to visit every school, public or private, in his district, for the purpose of determining what children require to be vaccinated. That in such visits the Medical Officer of Health shall, in the case of Public Schools, be accompanied by the Public Vaccinator, who shall vaccinate the unprotected children at the time of visitation or as soon after as convenient. That in the case of Private Schools, the Medical Officer of Health or Public Vaccinator be accompanied by a registered medical practitioner indicated by the master or other authority of the school, if desired ; and that the practitioner so designated shall vaccinate the children requiring protection. That in all cases the practitioner who performs the vaaccination shall be required to make the usual returns to the Registrars. 24 8 That every registered medical practitioner be entitled to receive a minimum fee for every certificate of successful vaccination forwarded to the Registrars. 9. That the certifying practitioner shall in no case certify the result of a vaccination as "successful" or "unsuccessful" unless such result shall have been actually ascertained by his personal inspection. Church Vaults.—I am now able to report the final closure of the burial-vaults under the three Churches of St. Leonard, St. John's, Hoxton, and St. James,' Curtain Road. The work has been done under an order bearing date 6th June, 1859, from the Privy Council, under my superintendence. In all the vaults the coffins have been disposed on a level covered with fresh mould to a depth of at least one foot, the interstices being well filled in; over this there is a layer of two or three inches of small wood-charcoal; and in the case of two vaults in St. John's, I felt it desirable as a complete precaution to add a layer of gravel to ensure compactness. In the public vaults of the Old Church there are thus covered 202 coffins „ St. John's „ 46 „ „ St. James' „ 20 „ Total 268 previously to covering in the coffins Mr. Churchwarden Jackson gave ample opportunity for the removal of the bodies by relations. In some instances this was taken advantage of. As the works for the new drain in Old Street Road, were proceeding at the time, and I was able to approve of the screened earth yielded, abundance of material was procured at very small cost. I have certified that the work has been completed in a satisfactory manner. Sanitary Accommodation in Churches.—In the case of a new church being built at Haggerstone considerable opposition was made by the architect to the requirement urged by your Chief Surveyor and myself, to provide water-closets for the accommodation of the congregation. The architect who had been largely engaged in the erection of churches 25 denied the necessity of this accommodation, and the power of the Vestry to enforce its provision. When it is remembered that on particular occasions people come from long distances, and that on Sundays the usual resources for relief are closed, the inconvenience that may result from the absence of this provision must be obvious. But I may add that cases of severe and permanent disease, as well as of much temporary distress have come under my observation which have arisen from this cause. Ultimately the accommodation required was provided. I refer to the circumstance here, because I know that in many places of worship this matter is neglected. Slaughter-Houses.—The powers of sanitary controul over Slaughterhouses conferred upon the Vestry continue to work beneficially for the public, and also for the butchers. The Vestry has memorialized the Metropolitan Board of Works in favour of the introduction into the Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment Bill, of a clause for conferring similar powers over Cow-houses. A clause to this effect is in the Bill now before Parliament. Pump-Waters considerered as to fitness for drinking.—In consequence of the application made to the Vestry by the Free Drinking Fountains Association for leave to erect fountains in the Parish of Shoreditch to be supplied from the mains of the water companies, your Committee referred it to me to report as to the fitness for drinking of the water of the shallow springs as drawn up by the various public pumps. I have selected two pumps as fairly representing the quality of the water from this source. These are, the pump opposite Shoreditch Church, and the new one erected under the superintendence of your Surveyor in Murray Street. The following is the result of the chemical analysis: The quantities represent grains per imperial gallon. Church Pump. Murray Street Pump. Organic matter 7.84 11.68 Mineral matter 96.32 97.28 Total impurities 104.16 108.96 26 It would appear from this that the impurity of the Church pump is less than in 1856. Although the organic and mineral admixture ranges from four to five times more than is found in the Companies' waters, it is still a matter for congratulation that the impurity of the spring waters is so small in amount. If this impurity were not liable to fluctuation both in quantity and quality, and to exceed the proportions found on this occasion, I might not be disposed to condemn the use of these spring-waters for drinking purposes. It is the absence of all security against their contamination, more especially from fcecal excrement, that renders it unsafe to resort to them habitually. Although it was not the case with the particular specimens last examined, I have hardly ever exposed a sample of town spring-water to the heat of a summer-day for some hours, without observing it to become putrid. There are also facts connected with shallow-well waters which it is impossible for a medical man not to regard without serious apprehension. There are various diseases which there is much reason to conclude may be directly propagated by swallowing matter which has been evacuated from the intestines of human or other animal beings. These matters are easily conveyed in water; and some at least are not likely to be decomposed or destroyed by filtration through gravel or other soil. The evidence that cholera may be propagated in this manner is very strong. A very able physician, Dr. William Budd of Bristol, has recently adduced arguments and facts to prove that Typhoid Fever is so propagated; and that Tape-worm and other parasites that infest the human intestines are so propagated, is now proved beyond doubt amongst naturalists and physicians. Having given the subject the best consideration, I am unable to arrive at any other conclusion than that the shallow spring-waters of the district are unsafe to drink. I have therefore no hesitation in recommending that the proposition of the Association for establishing Free Drinking Fountains to be supplied from the mains of the water companies be agreed to. The annual cost of the water would be small compared with the great benefits that would result. TABLE I. Mortality-Returns of Shoreditch for the Year ending Saturday, 31st day of December, 1859.

LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. PUBLIC NOTICE concerning SMALL-POX AND VACCINATION. Sanitary Department, 37, Hoxton Square, 24th June, 1859. 1. The Vestry having had its attention directed to the great prevalence of Small-Pox in the Parish, has deemed it advisable to make known to the inhabitants, the provisions now in force relative to Small-Pox and Vaccination. As these provisions have been enacted for the common safety against a highly contagious and dangerous disease, it concerns every one to aid in carrying them out. Penalty against Inoculation or exposure of persons affected with Small-Pox II. By clause VIII of the 3rd and 4th Vict., cap. 29, Any Person who shall wilfully by any means whatsoever produce the disease of Small-Pox shall be liable to be proceeded against summarily, and shall upon conviction be imprisoned in the common Gaol or House of Correction, for any term not exceeding One Month. Vaccination. III. By Clauses II, III, IV, of the 16th & 17th Vict., cap. 100., parents and guardians of children are required to have them Vaccinated within three months of birth; and to take the children on the eighth day following the day on which Vaccination has been performed to the Surgeon, in order that he may be able to certify that the Vaccination has properly taken or otherwise. Penalty for neglecting Vaccination IV. By Clause IX, of the same Act, the Registrar is directed to give to the parents or guardians of children, within seven days after the registration of birth, a notice enjoining them to take the children to be Vaccinated; and if this notice be neglected the parents or guardians shall forfeit a sum not exceeding twenty shillings. V. The illness of a child is not held sufficient ground for neglecting or deferring Vaccination, unless it be certified by a medical practitioner that the child is in an unfit state to be Vaccinated; and the certificate to that effect is to be renewed every two months until the medical practitioner shall be of opinion that Vaccination may safely and properly be performed. Re—Vaccination VI. It being proved that in most cases where Small-Pox has occurred after Vaccination, the Cow-Pox had, from various causes, not taken fully, it is desirable to submit the marks of Vaccination to a medical practitioner with a view to Re-Vaccination where the protection may be considered insufficient. Disabilities attending NonVaccination VII. No person is allowed to Emigrate under the provisions of the Emigratio??? Commissioners to a British Colony, unless it be certified by a medica??? practitioner that he has been duly Vaccinated or has had the Small-Pox In many Public Schools and other establishments a similar rule ??? observed. The neglect of Vaccination may also in other ways interfer??? with a person's employment or advancement in life. VIII. All persons are therefore hereby cautioned as to the penalties incurred by neglect of Vaccination; and are earnestly exhorted to immediately tak??? all un-vaccinated children in their care, to the Surgeon appointed ???

Signed by Order of the Vestry, ROBERT BARNES, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. The Medical Officer of Health for Shoreditch. 27 The Parish has been divided into Two Districts, called the East and West, and an Inspector of Nuisances has been appointed for each District. The Inspector of the West Division Reports as follows: I beg to submit the following summary of proceedings taken for the removal of Nuisances, and the Sanitary improvement of the West Division of the parish, for the year ending 25th March, 1860. I have inspected 2097 houses and reported upon such of them as required special attention; 376 Cesspools have been emptied and filled up; 500 water closets have been erected, properly trapped and drained to the sewers, in the place of open privies; 139 house drains have been cleansed and repaired; dust bins have been provided for 48 houses, and additional windows have been put into 4 houses to improve the ventilation. A considerable portion of these improvements have been made in Long Alley and a number of the adjoining Courts, a locality which more than any other of my district requires particular sanitary attention; here 56 cesspools have been abolished, and 87 proper water closets constructed with drains to the sewers having all the inlets properly trapped. I attach more than usual importance to these, because from the close contiguity of the houses, the smallness of the yards, and the consequent near proximity to the doors and windows, of the privies and cesspools, the air was continually polluted with noxious effluvia. The alterations now made will enable the inhabitants to breathe a purer atmosphere, and thus contribute both to their comfort, and to their health. In 12 houses, where the under-ground kitchens not possessing the legal requsites were occupied as separate dwellings, contrary to the provisions of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," notices were given to the owners that such occupation should be discontinued, and the occupiers have all been removed. I have received complaints that Pigs were kept in 6 places where they were a nuisance and injurious to health, notices-were given to the 28 owners of the premises requiring their removal, which was accordingly effected. In two cases I had to summon parties before the Magistrate at Worship Street, one for causing an obstruction by placing timber on the pavement, and refusing to remove it when required; the other for refusing or neglecting to comply with a notice to abate a Nuisance caused by a privy and cesspool; in both the Magistrate decided against the parties, and ordered them to do what was required. During the year, I made three periodical inspections of all the Licensed Slaughter-Houses and on each occasion found them in a satisfactory condition; they are 49 in number and are well drained, paved, and ventilated, and have a plentiful supply of water for cleansing purposes; they are all lime washed three or four times a year, and some of them where the business is large, more frequently, no complaints have been made respecting any of them. I have also to report that the roads and streets have been regularly and efficiently cleansed; and notwithstanding a protracted winter with long continuance of wet weather the Contractor was always ready with necessary force, to have the sweepings, mud and refuse removed within reasonable time. During the year I received 340 applications to have dust removed, these were duly forwarded to the Contractor and promptly attended to. It may be interesting to those who have not seen previous reports, to present at one view the entire number of sanitary improvements effected since the establishment of the Vestry in 1856. In the West Division 1172 cesspools have been emptied and filled up; 1521 water closets have been erected, with proper drains to the sewers; 519 house drains have been cleansed and repaired, and an efficient drainage provided for 2040 houses. Dust bins have been erected for 232 houses, and additional windows have been put into 57 to improve the ventilation. All these works have been executed by and at the expense of the owners, and from their character cannot fail to tell favourably upon the general health. 29 The Inspector or the East Division Reports as follows: In accordance with custom I beg to lay before you the following summary of works for the sanitary improvement of the East Division of the parish, which have been performed during the 12 months preceding the 25th March, 1860. First, that during that period, I have had occasion to inspect 2054 houses, mostly occupied by the poorer class, in the various densely populated and over crowded courts and alleys of your parish, in many places where disease and distress work together hand-in-hand, and as one instance, little known by the more affluent part of our inhabitants, I would state that during the months of April, May, and June, I made a houseto-house visitation of 307 houses, in which it was reported that Small-Pox and Scarlet Fever was raging to a fearful extent, and found that in many cases thorough cleansing was necessary, which was ordered and done. In these 307 houses I found 1228 rooms, occupied by 435 families in sickness and misery, numbering 1658 persons, of whom 755 were adults, and 903 children, and at the time of visiting their rooms I found 54 with the Small-Pox on them, or were just recovering from it, and that 28 had died. That during the year. I have caused 530 house drains to be cleansed and repaired, and in many cases new pipe drains to be substituted for the old imperfect brick or tile drains. » That 210 cesspools have been cleansed and abolished by being filled up with dry rubbish, the existing drains communicating with the Sewers or drains leading to sewers put in order, in connexion wherewith 308 Water Closets provided with all the necessary apparatus of pans, traps &c., have been fixed instead of the old open privies. That in 84 instances, I have caused the paving of the back-yards near the inlets to the drains to be taken up and relaid, stink traps provided, and the drainage of the houses improved, thus making a total of 614. That I have had complaints of Swine being kept in 27 places, and caused their removal where they were in close confined situations, or so 30 near to dwellings as to be offensive, and considered injurious to the health of the inhabitants. That I have made three periodical examinations of the 44 Licensed Slaughter-houses within my District, and in very few instances have had occasion to call on the owners to have them cleansed and lime whited which has been immediately attended to. That in three other instances only, have I been obliged to insist on the opening of back windows to improve the ventilation, and find the owners of property very ready to adopt any suggestion to improve the sanitary conditions of the neighbourhood. That the Dusting and Scavengers work throughout the East District has been very efficiently done by your Contractor, notwithstanding the long continuance of unfavourable weather, and the complaints made to him have been promptly attended to. And that in 37 cases, New dust bins have been provided, or others put in order. And as to obstructions of the footways, I have after repeatedly cautioning the various shopkeepers to remove their goods from the public way, served on them 97 notices, which in most cases have had the desired effect, and the thoroughfare of our streets have been improved.
