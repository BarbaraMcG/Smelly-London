Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP, M.R.San.I. Chief Sanitary Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health FOR THE YEAR 1955 BY C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S. (Eng.), L.R.C.P. (Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF W. K. PICKUP , M.R.San.I. Chief Sanitary Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1955. To the Chairman and Members of the East Bar net Urban District Council I have the honour to present my report for the year 1955. Attention is drawn firstly to the Analysis of Vital Statistics immediately following the Table. Once again allowing for the curious results produced by small variations in certain instances where the essential numbers are themselves small, the striking point is (with two exceptions to be mentioned) the very great similiarity in the statistics of the area from year to year. 1955 was a 'Measles' year—otherwise the infectious diseases totals show little variation. The new cases of Tuberculosis once again show a very satisfactory decline, and with the slow but steady improvement in the housing situation, coupled with greatly improved surgical and medical treatment of established cases and consequent decrease of infectivity, one can with some confidence expect this fall in numbers to continue. Here I would like to pay tribute to the Housing Committee for the sympathetic manner in which they have dealt with my requests for preferential treatment in re-housing of Tuberculous families. 3 In the majority of the cases where improved housing conditions are considered necessary for the limitation of the spread of infection appropriate action has been taken within a reasonable period of time. Once again an appeal is made for prompt notifications of infectious diseases. Avoidable embarrassment is still being caused on occasions by the delay in information being given to the Public Health Department. The department was busily engaged in the early part of the year in completing a full housing survey for the Council, and the first Clearance Area (Albert Road) for many years was declared by the Council. We may look forward to several years of activity in housing matters, but at last a clear picture of the needs of the area has evolved. This work is fully detailed in the Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report and is certain to retain high priority over the next few years. In the meantime the other routine works of the department have not lessened in any respect—in particular no effort has been spared to enforce food hygiene, in which food retailers in the district have co-operated. The sampling methods have proved very satisfactory and have resulted in action in several cases. With regard to Rodent Control, it would still appear that no diminution of effort can be permitted if the infestation is to be kept at a reasonable level. Finally the usual, but none the less sincere thanks to all members of my staff for their untiring work during the past year—and also to the Chief Officers and staff of other departments of the Council for their ever ready help and co-operation. C. M. SCOTT, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area and Rateable Value Area (in acres) 2,644 Registrar General's estimate of population (1955) 40,710 Number of inhabited houses (rated) 12,055 Number of persons per house 3.4 Rateable value (at 31st December, 1955) £418,283 Product of penny rate £1,696 Number of business premises 734 Number of industrial premises 36 Vital Statistics Live births— Male Female Total Legitimate 236 243 479 Illegitimate 9 16 25 Total 245 259 504 Still births— Legitimate 1 7 8 Illegitimate 1 — 1 Total 2 7 9 Deaths of infants under 1 year of age— Legitimate 7 2 9 illegitimate — 1 1 Total 7 3 10 Deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age— Legitimate 5 1 6 Illegitimate — 1 1 Total 5 2 7 Total number of deaths of all ages 179 211 390 5 Births 1954 1955 Live births (rates per 1,000 population) 12.9 13.0 Still births (rates per 1,000 population) 0.23 0.23 Still births (rates per 1,000 total; live and still births) 18.5 18.4 Deaths Infants under 1 year of age (rate per 1,000 live births) 10.5 21.0 Total all ages (rate per 1,000 population) 10.1 10.2 The Registrar General's Comparability Factors for Births and Deaths have been taken into account when calculating the above rates.

Totals 10 7 2 1 4 1 — — 8 ANALYSIS OF VITAL STATISTICS 1. The Registrar General's mid-year estimate of population for 1955 is 40,710. This shows a slight decrease on the previous year, the actual figure being 20. This decrease is so slight that for all practical purposes it can be ignored. 2. The number of live births during the year is 504 which is 2 higher than the previous year. The birth rate is 13 per thousand of the population which reflects the increase of 2 and the decrease of population by giving a rise on 1954 of 0.1. 3. Infantile mortality rate is 21 per thousand live births which shows an increase of twice that of the previous year. This figure of 21 is, however, comparable to the figure of 1953 and other preceding years. The figure for 1954 was an exceptionally low figure which occurs from time to time and seems to have no significance. The death rate for illegitimate infants for the year is 40 per thousand illegitimate births. There is a great variation on this figure from year to year as the figures involved are so small. This statistic as it deals with such small figures has no practical use. The death rate of the year to which this report refers is 10.2. The number of deaths during the year was 390 as compared with 389 on the previous year. This figure keeps very constant from year to year. 4. The number of deaths from Cancer is 78 which is only 2 more than the previous year. As may be seen from Table II they are mainly in the higher age groups, which is normal. 5. There were 20 new cases of Tuberculosis during the year which is very considerably lower than the number of new cases in 1954. The number of new cases have over the last three years shown a considerable decrease. It is to be hoped this decrease will continue. The number of Tuberculosis deaths was 5 which shows a slight decrease on 1954. There is definitely a decrease on Tuberculosis deaths over the last few years. 6. Infectious Diseases during the year show an increase of more than 50 per cent. over the previous year. However, it will be remembered that in 1954 only 15 cases of Measles were shown. In Table I lor 1955 494 cases of Measles are shown, which is a more reasonable figure. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever are considerably less, whilst Chicken Pox and Whooping Cough remain practically constant. The age group from 4.10 as usual contains the greatest number of cases of Infectious Diseases. The Sanitary Inspectors have continued with the practice of visiting all cases of Scarlet Fever, Poliomyelitis and Food Poisoning 9 and as may be seen from Table I in the Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report the number of visits paid to Infectious Diseases reflects the reduction in the number of cases of the above stated diseases. Water The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date chemical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,754 examinations of water representative of supply were made, 99.5 per cent. being B. coli free in 100 ml. Ten samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination to the Public Health laboratory. The reports were in every case satisfactory. 10 East Barnet Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1955 To the Chairman and Members of the East Bar net Urban District Council I have the honour to present my fourth report to the Council. The number of visits made during the year remained approximately at the same level as the previous year. The Housing Survey was completed in June and one of the two additional staff left when the work was finished. As the work of the department has increased considerably more than is reflected in the number of visits it was found necessary to retain the other temporary officer to assist with the housing problem. The Council's programme for Clearance and Demolition in the next five years was shown in the return made to the Minister under Section 1 of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) Act, 1954, and by division shows that on the average 30 houses in Clearance Areas and 4 individual unfits have to be dealt with year by year. As part of this programme 23 houses in Albert Road were declared a Clearance Area by the Council in June and a further area is at present in the course of preparation. As may be seen by my report on Food and Drugs the number of samples taken, etc., is being maintained and contraventions of the Act are still being found. In January 1956 as mentioned in the paragraph 11 on Food Hygiene the new Food Hygiene Regulations come into force, these Regulations give the Council considerably more control over the handling of food and of the minimum of equipment necessary on premises in which food is prepared, sold or stored. The administration of the Food and Drugs Act caused a considerable increase in the work of the department and the new Regulations will add further to the total amount. The Sanitary Inspectors are maintaining the previous standard of efficiency and as the new duties under various Acts and Regulations come into force have attended lectures and discussions, some in their own time, in order to make themselves conversant with the details and variations. A certain amount of overtime is necessary in dealing with Shops Acts, etc., and this has always been undertaken willingly. In conclusion I wish to tender my thanks to other officers of the Council and members of the staff for their assistance and cooperation throughout the year. W. K.

It may be noticed that under the heading of Public Health 4,851 visits have been made. This is slightly less than the previous year but if the number of visits over the whole Table are taken into consideration it will be found that in fact there has been a slight increase, the visits being differently allocated. Nuisance and Sanitary Defects. Of the number of visits made under Public Health 4,478 were made under this sub-heading. These visits practically entirely comprise inspections made relating to complaints and re-inspections of those complaints. The preliminary notices served during the year under Table II being 124 arise mainly from the result of the work under this sub-heading. The number of these notices is practically the same as in the previous year, and of the 124 notices served 116 were complied with during the period. Table III gives a list of improvements effected as a result of notices served and again keeps very similar to previous years. Infectious Diseases and Food Poisoning There have been less visits made on Infectious Diseases during the year mainly owing to the reduction in the number of notified diseases, as may be seen from Table I of the Medical Officer of Health's Report. 16 There has been very little Food Poisoning reported during the year and with the exception of several cases which occurred in a local school there have been no outbreaks. With regard to these a considerable number of children were away ill with symptoms which were similar to those of food poisoning. As the majority of these children did not visit their doctors no notifications of Food Poisoning were received in the office. However, the case was taken up by the department and after a considerable number of visits and consultations with the Headmaster of the school it was ultimately found that a canteen worker had apparently suffered with Food Poisoning prior to this outbreak. The worker was suspended from work until such time as the pathologist reported that she was clear of any possibility of spreading further disease. Schools, Smoke Observations, Etc. The majority of the remaining sub-headings under this item were routine Public Health matters. There was a considerable increase in the smoke observations made, these being mainly concerned with one factory and although this factory was kept and is being kept under very careful observation, no nuisance was at any time noted. The factory have done all within their power to co-operate with the department to ensure that there is no likelihood of a nuisance being caused. The complaints received regarding smell, etc., from this factory have recently been much less mainly owing to different arrangements having been made for the disposal of certain wastes. FACTORIES During 1955 the routine visits to factories and outworkers for the purposes of the Factories Acts have continued and in the year in question 321 visits were made and 5 contraventions were found. Notices were served on the occupiers of the factories and the necessary work was carried out. The condition of factories generally in this area is reasonable as far as the Sections for which the local authority are responsible. Considering that there are 104 factories in the district the number of notices served is small. SHOPS ACTS This is the second year for which this Council has been the authority under the Shops Acts and the general survey which was taken in the previous year has been continued. Some 765 visits have been made to various types of shops and no serious contraventions of the Acts have been found up to the present. In most cases in which the shops have not entirely complied with the provisions of the Acts a satisfactory conclusion has been reached after discussion with the occupiers. The anomalies under the Early Day Closing Orders have not yet been adjusted but it is hoped that this will be dealt with in 1956. Until this matter has been satisfactorily adjusted it is not possible 17 to enforce the Early Closing Day and to deal with any variations and difficulties which arise under this section. HOUSING In 1955 work under the Housing Act, 1936, has increased being mainly preparatory work of survey and inspection, preparation of reports, etc., so that the Council would have the information to complete the form required by the Minister under Section 1 of the Housing (Repairs and Rents) Act, 1954, and the drawing up of a programme of work in this field for the following years. The Council declared a Clearance Area, Albert Road, during this period, this being the first to be dealt with since the end of the war, and is the beginning of the programme of improvement of housing conditions in the area. Owing to. the precedence which Survey and programming of work has taken no demolition orders have been served under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, a Closing Order under Section 11(2) of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions), Act, 1953, was made and an existing Demolition Order revoked on 107 Leicester Road in December. The Council served notices under Section 11 on 8 and 10 Lyonsdown Road. At the beginning of the year there were 11 Demolition Orders and 2 Closing Orders outstanding being:— 42 and 44 Cat Hill, East Barnet Demolition Order 2 and 4 Hadley Road, New Barnet Demolition Order 113, 115, 117, and 119 Lancaster Road, New Barnet Demolition Order 54 Edward Road, New Barnet Demolition Order 14 Warwick Cottages, New Barnet Demolition Order 107 Leicester Road, New Barnet Demolition Order 9 Warwick Cottages Closing Order 8 Lyonsdown Road, Basement Flat, New Barnet Closing Order Of these properties 42 and 44 Cat Hill and 2 and 4 Hadley Road have been demolished; 113 to 119 Lancaster Road have been vacated and are awaiting demolition and the remainder are vacant. As previously mentioned the Demolition Order on 107 Leicester Road was revoked and replaced with a Closing Order. The two Closing Orders are still operative although in December 1955 Notices under the Housing Act, 1936, were served on the owner, etc., of the premises 8 and 10 Lyonsdown Road of which one of the outstanding Closing Orders forms a part. Albert Road Clearance Area In June the Medical Officer of Health made representation to the Council regarding Albert Road and the Council subsequently declared this to be a Clearance Area and forwarded the necessary documents to the Minister. The area consists of 23 houses on both 18 sides of Albert Road, which is a cul-de-sac, leading to the Gas works and bounded on the west side by the railway. The main reasons for the representation by the Medical Officer of Health were disrepair and dampness. The Order has not yet been confirmed by the Minister and a public enquiry will probably be held in 1956 into this matter. Housing Survey. In order that a reasonable opinion of the condition of housing in the district could be formed the Council decided that a survey of houses should be made. Between June, 1954, and June, 1955, about 2,000 houses were inspected in order to implement this decision. So that the necessary work could be carried out without severe dislocation of existing duties additional staff were employed. As the work was proceeded with the houses were divided into three main categories (1) being those which were reasonable fit; (2) being those which were unfit for human habitation but were capable of being rendered fit at reasonable expense; and (3) houses unfit for habitation which were either incapable of being rendered fit and in which the cost of the work to render them fit was unreasonable. It will be seen that Category (2) was by reason of its definition of very wide application as it included houses which just did not satisfy condition (1) or which on the other hand were not quite so bad as to be placed in Category (3). When the work was practically completed a report was placed before the Council in June with sufficient information so that the Council could consider the return required by the Minister under Section 1 of the Housing (Rents and Repairs) Act, 1954. Of the 2,000 houses inspected it was found that 415 were graded as unfit for human habitation and incapable of being rendered fit at a reasonable expense. Of these 132 were houses which could be dealt with under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, and the remainder were included in Clearance Areas. In the report 21 Clearance Areas were suggested ranging in size from 5 to 25 houses with one exception which contains 58 houses. The Council's return to the Minister gave a period of 11 years to deal with the total problem and 170 houses in Clearance Areas and 20 houses under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, to be dealt with in the first five years. A start on this programme was made when the Council declared Albert Road a Clearance Area and the work of detailed inspection and survey is in progress for another area. It is proposed to place before the Council in the near future a suggested programme of Clearance Areas to cover the next five years in accordance with the return to the Minister. FOOD HYGIENE The inspection of food premises has continued during the year, 2,158 inspections having been made. This number is slightly higher than last year. The general standard throughout the district has 19 continued to be high and although a few notices have been served during the year for want of cleanliness and other defects the irregularities have been minor. In January 1956 the Food Hygiene Regulations will come into force and these will mean a large increase in the number of visits made and also from a general reading of the Regulations a considerable amount of work in most of the food premises in the district. The Regulations on the whole are very good and are designed to reduce the possibility of food poisoning and to promote hygienic methods. I feel that although it is necessary to have the necessary equipment and layout in food premises the actual hygiene in the end rests with the food handlers, and that it is hygienic methods of handling and treatment of food that is of major importance. This is always impressed as far as possible on the occupiers of the various premises which are visited. Milk Supply The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936-1949:— Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 11 Sterilised 13 The following Supplementary licences under Principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area were also granted:— Tuberculin Tested 12 Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 11 Ninety-four samples of milk were purchased and submitted lor bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health's Emergency Public Health Laboratory at Hertford:— No. of Samples Submitted Test applied:— (a) Methylene blue. (b)Turbidity (c) Phosphatase. Result of Examination:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory T.T. Pasteurised 13 (a) and (c) 12 1 T.T. Farm Bottled 21 (a) 19 2 Pasteurised 35 (a) and (c) 34 1 Homogenised Past 6 (a) and (c) 5 1 Sterilised 19 (b) 19 — This is the first time for several years in which unsatisfactory reports on samples of milk have been found. In the case of unsatisfactory reports the two unsatisfactory samples of T.T. Farm Bottled Milk both came from the same farm and were the result of a defective cooler. The farm in question has a comparatively small milk output and has only one cooler. This cooler went out of action due to a mechanical fault and the farmer instead of finding other means of 20 cooling the milk placed it on the market uncooled; the result can be seen in the Table above. The T.T. Pasteurised and Homogenised Pasteurised samples were taken from one retailer and as the dairy was out of the district the complaints were passed on to the authority concerned. The local authority in which the dairy is situated took the matter up with the dealer and certain alterations were suggested in the plant. Since these samples were taken no further unsatisfactory reports have been received from that dealer. The remaining unsatisfactory sample of Pasteurised milk was from one of the large multiple firms and although a very thorough survey was made of the plant, etc., it is entirely unexplained, and from the manner in which the milk is handled it appears to be impossible for any milk to remain unpasteurised. Again no further unsatisfactory reports have been received. Ice Cream Five applications were received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises being satisfactory, all five applications were granted. Seventy-four samples were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination, with the following results:— Provisional grade 1 63 „ „ 2 6 „ „ 3 4 „ „ 4 1 74 During the year there was only one Grade 4 sample of ice cream. This sample was of loose ice cream and was probably caused by the use of an unclean server. Further samples taken from the same premises have been satisfactory. The samples of ice cream taken during the year show that on the whole the ice cream is well handled. The majority of the retailers now sell wrapped ice cream which from our point of view is far less likely to become contaminated. There is only one person in the district registered as a manufacturer of ice cream and he manufactures only very occasionally and then in small quantities. All the other local retailers obtain their supplies of ice cream from the large wholesale firms. This ice cream is manufactured to a very high standard and the quality remains constant. Meat and Other Food Inspections The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been carried out as regards all premises on which meat is sold for human consumption. 21 The inspection of food (other than meat) is carried out as necessary. As may be seen from the Table of foods during the year, a total amount of over 16 cwts. of food of various types was condemned as unfit for human consumption. Co-operation between this office and the retailers of food continues to be extremely good and no difficulties have been experienced in this connection. INFESTATIONS Rodent Control During the year 428 complaints of rats and mice have been received. All of these premises were visited and in addition premises on which the infestations may have arose or which may have been affected were also visited, in consequence some 716 properties received visits during the year and it was found that 473 of these were infested with rats or mice. All the infestations were dealt with by the Rodent Operator. The number of complaints received have considerably increased over the year. The majority of the infestations treated during the year have been of a minor character and treatments have in general been successful. In a few cases difficulty has been experienced, but by re-treatment and variations of both poisoning and bait satisfactory results have been obtained. The usual poisons, warfarin, zinc phosphide, arsenic and red squill have been employed in the majority of cases. In accordance with the requirements of the Rodent Control Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, two treatments of the sewers were made. The first in April being a maintenance treatment and the second in November being the annual 10 per cent. test of the sewer manholes, followed by a treatment based on the results of the test. The maintenance treatment of the sewers which was carried out in April consisted of prebaiting 35 manholes with sausage rusk. These manholes being those which showed "takes" at previous treatments, with the addition of manholes in the immediate vicinity. Of the manholes prebaited 13 showed "takes," these were subsequently poison baited with sausage rusk and zinc phosphide. Two days after laying the poison it was found that in 13 cases the bait had been partially consumed. During the annual 10 per cent. test of the sewer manholes in November 170 manholes were baited with damp sausage rusk, and on an inspection being made two days later in 12 cases the bait had been taken. This test was followed by a treatment in which 49 manholes were pre-baited, consisting of those in which bait was partially or completely taken and those in the immediate vicinity. Thirty-one of these manholes showed "takes", these being poison 22 baited when 19 partial "takes" were found. There were no complete "takes" of poison bait. From the above result it is indicated that the sewers of the area are not seriously rat infested. Insect Control The number of complaints that are being received regarding infestations by various types of insects, not necessarily fleas and bugs, is increasing. In these cases assistance and advice are given and where necessary insecticides are supplied free of charge. The number of verminous premises which have been treated during the year is extremely low, and the existence of fleas and bugs in houses in this area is now rare. FOOD AND DRUGS The following table shows the various types of food and drugs sampled during the year and the results of the analyses:— Samples Analysed Samples Unsatisfactory Amoniated Tincture of Quinine 2 2 Butter 1 Buttered Brazils 1 Buttermints 1 Butterscotch 1 Buttered Toast 1 Camphorated Oil 1 Cheese Spread 1 Chicken, Minced 1 Coconut, Desiccated 1 Condiment, Non-Brewed 1 Compound Glycerine of Thymol 1 Crab, Dressed 1 Cream 1 Cream of Tartar 1 Curry Powder 1 Dripping 1 Energen Rolls 1 Epsom Salts 1 Flavourings 2 Flour, Self Raising 2 Fruit Syrup 1 Gelatine 1 Ginger, Ground 1 Glauber Salts 1 Glycerine 1 Mixed Herbs 1 Horseradish Sauce 1 Ice Lollies 2 1 Jam, Apple & Raspberry 1 Jam, Apricot 1 Lard 3 Lemon Drink 2 1 Margarine (containing 10% butter) 2 Margarine (Labelled 25% cream) 1 1 Marzipan 1 23 Milk 20 7 Milk, Channel Island or South Devon 3 1 Milk, Condensed, Skimmed 3 3 Oranges 1 Pepper 2 Pork Pie 1 Quinine Compound Tablets 1 Rice, Ground 1 Rolls and Butter 8 3 Salvolatile 1 Sausages, Beef 3 1 Sausages, Pork 5 Soup, Cream of Mushroom 1 1 Sugar, Tinted Crystals 1 Tea 1 Vinegar 3 Whisky 2 101 21 In addition to the above-mentioned commodities 44 informal samples of milk were examined at the office for fat content. I would like to comment briefly on the samples found to be unsatisfactory. Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine Two samples of this drug were found to be deficient in ammonia to the extent of 27 % and 49 % respectively. In each case it was found that the solution had been stored in the shop for a long period, in in the second instance for over ten years, and a letter was sent to all retail chemists in the district pointing out the importance and necessity for the periodical examination of their stocks of those drugs which might deteriorate on being stored for long periods. Ice Lollies A sample of a raspberry flavoured Ice Lolly, manufactured in the district, was found to contain lead to the extent of 3.5 parts per million. An orange flavoured lolly taken from the same shop contained only .85 parts of lead per million. The lead content of lollies should not exceed 1 part per million and in view of the fact that the vendor was selling these lollies at 1d. each and did a considerable trade among children, particularly due to the very warm weather enjoyed during last summer, it was suggested to him that he should obtain new moulds of plastic or other suitable material, to which suggestion he willingly agreed. The difference in the lead content of the two samples was due either to the differing acidities of the fruit syrup used or to the length of the time the lollies were kept in the moulds. Lemon Drink An informal sample of a proprietary Lemon Drink was submitted for analysis and found to be in an active state of fermentation and 24 to contain alcohol to the extent of 2.86 per cent. equivalent to 5 per cent. of proof spirit. Further enquiries showed that one or two batches of this particular product were made in which the preservative, sodium benzoate, was precipitated out and was therefore, not present in the concentration required to exert preservative action. The manufacturers immediately recalled the affected batches and stated that steps would be taken to overcome the problem. Margarine One sample of margarine was contained in a wrapper which stated that the product contained 25 per cent. fresh dairy cream. Section 32(2) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 required that where a label stated or suggested that margarine contained butter, a statement of the percentage of butter contained therein should also be given. The wrapper stated the presence of 25 per cent. of fresh dairy cream but no declaration of the proportion of butter fat though the analysis showed this to be 10 per cent. In view of the fact that the matter had been considered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, no further action was taken and the labelling of margarine containing a percentage of cream has now been made quite clear by the coming into operation of the Labelling of Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1955. Milk A sample of South Devon milk was found to contain at least 3 per cent added water. Proceedings were authorised by the Council and the vendors of the milk, who pleaded guilty in Court, fined a total of £10 with £4 4s. Od. costs. In view of the fact that the demand for this milk is mainly from families with young children or invalids and the price is 1d. per pint more than ordinary pasteurised milk it is deplorable that added water should be found. The remaining unsatisfactory samples of milk related to bottles which contain foreign substances. In two instances where a snail and pieces of glass were found in bottles proceedings.were taken and in each case the Court imposed fines of £10. Condensed Machine Skimmed Milk As a result of a report appearing in the National Press that certain condensed machine skimmed milk which had been released for animal feeding purposes was being sold for human consumption visits were made to grocers shops in the district and samples taken of a brand being sold below the recognised price. Analysis showed some contamination by copper and a rather high figure for acidity. The milk was slightly brown in colour but was free from any objectionable smell until heated when an objectionable smell was immediately apparent. 25 Dr. Hamence considered that at some stage the milk had suffered from some form of decomposition and was no longer suitable for human consumption. As a result of this report 84 tins of the particular brand of milk were surrendered for destruction. Rolls and Butter Three samples of rolls and butter purchased in cafes in the district were found to contain margarine. In view of the prices charged and the fact that plenty of butter is now available it would seem the practice of serving margarine for butter in cafes and restaurants without the display of an appropriately worded notice is the survival of a war-time custom which is now plainly dishonest. Warning letters were sent by the Council to the three vendors concerned. Sausages Recent Court decisions have made the sampling of sausages in respect of their meat content futile but samples have been taken for examination in respect of the preservative content. In one instance beef sausages were found to contain preservative though no notice to the effect was exhibited in the shop. A warning letter was sent to the butcher concerned and a further letter to all shops where sausages were sold drawing attention to the requirements of the Public Health (Preservatives in Food) Regulations. Cream Soups A sample of Cream of Mushroom Soup which was being sold at approximately half the normal price was examined and found to contain no appreciable quantity of butter fat and had a total fat content of only 3 per cent. Cream soups prepared with fat other than butter fat should contain at least 3½ per cent of fat. The firm selling the soup immediately withdrew the brand from sale when informed of the result of the analysis and correspondence with the suppliers revealed that this particular brand was in fact old stock having been manufactured about 1951 and that margarine had been used in which the moisture content varied considerably. In my last report I commented that it would be the policy of the department as far as possible not to sample foods known to be satisfactory and that a constant watch would be kept for new types of foods, packings and manufacturers. This policy has been adhered to and is responsible for what may, at first glance, appear to be a rather high percentage of unsatisfactory samples. Also, the importance of sampling foods and drugs known to deteriorate after long storage and those foods on sale at prices below those generally recognised is emphasised by the results of the year's work. 26
