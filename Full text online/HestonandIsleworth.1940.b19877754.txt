HES 27 Borough of Heston and Isleworth 1940 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE B<&e&vdi> Borough of Heston and Isleworth Public Health Department, 92 Bath Road, HOUNSLOW. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Heston and Isleworth. Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report on the work of the Health Department for the year 194 0. In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 2 067 the report is type-writ ten and is presented largely in the form of a tabulated summary with the corresponding details for 1939 shown for purposes of comparison. The usual records have been kept in the department so that a more detailed report, if required, could be made at a later date. The various sections of the department had restored their full pre-war service by the beginning of February, This service has been maintained in all sections except in that of the Sanitary Inspectors. The work of billeting and re-housing has encroached and continues to encroach seriously on the routine duties of the Sanitary Inspectors and this is reflected in the statistics dealing with their work. Apart from the outbreak of cerebro-spinal fever early in the year the Borough was free from any epidemic. Despite strenuous efforts to popularise diphtheria immunisation there was an increase in the number of cases of diphtheria. There was an increase in the notifications but a reduction in deaths from tuberculosis. The increase in cases and deaths from pneumonia was associated with the severe winter weather. The death rate showed a definite increase. Apart from enemy action no other cause of death calls for special note. Of the total deaths, 22.6 per cent., 19.0 per cent. and 6.3 per cent, occurred at ages 65-75, 75 - 85 and over 85 respectively. The precentage of deaths occurring at age 65 or over was 48 as compared with 45 in 1938 and 32 in 1908-15. The increase of infant deaths under one year of age was not due to any one cause of death. Apart from a greater toll of life at the extremes of age the health of the Borough showed no deterioration when compared with the year 1939. No specific evidence was found during the year that war conditions were having an adverse effect on the general health of the population. Work in connection with civil defence pressed heavily on the department during the year but the staff responded well to the call for additional effort. For their loyal assistance I am especially grateful. I desire to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Committees for their support and to my colleagues in other departments for their co-operation. I remain, Your obedient servant, A. ANDERSON. Medical Officer of Health. GENERAL STATISTICS. 194 0. 1939.
