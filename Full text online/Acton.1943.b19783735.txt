ACT 46 Borough of Acton ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health together with the Report on the Medical Inspection of Schools FOR THE YEAR 1943 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1943. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1943. The annual report of the School Medical Service is given separately at the end. In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 2773, the annual report is an interim report, mentioning as briefly as possible all essential matters, but remaining mainly statistical in form. On December 18th, 1943, the Medical Officer of Health, Dr. G. E. B. Payne, joined His Majesty's Forces, and this report of his work has had to be compiled in his absence. Other staff changes included the retirement of Mr. J. J. Jenkins, Chief Sanitary Inspector, who, when he left, had completed 38 years of service with the Borough. Mr. J. J. Matthews was appointed Chief Sanitary Inspector in his place. A Home Help Scheme was started during the year. Two full time Home Helps were engaged and the Public Health Department endeavours to keep a list of women who will be willing to act as 4 part time Home Helps as and when required. Unfortunately however, this type of work has not a large appeal, and the ideal person for the post is not easily found. The scheme however, has been found to be of real benefit, and demands for bookings of Home Helps are increasing as the scheme becomes known. In July, 1943, Circular 2831 from the Ministry of Health asked Authorities to take special steps to tackle the question of infestation by head lice amongst children both of pre-school and of school age. Following this Circular a special drive was made by the Health Visitors and School Nurses. Children attending the Welfare Clinics were examined for this in addition to their general examination, and special visits were paid to the homes of children known to be chronic offenders. It is realised that infestation is nearly always a family affair and the co-operation of the mother was solicited, special steel combs were issued on loan or for sale, and careful instructions as to methods of eradication were given. Attempts were made to establish a modified cleansing station which could deal with Scabies and head lice locally, but no success attended these endeavours owing to difficulties with equipment and staff. Body lice are almost unknown in Acton, the only cases dealt with during the year being incomers who were cleansed at the Medicinal Baths at Kensington, with which Borough, Acton has an arrangement for that purpose. It is realised that poor and crowded housing conditions make it more difficult for some families to attain and keep a good standard of personal hygiene, but all available help was offered to families known to be infested, to become cleansed as a family, and, the evil once having been completely eradicated, it was pointed out that subsequent freedom from re-infection would be easier to maintain. A new preparation, Lethane hair oil, was advocated, and supplied and used at the Day Nurseries in the Borough. This preparation is not only deadly to the head louse, but acts as a deterrent to re-infestation. Posters and pamphlets anent the dangers of lice infestation were exhibited at Welfares and schools, and distributed where it was considered advisable. Many cases referred to the Public Health Department from factories were cleansed. The total numbers treated will be found embodied in the report. Vital statistic figures show that the births taking place during the year have gone up, and the birth rate rose from 16.7 for 1942 to 17.9 for 1943. The Infant death rate was again high but less than in 1942. Gastro Enteritis again took its toll of young lives. No obvious explanation emerges from investigation, but the plague of 5 house flies which existed during the summer, with their opportunities for spreading infection, cannot be ignored. Gastro Enteritis was rife in the old days of horse drawn traffic and it is felt that the conditions suitable for fly breeding which the stables fostered in the past, are reproduced by the present day habit of keeping chicken and rabbits in so many small back gardens. A table showing the causes of infantile mortality during the year is included in the report. Gastro Enteritis, congenital defects and prematurity, account for the bulk of the deaths. It will be noticed that all but one of the deaths from Gastro Enteritis occurred after one month of life. During the first month of life, the great majority of babies are breast/ fed, when the liability to infection is reduced to a minimum. The Civil Defence Casualty Service continued to be administered from the Public Health Department, and the personnel carried out their duties during the year in a very satisfactory manner.

By arrangement with the Ministry of Health, all materials requiring bacteriological examination have been sent to the Emergency Medical Service Laboratory, Churchfield Road, Ealing. Ambulance Facilities. Since the 1st April, 1942, the Borough Council has been responsible for maintaining the Ambulance Service previously administered by the Acton Fire Brigade. Civil Defence personnel are responsible for manning the ambulances. 12 The Acton & Wembley Joint Hospital Board still maintain an ambulance for removal of infectious cases. Nursing in the Home. The same facilities exist as in previous years, the number of sick persons under care was 406, necessitating 12,660 visits. Hospital Provision. The Acton Borough Council together with the Wembley Borough Council maintain a Joint Hospital for treatment of infectious cases. The Acton Voluntary Hospital treats both surgical and medical cases, as does the Central Middlesex County Hospital which is maintained by the Middlesex County Council. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. Four centres were open all the year for Infant Welfare Clinics: (1) At School Clinic, Avenue Road. (Two Health Visitors's districts served at this Centre.) (2) At Rothschild Road School. (3) At John Perryn School. (4) At St. Gabriel's Church Hall, Noel Road. At all Centres during the year it was found necessary to open relief sessions, and in this way each Health Visitor had one session weekly with a doctor in attendance and one with no doctor in attendance. It will thus be seen that, in all, 10 weekly child welfare clinics were held. Weekly average attendances at the various centres were as follows: Central district 64 South East district 82 North West district 69 South West -district 71 North East district 74 A representative from the Food Office attended the Clinic for each district weekly, and cod liver oil and fruit juices were sold at each centre. Attached is a table showing the attendances at these Clinics, and also the visits paid by the Health Visitors to the homes. 13 The numbers of mothers and children seen and treated at the Ophthalmic and Dental clinics are given by the School Oculist and Dentist in the School Medical portion of this report. Health Visiting. Number of visits paid during the year by all Health Visitors working in the area: (a) To expectant mothers First visits 509 Total visits 1062 (b) To children under one year First visits 066 Total visits 4617 (c) To children between the ages of 1 and 5 years Total visits 3889 Infant Welfare Centres. Total number of children who first attended the Centres during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance, were:— (a) Under one year of age 820 (b) Between the ages of 1 and 5 years 51 Total number of children under 5 years of age who attended at the Centres during the year and who, at the end of the year, were:— (a) Under one year of age 703 (b) Over one year 1124 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year:— (a) By children under one year of age 13443 (b) By children between 1 and 5 years 5045 Midwifery Service. Domiciliary midwifery was performed as in previous years by Queen Charlottes midwives. Expectant mothers wishing to be confined in Hospital had to make application to Central Middlesex Hospital, where owing to shortage of beds admission was regulated according to the patients' medical condition and home circumstances. Not all who wished to be confined in Central Middlesex were able to do so. During 1943, 384 expectant mothers made application for admission, but only 294 were accepted. 90 had, therefore, to make alternative arrangements. 14 Early in the year it was found necessary to open a third weekly Ante Natal Clinic as attendances were growing steadily. Clinics were held at 45 Avenue Road on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings at 10 and on Wednesday afternoons at 1.30. A representative from the Food Office attended these Clinics for the sale of fruit juices and cod liver oil. New Cases attending Clinics during the year = 899 (6 of these were found not to be pregnant). Total Attendances = 3700 Average weekly attendances = 71 (3 Clinics) The following table gives the stage of pregnancy at which the new cases reported for examination. 1 month pregnant 22* 2 „ „ 154* 3 „ „ 245* 4 „ „ 218 5 ,, „ 159 6 „ „ 62 7 ,, „ 25 8 ,, „ 14 *6 of these proved to be non-pregnant. It will be noted that 46.4% of cases came while 1-3 months pregnant while 70.9% came while 1-4 months pregnant. Comparatively few mothers arrived for their first examination late in pregnancy and many of these were transferred from other districts. Expectant mothers are encouraged to come as early as possible. 94% of the mothers who gave birth to infants in 1943 attended the Ante Natal Clinics—the bulk of them being referred to the Ante Natal Clinics at Central Middlesex Hospital and Queen Charlottes Hospital at the 36th week of pregnancy. Below is a table giving the percentages, of pregnant women with the arrangements they made for their confinements. Confined at Central Middlesex Hospital — 43.5% ,, Home (attended by Queen Char lotte's Hospital nurses) 32.6% ,, Queen Charlotte's Hospital 13.5% „ Other Hospitals 4. % ,, Nursing Homes 6.4% 15 Expectant Mothers evacuated.

During the year the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres supplied the undermentioned quantities of milk foods: For sale 23,789 lbs. Free 292 lbs. The Food Executive Officer has very kindly supplied the following figures of milk and Vitamin supplements issued by his department: Fruit juices and Cod Liver Oil to Expectant Mothers 464 Fruit juices and Cod Liver Oil to children 3500 Cod Liver Oil only to children Nil Dried milk to children 96 Liquid milk to children: (а) Free 220 (b) Cheap rate 3817 Liquid milk to Expectant Mothers: (a) Free 52 (b) Cheap rate 412 16 Birth Control Clinic. The Borough has an arrangement with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Centre for birth control, and during the year two patients were sent for advice. Home Helps. During the, year two full time Home Helps were appointed. We were fortunate in obtaining suitable women and fully expect, as the scheme grows, that more and more use will be made of the services of these women. A Home Help scheme is a difficult one to administer, in that the work is intermittent and cannot be regulated. Births frequently do not occur at the exact time expected, and so a steady supply of cases cannot be guaranteed to the Home Helps. If they have been booked for a certain time and the birth is delayed, the Home Helps must stand by until the iase comes off and in these circumstances we have utilised their services in the Borough's Wartime Day Nurseries, where they are available at a minute's notice. A table of cases is appended. It is hoped in the future to extend the service to cover other than confinement cases, or pregnant women who have been ordered extra rest, but up-to-date this has not been possible.

Municipal Nursery' Pre-War 30 76 255 Attendances at all Nurseries were variable owing to an epidemic of Measles in the Borough early in the year, and one of German Measles in the Autumn. 'Places' at the Nurseries were fully taken up and 'Longcot' area in particular had a long waiting list for admissions. Various schemes were considered to extend Day Nursery accommodation in the Bedford Park area and after many attempts a suitable house was secured just over the Borough boundary in Chiswick. The scheme however never came to fruition owing to change of policy by the Ministry of Health and their decision not to open any further Day Nurseries. < Horn Lane Day Nursery was extended to accommodate 60 children and the extension was opened in March, 1943. The following Table shows the average daily attendance at each Nursery. Under 2 years of age. Over 2 years of age. Horn Lane 17.9 25 Friars Place Lane 11 19.9 Longcot 18.7 19.1 Birkbeck Road 19.8 28.8 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 835 cases of notifiable disease occurred in the Borough in 1943. 459 of these were cases of Measles, of which there was a prolonged but mild epidemic during the year. There was also an increase in 18 cases of Scarlet Fever, a total of 109 as against 51 in 1942. There were, however, fewer cases of Whooping Cough, 24 as against 63. There were no deaths from Scarlet Fever or Measles, and only one death from Diphtheria and one from Pneumonia following Whooping Cough, the death taking place in Central Middlesex Hospital. 81 cases of Pneumonia were notified during the year, in 1942 there were only 35 cases. Influenza. There was a widespread epidemic of Influenza in the latter part of the year and a Circular from the Ministry of Health advised each Authority to formulate a scheme to help with nursing and home duties. Arrangements as follows were therefore made: — (1) The British Red Cross Society would provide help in nursing cases in their own homes. (2) The W. V. S. would send women to help with domestic duties, cooking, cleaning or shopping. (3) The local Girl Guides were approached and were willing to supply any help they could, running messages, doing shopping, etc. (4) The Secretary of the local Medical War Committee would apply to Army and Air Force for relief in medical attendance if that became necessary and local practitioners found themselves unable to deal with large numbers of cases. There was very little call for the service, 4 applications only being received, but help was supplied to every case where it was required. One case required nursing and the Red Cross Society assisted. Three cases required domestic help, and the W.V.S. gave that help. Fortunately the type of Influenza was mild and the majority of people were in bed only a matter of three or four days. Diphtheria Immunisation. Immunisation was practised as before and every effort was made to induce parents to have their children protected. The following means were employed to contact all children under 14: (a) At the age of 6 months, a notice is sent to the parents of every child whose birth was notified to the Public Health department. (b) The parents of all children attending Welfare Centres are approached. 19 (c) All children admitted to Day Nurseries are offered protection. (d) Health Visitors, calling at the homes of children who do not attend the Welfare Centres, advise the parents. (e) New school entrants are given consent forms by the Head Mistress. (f) Prior to each school medical inspection, a questionnaire is sent to each parent. One of the questions asks ' Has your child been immunised against Diphtheria?' If the answer is in the negative, a form of consent with advice re time and place for inoculation, is sent. All immunised cases are followed up, and a single injection is offered at the end of every three years in order to refresh the child's waning immunity. After the age of 11 years, this is preceded by a Schick test. For children under five, if they have not had the disease, immunisation against Whooping Cough is combined with the Diphtheria injection. Good results appear to be obtained, injections do not always prevent the infection, but the severity of the illness is modified. During the year, 19 cases of Diphtheria were notified amongst non-school age population, and of these, in 9 cases only was the diagnosis substantiated. Nine of these cases were adults and the rest children under school age. Only one of the children under school age who contracted Diphtheria appears to have been immunised, and in her case she had a positive nasal swab, but no clinical signs of the disease. One child died of Diphtheria, she had not been immunised.

Appended are Tables showing the cases sent during the year to the Kensington Medicinal Baths for cleansing from Vermin and treatment of Scabies. These have been divided into areas, times of the year and number of families treated. It is important in both Scabies and head infestations, that all affected members of the family should be treated simultaneously, otherwise re-infection takes place and time and energy are wasted in useless treatment. Difficulty often occurs with members of the family who are working, but the Kensington Baths run two evening sessions, and advantage of this.fact has been taken wherever possible. 24 PATIENTS TREATED AT KENSINGTON BATHS FOR VERMINOUS CONDITIONS.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. 25 Drainage and Sewerage. All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are drained into the main sewerage system. By arrangement with the London County Council the sewage is discharged into the London sewers. Storm water is filtered and emptied into the Thames. Public Cleansing. The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1943 was 13,475 tons, of which 2,778 tons was salvage, the remaining 10,697*tons was disposed of by burning at the Destructor. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The following Table includes the tabular statement furnished by the Sanitary Inspector under Article 27 (18) of the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) Regulations, 1935.

In connection with food premises, wholesalers, depots, shops, canteens, etc., upwards of 26,000 containers of preserved or manufactured food and a quantity of unpreserved food of various kinds has been dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. 28 There is evidence that greater care in handling and transport and quicker disposal from stores and shops has resulted in a lower incidence of food unfit for human consumption. The arrangement with the Ministry of Food Salvage Division as to the salvage of surrendered foodstuffs is still in operation. Milk. Regular inspection of the 14 dairies within the Borough has shown that a good, hygienic standard is maintained, bearing in mind all the difficulties as to material and labour. In connection with the pasteurisation ,of milk, the High Temperature Short Time Process, is being generally adopted and it would appear that with this treatment and a resultant saving of time and labour, a more hygienic and generally satisfactory distribution of milk will ensue. Milk Sampling. During the year 85 samples of milk have been taken from premises or roundsmen within the Borough, and submitted for bacteriological examination. Of these, only 5 were found to be unsatisfactory and steps were taken in every case to ensure an improvement in the supply. One bad sample was taken from a local dairy and inspection of the premises revealed that the bottle sterilizer was not efficient, owing to the fact that parts for renewal were unprocurable. The matter was closed in this case by the business being taken over by a Dairy Company following the demolition of the premises as the result of enemy action. , The other 4 unsatisfactory samples, were of milk-bottled outside the Borough and sold from shops or distributed on rounds in Acton. In two of these cases contact was established with the Local Authority in those districts where the bottling took place. In the other 2 cases, representatives of the milk distributors concerned were interviewed on this matter and with respect to complaints as to dirty bottles. A general improvement of the milk supply ensued and there was no further cause for complaint. Other Sampling. Informal samples of Colonial tinned jam, beef extract and biscuits were examined by the Analyst and found to be satisfactory 29 An informal sample of Gelatine submitted for examination was found to contain deleterious matter, and this was noted to the Middlesex County Council. A formal sample was taken and, as a result, the distribution of this commodity was discontinued. 8 samples of water were taken from various premises and, on examination, all proved satisfactory. Slaughterhouses. The slaughterhouses at Atlas Road and Hanbury Road have been in commission throughout the year, and the carcase of every animal slaughtered has been examined as to its fitness for human food. The number of animals slaughtered is 76,702 pigs and 2,839 horses. Tables showing the details of meat and offal surrendered following examination by the Sanitary Inspectors will be found on the two succeeding pages.

Ladies and Gentlemen, We beg to submit the following report upon the schools and school children of Acton for the year 1943. As requested by the Board of Education the report will be as brief as possible, and mainly statistical in form. All schools were open for the year 1943, and all Clinics were continued as in previous years. The only change in School Medical inspection was made, when in response to a suggestion in Circular 1604, school entrants and leavers were concentrated on in preference to the middle years of school life. Later, however, it was found possible to return to the former method of examining entrants, intermediates and leavers as we used to do. Diphtheria immunisation was carried out as previously, but it was not found possible to visit schools to perform inoculations there, and cases for inoculation were called from all schools to the School Clinic, where regular weekly sessions for that purpose were held. The number of children on the roll at the end of the year was 5,110, and during the year three (3) additional nursery classes were opened, making a total of 15. Speech Therapy classes were held during the year, Miss Richnell, who joined the staff in October 1942 for that purpose, has submitted a resume of the work which is included in the report. Scabies continued to be a troublesome complaint, but during the year there were fewer cases than in 1942—perhaps an encouraging sign that the peak number for this disease has been passed, 34 and that the increase of cases noted ever since 1935 will now stop. The steady insistence on treating all members of a family, whether obviously affected or not, may now, for the first time be shewing its effect. We can only hope so, and watch developments. School Nurses, during the year, paid particular attention to verminous conditions, and for this purpose visited schools as frequently as possible. Perhaps their extra attention to this branch of their work may account for the increase in cases noted pver 1942. Every effort has been made to encourage and advise the parents of infested children to get the trouble out of the household instead of treating individual children. It is unfortunately true, however, that many infested people resent advice and are too apt to construe it as insulting and interfering. SCHOOL MEALS AND MILK. Number of meals supplied—1943 323,991 Number of free meals supplied:— Ordinary Schools 27,169 Special School 313 Number of bottles of free milk supplied:— Ordinary Schools 67,130 Special School 551 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Scarlet Fever. 60 cases were reported during 1943 in the school population, the distribution being as follows:— Acton Wells 4 Beaumont Park 3 Berrymede 13 Central 1 Derwentwater 6 John Perryn 10 Priory 5 Rothschild 4 Roman Catholic 1 Southfield 11 West Acton 2 35 Diphtheria. 11 cases were reported in 1943 in the schools, the distribution being as follows:— Berrymede 2 Central 1 Derwentwater 2 Priory 3 Rothschild 2 Roman Catholic 1 Of these cases, diagnosis was confirmed in 6 cases—none of these children had been immunised. Diagnosis of Diphtheria was not confirmed in the only immunised child notified. Percentages of Children Inoculated in School.

No treatment was required in 52 cases. 24 children obtained private treatment or refused glasses. 3 children were referred for orthoptic treatment for squint, and 2 were referred for operation. One child was referred to a partiallysighted school. The attendances have been much more satisfactory during the year. V. Brander. REPORT OF THE SCHOOL DENTAL SURGEON. During the year 1943 regular dental inspections were carried out at the Schools. The general condition of the children's teeth remains quite good, and I see no marked deterioration due to war time conditions. The teeth of nursing mothers, on the other hand, are very bad and show great neglect. The figures given below are of the work undertaken for the Maternity and Child Welfare cases, and for the pupils attending the Acton County and Junor Technical Schools. County and Technical Schools.

Tasker. SPEECH THERAPY REPORT. During the year 1943 40 children were accepted for treatment at the Priory School Speech Therapy Clinic. Of these— 7 were discharged, cured. 4 discharged, much improved. 4 left school, 3 were almost cured. 1 discharged for irregular attendance. 1 left on being transferred to Special School. Of the remainder— 13 show marked improvement. 7 made satisfactory progress. 1 made no progress. 2 have attended only a short time, and no report can be made. It has been noted that the best progress is made by those children whose mothers interest themselves personally by attending Clinic regularly and by supervising the practice of exercises home. Head and class teachers have expressed their satisfaction at the progress made. There is only one name on the waiting list at present. E. Richnell. 42 EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN.
