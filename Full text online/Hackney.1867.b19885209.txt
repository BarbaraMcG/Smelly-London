Roberts, Steam Works, 5, Hackney Road, Loxdov. 1868. SANITARY REPORT For the Year, 1867. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The report which I now have the pleasure of laying before you differs most materially from any other, as it embodies the results of the work during the first year which has elapsed since the passing of the Sanitary Act, 1866. As I pointed out to you in my last report, this Act has introduced several new provisions into sanitary work, and amongst others the necessity for making, at least once a year, an inspection of all the poorer houses in the District, which exceed 5,000 in number. Hitherto, it has been the custom to wait for complaints, unless we had good reason for believing that certain premises were in such a state as to be a nuisance and injurious to health. Amongst other new provisions are—the power for issuing regulations for limiting the number of inhabitants of houses used as lodging-houses; for the periodical cleansing, whitewashing, and repairing of the said houses; also for providing a proper water supply; and for properly paving and draining the yards. These clauses of the Act have been put into active operation, and have increased the work of the sanitary staff 4 more than threefold; so that although the staff has been largely increased, yet each member of it, especially myself, has been more fully occupied than in former years. In the appendix to the report will be found a summary of the work done in each year since 1856, as well as other tables. There are also clauses in the Act requiring the disinfection of premises in which epidemic diseases have appeared, and of all articles therein "liable to retain infection." This clause has been carried out extensively in this District with the greatest benefit, as these diseases have, since its adoption, been in nearly all cases confined to the houses in which they first broke out, instead of spreading to those adjoining. The other clause enables the Board to require the owners of property to provide increased means of ventilation, in all cases where it was deficient, by making the top window-sashes moveable. I have made particular enquiries about this, and I have invariably been informed that it has been a great boon to the poor, as they can ventilate their rooms at night, and whilst the children are in them, which they could not do before. Another new duty has been laid on the sanitary staff, especially on myself, by the superintendence of the dust contract, the distribution of cards with D on them to about 6,000 houses, and arranging the rota for the carts visiting every road, street, and court in the District once a week. There have been several other new duties to perform which do not require any special mention, but which in the aggregate have greatly increased the time required for superintending and the labour in carrying out the sanitary works. The list of streets, courts, and places inspected during the year is appended to this report, and shows that no less than 5,168 houses, 87 cow-sheds, 75 slaughter-houses, and 98 5 houses were inspected in 1867; and that 3,481 nuisances were discovered. Of these, 3,363 were found in the houses or yards, 70 in the cow-sheds, and 48 in the slaughter-houses; and in addition to these, the top window-sashes could not be let down in more than 1,000 houses. The total number of nuisances entered during the year was 5,811; and in addition, there were 1,406 accumulations of dust and refuse removed, making a total of 7,217. These 1,406 accumulations were all complained of, and an entry was made of each complaint in our books. During the first nine months of the year, 997 complaints were received and removed by the Board, at a cost of £50 15s. 0d., and the other complaints which were received during the last three months of the year were attended to by the contractor. The saving, therefore, to the District, by employing a contractor, is about £160 per annum. I consider the number of requests to remove dust to have been smaller than might have been expected during the last three months of the year, as it was notified in the cards that complaints of the non-removal of dust were to be addressed to the sanitary department; whereas previously a large number of the parishioners did not know to whom they should apply when they required their ashes and refuse to be removed. As I have always hitherto tabulated the nuisances in certain groups, I lay before you a table showing them in detail:— Nuisances removed during the Year, 1867. Privy Cesspools emptied, filled-up, and drained into the sewer 166 Privy Cesspools emptied (where there is no sewer) 59 Choked Drains cleansed and repaired, or re-laid 215 New Traps provided 628 Yards drained 350 Total number of nuisances from defective drainage, &c. 1418 6 Brought over 1418 Yards paved 508 Houses repaired, whitewashed, &c. 1217 Houses in which the ventilation was improved 1232 Houses to which a better water-supply was given 319 Total number of nuisances from defects in houses 3276 Houses disinfected 297 Houses overcrowded 207 Pigs removed 63 Stable and other refuse removed 119 Filthy places cleansed 30 Other nuisances removed 401 Total number of nuisances abated 5811 Number of houses measured under the Sanitary Act 2132 „ „ inspected „ ,, „ 5168 „ lodging-house notices served 912 „ letters sent out 467 „ Preliminary notices served 5811 „ Peremptory notices served 1264 „ Statutory notices served 962 ,, Persons summoned before Magistrates 74 „ Copies of Summonses and Orders made out 444 The total number of houses inspected under the Sanitary Act was 5,168, of which, 3,309 were found to be wanting in one or more of the requirements necessary to make a house a fit and proper place to dwell in. I think no other comment on the working of the Sanitary Act in this District is necessary. During the year there have been 41 dead bodies removed to the Mortuary. The causes of death were as follows: smallpox, 3; fever, 3; drowning, 17; newly-born, 11; accidental, 2; 7 suffocation, hanging, cut-throat, and convulsions, 1 each. The small-pox and fever cases were removed from houses in which the body must have remained in a room with the living, if there had not been a Mortuary in the District. I shall now proceed to discuss the tables which I have formed for ascertaining the birth and mortuary rates for Hackney, and of contrasting them with those for the NorthEast District and for London at large. The first table which I shall lay before you shows the number of births for each quarter of the year, in each of the sub-districts of Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, West Hackney, Hackney, and South Hackney. TABLE I. 1867.—Births in each Sub-District. Quarters. Stoke Newington Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney. Totals. First 52 34 230 374 266 956 Second 49 44 272 384 267 1016 Third ... 55 47 216 376 230 924 Fourth 53 41 223 387 259 963 Totals 209 166 941 1521 1022 3859 Per Centages Births 5.4 4.3 24.4 39.4 26.5 100 Pop. 1861 7.9 6.6 29.2 37.8 18.5 100 By this table we perceive that 3,859 births were registered during the year in the whole District; and that 209, or 5.4 per cent. were registered in Stoke Newington; 166 or 4.3 per cent. in Stamford Hill; 941 or 24.4 per cent. in West Hackney; 1521 or 39.4 per cent. in Hackney; and 1022 or 26.5 per cent. in South Hackney. On comparing the per centage of births in 1861 and 1867 with the per centage of population in 1861, we find that a very 8 great difference in the number of inhabitants must now exist as compared with 1861 in the various Sub-Districts. TABLE II. 1861 & 67.—Per Centages of Births in each Sub-District Per centages. Births. Stoke Newingtn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney.

That this variation has arisen from its population not keeping pace with some of the other districts, and not from a diminution of population, is shown by the number of births in 1861 having been 172, and in 1867, 209. A similar remark applies to the Stamford Hill sub-district, which presents a smaller per centage for 1867, viz., 4.3, than at any other period, whilst the total births have increased from 128 in 1861 to 166 in 1867. The population in West Hackney has also considerably declined; viz., from 29.8 per cent. in 1861, to 24.4 per cent. in 1867; whilst the total number of births have increased from 818 in 1861, to 941 in 1867. In Hackney the per centage is larger in 1867 than for the ten years, 1857-66, but a little below the per centage of 1861, when it was 39.7 against 39.4. The number of births has greatly increased in Hackney, having been 920 in 1857, 1093 in 1861, and no less 9 than 1521 in 1867. The greatest increase has taken place in South Hackney, as there were only 414 registered in 1857, 514 in 1861, and 1022 in 1867. We may, therefore, fairly conclude that the population of South Hackney has been nearly doubled between 1861 and 1867. Table 3 shows the number and per centage of deaths in each of the sub-districts; also, the number of deaths in each quarter. TABLE III. 1867.—Deaths in each Sub-District. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn.

The number and per centages of deaths for the year were as follows: in Stoke Newington, 115 deaths or 5.1 per cent. of the number registered in the whole of the District; in Stamford Hill, 93 or 4.1 per cent.; in West Hackney, 465 or 20.5 per cent.; in Hackney, 1094 or 48.2 per cent.; and in South Hackney, 502 or 22.1 per cent. A considerable reduction has to be made in the number registered for Hackney sub-districts, as 90 deaths occurred in the German Hospital, 131 in the East-London Union, and 113 in the Hackney Union Workhouse, making a total of 334, which should be deducted before making a comparison with other sub-districts. 10 TABLE IV.

The average number of births during this period was 157 to each 100 deaths; but in 1867 the average was no less than 170 births to each 100 deaths. The corrected death-rate for the whole of London in 1867 was 230, and for the Northern Districts 232, and for the Hackney District 210 in each 10,000 inhabitants. The proportion of births registered in all London was 365, and in Hackney 368 per 10,000 inhabitants, or 10 births to each 272 inhabitants, and 10 deaths to each 476 inhabitants of this 11 District. These statistics show that the public health of the Hackney District was decidedly better than that of the Northern Districts as a whole, and of London generally. The enormous increase in the population since 1851, when it was 58,429 against the calculated number on July 1st, 1867, of 104,882, has been provided for by the erection of at least 8,000 new houses. The population has, during this period, very much changed its character, a far larger proportion of the middle and working classes having come to reside here than previously to 1851. This change has led to a rise of the poor rates, and must lead to an increased number of deaths in proportion to the population, especially as there are now, pro rata, more children and fewer middle-aged people than heretofore.

The average of 10 years' returns for Hackney, excluding the deaths from cholera, shows that rather more than 20 per cent. of the deaths from all causes were caused by epidemic diseases; whereas, only 16½ per cent. were registered from these causes in 1867. This is usually the case during the year after a cholera outbreak, but not to so great an extent as in 1867. It is also somewhat remarkable that the deaths from tubercular diseases, including consumption, water on the brain, tubercular disease of the mesentery, and scrofula, were 20 per cent. in 1867 against an average of 16½ per cent. Diseases of the nervous system, of the heart, lungs, and stomach, &c., were less fatal than usual; whilst deaths from premature birth and debility, also from atrophy, were in excess. The deaths from epidemic and tubercular diseases, affections of the nervous system, and of the lungs, caused no less than 63½ per cent. of the total mortality. It is also worthy of remark, that the deaths from violence, including those from accidents, negligence, suicide, and murder, continue as nearly as possible at the same rate, for the average of 10 years was 34 in each 1000 deaths, and for 1867 it was 37 per 1000.

But although the aggregate number is less, yet there has been an increase in the mortality of small-pox, which, from 1857 to 1863, was almost absent from the District. This disease broke out with much violence in certain parts of the District in 1863, and again in 1866 and 1867. The only way of checking it is a regular system of early vaccination of children, and re-vaccination of adults. This, however, is not part of the duties of the Sanitary staff. Measles caused a smaller mortality than at any period since 1859, and most probably will be epidemic during 1868, as it, as well as scarlet fever, usually becomes epidemic in the year after it has produced its lowest rate of mortality. Whooping-cough was unusually prevalent and fatal, although not quite so much so as in 1866. Diarrhoea on the contrary was, after allowing for increase of population, less fatal than in any year since 1863, and a smaller number of deaths was registered from fever than in any year since 1860. This resume is exceedingly satisfactory, as it leads to a hope that the free use of disinfectants and a careful oversight of sanitary arrangements will very materially reduce the amount of sickness and death hitherto caused by epidemic diseases. We cannot hope to banish fever, scarlet fever, or measles from our District, but we should expect to modify their intensity, and check their spread amongst the inhabitants. As before stated, small-pox must be opposed by extensive and efficient vaccination, as well as by the use of disinfectants. 14 TABLE VII. Per Centages of Deaths in each Quarter, 1857 to 1867.

The excessive mortality during the first three months of the year, was co-existent with an usually cold January, warm February, and cold March. In January the thermometer went almost to Zero on the 4th, when the mean temperature was 23° below the average. This was followed by a rapid thaw for several days, and then by another severe frost. January was 4 degrees below the average; February, 6 degrees above it; March, 4 degrees below it; April, degrees, and May, ½ a degree above it; June was 1 degree below; July, 2¼ degrees below; August and September, a little above; October, 2 degrees, November, 2½ degrees, and December, 3 degrees below the average of the last 26 years. The average temperature of the year was, therefore, below the mean of the last 26 years. 15 TABLE VIII. Ages at Death in 1867. Year.

The ages at death differed in 1867 but little from the average for Hackney; but there was a slight excess of mortality in children under 1 year old, the rate having been 24.8 per cent. of the total mortality against about 24 per cent. There were 536 deaths of children under 1 year; 337 of children above 1 year and under 5 years of age; 91 between 5 and 15 years old; 127 between 15 and 25 years; 144 between 25 and 35; 184 between 35 and 45; 173 between 45 and 55; 168 between 55 and 65; 225 between 65 and 75; 204 between 75 and 85; 50 between 85 and 95; and 3 above 95 years of age. The number of deaths at 80 and above were as follows: 21 at 80 years of age; 13 at 81; 12 at 82; 9 at 83; 14 at 84; 6 at 85; 12 at 86; 8 at 87; 8 at 88; 4 at 89; 4 at 90; 5 at 91; 3 at 92; and 3 at 95. The average age at death was 33 years 7 months (of 30 days each) and 6 days. In addition to my attendances at the Board meetings, I have attended 46 meetings of the Sanitary Committee; and have submitted to them 575 orders for proceedings to be taken chiefly against owners of property to abate nuisances, or to disinfect premises. These 575 orders referred to more than 1,000 houses or premises, and included, amongst others; orders for proceedings against the owners of Goodson's dust 16 yard and Irons' dust yard, for allowing accumulations of vegetable and other refuse to be made on their premises, so as to be a nuisance. Also of Newton's wharf, for allowing black smoke to escape from the chimney of a furnace, so as to be an annoyance to the neighbours. Also against the owners of Dart's brickfield; of some land near Mount Pleasant Lane; and other places for allowing accumulations of gas-lime, and other refuse to be made thereon. Against numerous persons for keeping pigs on premises which were unfit for that purpose. Also against 256 owners of property, requiring them to remove nuisances existing on their premises; also in 245 instances for the disinfection of premises in which epidemic disease had appeared; and in 16 cases, for the abatement of overcrowding. As regards the cases of overcrowding, many were instances of indecent overcrowding, of which I subjoin a few particulars. At a house in Hedger's Grove 9 adults and 3 children lived and slept in two very small rooms. In one room, which had barely the proper cubical space for 3 adults and 1 child, there were found the father, mother, 3 daughters of 17, 16, and 12 years of age, and 3 children under 10. In the other room there were the father, mother, 2 sons of 15 and 12, and 2 children under 10 years of age. In a room in Havelock Road there slept the father, mother, a lad of 16, a girl of 15, and 3 other girls under 12 years; the proper number for the room being 4 persons. In Brook Street, Homerton, the father, mother, a daughter of 20, a son of 18, and 5 other girls under 13, slept in a room which was only large enough for 3 persons; so that each person, including children, had less than 100 cubic feet of air after allowing for the furniture in the room. At a house in Abbot street, the father, mother, 2 lads of 18 and 16, a boy of 12, and a girl of 8 years, lived and slept in a room containing 17 only 669 cubic feet, or about 100 cubic feet to each. This room was 10 feet long, 9 feet wide, and only 7 feet 4 inches high. In Warburton Place, the father, mother, a lad of 16, a girl of 14, boy of 13, and 2 children under 10 years, lived and slept in a room which contained only sufficient cubical space for 2 adults. At a house in Crozier Terrace, the father, mother, and a girl of 17 slept in the same bed. There were many other instances of indecent occupation amongst the 207 cases of overcrowding. All these overcrowding cases were discovered by inspection, and were abated by serving notices on the oecupiers of the rooms under the 19th section of the Sanitary Act, instead of on the owner under the 35th section. They were chiefly caused by the tenant letting out the apartments without the sanction of the landlord, perhaps after taking the house for themselves. I have also presented several reports to the Sanitary Committee on the dust contract, and they have taken such action thereon as they deemed advisable. In consequence of the great irregularities in carrying out the contract in that part of the District which was underlet, they advised the Board to rescind the underletting. I also laid before them several letters which I had written to various parties concerned with the Hackney Wick nuisances, and made numerous reports of the results of myinspections in that locality. I also accompanied a deputation of the Sanitary Committee to the Metropolitan Asylum Board, respecting the proposed FeVer Hospital at Homerton; and a SubCommittee in inspecting the cow-sheds and slaughter-houses preparatory to the granting of licenses by the Magistrate at Prescot Street. In addition to the above I have performed a very large amount of work in superintending the general Sanitary arrangements, and have devoted much time and consideration 18 to a study of the various Acts of Parliament bearing on Sanitary matters, and to the preparation of the forms of notices and orders now requisite for enforcing the removal of nuisances, overcrowding, &c. As before mentioned, we took out 74 summonses during 1867, and obtained no less than 71 orders from the Magistrates, so that we failed in 3 cases only. I may mention here, that the disinfection of premises in which epidemic disease broke out, was performed by Mr. Jones at least once on each premises, so as to teach the inhabitants how to use the carbolate of lime, and that a small quantity of the powder has been supplied to every person who could not afford to purchase it. I cannot conclude this report without stating that all the officers in the Sanitary department have fulfilled their duties to my entire satisfaction, and I believe, also, to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Committee. I have also to express my great regret at the death of Mr. Valentine, the chief sanitary Inspector, which took place this year. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W.
