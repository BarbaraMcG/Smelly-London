FRI 6 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1908. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Friern Barnet is situated in the London area, and is bounded on the North by East Barnet, on the East by Southgate, on the South by Hornsey, and on the West by Finchley. It comprises 1,303 acres 1 rood (including 149 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of the Colney Hatch Asylum), most of which is undulating ground, varying from 150 to 300 feet above the sea level, the geological formation being London clay, with here and there patches of gravel. The General Character of the District:—For the purposes of representation, statistics, etc., it is divided into three wards— North, South, and Central; and in addition, Colney Hatch Asylum—situated between the Central and South Wards—is treated separately to a great extent, as to include the deaths of such an institution with those of the District would create a mistaken and adverse impression. The population is unevenly distributed; thus, in the North Ward, a large part is pasture land, and the houses for the most part are of a higher rateable value, being detached and separated some distance from each other, but during the year several houses of lower rent have bean built. The houses in the Central Ward are chiefly semi-detached and in terraces and streets. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, and the houses in the neighbourhood of New Southgate Station and the South-west part, where building is in progress, being of a superior character; whilst the remainder are the usual six-roomed houses, inhabited in many cases by more than one family. In this Ward also there is the tendency to the erection of flats and the conversion of six-roomed houses into flats. 2 The population in 1881 was 4,405; in 1891, 6,716; and in 1901, 8,816; the average number of persons per house being respectively 6.01 and 5.6 for the two latter years, as estimated from figures supplied from the Census Offices by the RegistrarGeneral. Total population at all ages at Census of 1901:— District, 8,816 ; Asylum, 2,750 11,566 Number of inhabited houses 1 .633 Average number of persons per house 5.6 Houses. Wards. North. South. Central. Total. Occupied 381 828 652 1,861 Unoccupied 22 143 70 235 Births. These numbered 333, giving a birth-rate of 31.9, being an increase of 3. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 333 — 120 = 213, the excess in 1907 being 177, and in 1906 was 152. Deaths. There were 101 deaths (see Tables I., II. and IV.) registered in the District, excluding the Asylum, giving a death-rate of 9 7, an improvement of .8 on 1907, and, with the exception of 1896, the lowest rate since 1887. Nineteen deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it, giving a net total of 101 + 19 = 120, showing a net death-rate of 11.5, and producing a death-rate corrected for age and sex distribution of 12.3. Infantile Mortality.—The infantile mortality for the year 1906 was 130, and was above the average for the County of Middlesex, being almost equal to that of London (131) and England and Wales (133). In 1907 there was a noteable improvement, the rate per 1,000 births being as low as 81; this year it has risen to 99. On reference to Table V., it will be seen that of the 33 deaths 9 were due to such causes as Premature Births, 2 ; Congenital Defects, 3; Injury at Birth, 1; Want of Breast Milk, 2; Overlying, 1; 17 to more general causes, viz., Marasmus, 3; Convulsions, 5; Pneumonia, 4; Tuberculosis, 1; the remaining 7 being due to Whooping Cough, 2; Diarrhoeal Diseases, 5. Last year I drew attention to the absence of a single death from Diarrhoea, and attributed our lower infantile mortality to this 3 cause. This year other causes, with the exception of 4 deaths, have not varied, the 5 deaths from Diarrhœa being accountable for the increased mortality. The following is a table comparing the number of houses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth rate, deaths, and death-rate since 1885, giving an idea of the growth and health of the District during that period. Year. Houses. Population. Births. Birth-rate. Deaths. Death-rate. Occupied. Unoccupied. 1885 909 237 5269 157 29.7 66 12.5 1886 983 183 5496 207 37.6 68 12.3 1887 1022 106 5733 204 35.4 53 9.2 1888 1043 125 5900 207 34.8 71 11.8 1889 1076 86 6238 219 35.1 75 12.6 1890 1089 108 6507 258 39.6 94 14.4 1891 1117 84 6787 218 32.1 84 12.3 1892 1179 118 7079 191 26.9 70 11.2 1893 1216 72 7384 209 28.3 76 103 1894 1264 56 7467 206 27.5 77 10.3 1895 1277 58 7698 204 26.5 77 10 1896 1377 19 8377 213 25.4 72 8.5 1897 1388 17 8355 228 27.2 104 12.4 1898 1411 8 8668 217 25.0 85 9.8 1899 1482 10 8916 236 26.5 99 11.1 1900 1564 57 9114 248 27.2 105 11.5 1901 1558 104 8816 242 . 27.4 99 11.2 1902 1633 143 9145 270 29.5 105 11.4 1903 1686 144 9442 294 31.1 96 10.6 1904 1714 160 9758 296 30.3 103 11.7 1905 1843 150 10470 291 27.7 104 9.9 1906 1863 192 10625 291 27.4 139 11 1907 1828 258 10237 294 28.9 117 10.5 1908 1863 235 10422 333 31.9 120 9.7 The Principal Epidemic Diseases. The Zymotic Death-rate— deaths from the following infectious diseases: Smallpox, Measles, Scarlatina, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoœa, Fever (Typhus, Typhoid and Continued) was .47. This decrease was due to the entire absence of death from Diarrhoea, Enteric Fever, Croup and Measles. 4 The principal Epidemic Diseases Death-rate in previous years was:— 1884 2.1 1892 1.0 1900 0.5 1885 1.2 1893 2.3 1901 1.8 1886 2.7 1894 1.6 1902 1.4 1887 0.8 1895 0.9 1903 1.4 1888 1.5 1896 1.5 1904 1.1 1889 0.7 1897 2.5 1905 1.0 1890 1.6 1898 1.9 1906 1.5 1891 1.5 1899 2.5 1907 0.58 Infectious Diseases and the Means taken to Prevent their Spread. It will be seen from Table III. that (excluding the Asylum) 122 Notification Certificates of Infectious Diseases were received, as compared with 50 in 1906 and 78 in 1907. The increase was due to the large number of notifications of Scarlet Fever and to a less extent of Diphtheria. On receipt of information respecting infectious cases the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given and explained, disinfectants are supplied, and the schools attended, in the case of children, and their employers in the case of adults, notified. Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and where accepted is carried out, subject to beds being obtained. After recovery or removal of an infectious case, disinfection of the room or rooms occupied is performed by means of sulphur and formalin. Cleansing and stripping notices are served where necessary. Clothes, bedding, etc., are removed to Finchley, where they are put through the steam disinfector. Antitoxin is supplied free to medical men for use in cases occurring in the District. Supplies of Antitoxin are kept at the Council Chambers in the Central Ward, and at the residence of the Medical Officer of Health in the North Ward. Medical men have availed themselves of this serum, both for acute cases and as a preventive. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year the application of this process has been much extended for diagnostic purposes, and has been much appreciated. 5 Isolation Hospital. The District is without any separate provision for Isolation accommodation, and relies on being able to procure beds in Hospitals of neighbouring Authorities, viz., Enfield, Southgate, and Hendon. I am glad to be able to report that definite arrangements have been almost concluded with the Southgate Authority for the accommodation of Friern Barnet patients. Scarlet Fever. This disease, which was so prevalent during the latter part of 1907, has continued into the present year, and, on reference to the Table of Infectious Diseases, it will be seen there was a recrudescence in January which was maintained until the end of April, when there was an abatement, followed by a reappearance in September and a decline to two cases only in December. It was not possible to trace any particular source of infection in many of the cases, but in the instance of the small outbreak in the Avenue early in September, it would appear that the first case was a boy, who was sent home from school on account of his dirty condition, and was later found to be in the peeling stage of Scarlet Fever. This boy infected a series of 11 cases. The whole being removed to Hospital promptly, the disease in this area subsided. Of the 89 cases that occurred, 3 were in the North, 59 in the South, and 27 in the Central Wards. Of the total number, 64 were removed to Hospital. There were two deaths. Diphtheria. There have been 19 cases during the year, being two more than in 1907. In the first six months of the year there were six cases, 1 in January, 2 in February, 3 in May. The months of June, July, August, and September were entirely free from the disease. During October there were 3 cases, in November 4, and in December 6, all before the 21st. It will be noticed (see Table III.) that 13 of the cases were aged 5 to 15, the school age. In connection with this, of the 6 cases in December 3 attended one school and 1 attended another school of adjoining Districts; of the other 2 cases, 1 was too young and the other too old to attend school. I was unable to discover any common cause of the outbreak. 6 Diarrhœa. There were no deaths from this disease, although there were four from allied diseases. Tuberculosis. There were 10 deaths from Tuberculosis, 7 from Phthisis (Consumption), and 3 from other tuberculous diseases. In each case, as formerly, that has come under my notice infectiousness of the disease has been explained, and disinfectants and leaflets supplied. Disinfection after removal and fatal cases has been offered, and has been generally readily accepted. In the Asylum there were 17 deaths, which is an improvement. The figures are given below for previous years. Isolation is now carried out in the Asylum, as far as possible, for Phthisical patients. 1892 16 1897 9 1902 42 1893 16 1898 13 1903 56 1894 12 1899 14 1904 38 1895 6 1900 32 1905 20 1896 19 1901 24 1906 35 1907 35 Influenza. This disease has been prevalent in the district, both at the beginning and latter end of the year ; in the former being marked by heart, and in the latter by abdominal symptoms. Typhoid. No cases were notified during the year. A case in the convalescent stage came into the district to stay with relations in the North Ward. The patient was kept under observation and every precaution was taken, with the result that no further cases developed. Chicken-pox . has been almost absent from the District. Measles. The District has been comparatively free from this disease. This disease was removed from the list of Notifiable Diseases in 1900. 7 The number of cases for previous years were— 1897 273 1901 292 1898 142 1902 186 1899 19 1903 150 1900 15 1904 90 Whooping Cough has only been very slightly noticeable in the District. There were two deaths, one in the North and one in the South Wards. Cerebro-Spinal Disease. This was added to the list of Notifiable Diseases in June, 1907. Table of Infectious Diseases.

One case was notified, and the case proved fatal. It is doubtful as to whether this case should be considered under this heading, the history of the case being that the mother had, a month previously, nursed another child suffering from Scarlet Fever, and had been ailing subsequently. At the confinement and afterwards there were no symptoms of any pelvic complications. The infant developed Scarlet Fever. Schools. 1, All Saints'; 2, St. John's ; 3, Friern Lane; 4, St. Paul's; 5, St. Peter's; 6 and 7, Middlesex County Schools (1, Sidney Road ; 2, Holly Park). 8 All these seven schools have been frequently inspected, and have been found to be in good order. Weekly lists of absentees are forwarded to me by the School Head on request, and at shorter periods during epidemics. Disinfectants are supplied for use in the lavatories and urinals, and also to be added to the water with which the slates, desks and floors are washed. The Middlesex Holly Park County School was opened dnring the year. Slaughter-houses. There are two in the District which have been brought and are kept as up to date as possible They have been regularlyvisited, and have been found clean. One conviction for slaughtering animals on unlicensed premises was obtained. Cowshed, Dairies, and Milk-shops. A list of these will be found under the scheme at the end of the report. I have again frequently inspected and carefully impressed upon the Owners and Managers of Dairies the importance of keeping milk clean and cool, and have suggested the grooming of the cows and the provision of proper overalls and washing facilities for the milkers. Milk Supply and Control of Tuberculosis. I have reported during the year to your Authority upon the power that exists with regard to obtaining as pure a supply as possible, and advocated the appointment of a Veterinary Suigeon to inspect the cows from time to time, and the possible use of the Tuberculin test. It was decided to take no action. Adulteration of Food. As in former years, considerable attention has been given to this subject. Small general shops, confectioners, and ice-cream vendors have received particular supervision. The carcase of one pig was seized and condemned on account of Tuberculosis. Inland Revenue Act. I have again been requested to inspect several premises under this Act, and have found the following provisions for food—a wooden cupboard, ventilated by communicating with the external air by two air-bricks, but opening directly into the small back addition, about 8ft. by 8ft., built in some cases of wood with a glass roof on a south aspect, and containing a copper, gas cooking stove, and sink. 9 I have inspected Bawtry Road, Sutton Road, Sydney Terrace, The Avenue, Holmsdale Road, and Oakleigh Road. Legislation. The following Acts of Parliament, Bye-laws and Regulations pre in force in your District:— Public Health Act, 1875. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, 1893, Part I. and Part II. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890. Infectious Diseases Prevention Acts, 1890. Infectious Diseases Notifications, 1889, 1890. Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act. Dairies, Cowshed?, and Milk-shops Order, 1885. Isolation Hospital Act, 1893. Factory and Workshop Acts, 1878, 1883, 1891, 1895, and 1905. Allotments Act. Slaughterhouses. Cleansing, etc., and Removal of Refuse. Houses let in Lodgings. Public Mortuaries. Prevention of Nuisances (bye-laws, approved by L.G.B., 1884). Keeping of Animals Bye-laws, approved by L.G.B., 1884. New Streets and Buildings Bye-laws, approved by L.G.B., May, 1903. Open Spaces, jointly with East Barnet Valley and Southgate District Councils. Communications with Drains and Sewers. Customs and Revenue Acts, 1890, 1891. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, contains— Notification of Births Act. This measure was again before your Council, when it was decided to adopt it. A scheme was drawn up to carry out the Act. The District being divided according to the Wards, North, South and Central, and a voluntary visitor appointed by the Authority to each Ward. Printed and stamped notification cards, explaining the working of the Act, are supplied to the medical men, midwives, and visitors, ready to be filled in and returned to the Medical Officer of Health. A leaflet of "Hints to Mothers" is also sent. No action arose under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. 10 Disposal of Sewage. Situation of the Works.—The Sewage Works are situated on the South Side of the District (in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brook, into which the effluent flows. The original works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M.Inst C.E., and were executed under his direction. The working of the tanks and original filters has been altered and improved, and three Contact Beds have been constructed under the supervision of Mr. E. J. Reynolds, Assoc. M. Inst.C.E. Further additions are contemplated as mentioned below. The method of treatment is as follows:— The Sewage, which enters the works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton lime, equal to four grains per gallon, is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. It then receives alumino-ferric to the extent of one grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing through a salmon ladder, and in this condition it flows into settling tanks, of which, there are four, each having a capacity of 70,000 gallons. These tanks are divided by concrete walls, on which is an open channel divided by sluice doors, so that either one, two, three or four tanks can be worked at a time or alternately, as required. The overflow from the tanks first passes out of the tanks into an open channel, then on to first Contact Beds, and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. During the past year employment for local labour was found by commencing the construction of two additional filters and one settling tank at the Sewage Works. The filter will be constructed somewhat similarly to the present ones, the media being principally burnt ballast, obtained by burning the excavated clay with the top layer of sand soil. The additional settling tank will be six feet wider than those already constructed. These filters and tanks have long been needed. The provisional sanction of the L.G.B. for a loan for this work has been obtained, and the work is nearing an end. The Engineer and Surveyor has had a portion of the land used for sludge disposal laid out in lagoons, and the sludge is run into these in turn. 11 Samples of sewage effluent water have been taken from time to time by the M.C.C. and the Lee Conservancy, the control samples of which have been analysed by Professor Kenwood with most satisfactory results. I would advocate that the planting of trees round these works should be continued, as suggested by the Engineer and Surveyor. The roads in this District have separate Sewers for storm water, and all houses except the older ones have the dual system of drainage. An endeavour is being made to carry the storm water from the old houses into the Surface-water Sewers, as opportunities occur. This is very necessary, as everything should be done to make the flow of sewage at any Sewage Works as uniform as possible. The sewage from the Avenue and Ely Place section of the District has to be pumped to the Sewage Works, and in this case any rain water admitted to the sewers greatly increases the cost of lifting the sewage to the gravitation sewers. The sewerage system of the Avenue District has received particular attention. Sewers have been laid in Pollard Road, Ivy Avenue, St. John's Avenue (Hollyfield Estate), Ashhurst Road (White House Estate), Chandos Avenue (Oakleigh Park Estate), etc. Surface-water sewers have also been laid in Friern Lane and along the Friern Barnet Road. A commencement has been made of laying sewers for new roads on the Bethune Park Estate, north of the Holly and Southgate Parks. Ambulance. This District does not yet possess an Ambulance, but satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Finchley District Council for the hire of their conveyance. Mortuary. The Finchley District Council have an excellent Mortuary a short distance from Friern Barnet's West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Coroner's Inquests. The large room on the West side of the Council Offices has been fitted up for Coroner's Inquests, and during the year a number of Finchley and Friern Barnet inquests have been held 12 there. The Council Offices being near the Finchley Mortuary, this room has been found convenient for holding the Finchley inquests. Formerly, the inquests were held at public-houses. Dust Disposal and Removal. This is undertaken by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The collection is made weekly, and the dust removed in covered vans. Notices are served, as required, to provide portable circular sanitary dust-bins in place of worn-out or insanitary bins. The refuse is chiefly taken to the Sewage Works, but the Engineer and Surveyor has again been instructed to report as to the provision of a Refuse Destructor. M.C.C. Light Railways. Owing to differences as to the mode of construction of the proposed light railways along the Friern Barnet Road and the Woodhouse Road, the Council, with the adjoining Councils, went to arbitration with the M.C.C. After several days' hearing, which involved a heavy cost, an agreement satisfactory to this Council was arrived at. The M.C.C. agreed to pave the track and in front of the schools and places of worship with wood paving in place of granite setts, and provide surface-water drainage, etc. The work of laying the track was commenced in the summer. The whole of the road has been widened to fifty feet and it is expected that the trams will be running at an early date The Board of Trade have extended the time allowed for the construction of these lines. The dangerous steps and paving in front of the shops between Beaconsfield Road and the Great Northern Railway has been replaced with Patent Victoria Stone, an improvement much appreciated. The levels of the roadway have also been improved in many places, and means of quick removal of surface-water provided. The Engineer and Surveyor reports that, on the whole, the M.C.C. have met the demands of this Council very reasonably while the work was being carried out. The agreements for widening the G. N.R. Bridge will shortly be completed. A petition is being prepared asking for a Light Railway to be constructed from Muswell Hill, down Colney Hatch Lane, up to these Offices at the junction of Colney Hatch Lane and the Friern Barnet Road. This would undoubtedly be of great assistance to the Southern portion of the District. 13 Public Improvements. Patent Victoria Stone has been laid in several roads, including the top of Bellevue Road and Oakleigh Road North. The usual tar-paving repairs have been carried out. Land has been given up to widen the highway in the Friern Barnet Road by the corner of Colney Hatch Lane, Oakleigh Road South and North, and in Friern Lane for a length of 750 feet. Kerb arid channel has been laid in the Colney Hatch Lane by the land given up by the L.C.C. Asylums Committee. Athenæum Road (Private Road). The entrance and a portion of this road have been widened to 45 feet. New Roads.—The owners of the various estates have made up roads called—St. John's Avenue, Ivy Avenue, Ashurst Road, Pollard Road, Chandos Avenue (part of), etc. The contractors are now engaged in making roads on the Bethune Park Estate. Lighting. The all-night system of lighting the lamps by means of automatic clockwork controllers has been much extended during the year. Private Streets.—Stanley Road, Crown Road, Hampden Road from Colney Hatch Lane to Pembroke Road have been made up under the 150th Section of the P.H. Act. The Council are considering the advisability of serving notices to make up, etc., Alma Road, Bawtry Road, Torrington Park, Oakleigh Road, N., St. John's Avenue, etc. The Council have been trying to arrange with the Wood Green Council to jointly make up part of the Alexandra Road, and it is hoped some steps may bo taken shortly, as the road is in a bad state. Fire Brigade. A retained Fire Brigade of twelve members has been formed, and much interest is taken in their work. Three fire stations have been provided, one in each Ward, and the necessary equipment obtained. Telephonic communication between the stations has been provided, and arrangements made with H.M. Postmaster-General for the Bell Alarms to be fixed in each of the Firemen's houses. 14 Tree Planting. Additional trees were planted, as usual, the owners and occupiers of the roads in cases subscribing towards the cost of the trees. Vent Columns. Further Vent Columns have been fixed on the Sewers, and in several cases the existing ones have been heightened. Road from tub Avenue. An agreement has been entered into with the G.N. Railway Company to purchase the land necessary to carry a road through from the Avenue into Oakleigh Road South. This will be a great improvement, as it will do away with a cul-de sac in a poor District. Water Supply. The whole of the District has a constant supply from the Barnet Water Co. Recreation Ground and Open Space. This ground, held in common with East Barnet and Southgate Authorities, is situated on the East boundary of the District. Dust Prevention. The Surveyor and Engineer has carried out the watering of the whole of the roads, together with washing of the footpaths of the poorer streets with water containing disinfectant. 15 Meteorology.
