HEALTH LECTURES AND FILM DISPLAYS The following is a list of lectures and film displays given during the year:— Schools 41 attended by 8,340 Youth Organisations 42 „ 2,545 206 17,080 Propaganda work has been carried on during 1947 in a manner similar to that of previous years, the scheme for reaching the populace being such, that almost every organisation, holding meetings in the borough, is given a film display or lecture at least once a month throughout the year. In addition to schools, youth clubs, adult clubs, political groups, co-operative guilds, women's meetings and church guilds are visited in turn, their leaders being anxious to co-operate in arranging dates. By arrangement with the local branch of the British Medical Association, a film dealing with anterior poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) was shown at St. Giles Hospital, Camberwell, during the epidemic of August and September. The subject of the film was introduced by Dr. Banks, Medical Superintendent of Park Hospital, and general practitioners, numbering about 120 from Bermondsey, Southwark, Deptford and Camberwell, were present. In the earlier part of the year, a series of sex education talks were arranged for adolescents at youth clubs. These talks were given by a lecturer from the Central Council for Health Education and films were shown by this department. CITZENSHIP Once again, head teachers of senior schools availed themselves of the facilities offered for introducing " last term " children to the subject of Local Government. In an attempt to assist in preparing senior children to become good citizens, arrangements are made for groups of children to visit suitable departments of the Council and to listen to talks with film illustrations. As the raising of the schoolleaving age came into effect during the year, it was not until the Adult Organisations 125 ,, 6,195 autumn term that visits were resumed, when 52 children made 36 visits arranged as follows: — Girls to a day nursery and an infant welfare centre during a morning or afternoon, two attending at each session. Boys to the Central Baths where they were shown the plant, machinery and working of the baths and laundries. Girls and boys to the Bacteriological Laboratory and Disinfecting Station with a talk on " Keeping the Borough Healthy." Girls and boys to the Public Health Centre where they learned more about the health services of the borough. Girls and boys to the Propaganda Office for a talk on " Local Government and how it works," illustrated by a film. Inspection of the Council Chamber, Committee Rooms, Mayor's Parlour, etc., were included in these visits. That much valuable information is gained by the children is evident from the fact that essays written, by them at school after the course, show a good grasp of the subject. ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGN During 1947, assistance was again given to the Road Safety Sub- Committee. Films on road safety have been shown at many of the meetings arranged for health film displays as well as those arranged specifically for road safety propaganda. Lantern slides and photographic prints have been made as required. Lectures and film displays were as follows: — Schools Other organisations 4 „ 280 14 10 attended by 2,300 2,580 IX.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION HOUSING.
