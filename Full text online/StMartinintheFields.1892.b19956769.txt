GREEN STREET IMPROVEMENT. On the 28th July. 1892, the London County Council’s valuation of the surplus land at Nos. 1, Green Street, and 31, Leicester Square, was considered, and it was suggested that in the first instance it would be desirable to offer the land to the freeholder. The Vestry, however, resolved to retain the land for the purpose of planting it with shrubs or otherwise, as might be afterwards determined upon. On the same date, it was resolved to request the Council to state whether they intended to include the completion of the improvement in any Hill of next Session. The Council having stated that they had not decided to include the improvement in any bill, it was determined on the 11th August, 1892, to forward a strong letter of remonstrance to the Council. On the 6th October, 1892, a proposal was made by Mr. W. Emden to pull down Nos. 7 and 8, Green Street, and 9, Charing Cross Road, and to give up the land required for further widening in exchange for the Vestry's surplus land at Nos. 4, 5, and 6. On the 15th December, 1892, the Vestry considered a draft Agreement, prepared by the Solicitors, for mutual conveyances and otherwise, relative to Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, Green Street, and 9, Charing Cross Road, when it was resolved to instruct the Solicitors to report as to whether they had satisfied themselves that the offer was a bona fide one. On the 12th January, 1893, a letter was considered from the Solicitors, stating' that Mr. Emden required the sum of £1,600 to be paid to him in the proposed exchange of land in Green Street, that his principal is Mr. Charles Wilmot, and forwarding copies of 14 Green street improvement—continued. correspondence between themselves and Mr. Emden generally on the subject, whereupon the Vestry decided to instruct the Solicitors to take no further action thereon. On the 9th February, 1893, a letter was received from Mr. Emden stating he thought he could then deal with the exchange of land in a manner satisfactory to all parties, the letter was thereupon referred to the Improvements Committee for consideration. On the 23rd February, 1893, it was reported that £13,200 had then been expended in acquiring the interest in the properties acquired, and it was determined to request the Council to pay their promised contribution of £6,750 to avoid further payment of interest by the Vestry. This, however, the Council subsequently declined to do. On the 23rd March, 1893, it was agreed, subject to certain conditions, to enter into an agreement with Mr. Emden for the mutual conveyances and otherwise referred to above, and he was requested to complete the improvement within three months from the sealing of the agreement. LAVATORIES, &c., CLEARING CROSS. The Local Government Board having, as the result of the local enquiry held by them, decided to comply with the Vestry's application for consent to borrow £4,000, the Board's formal consent under seal was received on the 7th April, 1892, and was duly forwarded to the London County Council. On the 2nd June, 1892, the offer of the London County Council to advance the sum of £4,000, to be repaid within 25 years, was accepted, and the mortgage for that amount was subsequently completed. CAMDEN TOWN CEMETERY ACT, 1854. On the 15th December, 1892, Major Clifford Probyn was appointed a Trustee under the above Act. 15 ELECTRIC LIGHTING. A motion having been made on the 2nd June, 1892, that a portion of the Parish should be experimentally lighted by electricity, it was Agreed to further consider the subject at the expiration of a period of 6 months. It was subsequently resolved to appoint a Committee for the purpose of oonsidering relative to the desirability of the Vestry lighting the public lamps and supplying electric current for domestic purposes and for motive power within the parish. CECIL AND SALISBURY STREETS. The order for closing the above streets was made on the 9th May, 1892. HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION. On the 6th October, 1892, the Health Committee reported that they had instructed the Clerk to prepare a notice to be forwarded to occupiers railing' attention to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and stating it to be the intention of the Vestry to make an inspection of all the houses and premises in the parish. The Vestry subsequently temporarily appointed three properly qualified Sanitary inspectors to carry out the work. » On the 23rd March, 1893, it was reported that 1,066 houses had been inspected, in 793 of which defects had been found, but in most cases they were only of a minor character. INSPECTION OF WORKSHOPS. On the 9th February, 1893, a letter was received from the London County Council forwarding a report of their Medical Officer as to the results of inspection of workshops in Mile End Old J own, Whitechapel, St. George-in-the-East, Bethnal Green, and the Strand, and intimating that in the event of the local authorities not enforcing the law the Council might feel itself called upon to take action under sections 100 and 101 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In reply the Council were informed that the subject would receive attention. 16 ASIATIC CHOLERA. On the 30th August, 1892, a Special Meeting of the Vestry was convened for the purpose of considering communications from the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the London Central Sick, Asylum District, with reference to precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and a Special Vigilance Committee was appointed with authorisation to expend a sum not exceeding £100, in taking all necessary precautions. The cost of the works ordered was at the rate of £34 per week for 3½ weeks, and this was subsequently reduced by dispensing with Sunday work, and by flushing pipe sewers less frequently. On the 22nd September, a report of the Committee, relative to the accommodation available for patients, and the precautions taken for disinfection, was submitted to the Vestry, and the Committee's proceedings were approved. On the 6th October, 1892, the Health Committee reported that they had given instructions for the flushing of all courts and alleys once a week, and the sweeping of the same every day until further ordered, and had instructed the Medical Officer to report relative to the courts, &c., requiring special attention, and that they had requested the Medical Officer to prepare a handbill to be circulated in the parish immediately upon the outbreak of any form of epidemic disease. A letter was received on the 6th October, 1892, from the Secretary of the Charing Cross Hospital stating the Authorities would be prepared to allot to this parish 10 beds for male and 5 for female patients suffering from cholera, subject to 24 hours' requisition. On the 20th October, 1892, the following list of Courts, &c., requiring special attention was submitted, viz., Bedfordbury and courts leading there from; Little Catherine Street, Long Acre, and courts leading therefrom (more particularly upon market days); New Street, Red Lien Court, Russell Court, Russell Street, St. Martin’s Court, Vine??? Yard, White Hart Street, and York Place, and on the 3rd November, 1892, instructions were given to the Surveyor thereon. 17 Asiatic Cholera — continued. On the 17th November, 1892, a circular letter was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, forwarding a map showing the various places in London where accommodation for cholera cases had recently been placed at their disposal. On the 9th February, 1893, a letter was considered from the London County Council, enquiring— (a) What provision of hospitals and refuges could be made by the Vestry in case of an outbreak of cholera? (b) Into what areas the parish would be divided for the purpose of the visitation of poorer houses? (c) What arrangements would be made for disinfection, the destruction of infected articles, the burial of the dead, and generally what steps have been taken upon the letter of the Local Government Board of the 25th August last. And in reply the Council were informed that an inspection of the drainage of all houses in the parish was being made, and that 3 additional Sanitary Inspectors had been temporarily appointed for that purpose; that the accommodation available for cholera patients at King's College Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital, St. Thomas's Hospital, Cleveland Street Intirmary and Bear Yard Casual Wards amounted to 165 beds, and further accommodation would be obtained if necessary; that the areas would be defined when the necessity arose, and that ample provision had always been made for the disinfection and the destruction of infected articles. On the 9th February, 1893, a letter was considered from the Metropolitan Asylums Board enquiring where ambulance litters could be stationed to deal with a possible ??? break of cholera, whereupon they were informed the Town Hall, ??? Lane Garden, and Charing Cross Hospital would be convenient f??? at purpose. B 18 TRAFALGAR SQUARE. Attention having been called to a decision of the Home Secretary, permitting meetings to be held in the Square on Saturday afternoons, Sundays and Bank Holidays, he was requested to receive a deputation from the Vestry on the subject, which request was acceded to; on the 20th October, 1892, the following resolution was passed:— “Resolved unanimously—That the Home Secretary be informed the Vestry much regret he should have decided the question before hearing the views of the deputation he had expressed his readiness to receive, and he be further informed that under the circumstances the Vestry feel it will be unnecessary to avail themselves of the opportunity they sought in order that he might be informed as to the views of the parishioners.” TRADE REFUSE. There having arisen a difference bet ween Messrs. A. and S. Gatti and the Vestry relative to the removal of refuse, it was agreed on the 12th January, 1893, in order to avoid legal proceedings, to refer the subject to Mr. Fladgate on behalf of Messrs. Gatti, and to Mr. Preston (a member of the firm) on behalf of the Vestry, to submit their views to a third Solicitor, in order that he might state a case for the Opinion of Counsel; and it was agreed that such opinion when given should be binding upon the Vestry and Messrs. Gatti for a period to be determined upon, or until further legislation more clearly defining the term “trade refuse” should have taken place. It was afterwards determined that Mr. Fladgate and Mr. Preston should each instruct a separate Counsel, so that both parties would have their interests separately urged before an Arbitrator; subsequently, however, the Solicitors were instructed to stay proceedings in reference to the arbitration, pending receipt of a report from the Works Committee upon the subject. On the 26th January, 1893, a letter was received from the Solicitors, reporting that at Bow Street Police Court, on the 19th inst., at the hearing of a summons against the Vestry for the non-removal of refuse from Drury Lane Theatre, Sir J. Bridge had Vestry, and suggesting the carrying of the case to a higher Court, and generally advising thereon. The Vestry, however, decided to take no further action. 19 MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION AND CORONER'S COURTS. The London County Council having suggested that this parish should combine with the parish of St. James’ and the Strand District Board in providing the above accommodation together with separate rooms for post-mortem examination and infectious cases, it was resolved that the Council be informed that as the Vestry have provided a mortuary in Drury Lane and another under the Parish Churchyard and have made provision for the holding of post-mortem examinations, and the Council have themselves entered into an agreement for the holding of Coroner's Courts at the Vestry Hall, the Vestry are of opinion that so far as this parish is concerned sufficient provision has already been made. On the 20th October, 1892, a letter was received from the St. James’ Vestry stating they had appointed a Committee of nine members for the purpose of conferring with this Vestry and the Strand District Hoard relative to the suggestion made by the London County Council, and requesting this Vestry to appoint a small Committee take part in a conference, whereupon Messrs. de Coverly, George, Hill, Laing, Lee, Turner, and Walker were so appointed. The conference was duly held and the delegates of the parishes subsequently conferred with a Committee of the Council. On the 1st December, 1892. Mr. Churchwarden Prescott reported that, by request, he and the Medical Officer of Health had met the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department of the County Council, and their Medical Officer, at the Mortuaries under the Parish Churchyard and Drury Lane Garden, for the purpose of inspecting the same, and he (Mr. Prescott) having stated what works it was considered should be effected in order to meet the requirements of the Council, the subject was referred to the Health Committee for consideration. Subsequently, plans for alterations and additions to the Mortuary under the Churchyard were ordered to be forwarded to the Council, and they were requested to state whether they required separate provision to be made for infectious cases, their attention being called to the accommodation in Drury Lane for the reception of such cases. B 2 20 Mortuary accommodation and coroner’s courts—continued. Suggestions having been made by the Council’s committee relative to the obtaining of more light in the Churchyard Mortuary, the insertion of glazed white tiles and prismatic lights, they intimated that in view of the assurance that infectious cases were not received there they did not require separate provision for such cases to be made. Instructions were thereupon given for the embodiment of the suggestions, and an amended plan and estimate were afterwards submitted (the estimated cost being £600) and ordered to be forwarded to the Council. TEMPORARY SHELTER. On the 6th October, 1892, the Health Committee reported that they had instructed the Clerk to enquire of neighbouring parishes what, if any, arrangements had been made by them for providing temporary shelter for persons who had been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of disinfection. On the 20th October letters were received from St. James' Vestry, stating they had instructed their Medical Officer to make arrangements in each case for the temporary shelter of persons dislodged for the disinfection of their rooms; and from Westminster Vestry stating they had had for some years a set of 6 furnished rooms for the like purpose, whereupon it was determined to enquire of the Strand District Board as to whether they would co-operate with the Vestry in providing the required accommodation. On the lath December, 1892, the Clerk having reported that the Surveyor to the Strand District Board had conferred with him and the Vestry's Surveyor relative to the proposed co-operation and the Health Committee, upon further consideration, being of opinion that such a course would be undesirable, reported that they had enquired of the Strand Union Guardians as to whether they would be able to let such rooms as might be necessary upon the Vestry paying an annual rent for the accommodation. A letter was subsequently received from the Guardians stating that they regretted not to be able to afford the required accommodation. 21 SLOP AND DUST COLLECTING. &c. The Surveyor having, on the 28th July, 1892, submitted a statement of the cost of the above works for the past three years, it was resolved to continue the system for a period of 12 months' he being instructed to execute the works as economically as practicable, having regard to efficiency. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. A scheme for dealing with the Turner's Court and Lemon Tree Yard areas, and an extended scheme for the acquisition, in addition, of premises abutting upon Taylor's Buildings, were on the 30th June, 1892, ordered to be forwarded to the London County Council, a suggestion being made that the ground floors of the premises to be erected in Bedfordbury should be used as shops. On the 1st December, 1892, a letter from the London County Council's Housing, &c., Committee was considered, indicating two methods of dealing with the Turner's Court area, and stating they were not prepared to approve of the acquisition of the expensive business premises in Lemon Tree Yard and Taylor's Buildings, but if the Vestry would submit a scheme under sec. 39 of the Act, providing for the clearance of Turner's Court on the basis of a contribution being made by the Council towards the cost, the Committee would be prepared to consider it, whereupon the Council's Committee were informed the Vestry were of opinion the Scheme suggested was inadequate, inasmuch as it did not provide for the re-housing of persons displaced, the Council's Committee were further informed that the Vestry adhered to their opinion that in any Scheme the acquisition, at least, of the buildings in Lemon Tree Yard would be desirable, and it was suggested that the Vestry's Committee would confer again with the Council’s Committee if they so desired. On the 26th January, 1893, the Vestry considered a letter from the Loudon County Council's Committee stating they were still of opinion it would be undesirable to include the premises in Lemon Tree Yard as they are not insanitary, and their acquisition would add materially to the cost of the scheme, and that unless the Vestry 22 Housing of the working classes act, 1890—continued. could see their way to omit the property they (the Committee) regretted they would be unable to recommend the Council to contribute towards the cost of the scheme, whereupon the Vestry resolved not to adopt the scheme proposed by the Council's Committee. On the same day the Vestry's Committee submitted the following alternative courses for consideration, viz.:— (a) The purchase by Agreement of the properties required. (b) The preparation of a scheme and the application to the Local Government Board for their order thereon, in which case the properties could be acquired under compulsory powers. (c) The effecting of the improvement by the Council in default of its being carried out by the Vestry, in which case the Council could apply to a Secretary of State to make an order on the Vestry to contribute towards the cost of the improvement. Whereupon it was agreed to inform the Council's Committee that the Vestry were still of opinion that the acquisition of premises in Lemon Tree Yard was the only practical method of effecting the improvement, and the Vestry hoped the Committee would reconsider the question, and if they thought desirable, receive a deputation from the Vestry's Committee for the purpose of further discussing the subject. On the 9th March, 1893, a letter was received from the Council's Committee, stating, as they were unable to depart from their decision that it would be undesirable to include Lemon Tree Yard in the Turner's Court area, they did not think seeing a deputation from the Vestry would serve any useful purpose; whereupon they were informed that as the Vestry felt themselves unable to depart from their decision with reference to the inclusion of Lemon Tree Yard, the Vestry considered that, under the circumstances, any further discussion of the subject was unnecessary, and they did not feel it incumbent upon them to take any further action thereon. 23 LABOUR BUREAU. On the suggestion of the Loudon Trades Council, a Labour Bureau was opened on the 30th November, 1892, but although many applications for employment were registered, the Vestry, except in one instance, were unable to obtain employers. Upon investigation it was found that about 20 percent. of the persons registering were not known at the addresses given. On the 1st December, 1892, a letter was received from the Local Government Board calling attention to the distress occasioned by scarcity of employment, and suggesting methods for employing the unemployed, when it was ordered that the receipt of the letter be acknowledged. On the 12th January, 1893, it was resolved to offer employment to those who had registered who were willing to sweep the streets, and a number of men were so employed for several weeks. DISORDERLY HOUSES. On the 17th November, 1892, the Vestry consented to the Overseers of the Pcor paying the sum of £174 1s. 3d. in respect of taxed costs incurred in prosecuting certain keepers of disorderly houses in the Parish. LAMPS (unauthorised affixing of). * The Vestry having taken Counsel's Opinion relative to the affixing of a certain lamp without previous permission, it was resolved on the loth December, 1892, to forward a copy of the Case and Opinion to the London County Council, to call their attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the enactments now in force, and to request them to insert in one of their Various Powers Bills a clause to enable local authorities to regulate projections, and the Vestries and District Boards were invited to support the request. 24 QUEEN'S WESTMINSTER VOLUNTEERS (I COMPANY). On the 22nd September, 1892, an application was received that a box containing papers, &c., relating to the St. Martin’s Company in the custody of the Vestry, might be delivered to the Company; it was then determined that upon the Colonel of the Regiment making a written application the box would be placed in his hands. The box was subsequently delivered. THE LATE RT. HON. W. H. SMITH, M.P. The Memorial Committee having reported, on the 19th May, 1892, that the bust of the deceased Statesman would shortly be completed; it was agreed to request the Sculptor, Mr. T. R. Essex, to execute a marble bracket, and to place the bust thereon in a position in the Great Hall to be selected by the Committee. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. On the 20th October, 1892, it was resolved, that Mr. John Joseph Skegg, L.R.C.P.E., M.R.C.S., of 29, Craven Street, be provisionally appointed the Medical Officer of Health of the Parish, to perform the duties prescribed in the Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891, over the whole area of the parish. On the 17th November, 1892, the formal sanction of the Local Government Board to the appointment was submitted. SANITARY INSPECTOR. the 6th October, 1893, Mr. William Cooke was provisionally appointed the Sanitary Inspector of the parish, to perform the duties prescribed in the Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891, over the hole area of the parish, for a period of one year, from the 6th day October, 1892. The appointment was subsequently formally approved by the Local Government Board. 25 SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. Samples (22 in all) of Coffee, Sugar, Pepper, Milk, Butter, Whiskey, Porter and Ale have been taken for the purpose of analysis during the year, and in all cases, except one, the samples were certified to be genuine. In the excepted case the vendor was cautioned to exercise more care in the future that legal proceedings against him might be avoided, to which he replied that he was taking every precaution to prevent inferior milk being supplied from his shop. CHURCHWARDENS AND SIDESMEN. On the 21st April, 1892, Mr. Thomas Prescott and Mr. Thomas Proctor Baptie, J.P., were respectively elected Senior and Junior Churchwardens, and Messrs. Henry Grant and Walter Lewin, Sidesmen to the Senior Churchwarden, and Messrs. William Stephens Cross and Frederick Charles Bayley, Sidesmen to the Junior Churchwarden. CHURCHWARDEN THE RT. HON. LORD KINNAIRD. On the 2nd June, 1892, a vote of thanks was passed to the Rt. Hon. Lord Kinnaird for the efficient manner in which he had discharged the duties of Churchwarden for the past two years. MR. CHURCHWARDEN PRESCOTT, M.R.C.S. On the 28th July, 1892, hearty congratulations were tendered to Mr. Prescott on his being admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. VESTRY ELECTIONS. The Annual Election of Members of the Vestry and Auditors took place, without contests, on the 2nd May, 1892. DEATHS OF MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY.

BARCLAY COCKERTON, District Auditor. 91 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1892. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1892. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Twenty-third Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Births. During the year 1892 the number of Births registered was 246. This is the lowest number of the last decade. as will be seen on referring to Table I. This gradual diminution of the births is attributable to the fact that the Parish is of a less residential character than formerly. Business men having transferred their domiciles to the suburbs or country, they coming up to town daily to transact their business. 92 The following Table shows the number of Births registered in each month of the year :- Males. Females. Total. January 6 10 16 February 9 13 22 March 14 8 22 April 7 9 16 May 13 12 25 June 15 9 24 July 16 9 25 August 13 18 31 September 9 8 17 October 10 4 14 November 12 8 20 December 10 4 14 134 112 246 The Birth-rate of the Parish for the year 1892 would be 16.9 per 1,000 of the population. The Births registered in London during the year 1892, numbered 131,535, being in the proportion of 30.9 annually to 1,000 of the estimated population. This is the lowest birth-rate as yet recorded in London, with the single exception of the year 1890, when the rate was only 30.7. Deaths. In St. Martin-in-the-Fields the total Deaths in the year 1892, were 331. This is a less number than in the previous year, and is due to the closing of the Charing Cross Hospital for several weeks, for the purpose of undergoing repairs. 93 The following Table shows the number of Deaths registered in each month of the year 1892:— Males. Females. Total. January 25 17 42 February 17 10 27 March 23 13 36 April 20 15 35 May 20 11 31 June 21 14 35 July 12 7 19 August 8 6 14 September 12 8 20 October 15 12 27 November 10 13 23 December 15 7 22 198 133 331 These 331 Deaths include those non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, and therefore must be omitted in estimating the death-rate, but, on the other hand, the deaths occurring outside the Parish among persons belonging thereto, must be added. On referring to Table 7, it will at once clearly show my meaning. In computing the Death-rate of the Parish, notice is taken, as I have just stated, of those parishioners dying in Public Institutions outside the Parish, even to the Edmonton Workhouse of the Strand Union. In respect of the taking into account the deaths occurring in this latter institution, in compiling the death-rate of the Parish, I say in my Annual Report of the previous year, 1891, as follows :— "It has been a question whether the deaths in the Edmonton Workhouse should be included in the rate, and I must say not without reason, for it must be remembered that a great number of those who die in the Workhouse have been resident there many 94 years prior to their death, and have therefore practically ceased to be parishioners. But I have been informed from the office of the Registrar-General that these deaths should be taken into account in computing the death-rate. ' I am still of opinion that they ought not to be included in the mortality of St. Martin's; however, I will give the death-rate exclusive of the deaths in the Edmonton Workhouse 46 in number:— Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1892, excluding the 46 deaths which occurred in the Edmonton Workhouse 17.0 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1892, including the 46 deaths which occurred in the Edmonton Workhouse 20.2 per 1,000 of the estimated population. The first of these is the true death-rate of the Parish, a rate which shows a satisfactory condition of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The deaths registered in London during the year 1892, numbered 87,749, being in proportion of 20.6 per 1000 living. Infantile Mortality. The mortality of children under one year of age in the year 1892, was at the rate of 134.1 deaths to 1,000 births. Old Age Mortality. The deaths of parishioners over 60 occurring in and out of the Parish in the year 1892, numbered 92. 34 were from 60 to 70 years of age. 36 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ „ 21 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ „ 1 over 90 years. 95 Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The principal Zymotic Diseases are Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Cholera, and Diarrhoea. The total number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the above-named diseases was 23. This number includes those nonparishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting these, and adding those parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside, the mortality due to St. Martin-in-the-Fields would be 29 for the year. (See Table 5.) Small-pox.—No death or case of illness came under my notice. In London 8 deaths during the year were caused by this complaint. Measles.—Eight deaths occurred within the Parish from this disease, and 1 of a parishioner in King's College Hospital. Scarlet Fever.—The Metropolis was visited during the year with a severe epidemic of this malady, which sorely tried the machinery of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in their anxious endeavours to provide accommodation for such a rush of cases. On the 20th September, the Managers issued a letter to the Medical Officers of Health to the effect—That the available accommodation for Scarlet Fever cases at the Hospitals of the Board is temporarily exhausted, and that until the North Eastern Hospital shall be opened fresh cases can only be admitted as vacancies are occasioned by discharges and deaths, and that preference be given to the removal to the Board's Hospitals of those patients whose surroundings and conditions of life are such that retention within their homes would be prejudicial to themselves or to the community. This condition of affairs in many cases caused a good deal of anxiety, but fortunately this deadlock did not last long. In the Parish 2 deaths occurred from this disease, and 4 of parishioners outside, making a total of 6 to the credit of St. Martin s. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 181)1, was 54, against 28 of the previous year, 1891. 96 Diphtheria.—Ten deaths from this complaint occurred in the Parish, 4 of which were those of non-parishioners, who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. Whooping Cough.—No death in the Parish was due to this disease, but 1 of a parishioner occurred outside. Typhoid Fever.—No death was attributable to this malady. Typhus Fever.—No death was attributable to this malady. Diarrhœa.—Three deaths were recorded from this complaint, 2 of which were parishioners, and the other a non-parishioner, which occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital. The deaths from all causes, with the ages at death of those who died in the Parish, and also of those parishioners who died in institutions outside the district will be found fully detailed in Tables 2 and 6. Influenza. This disease was still amongst us in the early part of the year. Three deaths occurred within the Parish, and 3 of parishioners outside. At my suggestion, a leaflet was distributed in the Parish, which pointed out the precautionary measures to be taken to guard against the malady. Inquests. During the year 1892, there were held 60 inquests. The causes which produced death were as follows:— Natural causes 24 Pistol shot wound (suicide) 6 „ „ „ (murder) 1 7 Injuries received from falling downstairs 3 „ „ „ a falling frame whilst at work 1 Injuries received from falling down the shaft of a lift 1 Carried forward 36 97 Brought forward 36 Injuries received from the kick of a runaway horse 1 Injuries received from falling from a roof whilst at work 1 Injuries received from being run over by a Hansom cab Injuries caused by a knife stab in the chest (suicide) 1 Injuries received whilst collecting dust 1 „ „ from fall from fire escape 1 „ „ „ „ scaffold whilst at work 1 Suffocation (infant in the street) 1 Burns (child) whilst playing with the fire 1 „ (child) clothes ignited accidentally from kitchen fire 1 3 „ (adult) caused by a fire at 86, Long Acre 1 Poison, opium (suicide) 1 „ chlorodyne (suicide) 1 3 „ irritant, taken when in a state of intoxication 1 Razor wound of throat (suicide) 2 Drowning 5 Hanging (suicide) 1 Blood poisoning, after injury to little finger 1 60 Notification of Infectious Disease. During the year 102 cases of infectious disease were notified in conformity with the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The cost of the fees paid to the Medical Practitioners for certifying to these cases amounted to £10 7s. 6d.; this sum is repaid to the Vestry by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, At Table 9 will be found a classification of these 102 cases and the localities wherein they occurred. g 98 Cholera. About the month of August the country was alarmed by the possible outbreak of an epidemic of cholera. The fear was that the disease might be introduced into England by some of the numerous passengers arriving in vessels from cholera-stricken towns on the Continent, Hamburg in particular; but thanks to the vigilance of the several Port Sanitary Authorities, this dire disease obtained no foothold in this country. Every vessel coming from suspected ports was, on arrival here, overhauled by a Medical Officer, all the passengers medically examined, and any of them supposed to be suffering from this disease were detained and isolated, and the names and destination of the rest before leaving the ship wennoted, and forwarded to the respective sanitary authorities, with the object of keeping them under observation for a short time. On the 25t,h August, I received the following letter from Dr. R. Thorne-Thorne, the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board:— Private. 24th August, 1892. My Dear Sir, In view of the outbreak of cholera at Hamburg, and of the large traffic between that port and ports of this country, notably the Port of London, the Local Government Board are communicating with the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in order to obtain, as a preliminary step, information as to the accommodation that would be available in hospitals, infirmaries, and similar institutions, in case the epidemic should extend to London. But, owing to the shortness of the passage between Hamburg and this country, it must be regarded as possible that individual cases of cholera may make their appearance in London before the arrangements contemplated can be matured, and hence it has occurred to me that you would wish, pending the completion of the arrangements referred to, to consider how any such cases may be promptly dealt 99 with in your District, by way of isolation or otherwise. I may add that I am communicating to each Medical Officer of Health in London a letter similar to this one. I am, Very faithfully yours, R. THORNE-THORNE. Your Vestry being in vacation at the time of the receipt of this letter, I was at first at a loss how to act; however, I called upon two of your members, and showed them this communication, with the result that a Special Meeting of the Vestry was convened, and, at this Meeting, a Special Vigilance Cholera Committee was appointed to meet as often as circumstances required. This Committee recommended the following precautionary measures, which were faithfully carried out by your officers:—The surface of all the courts to be more frequently flushed also the pipe-sewers in the courts; the free use of disinfectants; all vacant plots of buildingland to be cleansed and disinfected; all offensive dust-bins to be disinfected after the removal of the dust; the public urinals to be cleansed and disinfected three times daily; and the Sanitary Inspector to use extra vigilance in the detection of nuisances. In the meantime, I had an interview with an official of St. Thomas' Hospital, to ask him if the authorities of that institution would admit any case of cholera occurring in the Parish before arrangements could be made on a larger scale for the accommodation of such cases. This gentleman kindly informed me that he thought there would be no difficulty in the matter. I made inquiries also at the Charing Cross Hospital, but being entirely closed for repairs, it was hopeless to expect any immediate help from that institution; they, however, as will be seen further on, allotted beds for our use. Subsequently, inquiries and negotiations were carried on with the authorities of the following institutions tor the purpose of ascertaining what accommodation they could afford us in the event of an outbreak of cholera. The result was as follows:— Cleveland Street Infirmary of the Strand Union 56 beds. Bear Yard Casual Ward „ „ 40 „ Charing Cross Hospital 20 „ King's College Hospital 24 „ St. Thomas' Hospital 30 „ G2 100 House to House Sanitary Inspection. In the latter part of the year it was decided that a sanitary inspection of all the houses in the Parish should be carried out as early as practicable, for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the drains, yards, sinks, water-closets, &c. In view cf this undertaking-, a circular letter was addressed to the owners and occupiers, informing them of this proposal, and asking their co-operation. By your directions I selected three qualified Inspectors for the purpose of carrying out your wishes; their duties were to commence on the 2nd January, 1893. In my future Report, for the year 1893, I shall have the pleasure of detailing the results of this inspection. Food and Drugs Act. Under this Act your Analyst examined 22 samples of food, as follows:— Coffee 3 sampies. Sugar 3 „ Milk 4 Butter 3 „ Pepper 3 „ Whiskey 3 „ Ale 2 Porter 1 sample. They were are all found to be genuine, with the exception of one of the samples of milk, but it was not sufficiently bad to warrant a piosecution. Sanitary Notices. Dining the year Sanitary Notices to the number of 157 were served upon the owners or occupiers of property, besides numerous verbal recommendations to remedy sanitary defects. Bake-Houses. The bake-houses have been regularly inspected. Three required lime-whiting, and notices were accordingly served. 101 Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Sanitary Inspector, whom you appointed permanently to inspect these houses, has regularly carried out this duty, and has reported to me all sanitary defects coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street. 102 TABLE I. BIRTHS.

The footway in Catherine Street opposite Little Catherine Street, also the neighbouring yard known as "Two Spies" Court, have been paved with mastic asphalte, the latter at the joint expense of the Vestry and the Strand Board of Works. The asphalte carriageway in Charles Street has been extended by including the crossing from Castle Street to Broker's Alley. Extra repairs were necessitated on the footway in Leicester Square in making good to the Urinal removed from Whitehall. The portion of the north footway in Orange Street opposite the Baths and Wash-houses has been renewed and new kerbs provided. The portion of the west footway in Wellington Street within this parish has been taken up and relaid and new kerbs provided. Posts have been erected in Broad Court to prevent barrows entering from Long Acre. A new refuge has been constructed in Whitehall Yard at its junction with Whitehall. LIGHTING. The following is a statement of the number of public lamps on the 25th March, 1893, with consumption of gas and cost per annum:— No. of Lamps. Cubic feet of Gas consumed per hour. Cost per annum. £ S. d. 559 6 3 9 3 per lamp. 34 10 5 3 4 „ 6 15 7 6 1 „ 2 19 9 12 2 „ 15 20 10 0 9 „ 2 25 12 3 5 „ 2 50 till midnight 17 13 6 „ 20 after 10 32 till midnight 11 12 6 „ 8 after „ 119 During the year the following lamps have been cut off:- 2 in Whitehall attached to Urinal now removed. 1 in Whitchall Yard (passage to Middle Scotland Yard). 1 upon old Urinal in Leicester Square. Additional lamps have been fixed as follows:— 1 in Taylor's Buildings, near St. Martin's Lane. 1 in Whitehall Yard, opposite entrance to Middle Scotland Yard. 1 in "Two Spies" Court (at the joint expense of the Vestry and Strand District Board of Works). 1 (20-ft. lamp) on new Refuge in Whitehall Yard. 1 in York Place Urinal. 2 on Urinal in Leicester Square. The ornamental globe lamps in Northumberland Avenue are now supplied direct from the mains, the two large meters having been removed. Three lamp columns of the new pattern were fixed in Duncannon Street, and one in St. Martin's Lane opposite May's Buildings at the time of re-paving the footways; a new pattern lamp column has also been fixed on the south footway in Whitehall. A lamp column has been fixed on the new footway in Whitehall Yard, in substitution of a previous bracketted lamp attached to the adjoining boarded fence. The position of a lamp column on the north footway in Wilson Street has also been slightly altered to allow of its being farther from a paved crossing. h2 120 The cost of lighting, cleansing, and maintaining has been as follows:— £ s. d. Gas Light and Coke Company—Gas 2,540 19 9 Repairs to lanterns and painting 14 9 6 Alterations in the position of lamps 28 6 2 New columns and lanterns 87 2 9 St. James' Vestry—Moiety of cost of 3 refuge lamps in the Haymarket 42 15 4 £2,713 13 6 SLOP AND DUST COLLECTING. From the tabulated statement attached to this Report it will be seen that there have been removed from the parish 23,814 cubic yards of house refuse, and 9,024 cubic yards of slop. The Vestry's dust vans have been increased in size by providing new side-boards of an extra depth, thus giving a capacity of another cubic yard. This has been found to be more economical than hiring extra vans as formerly. In addition to the hand sweepers, 2 machine brooms, and 10 Slop and Dust Vans have been employed in this work. It has also been found necessary occasionally to employ extra slop vans. The cost has been as follows :— £ s. d. Wages, Sweepers 387 16 5 „ Dustmen 337 17 6 „ Work for the Unemployed 101 0 11 „ Gabriel, J.

This work has cost— £ s. d. Labour 665 10 7 Horse Hire (washing) 29 14 0 Brooms, squeegees, and sundries 24 5 0 Water 1 5 0 Hand Trucks 14 0 0 « £734 14 7 The footways in front of vacant spaces have been swept and cleansed as previously, and on and after the 1st of January, 1892, when the provisions of the New Public Health Act (London), 1891, came into force, the whole of the footways in the parish have been regularly swept and cleansed, with the exception of those formerly cleansed by H.M. Office of Works, which were taken over by the Vestry on April 1, 1892. The number of men employed upon this work and the cleansing of the courts has varied from 4 to 10, according to the state of the weather This work has cost £257 7s. 6d. 122 BALLASTING STREETS. Additional ballast bins have been fixed as follows:— 1 in Leicester Square. 1 on refuge Charing Cross Road. 1 „ Trafalgar Square, North. 1 „ Endell Street. 1 „ Charing Cross. 1 in Salisbury Street. 1 in Duke Street. The wood and other pavements have been frequently ballasted during frosty or wet weather at the following cost:— £ s. d.

Hire of Horses and Drivers 306 12 0 Supply of Water 152 6 8 New Water Post;, Leicester Square 14 0 8 Repairs to Vans and Painting 6 19 8 £479 19 0 In the very hot weather a solution of manganate of soda and sulphuric acid, being similar to the disinfectants used in flushing the courts and alleys, is mixed with the water. The stand post in St. Martin's Street, supplied with water from ELM. Office of Works, has been removed, the water for same not, having been constant; a new one, supplied with water from the New River Company, having been fixed in Leicester Square in substitution therefor. 123 SNOW REMOVAL. There have only been a few snow showers during the past winter, consequently no difficulty has been experienced in dealing with same. What little did accumulate was swept up immediately and carted to the river, as in the previous winter. The total cost incurred for the removal is as follows :— £ s. d. Labour 15 9 7 Hire of Horses, &c. 33 8 9 Water 7 13 2 £56 11 6 LIMEWHITING COURTS, The courts and other passages in the parish have been limewhited twice, at a cost of £39 4s. id. STREET NAME PLATES. New name plates, of zinc metal, painted, have been fixed in the following streets and courts :— Arundel Place (2). Charles Buildings. Conduit Court. Great Scotland Yard. Hop Gardens. Taylor's Buildings. Turner's Court TREES—CHARING CROSS ROAD AND CHURCHYARD. The whole of the trees have been re-tied where necessary, and fresh soil added; they have also been watered in the very dry weather. 124 HYDE PARK CORNER ROADS. The Vestry's share for the past year of the cost of maintaining the above roads (viz.: one-third of the total cost as provided in the Hyde Park Maintenance Act, 1887), amounts to £441 5s. 9d. These roads have now been repaved with wood, instead of macadam. CLEANSING SEWERS AND GULLIES. The Gullies in the parish (about 420), exclusive of those under the control of the London County Council, have been emptied from time to time and flushed with a solution of manganate of soda and sulphuric acid; the surfaces of all courts have also been flushed periodically at the following total cost— £ s. d. Labour 61 14 4 Horse Hire 154 9 8 Water 9 4 6 Sundries 11 8 Shooting of deposit removed 9 16 0 £235 16 2 The Parish Sewers have been cleansed where necessary, and all the pipe sewers have been frequently flushed with water through an open hose, at a cost of— £ s. d. Labour 155 11 9 Supply of Water 113 1 0 Sundries 23 18 8 Horse Hire 17 10 0 Shooting of deposit removed 10 8 0 £326 9 5 The cost of cleansing sewers has increased, by reason of the extra precautions taken by the Committee appointed specially to consider as to means to be taken for the prevention of cholera in August, 1892. 125 HOUSE DRAINAGE. Plans for the drainage of the following new properties have been submitted and conditionally approved, viz.:- Castle Street and Neal Street (Messrs.

The number of plans deposited for amended house drainage has materially increased, by reason of the Vestry's resolution that a house to house inspection of all Sanitary works on private properties throughout the parish be made. This necessarily entailed a very large increase of both the office and outdoor work. STREET GULLIES. The gullies at the undermentioned placcs have been re-constructed and stoneware trapped gullies fixed— Hunt's Court. 2 in Turner's Court. 1 in Charles Street. 2 in Villiers Street. 1 in Banbury Court. 1 in Strand (by Cecil Street). 1 in Whitehall Yard. 1 in Catherine Street. The total cost of this work to the Vestry has been £46 9s. 9d. REPAIRS TO SEWERS. Surface ventilation has been provided to the dead end of the sewer in Russell Street which was formerly unventilated. Sundry small repairs to sewers have been made at a cost of £12 0s. 6d. NEW SEWERS. Turner's Court. A new 9-inch pipe sewer has been constructed in Turner's Court, with two manholes on same and flushing chamber. A manhole has also been constructed over the Bedfordbury Sewer at the junction of the new sewer therewith. An up-cast ventilation shaft has also been erected at the upper end of the new sewer. The cost of this work, which has been done by contract, amounted to £356 12s. 8d. 127 PUBLIC URINALS. The following is a list of the public urinals in the parish, to all of which water is supplied by meter:- Brewer's Lane 2 Compartments Slate. Charing Cross Road 6 „ „ Charles Street 4 „ „ Durham Street 6 „ „ Leicester Square 6 „ „ Orange Street 4 „ Iron. Rose Street 4 „ „ Taylor's Buildings 3 „ Slate. Vinegar Yard 8 „ Iron. York Place 4 „ (recently erected) Slate. The total cost of this maintenance is as follows:— £ s. d. Labour (flushing and cleansing) 65 14 0 Supply of water, and rent of meters 123 11 0 Repairs, alterations, &c. 37 4 0 Removal—Whitehall to Leicester Square 65 4 6 £291 13 6 The iron Urinal in Leicester Square having been in want of considerable repairs, it was thought advisable to erect upon the same site one of better construction. The slate urinal in Whitehall, opposite Whitehall Place, was therefore removed to this site, as in consequence of the opening of the Underground Conveniences in Charing Cross, it was not required in its former position. Extensive repairs, consisting of a re-construction of the floor and drainage arrangements, have been carried out to the Urinal in Charing Cross Road. A new Urinal has been erected in York Place upon property belonging to the South Eastern Railway Co, who have conditionally granted the site to the Vestry.
