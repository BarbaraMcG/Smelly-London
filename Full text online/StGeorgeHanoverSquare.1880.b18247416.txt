HAN 29 THE VESTRY OF THE parish of St. George, HANOVER SQUARE. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1880. JUNE 1881. LONDON: PRINTED BY HUTCHINGS & CROWSLEY LIMITED, 123, Fulham Road, S.W.; & Henry Street, N.W 1881. ???30 REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION of the Parish of St. George,Hanover Square, FOR THE YEAR 1880, by W. H. CORFIELD, M.A.,M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (Lond.), Professor of Hygiene and Public Health in University College, London, medical officer of health. (being his ninth annual report.) To the Vestry of the Parish of St. George, hanover square. My Lords and Gentlemen, The year 1880 has been signalised by the lowest death rate on record for the Parish. The gross total of deaths registered in the Parish during the 52 weeks ending January 1st, 1881, was 1,855, or almost the same as the average annual number for the preceding ten years. 2 The population of the Parish was enumerated on April 1st, 1881, with the following results:— Sub-District. Population. Hanover Square 16,858 Mayfair 13,481 Belgravia 59,171 Total for the Parish 89,510 This is lower by 248 for the whole Parish than it was in 1871, when the Census gave the following results:— Sub-District. Population. Hanover Square 18,700 Mayfair 13,020 Belgravia 58,038 Total for the Parish 89,758 Thus the fact that the population of the Parish has remained practically stationary is due to the increase in Belgravia and Mayfair being counterbalanced by a considerable diminution in the Hanover Square Sub-District. This diminution is, no doubt, chiefly due to the demolishing of small houses and the erection of workshops on their sites. As I have calculated all the death-rates in previous years on the assumption that the population was increasing at the moderate rate that prevailed between 1851 and 1861, the death-rates given in previous years have been slightly too low; whereas the death-rates given by the Registrar General for London, during the last ten years, have been all too high, because the population has increased at a greater rate than was allowed for. The population of the Parish is to the enumerated population of London as 1 to 42 3/5. 3 Table I. year. Gross Total of Deaths. Deaths in Public Institutions.

As our proportional share of the deaths occurring in all the Public Institutions in London was only 347, the corrected total of deaths was only 1,489, against an average of 1,701, during 4 the ten years from 1870 to 1879. This is equivalent to a death-rate of only 16'64 per thousand per annum, or more than 2 per thousand less than the average of the preceding ten years, and nearly 1 per thousand less than it was in 1877 —the lowest annual death-rate previously recorded. The death-rate of London, and also that of the twentythree large English Towns, were both lower than last year, but that of London was a little higher than in 1877, as will be seen from Table Ia. So low a death-rate as 16'64 must at present be regarded as exceptional, and is not, I think, likely to be maintained in future years, though we may hope that it will be. Table Ia. Death Rates per 1,000 per annum. 1874 1875 1876 1877 1878 1879 1880 Twenty-three Towns 26.3 26.4 23.7 23.0 24.4 23.4 22.7 London 22.6 23.7 22.3 21.9 23.5 23.3 22.2 St. George's Hanover Square 18.56 19.05 18.20 17.46 18.17 18.25 16.64 The death-rate in greater London was 21 per thousand per annum, being 22.2 in London proper and 16.6 in the Outer Ring. In 1879 the corresponding rates were 22, 23.3, and 16.9. It thus appears that the corrected death-rate in this Parish in 1880 was almost exactly the same as that in the Outer Ring of Greater London. Neither of the 23 large towns in the United Kingdom had nearly so low a death-rate as this Parish; the nearest to it being Portsmouth with 18.7, and the next Brighton with 19.6 5 The death-rate of Portsmouth is usually lower than that of this Parish, but it has increased from 16.7 in 1879 to 18.7 in 1880. Dublin has not only afforded the highest death-rate among the large towns, but its rate goes on increasing; in 1879 it was 35.1, in 1880 it was no less than 36.1, being 6.5 per thousand higher than it was in 1878, and 10.3 higher than it was in 1875. Liverpool, as usual, comes next with 27'3, then Salford with 25.8, and Manchester with 25.4; the Manchester rate is 1.5 lower than in 1879, the Salford rate 11 higher, and the Liverpool slightly higher. No large foreign city had so small a death-rate as that of this Parish, the lowest being Philadelphia 19.3, Baltimore 19.7, and Christiana 20.3; and the highest St. Petersburg 46.1, Madras 44.8, Alexandria 42.5, and Madrid 40.1.

The birth-rate was 23.91 per thousand of the population. It must be remembered that the birth-rates for previous years are all given rather too low for the reason already stated. The birth-rate in London was 36.2, in Greater London 35.8, and in the Outer Ring 32.3. The average birth-rate of the large towns of the United Kingdom was 36.1, the highest being those of Birmingham 38.6, and Salford 38.4, and the lowest that of Brighton 30.0. The number of deaths of children under one year of age, 310, was 12 more than in the 53 weeks of 1879, and almost exactly the same as in 1877 and 1878, in each of which years it was 309; the percentage of such deaths to the registered births was almost the same as in 1877, but greater than in 1878 or 1879, while the percentage of these deaths to the total deaths, though greater than in either of the two previous years, was less than in 1877. The mortality of children under one year of age is seen to be almost exactly 145 deaths to 1,000 births; this is lower than that in any of the large towns, the nearest being Bristol 146, and Portsmouth 148; that of London is 158; and the highest, those of Norwich 214 and Leicester 219; the average of the 20 large towns being 169.

In fact, nearly two-fifths of the total deaths in the Parish were those of persons of 60 years of age and upwards. The percentage of violent deaths, was greater than during the last 3 years, and, as usual, greater than in London generally. Table IV. SUB-district. Population at middle of 1880. Births. Birthrate.

Table IV shows that, as usual, the birth-rate of the Hanover Square Sub-District is lower than that of the others, and the death-rate of Mayfair lower than that of the other Sub-Districts; Belgravia having the highest birth-rate and the highest death-rate; while Table IVa shows that the birth-rates are all higher than in either of the last three years, and the death-rates all the lowest yet recorded for the Parish and its Sub-Districts. 8 Table IVa. birth-rates. death-rates. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879. 1880. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879. 1880.

Hanover Square Sub-District 55.18 years. Mayfair „ 61.79 „ Belgravia „ 46.86 „ Whole Parish 58.01 „ These numbers are all higher than in previous years, on account of the very low death-rates, with the somewhat increased birth-rates. The mean duration of life in this Parish, during the last six years, has been as follows:— In 1875 it was 46.67 years. „ 1876 „ 47.96 „ „ 1877 „ 49.52 „ „ 1878 „ 48.03 „ „ 1879 „ 48.55 „ „ 1880 „ 58.01 „ The mean duration of life in London during 1880 was 35.17 years, as against 34.23 in 1879, and 34.24 in 1878. 9 Table V.

Viz., „ 1 ,,15; „ ,, ,, 2. 10 Table V shows that the total number of deaths from infectious diseases and diarrhoea, viz., 182, was greater than in 1879, being almost exactly the same as in 1878; but it is considerably less than the average of the last ten years, which is nearly 205. The number of these deaths is equivalent to 2 per 1,000 of the population, whereas the number in London generally was equivalent to 3'7 per 1,000 of the population living. The increase in the number of these deaths is due to a slight increase for each disease, except Measles, (which has been much less fatal than in 1879), and a considerable increase in the fatality of Whooping Cough. The deaths from Measles, Fevers, (including Typhus, Enteric, and Simple Continued Fevers,) and Diarrhcea, were below the decennial averages, while those from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Whooping Cough, were above them. The epidemic of Scarlet Fever which began in 1879, continued until the end of October, 1880, when it abated. Of the 40 deaths from this disease, registered in the Parish during 1880, three were those of non-parishioners, who died in St. George's Hospital, of Kidney Disease after Scarlet Fever. Of the 18 deaths from Diphtheria, 8 were those of nonparishioners in St. George's Hospital, so that there were only 10 deaths of parishioners from this disease, and one of these was a doubtful case: in 1879, from this disease, 12 deaths of parishioners, and 2 of non-parishioners, were registered in the Parish. The number of deaths from the Continued Fevers remains as in 1879, much below the average. The death from Typhus Fever was that of a doubtful case, but of course all precautions were taken, just as if it had been true Typhus, and no other case occurred. 11 Of the 15 deaths from Enteric (Typhoid) Fever, 2 were those of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, 3 were known to be imported, 1 was a doubtful case, and 1 was registered as "Gastric Fever," and of the 2 deaths from Simple Continued Fever one was that of a non-parishioner, and the other was an imported case. Diarrhoea caused only 39 deaths, whereas the average for the previous 10 years was a little over 56 per annum. This is the more remarkable, as epidemic diarrhoea was exceedingly prevalent and fatal in London generally, causing 3,767 deaths in 1880, as against 1,835 in 1879. Small-pox in London. Small-pox caused 475 deaths in London as against 458 in 1879; the numbers for the last four years have been as follows:— 1877 2,544 deaths 1878 1,416 „ 1879 458 „ 1880 475 „ In 1877 and 1878 the disease was severely epidemic: in 1880 the number of deaths was still above the average of the non-epidemic years of the last ten years. And when we see that the total number of deaths from this disease in the 19 other large towns of England was only 10, although their aggregate population is rather more than that of London, we see that Small-pox is far too fatal in London. Out of the 475 fatal cases, there were 142, or 29.9 per cent. in which the death certificates gave no information as to Vaccination; of the remaining 333, "no less than 68.8 per cent. were certified to have been unvaccinated." 12 Sanitary Work. For the Year ending March 31st, 1881. The following table has been compiled for me by Mr. Joseph Snook, your Sanitary Inspector, from the Report Book:— Table VI. Various kinds of Complaints of Nuisances, &c., from April 1st, 1880, to March 31st, 1881. Total number of Complaints 627 Notices served 116 Houses and premises limewhited 31 Houses disinfected after infectious diseases 168 Old brick drains abolished, and glazed stoneware pipes substituted 23 New drains constructed 4 Drains unstopped and repaired 62 Drains trapped and ventilated, sinks disconnected, &c. 26 Closets supplied with water 38 Closets unstopped and repaired 32 Roofs repaired 7 New dust bins provided 2 Dust bins renewed, repaired, new covers, &c. 17 Cisterns repaired, new covers, &c. 13 New cisterns provided 7 Waste pipes disconnected 29 Removal of animals improperly kept (cases of) 0 Meat, fish, &c., condemned (cases of) 8 Overcrowding abated 7 Cesspools abolished 6 Accumulation of dung, straw, &c., removed 70 Various nuisances removed 76 No cause for complaint on inspection 39 13 Legal proceedings taken 0 Cases could not assist 6 Cases referred to Surveyor 15 Cases referred to Police 1 Licensed cow-sheds 7 Licensed slaughter-houses 12 Cases removed to Hospitals 103 Inspection of houses after cases of infectious diseases, viz.— Typhoid and low fever 16 Typhus fever 0 Scarlet fever 134 Small-pox 34 Diphtheria 3 The articles disinfected in the hot-air disinfecting chamber belonging to the Parish were as follows:— 151 Beds 156 Bolsters 162 Mattresses 215 Pillows 73 Palliasses 92 Carpets 121 Quilts 24 Hearth-rugs 381 Blankets 43 Curtains 283 Sheets 34 Towels 24 Dresses 66 Cushions 20 Shawls 45 Table Covers 13 Coats 42 Rugs 29 Waistcoats 15 Suits of clothing And a large quantity of sundry articles. In accordance with a resolution passed by the Committee of Works, I prepared the following instructions for the men employed in disinfecting, and they were printed by order of the Committee of Works, together with the "Suggestions by the Society of Medical Officers of Health for Preventing the spread of Infectious or Contagious Diseases, such as Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Fever, &c." 14 DIRECTIONS TO THE INSPECTOR and TO THE MEN EMPLOYED IN DISINFECTING. Printed by Order of the Committee of Works. On receiving notice of the existence of a case of infectious disease, the Inspector visits the house, makes enquiries as to the state of the case, whether a recent attack, &c., inspects sanitary arrangements of house where necessary, and appoints a time (if possible) for the disinfection. He sends the men with No. 1 truck and bags to fetch the bedding, &c.; the bedding, clothing, &c., is to be placed in the bags before being carried through the house to the truck; the truck is to be kept closed while being taken through the streets. In case of death a pound or more of carbolic powder is to be placed in the coffin. The rooms are to be fumigated according to the printed directions issued by the Society of Medical Officers of Health, and limewhited afterwards. (Sec. 13.) The bedding and clothing are to be stoved in the disinfecting chamber, the heat being regulated so that the thermometer shows from 140° to 150; this will be equivalent to a temperature of about 240° inside the oven. The time they are to be left in the oven varies from half an hour to two hours or even more in the case of thick bedding, mattresses, &c. If they cannot be taken home at once, they are to be placed in the adjoining, but separate chamber; they are to be taken home in No. 2 truck. The men to wear the overalls provided for disinfecting 15 purposes throughout, except while walking through the streets, when they are to be carried in a bag provided for the purpose. W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (London), Medical Officer of Health. 10, Bolton Row, Mayfair, W., June, 1880. The total number of complaints attended to and of notices served was somewhat higher than last year, as also was the number of houses disinfected after cases of infectious disease, owing to the continuation of the scarlet fever epidemic, and the slight increase of small-pox. It was not necessary to take out any summons, as all the notices were complied with. The markets have been regularly inspected, and kept in good order, it having been necessary to condemn only 8 cases of articles of food exposed for sale. A consignment of about 800 hares from Hungary proving a nuisance to the persons in the house over the store, I insisted on their being at once removed. The alteration in the fall of some of the sewers in the neighbourhood of St. George's Square and Grosvenor Road has been carried out, so that they no longer discharge into the river. My attention was called by the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London to the existence of two foul outfalls at Chelsea Bridge; I found that they were from the water-closets at the old toll houses, and that these were being temporarily used by some workmen employed by the Metropolitan Board of Works: at my request the use of them was abandoned, and other arrangements made. The improvements to the water supply to the closets in the Lumley, Coleshill, and Ebury Model Dwellings, which I 16 suggested in order to separate the water-closets from the drinking water, have been carried out by the Company. The Slaughter-houses and Cowsheds are regularly inspected and kept in a satisfactory condition: no license was opposed either by the Parish or by the Metropolitan Board of Works; I, however, recommended that the license for the cowshed in Paradise Row be withheld until certain alterations were made; the license was not applied for, and the shed has since been turned into a stable.

In both cases the average quality was rather inferior to that of the preceding year, and the water occasionally supplied is of decidedly inferior quality, especially in winter, when the river is in flood. The Grand Junction Company are increasing their pumping power, so that they will be able to deliver a considerably larger quantity of water per diem in case of any extra demand in the hot weather. The common gas supplied by the London Gas Company has been examined by me from time to time at their testing room, and has always been found to be above the required standard of illuminating power, and to satisfy the prescribed tests for ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen. For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases is kept at the Workhouse, in Mount Street; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply to the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington; or, in case of small-pox, at the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, where they can be accommodated on favourable terms. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (London). 10, Bolton Row, Mayfair, W., June, 1881. 18 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT op the Medical Officer of Health. Summary of Analytical Work for the Year ending March 25th, 1881. NAME OF SAMPLE. Genuine. Of doubtful Quality. Adulterated. Total. Milk 20 5 7 32 Bread 22 — — 22 Butter 1 — 1 2 Tea 12 — — 12 Coffee 4 — 5 9 Mustard 9 — 3 12 Pepper 10 — 2 12 Flour 18 — — 18 Sugar 12 — — 12 Gin 4 — — 4 Brandy 4 — 3 7 Whisky 4 — — 4 Rum 1 — 2 3 Vinegar 8 — — 8 Cayenne Pepper 1 — — 1 130 5 23 158 19 Of these 158 samples, four, namely 2 of milk, 1 of butter, and 1 of cayenne pepper, were brought by private purchasers, they were all genuine samples: 2, of milk, were brought by the Inspector of the Metropolitan Dairymen's Association, they were both adulterated to the extent of 13 per cent. with added water. I gave certificates to that effect and the Association prosecuted, but a conviction was not obtained, as the magistrate ruled that the farmer who sent the milk to London had not received the notice (which was sent by telegram) soon enough for him to be present when the samples were taken. The following convictions were obtained by your Inspector on my certificates:— Albert and Sarah Heddon, of 15, Robert Street, Grosvenor Square, for selling butter adulterated with 90 per cent. of foreign fats; fined 40s. and 12s. 6d. costs. Emma Iles, of 12, Little Grosvenor Street, for selling milk containing 10 per cent. of added water; fined 5s. and 2s. costs. The 3 other adulterated samples of milk were obtained for information. The samples of milk classed as of doubtful quality contained too little cream, and had been probably skimmed or slightly watered. The adulterated Brandies were very little below the standard allowed by the Act. Of the samples of Rum, the genuine one was obtained where an adulterated one had previously been purchased; the two adulterated ones (one very slightly below the standard) were obtained for information. The adulterated Coffees contained various proportions of 20 chicory, and some were labelled to that effect: the adulterated Mustards contained Wheat Flour and Turmeric; and the adulterated Peppers coutained a small proportion of Rice Flour. Some of the samples of Tea contained small quantities of "Lie" Tea. It is interesting to note that although more samples were analysed than last year, fewer were found to be adulterated, and that the adulterations were in most instances slight in amount. W. H.
