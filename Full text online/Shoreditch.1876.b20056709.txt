A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ending Lady-day, 1877. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Act," 1855. REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1877, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £54,603 8s. 4d; the amount in the pound levied for the four quarters was 2s. 4d., being for the quarter to Midsummer, 7d.; to Michaelmas, 7d.; to Christmas, 8d.; and to Lady-day, 6d The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Lady-day, 1876, was £38,000; and for the last year £43,000; and for the halfyear, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1877, is £27,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1876, was nil, and the same satisfactory result was attained at the end of the last year. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rate will be found in the Balance Sheet given with the Accountant's Report. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The Accountant's statement hereto appended will give the details of the receipts and expenditure on account of the Sewers and General 6 Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the rates levied for the last two years were— 1876. 1877. General in the & 1/11 2/- Sewers ditto 7d. 5d. 2/6 2/5 The total amount collected on the Vestry rates for the year was £56,172 6s. 4d. ASSESSMENTS. The Valuation List for the previous year amounted to £609.278 Gross value, and £491,391 Rateable value. For the present year the amount is fixed at Gross value £617,135; Rateable value, £497,530; being an increase of £7857 and £6139 respectively. There were no appeals against the List, either at the Special or the Assessment Sessions. COLLECTION OF RATES. With a view to show the great improvement which has been effected in the Collection of Rates during the past few years, I have prepared the following table, from official figures furnished by the Accountant. The periods taken range over the last five years:— Year. Rates made for the Quarter ending Midsummer. Outstanding at the earliest period ascertained after Midsummer-day. Date, (see previous column). Per eentage of Loss from all causes except allowance to owaers on the Rate. 1872 27,667 £30,417 1st July 7.40 1873 24,092 16,103 30th June 5.05 1875 22,295 5,925 26th June 3.53 1877 31,417 1,094 2nd July 2.33 During the past year the Finance Committee has giv1en considerable attention to the subject of improving" the collection of the 7 rates, and effecting a more speedy recovery of the same, because, first: any loss in the collection, from whatever cause it may arise, must fall upon those ratepayers who do pay, and who thereby are doubly taxed; and, secondly, because the Poor Law Auditor insists upon the rates being collected practically within the period for which they are made. The Finance Committee appointed an Audit Committee, consisting. of the Chairman and one Member from each Ward (two from Church Ward), to give special attention to this important duty. In May last, the Audit Committee reported to the Finance Committee that the loss on the previous rate, which was closed on the second week in April, including the amount excused, was £2 Cs. 9d. per cent., which was the lowest per cent-age of loss ever attained, the loss on the rates for the previous quarter being £2 9s. Od. per cent., and for the previous year about 3 per cent. In 1867-70 the collection of a quarter's rate extended over nine months. There were, therefore, three rates in collection at one period. In 1872 the time occupied was six mouths. Now the rate is completely collected in thirteen or fourteen weeks, and only one rate is in the hands of the Collectors at the same time. This improvement must necessarily be attended with a considerable saving to those ratepayers who regularly pay their own and formerly had to pay the defaulters' share. The amount collected in one year varies from £100,000 to £120,000. Taking the lower sum, 1 per cent. is a £1000. The difference in the losses in 1873 and 1877 is about 2f per cent., consequently the saving to the ratepayers, by prompt collection, as compared with 1873, is nearly £3000 per year. It would be more compared with 1872; but a part of that loss was owing to a reduction of railway assessment, and is therefore not considered. There is one new expedient brought into operation this year in the collection, which in time promises to work well. Formerly, the Vestry paid out of the rates about £100 per year for brokers' time, in addition to such charges as the broker might make in cases where he distrained. In an Act passed in the Session of 1876, the following provision was enacted, in consequence of which the Poor Law Auditor intimated 8 his intention of disallowing all brokers' expenses charged upon the rates, unless they were irrecoverable from the parties:— "In all cases where a Warrant of Distress is issued for the recovery of a Poor Rate, the person against whom the same is issued shall be liable to pay the cost of such Warrant, and of the Broker or other officer for his attendance to make the levy, although such person may tender the amount of the Rate before any levy is made"—[39 & 40 Vic., cap. 61, sec. 31.] Acting upon the principle sanctioned by the Act, that those who require the broker should pay for him, that functionary is empowered by the Warrant to charge three shillings for his attendance, even though the rates may be tendered before a levy is made. Those who have had to pay this charge naturally consider themselves aggrieved, but as this charge is not made until some days after the Sessions are held, and only after a final notice fixing the latest day for payment, the charge (except in cases of real poverty, which the Collectors are not expected to press without further instructions) must be regarded as a penalty for the ratepayer's negligence, and therefore no great hardship. It is probable that when the system of close collection becomes better understood among the parishioners it will seldom be necessary to employ brokers as assistant collectors. RAILWAYS, &c. No new powers have been applied for in the present Session in respect to Railways, but the North Metropolitan Tramways Company has applied for powers to extend the New North Road Tramway to Islington, and the Kingsland Road and Hackney road lines to the City, near to Bishopsgatc Church. The Vestry gave its consent to the former, but refused it to the latter. Ultimately, upon the opposition of the Metropolitan Board, the Shoreditch extension was limited to a point near the Bethnal Green Road, in the Shoreditch High Street. 9 NEW STREET—SUN STREET TO WORSHIP STREET. The Metropolitan Board has commenced to acquire the propertyrequired for the formation of this street. It would be a mere conjecture to say when it is probable that it will be completed. FOOTWAY PAYING IN ACTON WARD. The footways of the comparatively new streets in this Ward are being proceeded with, and the moiety of costs is being contributed by the owners or occupiers without occasion to resort (except in one or two minor instances) to legal proceedings. There is every reason to believe that by the end of the year the entire work will have been completed, and the share of costs to be contributed by the owners or occupiers will have been paid. The extent of the works undertaken will be more fully ascertained by reference to the Surveyor's report. GREAT EASTERN STREET—SHOREDITCH IMPROVEMENT. The first of these new streets was opened in October last, on which occasion the Metropolitan Board attended, and after the ceremony partook of luncheon in the Town Hall. The Vestry found it necessary to make some representations to the Board as to the level upon which the street was being constructed. During its progress the alleged defect was remedied, and in that respect the thoroughfare may now be said to be satisfactory. The Shoreditch High Street widening was so far as the thoroughfare is concerned completed at Christmas last. It is satisfactory to see that there are indications that the building land adjacent to each improvement will be speedily and satisfactorily let. 10 MORTUARY. The new public Mortuary erected in the Churchyard of this Parish, the completion of which was announced in our last report, was opened in April, 1876. It has satisfactorily answered its purpose. No complaints whatever have reached the Vestry concerning its management. A few trilling additions have been made to it, such as providing utensils, laying on gas, &c. The number of bodies admitted since its opening to the 25th of March last was 124. NEW PAVING LOANS. During this year the Vestry resolved to pave the following roads and streets with Granite cubcs:—Pearson Street, Weymouth Terrace, Harman Street, Canal Road, Goldsmith's Row (part of), Tabernacle Sqaure (part of), Whitmore Road, and to relay Wilson Street (part of), a portion of which is in the Parish of St. Luke's, and of which that Parish will by agreement bear a proportion. To meet the expense of these works a loan of £15,000 was negotiated with the Metropolitan Board, to be taken up in instalments of £5000 each, at Lady-day, Midsummer and Michaelmas, at £3 15s. per cent, The works have been commenced. The state of indebtedness of the Vestry in respect to loans will be seen by reference to the tabic in this report. NEW SEWERS WORKS. . In February last the Vestry ordered new Sewers to be constructed at an estimated cost of about £4000, but 110 sufficient progress has been made in that work to permit of any further notice in this report. CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY. Application has been made by the Vestry to the New River Company to give a constant supply of Water to the Parish, and to the 11 Metropolitan Board of Works to require the Company to give such constant supply, pursuant to the Metropolis Water Act, 1871; but the Company declines to take the initiative in the matter, and the Board declines to require the Company to do so. The Vestry has directed an application to be made to the Local Government Board. P.S.—The result of the further application has been that at the request of the Local Government Board the New River Company has consented to furnish a constant supply to this Parish, and have issued notices that such supply will be given in December next. PRICE AND QUALITY OF GAS. As was anticipated last year, the price of gas in the district formerly supplied by the Independent Company, was, as the result of the amalgamation with the Gas Light and Coke Company, raised from 3/4 per 1000-ft. to 3/6; but the quality was raised at the same time from about 14 to 16 candles, or about 14 per cent., which would be equal to about 6d. per 1000 feet increased value. Some correspondence is proceeding between the Vestry and the Gas Company, with a view of placing the matter of Street lighting on more satisfactory footing. GAS WORKS NUISANCE. In October last, the attention of the inhabitants in the vicinity of Haggerstone Gas Works, and also of the Sanitary Officer, was aroused by a most offensive and intolerable smell, which was found to proceed from the lime purifiers when the foul lime was being removed therefrom. This led immediately to notices being served upon the Company to abate and prevent the nuisance, and to a correspondence with the Board of Trade, the Gas Referees, and the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Company pleaded that they were bound to furnish gas of a certain purity as regards sulphur, which could only be attained by the use of lime, and the nuisance was the consequence of removing this lime after all precautions had been taken. The Gas 12 Referees were only empowered to prescribe such a degree of purity as could be furnished without the process causing a nuisance. There was, therefore, a direct conflict between the Gas Referees and the Company, and the latter sought, but unsuccessfully, to obtain relief from Parliament. The question in dispute, therefore, remains in statuo quo. There is, however, reason to believe that the great escape of foul vapour which took place in October, was the result of some accident, as it has not occurred in any marked degree during the winter, and that means have been found to mitigate, in a great measure, the evils arising from the use of lime. COST OF STREET WATERING. The Vestry resolved to give a trial to the plan of Street watering by hire of water vans for the season, and horses and drivers per day. A tender for the supply of vans was accepted from Mr. E. H. Bayley, at £15 per van for the season, and of Mr. Crane for horses and drivers at per day, and two men were employed for the season, at 27/- per week, to superintend the same. In December last, the following report was presented to the Vestry:— 1874. By Contract—Horses, carts, labour, etc. £1030 0 0 Water and meters £385 14 4 £1415 14 4 Quantity of water consumed, 7,705,000 gallons, at a cost for spreading of 2s. 8d. per 1000 gallons. 1875. By Contract—Horses, carts, labour, etc. £900 0 0 Water and meters £350 0 0 £1250 0 0 Quantity of Water consumed, 6,825,000 gallons, At a cost for spreading of about 2s. 7½d. per 1000 galls. 13 1876. By Hire—Vans and carts £177 6 0 Horses and drivers £866 11 0 Inspector's Wages £74 2 0 Water and meters £454 1 7 £1572 0 11 Quantity of water consumed, 9,233,000 gallons, at a cost for distribution of about 2s. 5d. per 1000 gallons. It being seen from these figures that the latter system was the most economical by about 3d. per 1000 gallons, and had worked more satisfactorily than the former, it was resolved to continue it for the present season (see List of Contracts taken). DISORDERLY HOUSES. Although I have issued warnings to several persons complained of for keeping improper houses, which for the most part have had effect, I have not found it necessary during the past year to take proceedings against any persons for keeping brothels. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. Appended are the reports of Dr. Stevenson, Analyst. Prosecutions were instituted and convictions obtained in eight cases. The cases and amount of fines I have marked in the Analyst's Reports. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 177 times; the Council Chamber 8 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charge. The receipts for letting were £1,119 6s. 14 VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The Number of Vestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended April 30th, 1877, is as follows:— Number of Vestry Meetings 31 Finance Committee 25 Sewers, &c., Committee 25 Valuation Committee 6 Town Hall Committee 20 Sanitary Committee 20 Improvement Committee 12 Assessment Committee 6 Appended is a list of the Contracts taken by the Vestry for the year, with other requisite information.

Gentlemen, In submitting to the Vestry a brief report of the Financial position of the Parish, with statements of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Vestry, in respect to the execution of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," during the year ending on the Twenty-fifth day of March last, as approved and certified by the several Official Auditors of the Accounts; and on reference to the statements appended, it will be seen that the sum collected during the year, as parochial rates, amounted to £110,742 12s. 2d. In the statement of the rates collected, the actual deficiency from losses, empty houses, allowances to Owners under the "Assessed Rates Acts," excusal by Magistrates, &c., &c., upon one year's assessment was £7,312, being a gross deficiency of about £6 12s. 10d., being near £6 per cent. less than that on rates closed some few years since, which is attributed to the system now adopted of a more speedy collection. 16 The other statements, shewing the Receipts and Disbursements, with the Assets and Liabilities, also an Account of Monies borrowed upon Mortgage of the rates, together, give a clear and comprehensive view of the monetary position and transactions of the Vestry. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. E. COLE, Accountant to the Vestry. Offices :— Town Hall, Old Street, June, 1877. 17 VESTRY OF SAINT LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. POOR RATE.

To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit, for your consideration, the Reports of the Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspectors for the year ending March, 1877. In the twelve months named, 5317 births—2682 males and 2635 females—were registered; and 2710 deaths. The death rate was 21.3 per 1000 living; whereas the average rate in the previous ten years was 24'3 per 1000 living. Excluding the deaths which occurred in Saint Luke's Workhouse, the death rate for this year averaged only 19-9 per 1000. It is instructive to notice the ages at which death occurred. 761 deaths, that is 28 per cent, occurred under one year of age; 1224 deaths, 45 per cent., occurred under five years of age. Similar high mortality in childhood is common to large towns, nevertheless it shows the conditions of the Parish are very destructive to young life. From 15 to 25, as is the rule, the mortality was comparatively low. Alter the age of 25, the number of deaths progressively increased 30 up to the age of 75; the largest number occurred in the decade from 65 to 75. There were only 37 deaths from 85 to 95, and 1 over 95. 29.5 per cent of the deaths occurred during the greatest activity of life, and only 7.7 per cent of the deaths occurred over 75. Seeing that the mortality is so great in childhood, and at the most useful period of life, the sanitarian may ask of the economist, is not the present system a most costly one; but is there not ample evidence, and are not the above facts of the death rate from 25 to 65 years of age, of themselves sufficient to show, that money spent in sanitary improvements, will prove more economical by saving life and maintaining labour reproduction, that is—wealth ? Of the various conditions which caused death, disease of the lungs was pre-eminent. There were 352 deaths from bronchitis and 278 from phthisis, 117 deaths from pneumonia and 68 of other forms of lung affection, making in all 815 deaths from pulmonary disease. There were 122 deaths from heart disease, and 3-46 from disease of the nervous system. Zymotic diseases caused 215 deaths, of this number there were; 12 deaths from small pox 20 „ „ measles 51 „ „ scarlet fever 89 „ „ whooping coUgh, and 25 „ „ typhoid fever. The Parish has suffered much less from small pox in the recent outbreak than in the epidemic of 1871, owing, doubtless, to the better means for isolating the infected (Asylum accommodation) and more efficient disinfection. Inspector Alexander's Report appended hereto enumerates the various improvements effected for the abatement of nuisances dangerous to health. And it shows that 260 old brick drains were removed and replaced by properly laid and connected glazed pipe ones. 31 I am led especially to call attention to these drains, because their condition endangered health; and their inspection and removal occupied much of the Sanitary Officer's time; further, the careless and injurious way in which many of the new drains were constructed showed the necessity for careful inspection. All these old drains were leaking,—owing to the bricks being much decayed and the mortar softened; some of these drains had no bottom or only loosened brick or tile bottoms, consequently the ground around them was saturated with sewage matters. The inhabitants in the houses situated over and adjacent to these drains had been evidently exposed to much annoyance and danger. And it was surprising at first sight how little health apparently had suffered. Many families had seemingly lived for months or years on, or in close vicinity to, ground charged with decomposing organic matters, and escaped severe illness. In one house, for instance, situated in Windsor Street, immediately under the kitchen floor were accumulated many gallons of thick, black, bubbling (decomposing) sewage which had escaped from an old broken brick drain which carried off the overflow from two adjoining cesspools. The earth under this kitchen, (in which persons were daily working,) and doubtless the ground, to some extent, under the house itself also, was charged with sewage matters. Yet the tenants had lived in this house for months and had had, they said, no illness. Many instances might be brought forward from the year's experience showing that drains had leaked and sewage, in or near houses, accumulated for weeks or much longer, and yet persons in such dwellings had seemingly escaped disease. I say seemingly, because increasing investigation is showing more clearly every year that many minor ailments, such as sore throat, diarrhoea, weakness, headache, febricula, and other signs of slight poisoning occur in persons thus situated. No sanitarian would deny the existence of danger in such premises; he might appeal to scores of similar instances and show that fever or other allied acute outbreak occurred when it was least apprehended. 32 General experience shows that such unexpected occurrences are common. That there is clanger, although the evil may be long deferred, was manifested in some dwellings of a street extending from Hoxton Street to Kingsland Road. The houses themselves seemed, in many respects, to be desirable residences, but it was reported to me that typhoid fever had occurred in house No. 67, in November, 1875, and again in March, 1876, and a third case of fever in May, 1876. On visiting this house, the tenants complained that for many months past they had been much annoyed by very offensive smells ascending, they thought, from the back wall and by the side of the fire-place adjoining the back wall. The closet in the yard was situated immediately in contact with the wall of the house and about two or three feet from the fire-place referred to. Beneath the closet pan was an open brick shaft from which a brick drain extended under the floor of the back parlor, in front of the fire-place into the street. The portion of this brick drain near the fire-place was very dilapidated and leaking. The rain-water pipe ended in this shaft; and the other end of the pipe was on a level with the top of the bedroom window; and the statements of the tenant left no doubt that very offensive sewage gases ascended this pipe and passed into the bedroom. But there were other dangerous conditions; the brick drain, which had scarcely any fall, discharged itself into a large receiver situated under the pavement of the street. There were several of these receivers along the street, each receiving the sewage from the houses. These receivers overflowed into the large brick drain which entered the parish sewer in Hoxton Street. Many of these house-drains were found to be almost completely filled up by sewage accumulations more or less solidified. And the drain coming from the house No. 69, in which seven cases of fever had occurred, was, at its outlet into the receiver, almost completely occluded by the solid accumulation. In these premises, therefore, were conditions most favorable for very active chemical decomposition, heat, moisture, animal substances, and defective ventilation; and such decomposition, must have afforded the germs of disease ample opportunities for unlimited multiplication. And the air in the earth under houses, warmed by the fire, must have ascended into the rooms, 33 drawing-, so to speak, the sewage gases from the leaking drains. Further, owing to the accumulation of solid matter in the drains, produced by want of proper fall and by the filling of the receiver, the sewage vapours and gases must have been subjected to much varying pressure as the liquids passed down the drain, and the gases thereby driven through the defective joints of the pipes into the dwellings. And the air in the stack pipe, colder and heavier at night, descending into the drain, must have been an additional means driving the sewage substances from the leaking drains into the house. These details are here given because they illustrate dangers to which many persons have been, and doubtless are still, exposed, and although their like is familiar to every Sanitary Authority, yet so long as typhoid fever, an admittedly avoidable disease, and its allies, continue to recur often like a scourge, and that even in houses clean and attractive looking, attention has to be directed to the causes. It is no exaggeration to say, like a scourge, when three, four, five, or more persons in a house are stricken down with typhoid fever in a few weeks. The authorities of King's College Hospital reported to your Medical Officer that five persons suffering from typhoid fever had been admitted into the hospital from a house in Albion Road, Ilaggerstone. When this house was first examined there was nothing calling attention to the drain, excepting that the sink-pipe in the back kitchen was untrapped; but when this pipe was exposed and traced it was found that it ended in a cesspool which was situated under the closet, and partly under the back kitchen floor, This cesspool was filled with thick, black sewage matters which had partly flowed away and saturated the ground under the kitchen; consequently the warmer air of the house, ascending and "drawing," whilst the colder external air pressed on this sewage accumulation, the decomposing sewage matters must have been driven into the dwelling, especially in the night. From another dwelling in Hoxton, about three years ago, five persons were removed to the fever hospital suffering from typhoid fever. On examining this house I found it in a fair condition as regards cleanliness and general arrangements. But the fever was strictly a house outbreak: I could obtain no particulars of other cases of fever in the 34 hood; nothing indicating that the outbreak had been produced by polluted water, or milk, and no contagion could be traced. The causes of the fever seemed confined to the premises of this house. The tenants complained that they had been much annoyed by "offensive smells," coming seemingly from under the yard door, more especially when they were coming down stairs in the morning. In the day time the nuisance was much less noticeable. The yard of this house was well paved, the closet pan clean and seemingly well constructed. Being satisfied from the statements given that there was something injurious in the condition of the drain, the Owner was required to take up the paving and expose the drain. In doing this, a large cesspool filled with sewage was discovered, covered over by the flagstones. It would seem that in the night, the colder air currents flowing through the ground had driven the sewage gases onwards under the flagstones until they reached the interior of the house. Not only was the health of the inhabitants of the parish endangered by the presence of a large number of old, decayed, leaking brick drains, but it was endangered also by many new drains which had been carelessly laid, regardless even of elementary mechanical principles. Their joints leaked, and in some places the pipes had been simply laid end to end, neither cement nor clay applied to keep in the seweage gases and liquids; and the pipes of some new drains had been connected at right angles to other drains, consequently the sewage streams meeting each other at right angles blocked one another, and favored deposition, which sooner or later choked up the drain and drove the gases back into the dwellings. Although in Shoreditch there has not been, at least during the past ten years, any severe and wide spread outbreak of typhoid fever, yet many cases occur yearly in the parish: and other epidemic diseases, namely, small pox and scarlet fever especially, the spread of which it is admitted is aided by the presence of decomposing animal matters, have, on more than one occasion in the last decade, prevailed disproportionately in Shoreditch; and in dwellings where the drains are defective, it is common to find not only that there has been typhoid but also other infectious diseases. 35 It is notorious that large populations have been exposed to the poisonous emanations of decomposing- animal substance for a long time and escaped zymotic disease until, as some allege, the germs of the disease were accidentally introduced, and their rapid multiplication promoted by the decomposition; or until, as others allege, a certain stage of decomposition in these animal matters allowed the infectious agencies (chemical) to come into operation. Be that as it may, it would be agreed that there is a great preventative which should be secured, and that is a free circulation of air through the ground to dissipate and destroy, by oxidation, the poisonous agencies, be they gases or other substances. And it is therefore of the utmost importance in the vicinity of dwellings, and in towns especially, to keep the surface soil dry so as to let the air circulate freely through the pores of the soil, where, as in charcoal, oxidation is promoted by the substances and the air being brought by the extremely fine subdivisions in molecular contact with one another; thus soil proves a most powerful disinfector. To secure this circulation of air in the soil and disinfection, the owners of dwellings have been required to pave their yards with impervious substance so as to keep the ground dry (I need not say water excludes the air) and, when this could not be done, the area being too great, the owners have been encouraged to turn the ground over so as to let the air and sun's heat pass freely into it. And when we consider that a house, with its warmer air ascending, acts as a large exhauster, drawing, so to speak, the air and vapour from the soil situated under and near the house, towards, and into itself, it is obvious that no effort should be spared to keep the soil dry and porous, so that immense quantities of air may be passed through the ground to dilute and destroy the poisonous substances before they reach the interior of the dwellings. That gases may thus travel very many feet through the soil and penetrate into a house is unquestionable. As a distinguished German Hy gienist says, "Remarkable testimony as to the permeability of the ground and of the foundations of our houses, has been given by gas emanations into houses which had no gas laid on. I know cases where persons were poisoned and killed by gas, which had to travel for twenty feet under the street, and then through the foundations, cellar vaults, and flooring of the ground-floor rooms. The house being 36 warmer inside than the external air, acts like a chimney on its surrounding's and chiefly on the ground on which it stands, and the air therein which we call the ground air; thus our heated houses ventilate themselves not only through the walls hut through the ground on which the house stands. If there be any gas or other smelling substance in the surrounding ground air, it will enter the current of this ventilation.' And he alludes to an instance in which the gas always penetrated into the best heated rooms and produced an illness of the inmates, which was taken for typhoid fever. Strenuous efforts have been made, especially in the last year, by the Sanitary Authorities of the Parish to prevent the ground adjoining dwellings being charged with animal matters. To effect this, not only has much attention been given to ensure that drains are secure from leakage, and to induce Owners to pave the yards of their houses, but. also other premises, namely, stables and cowhouses and such like, with their adjoining yards, have been ordered to be paved with impervious material which could be washed and swept clean, and the ground underneath kept dry. I have next to report to your Vestry what has been done in the year with dwellings dangerous to health. The Inspector's Report shows that 839 houses were inspected and 7G8 of them were in a condition endangering health. The drains of many leaked into the ground under and around. the dwellings; the roofs of many houses leaked; the floors were here and there so broken that persons were liable to be thrown down and injured; the walls damp and even wet to the hand. This dampness arose partly from the fact that the yards were not properly paved. They were paved mostly with decayed bricks, with little or on cement between them, incapable of preventing water soaking into the ground; consequently the ground under the houses being wet, and evaporation of necessity taking place from it, as the air flowed up from the ground into the houses, the walls of many of the dwellings were rendered damp, and this dampness tended to make the atmosphere of the houses injuriously moist. Moreover this dampness of the walls dangerously lessened the 37 lation of the houses; for the pores of the walls being choked with vapour, the quantity of air passing through the wall must have been diminished. Thus, the inhabitants were, to a certain extent, deprived of one of the safest means of ventilation. The circulation through the walls is one of the safest because the air is admitted in such minute and infinite streams, it causes no sensible draughts, and the air may be, to some extent, warmed and filtered as it passes through the wall. But, for this purpose of ventilation, the wall must be kept dry, and the material of the wall, as far as practicable, should be sound, whereas, in the defective houses referred to in the Inspector's Report, the wood was decomposing, and the plaster cracking, falling from the laths, and very dirty; there were in many houses no ventilators in the walls beneath the basement floors; and in many with ventilators, the joists were resting on the ground and the space between the joists, to a great extent, filled up with earth and dust. In many houses, however, air was admitted abundantly in other ways; the windows were so loose and broken,—the doors dilapidated, the walls of some cracked,—these inlets, together with the drawing influence of the chimney shafts, made many of the small rooms very draughty; and in winter the draughts were so chilling in some small houses, that the inhabitants pasted paper over the crevices of the window and stopped up the chimney shafts. It needs no words of mine to describe the evils following— they were evidenced by the warm, moist, foetid atmosphere of the rooms. It might here be asked, how is it that the Vestry has not ordered such houses to be closed as unfit for human habitation ? Many such dirty, dilapidated houses have been closed by the Vestry's orders, and not a few others are about to be closed and demolished. A great many other houses have been repaired and cleansed throughout, ventilation provided under the floors, by ventilators inserted in the walls, and a space of not less than six inches provided under the joists ; the yards paved with cement, concrete or York stone; and the closet accommodation improved and the water supply also. But the Sanitary Authorities, I need hardly say, have experienced great difficulties in their efforts to secure better dwellings for the 38 ants. Even where Owners were willing to co-operate, and I must say, with very few exceptions, they manifested that they desired to do so, the difficulties were great. Some of the houses were in the possession of persons with little monetary means and their income was derived from them; other Owners had very short leases, and such holders, it seemed, would derive little or no advantage, but probably lose much by the improvements; others altered their dwellings, but the improvements were evidently more showy than lasting. The result was not a determined effort to get rid of the disintegrating materials, but to effect changes which rather concealed than removed the evil. Your Vestry will realise that these expressions of mine are the result of many efforts and failures—and one could not but see, with disappointment and regret, that some Owners expended much money on their premises, yet failed to remove the destructive conditions; the walls were whitened and papered, whilst the plaster was cracked and disintegrating; pieces of new wood filled up the holes in the floors, but the old continued decaying and must fall away from the new. The yards were coated with cement concrete, over the old decayed bricks which continued softening, sank deeper and the cement consequently cracked and shelled off; and some Owners persisted with such proceedings, regardless of the consequences and repeated explanations of the Sanitary Officers. ' Year by year the Sanitary Authorities have been more and more convinced that the changes ordered even in Sanitary Notices, have been insufficient and even mischievous, because the alterations lasted but a short time; much money was expended, but the houses soon lapsed into a similar injurious condition. This increasing experience showed that it was wasteful to attempt to improve many of these old defective houses, because their basis materials were disintegrating and there was little hold for new substances. Some Owners, having had these facts pointed out to them by the Sanitary Committee, have pulled down and others are about to pull down the old dwellings and rebuild. ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS IMPROVEMENT ACT, 1875.—A. number.of houses, known as Cotton's Gardens and-Hudson 39 Court were reported, in accordance with this Act, by your Medical Officer of Health to the Metropolitan Board to be unfit for human habitation. The Board, as yet, have not decided to bring these dwellings under an improvement scheme. TORREN'S ACT: ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS IMPROVEMENT ACT, 1868.—Your Medical Officer also reported that the dwellings of Ann's Place were dangerous to health. That owing to their decayed and dirty condition, and to their structural defects, they were unfit for human habitation. The Surveyor, directed by your Vestry to examine these premises, as required by the Act, reported that they could not, by structural alterations, be made fit for human habitation. The Vestry therefore ordered the houses to be pulled down, but the Owner refused to carry out this order. In the next report it will be my duty to state to your Vestry the subsequent proceedings. CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY.—The Sanitary Authorities of the Parish have for several years endeavoured to obtain for the inhabitants a -constant supply of water. Many difficulties had to be overcome, but it was certain that the inhabitants, owing to the dirty condition of the receptacles, had not a proper supply of water for drinking purposes. Your Vestry therefore requested the Metropolitan Board, empowered by the Water Act, to direct the New River Company to give a constant supply to the Parish of Shoreditch. The Metropolitan Board declined to make the required order; and the New River Company, when requested by your Vestry, declined to put the Water Act in operation and introduce the constant supply until they were ordered to do so by the Metropolitan Board or the Local Government Board. 40 Subsequently, the Company, when requested by the Local Government Board, resolved to introduce the constant supply throughout the Parish, and are now taking measures to do so. This change must cause Owners considerable expense, yet when it is considered how indispensable it is for health that the inhabitants should have unpolluted water, I can have no doubt that the change will be very beneficial, and in a little while Owners of dwellings will be thankful that the old, dirty receptacles are discarded, at least for drinking purposes. SLAUGHTER HOUSES are now under the regulations of the Metropolitan Board, and supervised by the Board's Inspector. Should any of these premises, however, cause a nuisance injurious to health, the Vestry can, under the "Nuisance Removal Act," direct its abatement. During the past year no complaint has been made against such premises. COW-HOUSES.—Inspector Fletcher reports to me that there are 40 cow-houses in the parish, and 460 cows in these premises. No new licenses granted in the year. The cow-houses are now under regulations made by the Vestry, and the premises are better ventilated, paved, and much less overcrowded. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON. 41 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following' report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ending March 25th, 1877, showing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. An inspection of water receptacles, ordered by the Sanitary Committee, in connection with the application to the "Local Government Board" for constant water supply, was made, and a Special Report thereon was presented, giving in detail the condition of the water receptacles in 2549 premises House to house visitation; and premises specially inspected with reference to complaints made „ 839 „ Premises on which Notices were served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health „ 768 „ 42 WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES. Glazed pipe drains provided in lieu of dilapidated brick ones in 260 premises Defectively constructed pipe drains repaired or relaid „ 96 „ Drains provided where there were none before „ 37 „ Cesspools emptied and filled up „ 39 „ Stack pipes having their heads dangerously close to the bedroom windows, permitting sewer gas to pass into the dwellings disconnected from drains „ 100 „ Waste pipes and sinks within doors (untrapped and permitting sewer gas to impregnate the dwellings) have been securely trapped, or otherwise disconnected from drains, and have now their ends in the open air, and immediately over yard sinks „ 115 „ Roofs repaired „ 58 „ Flooring repaired „ 85 „ Stairs ,, ,, 55 ,, Walls and ceilings cleansed, whitened and repaired throughout ,, 195 ,, in part ,, 33 ,, Ventilation provided under ground floor „ 67 „ Water closets (foul and dilapidated) cleansed and repaned ,, 553 ,, Water supply provided to closets „ 303 „ Dust bins provided ,, 163 „ Yards paved imperviously with stone or cement concrete „ 446 „ To ensure the work done, being as far as possible, of a durable character, many re-inspections had to be made, which took up much time, resulting however in the Owners having their work generally well done. A few instances may be mentioned in detail, to show the manner of proceedure, and the nature of the work accomplished. MARY STREET, KINGSLAND ROAD.—Fever having broken out in several of the houses in this street, led to a house to house 43 inspection, when it was found that each of the 76 houses had a separate brick drain passing under living and sleeping rooms, to the sewer in front of the houses. These drains were all of defective character, causing thereby the lower rooms to be impregnated with sewer gas, and infested with rats. The closets were without water, and, with the exception of one, all those on the north side were untrapped; there was under each closet pan an open brick shaft which discharged into the defective drain. These brick shafts and the closet pans were very foul. They were generally close to bedroom windows and smelled very offensively. The rain water pipes were all connected with the drains, and the heads of all these pipes were in close proximity to the first floor bedroom windows. The dust bins were in many instances placed immediately under the bedroom windows. The small yards were defectively paved and consequently foul. The sinks . were generally untrapped, and drinking water was stored in small uncovered butts, many of which were very foul, and rotten. Notices were served requiring the abatement of these nuisances; in compliance with which the owners has removed all the brick drains, and substituted stoneware pipe drains. The closets have all been cleansed and repaired, and water has been laid on to them. The yards have been paved with cement concrete, and fitted with proper dished and trapped receptacles for surface drainage and house slops. The rain water pipes have all been disconnected from the drains, portable dust boxes have been provided, and finally a constant supply of water from the main has been given to each house. No. 23, WINDSOR STREET, WENLOCK ROAD.—Under the kitchen floor was found an accumulation of stagnant sewage several feet deep, ascertained to be forced upwards from a large dilapidated brick barrell drain lying at a depth of 6 feet below the floor; as the owner refused to remove this drain, and had filled in a quantity of rubbish on the top of it, the premises were entered, under the Chairman's authority, and the drain and all sewage matter removed by the Vestry's 44 builder, it was then ascertained to be an overflow drain of two cesspools (since emptied) situated on the premises Nos. 24 and 25, adjoining. Costs were recovered at Worship Street Police Court. Nos. 157 to 189, NEW NORTH ROAD, all belonging to separate Owners. The drain common to Nos. 157 and 189, and the fourteen intervening premises, being ascertained to be a very dilapidated brick barrell, lying very flat and shallow and being moreover filled up with sewage, and causing great nuisances on several premises, it was necessary that this old drain should be entirely removed; and it was desirable that a new common drain should be constructed following the course of the old one,—rather than each owner should be compelled to provide a separate drain. The Vestry, recognising the impossibility of so many owners doing this work in a satisfactory manner, employed their Contractor, who removed the old drain and replaced it by a 12-inch stoneware pipe drain. The owners agreeing in writing to pay costs. GRANVILLE BUILDINGS, LUKE STREET.-In these model dwellings there are 106 suites of apartments, each suite having a separate water supply, closet accommodation, and scullery sink, all these arrangements were found to be of defective and injurious construction. In twenty of the suites the cisterns holding drinking water were placed immediately over the water closets of apartments to which they belonged, and immediately under the water closets of the apartments above, with no effectual cover to prevent any water or soil which might overflow the closet pan above, from polluting the drinking water below. Many of the tenants complained of the taste and smell of water obtained from these cisterns. The closets in the other suites were in bad repair. The overflow of pans, or the leaking of defective traps of pans, caused great nuisances in many instances by saturating the apartments below. The waste pipes to sinks were small, and constructed with many sharp angles, which caused frequent stoppages, and 45 great annoyances to persons in having their apartments saturated with foul water. Notices were served on the owners requiring the abatement of these nuisances, in compliance with which the closets have been thoroughly repaired, water has been laid on, and the floor of eaeh closet has been paved with cement concrete. Tenants are thus largely protected from carelessness of neighbours, and from results of accident to the closet arrangements in the apartments above. The injuriously situated cisterns have been removed, water is now obtained from large cisterns placed on the roofs, and large efficient waste pipes have been provided throughout. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HABITATION.—The two-roomed houses in Rose Street, Curtain Road, Nos. 1 to 8, and Nos. 12 to 22, whose dilapidated and injurious condition was frequently under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee, have been demolished, after much delay conceded to the owner in consideration of his expressed intention to rebuild. Small workshops and dwellings are being built on the site, The two-roomed houses, Nos. 43 to 54, Charlotte Street, Old Street, and the houses Nos. 7 to 15, Mill's Court, adjoining, were old, damp, and dilapidated structures throughout. The owner, being required by notice to render these dwellings fit for habitation, considered it more advantageous to pull them down. A superior class of property is now being built on their site. The premises known as Barne's Yard, Edward Street, Hoxton, including the houses Nos. 1, 2, and 3, which were so foul and dilapidated as to be unfit for human habitation, and the stables, which being unpaved and undrained, were injurious to health, have been closed in accordance with the Vestry's order (and since demolished). The dilapidated two-roomed houses, 47 in number, belonging to the "Earl of Wintcrton," and situated in the 46 Vinegar Ground, have been closed in accordance with the Vestry's order, and model dwellings are now being erected on their site. The dilapidated two-roomed houses, 10 in number, situate in Mail Coach Yard, Kingsland Road, which were so foul and dilapidated as to be unfit for human habitation, have been closed in accordance with the Vestry's order. Only two Police Court summonses were taken out during the year; one for recovery of costs of drain-work done by the Vestry's order; and the other to obtain an order for abatement of nuisances. The Magistrate made the order applied for on behalf of the Vestry in both cases. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. ALEXANDER, Sanitary Inspector. 47 INSPECTOR FLETCHER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg leave to report to you that during the year ending March 25th, 1877, the conditions named below have caused nuisances dangerous to health, and were inspected and remedied under my supervision. Corpses decomposing, removed from dwellings 10 Closet drains obstructed, and repaired and cleansed 18 Water supply re-instated in 39 dwellings Surface wells ordered to be abolished in 4 premises Accumulations of dung, &c., removed from 18 „ Carriage and footways—(on private property) — paved in 29 „ Rooms overcrowded in 11 dwellings MINOR NUISANCES.—Nuisances in dwellings not referred to Inspector Alexander (little alteration only needed) such as defects in roofs, floors, yards, &c. 21 48 REMOVAL OF DUST.—During the past year the dust on the whole has been better removed from the parish. There have been few complaints from the inhabitants of non-removal; and I visited a large number of premises, and found few dust accumulations requiring my interference. The details here given shew the number of applications at the Town Hall for the removal of dust, from March, 1871, to March, 1877:— Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1st. 2nd. 3rd. 1871-2 2607 82 31 4465 449 178 1872-3 1772 35 2 3091 125 12 1873-4 2030 99 9 2718 175 14 1874-5 1897 72 2 5023 295 21 1875-6 1714 32 2 3741 67 2 1876-7 856 5 - 1792 2 - The plan of exposing the letter D in the front window when an inhabitant requires the dust removed has answered on the whole; but the dustmen have not attended regularly in the respective streets on the days named in the contract. COW-HOUSES.—There are 40 cow-houses in the parish—20 in the Eastern Division, and 20 in the Western Division. In the cow-houses of the Eastern Division there were (at the time of my inspection) 200 cows; and in the Western, 260—making a total of 460. The average cubic space for each cow in the sheds throughout the parish was 790 (measured) as against 698 of the previous year. I inspected every cow-house at least four times during the year, and on the whole I found them fairly kept. 49 NUISANCES DANGEROUS TO HEALTH CONSEQUENT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES.—The following details shew the sanitary measures adopted where cases of contagious diseases occurred. No. of infected houses inspected and disinfected 226 „ rooms disinfected by sulphur fumegation and æration 303 Occupiers required to disinfect articles liable to retain infection in 226 premises No. of infected beds disinfected, at the Vestry's disinfecting oven 85 „ pillows ditto ditto 111 „ mattrasses ditto ditto 23 ,, bolsters ditto ditto 50 * * „ other articles ditto ditto 177 Of the above cases 108 were of small pox. This disease first appeared in August, 1876. It occurred at No. 2, Vine Place, Hoxton Street. Eight persons of one family were attacked with small pox in this house, and only one died, all the patients were promptly removed to the hospital. Every effort was made to prevent the spread of the disease by isolation, and disinfection of the dwelling houses, drains, and gullies in the street and neighbouring courts, under my personal superintendance, and it is satisfactory to know that no further case of small pox occurred in the neighbourhood for several months afterwards. 78 of the above cases were removed to the small pox hospital, 17 of which proved fatal; the remaining 30 persons were not removed, and 12 died. The inspection of infected premises has involved much time and attention. Sanitary notices have been served on the owners and occupiers requiring them, to cleanse and disinfect the houses; and the rooms occupied by the sick have been further disinfected by sulphur fumigation, and the bedding and clothing disinfected. The new disinfecting apparatus came into use in January last, and appears to now answer satisfactory. 50 I desire to report that the Vestry's disinfecting and removal officer (Mr. Edwards) has given great assistance in these and other duties connected with the Sanitary Department. I have also superintended the scavenging and watering of the roads, and devoted much time to the purchase of articles for analysis, under the " Adulteration of Food and Drug Act." I am, Sir Your obedient Servant, H. R. FLETCHER, Sanitary Inspector. 51 APPENDIX A. SITUATION OF THE URINALS IN THE PAEISH. 1. Sclater-street, Shoreditch (Slate and Iron) s . 2.
