Sir, Madam, and Gentlemen, Herewith I have pleasure in submitting for your consideration my Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of your Parish during the year 1896. It will be found to contain a large amount of information respecting not only the diseases which were prevalent during the year 1896, but also, for comparative purposes, those which had existed during the preceding eleven years. The most notable events of the year were the epidemic of Measles and the extraordinary action of the School Board in failing to assist the Parish officials in checking it, the outbreak of Small Pox, and the extensive prevalence of Diphtheria. I would also draw your particular attention to the large amount of good work performed by your Sanitary Inspectors, as well as by your Inspectors of Factories and Workshops, and also to the great success which has attended the weekly removal of dust (vide Table K in Appendix). I am, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health Public Health Department, Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., 31st May, 1897. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1896. AREA, POPULATION AND DENSITY OF THE PARISH. Area.—The area of the Parish of Islington is 3,109 acres, of which 1,028 form the sub-registration district of Upper Holloway, 813 form South-west Islington, 463 South-east Islington, and 805 Highbury. Population.—On the night of the 29th of March the first quinquennial census of Islington, in common with the rest of London, was taken, the result of which was as follows:— Upper Holloway 98,273 inhabitants. Islington, South-west 107.365 „ „ South-east 66,549 „ Highbury 64,577 „ The Parish 336,764 „ This is an increase of 17,621 persons on the number taken at the census of 1891, when the parishioners numbered 319,143. Census 1896 336,764 „ 1891 319,143 Increase 17,621 8 1896 Taking the new population as the basis of calculation, it is estimated there were 337,661 persons living in the Parish at the middle of the year. Previous to the March census the Registrar-General, basing his calculations on the censuses of 1881 and 1891, assumed that the population would have reached 340,010. It was, however, found that this latter figure was incorrect, for the estimate on the revised basis did not reach this number by 2,349. Estimate on basis of censuses 1881 and 1891 340,010 „ „ „ 1891 and 1896 337,661 Overestimate 2,349 In the last enumeration it was ascertained that the increase in the intercural period (5 years) had been the smallest on record, being only 5.5 per cent., equal to a decennial increase of 11.0 per cent., and in this view the following comparative figures are very interesting. Table I. Census Years. Populations. Actual Increase. Increase per cent. Natural Increase (excess of Births over Deaths). 1841 55,776 — — — 1861 95,239 39,463 70.7 — 1861 155,341 60,102 63.1 16,906 1871 213,749 68,408 37.1 22,786 1881 282,865 69,116 32.3 43,639 1891 319,143 36,278 12.8 44,768 1896 (6 years) 336,764 17,621 5.5 19,230 In all probability this diminution in the increase will continue until the time, which cannot be far distant, when, as in other parts of the Metropolis, fully built on, a positive decrease will occur. 9 [1896 Of the total increase between the two census periods (1891 and 1896) it was found that— 45.61 per cent. occurred in Upper Holloway. 30.55 „ „ Highbury. 13.56 „ Islington, South-east. 10.26 „ „ Islington, South-west. From these figures it is seen that the most rapidly increasing districts are Upper Holloway and Highbury. This is accounted for by the fact that they have not been completely built on. Any increase that has occurred in Islington South-west, or in Islington South-east, which have been almost covered with houses, has been the result of the greater crowding of the people. It will be recollected that at this last enumeration of the parish the ages were not taken, and it is therefore impossible, to compile an age table on a basis later than that of 1891, at which period the population was distributed as follows:— Persons under 5 years numbered 118 per 1,000 of population. „ between 5 and 15 years ,, 206 „ „ „ ,, ,, 15 „ 25 „ „ 200 „ ,, ,, ,, ,, 25 „ 35 ,, „ 172 „ „ ,, ,, ,, 35 ,, 45 ,, ,, 124 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 45 ,, 55 „ „ 87 ,, „ „ ,, ,, 55 ,, 65 ,, „ 54 „ ,, ,, ,, ,, 65 ,, 75 ,, „ 28 ,, ,, ,, ,, above 75 ,, „ 11 „ ,, ,, It is not supposed, however, that the proportion as to ages and sex can have materially altered in the five years, and, therefore, it becomes possible to construct a table which is believed to be fairly accurate, and which is, therefore, used for the purposes of this report. 10 1896] Table II. Showing the estimated number of Persons living in the Parish at the middle of 1896, at nine different Age Periods, and distinguishing Males and Females. 1896. Ages. Males. Females.

Upper Holloway 98,682 persons Islington, South-west 107,457 „ „ South-east 66,671 „ Highbury 64,851 „ The Parish 337,661 „ It is on these figures that the several birth-rates and death-rates have been calculated. A correction, however, has been made owing to the registration year containing 53 weeks, as otherwise the rates could not be compared with preceding years in which there were only 52 weeks. 11 [1896 Density.—It has often been remarked in previous reports that the density of the population of Islington is much greater than that of any of the 33 Great Towns of the country, and in this respect labours under a distinct disadvantage, because great density and high deathrates frequently run hand in hand. At the present time there are 109 persons living on each acre of the Parish, a number which is far exceeded in the two sub-registration districts of Islington South-west and Islington South-east, where the density of population is respectively 132 and 144 persons per acre. Table IV. Showing the Area and Density of the several sub-districts and of the Parish. Sub-Districts. Area in Acres. Persons to an Acre, Acres to a Person.

This is seen in the following table in which they are placed in order from the least to the greatest density. 12 1896] Table V.

There were 9,921 births registered in the 53 weeks constituting the year 1896, of which 5,054 were males and 4,867 females. These were equal to an annual birth-rate of 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants, as against a rate of 29.6 in the preceding year, which was also the mean rate that had obtained in the five years 1891-5. It will be seen from the following table that the birth-rate of the parish does not keep up to the high level of former years. The causes of the decrease were discusscd in the Annual Report for 1895, and it is, therefore, now only necessary to notice the fact. Table VIII.

Liverpool 34.9 „ Manchester 33.0 „ Leeds 30.7 „ Sheffield 34.0 „ In the three succeeding Tables full particulars are given as to the births and birth-rates in the several quarters of the year, to which are added for comparative purposes the birth-rates that obtained in London and the 33 great towns.

All Causes. The number of deaths from all diseases in 1896 was 5,884, of which 3,059 were males and 2,825 females. In the preceding year 5,760 deaths* were registered, so that making an allowance for the fact that there were 53 weeks in the registration year the numbers are almost identical, the difference being only 14 in favour of 1895. The 5,884 deaths compare favourably with the corrected mean number registered in the eleven years 1885-95, which, as shown in the following return was 6,246. Years. Deaths.

The death-rate is also below the standard death-rate of the Parish, which is 17.90.† * There deaths are at the rate of 5,870 deaths in a year of 53 weeks. † Vide note Table XIV., page 23. B 2 20 1896] The previous death-rates of the Parish have averaged in the several decennial periods— 1841-50 19.5 per 1,000 inhabitants 1851-60 21.0 „ „ 1861-70 22.0 „ „ 1871-80 21.9 „ „ 1881-90 18.5 „ „ The death-rate in the 33 Great Towns was 19.1 per 1,000 inhabitants, and was 1.6 below the mean rate for the preceding ten years. The Islington death-rate is 2.0 per 1,000 below this rate. Compared with the very great populous towns, that is to say, those whose population exceeds 200,000 inhabitants, it is seen that Islington stands in a good position, for West Ham, Bradford and Bristol alone showed lower death-rates. Again, when the Islington death-rate is contrasted with those of the districts which encircle it, it is found that the rates of only Stoke Newington, Hackney and Hornsey were less, while those of St. Pancras, Clerkenwell, St. Luke and Shoreditch were greater, than it.

It has been pointed out in previous reports that this is not an absolutely fair criterion of the health of a district, especially when comparisons are made with other places, because the distribution of the ages as well as the sexes is different in every district. Thus for instance, in one district there may be 136 persons in every 1,000 of the population under five years, while in another there may be 150 in every 1,000. Similar differences are to be found at every age, and, in fact, to put it shortly, no two places have their populations cast in an identical manner. Consequently, before an exact comparison can be made the crude death-rate must be corrected. This has been done in the two following Tables. In the Table XIII. showing the death-rate in the London districts it is seen that when the crude death-rates are compared, Islington stands in the fifteenth place, but when the corrected death-rates are contrasted it stands in the twelfth place. Similarly in Table XIV. showing the mortality rates in the 33 Great Towns the position of Islington in the list is changed from twelfth to ninth place. 22 1896] Table XIII.

It will be noticed that Table XIV. in this Report shows the contrast between England and Wales and other places. This has been done in order that Islington and the other London districts might be compared with the great towns, as well as with each other. MORTALITY IN THE SUB-REGISTRATION DISTRICTS. Upper Holloway. 1,603 deaths were registered, which are equal to the low annual death-rate of 15.93 per 1,000 inhabitants. These deaths are 91 below the average number of deaths registered in the preceding four years. 1892 2,053 deaths = 22.30 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1893 7,702 „ = 18.14 „ 1894 1,458 „ = 15.30 „ 1895 1,564 „ = 16.12 „ 1896 1,603 „ = 16.93 „ The death-rate of the district from all causes of death must be considered satisfactory, in the face of the fact that it suffered more than any other sub-district, except south-west Islington, from Zymotic Diseases. Such a district as Upper Holloway is fairly comparable with many of the 33 Great Towns, whose populations are about the same in number. In every instance, however, the death-rates in these places is above the rate that obtained there. Population. Death-rate. Plymouth 90,276 19.6 per 1,000 inhabitants.

There were 2,099 deaths registered as against 2,023 in the preceding year, and an average of 1,963 in the four years 1892-95. When, however, allowance is made for the fact that there were 53 weeks in the year, it is found that the comparison is between 2,023 and 2,001, representing an increase of 22 in the return under review. The death-rate was 1916 per 1,000 inhabitants. This district may be compared to the following Great Towns, whose populations range from 100,000 to 115,000, as its population is estimated at 107,457. Population. Death-rate. Norwich 108,630 17.4 per 1,000 inhabitants.

South-east Islington. There were 1,185 deaths registered, as against 1,234 deaths in the preceding year, and an average of 1,187 in the four years 1892—95. When this latter figure is corrected so as to afford a contrast with a year of 53 weeks it becomes 1,210; the present mortality return is 23 below it. The death-rate was 17.44 per 1,000 inhabitants, which for a mixed population like that of this district is very good. It is impossible to contrast its death-rate with those of any of the great towns, because there is none whose population is so small. There 26 1896] are several of the lesser towns, however, of about its size, and I append their death-rates:— Population. Persons to an acre. Death-rate. Southampton 87,370 43.6 18.6 Reading 66,739 11.4 13.6 Northampton 66,432 50.7 15.8 York 70,867 19.0 18.1 Merthyr Tidfil 64,591 3.6 21.2 Islington, South-east 66,671 144.0 17.4 Highbury. 997 deaths were recorded as against 939 in 1895, and an average of 931 in the preceding four years. The latter figure becomes 949 on correction for 53 weeks, so that the present return is 48 in excess of the average. Nevertheless it is very good, for it represents a death-rate of only 15.08 per 1,000 inhabitants, a rate which contrasts very favourably with those towns about the size of Highbury, which I mentioned when dealing with Islington South-west.

The deaths of 523 persons who had come from other districts of London for treatment in the Public Institutions of Islington are excluded from those returns. SEASONAL MORTALITY. The least healthy period of the year was the first quarter, in which 1,664 deaths were registered—equal to a death-rate of 19.71 per 1,000, and the most healthy was the third quarter, in which 1,336 deaths occurred, and in which the death-rate was 15.82. In the second quarter the deaths numbered 1,382, the death-rate being 16.37; and in the fourth quarter the deaths were 1,502 and the death-rate 16.52. 1st Quarter 1,664 deaths = 19.71 2nd ,,1,382 „ = 16.37 3rd „ 1,336 „ = 15.82 4th „ 1,502 „ =16.52 The Year 5,884 „ = 17.09 An inspection of these death-rates shows that, with the exception of the first quarter, they were fairly equal at each period. First Quarter.— Although the number of deaths registered was above those of the other quarters of the year, yet when compared with the first quarter returns of the preceding 11 years it is found that it is 29 [1896 115 below the corrected average for those periods. The figures stand thus— Corrected mean number of deaths 1885—95 1,805 deaths = 21.38 death-rate. No. of deaths registered 1896 1,664 ,, = 19.71 ,, Difference 141 „ = 1.07 „ Under these circumstances, the death-rate in the first quarter cannot be considered unsatisfactory. The death-rate was only very slightly above those of the 33 great towns and of London, which respectively enjoyed a rate of 19.5 and 19.2 per 1,000. It was, however, 1.74 per 1,000 above the rate which obtained in the districts encircling the parish. The excess in the death-rate was entirely due to the presence of Measles, which, while causing 288 deaths, produced a death-rate of 2.00 per 1,000 inhabitants. Had it not been for this epidemic, the first quarter would have been the healthiest on record. At this period the highest death-rate, 21.22 per 1,000, in the sub-districts was registered in South-west Islington. The lowest deathrate occurred in Highbury, where it was 16.93 per 1,000, while in Upper Holloway it was 19.28, and in South-east Islington 20.83. Second Quarter.—The returns showed that 1,382 persons died, of whom 728 were males and 654 females. These deaths were 39 below the corrected average for the corresponding period for eleven years. The deaths were equal to an annual death-rate of 16.37 per 1,000, a rate which compared very favourably with the death-rates registered throughout the country. Thus, in England and Wales it was 17.1 per 1,000, in the 33 Great Towns 18.9, in London 17.4, and the Encircling Districts 16.5 per 1,000. Measles in this, as in the preceding, quarter was prevalent and disturbed the death-rate to the extent of nearly 1.00 (actually 0.99) per 1,000. It is right, however, to say that this disease had borne a bad record during the eleven previous second quarters, producing a mean deathrate of 1.03 per 1,000 inhabitants. 30 1896] Third Quarter.—1,336 deaths, 712 being males and 624 females, were registered. These were 39 below the average number, corrected for increase of population, registered during the corresponding third quarters of the eleven preceding years. The mortality rate was satisfactory, whether as compared with the country at large, the Great Towns, London, or with the districts encircling the parish, for it was below that of each of these places. It was 0.5 below the rate that prevailed in England and Wales, 3.2 below the rale of the 33 Great Towns, 1.0 below that of the 67 Other Large Towns, 2.5 below the London rate, and 33 below the rate of the Encircling Districts. At this period the death-rate was as low as 14.25 in Highbury, 14.59 in Upper Holloway, and 15.18 in South-east Islington, while in South-west Islington it was only relatively high at 18.31. In this quarter diarrhœa was prevalent and influenced the deathrate to the extent of 1.56 per 1,000. It was partly owing to the fact that this rate was below the rate experienced in other places that the Islington general death-rate was so good. The return, 132 deaths from Diarrhœa, was very satisfactory, for it was not only 9 below that of the corresponding period of last year, but also 32 below the corrected average for the preceding 11 years. This disease, like Enteric Fever, is peculiarly amenable to sanitation, and it is, therefore, a most welcome fact to find that the decrease is so substantial. When the comparison is made between the two sexennial periods 1885-90 and 1891-96, the reduction, notwithstanding a greatly increased population, is very striking, being no less than 239. 1885, 3rd Quarter 167 deaths. 1886, „ 272 „ 1887, „ 280 „ 1888, „ 116 „ 1889, „ 137 „ 1890, „ 112 „ 1885-90, „ 1,084 „ Mean, „180 „ 1891, 3rd Quarter 115 deaths. 1892, „ 135 „ 1893, „ 154 „ 1894, „ 68 „ 1895, „141 „ 1896, „132 „ 1891-96, „ 745 „ Mean, ,, 122 „ The death-rate for the third quarter was equal to an annual rate of 1.56 per 1,000, and was lower than the death-rate of the whole country, 31 [1896 and considerably lower than that of either the 33 Great Towns, the 67 other Large Towns, London, or than any of the Encircling Districts, Hornsey excepted. The following was the record of these places:— England and Wales 1.58 per 1,000 inhabitants. 33 Great Towns 2.50 ,, ,, 67 Other Large Towns 1.94 ,, ,, London 2.38 ,, ,, Encircling Districts 2.98 ,, ,, St. Pancras 2.50 ,, ,, Stoke Newington 2.74 ,, ,, Hackney 2.98 ,, ,, Hornsey 1.29 „ ,, Clerkenwell 4.48 ,, ,, St. Luke 4.25 „ ,, Shoreditch 3.64 „ „ Islington 1.56 „ „ The death-rates of the Great Towns whose population exceed 200,000 were, with exception of Bristol and Bradford, above the Islington rate. In the Parish the deaths in the several sub-districts were:— Deaths. Death-rates. Upper Holloway 38 1.54 per 1,000 inhabitants. South-west Islington 46 1.71 ,, ,, South-east ,, 26 1.56 ,, ,, Highbury 22 1.36 „ ,, The Parish 132 1.56 ,, „ This return shows that the death-rates of the several sub-districts were in no way excessive. Deaths. Death-rates. Upper Holloway 38 = 1.54 per 1,000 inhabitants. South-west Islington 46 = 1.71 ,, ,, South-east „ 26 = l.56 ,, „ Highbury 22 = 1.36 „ ,, The Parish 132 = 1.56 ,, „ Diarrhœa began to show itself in a fatal form during the week ending June 20th, when 3 deaths were registered. These were followed in the following week by 4. The disease reached its highest point during its sixth week, when it caused 26 deaths, from which time it slowly decreased to the end of the third quarter. 32 1896] The following table gives the deaths and death-rates in each of the districts, as well as the chief meteorological conditions which prevailed during the period:— Table XIX.

The total number of deaths was 1,502, of which 776 were males and 726 were females. This number was 138 below the average (1,640) registered in the fourth quarters of the preceding eleven years, after corrections had been made for increased population and the fact that the quarter contained fourteen weeks. The death-rate was equal to 16.52 per 1,000 of the population, as against an average rate during the corresponding fourth quarters of the preceding eleven years of 18.03. In whatever light the death-rate for the quarter is viewed, it must be considered most satisfactory for a large and very densely populated place like Islington. It is below the death-rate that prevailed in England and Wales (17.9), in the 33 Great Towns (18.8), in the 67 Other Large Towns (18.2), in Rural England (17.1), in London (17.7), and in the Encircling Districts (17.5). In the sub-districts of the parish the several death-rates were also satisfactory; thus, in Upper Holloway the rate was 14.60 per 1,000, in South-west Islington 18.52, in South-east Islington 17.49, and in Highbury 15.12.

Diphtheria and Whooping Cough were most fatally prevalent in the second quarter, Smallpox in the third, and Enteric Fever in the third and fourth quarters. c 2 36 1896] Diarrhœal Diseases caused most deaths in the third quarter. The periods at which the other classified diseases were most fatal are shown in the Table. A very full statement will be found in Table VII. in the appendices of the four quarterly reports, so that it is not now necessary to recapitulate them. Moreover, a very full synopsis of the deaths from all causes in each quarter is given in Table C in the appendix of this report. DEATHS FROM THE PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. There were 1,026 deaths registered from these diseases, as against a corrected average of 885 during the preceding eleven years and 639 in the preceding year. The death-rate was equal to 2.98 per 1,000 of the population, compared with a rate of 2.57 in the years 1885-95, consequently it was 0.41 in excess of the mean death-rate that obtained during these years. The chief factors in the disturbance of the death-rate were Measles, Diphtheria and Whooping Cough, each of which were more prevalent than usual. Table XXIII. Showing the Deaths from the principal Zymotic Diseases for the Eleven years 1885-95 and in 1896. Years. Deaths. Deathrates. Years. Deaths.

On the other hand, it is gratifying to notice that such diseases as Enteric Fever and Diarrhœa, which are the two diseases most amenable to improved sanitation, show a decreased mortality. It should be stated that the Zymotic death-rate of the country was generally in excess of the average of the preceding 10 years. The following is a statement of the death-rates in other populous places:— England and Wales 2.18 per 1,000 inhabitants. 33 Great Towns 2.86 „ „ 67 Other Large Towns 2.51 „ ,, Rural England and Wales. 1.60 „ „ Registration London 3.11 „ „ The Encircling Districts 2.96 „ „ St. Pancras 2.47 „ „ Stoke Newington 2.35 ,, ,, Hackney 2.81 „ „ Hornsey 1.15 „ „ Clerkenwell 3.78 „ „ St. Luke 3.82 „ „ Shoreditch 4.31 „ „ Islington 2.98 ,, ,, From these figures it does not appear that the Islington death-rate was greatly in excess of other populous places. Thus, it was only slightly higher than the rate that prevailed in the 33 great towns, and was actually less than that of London, while it was practically identical 38 1896] with the death-rate of the Encircling Districts, and even considerably below some of them. The death-rates of the Greatest Towns, that is to say, those whose populations exceed 200,000, show the Islington rate in a more favourable light. Zymotic Death-rate. West Ham 3.00 per 1,000 inhabitants. Bristol 1.90 ,, „ Birmingham 3.57 ,, „ Nottingham 2.47 ,, „ Liverpool 3.01 ,, „ Manchester 3.42 ,, „ Salford 4.10 ,, „ Bradford 1.58 „ „ Leeds 2.28 ,, „ Sheffield 2.91 ,, „ Hull 3.32 ,, „ Newcastle-on-Tyne 2.08 ,, „ Islington 2.98 ,, „ Here it is seen that no less than six of these populous places had higher Zymotic death-rates than this parish. Of the London sanitary areas 23 were in a worse position than Islington, viz., Fulham (3.6), Chelsea (3.9), Marylebone (3.2), Holborn (3.2), Clerkenwell (3.8), St. Luke (3.8), Shoreditch (4.3). Bethnal Green (4.2), St. George-in-the-East (3.3), Limehouse (4.0), Mile End Old Town (3.6), Poplar (3.7), St. Saviour, Southwark (3.2), St. George, Southwark (4.2), Newington (3.3), St. Olave, Southwark (4.8), Bermondsey (3.8), Rotherhithe (3.8), Battersea (3.6), Camberwell (3.6), Greenwich (3.7), Woolwich (3.9), and Plumstead (3.5). The 1,026 deaths from Zymotic diseases were described to the several diseases in the following table, which also shows the corrected mean number registered in the preceding eleven years:— 39 [1896 Table XXIV.

There were 307 deaths—equal to an annual death-rate of 2.98 per 1,000 inhabitants—registered in the above district during the year, as against 199, 231 and 246 in the three years immediately preceding. The increased deaths were chiefly due to Measles, Diphtheria and Whooping Cough, the two latter diseases being especially prevalent, and producing death-rates of 0.85 and 0.86 per 1,000 inhabitants. The deaths from the several diseases since 1893, together with the deaths and death-rates in 1896, were as follows:— 40 1896]  1893. Deaths. 1894. Deaths. 1895. Deaths. 1896. Deaths. Death-rates.

The death-rate from Diphtheria was almost identical with that which prevailed in South-west Islington, where it amounted to 0.86 per 1,000 inhabitants. South-west Islington. The returns gave 379 deaths, which is an increase on each of the three preceding years, in which there were respectively registered 239, 322 and 340 deaths. The death-rate for the year was 3.46 per 1,000 of the district population. Here, also, Measles, Diphtheria and Whooping Cough were the diseases which caused the increase. The first mentioned ailment was especially fatal, causing no less than 141 deaths, or a deathrate of l.29 per 1,000 of the population; a rate which was almost twice that of any other sub-district. Diphtheria was also in excess, the number of deaths being 95, and the death-rate 086, which is just a small fraction higher than that which prevailed in Upper Holloway. The several diseases and the resulting death-rates during 1896, together with the deaths during the preceding three years, were as follows:— 41 [1896  1893. 1894. 1896. 1896. Deaths. Deaths. Deaths.

In this district, as in the others already mentioned, the deaths from Measles, Diphtheria and Whooping Cough were the chief factors in the increased mortality. In proportion to the population these diseases were 0.79, 0.53 and 0.72 per 1,000. The death-rate from Measles was only exceeded by the rate experienced in South-west Islington, while that from Whooping Cough was only less than the rate in Upper Holloway.

There were 149 deaths ascribed to the Zymotic Diseases in Highbury, representing a death-rate of 2.25 per 1,000 inhabitants. This was the lowest death-rate registered in any of the sub-districts. The most fatal diseases were Measles, with a death-rate of 0.60 per 1,000, Diphtheria of 0.45, and Whooping Cough 0.48.

MORTALITY FROM THE SEVERAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES. SMALL POX. Only one death from Small Pox was recorded during the year, as against an annual average, corrected for increase of population for eleven years, of 14. This death occurred in the third quarter of the year, and in the sub-registration district of Upper Holloway. The patient, a male, aged eight years, was unvaccinated. 44 1896] Table XXVII.

In 1895 there were 135 deaths. The 288 deaths were equal to a death-rate of 0.83 per 1,000 inhabitants. The particulars as to the deaths and death-rates in the several Sub-districts and in the Parish are given in the two following Tables. Table XXIX.

Indeed, Measles slowly, but surely, declined as quarter succeeded quarter. Not since 1887, when 335 occurred, were so many deaths registered as in 1896, the previous greatest record during eleven years being in 1885, when 294 deaths were entered. The disease, therefore, assumed the dimensions of a very considerable epidemic in 1896. At the beginning of the year it was very prevalent, as it was to a much less degree in the third and fourth quarters of 1895, at which time there was no reason to fear that it would assume the proportions it ultimately reached—which, however, were at no time so great as those which prevailed in other districts bordering on the Parish. Thus, the death-rate in St. Pancras was 0.97 per 1,000. in St. Luke 2.60. and in Clerkenwell l.43. It will be interesting to note the movement of Measles in the districts encircling the Parish prior to its assuming epidemic dimensions. For this purpose it wiil be necessary to go back to the first quarter of 1895. At this period the disease was unusually, although not extraordinarily, prevalent in Shoreditch, where it caused a deathrate of 0.59 per 1 000. In the second quarter the disease assumed serious proportions, producing a death-rate of l.63, while at the same time, almost without warning, a heavy epidemic broke out in St. Luke, and at once became very fatal, being responsible for a death-rate of no less than 2.59 per 1,000. In this quarter, too, Measles was fatal in Hackney and Stoke Newington to an extent greater than could be desired. With the advent of the third quarter the disease became so deadly in St. Luke that the death-rate reached the extraordinary height of 6.8l per 1.000, and Clerkenwell, which had no deaths in the first quarter, now showed a death-rate of 1.20, while in Hackney the rate rose to 0.70. a rate which was exceeded by that of St. Pancras, 0.85 per 1,000. In this quarter, then, the disease was very prevalent to the west (St, Pancras and Clerkenwell), to the east (Hackney) and to the south (Shoreditch and St. Luke) of the Parish. 47 [1890 In the fourth quarters its severity had increased in St. Pancras, so that the death-rate rose to 2.70 per 1,000, while in Clerkenwell the unusual rate of 4.16 was recorded. In Hackney, too, the death-rate further rose to 0.78. The other districts, however, showed a decreased mortality. The advent of the first quarter of 1896, saw the disease still prevalent in St. Pancras (0.94), in Clerkenwell (1.75), in St. Luke (0.87), and in Shoreditch (1.64). ft was then that Measles assumed a fatal aspect in Islington, and the death-rate which in the three preceding quarters had been 0.49, 0.59 and 0.42 respectively, jumped to 2.00 per 1,000 inhabitants. With the beginning of May in the second quarter the disease in the Parish began to decline, so that the death-rate fell to 0 99, which was exactly the same rate as that of the Encircling Districts, but lower than the individual rates of Hackney, Clerkenwell, St. Luke and Shoreditch. In the September quarter the death-rate fell to 0.29, and in the last quarter of the year it was as low as 0.09 per 1,000 inhabitants. In the following Tables the course of the disease is shown for the two years in which it was prevalent in the districts around Islington. Table XXXI.

It appears to have been more fatal last year than in any year on record, with the single exception of the year 1864." Naturally, as the disease was so prevalent, particularly in districts surrounding the Parish, an effort was made to obtain early information of its presence. The method attempted, and how it was thwarted by the extraordinary action of the School Board for London, was described in the return of the Medical Officer for the first quarter of the year, and it is now reprinted:— Every possible means was adopted to stay its spread, hut as the disease is not a notifiable one, information was very generally only obtained as to its presence in a house when a death had occurred. In such instances it was usually found that other children living in the same house had been attending school during the period of the patient's illness. Indeed, in several cases they had been found in attendance even when he lay dead in the house. Under such circumstances it is very difficult for a Public Health Authority or its Medical Officer to prevent its spread. This difficulty was greatly enhanced by the conduct of the London School Board, who, in my opinion, adopted a line of conduct which is impossible to understand, and which cannot be defended, especially when it is recollected that everything that was done was equally in the interest of the schools and the public. Before writing further on this matter I should say that as there was no compulsory notification of the disease, I made arrangements with the several District Registrars to forward me immediate intelligence of the registration of every death from the disease; and by utilizing this information I was undoubtedly enabled to effect a considerable amount of good. I also issued, with the full approval of the Public Health Committee, the subjoined circular (p. 52) to the teachers of all schools, public and private, in the Parish; in addition to which I saw several of the head teachers of the Board Schools, and arranged with them to forward me information as to cases of Measles which came to their knowledge. I did this in order that it might not become necessary to close the schools if the epidemic should grow to large dimensions. 51 [1896 It was, therefore, with boundless astonishment that I was handed the following letter, addressed to the Vestry, to read:— SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. Victoria Embankment, 4th February, 1896. Sir The Board have had their attention drawn by the Head Master of their school in Gifford Street.. Islington, to a [circular letter which he has received from the Medical Officer of Health drawing attention to the prevalence of measles in the South-west SubRegistration District of Islington, and containing certain instructions for preventing the Bpread of the disease. I am directed by the Board to inform your Vestry that the Board have issued instructions to their teachers on the question of dealing with infectious illnesses, and expect their teachers not to take orders from any other body or person. I am further directed to state that the Board are of opinion that, if the Medical Officer of Health thinks that any variation of the Board's rule is expedient, he should get the Vestry to communicate with tho Board on the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) G. H. CROAD, Clerk to the Board. This letter was referred by the Vestry to the Public Health Committee for action, and at a meetingheld on February 10th, 1896,1 reported to them as follows: — To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Madam and Gentlemen, Letter from thb School Board fob London respecting Measlbs. The letter which you have just heard read appears to have originated in the following manner:— On the 16th of January I addressed a communication to all echools in the South-west District of your Parish, and among them to the Head Teacher of the Gifford Street Board School. The following is the letter : — Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., Dear Sir or Madam, January 16th, 1896. MEASLES. I have to inform you that Measles is at present very prevalent in the sub-registration district of Islington South-west, in which your School is situated. D 2 1896] 52 As this disease is likely to attack children attending the Infant School, it becomcs a matter of the utmost importance that they should be carefully examined, with the object of excluding suspected children. The disease usually begins with Catarrhal symptoms, running from the children's eyes and noses, appearing as if they had caught a cold. As it is immediately very infective, such children Bhould not bo re-admitted to their classes until they have produced a medical certificate as to their health. In the case of those children who aro known to be suffering from the disease, it is most advisable that they should not be allowed back to school for the period of one month after their convalescence, as the patient is likely to be in an infective condition for that period. It is also most necessary that all children living in the same house as the pationts should bo excluded from the school for a similar period. I have also to intimate that it is most advisable during tho hours in which the school rooms are unoccupied that tho doors and windows should be opened as widely as possible for the purpose of ventilation, but that on the other hand during the class hours the rooms Bhould bo kept warm and comfortable by means of open fires. I have to acquaint you that last week no less than six deaths were registered in the sub-district, making a total of 45 deaths since the commencement of the epidemic, from which you can judge for yourself tho absolute nocessity that exists for adopting these most reasonable precautions. I am, Yours faithfully, (Signed), ALFRED E. HARRIS, Mcdital Officer of Health. Accompanying this letter was the following leaflet which you authorised me to distribute:— PROTECTION AGAINST MEASLES. To Proprietors of Schools, School Managers and Teachers. As there is every reason to believe that Measles (which is at present epidemic in the Parish) iB spread to a considerable extent by means of Schools, the Public Health Committee are of opinion that it is imperatively necessary that Proprietors, School Managers and Teachers Bhould take every precaution against such disease being introduced into their schools, and with a view of assisting them in this direction I have been desired to make such recommendations* as might seem advisable for effecting that object, and beg to submit the following :— 1.—That at the present tiirto nil children suffering from a running at the eyes and nose, and showing symptoms of a cold, should be at once excluded from the School. These aro among the first symptoms of Measles, which disease is highly infectious, even in its earlier stages. *This word was printed in Italics in the circular. 53 [1896 2.—That it should be one of the requirements from parents of scholars that they should give notice to the Head Master or Mistress immediately on their becoming aware of the fact that Measles is in their houses. 3.—That on receipt of such notice the Master or Mistress should give information thereof to the Medical Officer of Health. 4.—That when any child is absent from School on the plea of illness, a letter from the parents or a certificate from a medical man should be required, stating the name of such illness. 5.—That a child who has suffered from Measles should not be allowed to re-enter the School without producing a certificate from a medical man, stating that he or she can do so without danger of infecting others. 6.— That children should not be allowed to attend School from a house in which Measles is known to exist, as, although not ill themselves, they are very likely to carry the infection to others, and to spread the disease. 7.—During the hours in which a School-room is not occupied the doors and windows should be opened as widely as possible, so that the room may be thoroughly ventilated. It is desirable that in all School-rooms there should be means for cross ventilation. 8.—During the winter months School-rooms should always be kept warm and comfortable by means of open fires or Btoves. It is a false notion to suppose that a number of children in a room is sufficient to keep it warm; no doubt the temperature will be raised, but this is done by the extraction of the heat from the bodies of the children, which cannot but be injurious to their health, whereas an open fire, whilst heating a room and keeping the children warm, also acts very efficiently as a means of ventilation. 9.—Cleanliness amongst tho scholars should be especially instisted upon, both as regards their clothes and persons. The greater the cleanliness of a School and of the scholars attending it, the less likelihood there will be of Measles spreading, should it by any chance be introduced therein. 10.—The School-room floors, desks, and forms should be thoroughly cleansed with soap and water, mixed with disinfectants, and the walls brushed down at least once a week ; and at the end of each week the rooms should bo disinfected with the fumes of burning sulphur. ALFRED E. HARRIS. Medical Officer of Health. Public Heath Department, Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., \bth January, 1896. The Head Teacher of Gifford Street Bond School, finding that in some respects these recommendations went farther than tho Board's secret instructions to their staff—I say "secret"—for up to the receipt of the Board's letter I was not aware of their existence, and so far as 1 can learn they had never been divulged to the Sanitary Authorities or their Medical Officers of Health. 1896] 54 Soon after sending my letter to the Teachers I called on the Head Teacher of the Gifford Street Board School, as I had become aware that deaths from Measles had occurred in Beaconsfiold Buildings, from which many children attended the School, and arranged with him, as suggested by the memorandum of the Local Government Board, that he should let me know of any cases of the disease which came to his knowlege. I have now to inform you, whether in consequence of the Board's letter to him or not it is not for me to say, that no case of Measles has been reported to me by him or, indeed, by any other Teacher. So far as I am concerned I have to say that I have only complied with the memorandum of the Local Government Board, dated July, 1894, which lays down that— "The attention of School Attendance Officers and of Schoolmasters should also he drawn to the following considerations. Frequently they themselves will obtain the earliest information of the occurrence of infectious diseases among scholars, and it is most desirable that such Offiecr or Master should without delay communicate the facts to the Medical Officer of Health. Absence of any child from school on the plea that it is suffering under one of the before-mentioned diseases, and absence of several children of one family from school at the same time, no matter what name be given to the complaint that keep6 them at home, should be reported to the Health Officer. In practice it has been found that this notification of absentees has materially aided the local Health Officer in taking measures for the suppression of infectious disease, to the advantage alike of the district and of the school. Furthermore, Schoolmasters may properly be asked to take note, especially when an epidemic threatens or is present of symptoms occurring in any of their scholars that may indicate the commencement of disease, febrile in nature. Besides heat of skin, such symptoms are shivering, headache, and languor, especially if commencing suddenly, vomiting, rashes on the skin, and sore throat. When Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria is about, every trace of sore throat should be looked upon as suspicious. In any case where such symptoms are observed, the safest course will be to exclude the child from School until assurance can be had that it may attend school without harm to itself or danger to other scholars." This is very explicit, and casts a very serious responsibility on the School Board if they should interfere with a Medical Officer of Health in the discharge of his duty. I cannot understand who could have so ill advised the School Board in this matter, but that they have been ill advised is very apparent. I have to point out that in the Local Government Board's Memorandum the School Board itself is never mentioned, but only the School Managers, attendance officers and teachers. In conclusion I desire to express my regret that the School Board for London should have taken action to prevent this authority obtaining information to which they are clearly entitled, and which was very essential for the prevention of an cpidemic such as that which recently prevailed in Clerkenwell and to a lesser extent in St. Pancras, and where so far as I can learn no action whatsoever had been taken by the Board. My experience of Measles has been very great, probably greater than any other Medical Officer of Health in England, and I have no hesitation in saying that the course 55 [1896 which you adopted on my advice was the one and only course to be pursued when a community is threatened with an epidemic. I am, Your obedient Servant, Vestry Hall, ALFRED E. HARRIS, Upper Street, N., Medical Officer of Health. 10th February, 1896. On the reading of these documents a discussion ensued when it was moved by Mr. Mote, seconded by Mr. Hollyman, and resolved that the School Board for London be informed that, having had the letter in question under consideration, and also a report from the Medical Officer of Health calling attention to Article 18 (6) of an Order of the Local Government Board dated March 23rd 1891, prescribing the relative duties of Medical Officers, of Health and Teachers in Elementary Schools, it would appear that, while the Medical Officer of Health has acted strictly within his powers, the School Board have exceeded theirs, in issuing to their teachers the instructions referred to in the seoond paragraph of their letter. It was also resolved that a copy of the correspondence be forwarded to the Local Government Board. The Vestry Clerk (Mr. W. F. Dewey) in accordance with this resolution addressed the following letters to the School Board for London and to the Local Government Board, to the latter of whom I had also forwarded a copy of my report. THE VESTRY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., 13th February, 1896. Sir, Referring to your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to a circular letter received by the Head Teacher of the Gifford Street Board School from the Medical Officer of Health of this Parish, I am directed to inform you that the letter has been submitted to the Vestry and referred by it to the Public Health Committee to be dealt with. The Public Health Committco now direct mo to inform the Board that they have had the letter in question under consideration and also a Report from the Medical Officer of Health calling attention to Article 18 (6) of an Order of the Local Government Board dated March 23rd, 1891, prescribing the relative duties of Medical Officers of Health and Teachers in Elementary Schools, from which it would appear that while the Medical 1896] 56 Officer of Health has acted strictly within his powers, your Board have exceeded theirs in issuing to their teachers the instructions* referred to in the second paragraph of your letter. I enclose a copy of a memorandum t recently published by tho Local Government Board, paragraph 7 of which deals with the Article in question. By direction of the Public Health Committee, I am forwarding a copy of this correspondence to the Local Government Board. I am, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) WM. F. DEWEY, Vestry Clirk. The Clerk. School Board for London, Victoria Embankment. THE VESTKY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. Vestry Hall, Upper Street, 13th February, 1896. To the Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S. W. Sir, I am directed by the Public Health Committee of this Vestry to forward for your information a copy of correspondence which has taken place between the School Board for London and themselves, relative to infectious disease in the neighbourhood of Board Schools. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signod) WM. F. DEWEY, Vestry Clerk. In reply to the latter letter the following communication was received: — Local Government Board, Whitbhall, S.W., 23rd Mareh, 1896. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to you letter of the 13th ultimo., forwarding copy of correspondence which has taken place between the School Board for London and the Islington Vestry relative to infectious disease in the neighbourhood of Board Schools. * i.e., Instructions not to take orders from any other body or person, which practically meant the rejection of advice tenderod by the Health Officer in accordance with the order of the Local Government Board. †Memorandum on the circumstances under which the closing of Public Elementary Schools may be required to prevent the spread of disease. July, 1894. 57 [1896 In reply, I am to inform tho Vestry that since tho circular which was issued with ths Medical Officer of Health's letter of the 16th January last to the Proprietors of Schools School Managers and Teachers and which appears to havo heen limited to the case of Measles, was only in the form of advice and recommendation, the Board consider that the Medical Officer of Health merely fulGlled his duty which devolves upon him under Article 18 (6) of the Board's General Order of 8th December, 1891. I am at the same time to state that in view of the instructions to which reference is made in the letter of the Clerk to the School Board of the 4th ultimo, and whioh, as the Board assume, relate to cases of notifiable disease as well as to those which are not notifiable, it may be well for the Vet try, in dealing with the subject of infectious diseases of the former olass, to consider whether, as regards cases in which they may in the future bo advised that the exclusion of particular children is desirable, they should not rely upon the exercise of their powers under Article 88 of the Education Code. I am, however, to add that in any case where tho Medical Officer of Health finds it expedient to tako such uction as in the present instance, the Board consider that it is very desirable that he should communicate with the Medical Officer of Health of tho School Board on the subject, with a view to secure as far as possible his co-operation in the matter. I am, Sir, Your obediont Servant, (Signed) C. N. DALTON, Assistant Secretary. There can bo no doubt that the latter clause of this letter will be read with amazement by Medical Officers of Health, for if its suggestion be carried into effect, then it will at once cripple their hands in dealing promptly with infectious diseases, which, although they are non-notifiable, yet are frequently much more fatal than those which are. If this clause means anything, it means that London Medical Officers of Health cannot proceed to perform their duties—the duties laid down most definitely in the Board's own Order—quickly and expeditiously without first consulting the irresponsible Medical Officer of the London School Board. The health interests of this great metropolis must wait until such period as ho amidst his many duties, can spare time to attend to those other duties for which he was never appointed. In matters of this kind delays are dangerous, and that delays will occur is certain, for already his time is so fully employed, that when this question of Measles was a burning one in this district it was not enquired into by himself, but by his assistant. No one doubts his ability, that is beyond dispute, but he cannot do everything, more especially when the fact is taken into consideration that he already holds at least five different public appointments. 1896] 58 If this letter of the Local Government Board means the initiation of a changed order of things then it becomes a matter of necessity that the duties and responsibilities of the Medical Officers to School Boards should be clearly defined by the Local Government Board, and that legislation should be introduced giving them that locus standi in health matters which they do not at present possess. The new state of affairs can only lead to friction, and, therefore, should be regulated by some order defining the lelative duties of the several officers. As a commentary on the action of the School Board, who were so anxious that advice should not be given to their officers, it may be pointed out that although the Board's private code of regulations for the guidance of managers, correspondents and teachers contains the subjoined very strong clause as to affording information to the Medical Officer of Health, yet not once did information reach me from them, although the teachers up to the time of the letter from the Board had from time to time afforded me valuable information, for which I expressed my appreciation in my Report for the Third Quarter of last year (vide p. 13). (ii.) “Any child showing symptoms of an infectious disease, or any child coming from a house where an infectious disease exists, must be sent home at once, and the Superintendent of Visitors must be immediately informed of the case, in order that enquiries may at once be made with a view to proper steps being taken to prevent the children living in the same house or tenement from attending school. The Medical Officer of Health for the district must also at the tame time be informed of the child's exclusion, and furnished with the name and address of the child and the reason of its exclusion on a form with which the teachers will be supplied by the Head Office” (p. 67). The italics are those of the Medical Officer of Health. Now if it be recollected that there were 170 deaths from Measles during the quarter, and if the fatality were 5 per cent., and it is not supposed it was higher, then there must have been at least 3,400 cases. Is it possible that no knowledge of any of these cases came to the Board School Officials? The query cannot be answered by your Medical Officer. All he knows is that no information ever reached him, a fact much to be regretted, for it would have been invaluable in assisting to stay the Measles. (24 Years 1872-95.) The Mean Line represents an average weekly number of 3 deaths. The, dotted, line represents the Deaths fromMeasles in London, during a period of 50years, (1841-90). Tke Mean. London Line- representing arvaxrerage- weekly number of 34- deaths. 59 [1896 epidemic, which was weekly carrying off so many young lives ; hut still it is an extraordinary circumstance that no knowledge of cases seems to have come to the school attendance officers and the teachers ! It is earnestly hoped that on another orcasion similar ignoranoe of cases will not prevail. The action of the Local Government Hoard in tying the hands of the London Medical Officers (and by a parity of reasoning every Medical Officer of Health in England, where the School Board may think it advisable to appoint a Medical Officer) is inexplicable, and has, as was anticipated, caused utter astonishment among them. It is therefore to be hoped that the Medical Department of the Local Government Board, to whom the health of the community is of such interest, will speedily annul the objectionable paragraph in the letter addressed to this Vestry on March 23rd, 1896. In consequence of this epidemic the attention of the Medical Officer of Health has been directed in a special manner towards the seasonal prevalence of measles, and he remarked at page 21 of his return for the second quarter of the year, that when its behaviour in London was represented diagramatically by curves it was remarkable in showing a double mciximum and minimum curve, the larger maximum occurring in November, December and January, the cold season of the year, and the smaller in May and June. He also remarked that the larger minimum occurred in August, September and October, and the smaller towards the end of January, February and March. In Islington so far as he could see without having actually charted the deaths, it seemed that the greater maximum occurred in March, April and May, and the lesser in December, January and February. He was only partly correct in this statement, for he finds, vide chart on opposite page, that the Islington curves follow the London curves very closely, but the periods of the year at which the greater and fesser maximum occurs are reversed, and so it is also with the greater and lesser minimum curves. Another noteworthy circumstance is that the intensity of the curve is much greater iu Islington than in London, for whereas the maximum curves rise to 77 and 36 per cent. in Islington, they only reach 25 and 51 per cent. in London, and whereas the minimum curves fall to 30 and 45 per cent. 1896] 60 in the Metropolis, they go down as low as 40 and 79 per cent. hereIn London the disease behaves from year's end to year's end in a more even manner, whereas here it runs to extremes. Indeed, the sharp fall in Islington from the greater maximum to the greater minimum is what the Americans would probably call a “landslide.” It is at any rate a very accentuated curve. It is difficult to understand how it happens that the Islington greater maximum occurs at a warm period of the year, for as shown in the report for the second quarter of this year (page 17), pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases are the secondary causes which chiefly carry off persons suffering from measles, and it is of course at the cold period of the year that such diseases are most prevalent, and when consequently their effect would be most felt by patients suffering from a disease, which, by its very nature, renders its victims particularly prone to contract them. (Vide Report Third Quarter, Table VIII). Of course it may happen that the number of cases occurring at the colder period may be comparatively few, and that the mortality is relatively larger, notwithstanding the fact that the total number of deaths is not so great. Indeed this is the only explanation that is possible in the absence of information as to the number of cases that occurred, for it would be quite reasonable to think that although there might be an extraordinary large number of cases at the time when the greater maximum is reached, yet the case mortality (fatality), might be small, although sufficiently large to exceed the number of deaths which take place in the winter, when the cases are fewer, but the fatality greater. The matter is one of considerable interest, as bearing upon seasonable influence on diseases, but it is not proposed to discuss it further here. SCARLET FEVER. This disease was credited with 57 deaths, which were equal to a death-rate of 0.16 per 1,000. This return is slightly below the return 61 [1896 for the preceding eleven years, after correction bas been made for increased population, viz., 60. In each of the preceding eleven years the figures were:— 1885 36 deaths. 1891 50 deaths 1886 26 „ 1892 53 „ 1887 59 „ 1893 94 „ 1888 64 „ 1894 69 1889 40 „ 1895 66 „ 1890 65 „ 1896 57 „ Table XXXV.

The returns for the previous eleven years were:— 1885 167 1891 158 1886 72 1892 150 1887 46 1893 180 1888 50 1894 208 1889 62 1895 137 1890 81 1896 247 The mean annual number of deaths, after correct ion for increase of population, in the eleven years was 126. The death-rate resulting from the 247 deaths was equal to 0.71 per 1,000 inhabitants. In other populous places the death-rates during the year from Diphtheria were as follows:— England and Wales 0.27 per 1,000 inhabitants. 33 Great Towns 0.35 ,, 67 other Large Towns 0.24 ,, England and Wales, less the 100 Towns 0.23 „ London 0.57 ,, Encircling Districts 0.47 „ Hampstead 0.39 „ St. Pancras 0.40 ,, Stoke Newington 0.56 „ Hackney 0.47,, Clerkenwell 0.62 „ St. Luke 0.62 „ Shoreditch 0.60 „ Islington 0.71 „ 63 [1896 The death-rate was higher in this Parish than in any of the abovementioned places. There were, however, several London districts wherein the death-rate was higher, namely:— Chelsea 1.17 per 1,000 inhabitants. Limehouse 0.83 „ Mile End 0.86 „ St. Saviour 0.70 „ St. Olave 0.76 ,, Bermondsey 0.84 „ Camberwell 1.01 „ Greenwich 0.78 „ Lewisham 0.88 ,, Woolwich 0.74 „ Plumstead 0.91 „ Among the Provincial Towns, West Ham (really a metropolitan district) and Wolverhampton alone showed death-rates nearly approaching these, and there the death-rates were in each case 0.60. It is a noteworthy fact that whereas in the 33 large towns (inclusive of London) the death-rate from Diphtheria rose from 0.27 in ten years to 0.38 or Oil per 1,000, yet in London it increased from 0.41 to 0.60 per 1,000, or 0.19. Why this is so, is really the great health problem of the day in London. This subject has in previous reports been dwelt on at length, and it is not proposed to go into it now, more especially as it will in all probability be the subject of a special report. Table XXXVII.

The greatest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year, when 13 persons died; in the second 5, in the third 6, and in the fourth quarter 9. ERYSIPELAS. Fourteen persons died from Erysipelas, as against 16 in the preceding quarter and 15 in 1894. The death-rate was 0.04 per 1,000 inhabitants. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. In this class 1,122 deaths occurred. Of these the greater number arose from the following diseases:- 1895. 1896. Increase or Decrease. — — Rheumatic Fever 9 17 + 8 Rheumatism 12 12 • • • ...

Of these diseases Phthisis and Cancer call for attention. PHTHISIS. Phthisis was the cause of 530 deaths, which were equal to a death rate of 1.69 per 1,000. The deaths occurred as follows :— Upper Holloway 123 deaths = 1.22 per 1000 inhabitants. South-west Islington 204 „ = 1.86 ,, South-east „ 125 „ = 1.84 ,, Highbury 78 „ = 1.18 ,, 530 = 1.54 The return is satisfactory, for it is 43 below the mean annual number of deaths recorded in the preceding five years.

The number of infectious diseases notified during the year was 3,882, which represent a sickness rate of 11.15 per 1,000 inhabitants, as 74 1896] against an annual rate of 10.2, which prevailed in the quinquennial period, 1891-95.

Fifty notifications of Small Pox were made during the year of which 49 proved to be genuine cases. With the exception of April, October, November and December, cases occurred in every month. In the First Quarter, 12 cases were notified, of which 7 occurred in Upper Holloway, 1 in South-west Islington, and 4 in Highbury. No case was known in South-east Islington. One of the patients was an infant who was born in the Highgate Hospital for Small Pox, whither the mother of the child had been removed from another district for treatment. In the Second Quarter, towards the end of May, two cases of Small Pox were notified. These were followed by 16 others during June, making a total of 18 cases. They were practically confined to the Upper Holloway Sub-district, for, with one exception, all the cases occurred there. The first case was that of a lad 15 years old, a hawker of bootlaces, living at a common lodging house, 11, Queensland Road. The source of 75 [1896 the disease could not be traced. He had only been a lodger in this house a few days when attacked, from which it is clear that the infection was not contracted in it. He had previously lived with relatives in a house at t he opposite side of the street, but they were free from infection. Twenty cases were notified in the Third Quarter, of which 20 cases 10 were notified in July, 4 in August, and 6 in September (5 weeks) The disease was chiefly confined to Upper Holloway, where 12 cases were reported; 2 occurred in Islington South-west, and 6 in Highbury. From South-east Islington no case was notified. Towards the end of June it became necessary to advise the Public Health Committee that it would be well to employ additional medical assistance so as to make a house-to-house inspection in the streets in which Small Pox had appeared, particularly in Campbell Road, in order to ascertain if any cases remained undiscovered, and also to vaccinate, if permission were given, all persons who had been exposed to infection. The Committee at once gave their assent, and it was fortunate enough to secure the services of Dr. Leslie Thorne (son of Sir Richard Thorne, Medical Officer of the Local Government), who at once commenced his duties, and for four weeks diligently kept watch and ward over those houses and streets in which Small Pox had appeared. This action of the Public Health Committee was most prudent, and was the means of bringing to an end what might have proved a much more serious outbreak. In this connection it must not be omitted to mention the very ready services afforded by Inspector Sweeney (formerly a Sanitary Inspector of the Islington Vestry, but now Inspector of Common Lodging Houses for the London County Council), as well as by Inspectors Jordan and Grivell, of the Vestry's staff, who spared neither time nor pains in doing what they could to assist in checking the outbreak. It must also be mentioned that to Inspector Ward is due the great credit in tracing the cases of Small Pox at Hornsey Rise, which, but for his timely discovery, might have spread the disease broadcast in the district. 1896] 76 It happened that cases numbered 262, 263 and 264 were discovered in the following manner, for they were never notified. On July 8th, your Medical Officer received through Dr. Shirley Murphy, Medical Officer of the London County Council, a letter from Dr. Scatterty, Medical Officer of Health of Keighly (Yorks), in which he stated that two cases very like Small Pox had come under his notice, and that they stated that they had been staying at the "Favorite," P.H., Hornsey Rise. Not knowing of any cases in that neighbourhood, the Medical Officer made a strict investigation, without eliciting any information. Fortunately, it came to Inspector Ward's recollection, that some time previously he had seen a man standing at a door in Hornsey Rise, with a very sore face, from which matter was oozing. He was at once sought out (case 263), and was found at work, although alone, and it was noticed that his face showed unmistakable signs of confluent Small Pox. He had then completely recovered. It was further discovered that his wife bad had two or three spots on her face, and enquiries revealed the following history. On May 10th, she felt very unwell, with severe pains in her back, and next day she had a miscarriage. A few days later, two or three spots appeared on her face, and these were ascribed by her medical attendant "to the feverish condition of her blood, consequent on her miscarriage." Nothing more was thought of the matter. Fourteen days later, however, her husband was attacked with what must have been confluent Small Pox, if one might judge from the description given to your medical officer by his wife as well, as from the pitted condition of his face when he saw him on July 8th. He had been treated for Chicken Pox, and his wife was informed by his medital advisers that this was the disease from which he suffered. During the period of his convalescence he was seen by many persons in the road with matter running from sores on his face, and he 77 [1896 stated that he walked out “because his medical advisers told him that he would not get well until he got out.” Just as he was getting well case 264 took ill (June 22nd), and on the date of your medical officer's visit (July 8th) the pustules on his face had nearly dried up, and he was nearly convalescent. This case had also been diagnosed as Chicken Pox. It is much to be wondered at that more cases were not propagated by these persons, for in the first place case 262 kept a newspaper and tobacco shop, and was, therefore, in close touch with the public at the time she was nursing her husband. There can be very little doubt, but that it was at her shop the cases reported from Keighly contracted Small Pox, for "The Favorite" P.H. is only a few doors away, and it is, therefore, more than likely that these people visited it. I have been unable to trace any other cases to this source of infection, although one cannot help wondering if case 239 contracted the infection here, as the shop was partitioned so as to make two shops, one of which was a bootmaker's, at which case 264 worked. At first your medical officer felt inclined to blame the doctors in attendance on these people for failing to diagnose the disease, but when he recollected that very few medical men when students ever see, or have the opportunity of seeing, cases of Small Pox, he was obliged to look on their error in a more lenient light. This blot on medical training should be removed by the Medical Council making some rule by which students should be compelled to produce certificates, showing that they had seen a certain number of cases of this disease, before being allowed to proceed for their examinations. In the Fourth Quarter no case of Small Pox was reported, which was without doubt due to the energetic manner in which it had been combatted in the previous three months. 78 1896] The following Table shows the sex, age, state as to vaccination and the address of the several persons who were notified as suffering from the disease.

Last year it was possible to note a “most gratifying decrease in the number of cases of Diphtheria notified during 1895, whether compared with the preceding year, or with any year since notification of the infectious diseases became compulsory.” It is much to be regretted that the gratification then experienced does not extend to 1896, for as if to compensate for the small number of cases in 1895, an unusually large number were notified during the year with which this report deals. In 1893, 854 cases were notified; in 1894, 843; in 1895, 564; and in 1896, 1,067. It almost seems as if a law of averages meant that the two last years should show a mean number (815) of cases that would about equal the record of the previous years. In every part of the Parish the disease was more prevalent than in the preceding year. Cases. Case-rate. 1895. 1896. 1895. 1896.

The increase is chiefly due to the fact that the climatic conditions of the third quarter of the year* were peculiarly favourable to the propagation of the disease, and therefore, it is not to be wondered at that it was more than usually prevalent.

No case was known in the Parish during the twelve months. This disease is happily becoming more rare in London and in the provincial towns, owing entirely to the improved sanitary conditions under which the people live. * 91 [1896 ERYSIPELAS. There were 385 rases of Erysipelas reported during the twelvemonths, as against 320 in the preceding year, and an average of 456 in the five years 1891-95. The disease was proportionately most prevalent in Upper Holloway, where the case or sickness-rate was 1.38 per 1,000 inhabitants. It is a remarkable fact that the fatality (4.1 per 100 cases) was higher than that of Small Pox or Scarlet Fever. Table LXVI.

Out of 3,846 cases of Infectious Disease notified to the Medical Officer of Health, 1,862 were treated in hospitals, and 1,984 in their own homes. Of the hospital cases 10.6 per cent. died, and of those treated at home 9.7 per cent., the total fatality being 10.1 per cent. Full particulars of the fatility from the various diseases are given in the two following Tables. Generally speaking, the results seem to be in favour of home treat ment, but this is only because, as already noticed in previous reports the milder cases are not sent to hospitals, and consequently, these have to treat only the most severe cases.

The work of disinfecting articles which had been exposed to the influence of the several infectious diseases was effected in a most thorough and satisfactory manner in the steam disinfectors erected by Messrs. Goddard, Massey, and Warner. The two machines have been worked alternately, one or the other having been used every day of the year, Sundays and holidays alone excepted. The machines have given no trouble and there has been no break down, so that the engineer is now able to report that they are in a most efficient condition. The work performed by the machines has increased very considerably since they were first erected, as the following statement will show:— Articles disinfected. 1895—Six months ending December 17,240 1896 „ „ June 18,971 1896 „ „ December 24.296 Total 60,507 Among the larger articles disinfected there were:— 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4 th Quarter.

In past years when complaint had been made by the Vestry respecting "return cases" of Scarlet Fever, the Metropolitan Asylums Board met the charge by saying that it was not that the patients had been discharged too early but that the work of disinfection had been improperly carried out. In the face of the above record of work done by two of the most modern appliances, it will be no longer possible for such an excuse to be made by a body who have always been quite ready to shift the burden of their neglect on to other shoulders. At present there is hardly any place, certainly not in London, in which all the work appertaining to disinfection is so thoroughly carried out as in Islington. In addition to the work of the Parish, the machines also disinfected all the articles that had been exposed to infection in Stoke Newington. The report of the Medical Officer of London for 1895, shows that twenty-four sanitary authorities have provided themselves with disinfecting apparatus, in which disinfection is effected by steam, and that six authorities possess apparatus in which disinfection is effected by dry heat, while eight authorities arrange with a contractor. Destruction of Infected Articles.—The crematory connected with the disinfecting station has been frequently used to destroy infected articles, such as bedding, which were in too foul or too dilapidated a condition to be returned to their owners. The crematory was also found to be very useful in destroying the unsound food which had been seized by the Inspectors. It performed these duties perfectly, reducing the contents to ash in a very brief time. Through an oversight, a record of the articles destroyed in it was not kept. This oversight has now been corrected and in future reports a return will be given. It may, however, be said that, owing to the more efficient means employed to disinfect bedding, &c., many articles that previously would have been destroyed were now saved and returned to their owners, and 144 1896] consequently the Vestry was saved the cost of replacing them Comparatively few London sanitary authorities seem to have made special provision for destruction, most of them destroying infected articles either in their dust destructors, or in furnaces to which they have access. A few authorities continue to destroy them on open ground and in the open air. From these remarks it will be perceived that Islington occupies a leading position in the matter of dealing with infected articles. The cost to the Vestry for disinfecting for the year was under £400. Table LXXXVIII. Showing the Fumigation of Rooms after Infectious Disease. Year ending 2nd January, 1897.

INFANTILE MORTALITY. There was 1,460 deaths of children under twelve months old These were equal to an infantile mortality rate of 150 per 1,000 children born in the year. This rate is slightly above the rate which prevailed during the thirteen years 1883-95, when it was 145 per 1,000.

In the two succeeding Tables the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is fully set out. They speak for themselves, and fully prove that these officials have been doing most useful work. Altogether, 7,645 houses, not including factories and workshops, were inspected, to which 56,810 visits were paid. In addition to the work of the Inspectors, and apart altogether from his ordinary visits, the Superintendent and Chief Inspector (Mr. J. R. Leggett) visited every house for which application was made for a statutory notice, and reported thereon to the Public Health Committee. 147 [1896 Table XC.

It was worthy of high praise. He also notices with great satisfaction that they were most punctual every morning in their attendance at the Vestry Hall at nine o'clock. Indeed, the occasions on which members of the staff were late were so few that they could be counted by units. This speaks well for the interest which they have undoubtedly taken in their work. k 2 148 1896] Table XCI.

The work of the two Inspectors (male and female) was of the most satisfactory character, and fully—indeed, more than—justified the action of the Vestry in appointing them especially for this purpose. They have accomplished a very large amount of work, which has resulted in improved conditions under which work-people labour. Many of the premises inspected had never been visited by any of H.M. Inspectors, and as a result no fewer than 172 such workshops were reported to the Home Office by Miss Gray alone. Work of the Female Inspector (Miss Gray).—This Inspector made 1,251 inspections of workshops, containing 1,900 workrooms, during the year. In 27 overcrowding occurred, in 10 the ventilation was bad, and in 50 there was uncleanliness. In addition to these 341 other sanitary defects were rectified. 547 workroom cards, slating the number of workers which the rooms would accommodate when working ordinary time, as well as overtime, were distributed. In this connection it was a Matter of much regret that one of H M. Assistant-Inspectors stated to an employer of labour that "they were not worth the paper they were printed on," thereby, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, greatly exceeding his duty and interfering in a most unwarrantable manner with toe duties and responsibilities attaching to the Vestry's officers. It is not expected that a similar incident will occur again, as a speedy remonstrance was addressed to the offender by your Medical Officer of Health. Now these cards are of real service, for they enable workers to at once perceive if unscrupulous employers are overcrowding their work places. That they do so is quite apparent, for Miss Gray came across 27 instances in which this offence was committed, and in her report on her work for the second quarter of the year she pointed out that in one workroom "where there was space for two persons only, there were six at work; and in another with space for four there were eight persons employed. "It is to prevent such occurrences that these most valuable cards have been distributed. 151 [1896 A careful perusal of Miss Gray's report, and especially of the Table appended to it, will give a better insight into her work than any remarks that can be made upon it. It is full of interest to those who desire to keep themselves acquainted with the labour question as it exists in this Parish. To Dr. A. E. Harris, Medical Officer of Health. The Vestry Hall, Islington, 30th January, 1897. Sir, I have pleasure in laying bofore you a report of my work during 1896. Register.—At the end of the year there are on the register 660 workshops and workplaces in which women are employed and 150 "workshop" laundries—i.e., laundries in which more than two persons are employed and in which no mechanical power is used. Thirty-five different trades are carried on in the various workrooms. In the majority articles of wearing apparel are manufactured, as shown in the following Table :— Nature of Business. Number of Workshops. Dress-making 204 Tie-making 74 Millinery 62 Mantle-making 62 Blouse-making 47 Fur-sewing 45 Tailoring 28 Artificial Flower-making 28 Underclothing making 26 Beadwork 20 Leather and Fancy Goods making 15 Boot and Shoe making 8 Box-making 8 Miscellaneous 33 Two hundred and fifty-five workshops have been added to the register during the year. Inspections.—I hare inspected 1,251 workshops, containing 1,990 workrooms, and I hare made 1,061 calls and re-inspections. In addition to the workshops and laundries on the register, I have visited numerous small laundries in which only one or two persons are employed, and also the homes of some of the female out-workers employed in the Parish. Cleanliness.—I found 50 workrooms in a dirty condition ; these have been cleansed and whitewashed. Ventilation.—In nine workrooms, which were insufficiently ventilated, additional ventilators have been provided. In my experience, it is only in those workrooms in which [1896 152 the employers understand the importance of fresh air that sufficient attention is paid to ventilation. The employees, as a rule, do not see the necessity for it, and, if left to themselves, keep the windows and ventilators closed. Of course, it is only natural that they, often inadequately clad, should object to Bitting ten and a half hours a day in a draught. Much, however, can he done by airing the rooms thoroughly at mealtimes. The practice of heating workrooms by means of gas burners only is much to be deprecated, as generally in those cases gas is only allowed for two hours or so in the morning; consequently the employees are afraid to open the windows, and by the end of the day the state of the atmosphere may be imagined. Overcrowding.—In twenty-seven workrooms overcrowding has been abated; in most cases additional accommodation has been provided for the extra hands. I have distributed 647 workroom cards, stating the number to be employed in each room. Sanitary Defects.—I have reported, during the year, 541 nuisances liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act. I have issued 107 intimation notices and supervised the abatement of 133 nuisances. Laundries.—On my first inspection of the laundries, I found their condition far from satisfactory. Owing partly to the nature of the business, most of them were in a more or less dirty and dilapidated state. In the ironing-rooms, the walls, ceilings and floors were defective, so much so that in three cases, at least, I found that workers had fallen through the floors! Many of the wash-houses were paved with wood and were, in consequence, in a most insanitary condition. The sanitary arrangements were, as a rule, far from perfect These defects have been remedied and there is now a marked improvement in all sanitary matters. Several new, well-ventilated wash-houses and ironing-rooms have been built during the year, and the plan of having the iron-heating stove in a separate room from the workers (though not required by the provisions of the Factory Act in "workshop" laundries) has been adopted in many places. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JESSY M. S. GRAY, Inspector of Workrooms. 153 1896] Summary of Factory and Workshop Work from the Female Inspector's Reports, from 30 th December, 1895, to 2nd January, 1897. DESCRIPTION OF WORK.

West).—Inspector West, like his colleague Miss Gray, has had a very busy year, and has done a good deal of good work, varied in character, and beneficial to the health of the workpeople of the districts. His duties comprise the inspection of workshops, bakehouses, laundries, and all places in which men work, as well as of smoky chimneys. Bakehouses.—He made during the year 1,006 visits to bakehouses and on 235 occasions had to call attention to dirty conditions, the bulk of which, however, were not of serious moment. Indeed, it may be said with very great truth that at the present moment the bakehouses of the Parish will bear a favourable comparison with those situated in other districts. In only six instances was it found necessary to serve notices on the occupiers, as the bakers readily complied with the Inspector's requirements. The drains in 15 instances were re-constructed, repaired or improved. In 5 instances new w.c.'s were provided, and in 7 water supplies were fitted. Additional ventilation was provided to 5 bakehouses, and 253 were cleansed and whitewashed, 14 had their yards, floors, and roofs repaired, and additional w.c. accommodation was procured for 2. As the summary of the Inspector's report on the accompanying Table gives very full particulars it will not be necessary to go through in detail the several workshops which have been visited, but it may be stated that they include— Tailors' Shops Bootmakers. Piano Manufacturers Brassworkers Rag Sorters Glass Works Bicycle Works Balloon Works Screw Stopper Works Builders' Shops Cabinet Makers Shops Summary of Factory and Workshop Work from the Male Inspector's Reports.

At the end of 1895 there were 384 houses on the register, to which 74 were added during 1896, making a total of 458 now registered. Inspector Jordan, whose labours have been greatly appreciated by the Medical Officer of Health, has had charge of these premises, and during the year has performed very good and most encouraging work— encouraging because it has greatly improved the conditions under which the occupiers live, and also because it will, without doubt, induce the Vestry to be more willing to place tenemented houses, occupied by a careless class of the population, on the register. There are some residences, e.g., Elliott's Place, which, owing to the dirty habits of the tenants, it is almost impossible to keep in a cleanly state; hut even here matters are not nearly so bad as they were formerly. During the twelve months the Inspector made 4,592 inspections, 1,593 calls, and had 1,309 improvements effected. His visits have been for the most part gladly received by the tenants, who as a rule, have assisted him in his efforts, especially when they came to understand that his object was to improve their surroundings. Among the chief improvements effected were those relating to the provision of extra water closet accommodation when the premises were occupied by more than twelve persons, to choked drains, and to overcrowding. Many premises were also limewashed and cleansed. In the current years the by-law respecting the cleansing of the premises will be tightened, and the owners will be required to carry out its most salutary obligations. It is confidently believed that this will make an enormous improvement in these houses, which, for want of a special Inspector, have hitherto been sadly neglected. There is nothing which causes the befouling of the atmosphere of occupied dwellings so much as dirty passages, stairs, ceilings and walls, nor anything that tends to promote its purity as limewashing ceilings and walls and washing paint work with soap and water. 18961 156 A special notice has been sent to the owner of each premises calling on him to comply with the by-law, and notifying him that his neglect will entail a penalty. The following are the by-laws in question :— 17. The landlord of a lodging-house shall, in the first week of the month of April in every year, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed. He shall, at the same time, except in such cases as are hereinafter specified, cause every area, the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every water-closet belonging to the promises, and the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every room, staircase and passage in the house to be thoroughly lime-washed. Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to the lime-washing of the internal surface of the walls of rooms, staircases, and passages shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such wall is painted, or where the material of or with which such surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-whiting thereof unsuitable or inexpedient and where such surface is thoroughly cleansed and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. PENALTY. 21. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing by-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this by-law. The following is a brief summary of the work performed by Inspector Jordan:— Inspections Calls. Total Visits.

PAUPERISM. In each of the Quarterly Returns a table was given showing the state of pauperism in the Parish during each week of the several periods. The following table gives a synopsis of these returns :— Table XC1I. Showing the State of Pauperism in the Parish during the year 1896. Quarters. Indoor Paupers, Adults and Children.

THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD. During the year 825 samples of drugs and food, including 70 samples of margarine, were procured for analysis. 126 of these, or 15.3 per cent., were returned by the Public Analyst (Dr. F. L. Teed) as being adulterated. In the following statement will be seen the result of the analysis for each quarter:— No. of Samples. Genuine. Adulterated. Per cent. 1896. adulterated. 1895. 1st Quarter 213 166 31 14.5 19.9 2nd „ 211 194 17 8.0 8.0 3rd „ 204 169 35 17.1 17.1 4th „ 197 145 43 21.8 21.8 Totals 825 674 126 15.3 15.7 In the preceding five years the number of samples procured for analysis with the results were as follows:— Year.

Compared with many other places the amount of adulteration practised in Islington is small. 159 [1896 Milk.—Out of 468 samples of Milk 50, or 10-6 per cent., were adulterated. Of these 463 samples 264 were procured on week-days and 21, or 7-9 per cent, were adulterated. The remaining 174 samples were bought on Sundays, and of these 29, or 16.6 per cent, were adulterated. Adulteration of milk sold on Sundays was practised to more than twice the extent to that which prevailed during the remainder of the week. 1896. No. of Samples Taken. No. of Samples Adulterated.

Butter.—149 samples were procured, of which 20 or 13.4 per cent. were margarine. Sugars.—14 samples of Demerara sugars were bought for analysis, and of these 12 proved to be "best crystals" or "imitation" cane sugars. The cases were fought most determinedly, indeed, some of the defendants, no doubt having the support of the beet sugar manufacturers in this country, brought forward as witnesses the well-known sugar refiners, Messrs. Tate and Lyle, whose names are household words in the sugar world. When these samples were ordered to be taken, no one had any conception that the sale of beet sugar for cane sugar had assumed anything like the proportion that the analysis revealed. [1896 160 In the report of the Food Products Committee of the House of Commons, they say that it is "a fraud" to sell beet sugar for Demerara, and it was on account of this strong expression of opinion that these samples were procured. Since these prosecutions took place, very many have occurred throughout the country, the magistrates universally holding that the purchaser must be given the article for which he asked, and not that which the grocer thought would suit him better. Prescriptions—Eight prescriptions were submitted to Pharmaceutical Chemists to be compounded secundum artem, and it is very unsatisfactory to report that in 5 instances they were incorrectly made up.
