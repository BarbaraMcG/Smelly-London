To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the work of the Public Health Department during 1944 in the continued absence of Dr. C.O.S. Blyth Brooke on military service. The restrictions previously imposed, on the grounds of national security, have now been removed and it is possible to give figures previously witheld. The population figures given in tabular form in the vital statistics section make interesting reading. It is noteworthy that the increase in the number of deaths is accounted for by 70 due to violence. As this report has been completed after the end of the war in 1945 it is possible to say that fuller comment on these matters is to be embodied in the next Annual Report. Much that has been hitherto obscure in the war time reports will appear in a new light, for example the small reduction in the number of tuberculosis patients compared with a reduction by half of the population, which suggests that the tuberculous person was unable to afford evacuation or was in some other way restricted in his or her efforts to leave London. This question was the subject of a paper in the British Medical Journal by Sir Allen Daley and Mr. Franklin of the London County Council some time ago. It is worthy of note that the Tuberculosis Allowances Scheme which received a warm welcome everywhere, in spite of its limitations, has continued to operate satisfactorily. A considerable onus has been put upon the Tuberculosis Officer. The experience so fur gained augurs well for more comprehansive schemes covering wider fields. This experience may be summed up in one word, "Reasonableness". This has been shown, in our experience, by the Assessment Officer, the Dispensary and Care Committee Staffs, the London County Council, the Ministry of Health and not least by the patients and their relatives. The Care Committee continues to fill, most ably, the gap which legislation has not yet closed. During the year co-operation with the London County Council continued in relation to publicity in the campaign against Venereal Diseases, the Borough arranging for the display of suitable posters. The number of illegitimate births was 47 among the 427 births which occurred during the year, as compared with 24 out of 466 in 1943. The increase in the illegitimate births has been of concorn during the war and the Council agreed to participate fully in the proposals put forward for the Metropolitan area. These are outlined later in the report but the position is still unsatisfactory in that the supply of foster mothers is poor and evasion of the law common. The Ministry of Health suggestions regarding the care of premature infants were also implemented in the course of the year, as sot out in the appropriate section of tho report. 4. A further fall in the infant mortality figures is gratifying; it now approximates to that of tho figure for England and Wales. Having regard to local conditions, our expectations have been exceeded but there is still room for improvement. In the main there was a fall in the number of notifications of infectious disease, whooping cough being the exception. Diphtheria caused no deaths, giving encouragement to those engaged in the immunisation campaign which has been continued during the year. Wartime nurseries continued to operate during the year, although Claremont Nursery was closed during the year, mainly because of the small attendance due to the flying bomb activity. It was found necessary â€¢ to open the new nursery at Donegal Street with accommodation for 65 - 71 children. Staffing difficulties were as acute as ever during 1944, and were only overcome by tho enthusiasm shown by the staff themselves. A slight drop in the total attendance figures at the Health Centre Clinics was due to the flying bomb attacks which caused a considerable number of cancelled appointments, particularly in elderly and cripple people, but the clinics continued to be popular, the dental and foot clinics showing en increase over 1943. The number of verminous cases rose from 158 in 1943 to 293 in 1944. Almost all the cases were of head infestation and the majority occurred in adolescent girls in industry. A close liason is maintained with factory doctors and a system of home follow-up sometimes reveals a source of infection in the home. This method of treating the family as a unit is found to give-results of greater permanance than treating individual cases as they occur. Housing became a greater problem as a result of destruction by flying bombs. Comment is made on this question in the Housing Section of the report. It is my intention to review the position in a comprehensive manner when the final war-damage data are available. Finally I wish to thank the members of the Public Health and maternity and Child Welfare Committees for their kind assistance and helpful suggestions during the year and to thank the loyal members of my staff who overcame the problems of this most difficult year of the war. I have the honour to be Your obedient servant. A. B.STEWART Acting Medical Officer of Health 5. SECTION "A" - VITAL STATISTICS AREA: The area of the Borough is 587 acres. POPULATION: The Registrar-General's estimate of resident civilian population was 26,740. In 1938 the estimated population was 56,960. BIRTHS: The total number of live births belonging to the Borough occurring during 1944 was 427, including 47 illegitimate births, and consisting of 229 males and 198 females, giving a birth rate of 16.0 per 1,000 population. The total number of births during 1943 was 466. STILL-BIRTHS: The total number of still-births allocated to the Borough during the year was 11. This figure represents 2.51% of the total births, and .41 per 1,000 civilian population, compared with .42 for London Administrative County and .50 for England and Wales. \ DEATHS: The total number of deaths belonging to the Borough registered during 1944 was 533, consisting of 281 males and 252 females, giving a death rate per 1,000 population of 19.9. The total number for 1943 was 487. COMPARATIVE STATISTICS 1938 - 1944 Owing to the ban on the publication of population figures during the war some of the following information, which is based on statistical data supplied by the Registrar-General, has not appeared in previous annual reports: 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 Population 56,960 55,110 40,090 30,280 28,420 27,830 26,740 Birth rate (per 1000 population) 13.0 12.5 14.3 14.8 15.9 16.7 16.0 Death rate ( -do- ) 12.9 13.6 23.1 24.7 17.9 17.5 19.9 Maternal Mortality (per 1000 live births) 4.05 0 3.68 2.8 4.4 2.1 2.4 Death rate, infants under 1 ( -do- ) 73 33.5 68 70.4 64 56 47 Death rate of illegitimate infants under 1 (per 1000 illeglive births) 51 131.6 167 125 76.9 83.3 128 Still births (percentage of total births) 4.9 2.3 2.6 4.0 4.04 2.92 2.51 T.B.Death rate per 1000 inhabitants (all forms) 0.67 0.78 1.77 1.65 1.72 1.33 1.46 Illegitimate Births. 39. 38. 36. 33. 39. 24. 47. 6.

SECTION "B" - GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES TREATMENT CENTRES AND CLINICS. The attendances at the various Treatment Centres and Clinics have shown a steady expansion since their inception and there were record attendances in the Dental and Foot Clinics. ATTENDANCES &C.

As from 1st July, 1944, the Council decided to restrict the treatments available at the above clinics to inhabitants of the Borough only. Facilities for treatment had previously been afforded to non-resident workers in the area in addition to residents. This decision was taken at a time when the attendances of residents were increasing, with the result that there was no appreciable reduction in the work of the clinics. LABORATORY; Routine examinations of swabs, sputum, milks, &c., have continued to be carried out at the Laboratory in the Health Centre and the following is a brief summary of the work undertaken - No.of throat and nasal swabs examined 370 No.of sputums examined for T.B 173 Milk samples 128 The Council continued the arrangement whereby special examinations are undertaken at the Archway Group Laboratories by the L.C.C.Group Pathologist, Doctor J.M.Alston. 8. INQUESTS: Inquests were held on 22 residents during the year, the findings being as follows: Bronchitis 2 Suicide 3 Road Accidents 4 Misadventure 9 Violence 2 Cerebral Thrombosis 1 Arsenical Dermatitis 1 MATERNAL MORTALITY: There was one maternal death during the year giving a maternal mortality rate of 2.28 per 1,000 Total (Live and Still) Births. INFANTILE MORTALITY: There were 20 deaths amongst infants under one year of age and the infant mortality rate based on 1,000 live births was 47. The following are comparative infant mortality rates. INFANT MORTALITY RATES 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 FINSBURY 68 70 64 56 47 LONDON 50 68 60 58 61 ENGLAND & WALES 55 59 49 49 46 DEATHS IN RELATION TO DISEASE: During the year there was an increase of 46 in the number of deaths from 487 to 533, but of the 533 deaths 70 were due to violent causes. There were no deaths from Diphtheria, Measles, Typhoid or Scarlet Fever during the year. There has been a further fall in the infant mortality. It is gratifying to note that the Finsbury figure approximates to the figure for England and Wales. Having regard to local conditions this is a satisfactory achievment but there is still room for considerable improvement. 9. MUNICIPAL WELFARE CENTRES: The attendances at the two Municipal Maternity and Child Welfare Centres are briefly outlined in the following table and a comparison is shown with the figures which obtained in 1943: PINE STREET LEAGE STREET 1943 1944 1943 1944 Mothers, Individual 305 138 137 115 Mothers, Attendances 520 329 223 174 Children (1-5 yrs) Individual 415 441 249 221 Children (1-5 yrs) Attendances 3,345 2,153 1,672 1,236 Babies, Individual 390 377 179 157 Babies, Attendances 3,835 2,700 1,844 1,272 GRANTS SCHEME: A total of 2,058 dinners were granted to necessitous persons at the two Centres, under the provisions of the Council's Maternity and Chief Welfare Grants Scheme.. Towards the end of the year the Council extended their arrangements for the supply of dinners to provide for selected cases ho were outside the income group for free dinners. A charge was made for such cases at the rate of l/3d. per dinner for adults and 6d per dinner for children under 5 years. 743 lbs. of Dried Milk were also issued to necessitous persons free of charge; 339 lbs. were issued at half cost and 4,241 lbs at cost price. PRIORITY DOCKETS FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS: In accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular 154/44 arrangements were made through the Maternity and Child Welfare Services for the issue of priority dockets to enable expectant mothers, being confined at home, to obtain a supply of utility sheets. HEALTH VISITING: The regular visitation of expectant mothers and children under five years was continued by the Health Visitors and during the year a < total of 9,740 visits were made by the Council Staff in addition to visits made by the officers from certain Voluntary Centres in the borough. The following special cases necessitated frequent visits by the Health Visitors:- Nature of Case No.of cases Results Prematurity 4 Died - 2 Marasmus 1 Satisfactory - 25 Illegitamacy 24 Removed to other Twins 7 areas â€” 6 Poor Progress 3 Still special Under Weight 2 at end of year - 9. Unsatisfactory enviroment 1 10. VOLUNTARY CENTRES: The Council has continued grants to the undermentioned Voluntary Centres and a brief outline of the work carried out at those Centres is shown below: INSTITUTION NO. of MEETINGS HELD NO. of ATTENDANCES City of London Maternity Hospital 312 286 (Finsbury) Claremont Central Mission 96 546 Maternity Nursing Association 256 1701 Women's League of Service 52 1269 NURSERIES: The Finsbury Evacuated Nursery remained throughout the year at Bourn Hill Farm, Woodchester, Gloucester, and at the close of the year there was a total of 24 children resident there; of these 9 were Finsbury children. Five Wartime Nurseries wore in operation in the borough during the year. The Donegal Street Wartime Nursery was opened in August with a capacity for 65 - 71 children. The Claremont Nursery was closed temporarily during the same month due to the low attendances attributed to the Flying Bomb attacks, and has not since been re-opened. Banner Street. Nursery was closed during August and September, due to damage by a Flying Bomb. The following table shows the average daily attendances: JAN. FEB. MAR. APR. MAY. JUN. JUL. AUG. SEPT. OCT. NOV. DEC.

Even during the period when attendances were low it was not always possible to have the full complement of staff. Probationers often find that they have no aptitude for nursing; the nurseries serve a useful purpose here in being a testing ground prior to hospital work, but it is small consolation to the Matrons in their difficult task of making do with available staff. HOME NURSING: The arrangements with the Metropolitan District Nursing Association to undertake the nursing of cases of illness occurring in expectant and nursing mothers and the nursing of children under five years of ago suffering from any illness at home, was continued throughout the year. 11. EVACUATION: Arrangements were made through the Borough Council for the evacuation of 36 children under 5 years and 97 Expectant Mothers, during the year. NATIONAL MILK AND VITAMINS SCHEME: The Municipal and Voluntary Centres continued to operate as distributing points for vitamin products and national dried, milk. MIDWIFERY: Under the Council's Midwifery arrangements as detailed in previous annual reports the following numbers of patients were admitted to the various hospitals. (a) St. Bartholomew's Hospital 85 (b) The Royal Northern Hospital 1 (c) The City of London Maternity Hospital 12 (d) The University College Hospital 11 Co-operation was maintained between the Hospitals concerned and the Maternity and Child Welfare Department. Attendances at ante-natal clinics are notified and ante-natal visits are made by our Health Visitors. CARE OF PREMATURE INFANTS: A space has been provided in the notification of Birth Cards for the Weight at Birth when this is 5Â½1bs or less. Close co-operation is maintained with the hospitals which ensures a follow-up of all cases after discharge from hospital and all premature infants are regarded as "Special Cases" necessitating frequent visits by the Health Visitors. Special Equipment is available for loan in the home, consisting of draught proof cots with detachable linings, warm and suitable clothing, hot water bottles and special feeding bottles. The Council's Home Help Service is also made available for such cases. During the year there were 27 births notified where the birth weight was 5Â½lbs or less, 13 of which were in respect of premature births. 7 of these were nursed at home and 6 in hospital and all survived at the end of one month. POST NATAL CLINIC: In June, 1942, a post natal clinic was started at the Pine Street Maternity and Child Welfare Centre and mothers attending the municipal welfare clinics were urged to attend this clinic if they had not boon given an appointment elsewhere. 46 clinics wore held during the year and 98 individuals attended on 239 occasions. Attendances at this clinic have boon good and it has done much useful work. Many of the mothers coming for examination have needed treatment for local minor gynaecological conditions and for their general health. 12. HOME HELPS: The Council provides a service of Home Helps during the post natal and ante natal period for domiciliary cases. Despite the fact that it has boon difficult to got enough people to do this work, the Homo Help Service has boon maintained and has worked satisfactorily. 62 applications for this service wore received during the year, 4 of which were withdrawn. At the end of the year the panel of Home Helps consisted of four persons. HOSPITAL TREATMENT The arrangement between the Council and the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital for the retention of one cot has persisted throughout the year and has worked very satisfactorily. There were 6 admissions to this cot during the year. In addition, the Council has an arrangement with the Royal Free Hospital, University College Hospital and the Queen's Hospital for Children whereby 30/-d per week is paid for any cot occupied by a Finsbury child, but there was no occasion to use these facilities during the year. EAR, NOSE AND THROAT HOSPITALS: The Royal Free Hospital has continued to admit Finsbury children requiring tonsillectomy. Similar arrangements exist with the Control London Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital and Archway Hospital. Special mention must bo made of the assistance rendered by Mr. Milloy F.R.C.S. Medical Superintendent of Archway Hospital, who has dealt promptly with cases who had been on waiting lists elsewhere. PUERPERAL FEVER AND PEURPERAL PYREXIA: During 1944 there was one case of puerperal pyrexia and no cases of puerperal fever notified in Finsbury. This gives a rate per 1,000 Live and Still births of 2.29 as compared with 10.34 for England and Wales and 14.14 for the London Administrative County. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM: The number of cases of Opthalmia Neonatorum notified was 4. Two of the cases were treated at home and two in hospital. In no case was there impairment of vision. CONVALESCENT TREATMENT: The Council has continued their arrangement with the Dedisham Convalescent Home where two cots are retained and with Noel Home, Letchworth where four cots are retained. The number of children admitted to these Homes during the year was 16. In addition, children are referred for convalescence through the Invalid Children's Aid Association which has dealt with 21 cases during the year. 13. The Council has also continued their arrangements with the London Council of Social Service whereby four beds are reserved at Grand Street House, Worplesdon Hill, Surrey, where mothers and children can bo sent away together. Under this scheme mothers with one or more children between one and five are sent to this Homo, usually for a three weeks period. There were 15 mothers and 18 children admitted to this Homo during 1944. The Home has proved extremely useful and a certain number of young mothers suffering from post natal debility have benefited markedly from convalescence there. It was found necessary to close the children's section as from the end of November 1944, and unaccompanied mothers only have been admitted since that time. FOSTER PARENTS: There were no registered foster mothers in Finsbury at the end of 1944. INFANT DEATHS: There wore 20 infant deaths in Finsbury during 1944 and the mortality rate based on 1,000 live births was 47. The neo-natal deaths, i.e., occuring within the first twenty-eight days, numbered 7, details of these deaths are as follows:- Gastro enteritis 1 Hydrocephalus 1 Broncho-pnoumonia 1 Haemophilia 1 Other causes 3 Deaths of children from one month to one year 13. Analysis of cases shows:- Gastro enteritis 6 Broncho-pneumonia 5 Asphyxia 1 Whooping Cough 1 ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN: The Council accepted in principle the Metropolitan Standing Joint Committee recommendation regarding the guaranteed uniform payment of foster mothers, i.e. 17/6 per week up to the age of one year, and thereafter 15/- per week.

ORGANISATION: The employment of six men from the Light Rescue Service on their "Off duty" days was continued throughout the year, three men operating each day. All the men have attended the Ministry of Food training course, and have had considerable practical experience. The methods used are those recommended by the Ministry, whose research department issues details of new developments in methods and materials. The headquarters of the Infestation Branch of the Ministry of Food is in Blooms bury and this department has on a number of occasions found demonstration sites for the Branch's courses of instruction. At one site, excellent photographs were taken by Professor Hewer, to illustrate the work of the Infestation Branch. BLOCK CONTROL: Block treatment as required by the Minister's "Direction" of the 9th November 1943, commenced during the year, and a considerable part of the Borough north of Pentonville Road was treated in this manner. SEWER TREATMENT: The second "Directed" treatment was carried out in January, resulting in an estimated kill of 2,213 rats. Very few bodies were found on this occasion, as the poison used was slow in action, and was not likely to take effect until the rats were back in their homes, which are invariably outside the sewers. No further "directions" have been issued by the Ministry in this connection, but a recommendation was contained in circular N.S.6.(29th August, l944) that sewers should be treated every six months in the periods May/June, and November/December. The modified treatment suggested by the Ministry was used by the department. This maintenance treatment takes only three days as against the seven days of the initial "directed" treatments. The time saving is brought about by reducing the number of prebaiting days, and dispensing with the poison take check. It is thus possible for the regular sewer staff to treat the whole of the sewer system of the borough, section by section in fifteen days. As there is no check on the amount of poison bait taken by the rats, no estimate can be made of the number killed, but it is proposed to keep a graph with the information available. This should give a fair indication of the degree of infestation in the sewers. Preliminary figures for the first maintenance treatment in progress at the end of the year suggests the sewers were as badly infested in December 1944 as in December 1943, and I feel it was most unfortunate that almost a year should have elapsed between the second directed treatment and the first maintenance treatment. It is to be hoped that regular six monthly treatments will keep the rat population at a much lower level than formerly. Apart from the obvious desirability of reducing the number of rats in the sewers, these treatments undoubtedly benefit the residents of the borough, as many surface infestations reported during the 1943 publicity campaign were found to have ceased when visits were made preparatory to action under the block control scheme. CHARGES: Until October no charge was made for treating dwelling houses, but following representations by the Ministry of Food, pointing out the legal responsibility of occupiers to rid their premises of rats and mice, the Committee decided to make a nominal charge of 2/6d per house in these cases. Charges for other premises continue to be submitted to the Committee for approval. 19.

EUSACO STREUT AREA: The proposed rehousing site was inspected and reported upon with a view to gaining control of the whole area by clearance or other means. A start was made towards the end of the year to the erection of "Uni-seco" huts for the temporary housing of homeless families. It is hoped that 75 such huts will be built on vacant sites in the borough. This measure can be but a small contribution to a big problem but the number of vacant suitable sites is not large in this congested borough. 21.

The 22. Bakehouses (contd). quinquennial survey of the basement bakehouses under the provisions of section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937, was carried out during the year. Following the consideration of the report the Council decided to prolong the certificates of suitability in each case for a further period of five years. Adulteration of Food: The total number of samples taken in 1944 under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, was 749 of which 27 were formal samples and 722 informal samples. The following table gives full information with regard to the formal samples submitted to Mr. Kear Colwell, the Council's Public Analyst.

Salvage Division (Ministry of Food): Examination of foodstuffs-have again been carried out in co-operation with the Minister of Food's Salvage Officers. The examinations were necessitated as the result of enemy action and from loss of labels etc. to packages during transport by the carrier firms in the Borough. Ice Cream: Under the provisions of S.R.&.0.1944, No.1280, which revoked the Ice-cream (Prohibition of Manufacture and Sales) Order, 1942, the manufacture and sale of Ice-cream with skimmed milk powder became permissible after the 15th November, 1944. Very little Icecream was in fact made or sold within the area during the remainder of the year, owing to the season and to the difficulties in obtaining the necessary ingredients. 24.

The Council's T.B.Dispensary machinery is used for the institution of the necessary enquiries and for the presenting of the applications weekly to the Social Welfare Officer. During the year 42 new applications were dealt with and there were 64 persons who received maintenance allowances 5c 29 who received special allowances. In addition to new cases, 294 were presented to the Assessment Officer for review. The total cash allowances paid out during the year was Â£2,193. 0s. od. PROVISION OF EXTRA NOURISHMENT; The Borough Council has continued to provide extra nourishment for certain types of tuberculosis cases. 51 persons were granted extra nourishment during the year. The arrangements In the Chest Clinic have remained unaltered during the year. The cordial relationship between the Care Committee Secretary, Mr. Ward, and the Chest Clinic staff has proved invaluable in the work connected with the Maintenance Allowances Scheme
