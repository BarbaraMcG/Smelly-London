Medical Officer of Health to the Council together with the ANNUAL REPORT of W. K. PICKUP, M.R.S.H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council East Barnet Urban District Council EIGHTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1959 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council. I have the honour to present my report for the year 1959. This year there are two main items from the Analysis of Vital Statistics which need perhaps some explanation. It will be seen that the Infant Mortality under one year is considerably greater than for some years past and it is not possible to give any adequate explanation for this increase. True, the total figures involved are so small that it is unwise to draw any definite conclusions but the figure is nevertheless disquieting. In particular the increase in congenital abnormalities causing death—yet it would be unwise to theorise at this stage. Secondly, it will be seen that there has been a considerable increase in the number of notified cases of Sonne Dysentery. This infection has become almost endemic and there must be a vastly greater number of cases than the total notified. It appears that many of the milder infections clear up on their own and without treatment, although taking far longer than they would had they been given treatment. Although strict precautions have to be taken where such infections occur in day nurseries, infant schools or canteens etc., where food handling occurs, in the case of the average child the infection often clears on its own without any apparent detriment to the child. Poliomyelitis immunisation continues to increase and it is to be hoped that people have now come to accept this procedure as normal and well worth while. Active opposition is negligible. 3 No apology is needed for referring again to housing—the details are given in the Chief Public Health Inspector's report. One satisfactory part of the problem is that many of the older houses are being brought to a reasonable state of repair and so removed from the Schedule of Unfit Houses. But the figures still show that we have a considerable way to go before any real satisfaction can be experienced with the progress of Slum Clearance. It is to be hoped that once the de-requisitioning problem has been ended an increased rate can be maintained. In the meantime a number of special cases have been sympathetically dealt with, and there can be no doubt that the number of these cases is likely to increase steadily. Overcrowding persists in many houses and even though the figures needed to produce statutory overcrowding are not always reached there is frequently a degree of overcrowding which to most people would appear definitely detrimental to health and happiness. Work in connection with the Clean Air Act, 1956, is proceeding steadily and will eventually prove to be of great benefit to Public Health, however much most of us will regret the disappearance of the open fire, no one can deny that the benefits accruing from its disappearance will outweigh the sentimental attachment we have formed. Food Hygiene has not been neglected and the increase in informal samples taken, is, I think, a step to be welcomed. In conclusion, the year has been a busy one for the Department— and the extra work involved (particularly with regard to the Clean Air Act) has been cheerfully and energetically undertaken by every member of my staff, to whom my very sincere thanks are due. The invaluable helpful co-operation of the Chief Officers and Staff of all departments is also thankfully recorded. C. M.

The Registrar General's mid-year estimate of population for 1959 is 41,360, an increase of 140 on the previous year and an increase of 390 on 1957. There is a slight increase of population year by year which is probably due to natural causes. The number of persons per house has increased now being 3.34. In 1958 this figure showed a decrease on the preceeding year but the figure for 1959 is still below that of 1957. 2. The number of live births has decreased by 63 compared with 1958 and 15 compared with 1957. The birth rate for the district has dropped this year and is below the average for the last five years. In comparison with the rest of England and Wales the difference has increased. This, however, may only be an exceptional year, the next few years will show whether or not the rate for the district is tending to decrease. The number of illegitimate births has increased over 1958, being 19 as compared with 14. However, the average illegitimate births over the last ten years is 18.5 per annum and has fluctuated in that period between 9 & 35 in any one year. 3. The death rate for the year shows a very slight drop on 1958 and as can be seen from the graph is below that of the rest of the country. The average rate for the last six years for this district is 10.3. The method of calculating the death rate was changed in 1953 and the figures prior to that date cannot be compared with later figures. This year for the first time the figures compiled by the Public Health Department show a considerable difference to those supplied by the Registrar General—our figures being 17 less. In spite of all efforts and methods of checking it has not been possible to find where this difference has occurred and the figures used in this report are those compiled by the Public Health Department. 4. This has been a very bad year in regard to infantile mortality there having been 20 deaths of infants under one year, giving a rate of 43.1 per 1,000 live births. This figure is more than double the average rate for the last 6 years, of 21.1. 5. The total deaths from Cancer in 1959 is 68 as compared with 87 in 1958 and 1957. The number of deaths from Cancer of the 12 lung in 1959 was 22, an increase over 1958. Over the last four years the average number of deaths from Cancer of the lung has been 19.7. 6. In Table IV which lists the new cases of Tuberculosis and deaths from that disease, it will be seen that there were 16 new cases and one death. These figures continue to show a decrease year by year and when compared with the average for 10 years which is 33.2 new cases and 5.7 deaths per annum, the improvement can be appreciated. In 1950 the figures were 59 and 18 respectively and it is, therefore, obvious that there is a general decrease in the incidence of this disease. 7. Infectious diseases (Table I) show a large increase this year upon 1958, there being 789 notifications but these diseases vary by large numbers year by year. The average number of cases notified over the last ten years is 731.2 per annum. The main disease causing these figures is Measles which appears to run in cycles. The largest figure being 1,473 and the lowest 242. There has been a large increase in the number of cases of Sonne Dysentery notified but this seems to be general of the whole of this area. There were nine cases of Food Poisoning, the majority of which had no connection with each other except in the cases of families. 13 East Barnet Urban District Council REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1959 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council. I have the honour to present my eighth annual report to the Council. The work in the Department has increased very considerably during 1959 and the number of visits made, have increased by nearly 1,000. This increase does not in itself reflect a true picture of the increase which has been far greater than this number indicates. In 1958 work was started on a pilot survey for the first Smoke Control Order in East Barnet. In 1959 the detailed survey of this Area was made and a pilot survey of the second area completed. The amount of work entailed in preparing a Smoke Control Order cannot be assessed entirely by an increase in visits as the very considerable increase in office and administrative work is not shown. The amount of time spent on this work is bound to increase year by year as the Orders become operative and further areas are dealt with. In 1960 the problem of requisitioned houses will have been solved in the main, and it is hoped that dealing with unfit houses and Clearance Areas will be accelerated. Over the last two years the Council's programme for slum clearance has fallen sadly in arrears due to no fault of the Council. However, as soon as the way is clear every endeavour will be made to reduce these arrears. The number of applications made for Certificates under the Rent Act remains very small there only being 7 in 1959. This figure is to me surprisingly low when the number of tenanted houses which have had large rent increases is considered 14 The very good summer last year, while being exceptionally welcome, brought a spate of complaints regarding wasp nests. Indeed, at times there were so many that the whole of the available staff were engaged on destruction of nests, and other work came to a standstill. It was only by working overtime that complete chaos was prevented. The work of the Department during the year has been very satisfactory and in spite of at times being excessive, all the normal duties have been dealt with; and the additional work kept up to date. It is quite obvious that the additional duties the Clean Air Act has involved has brought the amount of work in the Department to a state where the existing staff is too small to deal with it efficiently. In conclusion, I wish to tender my thanks and appreciation to the staff of the Public Health Department for their co-operation and endeavours in keeping the work of the Department up-to-date in spite of the increases and in particular to my Deputy, Mr. S. C. Smith. I also wish to thank all the other Officers of the Council for their assistance and co-operation. W. K. Pickup, Chief Public Health Inspector. 15 TABLE I Table of Visits and Inspections made during the Year PUBLIC HEALTH 1958 1959 Nuisances and Sanitary Defects 3,834 3,679 Infectious Diseases 153 347 Schools 85 41 Brooks and Streams 44 12 Verminous Premises 6 1 Hairdressers and Barbers 20 4,142 18 4,428 HOUSING Housing Act, 1936, Part 2 712 870 Permitted Numbers and Overcrowding 281 163 Applicants for Housing (Special Cases) 48 1,041 74 1,207 FOOD HYGIENE Restaurants and Snack Bars 451 391 Fish Shops 185 137 Butchers' Shops 391 323 Bakehouses 55 26 Ice Cream Premises 243 217 Other Food Shops and Premises 722 699 Food Inspections 205 225 Milk (Special Designations) Registrations 98 2,350 71 2,089 FACTORIES Factories 189 151 Outworkers 98 287 39 190 INFESTATIONS Rat and Mouse 2,668 2,583 Insects 176 2,844 325 2,908 FOOD AND DRUGS Sampling and in connection therewith 479 479 326 326 SHOPS ACTS Visits made 593 593 498 498 CLEAN AIR ACT Visits made 418 418 1,656 1,656 12,154 13,072 Page Sixteen TABLE II HOUSING ACT, 1936 and 1957 Demolition Orders 5 Closing Orders 4 Houses demolished as a result of Orders 1 Closing Orders determined 3 Clearance Areas declared under Section 25— Clearance Areas 1 Houses in above Areas 12 NUMBER OF NOTICES SERVED DURING THE YEAR 1958 1959 Informal Notices 67 60 Statutory Notices 16 8 Result of the service of these Notices as follows: 1958 1959 1958 1959 Preliminary Notices Statutory Notices Complied with 69 51 16 9 Work in progress or in hand at end of year 3 2 1 1 Not complied with 8 15 2 1 TABLE III IMPROVEMENTS EFFECTED AS A RESULT OF NOTICES SERVED Exterior No. of Houses Roofs repaired and made weathertight 24 Rainwater pipes and rainwater gutters cleaned, repaired or renewed 23 Chimney pots and flues repaired 6 Brickwork repaired or repointed 8 Rendering repaired or renewed 2 Damp walls remedied 26 Choked drains cleared 14 Soil and vents repaired or renewed 4 Drains repaired or relaid 22 Exterior paving relaid or repaired 2 Dustbins renewed 13 Accumulation of refuse removed 4 Interior Wallplaster repaired or re-plastered 10 Ceilings repaired or re-plastered 9 Sinks renewed 7 Page Seventeen Wastepipes repaired or renewed 3 W.C.'s and fittings repaired or renewed 14 Insufficient water supplies remedied 3 Stairs and staircases repaired or renewed 2 Floors and skirtings repaired or renewed 5 Doors and frames repaired or renewed 6 Window frames and sills repaired or renewed 12 Sash cords renewed 10 TABLE IV FACTORY INSPECTIONS Factories Act, 1937 Inspections for the purposes of provisions as to Health Premises No. on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Factories without mechanical power 10 18 – Factories in which mechanical power is used 89 133 3 Totals 99 151 3 Cases in which Defects Were Found Number of cases in which defects were found reffered Particulars Found Remedied To H.M.

The visits are divided under various sub-headings and the figures for 1958 are given for purposes of comparison. On the total of visits in Table I there has been an increase of approximately 900 visits. The increases are largely due to the Clean Air Act although there are small increases on Public Health housing inspections, these mainly being cancelled by decreases in the remainder of the headings. NUISANCES AND SANITARY DEFECTS The visits under this heading are less than the number made in 1958 by 155 although the number of complaints made by the public are slightly higher. These visits are those which are made on the primary inspection following a complaint and subsequent visits to ascertain that the complaint has been remedied. Consequently the number of visits and complaints are closely related, and usually vary in direct relationship. The fact that while visits have fallen, complaints have risen slightly, is accounted for by less follow up or subsequent visits being necessary. All complaints are, of course, visited. The number of preliminary notices served in the year is less than in the previous year (Table II). This, together with the previous figures shows the general tendency for complaints to be of a less serious character so that they can be dealt with by personal contact with the owners of property and other persons responsible for the nuisance. Table III which lists the repairs carried out as the results of notices served on owners remains very much the same as in previous years. INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND FOOD POISONING The number of visits made under this heading during the year has more than doubled. If Table I in the Medical Officer's report is consulted it will be seen that the number of cases of Scarlet Fever, Dysentery and Food Poisoning increased very considerably in 1958. This in itself is of little importance as the number of cases of these diseases does fluctuate widely. During the year there were nine cases of Food Poisoning as compared with one case in 1958. These cases were not related except where several cases occurred in the same family. Every effort is made Page Twenty in every case to trace the source of the infection although in cases which apparently occur sporadically the possibility is slight. VERMINOUS PREMISES Only one visit was made during the year regarding verminous premises, this figure is so low that no comment is necessary. SCHOOLS, BROOKS & STREAMS, HAIRDRESSERS & BARBERS PREMISES These are routine inspections and justify little comment, they do not vary to any extent year by year. FACTORIES Routine visits to factories and outworkers for the purpose of the Factories Act were made during the year, a total of 151 inspections being made. Two contraventions of the Act were found and one was referred to the department by H.M. Inspector of Factories. The two contraventions found on inspection were lack of cleanliness in the sanitary conveniences, and the contravention referred to us by H.M. Inspector of Factories was lack of a ventilated space between the sanitary conveniences and the work rooms. All these contraventions were remedied on the service of informal notices. SHOPS ACT Routine inspections of shops under this Act have continued, and no serious contraventions have been observed during the year. These inspections have to be made outside office hours and on Sundays in order to ascertain that the closing hours and the provisions regarding Sunday trading are being observed. During the year an application was received for the registration of a shop under Section 53 of the Act by a person observing the Jewish Sabbath. The application was accompanied by the requisite statutory declaration. It was known, however, that the applicant had, in fact, traded on the Jewish Sabbath in the past and an application was, therefore, made to the London Committee of Deputies of the British Jews for them to test whether the declaration was genuine. The case was, in due course, considered by the Committee who decided that the conscientious objection on religious grounds to trading on the Jewish Sabbath was not genuinely held by the applicant. The Council therefore revoked the registration under Section 53. Page Twenty-one HOUSING Progress in reducing the number of premises on the Council schedule of unfit houses has been slow during the year. Only five Demolition Orders, and four Closing Orders have been made and one Clearance Area declared. The reason for this tardy progress has been due to the Requisitioned Houses and Housing Amendments Act, 1955 with its responsibility for the de-requisitioning of houses. In addition to the above figures, approximately 17 houses which were on the list of unfit houses have been made fit by voluntary action by the owners and subsequently removed from the schedule. The Clearance Area which has been declared during the period under review is in Edward Road, New Barnet, consisting of 12 houses, being Nos. 32 to 54 inclusive. This area will not provide any additional land for rebuilding as it is scheduled as Industrial under the Town Planning Scheme. The area was declared in November, 1959, and the period for objections has not yet elapsed, so it is not known whether or not an Enquiry will be held. At the beginning of 1959 there were two houses on which Demolition Orders had been served and the premises not demolished and six Closing Orders. The premises on which Demolition Orders were operative were as follows: 54 Edward Road, New Barnet—Demolition Order served. 37 Hadley Highstone, Hadley—Demolition Order served 1958. 65/65a Church Hill Road, East Barnet—Demolition Order served 1957. The premises on which Closing Orders were operative being: 107 Leicester Road, New Barnet 55 Lyonsdown Road, New Barnet Basement Flat, 49 Lyonsdown Road, New Barnet 21 Victoria Road, New Barnet 70 East Barnet Road, New Barnet 16 Welbeck Road, East Barnet. There are also five confirmed Clearance Areas affecting fifty-six houses which have not yet been demolished although the majority of the houses in these areas are vacant. There is no area in which all the houses have been vacated. Page Twenty-two Referring to the outstanding Demolition and Closing Orders, 54 Edward Road has been included in the Clearance Area declared during the year; 37 Hadley Highstone has been demolished; and no action has been taken on 65/65a Church Hill Road, although the premises are now vacant. The Closing Order on 107 Leicester Road has been revoked and a Demolition Order substituted. The Closing Orders on 49 Lyonsdown Road, 21 Victoria Road and 16 Welbeck Road have been determined as the premises have been made fit for habitation. As a result of reports and representations made to the Housing Committee at the end of 1958 and during 1959, action as detailed has been taken with regard to the following properties. Edward Road Clearance Area: The Medical Officer of Health made representation to the Committee with regard to the Clearance Area affecting premises in the above road in November, 1959. This area consists of 12 houses, being numbers 32 to 54 inclusive and consists of a terrace of cottages Nos. 44 to 54, a terrace of four houses 36 to 42 and two of a terrace of four houses Nos. 32 and 34. Of these houses No. 54 is the subject of a Demolition Order and No. 50 is vacant derelict property. The Council made a Clearance Order which has not yet been confirmed. 41 Lancaster Road: At the end of 1958 these premises were under consideration by the Committee and in January the Council made a Closing Order in respect of these premises. They consisted of a three storey house with a shop on the ground floor. The premises were vacated and the owner subsequently voluntarily demolished the house and shop. 20 Gloucester Road : This property consists of a detached house, brick built with a slate roof, a two storey annexe on the right flank and a flat roofed addition on the left. It is comprised of twelve rooms including four kitchens, one bathroom and two internal W.C.'s, and was used as four flats. A report regarding this property was made to the Committee in April, and in October a Demolition Order was served. 48a East Barnet Road: These premises are part of a semi-detached brick building with a slate roof known as Nos. 46, 48, 46a, 48a, East Barnet Road. The parts numbered 46 and 48 being lock-up shops and 46a and 48a, self-contained flats. No. 48a consists of four rooms Page Twenty-three and a scullery and was the subject of a report to the Committee in July. The Committee subsequently made a Closing Order on this part of the building. 90 East Barnet Road: These premises are part of a terrace of nine shops with living accommodation at the rear and on the first floor. It consists of two rooms and a scullery on the ground floor and three rooms on the first floor. This part of the building was subject of a report to the Committee in May, and, after due consideration a Closing Order was served in October. 24 Henry Road: This property is a detached three storeyed house, comprising of eight rooms, three kitchens, bathroom and two internal W.C.'s. It was let as three flats. In May it was the subject of a report to the Committee and they, after consideration, served a Demolition Order on the premises in October. 26 Henry Road: This property is a similar house to 24 Henry Road and was reported to the Committee in May. In October the Committee served a Demolition Order on the premises. 7 Victoria Road: A report was made to the Committee in May, concerning the basement rooms at the above premises. These rooms being underground rooms within the meaning of Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957. The Committee, after due consideration, served a Closing Order on these rooms in October. 74 & 76 Leicester Road: This is a pair of semi-detached houses in which one house has two rooms in the front and one at the rear, while the other house of the pair has one front room and two rear rooms. The houses were the subject of a report to the Committee in April and the Committee after due consideration served Demolition Orders on both houses in October. 109 Leicester Road: This house was the subject of a report to the Committee in April, a Demolition Order was served. This house is part of a pair of semi-detached houses, No. 107 the other house of the pair is mentioned earlier in this part of the Report. The owner of these houses appealed against the Demolition Orders, the appeal was adjourned sine-die and has not yet come before the County Court. RENT ACT, 1957 In the year 1959 seven applications for Certificates of Disrepair were received and in two cases undertakings were received from the landlords to carry out the works and in the other cases the necessary Page Twenty-four Certificates of Disrepair were issued. Under Paragraph 8 (2) of the First Schedule of the Act, two Certificates were issued. This paragraph deals with the issue of Certificates to landlords or occupiers stating whether or not work detailed on an undertaking has been carried out in a satisfactory manner; it is not obligatory on a landlord to apply for such certificate on completion of works and in fact many do not do so. In five cases applications from the landlords for the cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair were made and as no objections were received from the tenants the Certificates were cancelled. As mentioned in my report for 1958, the number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair has been, surprisingly, very low for the number of tenants who could make a successful application for such a Certificate is high. FOOD HYGIENE During the year 2,089 visits were made to various food premises in the district. These visits show a decrease of 261 over the number made in 1958. This decrease was due to the time spent during the latter part of the year by the Inspectors inspecting properties in connection with the proposed Smoke Control Order No. 1. Some types of premises and trades required more frequent visits than others and this fact is reflected in the figures for restaurants, snack bars and butchers shops. In my report for 1958, I commented on the fact that although the Food Hygiene Regulations had been in operation since 1955 it was still necessary to remind assistants in food premises of the importance of observing hygienic practices at all times when handling open food. Whilst the general conditions of food premises is without doubt gradually improving it has still been necessary to draw the attention of some food handlers to practices which are unhygienic. The number of part time workers now employed in the food distributing trade makes the Inspectors task more difficult. A call made during the morning and comments made to staff then might well prove useful. A subsequent visit made in the afternoon can reveal at least 50 per cent different staff. Some customers also are not so particular in respect of hygienic practices as one would like to see them. Whilst expecting cleanly conditions behind the counter too many are still prepared to smoke Page Twenty-five near open food whilst waiting to be served or to allow their dogs to roam unhindered about the shop. More shops have fitted glass or plastic screening during the year and this is particularly satisfactory in bakers shops where the base of the window is apt to be lower than in other food shops. MILK SUPPLY The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1956-1959. Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 10 Sterilised 13 The following supplementary licences under Principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area were also granted. Tuberculin Tested 8 Pasteurised 8 Sterilised 7 84 Samples of milk were purchased and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health Public Health Laboratory at Coppetts Wood. There was only one unsatisfactory sample of milk. ICE CREAM One application was received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises and equipment being satisfactory, the application was granted. 92 Samples of ice cream were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination. All the samples were reported Provisional Grade 1. This is the first time that I have been able to report all the samples of Ice Cream taken during the year as being Grade 1. There are no premises manufacturing ice cream for sale in the district. All ice cream sold is obtained from large wholesale firms. Page Twenty-six MEAT AND OTHER FOOD INSPECTIONS The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been carried out as regards all premises on which meat is sold for human consumption. The inspection of food (other than meat) is carried out as necessary. As may be seen from the Table of foods surrendered as unfit during the year a total amount of approximately 3£ cwts. of food was condemned. This was disposed of by burying, all meat and meat products being stained first. FOOD AND DRUGS The following Table shows the various types of food and drugs sampled during the year: No. of Samples Analysed No. of Samples Analysed Blackcurrant Jam 1 Marmalade 1 Borscht 1 Meat Pudding 1 Butter 2 Milk 38 Buttered Rum Truffles 1 Milk (Channel Island and South Devon) 20 Cheese Spread 1 Chocolate Drink 1 Milk Bread 1 Coffee 1 Mint in Vinegar 1 Condensed Milk 1 Orange Drink 1 Crab Meat 1 Pastes: Crab Spread 1 Anchovy 1 Creamed Milk Pudding 1 Crab 2 Dairy Cream 1 Pilchard & Tomato 1 Egg Colouring 1 Pork Luncheon Meat 2 Egg Farfuls 1 Red Salmon 1 Evaporated Milk 1 Salmon Spread with butter 1 Flour 3 Silver Silds 1 Ground Almonds 2 Steak & Kidney Pudding 1 Ground Cinnamon 1 Ground Cloves 1 Soups: Ground Rice 1 Cream of Chicken 2 Ice Cream 4 Table Creams 1 Lard 1 Table Jelly 1 Lemon Curd 1 Tomato Cream 2 Lime Juice Cordial 1 Total 111 Margarine 1 Of the above mentioned samples four were reported as being unsatisfactory and I would like to comment briefly on these samples. Page Twenty-seven TOMATO CREAM This tomato preparation was sold in tubes and apart from the description "Tomato Cream" it was additionally described as being "Triple Concentrated Tomato Paste." Examination of the samples showed that they were in fact a tomato puree or paste and were in accord with the claim "Triple Concentrated However, the analysis showed they included no appreciable quantity of added fat and that the term "Tomato Cream" was not therefore an appropriate description for the preparation. The preparation was being sold by a firm of multiple grocers and when enquiries were made it was found that the product had been imported from Italy as long ago as 1956. The firm agreed immediately to withdraw the product from sale. PORK LUNCHEON MEAT A sample of an English product was found to contain 72 per cent of meat. There is no standard for meat content of luncheon meat but the manufacturers agreed that after 1st October, 1959, they would abide by the Code of Practice agreed between the Society of Public Analysts and the Food Manufacturers' Federation which recommended a meat content of 80 per cent. MILK BREAD A sample of milk bread was found to contain 0.6 per cent of nonfatty milk solids. The Report on Milk Bread of the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food published in October last, recommended that milk bread should contain at least 4.2 per cent of milk solids calculated on the weight of the loaf. This sample, therefore, contained only one-seventh of the amount of milk solids considered proper to milk bread. The baker when interviewed was under the impression that his mix for this type of bread was quite satisfactory. He was in fact using a well known brand of milk powder but his relying on "handfuls" rather than scales appeared responsible for the deficiency in the loaf produced. In addition to these unsatisfactory samples, complaints were also received during the year concerning a number of foodstuffs which were not in a sound state when purchased or which contained foreign bodies. Page Twenty-eight Examples of these types of complaint are listed below: BREAD One complaint received concerned alleged streaks of dirt in a small white loaf. Examination of the alleged dirt showed it to be small portions of wholemeal dough which had been loosened but not removed from the plant during the routine cleaning following the making of a batch of brown dough. Another loaf was found to contain a number of grease stains. If moulding machines and baking tins are not kept free of excessive grease this type of complaint is bound to arise and this fact is continually being impressed on local bakers. Much of the bread now sold in the district is manufactured outside the area. In one shop at least, bread is delivered daily from a wholesale bakery in the Midlands. When one considers the thousands of loaves sold in the district in the course of a year it is a tribute to the trade that only one complaint of this nature was received. Difficulty was experienced during the very hot weather with " cut and wrappedloaves. Mould growths form very quickly given favourable conditions and the "enriched" loaf wrapped warm in cellophane provides these conditions. Two complaints were received of loaves being mouldy. In each case they were bought on Saturdays and left in warm larders until Sunday teatime. A fourth complaint concerning a loaf of bread was received when a portion of a slicing blade of the cutting machine, 4½" long, was found between two slices of a cut and wrapped loaf. MILK BOTTLES Two complaints were made that milk bottles contained cement. The misuse of milk bottles is a problem that is ever with the Public Health Department and the dairy companies. It seems highly improbable that the general public will ever learn that the sole purpose of a milk bottle is that of holding milk. Until this is universally recognised, I fear that I shall be reporting annually on this type of complaint. LEMONADE A bottle of lemonade was alleged to have a strong smell of paraffin. Whilst no evidence of paraffin was found my remarks concerning milk bottles might very well apply to mineral water bottles. Page Twenty-nine BACON Two complaints were received during the very warm weather of bacon being sold in a fly blown condition. Inspection of the shops concerned showed that all reasonable precautions were being taken but the use of a bacon protectant dusting powder was recommended. No further complaints were received after this procedure was adopted. CIGARETTE END IN BUN A bun purchased at a local cafe but manufactured outside the district was found to contain a cigarette end. The proprietor of the cafe at subsequent court proceedings pleaded not guilty and alleged that the contravention of the Food & Drugs Act was due to the default of the person who had sold the bun to him. The baker concerned had been summoned by him to appear before the Court under Section 113 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. He pleaded guilty and was fined £3. WATER SUPPLY WATER SUPPLY The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company maintains an up-to-date laboratory under the direction of a fully qualified Chemist and Bacteriologist. During the year 1959 examinations were made of 1949 samples of water, of which number 1,352 were bacteriological examinations of water samples representative of supply. Every one of these latter samples was found to be free from Type 1 B. Coli in 100 ml. quantities. In addition, the Water Company submitted 99 samples of water for independant analysis during the year which included 63 bacteriological samples representative of supply. These 63 samples were also reported to be free of Type 1 B. Coli. Eleven samples were also taken by the Public Health Department and submitted to the Laboratory at Coppetts Wood Hospital. All these samples were reported satisfactory. OTHER INSPECTIONS PET SHOPS Four persons are licensed to keep pet shops in the district. Visits are made periodically to the premises and in each case the business has Page Thirty been found to be carried on satisfactorily. There has been need once again to stress the importance of a supply of water and sand being readily available in case of fire. INFESTATIONS RODENT CONTROL During the year 467 complaints of rats and mice have been received. All complaints have been visited, and in addition, premises neighbouring the houses from which the original complaints were received have been visited where necessary. In consequence 571 properties have been inspected for rat and mice infestations during the year. Of these properties 453 were found to be infested and were treated for infestations. The number of complaints received show a 50% increase over the previous year, probably due to the exceptional summer. However, the considerable increase in work was dealt with and the necessary treatments made. The infestations were all of a minor character although some are persistent and occur from year to year. Where difficulty is experienced re-treatment with a variation of poison and bait has produced satisfactory results. A 10 per cent Test Baiting of the sewer manholes was carried out during July. Twenty manholes showed "takes" and these were subsequently treated with warfarin with para-nitrophenol as a mould inhibitor. Inspections were made on the fourth, eighth and eleventh days after baiting. No "takes" were recorded at the last inspection. INSECT CONTROL The majority of complaints regarding infestations of premises by insects were those of carpet beetles, moths and wasps. All complaints were visited and advice given, and where necesary insecticides supplied free of cost. Wasp nests have been destroyed by the Council on payment of a small charge. Last summer when there was a countrywide increase in the number of wasps, 315 nests were dealt with, an increase of some 262 over 1958. This involved the department in a considerable amount of extra work over the period June-September. Page Thirty-one .
