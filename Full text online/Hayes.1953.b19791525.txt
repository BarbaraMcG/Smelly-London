Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hayes, Middlesex. June, 1954 To the Chairman and Members of the Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, The health of the district during 1953 has remained good and there has been no major epidemic. Although a large number of cases of whooping cough and measles were notified there was only one death from measles and the majority of cases of whooping cough were very mild, owing probably to the prevalence of immunisation against this disease. The vital statistics are satisfactory, both the birth rate of 13.84 and the death rate of 10.71 comparing favourably with the figures for England and Wales (see Page 5). There was one maternal death during the year; this was the first death for two years, and as it was due to pulmonary embolism, may be considered unavoidable in the present state of medical knowledge. The major event of the year has been the retirement in March of Dr. J. S. Lloyd, who was Medical Officer of Health for Hayes and Harhngton for twenty-seven years. It is not easy to follow an officer of such old standing, and I would like to record here my thanks to the members of the Council, my colleagues, and especially the staff of the Public Health Department, for the kind welcome and generous assistance which they have given me. It is impossible in the short space of this foreword to cover all aspects of the Public Health Service, but I propose to deal briefly with one subject in each report. This year I would like to stress the importance of clean food handling and hygiene. Although no serious outbreak of dysentery or food poisoning occurred, the number of suspected cases notified suggests a potential source of trouble. An instance of this occurred recently in a borough in the north, where pork pies were infected by gravy handled by a worker suffering from dysentery. Over one hundred cases were notified, and at least two deaths occurred, one being a local doctor. In addition, the financial loss to the firm concerned was estimated at about £5,000—and all this because one person failed to follow the elementary rules of personal hygiene. 2 In this district the Public Health Department carries out constant supervision of shops and other premises where food is handled. Much is voluntarily surrendered as unfit for human consumption, advice is proffered (and taken) regarding precautions necessary, facilities available, and so on, to reduce the risk of contamination of food by undesirable material. In addition, talks and lectures are given to firms and interested organisations on the risks attached to handling of food, and the ways in which these risks may be avoided. The absence of a major outbreak should not be a matter for complacency but only thankfulness, and constant attention should be given to the matter by everyone, whether or not they are actually engaged in handling food. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (Census 1951—Preliminary Report) 65,608 Population (mid-year 1953—Registrar General's estimate of civilian population) 65,080 Number of inhabited houses as at 31st December, 1953 17,737 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1953 £449,559 Product of a penny rate £1,786 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births: M.

Hospitals. Hayes Cottage Hospital, Grange Road, Hayes. Harlington Cottage Hospital, Sipson Lane, Harlington, for maternity cases. Hillingdon Hospital, near Uxbridge. St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, for infectious diseases. Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford, for cases of smallpox. Ambulance Service. Motor ambulances are provided by the Middlesex County Council for the conveyance of all cases to hospital. Tuberculosis. Provision is made by the Middlesex County Council for treating cases of tuberculosis at South Mimms Hospital, Harefield Hospital, and other places. The Chest Clinic is situated at the Local County Offices, High Street, Uxbridge. Child Welfare Clinics, etc. There are numerous Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics in the district ; these are administered by the Middlesex County Council and the services provided are available free of charge. Sessions are held in clinic buildings, certain church halls, and during this year a mobile clinic has visited weekly some districts which are a long way from established clinics. Immunisation. Immunisation against diphtheria and whooping cough, and vaccination of infants against smallpox are available without cost at the County Council's clinics. Most parents gladly take advantage of the facilities offered, but there still remain a section who, for various reasons, deny their children protection against these diseases. Although there have been few cases of diphtheria in the country for some years, the danger still exists and it would be foolish to ignore it. School Health Service. This is provided by the Middlesex County Council; it comprises treatment of minor ailments, dental services, and periodic medical examinations on entry into school, during the last year in junior school, and during the last year in senior school. 7 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES Tuberculosis There has been little change in the incidence of this disease, although the death rate has fallen slightly. It is less easy to give accurate figures here, since the cessation of the compulsory keeping of registers. Poliomyelitis In spite of a small epidemic in part of the country, only seven cases of poliomyelitis were notified in this district; there were no deaths, and only four cases were of the paralytic variety. Scabies Scabies is no longer a notifiable disease. A few cases occur and these are treated by the family doctor, or sometimes by the School Health Services. WATER SUPPLY An abundant supply of water is available in the district; the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company supply the greater part of the district, while a small area at the southern extremity of the district is supplied by the South Western Suburban Water Company. Twenty-nine dwelling houses, representing 00.16% of the total dwellings and population in the district, are supplied from standpipes and one from a well; all other dwellings have piped supplies from the Companies' mains. Chemical and bacteriological examinations of the water have been made by the Clinical Research Association, and the Public Health Laboratory Service at Ealing. The number of samples taken for bacteriological examination was as follows :— Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company 13 South West Suburban Water Company 5 Private Wells 6 Satisfactory results were obtained from all these samples, indicating that the quality of the water in the district is consistently good. Ten samples of water from mobile canteens operating in the district were also found to be satisfactory. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF COUNCIL STAFF The total number of examinations carried out during 1953 was 141. Of these 61 were for superannuation purposes, 64 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme and 16 for various special purposes. 8 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS) DURING THE YEAR 1953 Disease Total Confirmed Cases Notified Total Deaths Scarlet Fever 84 - Diphtheria — — Pneumonia 101 32 Meningococcal Infection 2 — Puerperal pyrexia 12 — Erysipelas 7 — Ophthalmia neonatorum — — Measles 938 1 Whooping Cough 257 — Dysentery 1 — Acute poliomyelitis and encephalitis 7 — Malaria 1 — Para-typhoid fever — — Food poisoning — — Smallpox - — Acute encephalitis lethargica - - TUBERCULOSIS New cases and mortality during the year 1953.

Five summonses were taken out for failure to comply with Abatement Notices and in each case the requirements of the Notice were carried out before the hearing took place. The summonses were therefore withdrawn on payment of costs. (b) Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Proceedings were taken on four occasions in connection with foreign matter in food. A conviction was secured in every case and fines varying from £2 to £5. 5. Od., together with costs, were imposed by the Magistrates. (c) Middlesex County Council Acts, 1944-1950. Successful action was taken against the owner of an unauthorised caravan site. A fine of £5 with £3. 3. Od. costs was imposed and the site was subsequently cleared of caravans. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS No decrease in the number of caravans in the district has taken place since the last report and at the end of the year approximately 120 were in use for permanent habitation. As indicated in a previous section of this report, successful proceedings were taken against the owner of an unauthorised site and the site was subsequently cleared. Apart from the abatement of the housing shortage, which does not appear to be in sight, there does not seem to be any solution to the caravan problem other than the provision of properly equipped municipal sites to replace the ill-equipped and badly-run private sites. The Minister's approval has been obtained for the Compulsory Purchase of land at Harlington for a site and it is hoped that next year it will be possible to report that the site is in operation. Once again the district has enjoyed comparative freedom from gypsies thereby avoiding the waste of Sanitary Inspectors' time which occurs when these people are constant visitors. There does not seem to be any reason why this district should have an immunity not shared by other Local Authorities in this area other than the policy of enforcing the provisions of the Middlesex County Council Acts against itinerant caravan dwellers immediately they are found in the district. OFFENSIVE TRADES There is no establishment in the district carrying on an Offensive Trade. 13 PREVENTION OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION As a result of the disastrous London fog in December, 1952, this subject has been well to the fore during the year under report. There has been a noticeable increase in public interest and conditions which were, until recently, accepted without comment are now made the subject of complaint. Contact has been maintained with womens' organisations and other local bodies in an effort to stimulate this interest and to focus attention on the part played in air pollution by domestic fires. The sale of grates capable of burning smokeless fuels has continued at a high level and all Council houses built during the year have been equipped with this type of grate. If the public could be induced to burn nothing but smokeless fuels in these grates a considerable improvement in the state of the atmosphere would result. A deterrent to the increased use of smokeless fuels is their high cost particularly those which are produced by low temperature carbonisation. This is a matter which should receive attention in the highest quarters if the smoke abatement movement is to make further progress. Local industry has been very co-operative and it has not been necessary to take any proceedings for contravention of the Smoke Byelaws i.e. the emission of black smoke for more than two minutes in a half-hour period. At the end of the year one firm which has, in the past, received a lot of attention from the Sanitary Inspectors was installing an additional boiler to avoid the over-loading (with consequent smoke production) of the existing plant which sometimes occurs. One stand at the Hygiene Exhibition, described elsewhere in this report, was set out with exhibits loaned from the National Smoke Abatement Society, and proved to be of considerable interest. DRAINAGE At the end of the year there were seventy-one pail closets and seventy-six cesspools in the district. Action under Section 47 of the Public Health Act for the replacement of pail closets by water closets is practicable in only twelve cases and these will be dealt with as soon as possible. Similarly, everything possible will be done to bring about the abolition of the twenty-two cesspools which are situated within a reasonable distance of a public sewer. As some of them are in good condition and do not give rise to any nuisance it is a matter for persuasion rather than compulsion. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer & Surveyor's Department. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge has been continued and no snags or difficulties have arisen in connection with this work. The advantages, however, are, from the public health point of view, incalculable. The service of large numbers of notices is avoided, and, of more importance, serious nuisances are abated within an hour or two of being reported instead of continuing, pending the expiry of the time limit of a Statutory Notice. 14 THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 There are one hundred and thirty eight factories with mechanical power and eight factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including :— Aircraft, building materials, caravans, carbon products, cheese, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, electrical transformers, furniture, lubricating oil, optical lenses, potato crisps, pianos, radio, radar, television, gramophone records and gramophones, rubber, tarmacadam and wood block floors.

Fifty-three notifications have been received and eighty-nine inspections made ; in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. 15 HOUSING During the year 1953 the following houses were completed by the Council and private developers : Post-war total to 1953 31/12/53 Permanent houses 238 1,541 Temporary bungalows — 224 Houses rebuilt after destruction by enemy action — 69 Houses rendered habitable after serious damage by enemy action — 3 Adaptation of unoccupied buildings1 11 1.—Inspection of houses during the year: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 784 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 2,852 (2) (a) Number of dwelling houses which were spected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 and 1932 363 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 407 (3) Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 114 (4) Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 322 2.—Remedy of defects, etc., during the year without the service of Formal Notices : (a) Number of dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers 263 (b) Number of dwellings in respect of which voluntary undertakings not to re-let on termination of present tenancy were given 3 (c) Number of dwellings closed in pursuance of voluntary undertakings 6 3.—Action under Statutory Powers during the year : (1) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936 : (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs (b) Number of dwelling houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices : (i) By owners — (ii) By Local Authority in default of owners — 16 (2) Proceedings under Public Health Act, 1936 : (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 50 (b) Number of dwelling houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices : (i) By owners 42 (ii) By Local Authority in default of owners — (iii) Partly complied with but not yet complete — (3) Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936: (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made or Undertakings given — (b) Number of dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders — (4) Proceedings under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936: (a) Number of separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were made — (b) Number of separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were determined, the tenement or room having been rendered fit — OVERCROWDING Fifty cases of overcrowding were abated during the year and thirty-one new cases were discovered making a net decrease of nineteen in the number of cases still to be dealt with. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (a) Milk Supply : A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the register are : Milk Distributors 21 Dairies 10 The following licences have been issued : Designation Dealer's Licence Supplementary Licence Tuberculin Tested 10 10 Pasteurised 11 10 Sterilised 14 12 17 An Order made under Section 23 of the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is in force. During the year seventy-five samples of milk were taken for bacteriological examination; all but three passed the Statutory tests, i.e. the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase tests. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. (b) Ice Cream. One hundred and nine persons are registered for the sale of ice cream in the district, including eleven who are registered for its manufacture. All the latter use methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations. In sampling, emphasis has been placed on our own manufacturers and on unwrapped ice cream brought into the district from other areas. Seventy-six samples were taken and graded as follows : Grade I 73 or 96.1% Grade II 3 or 3.9% Grade III 0 or 0.0% Grade IV 0 or 0.0 % 76 100.0% Thirty-two samples of water ices and ice lollies were taken, of which two were reported to be unsatisfactory. It is pleasing to note that the efforts of the Sanitary Inspectors, following the large percentage of unsatisfactory samples reported last year, has brought about such an improvement. (c) The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. There is no Ministry of Food slaughterhouse in the district, but the inspection of meat and other food in butchers' shops, grocers and provision dealers, cafes and canteens, forms one of the Sanitary Inspectors' most important duties. During the year 1,870 lbs. of meat and 1,352 lbs. of canned meat were condemned. During the year thirty-five pigs were slaughtered under licence or in emergency. All were examined and found to be free from tuberculosis. In two instances the lungs were affected with pneumonia and were condemned; in another instance a carcase and its offal were condemned on account of being affected with swine fever. 18 The following foods (other than meat) were also condemned during the year : Biscuits 113 lbs. Fruit (Tinned) 682 tins Cereals 65 lbs. Milk and Cream 150 tins Confectionery ... 321 lbs. Preserves 26 jars Cheese Spread ... 25 lbs. /tins Eggs (shell) 136 doz. Rabbits 65 lbs. Eggs (tinned) 482 lbs. Sausages (tinned) 189 lbs. Fish 56 lbs. Tomato Puree 189J cwt. Fish (tinned) 62 tins Vegetables (tinned) 483 tins Frozen Foods 39 pkts. Whale Meat 44 lbs. Pitnientos 62 cwts. Miscellaneous tinned Salad Cream etc. 414 lbs. food 242 tins Other Miscellaneous food 15 lbs. Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers or in accordance with the Salvaged Goods (Revocation) Order, 1953. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried on the Council's refuse tip. Miscellaneous foods such as shell-fish, cream cakes, watercress and meat products are regularly sampled for bacteriological examination and the results are of considerable assistance to the Sanitary Inspectors in their contacts with food-handlers, illustrating, as they often do, that the greatest care is necessary in the storage and handling of this class of food. (d) Meat Transport. No improvement has taken place in the conditions under which meat is transported from the wholesale depots to butchers' shops and in view of the impending decontrol of meat supplies it is unlikely that the organisation at present responsible for this task will commit itself to any improvement scheme involving appreciable expense until the future is more clear. Under these conditions it is the object of the Sanitary Inspectors to prevent, by constant supervision, the gross mispractices to which these conditions have, in the past, given rise. (e) Food Handling Byelaws. Byelaws made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950, and have been of great help in bringing about the considerable improvement in food hygiene standards which has taken place since that time. The protection given to food to prevent contamination is greater than ever before, particularly food displayed for sale on shop counters and therefore especially liable to contamination by handling coughing or sneezing. (/) Clean Food Campaign. At the end of the year there were 104 members in the Food Hygiene Guild, representing one-third of the food traders in the district and an increase of 14 over last year's total. The Guild's Certificates, membership plaques and lapel badges supplied to shop assistants have become familiar sights in the town and are a constant reminder, both to the shopping public and those engaged in the handling of food, of the importance of food hygiene. 19 The Hygiene Exhibition held in conjunction with the Town Fete on the 6th June was sponsored by the Food Hygiene Guild. In previous years it has been disappointing to report very small attendances at public meetings and film shows arranged in support of the food hygiene campaign. It is therefore very pleasant to report that this exhibition, a "one-day stand" held in a large marquee in the Town Hall Park, was an outstanding success. The official estimate of the number of people at the Fete was 50,000 and it is conservatively estimated that 15,000 passed through the Hygiene Exhibition. The exhibits dealt with Clean Milk, Rodent Control, Insect Control, Food Hygiene, and the Inspection and Sampling of Food. Films were shown throughout the day. During the year food hygiene propaganda posters, obtained from the Central Council for Health Education, have been posted on the Council's notice boards in all parts of the district and changed at regular intervals. (g) Clean Food Handbook. During the year the production of a Clean Food Handbook was sponsored by the Food Hygiene Guild. The handbook was well printed on art paper and was produced by a firm of commercial advertising agents at no cost to the Guild. The handbook described the sources and spread of food poisoning and gave advice on the correct methods of handling, preparing and storing foodstuffs. Three thousand copies were printed and distributed to the general public through Guild Members. (.h) Sampling of Food and Drugs. The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer : 339 samples were taken, including 199 of milk ; 19 (12 of which were milk) were found to be unsatisfactory. Successful proceedings were taken in one instance, the other cases being dealt with by cautions to the traders concerned. (*) Food Poisoning. There was no case of food poisonine notified during the vear. (;') Inspection of Food Premises. (a) Inspections: Total number in District Inspections Made Premises Restaurants and Cafes 47 719 Ice cream dealers and manuficturers 109 470 Licensed premises 32 174 Dairies and milk distributors' premises 31 71 Preserved food premises 51 112 Bakehouses 9 194 Butchers' shops 31 485 Grocers' shops 69 736 Fish shops 15 129 Greengrocers' shops 30 331 Food hawkers' premises 39 50 Mobile canteens 5 21 20 (b) Defects remedied: Total Cleanliness improved 185 Structural repairs 56 Lighting improved 7 Ventilation improved 5 Equipment improved 27 Hot water supplies improved 12 Clean towels provided 42 Food storage accommodation improved 47 Rodent infestation abated 19 Other improvements 13 KEEPING OF ANIMALS During the year the Council agreed to make byelaws to contro 1 the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle. Premises in which these animals are kept have often given rise to nuisances particularly in the Harlington and Yeading areas. The byelaws deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of these premises, the storage of manure, drainage, boiling of swill etc. and should be of considerable assistance to the Sanitary Inspectors in their efforts to minimize nuisances from offensive smells and flies. No objections were received following publication of the Council's intention to make the byelaws and at the end of the year they were awaiting confirmation by the Minister. RODENT CONTROL Two whole-time rodent operators are employed. Treatment is carried out in accordance with the methods suggested by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. A charge to cover labour and cost of materials is made for work done in business premises but all treatment at dwelling houses is free. During the year 575 dwelling houses and 269 business premises were treated and also many ditches, undeveloped sites, etc. The use of "Warfarin" as a poison has been continued on an increased scale and its value as an alternative to the older poisons fully confirmed. SHOPS ACTS All parts of the Shops Acts are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half-holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants, etc. The Sanitary Inspectors made 2,928 visits for this purpose during the year, including 1,748 which were made outside normal office hours, i.e. in the evenings and on Sundays. 21 Perry & Routleff Ltd., Pri nters, Uxbridge and Ealing
