WILKINSON, M.D., &c, Medical Officer of Health for the District. ???ENTLEMEN, ???In accordancc with the provisions of the Metropolis ???anagrmcnt Amendment Act, 1862, which requires an ???inual report to be published, I lay before you the report of ???e sanitary state of the Lewisham District during the year ???870. ???Table I. contains the enumerated population in 1851 and The estimated population calculated logarithmally. The estimated population calculated by ascertaining the number of inhabited houses from the rate-book, and calcu???ting the number per house at the last census (1861). The number of inhabited houses at the middle of 1870. The average number of persons per house in 1851. The average number of persons per house in 1861. The average mortality per 1000, assuming a population ???tained from the number per house in 1861, and the number ??? inhabited houses in 1870. Including the Metropolis, the 20 great cities of the kingdom, with an estimated population of 7,216,325 souls, stand on 333¼ square miles. In these, 182,819 persons died and ???159,910 children were born. The birth rate was 36 0; the ???death rate 25.3 per 1000 in the year. The mortality of 70 cities of the kingdom was at the rate of 24. 9 per 1000. 6 The mortality of the rest of the kingdom \vn9 at the rate of 221 per 1000. The estimated population of London is 3,214,707. (The population within the police area extending over a circle. having Charing Cross as its centre, and a radius of 10 miles, is estimated 3,753,763.) The mortality of London during the year 1870 was 77,278; of these, 18,001 died under the age of 1 year. The mean death rate is 24.34, and the mortality in 1870 is a little below this, being 2 1.12. The mortality of the west and north districts rose above the average in 1870. The effect of the drainage of the low south district reduced the mortality in the three decenniads since 1840 in the following progressive improvement, viz., 20.6, 24.4, 23.2.—(Registrar General's Report.) The estimated population of the Lewisham District in the middle of the year 1870 amounted to 47,422. TABLE I. Enumerated Population, 1851. Enumerated Population, 1861.

The death rate was 10.99 per 1000. These rates differed in the different Registrar's subdistrict Thus: In Blackheath (so much as is contained in Lewisham Parish), The birth rate was 24.64 per 1000. The death rate was 10.47 per 1000. In Lewisham Village (Registrar's district), The birth rate was 38.12 per 1000. The death rate was 21.28 per 1000. In Sydenham (Registrar's district), The birth rate was 36.09 per 1000. The death rate was 13.80 per 1000. In penge, The birth rate was 28.18 per 1000. The death rate was 12.28 per 1000.

The prevalent epidemics were Scarlet Fever, which destroyed 70 lives, and Diarrhoea, of which an unusually large number (48) died. PERRY VALE DRAINAGE. In several of my monthly reports I drew the attention of the Board to the fact that fatal epidemic disease was pervalent in two limited localities near Forest Hill Station, viz.:— 10 Dartmouth Park and Perry Vale, and that this disease was caused by the want of proper drainage in these neighbourhoods, by unventilated cesspools, old brick drains without ventilation, and want of attention to sanitary requirements. These requirements were remedied by the construction of the Perry Vale sewer, which runs through the neighbourhood indicated, and into which I believe that the houses in that locality arc all now drained. The absolute want of drainage of the houses at Westwood Park, Forest Hill, on tho border of the Parish, was also brought under your notice, but as these houses were in Camberwell Parish, they were not under the control of the Lewisham Board. Cesspools have since been constructed, but it remains for the Local authority to ventilate such cesspools, to prevent such overflow as gives rise to nuisance, to provide for cleansing at proper intervals, and to abate any existing nuisance in ditches. An official enquiry was also made by order of the Privy Council, of these localities, but the sewer in Perry Vale was already in progress when this enquiry was instituted. 1 WATER SUPPLY. This district is dependent upon two companies for its water supply, viz., the Lambeth and the Kent Companies, the former supplying Sydenham and Penge, and the latter Lewisham and Blackheath. Dr. Frankland, in his report upon water supply, states that the Lambeth Company requires to make considerable improvement in its subsidence and filtration plant.The water of the Kent Company (which is now wholly derived from chalk wells), is not filtered before delivery ; the natural filtration which the water receives through the pores of the chalk is very greatly superior to the best artificial operation of this kind. The supply is still of an intermittent kind, but I think that the time must shortly come when the inconvenience and danger arising from this plan will no longer be tolerated 11 In conclusion, it would be as well to call attention to sonic remarks in my reports of last and previous years upon the subject of the necessity for disinfecting bedding and wearing apparel after being used by those labouring under infectious disease, and some general remarks upon house drainage and ventilation of drains. No public disinfecting apparatus exists in the district. This is much needed, as disease is fostered and spread from infected bedding and clothing. And also to the important subject: That the drainage of houses should be as much as possible external to them; that the soil pipe from water-closets should be outside buildings; that the pipes from sinks, &c., should be never allowed to enter a drain; and that the overflow pipes from cisterns sould never be connected with a watercloset or drain. Added to which, that every drain should be provided with I a ventilating pipe of sufficient height to carry off foul gas I out of reach, and to prevent the possibility of sewer air Iforcing itself into houses especially at night when houses are closed. That it would bo well if the public generally would use carbolic acid more extensively in private houses, for drains IMnd closets; as its general use would prevent putrefactive decomposition, and render the atmosphere of drains and sewers much more wholesome. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. EACIIUS WILKINSON. 12 TABLE V.—DEATHS DURING THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE YEAR 1870. CLASSES OF DISEASE. CAUSES OF DEATH. AGES AT DEATH.

Gentlemen, I beg to report upon the works curried out by me during the preceding year. Sewers have been constructed by tho Board in the following localities, viz.: Westbourne and 1,000ft. 15in, pipe 196 14 1 Chaplin Street 131 ft. I1in. „ Hither Green Lane 210ft. 12in. „ 28 8 2 Anerley Road Croydon and Elmers End Road 982ft. 12in. „ 134 6 11 £359 9 2 The Terry Yule Sewer, commenced last year, was finished and all the houses capable of being connected have been drained into the same; this much needed Sewer has been of great benefit, and rendered the drainage of the surrounding locality complete. VENTILATION, &c. Great attention has been given during the past year to the Ventilation of Sewers, and a considerable number of Charcoal Ventilators have been fixed to the existing air shafts from the Sewers which are periodically inspected by me, care being taken to supply the same with fresh charcoal as often as required. Gullies out of order have been repaired, and a number of new ones have been built. Four men are constantly employed in flushing and cleansing Sewers throughout the year under my superintendence. 15 SANITARY WORK. To remedy a long standing nuisance three Urinals have been erected in Lewisham Village, at a total cost of £115. The River Quaggy was cleansed, and the bottom con???reted at a cost of £ 55 18s. 6d. The following tabular f nn show- the number of Notices reserved by the Inspector of Nuisances, Mr. Robertson, during the past year, all of which have been complied with. To drain. To cleanse drains. To compel Water supply. To abate Nuisances. 288 20 80 61 Complaints having been made of Sewerage from the vCroydon District flowing into the Hamlet of Penge, and upon the same being represented the Croydon Board agreed to defray the cost of a temporary drain, which was contructed by this Board, until the Croydon Board had completed their System of drainage in that locality. I am, Your obedient Servant, W. H. TREVERTON. HOUSE DRAINAGE. 205 applications have been received and granted, coinarising tlie buildings and drainage of 324 houses, in most cases alrteady executed. 150 houses permanently drained, and 22 temporarily drained into cesspools. REPORT OF SURVEYOR OF HIGHWAYS Of Works executed from Lady-day, 1870, to Lady-day, 1871. Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to present ray second annual report upon the works carried out in my department during the past year. The total cost of the Highways in the Parish of Lewisham, for labour, cartage, material, &c., was £6,169 10s. 3d., including the sum of £1,982 4s. 0d., the expense of the former New Cross Roads, and £881 19s. 0d. cost of laying Tar paving. The total expenses of the Highways in Penge during the year was £1,459 1s. 9d., for cartage, labour, and material. The sum of £272 10s. 6d. lor laying Tar Pavement is included in the above sum. I have no hesitation in saying that the roads generally in the District have improved during the past year. They are in better form, and several additional gullies have been put in. It will, however, take some time (without a large increase of expenditure) to bring them up to the standard I should like to see them at. The roads that require the most attention are Stan stead Lane and Brockley Lane. In fact these roads have never been properly made, and it is not many years since they were mere tracts. Now they are two important thoroughfares. I am anxious to substitute a better material for the maintenance of some of the roads than flint and gravel—flint and gravel being too absorbent—but as it would involve a large outlay to do them at once, I recommend that they may be done gradually. The Steam Roller was used for the first time in this Parish in November and December, and was employed in 17 Boiling the former New Cross Roads. I consider that its use would be found very beneficial, for it consolidates the metal it once upon the roads, and ensures an uniform surface which most desirable. Two of Smith's Patent Sweeping Machines, purchased by your Board have been used with the greatest advantage, and I hope next year to have a larger number of slop carts, and avoid delay as much as possible in clearing the streets of mud. WATERING. Most of the Watering in Lewisham and Blackheath Village was done by the Board's men and horses; the atering in Sydenham and Forest Hill, &c., at a contract price of 8s. 3d. per horse and man; and in the Hamlet of Penge, 7s. per man and horse.

I also drew plans, &c., for the widening of a portion of Brockley Lane to a width of 50 feet, and the proceedings for the possesion of the land are progressing favorably.
