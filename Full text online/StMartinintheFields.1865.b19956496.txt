In conformity with the 198th Section of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the following Report of the affairs and business of the Vestry during the past year, accompanied by an Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure, duly audited as required by the Act, is shown. Vestry Meetings and Committees. The Return attached to this Report will show that the Vestry has held 30 meetings, and the Committees appointed by the Vestry have held 44 meetings during the year. Leicester Square. Since my last Report an Action has been brought 6 against the Metropolitan Board of Works, by the Freeholders of the vacant space in the centre of Leicester Square, to try the right of the Board to take possession under the Gardens in Towns Act. The cause has been turned into a Special Case. If the decision should be against the Board by reason of any defects in the Act, it has been intimated that an application will be made to Parliament to amend the Act, in order to preserve the Square as an open space. Railway and other Companies. Three Bills having been brought into the House of Commons during the 'present Session, one for giving new powers to the Equitable Gas Light Company; another, for making New Approaches through the Parish to the Thames Embankment; and a third, for giving objectionable powers to the Pneumatic Despatch Company, the Vestry petitioned against such Bills, and I was instructed to support those Petitions. Sanitaey Measures. The Medical Officer's Report is attached, showing the sanitary state of the Parish, and the steps taken to improve it during the past year. In connection therewith the Vestry have caused 92 notices for abatement of nuisances to be served during the past year, and 19 summonses have been issued to compel the inhabitants to abate the nuisances complained of. In all the other cases the notices have been complied with. Sueveyoes Repoet. Under this head, all the works done under the direction of the Vestry will appear. 7 Conclusion. Bound up with the Annual Report will be found a detailed account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the rents and dividends belonging to the Alms Fund in this parish devoted to charitable purposes, and distributed by the Churchwardens in the support of Alms "Women and Out-Pensioners elected by the Vestry.

Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields for the Year 1865. In the year 1865, there have been 579 births and 597 deaths. Of children under five years there have been 227 deaths, and persons over sixty years 106. From epidemic diseases there have been 99 deaths; the most fatal of these diseases has been whooping cough. The house-to-house visitation has been of considerable service in the discovery of many nuisances, which might have remained unnoticed for years, and it would have been more useful but for the unfortunate illness of the appointed Inspector, who was obliged to go into King's College Hospital, where he died. However, we obtained a very long list of houses requiring cleansing, whitewashing, and many repairs to closets, cellars, dustbins, &c., most of which have been carried out. The defective state of the drainage, &c., of houses can only be fully made known to Inspectors and Officers of Health by information obtained from the occupants themselves: a mere inspection of the premises does not give us sufficient knowledge of defective drains, unless the occupants call attention to them from their own experience. There were but few instances of positive refusal to permit the Inspector to see premises, 16 or to give him information about them, and these were mostly in cases where probably 110 defects existed; but we find, here and there, a certain mental temperament which objects generally to anything like official or governmental inquiry into what are considered private matters. But of course this is a great mistake in our case, because individual as well as the public health is the object of our inspections. Some knowledge of the nature of the various causes having influence on the general health has removed, in most people, all objections to sanitary inspections and inquiries; and increasing information on the subject, will bring to the knowledge of all, that preventive medicine is of more importance than curative medicine. I have always considered my appointment as Officer of Health, one of the happiest circumstances of my professional life. Having always thought that the great object of medical science was rather the prevention than the cure of disease, I cannot but feel gratified in having duties to perform, the true objects of which are prevention of disease, and the propagation of those laws upon which the public health, as well as that of individuals, is to be maintained. It is the duty of Officers of Health to direct attention to the means of maintaining health, but individual efforts are also necessary for the full success of such means. It is the duty of all, and more especially of the heads of families, to make themselves acquainted with the more important conditions on which health may be improved and maintained. Plenty of fresh air, cleanliness of house and person, moderation in eating and drinking, proper ventilation of rooms and houses, and a fair amount of exercise in the open air, are among the primary laws of health. The most frequentlyneglected of these laws is the ventilation of rooms; I grant the difficulty where father, mother, and children all sleep in one room. In a room thus occupied, the 17 air become almost poisonous before half the night has elapsed. Those who enter such a room, even an hour or two after the family have risen, find it difficult to breathe the atmosphere; the occupants themselves do not perceive the condition of the air, but anyone who may, iu the early morning, have occasion to enter it, is warned of the danger of going in, and stops at the threshold. This condition of the air of rooms so occupied is the principal cause of that great mortality of the children in such houses 011 the occurrence of any epidemic disease. Such a complaint as measles or whooping cough, in closely crowdcd rooms, is very fatal among the children who live in them, while among the classes who arc better lodged such diseases of children are infinitely less fatal. The proportion of deaths of children in places so crowded, ranges from one-third and sometimes to one-half of the total number. Some portion of this excessive mortality would be prevented by having the upper sash of the window always open for about an inch. As soon as possible in the morning children should be enabled to breathe the open air, the air even of a London street or court is very much more healthful than that of the house. It is impossible to have healthy children if they are kept in the house for days together; the result of breathing the impure atmosphere of a crowded house or room is that low condition of health which makes children incapable of resisting attacks of disease, and will account for the large number who are carried off by the first epidemic disease to which they are subjected. I am happy to be able to report that the sewers ordered by the Vestry to be cleansed and repaired in Mercer Street, the Strand, Oxendon Street, and Chandos Street, no longer give out from the gullyholes and ventilating shafts those offensive odours of which the inhabitants complained. There is no doubt, that emanations from sewers and drains are most important c 18 agents in the propagation of infectious diseases. In the case of Mercer Street especially, I may mention that the removal of the blind extremity of the drain, by its extension into the Long Acre sewer, has entirely removed the smell complained of, and there has been less illness in the neighbouring houses since the improvement was effected. In Table No. 1, I have given the numbers of the births and deaths for the last ten years: the totals of the first five years exceed those of the five last; the births being; less in the five last years by 129, and the deaths by 63. There have been more deaths from smallpox this year than in any of the ten except 1863. Smallpox has been increasing for many months. I am happy to say a Bill has been read a second time by the House of Commons, the object of which is to promote the practice of vaccination. It is the sad neglect of vaccination that still keeps so dreadful a disease as smallpox among our population. Whooping cough has again this year been the most fatal of zymotic diseases. Typhus fever has hardly exceeded the average, but in addition to the 19 deaths recorded from this disease, 10 of our parishioners died in the Fever Hospital. Deaths from consumption rather exceeded the average, while those from other diseases of the breathing organs, show the smallest number of the whole ten years. The annual death rate, 24. per 1000 inhabitants, was rather below the average, and would be more if we excluded those deaths which may be said accidentally only to belong to our district, viz., those of persons found drowned in St. James's Park, and that part of the River Thames abutting on the parish; the newly-born children found in the Green and St. James's Parks, and the deaths of persons in our numerous lodging-houses who come up to London for medical advice, &c. The aggregate of these amount to more than 1 per thousand, and our death rate would be 23 instead of; 24. 19 Tables 2 and 3 arc interesting as exhibiting the much greater mortality in the Long Acre over the Charing Cross district, the gross population of each not being very different. In the Long Acre district we have Bedfordbury and its densely populated courts: the total number of deaths in the Long Acre division, exceed those of the Charing Cross division by 50: of children under live years of age there is an excess of 35: while of deaths from epidemic diseases the number is more than double that of Charing Cross district, being 51 to 21. It is impossible to have a more marked example of the differing death-rates in the differing classes of society. The outbreak of cholera in the east of London must bring to the minds of all thoughtful persons the present degraded aud abject condition of multitudes of the poorer classes of our population, both in large commercial towns and in those of agricultural districts, and too often in the remotest villages the poverty of our population is almost equally distressing. Those who witnessed the crowds assembled to greet Garibaldi on his entrance into London were struck with the ragged, dirty, and poverty-stricken appearance of the vast crowds assembled on the occasion. That the wealthy City of Loudon could have exhibited such a mass of poverty and wretchedness must have struck foreigners with surprise. Fifty years ago the same remarks have been made in our populous towns : at that time the long continued war was iooked to as the cause, together with the want of education of the masses of our people, and the introduction of general education was hailed as a means of improving the condition of our people both socially and morally. Unhappily we who have seen the extension of education to all classes, do not witness that improvement in their social condition we had hoped for. In London the increase of rent absorbs so much c2 20 of the wages of the working classes, that a small increase of wages will not meet their increased expenses; while the large class of poor women who have to get their living and often to support children also, have constantly increasing difficulties to deal with, more especially as regards the rent of lodgings. This appears to me a point on which the poorer classes have a just claim on the assistance of those families whose fortunes have been made by success in manufactures and commerce. The large demand for land in London and other commercial towns, has absorbed so much, and so raised its value, that it is difficult to find any on which houses for the working classes can be built, and has tended greatly to increase the rents they pay. Some may live short distances from London, but multitudes are obliged to reside near their work, and must consequently pay large rents in proportion to their income, so that they have a claim for assistance in this respect on those who have been successful in their manufacturing and commercial speculations. While much unmerited poverty is the unquestionable cause of a higher death-rate among the working part of our community, yet there are other causes which tend to increase that low condition of health which weakens the constitution and renders health so feeble as to prepare many victims for the first epidemic disease that may prevail. The bad air of unventilated rooms is increased by many habits which are very improper: and I will here mention one which obstructs other improvements in our sanitary arrangements. In almost all houses let out in tenements, the water-closets are unfit for use, and too often the family, and especially the children, never use the closet at all, but a vessel in their only room. This vessel is emptied, possibly once a-day into the closet, and this so carelessly as to render the seat unfit for use, and very often to obstruct the closet altogether, from the various kinds of refuse, &c., 21 which get into the same receptacle. It is not difficult to imagine the state of the atmosphere of a room under such circumstances: at times it is almost pestilential. The general state of the closcts of houses let out to several families, is one of the greatest difficulties in our sanitary endeavours, and I must say that, in this instance, the fault is more with the tenants than with the landlords. The new law 011 the Public Health gives power to oblige landlords to have closets and water supply proportionate to the number of people in a house, but if there were half-a-dozen closets in a house, this indolent habit, to use the mildest invective, would still have to be overcome. Let us hope that the gradual, although very slow influence of advice and common sense, together with better education, will rectify this as well as much other ignorance that prevails on the important subject of Health. That a very low condition of health results from V overcrowding, the pollution of water, too much indulgence in fermented drinks, &c., is unquestionable, but great poverty is also a cause of bad health, and should not be overlooked. Large classes of our population, and specially the innumerable women who are left with children to provide for, arc, in too many instances, desperately poor, and struggle with many difficulties to the very verge of starvation rather than enter the Workhouse. From these circumstances, too little food, and that little too often bad and unwholesome, the healing powers of the constitution are so low as to render very large numbers of our people, more especially children, open to the death inflicting powers of the first epidemic that may assail them, be it typhus fever, cholera, or other infection. Whether anything can be done sufficiently to elevate the mental powers of so dense a population as that of England, is a question I shall not presume to answer. Unless we can improve their physical condition, we 22 shall continue to deplore the little influence in raising the character of our people that has yet resulted from education. Those who have occasion to visit the courts and back streets of the Metropolis, know that there are thousands of children who never receive any education at all, mental, moral, or religious. Without some more vigorous influence to diffuse knowledge among the poorest members of our community, we cannot but fear we have the same fate in prospect which has destroyed civilization in India, China, and other countries from overpeopled ignorant multitudes, whose degradation has drawn down with it that of the whole race, from the highest to the lowest.

Those labouring under sickness or other infirmities, are provided with Nurses at the charge of the Funds. A Chaplain attends at Chapel] on Sunday and Thursday in each week, to perform Divine Service; they are also attended by an eminent Medical Gentleman, and are furnished with Medicine free of charge.—The Out-Pensioners consist of Ten Married Couples, each Couple receiving 30s. per Calendar Month; Twenty Single Persons receive 20s. per Calendar Month each; they have been also Housekeepers in the Parish. The Vestry having found that several applicants for the Alms Fund preferred receiving the Out-Pension and living with their friends, instead of residing in the Alms Houses, have during the last few years, elected the most deserving applicants as Out-Pensioners, by which means the Alms' Fund has been distributed between a larger number of Out-Pensioners than formerly. The number of Pensioners on the Fund in March, 1866, were as follows:—63 Almswomen, 4 Married Couples, and 45 Single Persons—Out-Pensioners. Deed of Gift of Sir Charles Cotterell and Mrs. Susan Grahme. Sir Charles Cotterell, in 1G8G, gave for 8 Alms Women in the Alms Houses on his Foundation £ s. d. 20 0 0 per annum arising from the Manor of Drayton and Westover, in the County of Somerset. and Mrs. Susan Grahiue, in 1686, for 4 Alms Women in the Alms Houses on her Foundation 50 0 0 per annum arising from the same Manor. These sums are paid to those twelve Alms Women monthly, by the Vicar, or his Deputy for the time; being, and who form a part of the 70 Alms Women in the Alms Houses.
