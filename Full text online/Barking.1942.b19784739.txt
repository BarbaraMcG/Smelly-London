BARK F Read BOROUGH OF BARKING. THE ANNUAL REPORT of the SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER. FOR THE YE A R 1942 (War Edition) C. LEONARD WILLIAUS. B.Sc., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., D.P.H. BOROUGH OF BARKING A N N U A L REPORT of the School Medical Officer for the Borough of Barking, in the County of Essex, for the year ended 31st December, 1942. (War Edition). Public Health Department, Barking, Essex. August, 1943 To the Chairman & Members of the Local Education authority. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my report for the year ended 3lst December, 1942, This year is a part of the third year and part of the fourth year of the war and from this standpoint this report, amongst others of a similar nature, will stand out as documents of historic interest and value. First it will show that the services you established before the war have stood the test of war-time conditions, that they were sufficiently well founded to stand the stress of war and at the same time, sufficiently adaptable to meet the chanced conditions brought about by the war. I believe that you will find, as the historians of the future will find, that this report shows that the children of school-age who have lived into the fourth year of this war have maintained their health, their strength and their vitality, that they have not been adversely affected by war-weariness nor by food-rationing. As a matter of fact with the exception of tuberculosis, the increase in which is a matter for disquiet, continued over-leaf. - 2 - the standards "by which the health of the school population can be judged indicate what I believe you will decide is a fortunate and favourable condition of affairs. I use the word "fortunate" advisably because I cannot help feeling that the school-children and indeed the rest of us also, may have fared almost better than we dared to hope and that because this is so, the present favourable situation demands increased vigilance in order that it may be maintained in the years of struggle which lie ahead. In the same way as members of the general public have availed themselves of the Medical Services provided locally, so also this same public (such as the parents of the schoolchildren) have availed themselves of the services which you have so thoughtfully put at their disposal, the more so because the other medical services, such as the large voluntary hospitals have not been so available as heretofore particularly because of the difficulties of travel. If, therefore, for no other reason, this is some justification for the way in which you have maintained your services and I do hope that after the war we shall have less of the indiscriminate wandering to and fro in search of something new in the way of treatment, and that more and more of the necessary medical treatment which can be undertaken locally will be undertaken locally. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, - 3 - Medical Officer of Health. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER, for the YEAR 1942. (War Edition). (1) STAFF. The following indicates the changes that have taken place in the Staff daring the year 1942. MEDICAL STAFF. Dr. Violet Spiller - Deputy Medical Officer of Health. (Temporary). (Resigned 15.7.42. ) Dr. C.J. de Vcre Shortt - Deputy Medical Officer of Health. (Temporary - Commenced 23.9.42). DENTAL SURGEONS. W.H. Foy - Senior Dental Surgeon - Deceased 2.11.42. J. Angelman - Assistant Dental Surgeon - Service in H.r. For cos from 4.3.42. Dr. R. Null - Temporary Assistant Dental Surgeon (Commenced 21.5.42. Resigned 4.12.42). A.F. Smith - Temporary Assistant Dental Surgeon (Commenced 9.11.42). HEALTH VISITORS &c. Miss P.M. Rodwell (Temporary Health Visitor) (Commenced 10. 8.42). Miss P Nicholls - Assistant to Camp Matron at Hydon Heath - Resigned March, 1942. Miss N.M. Jolly (Chiropodist) - Commenced 8.6.42. During the year members of the staff have continued to participate in the Civil Defence Scheme, but for the most part they have been engaged upon their normal duties in connection with the public Health and Medical Services. - 4 - 2. EVACUATION - GOVERNMENT. Under the Government Scheme evacuation ceased towards the latter end of the year and the last party was evacuated from Barking on November 19th, 1942. During the year ended 31st December, 1942, the number examined fell to 70, 8if. 3 Per cent of which number were passed as fit and without defect. The following comparative table shows the decline in the number of evacuation cases dealt with during the year 1942 as against the previous year: 1942. 1941. Number examined and passed fit without defcct. 59 296 Number requiring special consideration and treatment before evacuation. 3 58 Number declared unfit - for various reasons. 8 16 70 370 3. HYGIENE. The general health of all school children in Barking shows no deterioration during the year 1942. Hot meals have continued to be served in all the schools at a small cost, and in certain cases free. An increasing number of children have taken advantage of this service during the year and this has, no doubt, helped considerably in keeping up the standard of nutrition. Owing to the absence of air raids during the year, there was no difficulty experienced regarding shelter conditions. - 5 - 4. FOLLOWING UP. Much valuable work has been done by Health Visitors and School Nurses in this direction and every case. where treatment is offered and not taken advantage of, is followed up in an endeavour to get such treatment carried out. In the period under review School Nurses and Health Visitors paid no less than 4,672 visits to homes against 3,800 in 1941. 5. MEDICAL INSPECTION. During the year 1942, inspections have been carried out at each school. (a) Routine Medical Inspections. Number of Inspections in the prescribed Groups show an increase of 914 over and above that of 1941:â€” 1942. 1941. Entrants. 1,888 1,285 Second Age-group 1,790 927 Third Age-group 1,330 1,041 Total. 5,008 3,253 Number of other Routine Inspections. 4,175 5,016 Grand Total. 9,183 8,269 (b) Other Inspections. Re-inspe ctions. In this category the Special Inspection figure shows an increase of 3,783 children re-inspected over the number in the previous year. 1942. 1941. Number of Special Inspections and Ho-inspections. 21,549 17,766 These mainly consist of children examined in Minor Ailment Clinics to which they were referred following the discovery of defects at School Medical Inspections. - 6 - 6. CONTROL SERIES OF HEIGHTS AND WEIGHTS OF CHILDREN LIVING IN BARKING. The Chief Medical Officer of the Board of Education was again supplied with particulars of the heights and weights of selected children who remained in Barking during the 1940/41 "blitz". The following table summarises the progress maintained "by these children. AVERAGE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT. BOYS. AgeGroup. Number of individual children examined. 1940 1941 1942. Height. Weight. Height.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR TREATMENT. (a) Minor Ailments. Minor Ailment Cliniee have been held daily at the porters Avenue, Greig Hall and Central Clinics. You will observe from the following comparative table that the total number of cases treated at these clinics show an increase of 2,487 over the previous year, the increase being greatest at Porters Avenue. MINOR AIIMENT CLINICS, YEARS 1940, 1941 & 1942.

This service has, during 1942 been carried out entirely at Central Clinic, three sessions being held weekly. During the year 154 sessions were held as compared with 104 in 1941. It will "be noticed in the table below that the work in this Service has increased. TREATMENT OF DEFECTIVE VISION AND SQUINT. (Excluding Minor Eye Defects treated as Minor Ailments).

Mr. F. Courtenay Mason, your Consultant Specialist held 28 sessions at the Central Clinic. No operative sessions were held at Barking Hospital, the treatment of such cases being carried out at Queen Mary's Hospital, King George Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital. There was a slight decrease during the year in the number of children treated for defects of the Nose and Throat. TREATMENT OF DEFECTS OF NOSE AND THROAT. Number of Defects.

The work of this service was considerably interrupted owing largely to the fact that Mr. Angelinan was called to serve with H.M. Forces and later owing to the regrettable death of Mr, Foy, your Senior Dental Officer, whose work was so much appreciated. We were fortunate, however, in being able to obtain the services of other Dental Surgeons especially so in the ease of Captain Angus Smith, who now operates at the Central Clinic. It will be seen that although the dental inspections at school decreased, the actual amount of treatment work carried out at the various clinics compares not unfavourably with previous years. In this connection it night- be added that during the greater part of the year under review, your dental work was carried out at Bifrons Dental Clinic, Manor Dental Clinic and East Street Dental Clinic, but that in October it was found possible to re-open the Central Dental Clinic in Vicarage Drive, Ripple Road, and transfer the work originally carried out at the East Street Clinic to these premises. - 10 - The following table gives a summary of the work done for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1942, together with a comparative table for the years 1940 and 194I.

Mr. A.M. A. Koore continued to be your Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon during 1942, and the work in this department was carried out normally, your Masseuses undertaking considerable treatment, such as Artificial Sunlight, Massage, Exercises and Electrical Treatment.

This service is still available for appropriate cases, but only one case was treated during the year. It is a matter for rejoicing that only one case of ringworm had to be treated throughout the whole year, but instead of moaning that we can relax our vigilanoe, it means that we must actually increase our watchfulness because ringworm when it gets a grip on a school population increases with compound interest. Incidentally it is pleasing to note that it has decreased in the same way. (g) Speech Training. This service was not available Six 1942. (h) Foot Clinic. The Municipal Foot Clinic was held at Central Clinic until October 1942 when it was transferred to East Street. This coincided with the re-opening of the Central Clinic, Ripple Road, for use as a dental clinic. The Foot Clinic was transferred to East Street after being temporarily housed for one week in the Broadway First-Aid Post. A comparative table showing the attend emcee of scholars at the clinic during the past three years is given below. It will be noticed that there is a great increase compared with previous years in the number of school-children treated. 1940. 1941. 1942. Attendance of O.E. S. Scholars. 19 277 436 8. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. (a) Scarlet Faver. During the year 211 school-children were notified as suffering from scarlet fever. The majority of these cases occurred between September and December and during the months of October and November the weekly total averaged 14 cases. During October a slight outbreak occurred and investigations were duly carried out. No school had to be closed for this or any other type of infectious disease. The cases as in the previous year were of a mild type. During the months of October and November, hospital accommodation was taxed to its utmost and great difficulty was experienced in getting children admitted to hospital and it was even necessary to send ease's as far distant as Billericay and Enfield. In November the Ministry of Health agreed to your Council providing a temporary supply of medicine and medical assistance as well as nurses, for the poor inhabitants of the district in cases where hospitalisation could not be provided. - 13 - (b) Whooping Cough. One hundred and four cases of whooping cough in school-children were notified during the year. These cases were spread evenly over the course of the 12 months, and no epidemic was recorded. Whooping Cough can he a disease very difficult to diagnose. Children can have this complaint without "whooping" even once^ and not all cases who "whoop" are definitely suffering from whooping cough. Figures, therefore, must always he looked upon with reserve. (c) Measles. Cases of this disease were notified during the whole year, 661 of which were school-children. This number was spread evenly over the year. The highest incidence of this disease occurred during the months of May and June. (d) Diphtheria. Twenty two cases were notified during the year. With the increased number's of children now being immunised the danger of "this disease amongst school-children will no doubt be diminished. In November a cfenpaign against diphtheria amongst school-children Was started, an& after talks in each school parents were circularised and given an Opportunity to have their children immunised against diphtheria. Up to Dccember 31st, 635 children had been completely immunised and mainly as a result of the campaign 5>069 children had received their first injections. All the children at Hydon Heath Camp have been protected against diphtheria and the final figures proved most satisfactory. Immunisations against scarlet fever and whooping cough as well as diphtheria were carried out regularly at your various clinics. 9Â» SKIN DISEASES. Scabies. The incidence of scabies showed an increase and in March special arrangements were made for out-patient treatment of this complaint. Up to December 31st, 144 children received treatment. Skin Clinic. On Tuesday, 8th December, 1942, a Skin Clinic was opened at the Barking Hospital for thetxeatment of skin cases with one of the Hospital Medical Officers in charge. Owing to the short period of time between the opening of the Clinic and my Report nothing of real value can be recorded except that I fully anticipate the success of the venture. The following shows the number of skin defects treated or under treatment, in respect of elementary scholars:- 1940. 1941. 1942. Ringworm (Scalp). 1 4 6 Ringworm (Body). 11 17 13 Scabies. 135 403 659 Impetigo. 100 191 301 Other Skin Diseases. 155 397 1060 TOTALS. 432 1,012 2,039 - 14 - 10. NUTRITION. For the year ended 31st December, 1942, it may be estimated that there were approximately 10,600 children in your schools, Of these just over 9,000 individual children were examined at school by routine. Your Medical Staff had some 18,000 other.consultations in respect.of schoolchildren. This feature is important for two, reasons:- (a) It shows the completeness of your Service. (b) Arising from this it would appear that you are justified in not holding Special Nutritional Surveys, because not only do your routine examinations cover a very large number of your children, but your special examinations more than likely cover most, if not indeed, all cases which are likely to require investigation from the standpoint of nutrition Talking about nutrition leads me to the results of the ciassification of the 9,000 odd pases which We have specially investigated from this standpoint. Our difficulty is of course, that there are no satisfactory standards of nutrition and only people of long experience have the necessary background to Undertake this work - of course owing to the war much of this work has had to be undertaken by people who have not had .this necessary background. Whilst therefore, it might bp a .matter. for supreme congratulation that none of your children are found to be "bad" so far as nutrition is concerned, I do not think that we should stress this point very much, nor do I stress particularly the fact that no less than 99% of your-children were classified as either "excellent" or "normal". I cannpt help thinking as I did before the war, that the. general standard of development of nutrition in Barking is better than it is in many other places, and that the doctors who have ccme to us from these other places have been guided by their previous experience in nutritional development and have accordingly placed some of the children in a higher category than those of us might who have had. more experience of your.standards in Baricing - 15 - - 16 - Table showing the number of children inspected in the Routine Age-Groups during the years 1940, 1941 and 1942, and the Classification of the Nutrition of such Children.

PROVISION OF SCHOOL MEDICAL SERVICES FOR SECONDARY AND TECHNICAL SCHOLARS II' THE AREA. The Scheme whereby you carry out medical examinations for the Essex County Council in connection with the South East Essex Technical College and the Barlcing Abbey School (which has returned to Barking Area) Is still in force, .and below are the figures for the past two years for the inspection and treatment of pupils in this category. The service is the same as that carried out at your Elementary Schools and includes the Specialist treatment services, - orthopaedic, ophthalmic, dental, ear, nose and throat etc. The increase in the figures over 19l4l is due to the return of Barking Abbey School.

Thirteen sessions of school medical inspection were carried out. 13. UNCLEANLINESS. Systematic examination of children at routine cleanliness inspections has been carried out "by the school nurses throughout the year 1942.

The number of children on the school roll at 31st December, 194l, was 158, but many children returned to Barking during the year 1942 and on 31st December, the number fell to 125. The children who remained in this camp kept in good health and no epidemics or undue ill health was reported. The medical arrangements at the camp continued as during the year 194l. - 18 - The following table shows the amount of work done as compared with the previous year, and additional information as to Dental and Orthopaedic services ia also included:- INSPECTION BY MEDICAL OFFICERS.
