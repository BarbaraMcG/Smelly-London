Electric During the year under report the County of Lighting. London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company have submitted to the Board, under the provisions of the Order of 1892, plans showing the positions of proposed mains and transformer chambers in the district. The Board disapproved of the plans, as they objected to the construction of transformer chambers in the public way and to the number of crossings proposed. The London County Council took the same objection as the Board to the construction of transformer chambers in the public streets, and they also disapproved of the proposed works. The Company appealed to the Board of Trade and agreed to reduce both the number and the dimensions of the transformer chambers, and stated that they were willing to place the chambers in side streets, where that could be conveniently done, and not to cross the streets except at points opposite transformer chambers, or where it might be absolutely necessary. As at first proposed, the transformer chambers would each 14 have occupied a space of about 12-ft. long, 8-ft. wide and 13-ft. deep, besides the entrance, which would be about 1-ft. 6-in by 6-ft. in area. These dimensions were reduced, and afterwards further reduced. It is now proposed to construct the chambers of iron, 7-ft. by 5-ft. by 7-ft. in depth, which would occupy a space of 7-ft. 6 in. by 5-ft. 6-in. and a depth of 10-ft. 3-in. from the surface of the pavement to the bottom of the concrete. The Board of Trade convened a conference of the parties concerned, at which this Board urged their objections to the construction of the proposed chambers on the ground of the obstruction which they would cause and of the danger arising therefrom, this danger hiving been shown by the occurrence of explosions in various parts of London from other underground structures connected with electric lighting. The Company contended that they were authorised to construct the proposed chambers under the provisions of the order, which empower them to construct in any street "such boxes as may be necessary for pur"poses in connection with the supply of energy, including "apparatus for the proper ventilation of such boxes," and provide that such boxes shall be used " for the purpose "of leading off service lines, and other distributing con"ductors, or for examining, testing, regulating, measuring, "directing, or controlling the supply of energy, or for "examining or testing the condition of the mains, or "other portions of the works, or for other like purposes "connected with the undertaking, and the undertakers "may place therein meters, switches, and any other suit"able and proper apparatus for any of the above purposes." The Board urged that transforming chambers are not within the meaning of the terms "street boxes," and Sir Courtenay Boyle, Secretary of the Board of Trade, who presided at the Conference, admitted that when application was made to Parliament to authorise the placing 15 under the streets of street boxes there was no idea in the minds of the Board of Trade when they framed the Provisional Order that street boxes would be extended to mean transformer chambers. After full consideration, however, the Board of Trade decided to provisionally approve of the system proposed to be adopted, and the Company thereupon gave formal notice of their intention to proceed with the works, and submitted amended plans. The Board intimated during the conference that as they were advised that the term "street boxes" would not apply to transformer chambers, they would, in the event of the Board of Trade approving of the system, apply for an injunction to restrain the Company from constructing the proposed chambers under the public way in the district; and Sir Courtenay Boyle stated that the proceedings there would not bar the Board from proceeding by injunction ; that the Board of Trade had no power to give the Company any rights as regard public streets which are not given in the Order, but that in settling the regulations and conditions under which the Company were to carry out the Order the Board of Trade would act as if the word "boxes" did include transformer chambers. The Board are of opinion that the construction of these transformer chambers in the streets would be a great obstruction, and that the chambers are likely to be a source of public danger. This obstruction and danger can be avoided by constructing the chambers above ground on private property adjoining the streets, and the question is really only one of expense. Whilst the Board are desirous of giving every proper facility to the introduction of the electric light into the district, they feel bound to protect the interests of the public in the matter. They have, therefore, approved of the amended plans so far as regards the laying of the electric mains, but they object to the construction ot the transformer chambers as proposed, and they are taking proceedings with the view of preventing their construction in the public way. 16 Equalisation of Rates. One of the amendments to this Bill, suggested in the Board's petition to Parliament, set out in the annual report for last year, was incorporated in the Act, provision being made for the taking of a census in London in the year 1896 and also for the effect of alterations in the population between the times appointed for taking a census. The suggestion of the Board that in determining the amount of the grant each parish in the district should be treated as a separate unit was not adopted. In February last the Board received the sum of £3,048 1s. 7d., under the Act, in respect of the half-year beginning 30th September, 1894. This sum was apportioned as follows, viz.: Parish of Clapham, £810 8s.; Putney, £336 9s. 4d; Streatham, £864 16s. 6d.; Tooting, £108 3s. 4d.; Wandsworth, £928 4s. 5d. London Streets and Buildings. This Bill, which was reported on last year, after very full consideration by Committees of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, was passed and came into operation on the 1st January last. Streatham Hill Tramways. This Bill, to which reference was made in the last annual report, having received the Royal Assent, the Board are taking the necessary steps for acquiring the land required for widening Streatham Hill, and have constructed, at a cost of about £1,100, the sewer there, towards which the Company contributed £500. With the view of expediting the laying of the tramways the Board have agreed to the Company proceeding with the construction of the line before the widening of the road has been effected, on the understanding that the line is not to be opened for traffic until the widening has been completed. On the application of the Company the Board have consented to the use of cable traction on the line, subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Board of Trade sanction to the use of cable traction on the other part of the line. 17 Local Government Act, 1894 Upon the application of the Vestries of Clapham, Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth, supported by this Board, under section 33, sub-section 1, of this Act, the Local Government Board have made orders conferring upon those Vestries the right to appoint Overseers. The Vestries of Clapham and Wandsworth also applied for the power of appointing and revoking the appointment of Assistant Overseers, and this subject is under the consideration of the Local Government Board. Extension of Cab radius. The Board took part in the proceedings of a deputation of representatives of Vestries and District Boards, which waited upon the Home Secretary in favour of the extension of the cab radius, but nothing having been done in the matter, the Board have again written to the Home Secretarv in favor of the extension of the cab radius to the area of the County of London. Removal of fecal matter, &c. The Corporation of the City of London, having applied to the Local Government Board for an order assigning to them the power to make bye-laws with regard to the removal, by water, of fæcal, or offensive, or noxious matter, in or through the Port of London Sanitary District, the Local Government Board held an inquiry at the Guildhall on the 26th June last. This Board suggested at the inquiry that the conditions with regard to the vessels used for conveying house refuse and road sweepings down the river Thames should not be more stringent than those prescribed by the bye-law made by the London County Council, under section 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1801 ; that there should be no restriction as to time with regard to the removal of such materials, and that if bye-laws were made, the sanitary authorities should have an opportunity of making any representations to the Local Government Board thereon before they were sanctioned. The representative of the Corporation, present at the inquiry, did not object 18 to the adoption of these suggestions. The order applied for has been issued, but the bye-laws have not yet been made. Spread of Disease by Vagrants. In July last the London County Council invited the Board to appoint two delegates, with the Medical Officers of Health, to attend a Conference on this subject. The Conference was presided over by Sir John Hutton, Chairman of the London County Council, and representatives from sanitary and poor law authorities from London and the provinces were present numbering over 100. The following resolutions were adopted, viz.:— 1.—That common shelters, which are net subject to the law relating to common lodging houses, should be made subject to such law. 2.—That there should be power in the hands of the local authorities to require medical examination of all persons entering common lodging houses and casual wards, and that each inmate should be supplied with a bath of fresh water. 3.—That the local authority should have power to order the keeper of a common lodging house, in which there has been infectious disease, to refuse fresh admissions for such time as may be required by the authority. 4.—That the local authority should be empowered to require the temporary closing of any common lodging house in which infectious disease has occurred. 5.—That the local sanitary authorities should have power to require the detention of any inmate of a common lodging house, or a casual ward, who may reasonably be suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. 6.—That means should be provided for the detention and isolation of any vagrant found wandering in a public place, if reasonably suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease 7.—That the local authority should have full power to require the disinfection of the person and clothes of any person in a common lodging house or casual ward, whether infected or exposed to infection. 8.—That arrangements should be made by which the occutrence of infectious disease in common lodging houses, or casual wards, should be made known by the local authority of the district to the local authorities of other districts. 9.—That local authorities should be empowered to require the vaccination or re-vaccination of persons in common lodging houses, or casual wards, who are exposed to the infection of small-pox. 19 Richmond Lock and Weir. The Hammersmith Vestry invited the Board to appoint delegates to accompany a Committee of such Vestry on an inspection of the river to note the result of the construction of the Richmond lock and weir, with the view of a conference of riparian authorities being convened to consider the subject, it being alleged that the works in question had resulted in a considerable deposit of mud, and a reduction of the depth of water in the river below the new lock. Delegates were appointed to attend the inspection of the river, and also to take part in the Conference, at which the following resolution was passed, viz.:— "That this Conference appoint a Committee, consisting of two Members "from each Council or Authority invitei to-day, to prepare a "petition with the view of its being presented in the name of all "the Authorities represented here, calling upon the Thames "Conservancy to appoint a Commission to enquire into the stale "of the Thames below Richmond Lock, and the best remedy for "the existing state of things." The petition referred to has been presented, and it was proposed to take a daily record of the condition of the river with the view of further action, but after fuller consideration the Board came to the conclusion that they were not justified in incurring further expense in the matter at present. Appointment of Medical Officers of Health. Upon the death of Dr. Nicholas, Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Wandsworth, Dr. P. Caldwell Smith was appointed to act as Medical Officer of Health pending the appointment of a successor to Dr. Nicholas. Under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, it is now necessary to obtain the consent of the Local Government Board to the terms of these appointments, and one-half of the officer's salary is to be repaid to the local authority by the London County Council. On applying to the Local Government Board for their consent to the appointment B 2 20 of a Medical Officer for the parish upon similar terms to those of Dr. Nicholas's appointment, objection was raised to the appointment of a separate Medical Officer of Health for that parish, and the Board were urged to include Wandsworth in the district of one of the other Medical Officers oi Health, with the view of the remaining parishes being also included as vacancies occurred, so that eventually there would be only one Medical Officer of Health for the whole of the district the whole of his time being given to the work of the office. After lengthened correspondence, however, the Local Government Board stated that they would not offer any further objection to the Board's proposal, but they hoped that on the occurrence of another vacancy in the district the Board would give due weight to the views which the Local Government Board had expressed on the subject. Advertisements were accordingly issued, twenty-four applications for the appointment were received, and after seeing three selected candidates the Board appointed Dr. P. Caldwell Smith to the vacant office. PrioryTane. The Board have been again approached by H. M. Office of Works on the subject of the desirability of opening up Priory Lane, Roehampton, for public traffic, and forming an entrance into Richmond Park from Clarence Lane. The Board informed the Office of Works, in reply to their communication, that upon Priory Lane being properly made up to the satisfaction of the Board, they would undertake the future lighting and maintenance thereof, and suggested that they should communicate with the London County Council on the subject. This suggestion was acted upon, and the Council then asked whether in the event of their undertaking the making up of the road the Board would contribute towards the cost. The Board did not see their way to make any contribution, being of opinion that the proposed improvement was at least a 21 Metropolitan one, but offered to make up the road if the London County Council would pay the cost of the work. The Council, however, decided that the improvement would not be of such general advantage to London as to justify the Council in bearing the whole of the cost, and nothing further has been done in the matter. Site for Board School, Streatham Hill. The School Board for London having scheduled No. 72, Streatham Hill (Arborfield), as a site for a new school, the Board appointed a deputation to wait upon the School Board, objecting thereto, on the ground that-it was unsuitable and dangerous for the children who would attend the school, and they suggested the Artizans' &c., Dwellings Company's estate as a more suitable situation for the proposed school. The deputation attended before the School Board and presented a memorial in support of the Board's views, and the proposal to acquire the site objected to was subsequently abandoned. Proposed transfer of Streatham to Schedule A. The Vestry of Streatham, having appointed a Committee to consider and report upon the desirability and effect of transferring the parish of Streatham, either solely or in combination with some other parish or district, from Schedule B to Schedule A of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Committee asked the Board to allow the Clerk to assist the Committee in their enquiry. The Board, however, passed a resolution disapproving of any proposal to separate the parish of Streatham from the district of the Board. Combined Drainage. The memorial presented to the London County Council by the Conference of Representatives of Vestries and District Boards, to which reference was made in the last report, was considered by the Main 22 Drainage Committee of the Council, who reported adversely to the suggestion of the Conference,—that application thould be made by the Council to Parliament to alter the definition of the word "drain" in the Metropolis Local Management Act. This Board attach great importance to the suggested amendment of the law, and they therefore called the attention of the members of the Council for this district to the subject, and when the report of the Committee came before the Council the matter was referred back for further consideration. A deputation from the above-mentioned Conference then had another interview with the Mam Drainage Committee, and, after further considering the subject, the Committee recommended the Council to introduce a Bill into Parliament in accordance with the desire of the Conference. This recommendation was adopted and a Bill is now being prepared by the Council. Charges upon Places of Worship for Paving New Streets. The Board have had under consideration the subject of the charges made under orders of apportionment of the cost of paving new streets, &c. in respect of places of worship situate in such streets. It has been decided by the High Court that places of worship belonging to the Established Church, being consecrated and therefore permanently devoted to the purposes of religious worship, are exempt from such charges, but nonconformist places of worship are not exempt. TTnder the provisions of sec. 151 of the Public Health Act, 1875, all places of worship used exclusively for that purpose are exempt. The last mentioned Act does not apply to London, and the Board see no reason why the law in this respect within the Metropolis should be at variance with that for the other part of the country. The Board therefore addressed a communication to the London County Council, asking them to obtain an amendment of the Metropolis Man- 23 ageinent Acts, so as to extend to London the provisions of the above-mentioned section of the Public Health Act. The Council did not see tlxeir way to comply with the request of the Board, but it appeared that they had previously been in communication with the Local Government Board on the subject, and they have again urged that Board to take steps with the view of removing the injustice complained of. Public Lighting. The Board have had under consideration the subject of improving the lighting of the district, and, as an experiment, incandescent burners have been provided to some lamps in each parish. The Board have also resolved that in the district lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Co., all new lamps and renewals shall be of the pattern known as the "Balhain" lantern, which gives a much better light than the lantern now in use. The contract for the supply of lamps in the other part of the district of the Board expires at Lady Day, 1897, when the subject of the description of lamp to be used in that part of the district will be considered. Cheap Trains. At the invitation of the Battersea Yestry the Board appointed delegates to attend a conference of the local governing bodies in South London with the object of securing cheaper trains, improved accommodation, and greater facilities for obtaining tickets on the lines of the various railway companies. Resolutions in support of the object were agreed to, and a deputation appointed to wait upon the promoters of the Cheap Trains (London) Bill and the Railway Companies. The Unemployed. In February last a letter was reoeived by the Chairman from the Local Government Board asking for information as to whether there was any exceptional distress in the district, and how far it was due to circumstances peculiar to the locality or to the severe 24 weather, and on other points on the subject, to which the following reply was sent, viz.:— 1.—There is some exceptional distress in this district, due to the severe weather. 2.—As in previous winters this Board are doing what they can to find work for the unemployed. The making up of several roads and the construction of a sewer was ordered a few weeks ago, but owing to the frost these works have been practically at a standstill. The Board have employed as many men as possible in removing snow, sanding roads, &c. The average daily number so employed, exclusive of those already in the employment of the Board, duritig the first three days of the week ended 16th February was 19. During the Jast three days none were so employed. In fact owing to the frost the Board had difficulty in finding work for their regular men. I may add that the average daily number of men (exclusive of the Board's regular men) employed as above-mentioned during the week ended 2nd February was 481, and the average daily number for the week ended 9th February 108. The Guardians of the Poor of the Union have opened a stoneyard for the unemployed: you will no doubt receive particulars as to this from the Guardians. Some relief is given in money, coal, soup, &c., by philanthropic societies in various parts of the district. , 3.—The Board in January, 1894, opened a free labour register at Wandsworth, and kept it open for three months, during which time 165 men and 35 women were registered. Handbills were circulated and posted throughout the district giving notice thereof, but only eight employers of labour inspected the register, and the only person who found employment through its agency was a domestic servant. The Board do not think that any good result would be obtained by re-opening the register. 4.—The only suggestion I can make is that local authorities should carry out as much of their work as possible during the winter, but, as is pointed out above, with regard to many of these works it is practically impossible to proceed with them in time of severe frost. Water Transfer Bills. The London County Council are promoting eight Bills for the transfer to them of the undertakings of the several London Water Companies. The following abstract of the Bills was laid before the Board by the Clerk, viz.;— New Biver Waterworks (Transfer! Bill. This Bill has been introduced into Parliament by the London County Council. Its object is the transfer to the Council of the water undertaking of the New River Company. This term moans the undertaking works and property of the Company as a Water 25 Works Company, together with all stock and plant used in connection with the water works and all lands likely to be required for water works purposes. The lands, tenements, and hereditaments of the Company producing revenue are not dealt with by the Bill. Clause 4 empowers the Company and the Council to enter into an agreement for the sale and transfer to the Council of tlie water undertaking or any part thereof upon such terms as may be agreed upon. Clauses 5, 6, and 7 provide (in the event of an agreement not being made under Clause 4) for the transfer of the water undertaking upon such terms as may be determined by arbitration. The Council and the Company will each appoint an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators are to appoint an umpire. The arbitrators will together hear and determine the matters referred to them, and they may appoint any engineer, barrister, solicitor, surveyor, accountant, or other person having special knowledge of the subject, to act as their assessor and to advise them upon any matters upon which they may desire information. Clause 8 provides that the consideration to be paid by the Council shall be such sum as the arbitrators determine to be the fair and reasonable value of the water undertaking, after allowing for the liability involved in regard to the Debenture Stock, and having regard to all the circumstances of the case. In determining this value, the arbitrators are to have regard to the following amongst other matters, viz.:— 1. The condition and state of repair of the reservoirs, filter beds, filtration arrangements, wells, mains, conduits, pipes, machinery, and plant of the New River Company, and the probabilty of future expenditure thereon, together with any liabilities or obligations in connection with the water undertaking which the New River Company mav reasonably be required or expected to incur; 2. The legal powers of the New River Company to take water and the probabilities of such powers being limited; 3. The adequacy and efficiency of the present sources of supply, and of the reservoirs, filter-beds, filtration arrangements, wells, mains, conduits, pipes, machinery, and plant of the New River Company to meet present and future requirements; 4. The probable necessity of the future introduction of a new source of supply or new or improved works; 5. The legality of tho charges now made or claimed to be made by the New River Company, together with the circumstances under which such powers of charge have been granted by Parliament; 6. The deductions from any compensation claimed by the New River Company which may in the opinion of the arbitrators be reasonably made in respect of any insufficiency of tho present storage or filtration of the New River Company, or in respect of the provision of supplementary supplies; 7. The deductions to be made in respect of works, plant, or appliances which have become wholly or partially useless, and the adjustment of the revenue account of the New River Company in respect of repairs and renewals properly chargeable thereto; 8. The statutory powers of any other Company to compete in any part of the New River Company's District, and the rights of any other Company or body to supply wator in tho New River Company's District, whether as now existing under statute or otherwise, or as may be likely to exist in the future; 9. The effect of the amendment of "The New River Company's Act of 1852," and the incorporation of Section 35 of "The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847,' with the New River Company's Acts. 26 The Clause also provides that no allowance shall be made by the arbitrators in respect of any claim of the New River Company to divide profits in respect of their Waterworks Capital by way of "back dividends," or in respect of any assumed future increase of the rateable value of buildings and hereditaments within the New River Company's District other than an increase due to alterations or additions involving increased supply of water; that no addition shall be made to the fair and reasonable value of the water undertaking in respect of compulsory sale; and that if the Council so require, the consideration to be paid by the Council for the transfer of the undertaking shall be in the form of a half-yearly or other periodical payment by the Council to the New River Company charged upon the County Fund for a period of not less than eighty or more than one hundred years. Clause 9 empowers the Council and the Company to enter into an agreement for the issue by the Council and acceptance by the Company of Metropolitan Consolidated Stock Annuities, or other security, in lieu of the payment of the whole or any part of the sum found by the arbitrators to be the fair value of the undertaking. Clauses 10 to 16 contain transitory provisions and deal with the inspection of works, examination of accounts, the Company's debts, books, &c., and provide for the exercise by the Council of all the rights, powers, and privileges of the Company relating to the supply of water. Clauses 17 to 22 provide for the redemption of the Debenture Stock, the mode of payment of the consideration for the purchase of the undertaking, and the adjustment of accounts. Clause 23 provides for the transfer to the Council of officers of the Company, and for compensation for loss of office, &c. Clauses 24 to 27 provide that the Council shall have the same obligations as the Company with regard to the supply of water in the district of the Company outside London, but the Council may enter into agreements with Local Authorities for the sale or lease to them of the mains, &c., and the rights and powers of supplying water in their respective districts, and may supply water in bulk to such Authorities for the supply by them to their districts. Local Authorities may purchase these mains, &c., rights, and powers from the Council upon such terms as may be settled by agreement or by arbitration. Clause 28 provides for tho keeping of a separate account by the Council relating to their water undertaking. Seven other Bills upon similar lines, varied to suit the different circumstances of each case, have been introduced by the Council for the purchase of the undertakings of the Chelsea, East London, Grand Junction, Kent, Lambeth, Southwark and Yauxhall, and the West Middlesex Waterworks Companies. The Bills dealing with the undertakings of the Lambeth and the Southwark and Yauxhall Companies were referred by the House of Commons to a Select 27 mittee. This Board are in favour of the transfer of the undertakings of the London Water Companies to a public authority, but they are of opinion that the London County Council is not the fittest body for the purpose, and that a Water Trust should be constituted on which the large areas outside London, which are supplied by the same Companies, should be represented. The Board, therefore, petitioned against the Bills and counsel appeared on their behalf before the Committee. Early in the proceedings the Committee intimated that the terms of the reference did not enable them to consider an alternative scheme, and as the views of the Board had been brought before the Committee, the Board, in view of the great length to which the enquiry was likely to extend and the consequent heavy expensfc of continuing their appearance, decided to withdraw counsel for the time. A.t the time of writing this report the Committee are still sitting. The six other Bills have not yet been read a second time. Billls in Parliament. The following Bills, which have been introduced in the present Session, have also been considered by the Board, viz.:— 1—London County Council (General Powers). 2—London County Council (Tower Bridge Southern Approach). 3—London County Council (Vauxhall Bridge). 4—London County Council (London County Tramways). o—London County Council (London Valuation and Assessment). 6 — City and South London Railway (Extension of Time). 7—London and South Western Railway. 8—Lambeth Water Works. 9—Chelsea Water Works. 10 —South Metropolitan Gas Company. 11—Factories and Workshops. 12—Public Health. 13—Public Health Acts Amendment. 14—Tramways (Local Authorities). 28 Tower Bridge (Southern Approach) Bill. The Board have urged upon the London County Council not to delay the carrying out of this work should the betterment clauses not be passed. The Bill has not yet been reported by the Select Committee of the House of Commons to whom it was referred. The Council have agreed to a modification of the betterment clauses with the view of meeting the opposition to those clauses as drawn. London County Tramways Bill. The Board disapproved of this Bill, which would enable the Council to work any tramway acquired by them, and to provide stables, horses, engines, and plantfor that purpose. The Board communicated their views to the Council and to the Members of Parliament, and of the Council for this district, but did not take any active steps in opposition. The Bill has been passed by the House of Commons Committee. London Valuation and Assessment Bill. This Bill has been withdrawn, the Speaker having ruled that it could not be proceeded with as a private Bill. The Bill as drawn was on the same lines as the Bill of last Session, mentioned in last year's Report. The Council have now amended the Bill by leaving out those provisions (relating to the assessment of properties such as railways, canals, &c., extending into more than one parish, and to the constitution of the valuation court) to which opposition was expected, and have given instructions for its introduction as a public Bill. Factory and Workshops Bill. The Medical Officers of Health reported upon this Bill, suggesting some amendments, and a copy of the report was forwarded to the Home Secretary, who has charge of the Bill, and to the Local Government Board, with a request that the amendments suggested by the Medical Officers of Health might be made. The bill 29 is under the consideration of the Standing Committee on Trade. The Board took no action with regard to the other Bills above-mentioned. Water Supply during Frost. In consequence of tho severe frost experienced from the beginning of January (with the exception of the week January 14th-21st) to the 20th of February, 1895, having interfered with the water supply, numerous memorials complaining of the insufficiency of such supply were addressed to the Local Government Board by residents in this district and other parts of London, under- the provisions of section 9 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1852, and the Local Government Board appointed Major-General de Courcy Scott, R.E., to enquire into the complaints and to report to them thereon. This Board also sealed memorials in respect of both the Lambeth and the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Companies. There were 17 memorials from residents in this district, viz., 4 from districts supplied by the Lambetli Company. 12 from districts supplied by the Southwark aud Yauxhall Company, and one from a district supplied by the two Companies. The Board placed their boardroom at the disposal of Major-General Scott, and the first enquiries were held there on the 9th, 11th, 18th, 19th. 25th, 26th, 29tli, and 30th of April, and the 9th of May, when evidence was given by a large number of the memorialists as to their being without a supply of water to their houses, both during and after the frost, and as to the defective arrangements made by the Companies by standpipes and other means for supplying residents with water. The Board's surveyors also gave evidence as to the depth of the mains, communication pipes, &c., and as to the occurrence of bursts in and the condition of the mains. General Scott then adjourned the enquiry sine die 30 for the purpose of enabling the Companies to prepare their replies to the complaints. Similar enquiries have subsequently been held in other parts of London. The Board did all in their power to assist in the distribution of water by letting on hire to the Companies their water carts and vans, which were filled at standpipes and the water delivered at the houses of residents in the district. Amalgamation of the City and County of London. The Commissioners appointed under the Royal Warrants of 27th March and 5th April, 1893, to consider the proper conditions under which the amalgamation of the City and County of London could be effected, and to make specific and practical proposals for that purpose, issued their report on the 7th of August last. The recommendations contained in the report would in effect merge the City Corporation in the London County Council, retaining for the new body the name of the former—"The Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of London." Eight representatives would be elected by the City (termed in the report the Old City J to the new Corporation, and one additional alderman would be appointed. The City Police, now under the control of the Corporation, would be fused with the Metropolitan Police. The local authority for the City (proposed to be called "The Mayor and Council of the Old City") would be similar to the local authority for the other districts in London, but would have in addition the management of city charities and trusts and the property belonging thereto. The Commissioners express the opinion "that everything possible should be done to "maintain the strength, authority, and dignity of the local "bodies of London, and that in the partition of functions "between the Corporation of London and local authority "the former should be relieved of all administrative "details for which its intervention is not really necessary, "and the latter should be entrusted with every duty they "can conveniently discharge. In the case of doubt our 31 "inclinations would lean to the allotment of functions to "the local bodies, and we believe that in cases where "uniformity of action is necessary this may often be best "secured by giving to the Corporation the authority to "frame bye-laws, which should be locally administered, "with provision, however, for the intervention of the "Corporation to secure their enforcement should they be "neglected." The Commissioners suggest that the powers of Vestries and District Boards should be extended so as to embrace the functions of providing burial grounds, public libraries, baths and wash-houses, the registration of births, &c., and the enforcement of the vaccination acts. It would be in accordance with this view that the duties of District Surveyor should be transferred to the local authority, as has been frequently suggested by this Board. The Commissioners think that the administration of the "Weights and Measures Act, the Food and Drugs Acts, and the Petroleum and Explosives Acts should be in the hands of the central authority, and they suggest that some machinery should be provided for the re-partition of functions between the central and local authority, as experience may prove desirable, without having recourse to Parliament in each particular case. The Commissioners suggest that the number of members of the respective local authorities should be 72, and that such authorities should be called Councils and elect Mayors of their respective districts. It is also suggested that the member of the central body elected for any district should be an ex officio member of the local authority of the district. With regard to the areas for local administration the Commissioners express the opinion, "that while some of the "existing areas are of a convenient and suitable size, "others might, with advantage, be grouped even more "than at present." The Commissioners further say: "In "order to adopt universally the proposal that the members 32 "of the Corporation representing any given area should "be ex officio members of the local governing body it "would be necessary that the areas for local administration "should either coincide with the areas for electing mem"bers of the Corporation, or should actually contain two "or more of them." The Queen's Speech at the opening of Parliament on the 9th of February contained a reference to the report of the Commissioners, and stated that a Bill would be laid before Parliament founded on its recommendations, but the Bill has not yet been introduced. Appointment of Chairman of the Board. At the tirst Meeting of the Board after the election of Members in June, 1895, Mr. Benjamin Weir, J.P., was unanimously re-elected Chairman for the year. Death of a Member. The Board regret to have to record the death of Mr. W. H. Millar, one of the members for the parish of Clapham, which occurred suddenly on the I Oth of February last. 33 orders of apportionment.

From the 5th to the 20th February it was of unprecedented severity, causing considerable damage to roads and water mains, and completely dislocating the water supply. The damage done was in some measure owing to the intense frost occurring after the snow was removed, for had the roads been covered with snow some protection would have been afforded to the water mains and pipes under the surface. 70 ROAD WATERING.

The birth-rate was 25.17 per thousand, compared with 27.1 in 1893. The mean rate for the last ten years was 28.9. The birth-rate for London was 30.1. The rate was lower than any in the last decade, or indeed in all the years of which we have record. The natural increase of the population, or the excess of births over deaths, corresponds with a rate of 12.57 per thousand persons living. Deaths. The total number was 2,155, consisting of 1,080 of males and 1,009 of females, compared with 2,370 in 1893. Of these 337 were of persons not properly belonging to this district who died in hospitals and institutions within its borders. They should be excluded in calculating the death rate, but the 405 deaths in outlying institutions should be added, the total then becoming 2,223. The corrected death rate calculated from this total was 12.6 per thousand. The following Table shows the distribution in the subdistricts :— TABLE II. DEATHS.

Small Pox.—It is satisfactory to record that no death and only one case of this disease occurred. In 1893 there were 29 cases. The district was more fortunate than London as a whole, for the total number of cases in the Metropolis in 1894,was 1,192, compared with 2,813 in 1893. Small pox has,however,been more prevalent this year on the North than on the South of the Thames, but, considering its wide distribution in 1893, it is a matter for great satisfaction that the disease has been so rapidly reduced in proportions. Scarlet Fever.—19 deaths were caused by scarlet fever, 12 at the isolation hospitals and 7 at their homes — if the 50 outside deaths at the Fountain Hospital are eliminated. The number in 1893 was 67. The number notified was 675 against 1,256 last year Thus the epidemic of 1893 has to a great extent disappeared though not altogether. The figures for the whole of London show a drop from 36,901 in 1893 to 18,440 in 1894. The number removed to the isolation hospitals was 379, or 56.3 per cent. of the whole. The mortality per cent. of those removed was 31 and of those remaining at home 2.7. The difficulty mentioned in our last report of getting scarlet fever patients promptly removed to hospitals was not experienced in 1894, there being plenty of beds available for the fever cases. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—There were 343 cases reported, as against 431 in the previous year. The deaths were 87 (neglecting 52 deaths at the Fountain Hospital) 52 at home and 35 in the hospitals. The mortality was 25.3 per cent. There were 130 cases removed to hospital, or 37.9 per cent of the whole. Though the number notified is less than in 1893 it is 16 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. still very large. There is not and has not been proportionally more diphtheria in the Wandsworth District than in the rest of London, so that the question of the increase of it, that has been so prominent a one in recent years, is truly a Metropolitan one. An interesting contribution to the study of the question has been made by the Medical Officer of Health to the County Council, in a preliminary memorandum on the increase of diphtheria in London. In this he shows that there has been a more marked increase of the disease between the ages of 3 and 10 since the passing of the Elementary Education Act of 1870, and thus draws attention to one factor, that is now generally recognised as being responsible for the spread of diphtheria, that is, the aggregation of children in the elementary schools. But it is very difficult to provide against its spread in this way. Diphtheria is a disease that is very difficult to diagnose, and it is at present impossible to prevent a certain number of children, suffering from diphtheria in a mild, unrecognised form, from being at school and so infecting others. Possibly the universal adoption of examining every case of sore throat by bacteriological methods, to define the presence or absence of the diphtheria bacillus in the throat would overcome this difficulty, but this is a suggestion at present quite impracticable. In this connection it is important to notice that the system of applying these tests to all cases admitted to the Asylums Board Hospitals and also before their discharge has been adopted. The examination before discharge is particularly important, as it appears that the bacillus is present in the throat for sometimes a considerable period after apparent recovery. It is not unlikely, however, that school influence is not the only reason why we now have so much diphtheria, but that during these last few years an epidemic wave of the disease has been passing over London, just as we are accustomed to like waves of scarlet fever every 3 or 4 years. District. 17 Practically, the difficulty in diagnosis is certainly one main reason why the efforts used to check its spread are not more successful. Enteric Fever.—There were 21 deaths, 18 at home and 3 in hospitals. There were 128 cases notified, an increase on previous years. The mortality was 16.3 per cent. There were also 13 cases of continued fever notified, with 1 death. Puerperal Fever. — Of the 19 cases notified, 13 died, a considerable mortality, and probably largely preventable. Erysipelas.—243 cases were notified. There were 14 deaths. Measles caused 82 deaths, a larger number than in any year since 1890. There was apparently a good deal of measles in 1891. It is impossible to doubt that many of these children's lives might have been saved by proper care, as they nearly all resulted from lung complications as the result of a chill added to the measles. As it is not the custom among the poorer classes, where all these deaths occur, to seek medical advice in measles, unless the child gets ill from bronchitis or pneumonia, it would be a valuable step for all who come in contact with the poor to try to teach them to take common care of their children while suffering from this dangerous disorder. Sometimes children are not kept in bed at all, and if they are it is only for a day or two and then they are allowed to play about in the streets to the great risk of themselves and others. II hooping Cough resulted in 54 deaths. This is a small figure compared with previous years, and is remarkable because there is usually a close association between epidemics of measles and whooping cough. c 18 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Influenza.—45 deaths are referred to this cause. It is a smaller number than in any year since 1890 when the disease first reappeared ; since the close of the year, however, there has been a terrible recrudescence. Diarrhoea, as was to be expected from the unusually cool summer and autumn, was not so fatal as usual. Only 59 deaths were due to it, compared with 114 in the previous year. In connection more especially with the spread of smallpox a Conference was summoned in July by the Public Health and Housing Committee of the London County Council, consisting of representatives of Sanitary Authorities, County Councils and the Asylums Board, at which your Board was represented. The subject discussed was the spread of disease by vagrants, and a series of resolutions were, after much debate, adopted. To carry them into force alterations of the law would be needed, but such a Conference will no doubt strengthen the case for such alteration. Deaths from Non -Zymotic Diseases.—Table VII. enables a comparison to be made with previous years. It is seen that the deaths from cancer and other tumours have increased this year, there being 115 deaths compared with 90 last year, and they are more numerous than in any of the preceding years. Diseases of the tubercular class, consumption, &c., are much the same as in previous years, but there is a fall under the head of nervous diseases. The greatest decrease, however, is under the head of respiratory diseases, where there were only 340 deaths, the fewest since 1889. There is also a noticeable decrease under the head of premature birth, &c., 164 deaths only being referred to this cause. The low general mortality is largely due to the small number of deaths from lung diseases, and this is partly accounted for by the weather. District. 19 During the spring when the deaths from this cause are usually highest, there was a remarkable absence of cold winds with much sunshine. The cool summer that followed caused the low diarrhoeal mortality, so that the climatic conditions were altogether favourable. Inquests.—The next Table gives particulars of the results of the Inquests held in the district during the year.

The London County Council again arranged with Dr. Klein to make bacteriological investigations into any suspected case, and this was taken advantage of in one instance, the result being found to be "negative." The Local Government Board issued a circular in July drawing attention to the fact that cholera was often preceded by diarrhoea excessive in amount, and stating that they would be prepared to consider favourably any application to add diarrhoea to the list of notifiable diseases till the end of the then current quarter. 22 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Our opinions on the suggestion were expressed in the following Report:— THE BOARD OF WORKS FOE THE WANDSWORTH DISTRICT. CHOLERA-NOTIFICATION OF DIARRHOEA. In pursuance with the instructions of your Sanitary Committee, wo beg to report on the circular on the above subject from the Local Government Board. The circular reminds Sanitary Authorities that the utmost vigilance should be exercised to control any diarrhoea which may be suspicious either in character or in amount during the present season, and it states that the Local Government Board would give favourable consideration to any application to add diarrhoea to the list of notifiable diseases until the termination of the current quarter. In our opinion the addition of diarrhoea to the list would not very greatly help us to decide whether there existed diarrhoea suspioious in character or in amount. It is always our experience to have an increased amount of diarrhœal disease present iu the summer and autumn months, but having no standard of the amount existing in former years, the number of cases notified during this season would not prove whether it is present in excessive amount or not. The same would be true with regard to the severity of the cases notified. Also the term diarrhoea is of very undefined meaning. It includes all conditions from the very slightest departure from health to a severe disease. All cases of whatever their type, would, however, compulsorily be notified if the suggestion were adopted, as it would be quite impossible to limit the application of the requirements of the law to the cases of severe type. The consequence would not only be a very great increase in the cost of notification; but, owing to our being overwhelmed by the number of certificates, we should be quite unable with the present staff of Sanitary Inspectors to take any action in investigating District. 23 individual cases, and should practically have to be content with simply recording the number received. At the same time if it be thought that it would not be right to neglect any means that might by any possibility be useful in combating cholera, then we consider that diarrhoea, if made notifiable at all, should be made so for the whole County of London. This can only be done by the London County Council. It appears to us, however, that more can be done under the present provisions of the law. In the Public Health (London) Act, sec. 55, the word "cholera" is used in the list of notifiable diseases. In this district, at all events, it is understood by medical practitioners to mean only Asiatic cholera. We think it means any kind of cholera, whether Asiatic or British. We would suggest that a circular be sent to all medical practitioners in the district pointing out that in the opinion of the Board " Cholera " means British cholera not only Asiatic. We should then obtain notification of cases of severe diarrhoea (British cholera) which would we think be very desirable. July 23, 1894. Disinfection of Bedding,&c. The question of providing a disinfection station for this district instead of the present system of having it done by contract, was under consideration during the early part of the year. The following report was drawn up by your Medical Officers of Health and Surveyors. "Gentlemen, "We beg to report that pursuant to your instructions we have considered the subject of the cost of disinfection. " The great increase in this cost during the past year was caused by the epidemic of scarlet fever, now abating, and the more expensive system of disinfection brought about by the Public Health Act. We do not, however, think it would be safe to assume that in future there may not be occasionally, if not continuously, as great a call upon the Board for this work as was the case last year. 24 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. "The Surveyors have made enquiries as to (he cost of providing a disinfecting apparatus, and have visited for this purpose the disinfecting establishments at St. Pancras; the London Hospital. Whitechapel; the City Depot, Golden Lane; and that of the Strand District Board of Works. At St. Pancras the apparatus of Messrs. Goddard, Massey, and Warner is in use, and at the three other places Mr. Washington Lyon's apparatus is used. The latter could be provided d and fixed for about £1,000 (exclusive of cost of site). The cost of maintenance, taking into account depreciation of plant, repayments of loan, and all other outgoings, would be about £400 per annum. " Should the Board decide to carry out the work of disinfecting without the intervention of a contractor, it would be more economical to have one establishment for the whole district than to have several establishments in different localities. On the other hand, there would probably in such case be difficulties of management and a want of adequate supervision. The system of the Board is to have the executive work carried out in the respective parishes separately, and we are of opinion that the best management and supervision would be secured by providing an apparatus for a parish specially, as the work would then have the constant attention of the officers for that parish. Moreover, the articles requiring disinfectiou would then have to be conveyed a shorter distance, and the cases would bo more promptly dealt with as they occur. We desire to add that there is no cause for complaint as to the efficiency of the system of disinfection carried out by the Board's contractor. In the parish of Clapham some inconvenience and additional expense has been caused by having to provide bedding temporarily for the use of persons whose bedding is being disinfected, as, owing to the distance of the contractor's place of business, it is sometimes impossible to have bedding taken away, disinfected, and returned on the same day." The ultimate decision arrived at was that a disinfecting apparatus should not be provided for the entire district, but that the matter should be left to each parish. Only one parish has at present definitely decided to erect one. Disinfection of public vehicles. After the opening of the Fountain Fever Hospital within the district, a letter was 25 District. received from the managers of the Asylums' Board stating that in spite of the provisions of the Public Health Act, patients were occasionally taken to the hospital in public cabs, and inquiring whether the Board would undertake to disinfect them. After consideration by your Sanitary Committee, an answer was sent suggesting that it would be much more satisfactory that the disinfection should be done before allowing the cab to leave the hospital, as otherwise it would be very likely that the driver would not trouble to take his vehicle to some other place for the purpose, and offering to pay the cost if it had been used for conveying an inhabitant of this district. The managers, however, would not undertake this, among other reasons, on the somewhat illogical grounds that it could not be efficiently done, and also that they had no power to enforce disinfection. No instance of a cab infected in this way has occurred, however, since this correspondence, but one or two that arose in former years entailed a very great deal of labour and time in tracing the vehicles, which were only found and disinfected after many hours, and after they had been used for other passengers. Such a thing might occur again, and though the cabman might be punished, yet disease would have meantime been spread. It would be very much better, therefore, to make sure of disinfecting it before it is allowed to leave the hospital. Water Supply. This district is supplied by two companies drawing their water from the Thames. The monthly reports of the Water Examiner show that the water is efficiently filtered and, as compared with the raw Thames water, is much improved as regards the number of micro-organisms, and generally as to its chemical composition. This latter is not always the case, however, as in some of the Reports it appears that the water delivered by these companies is little, if at all, better 26 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. chemically, than the unfiltered river water. At all times it is not a pure water, nor free from evidences of more or less polution. Furthermore, the water supplied by the Lambeth and Southwark and Vauxhall Companies does not always compare favourably with that supplied by other companies drawing their water from the same source— the Thames. This, at all events as regards the Southwark Company, is partly due to the want of adequate storage reservoir accommodation for the water, to allow it to settle before filtering it. The Lambeth Company has reservoirs large enough to hold 6 days supply and the Southwark and Vauxhall only 1.6 days. The Water Examiner states in his November report:— "On the whole, the results of the month, in the matter of water supply have tended to accentuate the necessity which exists for an increase in the capacity of the subsidence reservoirs which the companies referred to (including the two companies that supply this district) at present possess, and it is satisfactory to note that active steps are being taken in the direction indicated. "During the last session of Parliament the Southwark and Vauxhall Company obtained powers to raise capital for the purpose, amongst others, of constructing reservoirs, and considerable progress has been made in preliminary work, "The Lambeth Company are promoting a bill for the same purpose. "When the works in process, or contemplated, have been completed, the Lambeth Company will possess reservoirs for unfiltered water with a capacity equivalent to 21 days' average supply, and the Southwark and Yauxhall Company 15 days. The considerable increase in storage capacity indicated will, as a rule, enable these companies to close their intakes during the worst phases of the freshets which occur periodically, and cannot fail to lead to marked improvement in the quality of the water supplied during such periods."

Sanitary Legislation. The London Building Act, 1894, is a measure of much importance from the public health point of view. The particularly useful sections from this standpoint are those that relate to the provision ot airspace round buildings, the importance of which cannot be exaggerated. Part V. of the Act provides in a very elaborate and careful manner for open space in the rear of a house in proportion to its height so that future dwelling houses will be better supplied with fresh air and sunlight than some that have been built of late years. The question is of particular importance in a district such as this, where building operations are being carried on on a large scale. Other provisions of importance are those as to the relationship of dwelling houses and noxious trades, and the rules as to habitable rooms as to height and ventilation. Sanitary proceedings.

CLAPHAM. Population. The population in the middle of 1894, estimated in the usual way, is 46,380, being an increase of 843 over the previous year. Births and Birth-rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1,023, of which 513 were males and 510 females. This is a smaller number than in any year of the past decade, excepting the year 1890. The birth-rate was 22.05 per thousand, also exceptionally low and materially less than in any of the preceding ten years. The rate of natural increase, reckoned from the excess of births over deaths, was 11.25, whereas the decennial average was 10.47. Deaths and Death-rate. There were only 501 deaths in this sub-dislrict during 1894, a very small number indeed; 230 were of males and 271 of females. This number is 100 less than in 1893, and also less than in any of the previous years — out of these, too, 25 were of non-parishioners and occurred in the "Hostel of God" and British Home for incurables. If these deaths are excluded the death-rate becomes 1026, without such exclusion the rate is 10.8. The deaths of Clapham inhabitants that occurred in hospitals and institutions outside its borders are not included in this total, however. On referring to Table III. below, they are seen to be 126 in number. Adding these we get a total of 602, giving a rate of 12.9. This compares with a cor- Parish of Clapham. 33 responding rate of 15.8 in 1893. It is a very low figure and shows how healthy a year 1894 was as regards climatic conditions.

The proportion of the deaths at the various ago groups to the total deaths was as follows:— Under 5 years 34.3 per cent. From 5 to 65 years 40.9 „ Above 65 years 24.8 „ Comparing this with previous years it is found that the percentage under 5 years is less, while that of the group over 65 is increased, the intermediate group being about the average. The Infantile death-rate was 113. That is the number of deaths of infants under 1 year of age per thousand births. The corresponding rate for 1893 was 146, and in 1892 it was 143. Social Position.

The 38 deaths from diseases of this class that occurred in out-lying institutions (see table III.) should be added, however, the total thus being 111 and the death-rate 2.4.

There were only 2 cases in Clapham reported to me, however; one of them, a child aged two, was returned at once from the wharf to which she was taken for removal to the hospital ships, as being a case of measles. 40 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The other, who was taken ill on January 11th, was a letter sorter in the General Post Office, and was 22 years of age. There were stated to have been previous cases where he was employed, but I was not able to definitely trace the cause of infection. He was promptly removed to the hospital ship and no further case occurred. Scarlet Fever.—The notifications were 199 compared with 303 in the previous year, showing a distinct diminution, but still a large amount of the disease present. I give the numbers reported in each month:— January 19. July 11. February 13. August 6. March 23. September 17. April 32. October 18. May 30. November 10. June 11. December 9. This shows that the cases were most numerous in the earlier months of the year. 73 patients were removed to hospital, or 37 per cent., a distinct drop in the number removed from the previous years. There were 9 deaths, giving a case mortality of 4.5 per cent., the disease, therefore, was of a mild type. In connection with the spread of scarlet fever it cannot be doubted that schools, in spite of the precautions that are taken to make the teachers aware of the existence of cases of disease, and the efforts that are made to prevent the return of children to school before They are themselves free of infection, and their homes have been disinfected, have still a responsibility to bear. Between the ages of 3 and 14 there were 151 cases of scarlet fever, whilst there were 48 only at all other ages. The small number of cases notified in August, during most of which month the elementary schools are having holidays, may not unlikely have a similar significance. During the very great prevalence of scarlet fever in 1893 41 Parish of Clapham. there was great difficulty in effecting the prompt removal of patients owing to the want of sufficient hospital accommodation. This difficulty was not experienced to the same extent in 1894. Diphtheria.—The number of cases reported was 125, and 1 of membranous croup, against 108 and 6 in 1893. The increase was not, therefore, so marked as between 1892 and 1893, when the number nearly doubled. The number removed to the isolation hospitals was 61. The number of deaths was 39, giving a case mortality of 209 per cent. Amongst those removed to hospital it was 39.3, and in those remaining at home 23 per cent. The mortality has thus been very great, greater even than in 1893. The reasons for its increasing prevalence in Clapham, as in the metropolis generally, are, therefore, of very great importance. With regard to insanitary conditions, it cannot be said that generally anything very greatly amiss has been found at the homes of the sufferers. Out of the 126 cases, in 31 houses some drain defect or other unhealthy condition was found, in some instances it was dampness, but often it was not of a serious character. In the other 92 houses no fault could be found. Then, too, the cases have not occurred especially in those streets where there is most crowding of the people together, and where, from the character of the population, the surroundings are most dirty, in fact, the disease seems to have rather avoided certain areas of thi3 character. Another opinion, now commonly held, is that diphtheria spread is chiefly due to direct infection from patient to patient without the intervention of insanitary surroundings. There can be no doubt that there is much truth in this opinion. It is, therefore, considered highlyprobable that the congregation of children in schools, especially, of course, the public elementary schools, has 42 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. much to do with causing its spread. The ages of those reported as suffering from diphtheria is, therefore, of interest. Taking the school age as from 3 to 14, there were 74 cases between these ages, 22 were under 3 years of age, and 29 above, the age of 14. The proportion among those of school age to the total number of cases was not so high as in previous years, but still there is seen to be a special incidence since it includes over 59 per cent, of the total cases. The number reported each month is given below:— January 10. July 10. February 10. August 8. March 12. September 12. April 11. October 9. May 10. November 13. June 12. December 8. The cases were, therefore, remarkably evenly distributed throughout the year. No very marked difference is noticeable for August, the time of the school holidays. Enteric Fever.—There were 34 cases reported as against 31 in each of the 2 preceding years, 3 cases of continued fever were also notified There were 6 deaths from enteric and 1 from continued fever. Here, as in the case of diphtheria, the houses were thoroughly overhauled and the defects found in the drains, &c. were remedied. During the later months of the year there was exceptional prevalence of enteric fever in some parts of London, especially the West End, but that was not the case in Clapham. It was suggested that in some instances this was due to eating oysters that had been fed in sewage polluted water. In some of the cases reported here it was found that the patients had eaten oysters, as indeed, was most likely, but I did not attach much importance to the few instances discovered. 4-3 Parish of Clapharn. At the end of March and in April I noticed that several cases of enteric fever occurred, all getting their milk from the same vendor in Lambeth. I communicated with the medical officer of health for Lambeth, who informed me that the same was the case in his district, and that the supply was to be discontinued from the particular source apparently causing the illness. I was afterwards informed that a tank of water was found to be highly polluted with organic matter; but t hat it was only intended to be used for washing the carts, though it had also been used, unknown to the proprietor, for washing the milk churns, and no doubt some of it found its way into the milk. The tank was removed and the epidemic ceased. There were 7 cases in Clapham, in April, traced to this milk. Most of the district supplied with this milk was in Lambeth, and I understand the cases that occurred there were very numerous. Puerperal Fever.—3 cases were notified ; there were no deaths however. Erysipelas.—54 cases were notified during the year. Measles was the cause of 17 deaths, a less number than in any year since 1890. It is probable that there was but little of this disease last year, but of that, of course, I have no certain information. When information of measles has been given me, all the children in the house have been prevented from going to school until sufficient time has elapsed to ensure that none of them are incubating the disease. I think if that could be universally applied, much would result in lessening the spread of measles, and the advantage of being able to do so would, I think, be the great gain of the notification of measles, Whooping Cough caused only 12 deaths, less than in any of the 10 preceding years. 44 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Diarrhoea caused only 11 deaths in Clapliam and 3 in out-lying institutions. This small number, less than in any of the ten preceding years, was no doubt in consequence of the cool summer experienced in 1894. Influenza 11 deaths were referred to this cause, also 1 in an out-lying institution. This is a smaller number than in any year since 1890, when it was first met with as a cause of death in recent years. There was not any great prevalence of it in 1894 till quite at the end of the year, when the cases began to increase, leading up to the epidemic we are experiencing in the early months of this present year.

The above Table gives the number of deaths for the last 10 years, and the last columns show whether those for 1894 were above or below the decennial average corrected for increase of population. Cancer and other Tumours—Are seen to be in excess of the average by 16. Of these deaths 13 were of nonparishioners, and took place in the Home for the Dying, so that there is no great increase under this head. Tubercular Diseases show a marked decrease from the average. This is satisfactory as an indication of improved health conditions, especially as a number of deaths from consumption, included here, took place in the same Home for the Dying. 47 Parish of Clapham. Nervous Diseases—Are also much below the average, while circulatory show a slight excess. Respiratory Diseases—Are again much below. This is to be partly attributed to the exceptionally mild character and absence of cold east winds of the early spring months, which, together with the cold summer, were the climatic conditions that made 1894 so healthy a one. Under the head of Premature Birth, Low Vitality, &c., there is a fall which as far as it goes is satisfactory. The fall under the head of Violence should also be noted. Inquests. Forty inquests have been held during the year, the following being the verdicts:— Natural Causes Males. Females Total. 13 11 24 Accidental ., Falls 2 5 Suffocation in Bed with Parents 2 Suffocation from Gas 1 Run over by Train 1 — — 11 Suicide Strychnia poisoning 1 1 Open Verdicts Found Dead 1 Found Drowned. 1 Suffocation probably from Fire, no evidence to show how caused 1 Carbolic poisoning, no evidence to show how caused 1 4 21 19 40 In addition 6 deaths were registered, on the authority of the Coroner, without inquests being held. This number is less than last year, and shows satisfactorily a progressive decrease year by year. 48 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Water Supply. Some remarks as to the public water supply will be found in the general report for the district. There still exist in Clapham certain private wells from which persons draw their domestic supplies. Considering the closeness of the houses in the parish it is certain that the subsoil must be considerably polluted with organic matter, and that, therefore, well-water must be highly dangerous, if not at the moment of analysis so highly polluted as to be obviously unfit for consumption. The water of 7 wells, the sole water supply to as many houses, was analysed during the year, and in 5 instances I was able to advise that the owners should be required to lay on the companies' water, which was done without recourse to magisterial proceedings. In another instance the owner promised to lay on the water. The wells, of course, remain, but are not likely to be much used as it is easier to draw water from a tap than to pump it. Disinfection. At present the steam disinfection of clothing, &c. is done by a contractor, with whose methods no fault is to be found, but it has been decided, I am glad to say, to erect an apparatus for Clapham. There is a difficulty, in obtaining the site as it is not possible to put it up in the Board's yard in the Wandsworth Road. As soon as the site is obtained the provision of a disinfecting station is to be taken in hand. During the year, 437 rooms in 332 houses have been fumigated by burning sulphur by this department, and in 18 houses the fumigation has been carried out under the supervision of the medical man in attendance, and certified by him. 305 lots of bedding, clothing, &c. have been disinfected by super-healed steam by the coutractor, and one lot of bedding has been burnt, 49 Parish of Clapham. 305 notices were served to strip walls and cleanse 338 rooms, and in 108 cases the work has been carried out by the Board. The sum of £33 has been expended in the purchase of disinfectants, £359 in the disinfection of bedding, &c., and £113 in cleansing and stripping rooms. Unsound Food. 1 box of herrings, 1 box of melons, 1 basket of strawberries and 1 trunk of mackerel have been distroyed, being unfit for food No proceedings followed as the respective owners did not attempt to sell to the public. Underground Rooms. During the year, 10 underground rooms separately occupied were regularly inspected. Workshops. 49 were inspected and were found generally satisfactory, 3 required cleansing and 3 required additional water-closet accommodation. The necessary work was in all instances carried out. Smoke Nuisances. 5 cases came under notice, and 3 notices were served: so far these have been complied with. The cow-houses and slaughter-houses were inspected in September, and no objection was raised to the renewal of the licenses. The Bakehouses, 50 in number, were inspected twice during the year. Lime-washing was required in 4 instances in May and 23 in October. General Sanitary Proceedings. During the year, 4,743 houses and premises were inspected and the total number of nuisances dealt with amounted to 5,305, of these 4,464 were abated under notice, and 841 without. 1,900 notices were served, viz., 1,635 Preliminary and 265 Statutory. E 50 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The table on page 29 gives a statement of the nuisances dealt with that can be conveniently classified. In addition 1,850 nuisances were dealt with besides those in the table, and the following were some of the works executed to remedy them :—676 new water-closets have been fixed in the place of old apparatus, and 233 old closet apparatus have been disconnected from the drinking water cistern, 21 closet apartments have been ventilated, 3 closets rebuilt, 3 additional closets built, and 2 old closets abolished, 170 new soil pipes have been fixed, 65 soil pipes ventilated and 20 soil pipes repaired, 57 leaky water fittings repaired, 11 separate drinking water supplies laid on, 9 new cisterns constructed, 11 waste pipes repaired, 8 ventilating pipes repaired, 24 leaky sinks repaired, 5 new sinks fixed, 2 buildings improperly occupied, 124 infringements of the Bye-laws, 106 manure receptacles constructed, 2 slop sinks provided, 10 cases of stagnant water, 7 cases of water in basement, 6 basements have been concreted to keep out damp, 32 damp houses, 10 basements ventilated, 63 floors repaired, 45 walls repaired, 31 ceilings repaired, 4 staircases repaired, 2 flights of front steps repaired, 42 windows repaired, 12 fire-grates repaired, 3 private roads made up and repaired, new urinal built, privy abolished, 3 cases of rats, 1 case of dirty bedding; animals kept so as to be a nuisance:—horses 2, dogs 4, fowls 4, pigeons 3, ducks 2, goat 1, geese 1. The drains of 302 houses and premises have been reconstructed, 362 inspection chambers have been built and 394 new ventilating pipes fixed; and of these 100 new drains, 140 inspection chambers, and 128 ventilating pipes were constructed without notices, the owners at once recognising the necessity of the work. Housing of Working Classes Act. In 9 cases premises were found to be in so bad a state that it appeared desirable to proceed under Part II. of this Act. 51 Parish of Clapham. They were as follows :— Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Eastons Cottages.—Palled down. Nos. 108, .110, 112, Larkhall Lane.—In hand. Proceedings'. Thirteen summonses were issued in connection with nuisances, and of these 9 were withdrawn, the necessary work having been carried out; and, in the remaining 4, the magistrate made orders for the work to be carried out, and in 1 caso a fine of £3 and costs was inflicted. Three summonses were issued for infringements of the Bye-Laws, in two cases the work was carried out and the summonses were withdrawn, and in the other the defendant was fined £1 and costs. Three summonses were issued for exposing goods on the Public Highway, in 1 case the magistrate inflicted a fine of forty shillings and costs, and in the other 2, five shillings and costs each. In conclusion, I am pleased to add that Inspectors Fairchild, Nurcombe, and Crabbe have all done excellent work in this as in former years. OLIVER FIELD, M D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Clapham PUTNEY & ROEHAMPTON. The estimated population of the sub-district of Putney and Roehampton for the year 1894 is 19,158, being an increase by 466 of the population in the previous year. Birth and Death Rates. During the year 455 births (244 males and 211 femels) were registered, giving a birthrate of 23 7 per 1,000. 190 deaths were registered, giving us a death-rate of 9.9, which is by far the lowest I have ever had to record. The difference between the birth and death-rates, which gives the rate of natural increase in the population, was 13.8. It is the highest I have had to record, with the exception of the year 1891. A reference to table I. shows the respective birth and death-rates during the last ten years : — TABLE I. Birth and Death Rates. YEARS. Births. Birth-rate. Deaths from all Causes.

Deaths in Out-lying Institutions. It might have been inferred that the remarkably low death-rate within the district was possibly due to the fact that a greater number of deaths occurred in hospitals outside the district. This, however, is not the case. Only 25 deaths occurred in these out-lying institutions as compared with 43 during the previous year and with 45 in 1892. These 25 deaths are tabulated in table II. 10 occurred in the Union Infirmary, and 12 in general and special hospitals and 3 in those of the Asylums Board. TABLE II. Deaths in Outlying Institutions.

General Mortality. I have followed the usual plan in table III. of classifying the deaths under the headings of sex, age and social position. The relative percentage of deaths under the different social positions were as follows :— Nobili y and gentry .5 per cent. Professional classes 15.3 „ Trading classes 30.0 „ Industrial classes 54.2 „ Ages at Death.—The proportion of deaths at different ages was as folic ws :— Under 1 year 25.3 per cent. From 1 to 5 years 6.8 „ From 5 to 65 years 43.6 „ Over 65 years 24.3 „ Compared wi:h the preceding year there is a marked diminution in the number of deaths during the age from 1 to 5 years. In the present year these deaths constitute 6.8 per cent. of the whole, while during the previous twelve months they were 15.8 per cent. Infantile Mentality. — Last year I had the pleasure of reporting that the infantile mortality was much below the average. In the year 1892 there were 163 deaths of infants under 12 months for every 1,000 births.

During 1893 it was nearly double. The difference is accounted for by the great diminution in the mortality from diphtheria and whooping cough. 59 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampion. The following table gives us useful information in regard to the number of infectious cases' notified to me during the year, the number of such cases removed to hospital and the mortality resulting from them :— No. of cases notified.

Influenza—directly or indirectly, was the cause of 6 deaths. These cases occurred during the first two months of the year, and were a continuation of the epidemic prevalent at the end of 1893. Scarlet Fever.—Only 53 cases were notified during the year, and of these only 1 proved fatal, showing the very mild character of the disease. 50 of the cases occurred during the first three quarters of the year. During the last three months the notifications dropped to 6. It is noteworthy that the Asylums' Board Hospitals are being more taken advantage of than in previous years. 58 per 60 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. cent, of the cases of scarlet fever were removed to hospital compared with 41 per cent, during the year 1893. The removal of cases has been effected promptly, and this has doubtless had the effect of cutting short the epidemic. Diphtheria.—I am glad to say that the epidemic from which we suffered so severely in 1893, has practically disappeared. 17 cases were notified during the first quarter, and only 4 in the last. During the twelve months 32 cases were notified to me, so that more than a half of the total number were notified during the first quarter of the year. During 1893, 69 cases were notified, and most of these during the last 4 or 5 months of the year. The epidemic began in August, 1893, and continued on during the first quarter of 1894. I have reason to believe that the sanitary measures resorted to had an effect in controlling the spread of the disease. In the area principally affected, which I mentioned in my last report, a thorough inspection was made from house to house of the conditions of the house drains and water supply, with the result that leaky house drains were found to exist in many cases. Those defective drains have been relaid and tested at considerable inconvenience and expense to the occupiers and owners of the property. I am convinced, however, that it has been well worth all the outlay and inconvenience caused. In my opinion there is nothing more dangerous to health than the existence of leaky drains, especially where they run underneath the house itself. The subsoil under and around the house becomes gradually sodden with sewage matter. There it gradually decomposes, producing most offensive and noxious gases. In the winter time, especially, when houses are artificially warmed, and the surface of the earth is cold or frozen, they must necessarily exert a considerable suction action on the subsoil air, which is, therefore drawn into the houses to the great danger of the occupants thereof. I cannot help thinking there is more 61 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. danger from this cause than from a direct escape of sewer air into the house. Another precaution taken I have found of considerable benefit. All school teachers have been directed to watch any children complaining of sore throat, and to prevent them attending school unless they can produce a doctor's certificate to the effect that they are not suffering from anything of an infectious character. This is a measure I consider of the greatest importance, more especially at times of epidemic sore throat. Typhoid Fever.—16 cases of typhoid fever were notified to me, of which 3 proved fatal. 13 of these cases occurred during the fourth quarter of the year, 2 in the third quarter and 1 in the first quarter. Five of these cases were removed to hospital. This disease was unusually prevalent over London during the last quarter of the year, affecting to a very great extent the upper classes of society. It has, I think, been undoubtedly shown that many cases were the result of eating oysters. Of the 3 fatal cases which occurred in this sub-district, 1 of them at least was, in my opinion, due to this cause. It was the case of a temperate and careful living man. No sanitary defects were found in the house. He was not a water drinker. About ten days before the symptons appeared, on going up to market in the morning he partook freely of oysters, and by a process of exclusion 1 am driven to conclude that this was the only probable source of infection. Diarrlicea and Dysentery was the cause of death in 6 cases which occurred during the summer months in young children. 62 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. TABLE VI.

Sanitary Work.—A classified table of the various sanitary operations will be found in the general summary at the beginning of our report (table XIII.) As in former years, a large amount of useful work has been carried out, which cannot but have a beneficial effect on the sanitary conditions of our district. As in former years a large amount of time has been devoted to the ordinary house to house inspection. This work, as I have stated in former reports, is confined to the poorer class of property. Better class property is only inspected if there is any special reason to suspect the existence of any nuisance or insanitary condition, or if there is any infectious disease therein. The various sanitary operations classified in table XIII. are in most cases the result of the regular house to house inspection. It is during this visitation that most of the sanitary defects are discovered. During the year there were 3,295 houses and premises inspected, 901) preliminary and 109 statutory notices served. In only three cases were summonses issued to enforce orders of the Board, one was withdrawn, the necessary works having been carried out. In the second case, the magistrate's prohibition order was obtained, and the third was fined £1 and 3s. costs for contravention of prohibition order. 77 rooms were disinfected after infectious disease, 64 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. and in no case did infectious disease recur after disinfection had been carried out. 172 water cisterns have been re-covered, or repaired, or cleansed. In reference to water cisterns, under the new bye-laws of the Board, made under the Public Health Act, it is now the duty of all householders to have their cisterns thoroughly cleaned out every six months, and to have a proper fitting cover to same if there is any danger of the water being polluted by being left uncovered. There were 763 sanitary operations under the heading of unclassified nuisances, these included :— 97 waste pipes of bath trapped. 148 waste pipes of sink trapped. 68 waste pipes of lavatory trapped. 156 soil pipes repaired. 144 ventilating pipes repaired. 11 water closet apparatus renewed. 16 new manure receptacles provided. 107 water closets disconnected from drinking water cisterns and a separate supply laid on. The quantities of the various substances used for disinfecting purposes were as follows: — 45 gallons of carbolic acid containing 95 per cent, of tar acids were used. 15 gallons of cresol, 20 cwts. of carbolic powder, containing 15 per cent, of carbolio acid. 11 cwt. of carbolic powder, containing acid sulphates. 1¾ cwt. of roll sulphur. Workshop and Factory Act.—Under this act all workshops have been duly inspected. It was found that three required cleaning and lime washing, and there was one case of overcrowding. 65 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. Lists of out-workers have been obtained from all workshops employing the same, and notices have been forwarded to the various authorities of the districts where they reside. The order made by the Home Secretary in 1892, under this act, has been to a very large extent inoperative as such a large proportion of outworkers resides outside the boundary of the district from which they receive their work. In our case we have endeavoured to carry out the order. The working of it has been, however entirely one-sided, as we have not received a single notice from any outside authority, of any outworkers residing in our district, and we know there must be many such. All the bake-houses have been inspected twice during the year, and were found in a satisfactory condition with the exception of 5 cases in which notices were served, and the necessary cleaning done. All the cow-houses and slaughter-houses were inspected in the autumn, and no objection was taken to the renewal of their licenses. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.—Under this Act we have been able to deal with a group of houses situated in Gardners Lane, called Wickam's Rents. These tenements were both structurally and sanitarily so bad, that steps were taken under the act to have them closed. They have now been nearly all demolished, and new houses are being erected on the site. Under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, I received only 1 application for a certificate of exemption from the Inhabited House Duty. I inspected the block of houses referred, and was able to give the required certificate. 66 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The shelter in the parish wharf has not again been required. I have again to thank all concerned in the sanitary work of the parish for their kind co-operation and assistance, and the Putney Committee for the support I have invariably received at their hands in regard to all matters it has been my duty to bring to their notice.

I have great pleasure in being able to give a highlyfavourable report of the public health of Streatham during the year 1894. The death-rate is the lowest I have had to record during the Decennium. The Infantile Mortality is nearly 30 per thousand below that of the previous year, and the Zymotic Mortality is lower than it has been for several years. Population. The estimated population for the parish during the year 1894 based upon the usual theory is 49084, and throughout the following statistics, this will be taken as the basis of calculation, although as stated in former reports this estimate is probably below the actual population having regard to the extensive building operations now being carried on. Births and Birth Rate. The number of births registered during the year under report was 1,103, being 578 of males and 585 of females. The birth-rate calculated upon the foregoing estimate of population is 23.7 per 1,000, being exactly similar to that for the year 1892. Natural Increase. The excess of births over deaths was 671, 317 of males and 354 of females, producing a rate of 13.6 per 1000 of the population, which is higher than for the past few years. f 2 68 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Deaths and Death Rate. During the year, 492 deaths were registered as occurring within the district, 261 being of males, and 231 of females, giving a death-rate of 10.0 per 1000, being the lowest death-rate recorded during the past ten years. To arrive however at the corrected death-rate, the deaths of non-parishioners occuring within the district (44 in number) must be excluded and those of parishioners occuring outside (63) included, representing a a total of 511, and producing a corrected death-rate of parishioners 10.2 per 1000 of the population.

Infantile Death-rate. The deaths of infants under one year of age numbered 109 or 93.7 per 1,000 of the registered births. Compared with previous years this is highly favourable and would indicate that greater care is observed in the management of infants. The annexed Table contrasts the infantile death-rate for the past four years. No. of deaths of infants under 1 year of age.

The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class yield a percentage of 15.2 upon the death from all causes. The seven principal diseases in this class give a death rate of 0.9 per 1,000 of the population. 76 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Small Pox. Notwithstanding the prevalence of Small Pox in the Metropolis, in which during the previous year we participated to a certain extent, yet owing to the prompt measures that were taken in the various cases that came under notice, the disease was arrested and no cases have occurred since November, 1893. Measles The mortality from Measles was higher than in the previous year. Whether this was due to the greater prevalence of the disease or to its more fatal character it is impossible to say, Measles not being a notifiable disease. Scarlet Fever. The epidemic of Scarlet Fever which began in 1892 and increased in intensity during 1893, has been greatly on the decline during the year under report, the disease being still of a very mild type, as indicated by the low mortality of two out of the two hundred and thirty cases notified. Both deaths occurred at the house of the patients. The low death-rate is undoubtedly in no small measure attributable to the greater care and attention consequent upon compulsory notification. In former days a large mortality often followed mild epidemics of the disease from want of this very care and isolation. One hundred and forty-five of the cases were removed to hospital. Diphtheria. During the year, forty-two cases of Diphtheria were notified, fifteen of which were removed to hospital. Ten deaths occurred from the disease eight of which were at the homes of the patients and two in hospital. Although the number of notifications was nearly fifty per cent. below that of the previous year, the mortality was somewhat higher. 77 Parish of Streatham. Diphtheria has become epidemic in London, its mode of origin and propogation is occupying the attention of Sanitarians. There can he little doubt that it is disseminated in the main by personal infection. I came to this conclusion in the year 1888, when there was a considerable prevalence of the disease and a higher mortality than in any year of the decennium, and reported thereon to the Local Committee. I was then very strongly impressed with the need there was of a longer isolation of diphtheria cases than was then deemed necessary. I believe, in the Metropolitan Asylums Board fever Hospitals, Bacteriological examination of cases of diphtheria is being carried out largely, and patients are not sent home until the diphtheria bacillus can no longer be found in the secretions of the throat, and I understand this often requires six or eight weeks to accomplish. This mode of enquiry will, I think, ultimately prove to be very beneficial. I am strongly of opinion that the system of rendering water-tight all drains will, in years to come, tend to eradicate the disease. Typhoid Fever and Whooping Cough. The mortality from both these diseases did not exceed the decennial average. The total number of deaths being four and seventeen respectively. Here however, in common with the Metropolis, the number of cases of typhoid seems to be on the increase, thirtythree cases having occurred during the year. Diarrhœa. The mortality from Diarrhœa was decidedly below the average, and the diminished prevalence of the disease was undoubtedly consequent upon the low temperature, and unusually heavy rainfall during the summer months. Cholera. During the year although no cases of true Asiatic Cholera occurred, a case of sudden death was suspected as being due to this cause, but subsequent 78 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. enquiries and post mortem examination proved the contrary. A few details of the case will no doubt however be of interest, and they are here appended. On Sunday, 26th August, 1894, having received a notification of the case, I at once proceeded to the residence of the deceased—Cowpers Row, Brixton Hill —and ascertained that death took place the preceding night with every evidence of choleraic collapse. In accordance with my instructions the body was at once conveyed to the mortuary and surrounded with disinfectants, and the premises disinfected. The occupants of the premises and those adjoining were kept in quarantine pending further enquiries and examination. Acting upon a communication received from me Dr. Young, Assistant Medical Officer of Health, London County Council called, and together with myself visited the premises and subsequently the Mortuary, where a post mortem examination was made, and material despatched to Dr. Klein for bacteriological examination who declared the result to be "negative.'' The post mortem examination revealed a congested condition of internal organs, due probably to a severe chill received two days before be died. The following table gives the number of notified diseases, the number of cases removed to Hospital, and the number of deaths that took place, in both the Sub-district and the Hospital. 79 Parish of Streatham.

Deaths from respiratory diseases contributed 82 deaths to the total mortality, compared with 117 during the previous year. There was also considerable decrease in the number of deaths from Nervous, Circulatory, and Generative Diseases, and compared with past years they were much below the average. Ages at Death. The number of deaths under one year of age was 109; under five, 163; and under twenty-five, 199. They respectively formed 22-l, and 10-4 per cent, of all deaths. There was a decrease of 3-4 per cent, in the proportion of deaths of infants under one year. 81 Parish of Streatham. Senile Decay. From old age unassociated with disease 54 deaths were registered. Of these, 31 were males, and 23 females; yielding a percentage of 10.9 upon all deaths. The total number of deaths at 65 and upwards was 16S. Of these, 122 were over 70; 45 were 80 years and upwards. Below is a tabulated statement of deaths at high ages, with the age at different periods, and the sex of the deceased, composing 24.7 per cent of the total deaths. TABLE VII. Age. Males. Females.

Twenty four inquests were held, sixteen upon males and eight upon females, with the following verdicts:— I. Natural Syncope 4 Digestive 1 Erysipelas 1—6 G 82 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. II. Violence:— (a) Accidental Falls 4 Injury to Foot 1 Burns 2 Suffocation 1 Run over by Train 3 Perforation of Stomach 1- 12 (b) Suicide Hanging 2 Bun over by Train 1- 3 (c) Murder Strangulation 1- 1 III. Open Verdicts Injuries to Head 1 Found Dead 1- 2 24 Uncertified Deaths. Twelve cases of sudden death were submitted to the Coroner in which inquests were deemed unnecessary. Seven were of males and five of females. The causes of death were as follows:— Apoplexy 1 Heart Disease 2 Scarlet Fever 1 Premature Birth 3 Old Age 1 Rheumatism 1 Perforation of Intestine 1 Asthma 1 Convulsions 1 12 The Sanitary operations of the year are given in Table XIII. of the combined Report. The number of house to house inspections was 1843, an increase of over 700 upon the work of the previous year. As I had occasion 83 Parish of Streatham. to remark last year the Inspectors have to devote a considerable amount of their time to the water testing of new drains in accordance with the recent regulations of the Board, and such an increase as before noted in house to house inspection is very creditable to them. I think it is high time that there should be a special drain Inspector, or Inspectors for the testing of drains to new houses, the present staff being retained to execute the numerous duties imposed by the Public Health Act. There were 7,411 drain inspections made, the water test was applied in 3,364 cases, the number of drains tested in old houses was 420. First notices were served in 1047 instances to remedy defects and abate nuisances (an increase of nearly 200 compared with the previous year), in 68 instances only was it found necessary to serve second notices. 322 rooms in 241 houses have been disinfected after infectious disease with sulphurous acid gas. In 128 instances the bedding was stoved and in 2 cases burned. Drains were relaid or reconstructed in 383 instances, 482 new ventilating pipes and no less than 1094 syphon traps were fixed, being a large increase upon the work of previous years. The table gives further details and references will shew the large amount of sanitary work that has been carried out. Police Court Investigations. During the year several summonses were issued for contraventions of the various Acts and Byelaws governing Public Health. In two cases houses were without proper water supply and in one case the requirements not being complied with the magistrate granted a closing order; a house without a proper and sufficient supply of water, being G 2 84 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. deemed unfit for human habitation under the Public Health (London) Act, 1894. For slaughtering sheep upon unlicensed premises, an offender was convicted and fined. An owner (who was also occupier of the premises) was fined for obstructing the Sanitary Inspector during the execution of his duties. In one case of defective drainage, the premises at the date of service of the summons were empty. The magistrate however inflicted penalties and made an order for the work to be executed before the premises were reoccupied. For failing to give necessary notice before commencing Sanitary works, two builders were each fined 40s. and costs. For failing to comply with the order of the magistrate in a case of defective drains, the defendant was fined £5 and costs. Two summonses were issued against the owner and driver of a van, for removing fish offal, &c. in an improperly constructed receptacle, and penalties inflicted. To abate nuisances arising from animals being kept in an unfit place, an accumulation of offensive matter, and an improper receptacle for manure, &c, three summonses were issued against a farmer, and penalties and costs amounting to £5 6s. 0d. inflicted. In several other cases the Board's requirements having been complied with the summonses were withdrawn upon payment of costs. 85 Parish of Streatham. Bakehouses. The whole of the bakehouses were inspected during the year, and the necessary cleansing and limewhiting duly carried out. I personally inspected two of these bakehouses—one of the oldest and also one of the newest in the parish, in the former case general insanitary conditions prevailed, the bakehouse being uncleanly and the yard unpaved; In the other case a sleeeping apartment communicated directly with the bakehouse-a contravention of he Bakehouse Regulations. In both cases however, my requirements were satisfactorily complied with, and further action was rendered unnecessary. Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses. During the year the Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have been duly inspected, and in no case did I see occasion to oppose the renewal of the licenses, which were granted in all cases by the London County Council who are the licensing authority. Mortuary The new Mortuary in the Parish Yard, High Street, has been of very great service. No less than 26 bodies having been received there during the year, a proof of the necessity of such a building. Wells. In my last Report I referred to pending proceedings for the enforced closure of a highly polluted well, the proceedings terminated with an unsatisfactory result, the Magistrate deciding that the well in question need not be closed as it was only intended to be used for the purpose of washing carts belonging to the occupier of the premises (water for domestic purposes being laid on from the Company's mains). I have reason to believe however, that this well is used by many people in the locality for domestic purposes, and in my opinion continues to be a source of danger. In conclusion I have to accord my thanks to the 86 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Sanitary Staff, their attention and able assistance has been invaluable, and again my cordial thanks are due to the Streatham Local Committee for the consideration and support I have always received at their hands. F. F. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health for Streatham. TOOTING. The estimated population for the year 1894 is 5,676 and upon this are based the various rates of mortality, &c. Births and Birth Rate. During the year, 149 births were registered, of which 81 were males and 68 females. The birth-rate is equal to 26.2 per 1,000, of the population, and is the lowest recorded since 1890. Deaths, Death Rate and Rate of Natural Increase. 204 deaths were registered during the year as occurring within the district, giving a death-rate of 35.9 per 1,000. The death-rate would, however, be unduly augmented were not an allowance made for the deaths of 117 non-parishioners, which occurred within the district, and will not be included in the calculations, those of parishioners dying outside the district being included, producing a corrected total of 103, or a rate of 18.1 per 1,000 of the population. The large number of deaths of non-parishioners within the parish is due to the recent opening of the Fountain Hospital, which receives patients suffering from infectious diseases from all parts of the Metropolis. The following Table compares the births, birth-rates, deaths, death-rates and rates of natural increase during the past six years:— 88 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. TABLE 1.

Small Pox.—No cases of this disease have occurred during the year in the sub-district, although epidemic in some parts of the Metropolis. Scarlet Fever.—Sixty notifications of Scarlet Fever were received during the year, 54 of the cases were removed to hospital.* The deaths from this disease appear abnormal owing to deaths occurring in the Asylums Board Hospital as already explained, and for which notifications are not received. Other Zymotics.—From diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas and typhoid and continued fever, in all, 28 cases occurred, 9 of which were removed to hospital. Sanitary Operations. The usual table of sanitary operations is included in the combined report, table XIII. During the year 25 cases were investigated by the magistrate, of these 13 were issued against an owner of house property at Salvador. In 11 cases the requirements of the Board were carried out, but in the other two the houses were closed and afterwards pulled down. In 4 cases of defective drains the necessary orders were made. Two summonses were issued to prohibit the shooting of slops, and the necessary orders obtained, penalties being inflicted in the one case, the defendant having previously been cautioned. For removing fish offal within hours prohibited by the bye-laws of the London County Council, six summonses were issued. During the year one well has been closed, the water 96 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. obtainable from the same being regarded as unfit for domestic purposes. Taking a general survey of the mortality for the year, the death-rate compares favourably with previous years. C. de LISLE BROCK, Medical Officer of Health for Tooting. 97 WANDSWORTH. Population. The population of the sub-district for the year 1894, estimated in the usual way, amounted to 55,175, or an increase of 2,753. Births and Birth-rate. During the year there were registered 1,628 births, 810 of males and 818 of females. This shows an increase of 22 from last year, the male births have, however, decreased by 37, while the female births have increased by 59. The average for the last 10 years corrected for increase of population was 1849. The birth-rate was 32.59 per 1,000, an increase of .64 per 1,000 as compared with 1893, but is lower than the decennial average by 4.98 per 1,000. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths was 20.96 per 1,000. Deaths and Death-rate. During the year the deaths of 398 males and 370 females were registered, making a total of 768. This is 52 less than 1893 and 165 less than the corrected decennial average. The death-rate calculated from the above was 13.91 per 1,000, but a correction has to be made for the deaths belonging to other parishes which took place in the following public institutions in this district. The total number of deaths to be deducted is 151, 97 of these occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum; 20 in the Workhouse; 12 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables; 12 in the Prison; 9 in the Cottage Home, Burntwood Lane; and 2 in St. Peter's Hospital. No deaths occurred in the Patriotic Asylum for Girls during the year. Corrected for the above institutions, the death-rate was 11.63 per 1,000, which is 4.28 below the mean rate for the preceding 10 years. H 98 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The following Table shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, deathrate corrected and uncorrected, and the rate of natural increase for 1894, as well as for the 10 preceding years. TABLE I.

The true mortality of the district can only be ascertained, if the deaths of parishioners in out-lying institutions be added, thus necessitating another correction. The following Table shows the deaths from all causes, from zymotic diseases, and from other diseases which occurred in these out-lying institutions. The total number of such deaths was 175, fourteen more than occurred in 1893. 112 of these occurred in the Union Infirmary,50 in general and special Hospitals, and 13 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 99 Parish of Wandsworth.

The above 175 deaths have therefore to be added, giving a further corrected total of 792, which may be taken as the true death roll of the sub-district. The doath-rate calculated from this would be 14-93, while in 1893 this coripcted death-rate was 18-43, a difference of 3-50 per 1,000. This represents a saving of 185 lives, as to make the death-rate of 1894 equal to that of 1893, that number would require to be added.

An examination of the above Table shows that the only zymotic disease which was above the average was measles, an epidemic of which was prevalent in April, May and June. The other zymotic diseases all show a decrease, and are all below the corrected average. The zymotic death-rate was 2'30 per 1,000, '24 per 1,000 under last year, and *5 per 1,000 less than the decennial average. If influenza, from which 13 deaths resulted be excluded, the zymotic death-rate would be only 2'04 per 1,000. To obtain the true zymotic death-rate, the same corrections as were applied to the general death-rate must be used. In the internal institutions only 1 death occurred from diarrhoea, 3 from puerperal fever and 1 from erysipelas. While in outlying institutions 19 deaths from zymotic diseases occurred, 14 deaths must therefore be added to 126, giving a true death roll of 110. Calculated from this the zymotic death-rate for the year was 2'64, or, if influenza be not included, of 2-39 per 1,000. Last year the same rates were 3'3 and 3*02 per 1,000. Small-pox. No cases of this disease occurred in the district during the year. One case of a resident in this district wa8 notified in the parish of Battersea, and as she had only left her home the day previous to the first symptons appearing, I visited her home and made the necessary inquiries, but could not trace the source of infection. The husband was re-vaccinated, and the premises carefully watched for 14 days, but there was no spread of the disease. The official return of the vaccination officer shows that in the year 1893, of the total births in the district, 1,239 were successfully vaccinated, ItiO died unvaccinated, in 11 the vaccination was postponed, 16 were certified insusceptible, 153 had removed, 3 had removed to districts, the vaccinition officer of which had been informed, and only 10 remained on the books as unvaccinated. Scarlet Fever. The notifications of this disease show a marked diminution as compared with 1893, only 133 cases having been notified as against 440. Of these 133, 80 were removed to hospital 106 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. where 2 died, while of the remaining 5'5 treated at home only 1 died. The total case of mortality was therefore only 2'25 per cent. The disease was of a very mild type, and could hardly be said to have been present in epidemic form. The number of notifications in each month is given in Table VII. and this shows that the maximum number was notified in January, and the minimum in June. Diphtheria. 110 cases were notified, with 12 deaths, ''59 cases were removed to Hospital, and of these cases 4 died or 10 2 per cent., while of 71 cases treated at home 8 died or 112 per cent. The total case mortality being 10-9 per cent. The number of deaths at home is 5 below the corrected average. Last year 20 deaths resulted from diphtheria, and this was 7*8 above the corrected decennial average. The following statistics, taken in connection with the monthly notifications'given in Table VII., certainly show that school attendance remains' a factor in the spread of diphtheria. It will be seen from these that the greater number of cases occur between the ages of 5 and 15. and also from Table VII. that the minimum number of notifications occur during holiday season.

This year as last year the larger number of cases occurred in children under school age, as will be seen from the followiug Table Number of Cases of Membranous Croup notified with Number of Deaths.

The case mortality from the two above diseases combined was 17 per cent., which may be considered very low. Enteric Fever. 41 cases were notified with 6 deaths, 12 cases were removed to Hospital where 1 died, while of the 29 treated at home 5 died. This disease shows a fractional increase as compared with 1893, but there were fewer deaths. 10 of the 41 notifications were received in the month of December, at which time it was veryprevalent all over the metropolis. Many of the cases occurred in adults engaged in the City, and in none of their homes could any insanitary conditions be detected. Puerperal Fever, 12 cases were notified with 6 deaths. In every case notified the nurse was duly warned not to attend other cases for 4 weeks, and where possible the clothing worn by the nurse was disinfected by steam. Erysipelas. The number of cases notified was 134 as compared with 194 last year. Experience hi.s uot shown good grounds for the continuance of this among the notifiable diseases. 10 deaths resulted, 3 of these being of infants under 1 year. ^ Cough? 17 deaths were registered as occurring from this, 5'2 below the corrected decennial average. Dian-hoca. 24 deaths occurred from this, 17'9 below the decennial average. The low average temperature of last summer was doubtless the reason why the number of deaths was so much under the decennial average. 19 of the deaths occurred in infants under 1 year. Influenza. This was not so prevalent during 1894. 13 deaths were registered as being due to it, as against 14 in 1893, and 44 in 1892. The deaths from respiratory diseases also show a marked diminution. 108 Mcdical Officers of Health Annual Report.

Notification of Infectious Diseases The total number of cases of infectious diseases notified during the year was 444, as against 868 in 1893, and 588 in 1892. The notifications of small pox were 11, scarlet fever 307, erysipelas 60, diphtheria 41, membranous croup 14 less, while enteric fever was 2, continued fever 1, and puerperal fever 6 more than last year. 3 of the cases of puerperal fever, 4 of scarlet fever and 33 of erysipelas, occurred in the Workhouse; 1 of diphtheria, 1 of enteric fever, and 1 of erysipelas in the Prison; 4 of erysipelas in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 1 of enteric fever in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and 4 of erysipelas in the Patriotic Asylum. The number of deaths was 46 or 10*^6 per cent, of all the cases notified, compared with 8-8 per cent, in 1893 and 9*6 per cent, in 1892. The number of the several diseases, the number of patients sent to hospital, and the number of deaths that occurred in hospital, as well as in the sub-district, are given in the following Table. 109 Parish of Wandsworth. 109 TABLE VI.

From tubercular diseases, which include phthisis pulmonalis, tabes meseuterica, tubercular meningitis, 97 deaths resulted, as compared with 79 last year. This number was, however, 27-7 below the corrected decennial average. Phthisis pulmonalis alone caused 73 deaths, but of these 16 occurred in internal institutions, while Ill Parish of Wandsworth. 18 occurred outside the district among persons belonging to it, making a corrected total of 75. Calculated from this the deathrate per 1,000 from phthisis alone was 1*41 per 1,000. This rate is slightly lower than that of last year, and is '32 per 1,000 lower than the average of England and Wales for the decennium 1881-90. The total tubercular death-rate was 1*88 per 1,000, as compared with 2-43 in England and Wales during the decennium 18S1-90. Of the 75 deaths from phthisis pulmonalis by far the largest number of deaths occurred between the ages of 25 to 45, while from other tubercular diseases the great proportion occurred under 1 year of age. The other diseases grouped under the head of constitutional diseases, viz. gout, rheumatism and cancer, were the cause of 51 deaths, cancer alone being the cause of 32 deaths, 12 males and 20 females. This is 6 more than last year. Diseases of the respiratory organs were the cause of 128 deaths, 56 less than in 1893, and 51 less than the decennial average. 35 of these deaths occurred in infants under 1 year, and 29 from 1 to 5 years. 24 of these occurred in out-lying institutions, while 18 occurred in internal institutions of persons belonging to this district. Diseases of the nervous system caused 111 deaths, 1 more than last year, and 47 below the corrected decennial average. 42 of these deaths occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, and 31 in out-lying institutions. Diseases of the circulatory system caused 52 deaths, 5 less than last year, and 2 "4 below the decennial average. 8 of these occurred in internal institutions, while 22 occurred in external, 17 of these latter taking place in the Union Infirmary. Diseases of the digestive system caused 51 deaths, 11 less than last year but 5*7 above the decennial average; 24 of these deaths occurred in infants under 1 year. 112 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Diseases of the urinary organs caused 24 deaths, 11 of males and 13 of females; this is 4 less than in 1893, and 4*4 less than corrected average. Premature births, low vitality, and congenital defects were the cause of 58 deaths, 14 less than last year, and 7-5 below the corrected decennial average. All these deaths were of children under 1 year. The deaths registered from old age were 38 in number, 15 of males and 23 of females, and were 3 below the corrected average. 28 of these deaths occurred in persons of 75 years and upwards. 12 deaths of persons belonging to the district occurred in the Union Infirmary. From violence, 23 deaths, 18 of males and 5 of females wero registered. This is 3"5 below the decennial average. infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants, under 1 year was 197, 38 less than last year. The per centage of these to the total mortality was 25'6, as compared with 28'6 last year. The infantile death-rate, calculated from the number of registered births, was 121 per 1,000, 25 below last year. This compares favourably with the same rate for the whole of London, which was 143 per 1,000 births, while only 5 districts in London, the constitution of whose population as regards social population is different had a lower infantile mortality. Senile Mortality. The total number of deaths above 70 years of age was, including deaths in external institutions, 97, 32 of males and 65 of females. 113 Parish of Wandsworth.

The decennial average is also given. An increase, as compared with the decennial average, has taken place among the industrial and labouring classes, and this is also observed in the deaths from zymotic diseases. This was to a large extent due to the epidemic of measles, the deaths from which occurred almost exclusively among the industrial and working class. TABLE X. Social Position. Total Deaths.

The epidemic of measles already mentioned, was in this regard the only matter worthy of special note, but as it is not a notifiable disease, no information could be got as to the extent of it. The experience of other places where measles has been included under notifiable diseases, has not been satisfactory. The only remedy which can be applied is the closure of the public elementary schools, but unless this be done within the first few days of the outbreak, little good will result. Agaiu in 115 Parish of Wandsworth. some parts of the district the opportunities for the children playing togethor are such as to make the spread of the disease easy, even supposing the schools were closed. The death-rate of the sub-district, even after all the corrections are applied is a low one, and will compare favourably with other districts. A further correction may be made by working out the factor for age and sex distribution, thus making the death-rate absolutely comparable not only with London itself, but also with other places in England. This factor is as near as possible 1'OoB, and if the recorded death-rate viz., 14'P3 be multiplied by this, a death-rate of 15-94 per 1,090 is got. In 1892, according to the report of the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, the corrected death-rate for the metropolis was 21'6 per 1,000. Sanitation. A summary of the sanitary works is given at page 29. The number of houses and premises inspected during the year was 3,243, as compared with 2,319 in 1893. This increase is due to the fact, that one of the inspectors devotes his whole time to house to house inspection. The diminution in the number of complaints submitted to the local Committee viz., 925 as compared with 1,101, is in my opinion due in some measure to this inspection of certain parts of the district more frequently. That permanent good also results are shown by the fact that the number of preliminary notices served shows a decided diminution. In 1893, with 2,319 houses inspected, 1,000 preliminary notices were served, or a percentage of 43'1; while, in 1894, with 3,243 houses inspected only 857 were served, or a percentage of 26-4. 318 houses and 339 rooms were disinfected after infectious diseases, as compared with 497 and 558 in 1893. 1 set of bedding was burnt, and 137 sets steamed by contractor. This was done with the greatest promptitude, and entirely to my satisfaction. 1 cab, which had conveyed a person suffering from diphtheria, was also disinfected. 116 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. 9 cases of over-crowding were abated, as .against 17 last year. The sanitary inspectors in their house to house inspection frequently discover cases of slight over-crowding, and these are often in houses occupied by the same family. In all these cases last year a little explanation was sufficient to remedy this without the service of any notice. 3 wells were closed after analysis, by order of the Board, but there still remain a number of wells which are used for domestic purposes. The rest of the items refer to the routine work of the sanitary staff, and it is satisfactory to note, that the more serious insanitary conditions as to drains and water supply, show a satisfactory diminution as compared with last year. C°mZ®!tine Although these are not properly under our jurisdiction, yet careful supervision of their sanitary arrangement is a necessity. They are frequently the means of introducing epidemic disease into the locality; there are 12 of these in this sub-district licensed to receive 2;30 lodgers. The drainage of some has been reconstructed during the year. Cow-houses. These, 14 in number, were inspected before the renewal of the licenses In 1 which is not included in the above, as the license was not applied for, the premises were in such an insanitary condition, that I certified them to be an unfit place for keeping cows. The number of cows kept in these 14, viz. 70, diminishes every year, by far the greater amount of milk coming from the country. In 3, no cows at all are kept, but the licenses are kept up. slaughter-houses. There are 9 of these in this district, and I have visited and examined them as usual. The structural condition of the majority of them is not at all satisfactory, although the tenants do all in their power to fulfil the conditions of their license. Tiie only remedy for this state of matters is the establishment of public abbatoirs, which are built with due regard to our modern ideas. Again iu public abbatoirs the meat can all be inspected by au expert lit Parish of Wandsworth. before its removal to the shop and consequent cutting up. There is no doubt that many diseases are caused by eating meat which is, owing to some disease, unfit for food, which disease cannot be detected under the present conditions. Bake-houses. There are 36 of these in the district, and they have all been visited twice in the year. Of these 36,21 are above ground and 15 underground. Of the 21 above ground 15 may be classed as good, and 6 as fair, while of the 15 underground only 2 are good, 8 fair and 5 very fair; this classification is arrived at after taking into consideration the ventilation, lighting, and general sanitary condition. In several, notices were served for limewashing, and in 1 there was an opening from the maiu sewer into the bake-house caused by a defective drain, which was at once remedied. Tho underground bake-houses are in the great majority of cases kept thoroughly clean, but the lighting and ventilation are much inferior as compared with those above ground. I have again to report that the s mitary staff has performed all the duties entrusted to them with tact, and to my entire satisfaction. P. CALDWELL SMITH, M.A., M.D., D.P.H.

This decided improvement is, however, counterbalanced by the fact that while last year the average amount of dilution practised on milk was 10 per cent., it has increased this year to 15. On the other hand, the selling of margarine for butter has decreased from 11 per cent, in 1893, to 2*5 per cent, in 1894, 120 Report—Public Analyst. II.—Groceries. The only articles in this class found to be questionable were two samples of coffee, which proved to contain 60 and 40 per cent, of chicory respectively. No adulterated tea, spices, sugar, or jam have been discovered in the district. III.—Beverages. No samples were submitted under this head during 1894, but although we have usually found such articles to be genuine, I yet do not consider it wise to lose sight of them altogether. IV.—Drugs. The only sample submitted in this department was one of white wax, which was found to contain one half of its weight of paraffin. I would also, in this matter, advise that a few of the more popular drugs commonly used by the multitude should be examined from time to time so as to keep a check on such articles. In conclusion, I have to report that nothing new has occurred either in the shape of novel adulterants or in procedure, except in the case of the sugared milk above referred to, which was subsequently proved to be due to an accident. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN MUTER, ph.d. ; F.k.s.(Edin.); f.i.c., &c., Public Analyst.
