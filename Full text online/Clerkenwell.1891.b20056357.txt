The Vestry of the Parish of St. James and Si. John, Clerkenwell, beg to present the following Report of their proceedings and other matters connected therewith during the year ended on 25th March, 1892. The Parish of Clerkenwell contains 380 acres, about 65 of which are situate in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill. According to the last census (1891) the population was 65,885. The number of Assessments in the Parish is 8431 the rateable value being £366,115. The Parish is divided into five wards, as follows : Ward No. 1 (Pentonville) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies north of a line drawn from the west boundary of the Parish at Battle Bridge, along the centre of Pentonville Road, to the east boundary of the Parish at the top of the City Road, thence up High Street and Liverpool Road to Sermon Lane, thence westward (according to the boundary of the Parish) to Caledonian Road, including Nos. 61 to 77 and 68 to 100 in that road, and 6 to 17, Caledonian Crescent, thence to the western boundary at Battle Bridge, and all that portion of the Parish which is situate at or about Muswell Hill. b 6 This Ward contains 1,721 assessments, of a rateable value of £65,286, and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 2 (St. Philip's) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of King's Cross Road from Baker Street to Battle Bridge, thence up Pentonville Road to the northwest corner of Claremont Square, thence down Amwell Street and Rosoman Street to Exmouth Street, along Exmouth Street and Mount Pleasant to the boundary, thence along the boundary of the Parish to King's Cross Road, bottom of Baker Street, including nearly the whole of the House of Correction site. This Ward contains 1,398 assessments, of a rateable value of £53,482, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's) comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn along Pentonville Road from the northwest corner of Claremont Square to the junction of City Road and Goswell Road, thence down Goswell Road to the corner of Spencer Street, (including Nos. 290 to 320 on the northeast side of Goswell Road, and Nos. 1 and 30 in Sidney Street,) thence along Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Rosoman Street, and Amwell Street, to the northwest corner of Claremont Square. This Ward contains 1,184 assessments, of a rateable value of £58,377, and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 4 (St. James') comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn from Goswell Road along the centre of Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Exmouth Street, and Mount 7 Pleasant, to the boundary of the Parish, thence along the line of the Old Fleet Ditch to the new street opposite Clerkenwell Green, and thence along Clerkenwell Green (north side of Sessions House) and Aylesbury Street to St. John Street, thence up the centre of St. John Street to Percival Street, along the centre of Percival Street, and up Goswell Road to Spencer Street. This Ward contains 2,521 assessments, of a rateable value of £102,214, and returns eighteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 5 (St. John's), comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies south of the southern boundary of Ward 4, bounded on the east by a line drawn along the centre of Goswell Road from Percival Street to Clerkenwell Road, on the west by the Old Fleet Ditch, and on the south by a line drawn from Goswell Road down Clerkenwell Road, thence irregularly, according to the boundary to the Parish, to the Old Fleet Ditch. This Ward contains 1,607 assessments, of a rateable value of £85,766, and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Muswell Hill.—With regard to this outlying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of ClerkenwTell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about live miles and a half from London, and on the northwestern confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a ' great cure performed upon a King of Scot, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell,' a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell. Here was placed an image of 8 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows, at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River. "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initials affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 67 separate assessments. Rates.—During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the halfyear to Michaelmas, 1891. A Poor Rate of 1s. 6d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £25,560 A Lighting Rate 1d. „ „ „ 1,420 A General Rate 1s. 1d. „ „ „ 18,460 2s. 8d. £45,440 9 For the halfyear to Ladyday, 1892. A Poor Rate of 1s. 7d. including a Library Rate of 1d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £26,980 A Lighting Rate 1d. „ „ „ 1,420 A General Rate 1s. 1d. „ „ „ 18,460 2s. 9d. £46,860 The rates made in April, for the halfyear to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £361,910, and those made in October, for the half year to Ladyday, upon a rateable value of £362/271. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £27,673 in the first, and £24,724 in the second halfyear, total £52,397. The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £5,061 15s. 7d. and £3,564 5s. 0d. in the first and second halfyears respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union, include the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor Rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £17,718 10s. 0d., divided into moieties of £8,859 5s. 0d. in the first, and £8,859 5s. 0d. in the second halfyear. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, they receive from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with twofifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants previously paid from 10 the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payments of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the latter amount for the year ending Ladyday, 1892 is £7,886, the amount being based for the first five local financial years on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The precepts of the School Board for the year 1891 amounted to the sum of £16,589 15s. 11d. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,539 15s. 10d. It will thus be seen that of the £92,238 raised during the year, the sum of £67,900 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 5s. 5d. in the pound for the year. 4s. was for other bodies, and 1s. 5d. for the local administration, paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1,349 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned, are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. 11 That this is so is patent from the fact that only five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 27 Committal Warrants per quarter were granted in respect of nonpayment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied, and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 12 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Valuation Lists.—One Supplemental and four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year, dealing with 441 Assessments and raising the rateable value by £6,993. School Board Precepts.—The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870 :— £ s. d. £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1882 8,067 10 5 1872 943 11 2 1883 9,397 16 2 1873 780 0 2 1884 11,054 2 2 1874 1,869 9 3 1885 11,999 1 10 1875 3,267 12 11 1886 12,890 9 0 1876 4,897 4 9 1887 12,210 12 5 1877 6,046 10 1 1888 11,717 15 1 1878 6,013 14 10 1889 13,252 6 0 1879 6,371 7,436 8 9 11 1890 16,052 19 4 1880 8 1891 16.589 15 11 1881 7,900 4 4 12 Metropolitan Board Precepts,—The follow ing is a list of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to the coming into force of the Local Government Act, 1888, in March, 1889.

Do. 81st March, 1891 (13.25) £19,900 2s. 3d. Do. 31st March, 1892 (11.75) £17,718 10s. 0d. Some further particulars as to these Precepts will be found on page 9. Proposed Amendment of Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869.—In July, 1891, the Vestry received from the County Council a copy of a Report of their County Rate Committee, on the desirability of amending the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, by giving greatly extended powers to the Council, in the direction of controlling and revising the proceedings of the local rating authorities. After a very full consideration of the proposals, the Vestry, in common with many other rating authorities, expressed itself strongly against them. Decease of H.R.H. The Duke of Clarence and Avondale.—At the Meeting of the Vestry on the 14th January, 1892, the Vestry heard with deep regret of the decease that morning of H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, and unanimously passed resolutions of sympathy with Her Majesty the Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, whose wedding with the deceased Duke was to have been celebrated on the 27th of the next month. Engrossments of the resolutions were duly forwarded to the Queen, and the other members of the Royal Family referred to, and acknowledgments were received and entered on the Vestry's Minutes. 14 Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1891. —The Vestry have proceeded to put in force the provisions of this Act during the year in the case of the following premises:— 1, 2, 3, Clement's Court. Victoria Cottages. 6, Suffolk Street. Caroline Place. Kemp Place. Union Court. Mount Zion. Wood's Yard, Sermon Lane. 2, Lloyd's Row. 26, Winchester Street. 9 and 11, Southampton Street. 8½, William Street. Bolton Court.—The last Annual Report recorded that a motion had been submitted to the Vestry to demolish Bolton Court, in consequence of its obstruction of light, air, and ventilation to Margaret Court adjoining, but that the Vestry were awaiting legal advice on their position in the matter, having regard to the passing of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The Solicitors advising that no further proceedings could be taken under the Acts under which the proceedings were commenced, they were instructed to take such steps as might be necessary to procure the demolition of the premises. Section 38 of the new Act provides for the demolition of "obstructive buildings," and the Medical Officer of Health therefore gave a certificate under this section. The certificate was referred to the Surveyor, who reported that he estimated the cost of pulling down the houses and clearing the ground at £50, but that he had no means of estimating the value of the interests of 15 Mr. Tammadge's Executors and Mr. Lewis Thomas. It will be remembered that when a proposal to demolish these houses was before the Vestry in 1888, it appeared that there were still four interests in the property, viz., those of Tammadge's executors, Mr. Wenkheim, Mr. Lewis Thomas, and the Marquis Northampton, and that letters were received from Mr. Boodle and Mr. Wenkheim, offering to render all assistance in their power; but that Tammadge's executors set up a considerable claim, which was considered excessive, and Mr. Lewis Thomas, thought he was not prepared then to offer objection, did not waive his claim to compensation. The Vestry therefore, before proceeding further in the matter, directed the Solicitors to put themselves in communication with Messrs. Bolton & Mote, the solicitors to the executors of Mr. Tammadge, as to whether they proposed to again submit their claim in the event of the Vestry proceeding in the matter. The solicitors forwarded the reply they received, by which it appeared that the claim was to be pressed, and Messrs. Bolton & Mote suggested that the Vestry should acquire their client's interest in the Foresters' Arms Beerhouse. The A Vestry decided to continue the proceedings, and copies of the reports of the Medical Officer and Surveyor were accordingly furnished to the parties concerned. Some delay took place in the matter, by reason of a notice served upon Mr. Daiton by the solicitor of the Marquis Northampton, to put the premises in repair or pay damages. The notices reached the Vestry who, in taking over Bolton Court, had indemnified Mr. Dalton, and the ensuing correspondence took some time. The matter had reached this stage at the date to which this report extends. Bishop's Court.—The Vestry in July, 1891, received a representation from the Medical Officer 16 of Health, under sec. 38 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, certifying that the house, 6½, Bishop's Court, by reason of its proximity to the other houses in the Court stops ventilation, and otherwise conduces to make the other houses in Bishop's Court unfit for human habitation. The proceedings provided by the Act ensued, the Surveyor's estimate of the cost of acquiring and pulling down the property being £125. The owners were invited to attend the Vestry on the 7th January, but the only person who attended represented a Building Society, which was mortgagee of the interest of Mr. B. Smith, who had less than twentyone years' lease, and was therefore not an owner within the meaning of the Act. The solicitor to the freeholder wrote that the property was in Chancery, and the trustees could not give any consents or take any course without obtaining the approval of the Court, and would not therefore attend, but they would however be glad to sell the property, but he added that the Surveyor's estimate was wholly inadequate. After considering the matter, the Vestry adjourned the further consideration until after Bolton Court has been dealt with, under the same section of the Act. Notification of Infectious Disease.—The Vestry have been vigilant in insisting upon the provision of the law being complied with, with reference to the prompt notification to them as the sanitary authority of cases of those diseases which are a source of danger to the community, as defined by the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, and subsequently by the Public Health (London) Act, and have felt it to be their duty to institute proceedings in some cases for a breach of the law. The Vestry have had before them a letter from the Vestry of Chelsea, suggesting that Erysipelas 17 should be expunged from the Infectious Diseases Notification Act. The Vestry, however, have followed the advice of their Medical Officer, who stated that he disagreed with the views of the Vestry of Chelsea in this matter, and thought it important to the health of the Parish that Erysipelas should be notified, and they therefore passed a resolution disagreeing with the suggestion of the Chelsea Vestry. The Vestry have also had before them a communication from the Vestry of St. Margaret, Westminster, suggesting the desirability of taking steps to obtain the classification of measles as a disease to be notified. The Medical Officer of Health having expressed the opinion that the mere notification of cases of measles would be of no practical benefit to the public generally, the Vestry decided that no action be taken thereon. In February, 1892, the Vestry had before them a communication from the Local Government Board, forwarding copy Memorandum issued by them with reference to the then prevailing epidemic of Influenza, and recommending isolation and disinfection in certain cases. The Medical Officer of Health stated that there was at present a great difference of opinion as to influenza being a contagious or infectious disease, and it was not included under the diseases mentioned among those to be notified in section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, and the Vestry therefore took no action thereon. Among the details of the sanitary administration of the Parish may be mentioned a request, with which the Vestry complied, by Mrs. Hawthorn, Hon. Superintendent of the Clerkenwell Branch of 18 the Bible Women and Nurses' Mission, who wrote as follows :— "Visiting in Clerkenwell, as Superintendent of a District Nurse, I find our work much hampered by the dirty condition of our patient's bedding. Two-thirds of our nurse's cases are lying-in women, and their feather or flock beds are in a state of tilth which can scarcely be imagined, except by a doctor or nurse accustomed to work among the very poor. "Needless to say the risk of blood-poisoning and other mischief is very great, and we have lost one woman from blood-poisoning, caused chiefly by the insanitary condition of her bedding. We propose lending a palliasse to these women, on condition that before their confinement they should wash the ticking of their own bed; but the difficulty will be in getting the feathers, or wool, purified, and we shall be very grateful if you will help us in this matter by allowing them to be baked in the oven used by your Sanitary Officer for disinfecting purposes." International Congress of Hygiene and Demography.—In May, 1891, the Vestry received an invitation to appoint delegates to attend this Congress in the following August. The subjects for discussion being all more or less intimately connected with the work carried on by Vestries and other local authorities, and it being intended that the results of the Congress would be made available to all by the printing of the full transactions, and (if funds are available) the statistical and other information gathered from Municipal and Sanitary Authorities throughout the Kingdom, the Vestry appointed Mr. Putterill and Mr. Dixie, the Chairman and ViceChairman, and Mr. Evan Jones, a member of the Sanitary Committee, as their delegates, and subscribed a moderate sum to the funds. The delegates presented the following report:— Your Committee beg to submit to you a short report of the work on which they have been engaged as Delegates from the Vestry to the abovementioned Congress. Your Committee attended the opening: meeting at St. James's Hall ; the attendance at which was sufficient to show that this most 19 necessary branch of Medical Science has at last commanded widespread sympathy, which it so well deserves, at the hands of the public at large, as well as those specially interested in the advance of Sanitary and Medical Science. The work of the Congress was arranged in ten sections, which carried on their discussions simultaneously: it was, therefore, impossible for your Committee to attend all the meetings, so they separated and endeavoured to attend those sections which most directly concerned their work as members of your Sanitary Committee; amongst the sections which they attended being those on Preventive Medicine; Bacteriology; The Relation of Diseases of Animals to those of Men; Infancy, Childhood, and School Life; Architecture in Relation to Hygiene; State Hygiene. And they heard papers read and discussed on the following subjects, namely:— Mode of Preventing the Spread of Epidemic Disease. Action of Disinfectants on Bacteria. Danger of consuming meat of Tuberculous Animals. Infectious Diseases of the Udder of the Cow in relation to Epidemic Diseases in Man. Education of Children, Hygiene of Schools, Effects of Posture, &c., Physical, Manual, and Technical Instruction, &c. Education of the Blind and Deaf Mutes. Diagnosis of each class in reference to Mental Capacity. Protection of Infant Life, Infantile Insurance, &c. Common Lodging Houses, Block Dwellings, Housing of the Working Classes, &c. Notification of Infectious Diseases. Sale of Poisons, &c. Sanitary Registration of Houses. Education, Position, and Duties of Medical Officers of Health, Sanitary Inspectors, Plumbers, and Midwives. It is evident that your Committee could but listen and learn at these discussions, as so many gentlemen learned in the Science were present from all parts of the globe taking part in them. Every Member of the Congress will shortly receive a copy of all its transactions, which will contain a great deal of valuable information on Sanitary matters, and your Committee will be pleased to lay it on the table or to lend it to anyone wishing to see it. Your Committee also attended and visited the Works of the Refuse Disposal Company at Chelsea, and beg to recommend that these works should be visited by a small joint Committee of the Works and Sanitary Committees, with a view of considering whether some of the methods there employed may not be adopted at the Vestry's Wharf. 20 Tour Committee also visited the Sewage Outfall Works at Barking Creek, and the Beckton Gas Works of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and have made arrangements for a similar Committee to visit each of these places should that be the pleasure of the Vestry. Your Committee beg to state that what they heard at the Meetings of the Congress and the valuable information they gathered from visits to the above places will, undoubtedly, be very useful to them in fulfilling their duties as Members of the Board. In conclusion, your Committee beg to express their best thanks to the Board for the confidence reposed in them by appointing them as Delegates to the Congress, and also to the Organizing and Reception Committees of the Congress for the cordial greeting and hospitable reception accorded to them at every meeting they had the honour and pleasure to attend. {Signed) W. R. PUTTERILL. ALFRED J. DIXIE. EVAN JONES. Public Health (London) Act, 1891.—This most important Act of Parliament consolidates the various sanitary and other Acts dealing with the public health of the Metropolis, in addition to making many new provisions. It is a Government measure introduced by the President of the Local Government Board, and received great attention from the local authorities during its passage through Parliament, this Vestry among many others presenting a petition for amendments. Among the important alterations made in the law by this measure may be enumerated the following:— The transfer of the duty of cleansing footways from the occupiers or owners of the houses abutting thereon to the Sanitary Authorities. [In view of the almost impracticable character of this clause in times of snow, great efforts were made to eliminate this provision from the Bill (which did not contain it when it was introduced, the clause being added by the Grand Committee) but notwithstanding the opposition of Mr. Ritchie himself, who had charge of the measure, it was retained, and now forms part of the Act.] The liability to a fine of any employe of a Vestry who demands a fee for the removal of house refuse. The liability of the sanitary authority to a fine for non removal of dust within a specified time. 21 The power and duty of the sanitary authority to make byelaws for the prevention of nuisances arising from various causes. The power of the sanitary authority to enter any premises to inspect same for the purpose of ascertaining whether any insanitary conditions exist. The Act came into force on the 1st January, 1892, and the Vestry gave special attention to its provisions, especially with regard to the removal of house refuse, trade refuse, manure, &c., and as a result issued the following notice to every householder in the Parish.:— REMOVAL OF REFUSE. The Vestry of the Parish of Clerkenwell, in consequence of the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which comes into force on the 1st January, 1892, have been compelled to revise the conditions under which the removal of domestic and trade refuse is carried on, and they hereby give notice to the inhabitants of the result of such revision. House Refuse. Arrangements have been made by which the dustmen will pass down every street in the parish twice during each week on the days notified on the accompanying card, and they have instructions to call at everv house in which the card is exhibited. Householders are, therefore, requested to display the card in some conspicuous part of their premises when they wish the dust or refuse removed, as it will not be practicable for the dustmen to call on other than the appointed days. The Vestry desire to call the attention of householders to the pecuniary and sanitary benefits which would result if such refuse as potato peelings, cabbage leaves, and the like were burnt instead of being thrown in the dustbin. A large proportion of the contents of dustbins consists of this kind of refuse, which rapidly becomes very offensive to the householders and at the same time costs a largo sum to the Vestry, and consequently to the ratepayers, to get rid of. The Vestry, therefore, hope that the inhabitants will in their own interest cooperate in reducing this class of refuse to the smallest possible dimensions. The dustmen are bound without fee or reward to remove house refuse. The Vestry desire also to call attention to the alteration in the law with regard to gratuities to dustmen: Any person in the Vestry's employ who demands any fee or gratuity for removing house refuse is liable to a fine not exceeding 20s. C 22 Trade Refuse. The Vestry are not required to remove trade refuse (which is defined by the Act to mean the refuse of any trade, manufacture, or business, or any building materials) except upon payment of a reasonable sum for such removal. They, therefore, beg to give notice that they are prepared to undertake such removal at a charge of 3s. 6d. per load, 1s. 9d. per half load, and 1s. per quarter load, forty bushels being considered one load, and no smaller charge than 1s. being made. The Vestry, however, reserve the right to vary this charge in exceptional cases. Manure. The Vestry for the future decline to remove Cow dung. They are prepared to remove Stable Manure from stables of not more than two horses, provided the occupiers signify their consent in writing, which consent shall not be withdrawn or revoked without one month's previous notice to the Vestry. Any communication or complaint on any of the above matters should be addressed to the undersigned. By Order, Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, Robert Paget, Vestry Clerk. December, 1891. The Act, as before stated, provides that any employe demanding a fee for removing dust shall be liable to a fine. Receiving a fee is not prohibited, but the Vestry felt that, to put an effectual stop to the system which probably pressed heavily on the poorer inhabitants and resulted in those who gave the largest gratuity being best attended to, it was necessary to take further steps. They therefore increased the dustmen's wages by 5s. per week, and prohibited them, under pain of dismissal, from receiving any gratuity. Building Acts Consolidation Bill.—In August, 1891, the Vestry received from the Local Government Board a draft of a Bill which had been prepared for the purpose of consolidating the enactments relating to the construction and use of buildings in London, the Board asking for any observations or 23 suggestions which the Vestry might desire to offer, and stating that the President was especially desirous of having his attention drawn to any provisions in the Bill which it might be considered did not accurately reproduce the present law. The Vestry, however, deemed it inexpedient to take any action in the matter. Subsequently a Conference was invited by the Vestry of Kensington, but the Vestry adhered to its resolution and took no part in such Conference. Coal Dues.—At the close of the last parochial year the Vestry had appointed delegates to a Conference at the Kensington Town Hall, to consider the desirability of endeavouring to obtain a reimposition of the Coal Dues. A letter was subsequently received from the Corporation of the City of London enclosing report of the Coal, Corn, and Finance Committee, from which it appeared that they were waiting a more decisive expression of opinion from the Yestries and District Boards before taking further steps for such reimposition. The Kensington Conference of Delegates from the Yestries and District Boards passed the following resolutions:— (a) That this Conference of Delegates expressing the views of 19 Parishes and Districts of the Metropolis, having a population of over 1,564,431, and a rateable value of £11,841,332, is of opinion that the abolition of the Coal Dues has totally failed to afford the relief predicted at the time that they were abolished, experience having clearly proved that not only has no gain come to the coal consumers of London, but that an appreciable increase has been caused by their abolition in the direct local taxation of the Metropolis, and a serious obstacle raised to the carrying out of important Metropolitan improvements. (i) That this Conference, being fully convinced that the re imposition of the Dues would not be prejudicial to the coal consumers at large, but would afford a welcome relief to the heavily burthened ratepayers of the Metropolis, is of opinion that it is highly 24 desirable that steps should be taken with the object of restoring to the inhabitants of the Metropolis the benefits so long derived from the said Dues, and that the London County Council and CityCorporation be asked to co-operate in the movement. (c) That a copy of the Resolutions adopted by the Conference be forwarded to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as the representative of Her Majesty's Government, the London County Council, the Corporation of the City of London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. No further action has yet teen taken in the matter. Rosebery Avenue.—On the 16th December, 1891, the Improvements Committee of the London Comity Council, headed by Mr. H. Clarke, their Chairman, formally opened that portion of the new thoroughfare lying between St. John Street Road and Garnault Place. The Vestry's Works Committee, in pursuance of a resolution of the Vestry, met the Improvements Committee, and Mr. F. A. Ford introduced Mr. Churchwarden Robson as the acting Chairman of the Vestry, and Mr. Walton as Chairman of the Works Committee. The usual letter, handing over the thoroughfare, was handed to Mr. Robson. The original scheme of the Council left Spa Green extending southwards in an unbroken line from Lloyd's Row to the southern point of the present paved triangular piece of ground, but the Vestry urged that a great convenience to the traffic would be provided if the roadway of Gloucester Street were continued through the Green to Rosebery Avenue. The Council at first declined to comply with the request, but afterwards acceded thereto, and formed the roadway. Another improvement in the new street is also due to the initiation of the Vestry. The brick wall enclosing the New River Company's reservoir between Arlington Street and the Company's office 25 was to be pulled down, and a new wall erected by the County Council in a line with the wall to the south of the office, the Company enclosing the land in exchange for land given up in Spa Green. The Vestry represented to the Company that a great improvement would be effected if an open railing were substituted for the brick wall to open up to the public view the large space of the New River grounds. After some hesitation the Company acceded to the Vestry's suggestion, subject to the Council consenting to erect such a dwarf wall and railing as the Company could approve. The Council were then communicated with and agreed to the proposal, and the Vestry expressed their thanks to the Council and the Company for their compliance with the suggestion. Coldbath Fields Prison Site.—Resuming the record of the proceedings which have been taken by the Vestry with reference to the interest of the Parish in the Coldbath Fields Prison site at the point where it was left last year, the Vestry have to state that at their meeting on the 9th April, 1891, the Clerk stated that it had come to his knowledge that the Postmaster-General was, in respect to the Oldham Gardens site, about to hand over to the County Council the sum of £10,000, and that it was understood he wanted to make it a condition that the money should be spent in providing an open space for Clerkenwell, but the Council would not accept the condition, and the money was to be handed over unconditionally. The Vestry thereupon decided to petition the London County Council, asking that the £10,000 might be spent in providing open spaces for Clerkenwell, and appointed a Deputation to support such Petition. On the l6th April a letter was read from Mr. F. A. Ford, L.C.C., stating that the Vestry had been 26 misinformed upon the matter, and that there was no danger of the £10,000 being applied to any other constituency, and that he had seen the Chairman of the Council, Sir John Lubbock, and Mr. Haggis, the Deputy Chairman, who both laughed to scorn any suggestion that the amount should be applied to another constituency. A deputation of the Vestry attended the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the Council on the 29th May, and urged that the amount should be expended in Clerkenwell, and the view put forward appeared to meet with a favourable reception. On the 2nd August the following question and answer in the House of Commons appeared in The Times:— "Captain Penton urged the Postmaster General to give effect to the recommendation of the Select Committee which required him, in the event of the Coldbath Fields Prison Site being used exclusively for Post Office purposes, to band over to the County Council the sum of £10,000, wherewith they might in the same locality purchase land for an open space. The Treasury, he was informed, were quite willing to hand over the money, and he hoped the right hon. gentlemen would consent and not drive such a hard bargain with the County Council as to compel them to make an offer of a site which was unsuitable as an open space. Mr. Raikes said that reference had been made to the land connected with Coldbath Fields Prison. He was sorry that any ground for complaint had arisen, but he could not find it in his heart to take £10,000 and present it to any district in London." The matter being brought to the notice of the Vestry, they directed the Clerk to write to the London County Council and the Secretary of the Post Office, asking for an explanation as to the position of the matter. The Clerk of the Council replied that the Committee of the Council, which had charge of the matter, was still in correspondence with the Post Office on the subject, and was not in a position to 27 say more, and that the difficulty which the Council bad had was somewhat increased by a communication made to the late Postmaster-General* by Captain Penton, M.P., apparently at the Vestry's instance, in which Captain Penton pressed Mr. Raikes to pay the Council the sum of £10,000 rather than sell a portion of the site. At the Vestry Meeting on the 10th December, the following letter was received:— General Post Office, London, Sir, December 3rd, 1891. With reference to the communications which passed in 1889-90 with reference to the proposed widening of Farringdon Road along the eastern side of the site of the disused prison at Coldbath Fields now occupied by this department—a matter which has been allowed to stand over pending a settlement of the question whether a portion of the site was to be sold to the Council for an open space or to be retained for Post Office purposes—I am directed to inform you that it having now been settled that the department is to keep the land, the Postmaster-General would be prepared to remove the old prison wall and to substitute iron railings, from the corner of Calthorpe Street to Oldham Gardens, setting them back so as to increase the width of the street uniformly to 60 feet on the following conditions:— As this will involve giving up to the public about 440 square yards of land, worth at least £1,000, the Postmaster General, before giving directions in the matter, will be glad to learn that the Parish Authorities will undertake to reset the paving and remake the road. Also, inasmuch as the iron railings will be continued along the Calthorpe Street frontage, I am to suggest that under these circumstances, the public urinal on the pavement, which will be just under the windows of the new Post Office buildings, should be removed at least to the centre of the street. On hearing that the Vestry accept these conditions instructions will be given for the removal of the wall. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant Robert Paget, Fsq., Vestry Clerk. G. W. SMYTH. The Vestry accepted the offer of the PostmasterGeneral, and, at the same time, directed that a further communication be addressed to the County *Mr. Raikes had died in the meantime. 28 Council, urging the claim of the Parish of Clerkenwell to the sum of £10,000 received by the Council from the Post Office, as provided by the Post Office Sites Act. The Council replied on the 5th January that the whole subject was under their consideration. The matter was at this stage at the close of the period to which this report relates. St. James' Churchyard, Opening of.—The formal opening of St. James' Churchyard was performed by Lady Lubbock, on Wednesday evening, the 1st July, at 6.30 p.m. Sir John Lubbock, M.P., Chairman of the London County Council, Captain Penton, M.P., Earl Compton, and Mr. F. A. Ford, and several members of the Public Gardens Association were present upon the occasion. Land in Smith Street.—The Marquess of Northampton, through his agent Mr. Boodle, proposed that he should pave two pieces of ground on the west side of Smith Street, on the understanding that the Vestry would cleanse and light them, and allow them to be used for recreation, &c., and as an approach to the adjoining property, but it was not proposed to dedicate the pieces of land to the public, but to preserve them as the private property of the Marquess, subject to the agreement with the Vestry. Mr. Boodle further intimated that hereafter, when re-building of the neighbourhood takes place, some re-arrangement will probably have to be made, and there will, no doubt, be wider spaces provided. The agreement was duly entered into, and the pieces of ground were formally thrown open on the 17th August, 1891. 29 Municipal Band.—In July, 1891, the Vestry received a letter from the Vestry of Hammersmith, protesting against the proposal of the London County Council to expend the sum of £3,200 from the rates in providing a municipal band of musicians for playing in the public parks and recreation grounds of the metropolis, and inviting the Vestry to take similar action. Between the date of the resolution of the Hammersmith Vestry and its consideration by the Vestry, the Council decided to subsidise the bands already playing to the extent of £1,500, and the Vestry passed a resolution approving of such expenditure, and thanking the Council for its action. Hoardings.—The Vestry having found difficulty in dealing with cases where licenses have been taken out for hoardings on the public way, which have been used for advertising purposes, and no steps have been apparently taken for erecting buildings upon the enclosed ground, they have directed their Surveyor not to give permission to place any hoarding on the public footway until the plans for the proposed building have been submitted to him, and satisfactory evidence given that the work will be immediately commenced and proceeded with; and that returns be made to the Vestry from time to time by the Surveyor of any hoarding or hoardings which have been licensed or in existence for more than three months, with the names and addresses of the licensees, and where the hoarding or hoardings is or are situate, and that such returns be made and laid before the Vestry at the next meeting after the expiration of the three months. Kiosk, Clerkenwell Green.—In July, 1891, the Vestry received a communication from the 30 Solicitors of the International Hygienic Society, asking whether they were disposed to purchase the Kiosk on Clerkenwell Green, as the society was winding up its business. The subsequent negotiations resulted in the Vestry purchasing the structure for £50. A urinal had for many years previously existed on the spot, and as the kiosk contained also lavatory and water closet accommodation, the Vestry deemed it more expedient to purchase it than to compel its removal. It is satisfactory to know that the extra accommodation involves no cost to the rates, as the small payment made for its use pays for the services of the attendant. District Councils.—This long talked of alteration in the municipal government of the Metropolis has apparently made no progress since the Vestry's last report. No Bill has been introduced into Parliament with the object of creating District Councils, and the only way in which the matter has been brought under the consideration of the Vestry has been by the receipt of schemes for the constitution of such Councils suggested by the Vestries of St. James, Westminster, and Islington. The Vestry received from the Strand District Board of Works copy petition they had presented to the Local Government Board on the subject of the degrees of indebtedness of the various District Boards and Vestries of the Metropolis, praying that in any Bill which may be brought into Parliament altering the existing areas, due and adequate provision may be made so that all loans outstanding at the time of the passing of the Act may remain hereafter charged upon the same local areas now liable therefor; and asking the Vestry to take similar action. The matter was one in which the Parish of Clerkenwell had a deep interest as its debt on loans is one of the smallest in the Metropolis, and tho Vestry endorsed the views of the Strand 31 District Board, and communicated with the Local Government Board accordingly. Election of County Councillors.—The triennial Election of the London County Council was held on the 5th March, 1892. Earl Compton, M.P. and Mr. F. A. Ford, who were elected in 1889, both retired, and, after a poll, the Hon. Ashley G. Ponsonby and Mr. E. Bowen Rowlands were elected, the numbers being as follows:— Hon. A. G. Ponsonby 1902 Mr. E. Bowen-Rowlands 1902 Mr. H. E. Davis 1265 ,, J. E. Bourne 1139 School Board Election.—In November, 1891, the triennial election of the School Board for London took place. The members elected for Finsbury, of which Clerkenwell is a constituent part, were:— Mr. Clough 14,660 ,, Smith 11,931 ,, Stockall 10,690 Miss Eve 10,642 Mr. Sharp 10,590 ,, Bourke 9,080 The unsuccessful candidates were:— Mr. Forder 8,943 Rev. J. H. Bose 6,846 Mr. Back 5,233 ,, Cook 4,227 ,, Stonelake 1,329 Mr. Ponder 633 ,, Pimlett 285 „ Chapman 275 ,, Baker 147 ,, Bishop 146 It is worthy of note that, notwithstanding the effect of the cumulative vote, by which it is possible by organisation to concentrate a large number of votes on one candidate, and so to provide for the representation of minorities, the successful candidates were supported by the majority of the voters as well as of the votes. Notwithstanding the complaints made by so many of the ratepayers of the rapid growth of the School Board Rate, only 16,094 Finsbury electors out of a total of 86,820 voted, or 18.5 per cent. Prior to the Election, a communication was received from the Vestry of St. James', Westminster, forwarding a report of their Finance 32 Committee on the subject of the great increase of expenditure of the School Board, which was duly considered by the Finance Committee, who drew the special attention of the Vestry to the following paragraphs in the report:— That, as compared with the year 1889, the charge on the rates has increased 36.88 per cent., while the number of children educated has only increased 4.12 per cent. That for the year ended Lady-day, 1889, the charge on the Rates for School Maintenance alone was £1 17s. 4d. per child (the cost of the two previous years being £1 17s. 1d.), but the cost for the current year is estimated at £2 9s. 2d. That for the year ended the 25th March, 1889, the Inspectors, Instructors, and School Correspondents cost £16,198, but for the current year their cost is estimated at £24,783. That the office expenses have increased from £22,967 to £35,970 in the same period. That under both these heads the cost has increased by more than 50 per cent,, although the number of scholars in average attendance by no more than has increased 4.12 per cent. The Vestry passed the following resolutions thereon:— That one course the Vestry can take is to call the attention of the ratepayers to the great increase in the expenditure, with the view to their attention being given thereto at the forthcoming election: and that this Vestry is of opinion that the increased expenditure on education presses too heavily upon the ratepayers of the Metropolis, and that the incidence of the School Board Rate ought co be altered. 33 That the Vestry also consider it desirable to reaffirm their resolution in favour of the Electoral Areas of the School Board being assimilated to the Electoral Areas for Parliamentary and County Council purposes, as tending to promote greater interest in the elections, and a more thorough touch between the members and their constituents. On the invitation of the St. Pancras Yestry the Yestry appointed delegates to a Conference on the 27th January, on the subject of an alteration of the Electoral Areas. The Conference passed resolutions in favour of the Parliamentary Divisions being the electoral divisions of the School Board, of the abolition of the cumulative vote, and of vacancies on the School Board being filled up by the ratepayers instead of by members of the School Board, and also asked the Education Department to receive a deputation on the subject; but Sir W. Hart Dyke replied that, having regard to the improbability of any legislation in connection with the matter being proceeded with in the forthcoming session, and to the time that must elapse before another School Board Election takes place, he did not think any useful purpose would be served by receiving a deputation at that moment. Proposed Purchase of Tramways by the London County Council.—The County Council on the 19th March, 1891, approved the principle of the purchase of a portion of the system of the London Streets Tramways Company, which would in the year 1891 come within the operation of sec. 43 of the Company's Act, 1870, which empowers the Council within six months after the expiration of twenty-one years from the passing of the Act to purchase the undertaking upon terms of paying the then value, exclusive of any allowance for past or 34 future profits. Shortly afterwards the Vestry received a communication from the Wandsworth District Board of Works strongly disapproving of the proposed purchase or of the purchase or construction of any other tramways by the Council. The Vestry considered the subject, but adjourned it without expressing an opinion. They subsequently received further communications from other local authorities disapproving of the action of the Council. The Council held two statutory meetings with the object of giving formal notice to the Company, but the resolutions were invalid because there was not a sufficient number of councillors present and voting, but at a third meeting on 27th October the necessary resolution was carried, and the notice was duly served. Lighting Staircases of Artizans' Dwellings. —Action taken by the Yestry in this matter was referred to in the last report; but, as little effect appeared to be produced, the Vestry in September, 1891, referred the matter to the Works Committee. The Committee spent four nights in visiting the various blocks of dwellings in the Parish, and reported as follows:— The Committee are most strongly of opinion, after a careful examination of the premises, that all the dwellings in which the lights are turned off at eleven o'clock are dangerous, both by reason of the liability to accident and by reason of the hiding-places they afford to wrong-doers; and they recommend—That the several owners be so informed, and that the Vestry urge upon them to follow the example of those who have granted this concession to their tenants. They also recommend—that the attention of the County Council be called to the matter, with the view to power being obtained by legislation to to compel the proper lighting of the staircases and corridors. These recommendations were adopted by the Vestry, and in December the Vestry received a letter from the Council stating that they had referred the matter to the Parliamentary Committee, 35 acting in concert with the Housing Committee, to procure, if possible, the insertion of a clause in a public general Bill in the next session of Parliament, providing for the proper lighting of common staircases and passages in blocks of artizans' dwellings. Clerkenwell Road.—The question of the jurisdiction over that part of Clerkenwell Road between Goswell Road and St. John Street has engaged the attention of the Vestry during the past year. When the road was constructed some fourteen years ago it does not appear that that portion which was in the parish of the Charterhouse was handed over to that parish for future maintenance, it being apparently overlooked by the Metropolitan Board of Works that the south side of the road was formed in that parish, the consequence being that the road had been cared for by the Vestry of Clerkenwell entirely. On the other hand, the Clerkenwell Vestry had received the whole of the compensation paid by the North Metropolitan Tramways Company for the paving and the whole of the rates on the tramways laid down. It has therefore been agreed between the authorities of the Charterhouse and Clerkenwell, that an application be made to the County Council to make an order placing the road entirely under the jurisdiction of Clerkenwell; and the application has been made accordingly. Metropolitan Improvements and Rating of Ground Values.—A letter was received in December from the Vestry of Plumstead stating that, whilst regretting the necessity for the delay of any necessary improvements in the Metropolis, they consider that the action of the London County Council, in desiring that a portion of the 36 cost of such improvements should fall upon the owners who materially benefit thereby, is to be commended, the principle being a fair and just one, and requesting the Government to initiate legislation upon this subject, with a view of relieving the over-burdened taxpayers of the Metropolis, the occupiers having at present to pay more than their fair share of the costs of improvements, the owners, who benefit the most, escaping their fair share. The Vestry passed a resolution agreeing with the principle contained in such letter. Subsequently letters were received from the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, and the St. Olave's District Board of Works, forwarding resolutions that in their opinion the ground rent ought to be taxed as well as the building rent, and that the revenue derived from this source should be devoted to the relief of local rates. The Vestry have referred the subject to the Assessment Committee for consideration, but they had not reported thereon within the period embraced by this report. Election of Guardians.—The Vestry have considered a communication from the Vestry of St. Luke's, forwarding resolution that, in their opinion, the existing mode of election of members of Boards of Guardians is not consonant with the spirit of the age; is open to the commission of grave irregularities, and should be amended so as to render it analogous to the system adopted in the County Council Elections, the Guardians being elected for a term of three years. This Vestry agreed with the views expressed in such communication. Foreign Pauper Immigration.—On the receipt of a letter, dated 2nd July, from the Vestry 37 of Hammersmith, stating that, having considered the manifest evils of the continued importation of foreign paupers, they request the co-operation of the Vestry in taking the sense of the Metropolitan Ratepayers upon the subject, with a view to petitions being prepared, praying the Government to take the necessary steps to check the importation in question this Vestry passed a resolution expressing their opinion that some steps should be taken to check the continued immigration of foreign paupers into this country. Royal Academy.—The Vestry, in April, 1891, again decided to petition the Royal Academy to open their galleries on Saturday evenings during the Exhibition, from 7.30 to 11.0, as on the evenings of the last week of the Exhibition, and at the same admission fee of sixpence, and invited the the County Council, and the rest of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis to join them in the petition. The Secretary of the Royal Academy replied that nothing had occurred since 1889 (when the Vestry made a similar request) to lead them to alter the decision then arrived at, and which was then communicated to the Vestry, but that the whole matter was then most carefully considered, and the reasons which governed the decision then arrived at were such as no circumstances are likely to alter. The following Vestries and District Boards agreed to support the Petition:— Battersea Bermondsey Chelsea Hackney Hammersmith Holborn Islington Rotherhithe St. Giles St. James Westminster St. Luke St. Marylebone St. Pancras St. Saviour Shoreditch Strand D 38 The London County Council and the following Vestries and District Boards did not agree to support it:— Limehouse St Margaret and St. John, Westminster St. Mary Newington. Proposed Gallery of British Art.—A munificent but anonymous offer of £80,000 having been made to the Government to erect a gallery of British Art, the Vestry in April, 1891 decided to petition the Government to consider the claims of Central London in the selection of the site, and to invite the other central parishes to join in the petition. The Vestries of St. Luke, Islington, and Shoreditch, and the Holborn District Board of Works supported the action of the Vestry, and the Vestry of St. Pancras suggested the Thames Embankment. A reply was received from Mr. Goschen, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stating that the unknown donor's offer of the £80,000 for the purpose of erecting such a gallery was conditional, inter alia, on the adoption of the South Kensington site, and that therefore the Government had not a free choice in the matter. The Vestry replied to Mr. Goschen expressing regret at his communication, and also the hope that some means might be found to meet the wishes of the Vestry, the receipt of which Mr. Goschen acknowledged. Royal Commission on Labour.—The Vestry received in August, 1891, a circular letter from the Royal Commission on Labour, asking for information as to the conditions of work of the 39 Vestry's employes. The information was duly supplied in the following form:— No. employ ed. Class. Rate of Pay.

On the 22nd February a deputation, to which the Vestry sent delegates, had an interview with the Home Secretary upon the subject. Mr. Matthews replied that he would endeavour to devise some arrangements which will do justice to the residents in the outside districts and to the cab proprietors and drivers. Sadler's Wells Theatre.—At the Licensing Sessions in October, another application was made for the grant of a Music and Dancing license for Sadler's Wells Theatre. On the application in the previous year it will be remembered that the Vestry forwarded to the Council a strong expression of opinion that, on the removal of Deacon's Music Hall for the purposes of the new street, no other establishment of the kind would be allowed by the Council, and the license was then refused. The Vestry informed the applicants that they would again oppose the grant. The Licensing Committee of the Council recommended that the license be granted, but the Council again refused it. Telephone Companies.—In February, 1892, at the invitation of the Vestry of St. Margaret, Westminster, the Vestry appointed delegates to a meeting with the view of offering opposition to objectionable clauses in the National Telephone Company Bill, and the New Telephone Company 41 (Limited) Bill. The Conference passed the following resolutions:— That this Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards is of opinion that concerted action should be taken to watch and protect the interests of such authorities with reference to the Bills introduced in the present session of Parliament by the National Telephone Company, Limited, and the New Telephone Company, Limited. That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the various local authorities, and that they be asked to appoint a representative to act upon a Committee which shall consider how the concerted action can be rendered most effective; and that it be suggested that the representative should be authorised to co operate in giving effect to the proposed opposition to the Bills. The Vestry appointed Mr. Churchwarden Sans as their representative to act upon the proposed Committee, but without power to pledge the Vestry to expenditure in the matter. North Metropolitan Tramways (Rosebery Avenue Extension,)—The North Metropolitan Tramways Company submitted a scheme to Parliament proposing to extend their lines from High Street down St. John Street Road and Rosebery Avenue to the Holborn Town Hall. The Vestry, on the Company agreeing to pay to the Vestry a proper sum for the paving they would take to, to the extent of 18 inches outside their outer rails, gave its consent to the scheme, but in consequence of the conditions of consent imposed by the County Council, one of which was that the tramway should be deemed to be part of the undertaking authorised by the Company's Act of 1871, and so become purchasable by the Council in 1892, the application was not proceeded with. City and South London Railway (Islington Extension, &c.)—The Vestry also had before 42 them the plans of the City and South London Railway, (Islington Extension). The line, if constructed, would only affect a small part of the roadway in Clerkenwell at the Junction of City and Goswell Roads, and the Vestry gave its consent to the application. Electric Lighting.—In June letters were received from the Brush Electric Engineering Company, Messrs. Sharp & Kent, 34, Victoria Street, The County of London Electric Lighting Company, and the Camberwell and Islington Electric Light and Power Company, giving statutory notice of their respective intentions to apply to the Board of Trade for Provisional Orders to supply electricity within the area of the Parish of Clerkenwell. In October a letter was received from Mr. Sydney Morse, the Solicitor of the Brush Electrical Engineering Company, Limited, to which last Session a Provisional Order was granted, stating that by the terms of the order, separate accounts were to be kept by the undertakers, both of the capital employed in and the revenue resulting from such undertaking, and audited by a Public Officer, these accounts being also intended to be used in connection with a revision of the authorised price, under the 33rd Clause of the order, and that it is found in practice that these conditions can only be satisfactorily fulfilled by a Company not interested in any other business than the supply of electricity from central stations; that therefore the Brush Company having other business, had registered a Company under the name of the County of London Electric Lighting Company, Limited, for the purpose of carrying out the works, under the order granted last year to the Brush Electrical 43 Engineering Company, Limited, but that the Board of Trade had, however, stated in answer to an enquiry, that they will not authorise the transfer of any Electric Lighting Orders, and that a new Order must be applied for by the County of London Electric Lighting Company, Limited, and therefore he asked that the consent of the Vestry might be given to the application. Such consent was given, and the Board of Trade granted the new order. The Vestry also gave its consent to the application of the Camberwell and Islington Company, but the Order has not been proceeded with. Water Supply of the Metropolis.—The last report made mention of a Bill introduced into Parliament by an Executive Committee of delegates from Vestries and District Boards, for the purchase of the Water Companies' undertakings and for power to set up a competing supply, which Bill was with others on the same subject referred to a Committee of the House of Commons. This Committee gave their decision on the 26th June. They decided that the preamble of the Metropolis Water Supply Bill, which was promoted by the London Vestries, had not been proved, nor that of the London Water Commission Bill, promoted by the Corporation of London. Upon both these Bills the Committee decided to make a special report to the House. With reference to the application for costs, the Chairman stated that the Committee considered that both Bills had been promoted perfectly bona fide and with a view to advance the public interests, but they had no power to deal with the question of costs. It was further decided to report that upon the Metropolitan Water Companies' (Charges) Bill no evidence had been offered. 44 Clerkenwell Detached.—Last year's report upon this subject closed with a statement that the Vestry were again approaching the Friern Barnet Local Board, with the view to their taking the sewerage of Clerkenwell detached. That Board however raised its terms from 1s. in the £ upon eht rateable value, which it had previously provisionally agreed upon, to 1s. 6d., and the Vestry therefore did not feel that they could proceed farther in such negociations. Negociations continued at some length between the London County Council, the Hornsey Local Board, and the Vestry, and accordingly, in August, the Vestry's Surveyor reported that he had furnished to Mr. Meade, the Engineer of the Hornsey Local Board, a plan of the outlying district on the 25-in. Ordnance Sheet, showing the positions of the roads and the surface water drains, and read the following letter, which he had received thereon:— Hornsey Local Board, Southwood Lane, Highgate, N., 3lst August, 1891. Dear Sir, Re Drainage, Clerkenwell (Detached). I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 27th inst., together with the Ordnance Sheets numbered respectively xii. 1 and xii. 5, on which are marked the approximate positions of new roads, and certain blue lines indicating the positions of drains. It will, however, be necessary to submit further information for the consideration of my Board, viz., a survey to a larger scale, say at least 44 feet to the inch, shewing the roads and the houses drained by the dual system or otherwise, also the size, depth and inclination of the sewers for the conveyance of storm water; and the size, depth, and inclination of the sewers for the reception of sewage proper, together with all manholes, gullies, ventilators, &c., in connection 45 with the above. The object of my Board is, to see that provision is or will be made for the exclusion of surface water, as agreed between the late Sir Joseph Bazalgette and myself, on behalf of the Metropolitan Board of Works and this authority. Your faithfully, T. De COURCY MEADE, William Iron, Esq., Surveyor. Engineer and Surveyor. And the plan was accordingly ordered to he prepared. When it was ready, it was forwarded to the London County Council, but returned by them with the statement that it was for the Vestry to satisfy the Hornsey Local Board upon the point, and the tracings were accordingly sent to that Board. The Vestry were surprised to receive a reply from them, that they were prepared to receive any proposal that might be submitted to them by the London County Council, but that they did not desire to continue a discussion which had been going on with the Vestry for several years, and was not likely to have any useful result. During the year also, an Action was brought by the Friern Barnet Local Board against the Vestry, to restrain them from allowing the overflow of a cesspool in Wetherell Road to discharge into the brook which passes into the Friern Barnet district. Judgment was given in the case by Mr. Justice Romer on the 21st July. The injunction was refused, on the grounds that the Vestry having consented to the overflow of the cesspool into the surface water drain could not revoke that consent, and were therefore not in a position to comply with the E 46 Injunction if it were granted; that the plaintiffs, under the Public Health Act, had the power to take proceedings against the owner of the cesspool, and that the Court would not compel the Vestry to do what it was in the power of the Friern Barnet Local Board to do for themselves; and upon the Vestry giving an undertaking not to permit the attachment of the drainage of further houses to the surface water drain in question, the action was dismissed, without costs. The question of the maintenance of Colney Hatch Lane has engaged the attention of the Vestry during the year to a considerable extent. It will be remembered that the Hornsey Local Board made up the footway on their side, at the same time widening it to such an extent as to leave very little of the roadway in their Parish, and that they had then required a new basis of payment if they were to continue to keep the road in repair, the Vestry reimbursing them the expense of the Clerkenwell portion. It was ultimately agreed that the roadway should be made up by the Hornsey Local Board, payment being made by the Vestry according to the proportion of the total area in this Parish. Towards the close of the year, some of the inhabitants of Clerkenwell detached and Hornsey forwarded a petition to the Local Government Board calling attention to the state of the road, and the general question of the want of drainage, and urged the Local Government Board to use its powers for joining Clerkenwell detached to Hornsey, and they have intimated their intention to hold the necessary enquiry. 47 Meetings.—The following is a list of the number of Meetings of the Vestry and its Committees during the year:— Vestry 47 Works Committee 57 Wharf Committee 9 Joint Works and Sanitary Committee 1 Sub Works Committee 3 Sanitary Committee 26 Assessment Committee 15 Finance Committee 14 Parliamentary Committee 3 Special Committees 2 Petty Sessions 4 181 By Order, ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk, STATEMENT & ACCOUNT OF ??? ??? ??? ???

Dusting.—During the year 8995 loads of dust and 389 loads of trade refuse have been removed from the Parish. After sifting same, 137 freights of ashes and breeze, containing 8949 chaldrons have been removed from the "Wharf, for which a sum of £507 7s. 1d. has been received, being an average of £3 14s. Od. per freight, as compared with £3 3s. 9d., £3 6s. 4d., and £3 6s. 10d., for the three previous years. Thirty-four freights of hardcore have been removed, for which barges have been hired at a cost of £135 2s. 0d. Eight freights of rough dust have also been removed. 66 The following is a Statement of the cost of disposal of the dust for the year:— £ s. d. 9064 Loads of Dust sifted 810 6 7 Less Bags, Bones, &c., sold 172 9 5 £637 17 2 34 Freights of Hardcore removed £135 2 0 Cost of Loading same 34 0 0 Tools 5 10 0 174 12 0 812 9 2 8949 Chaldrons of Ashes and Breeze sold 516 13 9 Less Cost of Loading at 3d. per chaldron 111 17 3 404 16 6 Nett Cost £407 12 8 9064 Loads of Dust at £407 12s, 8d. is equal to 10¾d per load, being a reduction from last year of 3½d. per load, a result due to tlie direction of the Committee of the 14th July last, that the Superintendent insist upon each sifter sifting three loads per day. Street Sweepings.—During the year 7724 loads of street sweepings and dung were removed from the Parish, 872 of which were collected on Sunday mornings. 172 freights were barged away at a cost of £134 1s. 6d. Horses and vans have been hired of Mr. Stubbs during times of pressure, at a cost of £116 19s. 2d. This is principally attributable to the direction of the Vestry that the horses and vans used in dusting are not to be taken off that work when extra slopping is necessary. Watering.—Only a small part of the watering was done by the Vestry staff, but for 71 days, between April 15th and September 17th, an average of 7.4 horses per day were hired from Mr. Varney for the purpose at a cost of £240 9s. 0d. 67 Cartage.—The horses and carts have also been employed during the year in carting stone, refuse from 354 gullies, and rubbish. For cartage purposes, 63 horses, carts and men, and 20 for the sweeping machines have been hired during the year from Mr. Varney, at a cost of £54 11s. 2d. Horses.—The mare "Hill," which had become useless to the Vestry in consequence of lameness, was sold in June to Mr. Price, the Veterinary Surgeon, for £2, the Vestry having the option of re-purchasing at the same price, with the cost of keep added, should she recover sufficiently to work again. Two horses have been killed, "Goad" on the 17th October, which suffered from an injured back, and finally fell down and was unable to rise and which had been in the Vestry service since March, 1881; and "Cornwell," on the 16th February, its foot being pierced by the prong of a fork, and there being no hope of recovery. Four horses have been purchased during the year, one on the 15th October, one on the 10th December, and two on the 21st January, the number at the close of the year being 23. Vans and Carts.—Three vans have been purchased at a cost of £46 each. The number of vans and carts belonging to the Vestry is—16 vans, 8 carts, 12 water vans, and 2 sweeping machines. Fodder.—The Fodder account amounts to £927 17s. 6d., being an average of 16s. 1d. per horse per week, an increase from last year of 8d. per horse per week. The Net Expenditure for the year ended 25th March, 1892, is shown by the following amounts:— RECEIPTS. EXPENDITURE. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.

I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM IKON, Surveyor. 83 REPORT i OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1891. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I do myself the honour of laying before you my Thirtysixth Annual Report on the Mortality, &c., of the Parish during the year 1891. The number of deaths occurring from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1891 was 1,171. The annual average for the last ten years was 1,187, so that the deaths were 16 below the average. The deaths in 1890 having been 1,184, those in 1891 were 13 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— deaths. births 1882 1,261 2,420 1883 1,172 2,402 1884 1,303 2,448 1885 1,195 2,390 1886 1,170 2,279 1887 1,216 2,303 1888 1,168 2,311 1889 1,033 2,277 1890 1,184 2,204 1891 1,171 2,222 The births were 18 more than in the preceding year, but 109 below the average, 84 According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 338 560 222 Amwell 293 571 278 Pentonville 283 550 267 Goswell 257 541 284 In each year a number or deaths or parishioners takes place in General and Special Hospitals, in the Workhouses, in the Infirmary, and in Lunatic Asylums, all of which are extra-parochial. The number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals was 197; in the "Workhouses, 119; in the Infirmary, 125; and in Lunatic Asylums, 27; 7 deaths also occurred in the streets, or by drowning. I explained in my last Report, how, in all probability, the population found at the Census of 1891 was below the proper estimate, as so many houses had been pulled down just before the Census was taken; and during the last year other houses have been built, and a further increase of population has taken place. Taking, however, the population as found at the last Census, the intra-parochial mortality amounts to 17 per 1000; including the hospital deaths, 20; and including the workhouse and infirmary deaths, 24 per 1,000. It may be stated here, that at the last Census, the number of inhabitants in Clerkenwell was 65,885. Of these 32,624 were males, and 33,261 females. In the Registration Districts the particulars were as follows:— males. females. totals. St. James 8450 8353 16,803 Amwell 8277 8606 16,883 Pentonville 8413 8411 13,824 Goswell 7884 7891 15,375 The number of houses occupied by families living in them were: houses. families. St. James 2158 3995 Amwell 1876 4382 Pentonville 1504 3845 Goswell l825 4063 85 It should be remembered that there are 52 houses in the Muswell Hill portion of the Parish, containing 318 inhabitants. These are enumerated in the Pentonville District. The mortality of all London during the year was 21—That of the West Districts being 20; the North Districts, also 20; the Central Districts, 26; of the East Districts, 24; and of the South Districts, 19. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in the Parish in 1891, was 223; 51 more than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of the deaths from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last 10 years are exhibited in the following table:— small pox. measles. scaelet fever. diphtheeia. whping. cough. typhoid fevee. diaeehgsa. totals. 1882 0 61 50 10 81 18 40 260 1883 0 61 36 10 33 16 59 215 1884 6 48 15 12 69 7 79 236 1885 6 87 14 7 52 5 58 229 1886 0 18 8 4 42 7 93 172 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 1889 0 47 10 6 23 4 54 144 1890 0 33 5 2 64 6 62 172 1891 0 107 4 7 51 4 50 223 Sixty deaths also occurred from zymotic diseases in extraparochial hospitals; viz.:— 3 from measles; 24 from scarlet fever; 21 from diphtheria; 9 from typhoid fever; and 3 from diarrhcoa. 86 The average number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 209, so that the number for 1891 was 14 above the average. No case of Small Pox occurred during the year. The number of deaths from Measles was very considerably in excess of that in the previous year. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were about the same as in the preceding year, but the deaths of patients removed to hospitals were more numerous. The deaths from Diphtheria were also rather more numerous. The number of deaths arising from all causes in infants under 1 year of age was 351, rather less than last year; 24 also occurred in Extra-Parochial Hospitals. 196 deaths occurred in the Parish at and above 60, 132 in the Workhouses, &c.; making a total of 328. 32 deaths occurred from violence, 17 less than in the preceding year. 73 inquest deaths were registered in the year, 33 less than in the preceding year; 38 extra-parochial inquests upon parishioners were held. In 20 large English towns the mortality in 1891 was:—In London, 21.4; Brighton, 18.2; Portsmouth, 19; Norwich, 19.3; Plymouth, 22.5; Bristol, 20.9; Wolverhampton, 24.2; Birmingham, 22.2; Leicester, 21.7; Nottingham, 19.9; Liverpool, 27; Manchester, 26.5; Salford, 26; Oldham, 25.7; Bradford, 22.2; Leeds, 22.9; Sheffield, 23.9; Hull, 21; Sunderland, 25; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 23.8. In Edinburgh the mortality was 21.6; in Glasgow, 25.3; and in Dublin, 26.5 per 1000. 87 Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself on September 28th, prior to licensing. There were 9:4 in the Upper Wards, and 5 in the Lower, and were kept by 9 butchers. They were found in very good order, and no complaints were made of them during the year by the neighbours or others. Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 10; 5 in the Upper and 5 in the Lower Wards; and kept by the same number of cow-keepers. They were in very good order, and the animals were very fine and healthy; the cows were 106, 56 in the Upper Wards and 50 in the Lower. Bake-houses.—These were inspected twice in the year. They were 56 in number, 29 in the Upper Wards, and 27 in the Lower; they were in good condition. Housing of the Working Classes Act.—Action was taken in regard to these, as follows:— Stratton Place.—Three houses.—These houses are situated at the back of the houses at the west-end of Berkeley Street. The entrance is a long narrow covered passage, and the houses are walled in on all sides. Proceedings were taken before the Magistrate for a Closing Order; they were inspected by the Magistrate who ordered the middle one to be closed, but allowed the two outside ones to remain. The Magistrate evidently considered the question in regard to the condition of the houses, and not their enclosure by surrounding property. Clement's Court.—Here the house was faced by a high wall, the rooms very dark and the entrance through a long narrow passage. The Magistrate declined to make an order in this case also. 88 1 & 8, York Buildings.—These houses have been pulled down. 1-6, Victoria. Pla.ce.—Houses closed. At 4½, Little Bath Street, 43, St. Helena Place, 10, Thomas Street, 6, Suffolk Street, 9, William Street, and several houses in Mount Zion, Sermon Lane, the houses were in bad order, and the requisite improvements were effected. At 10, Thomas Street an Order was made for closing, but the tenants refused to quit until summoned before the Magistrate, who fined them. Bolton Court has been closed, but it should be cleared away. 6½, Bishop's Court, Caroline Place, and Union Court remain on hand, but after our experience of magisterial decision, there does not seem much hope of their being done away with, but further proceedings will be taken. Infectious Disease Notification.—651 notices of Infectious Disease were given in the year, 2 of Small Pox (these were only Chicken Pox); 319 of Scarlet Fever; 132 of Diphtheria; 68 of Typhoid Fever; 118 of Erysipelas; 10 of Membranous Croup and 2 of Puerperal Fever. This is an increase upon the numbers for the preceding year, when the notifications were 596. No second case of Erysipelas occurred in any house. In fact this disease is not infectious in the same manner as the other infectious diseases are, requiring foul rooms and surroundings, which do not occur in this Parish; and it might well be omitted from the list, especially as the Parish is now undergoing a regular house-to-house inspection. The localities in which the notified cases of infectious diseases occurred are shown in the following table:— 89  Scarlet Fever Diphtheria Typhoid Fever Scarlet Fever Diphtheria Typhoid Fever .ffleck Street 5 Chapel Place ???hemarle Street 5 2 Chapel Row 1 1 ???bion Place 1 Chapel Street 5 ???llen Street 1 Charles Street Lower 1 ???lpha Place Charles Street Upper 5 ???mwell Street 2 Charlotte Place ???ngel Mews Charter Buildings 1 ???nn Street Claremont Mews 1 ???nn's Place Claremont Square 3 Arlington Street Clark Street Asbby Street 1 1 Clerkenwell Close Aylesbury Place Clerkenwell Green 2 Aylesbry Street 1 1 Clerkenwell Road 1 1 1 Baker Street 1 Cobden Buildings Baker's Row 1 2 1 Cobourg Street 1 Barnard Hill, Mnswell Hill Cold Bath Buildings 2 Cold Bath Square 1 Baron Street 2 Collier Place Bath Court Collier Street 3 1 Bath Row Colney Hatch Lane Bath Street 3 1 Compton Buildings 10 5 Bath Street (Little) Compton Passage Berkley Court 3 Compton Street 2 Berkley Street 4 2 Corporation Buildings 3 2 1 Berry Street Corporation Row Birkbeck Road, Muswell Hill Crawford Passage Crawford Place Bishop's Court 1 Crescent Place Bolton Place Cumberland Terrace Bond Street Cumming Street 3 1 Bowling Green Lane 2 1 Cynthia Street 2 Brewer's Buildings 3 1 Cyrus Street Brewer Street 4 1 1 Douglas Place 1 Do.

Factories and Workshops.—These are now being carefully inspected, as required by the Public Health Act It may be well to state Mr. Lakeman's definitions in this matter as contained in his subjoined letter:— Home Office, Whitehall, October 2nd, 1892. Sib, As requested by your letter of the 28th July, I beg to inform you that a "Factory" is any place wherein motive power is used for the manufacture of any article, and a workshop is a place wherein manual labour only is used. But a workshop wherein male adults only are employed is not considered to be in any way subject to the jurisdiction of the Factory Inspector. Your obedient servant, J. B. LAKEMAN. Mortuary.—The excellent Mortuary still continues to fulfil, in the main, its most useful purpose. 259 bodies were brought into it during the year; of these 76 were Holborn Guardians cases; and 183 were brought from the dwellings of parishioners, including 11 cases of Zymotic disease, and 75 were for inquest purposes, upon which 33 post-mortems were made. In a few instances trouble and annoyance are caused by a defective state of the law. The regulations of the Vestry require that no body shall be retained in the mortuary for more than five days. The Public Health Act empowers the magistrate to make an order for the removal of a body when in a decomposing state from any dwelling to the mortuary, and for its burial within an appointed time. But when a body has been removed to the mortuary and remains there unburied so as to become very offensive; on application to the magistrate for an order for its burial, this has beea refused iu two 00 cases, so that wo have been powerless to prevent a great nuisance. It is the duty of the relieving officer to cause the burial of bodies when the friends cannot do so. But what is wanted, is magisterial power to order the burial of any body, when in a decomposed state, wherever it may be, and at a certain time. The Meteorology of the year was as follows :— 1891. temperature. average. difference from average of 120 tears. humidity (saturation=100.) height of barometer. rain in inches. difference from average of 75 tears.

"The Clerk called attention to the fact that "since the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor "Rate, which duty had reverted to the Guardians "or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, "and which Board has been revived for the purpose "in November, 1871, there was no Poor Rate "Account published, except the remainder of those "in collection by the Vestry previous to that time, "and suggested whether it would not be desirable, "by an agreement between both Boards, to publish "the Poor Rate Account of the Guardians or "Governors as an appendix to the Annual Reports "of the Vestry, in which case there would be one "and a half years Poor Rate Account to be "appended to the Report about to be issued for the "year ended Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by "Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved "and adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes). R. E. PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
