Tel: BRIxton 7755 the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors °f the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth Mr. .Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1964. This is the last report for a full year for fte Metropolitan Borough, as on 1st April, 1965, the London Borough of Lambeth came into being, covering an area about half as large again as that to which this report refers. The Metropolitan Borough was instituted on 1st November, 1900 as a result the London Government Act 1899 but the boundaries were practically identical Wlth those of the Vestry which preceded it. The first Medical Officer of Health was appointed on 1st February, 1856 and 10 1857 his first annual report was recorded on two pages of the Annual Report the proceedings of the Vestry. This, together with a list of Medical Officers Health of the Vestry and Metropolitan Borough, is reproduced on pages 11 and This is therefore the sixty-fourth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of ®lth for the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth and the one hundred and ninth for the area until recently comprising that Borough. As I high-lighted some of the changes in the first hundred years in my annual tePort for 1956, I do not propose to repeat them here. The various vital statistics for the Borough show little change from those of ast year and are commented on in the body of the report. The shortage of public health inspectors has continued and the borough 'ins a student training scheme but the staff likely to be obtained in this way tely replaces losses due to retirement. To offset this shortage of inspectors and to carry out duties in connection **th houses-in-multiple occupation the Council authorised the appointment of four c«nical assistants similar to those already employed on Smoke Control. 10 In conclusion I am pleased to acknowledge the support given to me by members of the Council and of the Public Health Committee in particular. My thanks are due also to the other Chief Officers of the Council for their co-operation during the year and to the members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal and conscientious service. I am,, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F.

SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS On the 3rd day of April, 1856, the Medical Officer of Health made his First Report to the General Purposes Committee.. By the 27th day of March, 1857, ^ere had been brought under the consideration of the Committee, by the Medical Officer and two Inspectors, 1629 cases of nuisance. With regard to the nature of the above-mentioned nuisances, 846 cases referred 0 the unwholesome condition of 1964 dwelling-houses, forming nearly one-tenth PQrt of the total number of inhabited houses that existed in the Parish at the Period of the last census in 1851. In all these cases improvements to a greater or less extent have been effected, nese improvements have related principally to the state of the Drainage, to the ater Supply, to the condition of cleanliness, dryness, and repair, and to the ®«ans for enclosing domestic refuse. 12 There have been 22 cases of nuisance, arising from offensive trades.. The investigation of these cases, and the frequent supervision of the premises to which they refer, have occupied much of the time of the Medical Officer. The remaining 761 miscellaneous cases pertain to a variety of subjects; such, for instance, as offensive ditches and drains, foul urinals, piggeries, cow-sheds and slaughter-houses, accumulations of filth and refuse. The following Tabular Statement shows the operations of the Vestty, with reference to Nuisances, &c.- Return shewing the number and nature of Nuisances complained of in the Parish of Lambeth, and the steps taken to remove or abate the same with the Results, from 9th of February, 1856, to the 25th March, 1857.

No* of cases for each class in which Summons-es were taken out* No* of cases of each class in which Magistrates' Orders for abatement were made. REMARKS Foul Privies 1186 758 802 384 329 In consequence of an objection by the Magistrates to make Orders for necessary Constructive Works, the process of Summonses for such purposes was discontinued in 1856* In all subsequent cases, in which Constructive Works were requisite for effecting Sanitary improvements, the Vestry has issued its Orders for carrying the same into execution.

It has common boundaries with Battersea, Wandsworth, Croydon, Penge, Camberwell, Southwark and the Cities of London and Westminster. The total area of the Borough is .approximately 654 square miles. This area excludes tidal Water and foreshore, but includes approximately five acres which have been added to the Borough as a result of the new South Bank embankment, part of the fiver area have been reclaimed. The land surface rises from 12 feet above sea-level at the river to 50 feet at Brixton, 150 feet at West Norwood and about 379 feet at and near the Crystal Palace.. The perimeter of the Borough measures W/i miles. The Borough has approximately 328 acres of open space, including Brockwel), Bennington, Ruskin, Norwood, Archbishop's and Vauxhall Parks and Myatt's fields. Among the world famous buildings within the boundaries are Lambeth Palace, Oval cricket ground, the County Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and the ad quarters of the London Fire Brigade. Lambeth is divided into three Parliamentary Divisions, Vauxhall, Brixton Norwood, each returning one member of Parliament and three members to the J-*°ndon County Council. These Divisions are, in turn, divided into a total of * Wards for the purpose of Borough Council elections. 14 STATISTICS GENERAL Area of Borough 4,087.5 acres No. of Wards 21 Nol of Parliamentary Constituencies 3 Population Figure supplied by Registrar General (Mid-year estimate 1964) 223,140 Population figure Census 1961 223,763 Density of Population i.e. number of Persons per acre (Based on Registrar-General's Estimated Population) 54.6 Number of marriages during year 1,923 Marriage rate per 1,000 Population 8.6 Rateable Value of District (1st April, 1964) £13,781,243 Sum represented by Penny Rate (1964/65) £55,300 Number of separately rated houses and flats at 1st April, 1964 57,198 BIRTHS Live Births Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 2,477 484 2,961 Females 2,184 459 2,643 Totals 4,661 943 5,604 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 25.11 Birth Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 22.10 Comparability Factor supplied by Registrar General 0.88 13 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population County of London 19.9 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population England and Wales 18.4 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1963 22.01 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total live births 16.8% STILL BIRTHS Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 39 6 45 Females 31 7 38 Totals 70 13 83 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Total Births (i.e. live and still) 14.6 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 0.37 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Total Births England and Wales 16.3 DEATHS Males Females Total 1,274 1,143 2,417 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population 10.83 Death Rate'corrected for comparison with other areas 12.13 Comparability Factor supplied by Registrar General 1.12 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population England and Wales 11.3 16 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1963 13.71 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population County of London 11.0 MATERNAL MORTALITY Number of Women dying in consequence of childbirth 3 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births 0.52 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births County of London 0.36 INFANTILE MORTALITY Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 62 18 80 Females 31 9 40 Totals 93 27 120 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births 21.41 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births County of London 21.3 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 20.0 Legitimate Infantile Mortality rate 19.95 Illegitimate Infantile Mortality rate 28.8 17 Deaths of Infants under 4 weeks of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 39 13 52 Females 16 7 23 Totals 55 20 75 Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under four weeks per 1,000 live births) 13.38 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births County of London 14.9 Deaths of Infants under 1 week of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 33 13 46 Females 13 6 19 Totals 46 19 65 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under one week per 1,000 live births) 11.59 Perinatal Mortality Rate (Stillbirths and deaths under one week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) 26.02 18 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTIGS FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD 1935 - 1964 Year Population Deaths * Death Rate Live Births * Live Births Rate Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age Infantile Mortality Rate Maternal Deaths Maternal Mortality Rate 1955 224,200 2,385 10.74 3,597 14.12 74 20.57 4 1.08 1956 223,900 2,389 11.10 3,915 15.74 83 21.20 1 .25 1957 224,300 2,359 10.83 4,205 16.82 98 23.90 NIL NIL 1958 223,600 2,529 11.65 4,444 17.12 111 24.98 1 .22 1959 223,300 2,483 11.38 4,685 19.09 116 24.76 1 .21 1960 224,080 2,388 10.86 4,802 19.55 101 21.0 2 .41 1961 221,960 2,585 11.65 4,847 19.87 109 22.41 3 .61 1962 223,370 2,479 11.10 5,329 21.94 102 19.15 5 .92 1963 223,120 2,732 13.71 5,580 22.01 141 25.27 3 .53 1964 223,140 2,417 12.13 5,604 22.10 120 21.41 3 .52 * As adjusted by Comparability Factor 19 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH CAUSES OF death AT DIFFERENT periods of life during 1964 CAUSE OF DEATH Sex Total All ages Under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 1 year AGE IN YEARS 1- 5- 15- 25- 35- 45- 55- 65- 75 and over 1.

This is an increase of 20 over the mid-year estimate for 1963. Although the increase over the previous year is only 20, the natural increase, i.e., the excess of births over deaths, is 3,187. This would appear to indicate a movement of residents out of the Borough this trend has been apparent over the last ten years. Although it is realised that the population figure is an estimate, one wonders how realistic this figure is in the light of the housing shortage, over occupation of property and the immigrant population in the Borough. births The number of births increased by 24 giving a corrected birth rate of 22.10 compared with 22.01 in 1963.. This rate is the highest since the post war peak year of 1947. The illegitimate births declined, 943 occurring compared with 979 last year. Although it is pleasing to note this reduction the percentage for the Borough is still high and illegitimacy presents a social problem.. still births Five fewer still births occurred giving a still birth rate per 1,000 total births of 14.6 compared with 15.5 in 1963. deaths The total number of deaths was 2,417. Males 1,274 and females 1,143.. This is a decrease of 315 on the figure for 1963 and gives a corrected death rate of 10.83 compared with 13.71 last year. As is usual heart and associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths . Malignant Neoplasms of all forms ranked second in the causes of death. Fatalities from all forms of tuberculosis were fewer than in 1963,18 occurring compared with 22. Deaths from motor vehicle accidents increased from 32 in 1963 to 36 this year but the number of people taking their own life fell from 49 last year to 39 in 1964. Men were more prone to suicide than women. 23 infantile mortality The number of infants who died in the first year of life was 120. This was 21 fewer than in 1963, giving an infantile mortality rate of 21.41 per 1,000 live births compared with 25.27 last year. Seventy Five of the deaths occurred in children under the age of 4 weeks giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 13-38, an improvement on last year. The early neo-natal mortality rate was 11.59 also an improvement on the figure for 1963. The causes of death fell into the under-mentioned categories. Cause of Death Male Female Total Leukaemia, Aleukaemia 1 - 1 lnfluenza - 1 1 Pneumonia 12 8 20 Bronchitis 5 1 6 Other diseases of Respiratory System 1 - 1 Gastritis, Enteritis, Diarrhoea 1 1 2 Congenital Malformations 14 10 24 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 41 17 58 Accidents 4 2 6 Homicide 1 - 1 80 40 120 MAternal mortality rate As in 1963, three women died as a result of childbirth giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.52 per 1,000 total births. DEATHS from cancer of the lung and bronchus It is pleasing to note that the number of deaths from this cause fell during 1964. One hundred and fifty deaths, 120 males and 30 females, occurred compared with 174 last year.. 24 The deaths were split amongst the various age groups as follows Males Females Total 25-44 years 2 (5) 1 (1) 3 (6) 45-64 years 58 (66) 7 (13) 65 (79) 65-75 years 41 (50) 14 (13) 55 (63) 75 years and over 19 (17) 8 (9) 27 (26) 120 (138) 30 (36) 150 (174) The figures in brackets are those for the year 1963. During the last 15 years, 1,920 people have died from Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus, whilst over the same period 543 deaths have occurred from respiratory tuberculosis. 25 comparison of deaths from respiratory tuberculosis and cancer of lung and bronchu Cancer of Lung and Bronchus Respiratory Tuberculosis 26 road traffic accidents The following tables show the road traffic accidents occurring within the Borough of Lambeth during the year 1964 and the comparative figures and casualties for the period 1955-1964. The figures shown refer not only to Lambeth residents but also to persons living in other areas who were involved in accidents in the Borough. The number of fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those in the list of causes of death supplied by the Registrar-General. The Registrar-General's figures refer to Lambeth residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Lambeth or outside the district. My thanks are due to the Town Clerk for supplying me with the figures. 27 record of traffic accidents for 1964 within the borough of lambeth.

In fact the number was less than half that for the year 1963. This is Probably due to the fact that in that year an outbreak of measles occurred. Five diseases, namely, Scarlet Fever, Meningococcal Infection. Erysipelas, Puerperal Pyrexia and Ophthalmia Neonatorum showed increased incidence, others a reduction on the figures for 1963. No cases of Poliomyelitis were reported during the year. Food Poisoning There were five notified cses of food poisoning and they were distributed throughout the year as follows :- First Quarter Nil Second Quarter NIL Third Quarter 2 Fourth Quarter 3 5 In all cases the causative agent was not identified.. There was a food poisoning outbreak amongst the staff of a large office block in the Borough. The outbreak, which occurred from 3rd to 4th December, 1964, was a mild one and 30 employees were affected. The duration of the illness was 2-3 hours, three Persons were off work, and one was sent home. The average interval ingestion to onset was twelve hours and the main symptoms were abdominal pains and diarrhoea, minimal vomiting and nausea. Each of the employees affected ate a chicken omelette for their mid-day meal on December 3rd. This was the only common factor in the meal. Altogether two hundred and sixty people ate omeletters but only the 30 employees concerned had significant symptoms. The whole of the cooking processes were investigated, and any cause within the procedures used in the kitchen could be reasonably ruled out. The chefs handling the food were investigated and faecal specimens proved negative. The egg used in the preParation of the omelettes was a mixture of shell eggs and frozen egg, with a Predominance of the latter.. As a result of the investigations outlined above it was thought that the outbreak may have been due to infected bulked frozen egg. Unfortunately however none of the original chicken or frozen egg used in the Reparation of the food remained for testing. None of the cases were notified. 34 Salmonella Infections not Food-Borne In addition to the notified cases and the outbreak of food-poisoning already mentioned the following Salmonella Infections were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. Salmonella Type Number of Outbreaks No. of cases involved in outbreaks No. .of single cases Total No., of cases Family Other Adelaide 1 1 Brandenburg 3 3 Newport 1 1 Panama 1 2 1 3 Typhi-Murium 1 3 5 8 TOTAL 2 5 11 16 Typhoid Fever Two notifications of typhoid fever were received during the year. The first concerned a man employed by the London County Council meals service as a driver. The organism was isolated as a result of examination following an outbreak of diarrhoea. The man's illness was short but he continued to excrete typhoid bacilli in spite of treatment over a period of some months. It was considered that he was a carrier and his diarrhoea was not in fact attributable to typhoid. In view of the persistence of his carrier state he was advised to have surgical treatment, which he did, and after a somewhat stormy post-operative period returned to work cured of his carrier state. No secondary cases occurred from this man. The second notification was in an Italian woman who lived in a flat in the Borough. The family had been to Italy for a holiday to stay with relatives on a farm where the water supply and sewage disposal were stated to be. in close proximity. The woman had been taken ill on the way back to this Country. The husband was a waiter and various friends and relatives had visited her and looked after her prior to removal to hospital. These were all traced and investigated with negative results. There were no secondary cases from this patient. 35 borough of lambeth immunisation - 1964 Completed Cases Welfare Centres and Nurseries General Practitioners Totals Under 5 years 5- 14 years Under 5 years 5-14 years Diphtheria Prophylaxis only 1 53 - 4 58 Combined Antigen Diphtheria and whooping Cough — — — — — Triple Antigen Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus 3,745 18 797 34 4,594 Diphtheria and Tetanus 78 207 3 6 294 Diphtheria - boosting does-all ages 4,262 968 5,230 Whooping Cough only all ages (completed cases) — 1 1 Diphtheria immunisation is the responsibility of the London County Council, but may also be carried out by general practitioners and I am indebted to Dr. W.H.S. Wallace, Divisional Medical Office, of Division 8 for supplying me with the above figures. international certificates of vaccination International Certificates of vaccination for persons travelling to certain countries abroad are required in respect of Smallpox, Yellow Fever and Cholera. Vaccination against any disease other than yellow fever can be done by a Person's own doctor, or exceptionally (by arrangement) at a hospital. So long as vaccination is done under the National Health Service, whether by a person's own doctor or at a hospital, no charge may be made for it, but in either case the coctor may charge for issuing an International Certificate. 36 Yellow fever vaccination must, for international and technical reasons, be done only at a Centre designated by the Government, in London the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 4, St. Pancras Way, N.W.I., Medical Department, Unilever House, Blackfriars, E.C.4., and West London Designated Vaccinating Centre, 53, Great Cumberland Place, W.l. An International Certificate of vaccination against yellow fever will be supplied, after vaccination, at the Centre at which the vaccination is done. The International Certificates for smallpox and cholera (for completion by the person's own doctor) must be obtained by the traveller himself and taken to the doctor, it is NOT for the Doctor, or a Local Authority, or their Medical Officer of Health, to supply them. The forms can usually be obtained by the traveller from the Company arranging his transport, or he can get them from the Ministry of Health, Alexander Fleming House, Elephant and Castle, S.E.1. After completion by the vaccinator, certificates must be franked with an approved stamp. Approved stamps have been prescribed for the United Kingdom. If the vaccinator is not himself an authorised user of a stamp, the person vaccinated must take or send the certificate for stamping to a local Authority. In England and Wales this is the Town Hall, Urban District Council of Rural District in whose area the vaccinator practices. It should be noted that this is not necessarily the area in which the person vaccinated lives. During the year 3,152 International Certificates of Vaccination were stamped by the Public Health Department. 37 TUBERCULOSIS Notification The following table shows the number of cases of tuberculosis notified for the first time during the year 1964 excluding transfers into the district and cases brought to notice other than by formal notification.

This is more 42 accurately shown in the following Table IA which is a record of cases first diagnosed during the year and formally notified under the Tuberculosis Regulations. These figures refer only to that part of Lambeth which is in the South East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board area, served by the Chest Clinic in St. Francis' Hospital. TABLE IA Respiratory Tuberculosis Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis Men Women Children Total Men Women Children Total Number of Cases diagnosed during the year 1964 29 11 6 46 4 2 - 6 Deaths 9 1 1 11 - - - * Deaths There were 11 deaths including 9 men, 1 woman and 1 child. The one female death occurred in a case suffering from irreversible lung damage originally caused by severe tuberculosis contracted some fifteen years previously before chemotherapy was available.. The child was a case of miliary tuberculosis, diagnosed after death, occurring in the illegitimate infant of a tuberculous mother unaware of her disease until it was discovered when she was examined as a contact. Of the male deaths, the majority were in the older age groups and most had other contributory diseases. Three were inmates of the tuberculosis hostel at Knight's Hill - men without a fixed home who had been wanderers and had not shown good co-operation in treatment. Cancer of the respiratory tract was the ultimate cause of death in two cases and in the others - bronchitis, cardiac failure and senility. Tuberculosis Incidence For the first time in six years there was no reduction in the number of notified cases diagnoised during the year. Respiratory cases numbered 46 - the same as last year - there were 6 non-respiratory cases and one of fatal miliary disease previously mentioned. The non-respiratory cases were all secondary to a Previous lung infection and none was due to bovine infection. The distribution of incidence followed the trend of recent years - more than twice as many male cases as female and the majority in the over 40 age group. A small percentage of cases was discovered by mass radiography examination, but the majority were diagnosed at the Chest Clinic or at hospitals to where they had been referred by general practitioners for further investigation and advice. 43 Five cases only were referred at an advanced stage of disease - Group III Table I, all others in Groups I and II were diagnosed at an early or moderately advanced stage with good prospects of recovery under treatment.

Treatment The majority of new cases included in Table 2 were given treatment initially in hospital subsequently continuing chemo-therapy as out-patients. A small number of chronic suffering relapse were re-admitted to hospital - some to the tuberculosis ward in Dulwich Hospital where an average of 18 beds were occupied. Of these, 5 were kept occupied by patients from the Tuberculosis Hostel for men at Knight's Hill. There were 60 hospital admissions during the year and 94 out-patients under active chemo-therapy. B.C.G. vaccination was given to contacts at special risk including new-borns and children not yet old enough to be included in the London County Council's programme for routine B.C.G. vaccination of school children. 44 Health Visiting The London County Council provided 2 full time Tuberculosis Health Visitors working from the Chest Clinic at St. Francis' Hospital to cover duties in the South Lambeth area and 3,900 visits were made to patients' homes during the year. Welfare The needs of most patients were met by National Insurance and National Assistance with whose officers close liaison was maintained. As necessary; however, extra nourishment was provided by the London County Council on the Chest Physician's recommendation and 42 patients were supplied with milk, butter and eggs in kind. In necessitous cases and where there was special urgent need, help was given from the Chest Clinic Samaritan Fund supported by the Mayor of Lambeth, under the chairmanship of the Consultant Chest Physician. The day to day administration of the fund and care of patients' welfare continued to be the responsibility of the Chest Physician's Secretary, who is also Secretary to the Samaritan Fund Committee and during the year assistance was given to 140 patients. 45 section c general provision of health services for the area Care of the Aged This work continued to expand and the number of visits made by the two visitors increased by 1,394. During the year 769 new cases were brought to the notice of the Public Health department, an increase of 185 over the number of new cases for 1963. The age groups into which these new cases were divided were as follows Male Female Totals 60-69 years 61 93 154 70-74 years 48 95 143 75-79 years 52 122 174 80-84 years 50 108 158 85-89 years 26 78 104 90-94 years 9 24 33 95 years and over 1 2 3 247 522 769 The total number of visits made during the year was 5,211. The number of old people persuaded to enter hospital and insitutions Voluntarily was 274. It was not found necessary to use power under National Assistance Act 1948 or the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951. Credit is due to the two lady visitors for this In addition a total of 650 persons received help in some form or another. The number of cases on the register, including those from previous years is 3,026 Laundry Service for Aged Incontinent the arrangement made with Southwark Borough Council for carrying out this service continued during the year. 46 The total number of persons receiving benefit from the Scheme during the year was 196 (161), the total visits made were 3,736 (3,087) and the total number of soiled articles collected and taken to Southwark Cleansing Station was 43,362 (37,516). The total weight of the laundry cleansed was 32,919 (28,092) lbs. The figures given in brackets are those for the year 1963. Home Bathing Service An increasing number of aged persons are benefiting from this service, and during the year 2,805 baths were given. Old People's Holidays 1964 During May and September 1964, four hundred and sixty five old people were taken by coach to Margate for a week's holiday. Two hundred and seventy five old folk went during four weeks in the Spring and one hundred and ninety during three weeks in the Autumn. His Worship the Mayor, The Mayoress and The Chairman of the Public Health Committee saw some of the parties off,, and also visited some during their stay at Margate. Letters of appreciation have been received from the olk folk and at a reunion held in December, 1964, the majority expressed their thanks for a very good holiday. 47 OLD PEOPLE'S HOLIDAYS 1964 SPRING Males Females Totals M/C * 65/70 71/80 81 and over 60/70 71/80 81 and over Vauxhall 6 13 7 21 40 5 92 12 Brixton 8 17 4 25 49 13 116 22 Norwood 3 13 8 12 18 13 67 6 Totals 17 43 19 58 107 31 275 40 AUTUMN Vauxhall 5 10 2 7 15 3 42 6 Brixton 5 9 4 19 29 7 73 9 Norwood 4 9 5 15 34 8 75 16 Totals 14 28 11 41 78 18 190 31 * Married couples included in totals. 48 I am indebted to the Chairman and Members of the Executive Committee of the Lambeth Old People's Welfare Association for allowing me to include the following report on the activities of the Association. It should be noted that the Association's year covers the period from 1st April, 1964 to 31st March, 1965 and therefore does not co-incide strictly with the period covered by my Annual Report. REPORT The reaching of retirement age may mean loss of paid employment, but it should not mean an abrupt transition from being a contributor to feeling a dependent and helpless member of the community. Happily, the giving up of the ties and responsibilities of full-time employment means the opening of doors to new interests and experiences; and the aim of the Old People's Welfare Association is to study the needs of old people and to encourage provision of a better quality of life for all the elderly. During the year emphasis has been on the need for voluntary help, and there has been a great response from people all over the Borough offering to visit a lonely old person. We are hoping to set up many small groups of volunteers with a leader, and we already have three groups operating. We also have established groups in four schools, and several youth clubs. Youth helping age has been a popular theme with the press recently and the idea has been put forward that this is something new. This is not so, in 1950 the National Old People's Welfare Council published a pamphlet "Youth Helps Age" and during the past ten years there have been a number of conferences between Youth Organisations and Old People's Welfare Committees. Much valuable work has been done and some organised youth groups have been successful in giving regular services. Usually, however,, short-term projects, such as re-decorating or tidying up neglected gardens are most likely to succeed, and these are the jobs which can be given to schools. Requests for help are many and varied, from taking a dog out each day its aged owner is ill, to taking an old person to visit his or her partner in hospital From claiming from a bag-wash company for lost washing to helping someone to claim against the London Transport Executive for an injury received while mounting a bus. Visiting During the year, the six Welfare Visitors appointed to the Staff ot the Association have dealt with 12,700 enquiries and made 5,716 visits. For the most efficient working the Borough has been divided into six districts, and each Visitor has his or her own district. The task of the Welfare Visitor is not only to visit the old people, but also to unite all the voluntary effort within the district. By this division, the Association is endeavouring to break down the Borough sizeable areas, and so introduce a more friendly, village like community attitude in the districts. It is already meeting with great success in this direction. 49 Meals - on - Wheels Service The demands on this service seem to be ever-increasing, and during the year 1964-1965 there was another considerable rise in the number of meals suplied. of the total of 107,870 meals supplied, the W.V.S. delivered 31,871 and remaining 75,999 by the Association's own vans. The year under review saw three rounds taken over from the W.V.S., one early and one late in November 1964, and the third early in the New year. The Service is now operating from three kitchens, viz. the Town Hall canteen, Springfield Hall Kitchen and Benson House Restaurant. Luncheon Clubs During the year, progress has been made in the development of Luncheon Clubs. Four new Luncheon Clubs have opened, i.e., The Lowden Luncheon Club, St. John's Hall, Lowden Road, S.E.24. St. Anne's Luncheon Club, 461 Harleyford Road, Kennington, S.E.ll. Trinity Luncheon Club, St..Matthews Road, S.W.2.. Westow Luncheon Club, Westow Hill, Upper Norwood, with an average daily attendance of 54. This brings the number of Centres in the Borough providing meals for the mobile elderly person, at the same price as the person receiving Meals-on-Wheels, to seven. It is hoped that another club at Pelham Hall, China Walk, S.E.ll. will be opening in the very near future. These Lunche on Clubs not only enable old age pensioners to have a good cooked dinner every day, but they offer an opportunity for the older people to make social contact with others in similar circumstances, and to enjoy the pleasure of eating in the company of others. Chiropody A very comprehensive Chiropody Service is in operation.. There are seven clinics in various parts of the Borough for those who can walk to them, transport provided for those unable to walk, and for those unable to leave their homes, a visiting service is provided. There is an average of 19,970 treatments given year. Many old people are home-bound because of bad feet conditions, a 50 is often a joy to see an old person walk into a clinic who, previous to chiropody treatment, had been completely home-bound. The Association would like to thank all the chiropodists who continue to give such valuable service in alleviating one of the main needs of the elderly and to thank all the receptionists who give their unfailing voluntary help to the chiropody service. Boarding-out Scheme This Service has proved of value to a limited number of old people, but its progress is slow. In some cases it has proved satisfactory, but in other cases the old person has not been acceptable to the hostess, or vice-versa. Many families are not prepared to accept an old person into their home because of the fear of their becoming more infirm and needing much more attention than they are prepared to give; this is one of the difficulties which we have to try to overcome. We would repeat what was said when this Service was introduced - the success of it can never be judged by numbers; it is a work that needs infinite patience and care, and the delicate matching up of the elderly person and hostess cannot be hurried. There is a tremendous amount to be done in this field because so many old people are living the closing years of their life in loneliness and isolation, but one wonders whether the answer is the need to concentrate on providing more independent quarters - for example, a bed-sitting room with some cooking facilities. Everyone likes their own independence sometimes, and this seems the ideal way of providing it. Lambeth Centre for the Elderly This purpose built unit caters for the needs of the elderly living in close proximity to the centre.. It is a two storey building with the workrooms on ground floor. The second floor is used mainly as a rest or recreation centre. At the time of going to press, we had 58 on the roll (51 women, 7 men) During the past year we have had more varied jobs. Work has included assembling dolls' clothing on cards for a well-known toy manufacturer; packing foil wrapped chocolates into plastic containers for export; and various kinds of advertising literature. This greater variety of work is much appreciated by the old People All members received a food parcel at Christmas. The traditional dinner was held on New Years Day at which the Chairman presided. Games were organised in the lounge after lunch when members competed for prizes. This was followed by tea, sandwich and cakes. A happy time was had by all. We have had two outings this year, one full day and one half day, and in spite of poor weather, the members enjoyed themselves. At the Annual Conference of the Employment Fellowship a very colourful and varied display of work was shown from the Centre. Many enquiries were made from people who were about to start similar Centres in their own districts. 51 Clubs There are 29 Clubs, some meeting once a week, others two or three times, and all play a very vital part in the health and social well being of the old people in the Borough. Old People, when they are first introduced to a Club, may be very lonely unhappy, feeling that there is very little left in life; before long they have cemented friendships and find their lives very full. handicrafts are part of the club holidays,, and within the Clubs, Bingo, cards, fifteen application for monetary activities. During the year under review, fifteen application for monetary help with rent, purchase of equipment, fees, entertainment expenses, have been received, and not one application for help has been turned down. The Association would like to take the opportunity of publicly thanking all the club lesders and their helpers few their untiring efforts in making their Clubs such brith and happy places for so many lonely old people, and for their Whole-hearted support in all the work done for the senior citizens of the Borough. Inter-Club Competition and Exhibition of Work On Tuesday, 13 October, a very fine exhibition of work was on display in the Assembly Hall. record number of entries was received from Clubs, and included in a cookery section were home made jams and wines. The judging was, once again, in the capable hands of Miss Cuthbertson, the Principal of the Stockwell and Waterloo Institute, assisted by her deputy, Mr. E.C. Thompson and Miss King. The cookery entries were judged by Miss Thacker, of the South Eastern Gas Board, and our grateful thanks are due to all the judges for the care with which they examined very entry. Thanks are due to the the Mayor and Mayoress, who attended and distributed the prizes; the Competition Shield, which had been held for several years by the Springfield Club, was won by the Ruskin Club, Church Hall, Railton Road, S.E.24. Borough Talent Contest A afternoon was held in the Assembly Hall on March 30th, when five werepresented among the six entries.. The judging was carried out by the Mayor and Mayoreass assisted by Mrs. Marjorie Jarvis.. Mrs. Dimmock of St..Anne's Club, Vauxhall, was again the successful competitor. Christmas Concert On the 17th December, another successful Evening Concert was given by the Chatworth Choir and Works Band. It was arranged for coaches to collect and bring in the old people from the far ends of the Borough. Some delay was traffic congestion in the S.E.1. area, and the coach arrived after the beginning of the Concert, In spite of this, everyone enjoyed the evening including the cup of tea and the cake during the interval. 52 King George VI Memorial Club (Camberwell and Lambeth) The total number of attendances during the year ending 31st March, 1965 was 11,866, an increase of 101. The membership of the Club during the year was 454 (402 women, 52 men). There were 199 referrals during the year and 137 names were taken off the Register for various reasons. This year as many members as possible were encouraged to have a holiday and 114 members availed themselves of holidays through schemes organised by the Borough Council, Old People's Welfare Association, and London County Council with assistance from various organisations. The members chose Herne Bay for their seaside outings this year and this proved to be a pleasant change. Friends in the country invited members each club day in July, and in September, a coach tour around Kent was arranged for each day. The Monday Club won the Handicraft Competition for the second year in succession, and an exhibition and Sale of Work was held at the end of November The greatly appreciated services rendered by the Club, i.e. bathing, chiropdy hairdressing, personal shopping, sale of welfare foods at specially reduces prices and many other such services, have maintained their high standard. Half Day Summer Outings Outings for older, more infirm persons not belonging to Clubs, were arranged once again by the Association. The number of outings during the Summer was increased to seven and over 210 people enjoyed these trips. At the end of March the B.C.C. organised a visit to their theatre at the Ideal Home Exhibition, Olympia for old people from various centres and 38 members who took part in the Inter-Club Talent Competition and some voluntary helpers from the Lunch Clubs attended.. A tour of the Exhibition followed. The Christchurch Youth Club organised a trip to the Scala Theatre in May, and the Kennington Toc H arranged trip to Chessington Zoo in July. Holi day s Holidays were organised for 465 old people at Margate and 18 old people were sent away under the Infirm Holiday Scheme. A total of 53 saved with the Association for two weeks holiday with the Women's Holiday Fund. Also, eleven went away at Christmas. Holidays play a very large part in the lives of old people. A week by the sea is something to look forward to, and something to look back on during the winter months when so many are confined to their own homes. 53 Day Care Service This service has now been running for just over a year, and has proved of great to many old people within the Borough. The task of the "Good Neighbour" is the kind of service often given by a devoted daughter living near by; and includes fire lighting and the early morning cup of tea, shopping, cooking a light meal, and when necessary, the check at night ensures that all is well. A small payment is made to the Good Neighbour which ensures that the help is given regularly and permanently. A special effort is being made to attract newly retired women. Another service provided is that of "sitters-in". This kind of help can prevent breakdown in relatives caring for the aged. It enables them to have an evening out free from worry. HOSPITALS Lambeth is within the catchment area of two hospital groups, the Lambeth and Camberwell Groups. These in turn are administered by two different Regional Hospital Boards, the South West Metropolitan and South East Metropolitan respectively. The areas served by the two hospital groups extend beyond the Borough boundaries. The Lambeth group has premises outside the Borough whilst the Camberwell Group has none in it. In addition to hospitals within the normal hospital framework of the National Health Service there are two teaching hospitals in the Borough, King's College Hospital and St. Thomas's Hospital each with its own board of Governors. The following is a list of hospitals within the Borough Lambeth Hospital Group (S.W. Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board) Lambeth Hospital, Brook Drive, S.E.11.

PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES It is the duty of the Local Health Authority, in the case of the Borough of Lambeth, the London County Council, either to provide these services or arrange for their provision by some other organisation. The County Council does in fact administer the maternity and child welfare services, the vaccination and immunisation, health visiting and domestic help services from the Divisional Health Offices, 2, Walworth Road, S.E.1. Vaccination and immunisation is also done by general practitioners. The midwifery, ambulance and mental health services are administered direct from the Public Health Department, County Hall, S.E.1, and home nursing is carried out on behalf of the County Council by voluntary organisations. The voluntary nursing associations working in the Borough are as follows Brixton District Nursing Association Camberwell District Nursing Association Norwood and District Nursing Association Ranyard Nurses Roman Catholic Nurses' Institute South London District Nursing Association Southwark, Newington and Walworth District Nursing Associations . PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICE The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a comprehensive service for the examination of specimens submitted by local authorities and general practingtioners. The local Laboratory is situated at County Hall and is under the direction of Dr. A.J.H. Tomlinson. 55 SECTION D SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply I am indebted to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board for the following report on the water supplied to the Borough. The supply to the Borough of Lambeth has been satisfactory both for quality quantity during 1964. The source of water supply is mainly River Thames derived water with a small admixture of water from Honor Oak and Merton wells in the summer months. There were no new sources of supply instituted by the Board in the area during the year, but new trunk mains were laid in Lambeth to the extent of 1,042 yards. There were no changes in the general scheme of supply in the Borough but lengths of small service mains were laid to the extent of 2,427 yards. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being brought into or restored to, service, and samples of the water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure that its quality is up to that normally supplied. The number of samples taken during the year was as follows Chemical Examination Bacteriological Examination Thames Derived 371 3,811 Honor Oak Well 1 213 Merton Well Not in supply Not in supply 372 4,024 The average results are contained in the following tables. 56 Average Results of Chemical Examination Milligrammes per litre (unless otherwise stated) Description of the Sample No. of Samples Ammoniacal Nitrogen Albuminoid Nitrogen Nitrate Nitrogen Chlorides as CI.

The water from two wells is used for drinking purposes, or for the preparation of food. Reports of the analyses of water, from these wells are received regularly and have been satisfactory for the year under review. Sewers I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for supplying me with the following information with regard to sewers within the Borough. A sum of £32,000 was provided in the estimates for the reconstruction of defctive sewers in Hubert Grove, Southey Road, Baylis Road and Crown Lane and for the construction of new manholes on sewers with inadequate means of access. 58 The local sewers which are approximately 150 miles in length are maintained by the Borough Council and the main sewers, into which the local sewers eventually discharge, are maintained by the London County Council. The routine cleansing and flushing of the local sewers and gulley maintenance is carried out by the Council's direct labour force.

The usual offenders were wood boring beetles, ants, cockroaches, drugstore beetles, carpet beetles, clothes moths, weevils ans silver fish. The total number of visits made by the staff of the Disinfecting Station for all purposes was 1,797. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT 1949 Rat destruction in dwelling houses and business premises is carried out under the direction of the Rodent Officer, and two Rodent operatives working under his supervision. Sewer treatment is carried out by the department of the Borough Engineer in conjunction with the Rodent Officer and his staff.

As a result of this, notices under sections 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Housing Act 1961were served on the owners as follows:- Section 15 Section 14 Section 16 Section 19 120 2 20 102 In addition, 10 Orders applying Management Regulations have been made and 1 Control Order under section 73 of the Housing Act 1964. 1,700 inspections have been made in connection with surveys, complaints and London Country Council mortgage loans, and 1,855 re-visits made. 70 The works required under sections 15 and 16 have been completed or were being carried out by the owners of 48 properties. Thirty-four cases were reported to the Public Health Committee for work to be carried out in default, but only'12 of these will be carried out by the Council. In the remaining cases the owners have decided to carry out the work themselves. The owners of 22 properties were persuaded to carry out necessary works without formal action being taken by the Council. Three Notices under section 15 were revoked, the number of occupants being reduced, so making the works required in the notices unnecessary. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CLEAN AIR ACT 1956 Smoke Control Areas Smoke Control Areas now established in the Borough are as follows:- (a) Areas operative prior to 31st December, 1964 Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 Acreage covered 949.31 (b) Area not yet confirmed No. 12 80.06 Total 1029.37 Progress was somewhat delayed by a Public Enquiry held on the 9th November, 1964, consequent upon an objection to No. 12, Smoke Control Order. The Housing Act 1964, in section 95, in addition to clarifying certain minor points gave authority to the Council to pay grants in circumstances previously excluded from the Clean Air Act. These changes are set out in Circular 46/64 dated 14th August, 1964. Circular 60/64 dated 18th December, 1964, prohibits the payment of grants on conversions to heating appliances which use "peak-load" electrical current. Experience indicates that this prohibition will cause very little hardship in future Smoke Control Areas. A number of warning letters regarding contraventions of Smoke Control Orders were sent to individuals, but in no case was recourse to legal proceedings necessary. 71 Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution Daily measurement of smoke stain densities and sulphur dioxide concent- rations have been maintained in the Boroughs five measuring stations, in callabo- ration with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The following figures show the number of visits and revisits made by the Smoke Inspectors and the Technical Assistants during the year :- Visits Revisits 305 - Timed Observations 699 - Untimed Observations Other visits, private and industrial premises 15,626 3,932 868 Statutory Notices were served under section 12(2) of the Act. 72 SECTION E INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES The year 1964 was unusual as far as food inspection was concerned for two reasons; one the Aberdeen typhoid fever outbreak (reported in detail elsewhere) and an unusually fine summer. Both events had a bearing on the work of the food section and required increased effort in certain directions while routine matters were not attended to during certain periods because of additional duties requiring priority. Undoubtedly the Aberdeen outbreak made people 'complaint conscious' which resulted in an increase of 50 per cent of justified complaints. There was a marked temporary increase in complaints of mouldy bread and rolls due to the fine weather and this was experienced in many areas other than Lambeth. The cold store at Nine Elms requires the constant attention of the Food Inspectors. The following Regulations and Orders, relating to food, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of the Council were made during the year :- Regulation or Order Operative date The Dried Milk Regulations 1964 11th March, 1965 The Mineral Hydro carbons in Food 15th August, 1964 Regulations, 1964 The Soft Drink Regulations, 1964 Regns. 1 and 18(1) 2nd June, 1964 Remainder 2nd June, 1965 The Meat Treatment Regulations 1964 23rd January, 1964 Food Premises During the year under review 2,387 inspections were made to food premises in the Borough. These inspections and revisits were made up as follows 73  Inspections Revisits 348 47 Food Factories 28 - Bakehouses 635 - Butchers 36 - Fried Fish Shops 61 - Ice Cream Premises 194 - Milk Shops 16 - Public Houses 150 2 Restaurants 55 - Dairies 864 15 Other 2,387 64 The approximate number of food premises by type of business in the area is as follows :- Grocery and provisions 363 Greengrocery and fruit 165 Fish shops, wet dry and fried 98 Bakers 94 Butchers 142 Restaurants 202 Confectioners 279 food and Drugs Act 1955 - Section 16 The number of registered premises is as follows Manufacture and/or sale of ice cream 626 Manufacture of sausages and preparation of preserved etc. food 294 Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 - Regulations Number of registered distributors 295 Number of registered dairies 2 (Special Designation) Regulations 1963 The following table shows the number of licences m force :- * Dealers' Licences (Pre-packed) Tuberculin Tested 169 Pasteurised 257 Sterilised 265 14 Dealers' (Pasteuriser's) Licence 2 Dealers' (Tuberculin Tested) Licence 2 * Licences issued are valid for a period of 5 years. Under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1963 there are three designations of milk "Untreated", "Pasteurised" and "Sterilised". On and from 1st October, 1964 the special designation "Untreated" for raw milk replaced the designation "Tuberculin Tested" although until 31st December, 1964 the labelling of "Untreated" milk with the words "Tuberculin Tested" was optional. Similarly during the same period it was permissable to sell "Pasteurised Milk" under the alternative description "Tuberculin Tested Milk (Pasteurised)"- Some difference of opinion on the interpretation of the labelling requirements in respect of Pasteurised Milk in bottles has arisen. It is hoped that the matter will be resolved otherwise it may have to be tested in the Courts. SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS Chemical Analysis Two hundred and thirty eight samples were procured formally, 158 of which were of milk, and 1,262 samples were procured informally.

Bacteriological and other Examinations The following samples were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination. Articles marked with an asterisk were suspected of having caused food poisoning, but in none of these cases was the food poisoning organism isolated. Ice cream and Ice cream Mix 16 Ice lolly 1 Corned Beef 1 Corned Beef loaf 1 Cheese 1 Fluid from Cheese 1 *Sausages 1 *Bacon 1 Gripe water 2 79 Of the 16 samples of ice cream examined and submitted to the Methylene Blue Test, 4 fell into grades 3 and 4 representing 25% of the total. All samples falling below grades 1 and 2 were repeated after calling the attention of the manufacturers to the results and giving advice where necessary. Follow up samples were reported as satisfactory. Samples of milk were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations as follows Methylene Blue Test 194 (24 were' void, the atmospheric shade temperature being over 65°F.). four failed to satisfy the prescribed test. Phosphatase Tests 190. All passed the test. Of the 4 samples of milk which failed the Methylene Blue Test two were of of raw Tuberculin Tested Channel Islands milk bottled on the farm. The other two failures were of milk pasteurised in the borough. The failures have been reported to the Divisional Milk Officer and to the pasteuriser as appropriate. Labelling of Food The Food Standards Committee, set up to advise the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and other appropriate Ministers has published a comprehenssive report on the labelling of food and this is under consideration by the minister and interested bodies with a view to introducing the necessary legislation. INSPECTION OF FOOD During the first four months of the year consignments of pigs slaughtered in a rural district were delivered to a meat factory in the borough without having been inspected at the place of slaughter. This was due to the inability of the Council concenned to recruit qualified inspectorial staff during the period. Staffing deficiencies have since been rectified. By arrangements with the Chief Public Health Inspector of this district, the Council's two Food Inspectors carried out inspections on delivery to the factory, Advantage was taken to give public health inspector students additional training in this aspect of Public Health Inspectors duties. 2,108 pigs were inspected, 115 parts of pigs were found to be diseased and were destroyed. Total weight destroyed was 16 cwts., 3 qtrs., 25 lbs. 80 Following information received from the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health about cans of corned beef and ox tongues processed at establishments in South America, one of which was suspected of having a connection with an outbreak of typhoid fever in Aberdeen, all food shops, feeding establishments, food factories and warehouses in the borough were immediately notified and requested to isolate and hold all cans of these meats pending inspection by a Public Health Inspector and subsequent disposal instructions. All such cans of meat were inspected. Meat from cans which had been opened or were "blown" was destroyed. The remainder, fifty in all, were returned to the suppliers. Three suppliers with warehouses in the borough received from various retailers, caterers, institutions etc. a total of 3,637 cans of corned beef and 170 cans of ox tongues processed at one or other of the suspect establishments. Two suppliers transferred 3,621 cans of corned beef and 170 cans of ox tongues to premises outside the borough and the Public Health Departments of the appropriate districts were notified. No official instructions have so far been received regarding disposal of these suspect cans. Inspection at Shops, Stores, Factories and Wharf Large quantities of food of all varieties were inspected and as a result the following food was surrendered as unfit for human consumption and unsound Certificates were issued.

As an additional precaution unfit meat is stained. Some food waste which was suitable was diverted to approved sources for utilisation as pig food. The balance was destroyed by incineration in accordance with arrangements entered into with Camberwell Borough Council. FOOD COMPLAINTS - 1964 1. Loaf Contained parts of insect 2. Bread Dirty 3.

Loaf Contained tobacco Justified complaints 91 Total number of complaints 110 85 There has been a 60% reduction in the number of dirty milk bottle complaints compared with those reported in 1963. There appears to be two main reasons for this, one a determined effort by one large bottling plant in the Borough to improve the efficency of the human element both as regards scrubbing of washed bottles and the maintenance of the bottle washing machines at maximum performance, and two, a possible reduction in the number of deliveries of milk from one large bottling plant to distributors in the Borough. It is not known, and there is no way of ascertaining, whether as a result of the alteration in distribution increased complaints have been received by other boroughs. All complaints were investigated, the main object of which was to discover the cause and take necessary steps to prevent recurrances. Advice was given where appropriate. Some of these foods were prepared outside the Borough, and a few overseas. in such cases the Medical Officer of Health of the district concerned, or where appropriate, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, was informed. Imported Food Regulations, 1937-1948 Proposals initiated by the Corporation of London in 1962, to transfer to the Port of London Health Authority the Council's functions, in common with other London riparian authorities, in respect of imported food have been the subject of consideration and investigation by the Minister of Health. The Minister, in November, 1964 decided that the circumstances were not such as to warrant removing from the riparian authorities the powers they have held under regulations with regard to imported food. Inspections, disposal, and, where necessary detention, sampling and chemical analysis or bacteriological examination of food landed in the borough continue therefore to be the responsibility of the Council and its designated officers, the Medical Officer of Health and the two Food Inspectors. The newly built London Cold Storage Co's premises at 32, Wandsworth Road which has a capacity of 16,000 tons began operating as a cold store in August of this year. There are facilities for receiving imported food by barge from the London Docks as well as by road and rail. 216 samples of imported food have been taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service for examination for the presence of food poisoning organisms and any indicationjof undersirable bacterial contamination. 86 Type of Food No. of samples Origin Report Horsemeat (ex. Hindquarters, Forequarters, 33 Argentina Various groups of salmonella Hearts, Tongues, Livers and Kidneys) 8 Paraquay organisms isolated. The consignments from which the above samples were taken were dealt with in accordance with an agreed standard i.e. released unconditionally or released on receipt of sterilisation guarantees. Organisms of the salmonella group were not isolated from 128 samples of horse meat etc., and the consignments were released unconditionally. Type of Food No. of samples Origin Report Prawns 24 Japan Satisfactory 99 6 China 99 99 12 Australia 99 Crab legs, meat and claws 5 Alaska 99 In addition, 575 cartons of Canadian beef lungs and 710 bags of Argentine beef lungs were imported for human consumption. These were released without examination on receipt of guarantees that the whole of the consignments would be sterilised. Street Markets Markets are held in The Cut, Lower Marsh, Lambeth Walk and Wilcox Road in the Inner Wards and in Popes Road, Electric Avenue and Brixton Station Road. All these are inspected regularly. Slaughter of Animals Act No application was made during the year for the issue of a licence under the provisions of this Act. 87 SECTION F GENERAL public Swimming Baths I am indebted to the Scientific Adviser of the London County Council for the following reports or the results of Bacteriological Examinations from Kennington Park and Brockwell Park Swimming Baths. 1964 No. of samples Agar count 1 ml. 37°C. 24 hrs. Presumptive coli without faecal Faecal coli 0-10 11-100 Over 100 Brockwell Summer 12 11 1 Winter 8 3 2 1 2 Kennington Summer 14 14 Winter 6 4 1 1 The following comments apply to the incidence of coliform pollution Winter 1964 - On 21st January, at Kennington Park, and on 27th October, at Brockwell Park, there was evidence of coliform pollution. This was due to low chlorine residuals and was speedily remedied. During the winter chemical dosing is by hand. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 section 50 - Burials Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1948 the Lambeth Borough council is required to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in its area if in such cases it appears to the Council no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body has been or are being made. 88 During the year 19 funerals were arranged involving 14 males and five females. The amount paid to funeral contractors was £234.18s.6d. The sum of £176.10s.0d. was recovered by way of grants, insurance policies and money found. The actual cost to the Council was therefore £58.8s.6d. LAND CHARGES ACT 1925 During the year 3,509 enquiries were received and dealt with in respect of searches under the above mentioned Act. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT 1933 The number of persons entered or retained on the list under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933 (Section 21) Part II was 147. RAG BLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT 1951 Twenty eight samples of various filling materials were submitted to a prescribed Analyst for examination. All the samples complied with the test under the Regulations for 1951. PET ANIMALS ACT 1951 This Act provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. A local authority may, on application, grant to a person who is not for the time being disqualified from keeping a pet shop a licence to keep a pet shop at such premises in their area as may be specified in the application, and subject to compliance with such conditions as may be specified in the licence. In determining whether to grant a licence for the keeping of a pet shop, a local authority shall in particular have regard to the need for securing (a) That animals will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable respecting size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness; (b) that animals will be adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals. (c) that animals, being mammals, will not be sold at too early an age; 89 (d) that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious diseases; (e) that appropriate steps will be taken in case of fire or other emergency. During the year 10 licences were issued under the Act. No. of Inspections - 13 No. of re-visits - - LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT 1954 Hairdressers and Barbers On the 6th July, 1955 the Lambeth Borough Council made bye-laws in tespect of hairdressers and barbers under the above mentioned Act.
