(By Order) FREDERICK AVE LING, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Harrow Road; 12th July, 1862. SANITARY REPORT for the year 1861-62. by J. BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., M.R.C.P. Medical Officer of Health, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Consumption, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at St. Mary's Hospital, And formerly Physician to the Western General Dispensary. REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall, July, 1862. Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit to you the usual Annual Summary of the proceedings of the Sanitary Committee during the year ending Lady-day, 1862. The orders which have been made during the year for the improvement of dwellings and the removal of nuisances, have been in every instance eventually carried out. As in former years, the requirements of the Committee have been usually readily complied with by the owners of property, and in addition a large amount of sanitary work has been done spontaneously, shewing that the advantages of maintaining the dwellings of the poor in a wholesome and cleanly condition are becoming more and more appreciated. 12 In three instances the orders of the Committee for the construction of new Drains were for a time disregarded. In one of these cases, the neglect gave rise to serious consequences; the existing Drain which was defective and inefficient, became completely obstructed, and several of the adjoining premises were in consequence flooded with sewage. As the health of the inhabitants of these houses appeared to be seriously endangered, the Surveyor was authorized to take such immediate measures as were urgently required, at the expense of the Vestry, and the matter was placed in the hands of the Vestry Solicitor, with instructions to take proceedings under the 73rd Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act. In the second case proceedings of a similar nature were also commenced, but the owner eventually complied with the requirements of the Vestry. In the third instance, the period allowed by the Act for the completion of the works having expired, the Vestry judged it expedient to proceed to the final alternative of carrying out their Order themselves at the owner's expense. The officers of the Vestry have been instructed on three occasions during the year, to make complaint at the Police Court, Marylebone, of nuisances injurious to health. In the beginning of May, the Occupiers of several Cowhouses in Jonson's Mews 13 were summoned in respect of the unwholesome condition of their premises. In June, proceedings were taken against a Dust Contractor and Scavenger, in Irongate Wharf, on account of the unreasonable quantity of foul and offensive matter which he had allowed to accumulate in his yard, and in September against the Owner of the Mint Stables, South Wharf Road, for permitting those premises, which are in part occupied as dwellings, to be in such a state as to be injurious to health. In each instance, the evils complained of were of an urgent nature. The parties liable were required to abate the nuisance, and orders were made by the magistrate prohibiting the repetition of the offence. At Mint Stables several cases of fever, one of which was fatal, had occurred among the poor families occupying the rooms above the Stables, and while the enquiry was pending, a man who surreptitiously inhabited one of the Stables died under such circumstances as to render an inquest necessary. Although the examination of the body, shewed that his death could not have been influenced by sanitary defects, the foul condition of the Stables became the subject of animadversion. The Drainage has since been reconstructed by the owner at great expense, and other necessary works of improvement have been carried out. 14 The Canal Basin. On the 29th of November I had an interview with the Chairman and Secretary of the Grand Junction Canal Company on the subject of the Canal Basin and the various nuisances connected with it, particularly the contamination of the water arising from the falling of various substances between the barges and the wharf in the process of loading. I specially called the attention of these gentlemen to the fact that in consequence of the carelessness of the labourers employed on the manure wharves in the occupation of the Company, a large quantity of manure daily and hourly finds its way into the basin, and is drifted during the prevalence of westerly winds, to the east end. There it becomes gradually soaked with water and sinks to the bottom so as to form a putrescible deposit. When the basin was emptied on the 6th of July last, a deposit consisting entirely of driftings from the manure wharves was found to extend for a distance of about 20 yards from the east end, and varying in thickness from a foot to 16 inches. In this way although the evil is committed throughout the year, its consequences only become appreciable when called into existence by the heats of summer. My interview also related to the inefficiency of the weir at the east end of the basin, which was 15 constructed in 1861, at the request of the Sanitary Committee. It was pointed out that the purpose for which it was intended, was to ensure a continuous stream through the basin, but that owing to the absence of a proper relation between the levels of the two weirs at the inlet and outlet respectively, the whole of the available current continued to flow over the weir near the inlet without entering the basin at all. It was at once agreed that the weir in question should be heightened. Disinfection. On the 18th of July, 1861, I was instructed to report on the best means of disinfecting Stables. Various substances have been proposed for the purpose, some having for their object merely the destruction of offensive smell, others being adapted to destroy or decompose the putrescent organic matter which is the cause of that smell, such for example as Chloride of Lime, and a variety of metallic salts, (Nitrate of Lead, Perchloride of Iron, Chloride of Zinc, &c.) All of these disinfectants have the disadvantage that when applied to manure they injure its fertilizing properties, besides which drawback most of them must be added in the liquid state, which renders their use inconvenient in Stables. For these reasons the preference may be given without hesitation to another class of 16 disinfectants which act not by decomposing the pntrescible matter, but simply by arresting putrefaction. Of these anti-septic substances, Creasote and Carbolic Acid are unquestionably the best; the latter having the additional advantage of cheapness, is on this ground most to be recommended. During the last few years it has been largely used in this country, in France and in Germany, and its claims have been submitted to repeated scientific investigation. In July and August complaints were received in great numbers of the offensive emanations from gully grates, on which account it was thought necessary to resume the disinfecting operations in use in the year 1859. A small sum was employed for the purpose, those localities being selected for the purpose in which complaint had for the most part arisen, and in which the condition of the Sewers admitted of their being advantageously operated on. For the disinfection of Sewers, crude Carbolic acid is used in the liquid state along with an excess of milk of lime; it has the great advantage over Chloride of Lime that it is beneficial to the health of the workmen employed in the Sewers, whereas when the chloride is used the air of the Sewers cannot be respired without producing irritation of the bronchial tubes. 17 Slaughter-houses. On the 3rd of October, a list of persons who had given notice of their intention to occupy certain premises as slaughter-houses was submitted to the Sanitary Committee. It having appeared that the premises No. 129 Praed Street, were unfit for the purpose, on the grounds stated in the Report presented thereon, the Committee recommended the Vestry to shew cause against the grant of a licence. This recommendation was agreed to by the Vestry at their next meeting, and it was resolved that the licensing Magistrate should be furnished with a copy of the Medical Officer's Report, stating the grounds of objection. The licence was accordingly refused. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. B. SANDERSON. c 18 TABLE SHEWING THE PRINCIPAL STREETS AND PLACES IN WHICH WORKS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED UNDER ORDERS ISSUED DURING THE YEARS 1856 TO 1861.

Vestry Hall, Paddington; June, 1862. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of the 196th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act,” I have the honor to submit my Sixth Annual Report of the Works executed in the Sewers Department from the 25th of March, 1861, to the 25th of March, 1862, inclusive. During the past year forty-four Notices have been received for the erection of 144 New Buildings, viz.:—one Synagogue, 132 Houses and eleven Stables, in compliance with the requirements of the 76th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act”; and thirty-four applications have been made and granted, for the re-construction of Drains under the public footpaths and roadways to forty Houses and Premises. These were rendered necessary in consequence of Notices issued by the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, or were executed at the suggestion of the Owners of the respective Buildings. 28 In every case where Cesspools and common Privies previously existed, they have been destroyed and Water Closets substituted.

In Sussex Square and Sussex Gardens, two Side Entrances to Sewers have been made; 166 Gully Drains have been constructed in different parts of the Parish for the purpose of carrying off the surface water, and 122 repaired. Total length of Brick Sewer constructed, 3227 feet run. Total length of Drain Pipe laid down, 11,088 feet run. The value of these works I estimate at £4000. The Sewerage Works constructed by William Crockett, Contractor, in Sussex Square, Sussex Gardens, Westbourne Street, Westbourne Crescent, Westbourne Terrace, Connaught Square, Berkeley Street, Lower Porchester Street, Stanhope Place and Norfolk Crescent, are part of the improvements suggested in my Report of the 12th May, 1858, on the condition of the old Sewers in Paddington. After the completion of the contract, I passed through 30 the Sewers in question, and found them in excellent working order. Six Head-walls where foul gases accumulated have been destroyed, and there is now a strong current of air passing through the whole of the Sewers in this locality. The flow of the Sewage is also considerably improved by the addition of new glazed stoneware inverts to the bottom of the old Sewers. About two miles of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from two to nine inches in depth, have been thoroughly cleansed, the hard deposit which could not be removed by flushing was raised to the surface and carried away in carts. Eleven hundred and eighty-four Gully Drains and Sand Pits have also been cleansed. Jobbing Works, comprising 323 separate and distinct works, such as the repair of Sewers and Gullies, fixing Traps and other works connected therewith, have been executed by the Contractor to the Vestry, to the value of £1475 : 10 : 10. This amount includes the sum of £361 : 14 : 1 received from Owners of Property for fixing Traps at outlets of existing Drains, constructing Gullies, and laying Drain Pipes under thoroughfares taken to by the Parish. In addition to the foregoing details, I beg to state that 169 complaints on subjects connected with the Sewers Department have been received; 31 they had reference to stoppages in Sewers, Gullies, Drains, &c. With respect to stoppages in Drains leading into Brick Sewers, they have either been removed from the inside of the Sewer, or the complainant has been informed of the exact spot where the stoppage has occurred; and thus expense and annoyance in stripping the Drain has been obviated. This information is furnished free of expense to every Rate-payer. It has been my uniform practice to give immediate attention to such matters; and I have succeeded either in removing the cause of complaint, or have been enabled to suggest a remedy for the evils brought under my consideration. I believe that all the information which it is in my power to furnish has now been condensed into this Report, which I venture most respectfully to submit to your indulgent attention. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM MERRY, surveyor. To The Vestry of Paddington. 1862.

[No. 5. REPORT ON THE HEALTH OF PADDINGTON DURING THE QUARTER ENDING MICHAELMAS, 1861, BY J. BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. Population of Paddington, April, 1861 75,807. Vestry Hall; December, 1861. During the three months ending September 29th, 344 persons died in Paddington. The mortality was less by 12 than that of the previous quarter, and less by 91 than that of the first quarter of the year. It however considerably exceeded the mortality of the corresponding quarter of 1860. On analysing the returns according to the ages of the persons dying, it is found that this excess is almost entirely referable to the increased number of deaths of children under five. This fact adds another to the many illustrations which these Reports have already afforded of the truth, that the mortality of infants is a much more sensitive index of the general health, than that of persons in the more advanced periods of life. Forty-four out of the 51 deaths by which the present return exceeded that of last year, are recorded under the heads of whooping cough, diarrhoea, or the nervous and respiratory diseases of infants. No epidemic has been prevalent; small-pox is for the present erased from our list of fatal disorders. Public Vaccination.—Since the date of my last Report an important measure, relating to public vaccination, has received the sanction of the Legislature. It has for its object to facilitate proceedings before Justices for the purpose of enforcing obedience to the previously existing Acts. Its most important provision relates to the reimbursement to public officers of the expenses incurred by them in all such proceedings, and of costs in those cases in which no conviction is obtained. Any person specially appointed for the purpose by a Board of Guardians, any Registrar of Births and Deaths, or Medical Officer of Health, is entitled to his expenses, which are made payable out of the Poor Rates. Up to the present time the compulsory clauses of the Vaccination Act of 1853 have been for the most past a dead letter; the recent Act renders them more or less operative. But the mere exercise of compulsory power is not by any means the most important instrumentality in securing that general prevalence of the practice of vaccination among the people which is necessary to render it an effectual barrier against the invasion of small-pox. In this country vaccination can never become universal, unless it is accepted by the people with confidence; and this confidence can only be founded on the assurance that it is performed in the best possible manner, and above all with the most vigilant caution that the purest vaccine lymph only is employed. For the most serious obstacle with which vaccination has to contend, both in town and country districts, consists in the popular apprehension that the lymph may under certain circumstances be the means of imparting, not merely the vaccine disease and the desired immunity from small-pox which is its consequence, but some other infection or vice of constitution which may injuriously affect the whole after-life of the person vaccinated. One constantly meets with children of whom it is stated, that although in good health until vaccination, they have never been well since; that 2 a cutaneous eruption, or some other symptom of disease, appeared after the operation, which left them weak and ailing. The prevalence of these and other similar notions, is familiar to every one who has frequent intercourse with the poor, whether in urban or rural districts; it is to be explained by the fact that the external manifestations of constitutional unhealthiness naturally begin to appear shortly after that period of life at which vaccination is often performed. Whatever may be its origin, a prejudice which is so generally diffused, can scarcely be met by coercion; for to compel a parent to allow that to be done to his child which he sincerely believes will communicate a life-long disease, or permanently injure his health, is at best an obligation from which one would rather escape : it may to a certain extent be combated by the diffusion of information of such a nature as to show that the belief is a delusion, but much more effectually by the adoption of precautions to prevent the possibility of those mischances which occasionally occur in vaccination, and afford to the popular mind a pretext for distrust. In the accomplishment of these objects the public has as much concern as the medical profession. No less than 458,000 persons are annually vaccinated at the public expense; it is therefore a matter of national interest that this boon—the greatest that medical science has ever conferred on suffering humanity, should not be depreciated through the negligence or indifference of its administrators. The common notion that no two infections can reign together in the living organism is generally true. The vaccine virus, if employed in that stage of its development at which it is most active, is incapable under any circumstances of communicating any other infection, except that of cow-pox. If on the other hand it is mixed with other morbid products, or taken at so late a period that it has lost its special virulence, it may possibly, while failing to produce its own genuine effects, be the means of conveying other maladies. The other day a hand-bill, bearing the title, "Terrible effects of Vaccination," and embodying the popular fallacies to which I have been referring, was largely distributed in Paddington. It related the particulars of a calamitous occurrence recently recorded in a remote village in Italy; where a repulsive constitutional disease was alleged to have been communicated to forty-six children out of sixty-three, vaccinated with lymph derived from the same source. Of these children several died. The vaccine lymph employed was contaminated, and had acquired a virulence not that of cow-pox, but of another disease, with which the whole organism of the child from whom it was taken, was impregnated. Such a disaster, although liable to be taken advantage of by those who trade on popular ignorance, does not afford the slightest ground for distrust of vaccination, as performed in this country. Admitting as we do, that much spurious and consequently useless vaccination exists, there is no shadow of ground for apprehending that the terrible tragedy enacted at Rivolta, can ever be repeated in England ; for it may be safely said that no practitioner, however careless, ever performs the operation in the manner which was there employed. In the immense experience of this country no instance has yet occurred in which disease, other than cowpox, has been transmitted by vaccination. A few years ago a most searching investigation was made under the sanction of Government, in which the question was submitted to almost every medical practitioner of experience throughout the kingdom, many being included in the enquiry who had vaccinated from 10,000 to 60,000 children. No single instance of transmission had been met with. Those minor consequences already referred to, which so often excite apprehensions in the minds of parents, ought in the opinion of all practical men, never to occur; being the results of the improper performance of the operation, they are perfectly avoidable. "They constitute therefore a reason for care in the performance of vaccination, but no objection whatever to the operation itself."* On the other hand, the story of Rivolta is of value, a» shewing that the precautions adopted in this country are not useless, and cannot be neglected without danger, and that those efforts which have been recently made to extend such precautions, and introduce more improved methods, have been well directed. Since the management of public vaccination was placed in the handa of the * Dr. Seatom on the protective and modifying power of Vaccination. 3 Privy Council, their Lordships have taken measures to ensure that no one shall be permitted to exercise the functions of public vaccinator without competent skill, acquired by actual practice of the operation, and have provided educational stations, for the purpose. In addition to this, they have embodied in their instructions, which are now binding on all vaccinators under contract, those precautions which the largest experience has found to be useful, and have recommended to the administrators of poor law relief throughout the country, the adoption of such arrangements as are calculated to enable the vaccinator to adopt the best methods, and above all, to employ only recent and liquid lymph, derived from the most carefully selected sources. It is a well established fact, that wherever vaccination is well performed, prejudice disappears, and the operation becomes universal while in those localities in which the necessary precautions are neglected, it as certainly becomes unpopular, and can only be maintained by compulsion. Whence it may be anticipated that by further improvements, the protection of the population from small-pox may be rendered no less complete in England than it already is in Sweden and Prussia, without having recourse to the arbitrary enactments, by which the object is attained in those countries.
