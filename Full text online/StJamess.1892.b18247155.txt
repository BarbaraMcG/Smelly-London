Report upon Articles Analysed during year 1892 33 5 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of the VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, for the year 1892. The figures given by the Census of 1891 showed that since the Census of 1881, the resident population in St. James's had fallen from 29,941 to 24,993—a reduction of nearly 5,000, i.e., one-sixth of the entire resident population of St. James's had disappeared during the Decennium 1881-1891. The District of the Parish of St. James's covers an area of 162 acres, and, taking the population at 24,993, it would contain 154 22 persons per acre against 184 per acre in 1881. The mean density of the population in Registration London, by the Census of 1891, was 56.5 persons per acre. 6 The following table shows the certified causes of the deaths of persons reported as belonging to St. James's, but as dying, during the year 1892, in outlying institutions Abdominal Section 1 Apoplexy 1 Ascites 1 Brain Disease 3 Bronchitis 9 Cancer 11 Cæsarean Section 1 Congenital Debility 1 Cystitis 1 Diabetes 1 Diphtheria 7 Gangrene 1 Gastro-Enteritis 1 Heart Disease 8 Intus-susception 1 Kidney Disease 2 Liver Disease 5 Measles (disease contracted in Westminster Hospital) 1 Meningitis 2 Paralysis 5 Phthisis 21 Pneumonia 10 Scarlet Fever 5 (In one of these cases the Scarlet Fever was reported to have been contracted in the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street; in another case the disease was contracted in the Throat Hospital, Golden Square.) Carried forward 99 7 Brought forward 99 Sclerosis .. 1 Spina Bifida 1 Spleen Disease 1 Violent Deaths:— Burns 2 Drowned 1 Fractured Skull 1 Fractured Ribs 1 Run Over 1 Suicide while Drunk (Opium Poisoning) 1 — 7 109 Against the above deaths, as affecting the true mortality of St. James's, should be set the deaths of strangers who die in hotels and lodging-houses—many of whom have come to London for medical advice and treatment. A very large number of such hotels and lodging-houses exist in St. James's, but the precise number of the deaths among such visitors is not known. Such deaths, occurring in the district as are known not to belong to St. James's, are brought into account below. The net mortality of the Parish of St. James's (including the foregoing deaths in outlying institutions) for the year 1892, was 446. In a population of 24,993. 446 deaths amount to a death-rate of 17.83 per 1,000, The death-rate of Registration London, for the year 1892, was 20 6 per 1,000. 8 The following numbers of deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1892:— First Quarter 147 Second Quarter 83 Third Quarter 67 Fourth Quarter 87 384 Deaths in St. James's during the year 1892 384 Deaths in outlying institutions among persons reported as belonging to St. James's 109 493 Deduct deaths of persons known as Non-Parishioners:— Dying in the Union-House 36 Dying in the Throat Hospital 8 Dying elsewhere 3 47 Net Mortality of St. James's for the year 1892 446 Of the notifiable infectious diseases 136 cases came under notice during the year. Of these 136 cases, 66 were Scarlet Fever, 13 were Typhoid , 27 were Diphtheria, 22 were Erysipelas, 2 were Croup, 3 Small Pox, 1 Infantile Cholera, 1 Continued Fever, and 1 Puerperal Fever. Of these 136 9 cases, 92 were removed to Extra-Parochial Hospitals, and 2 to the Union House in Poland Street; 42 of the 136 cases were not removed. During the year 1892, 41 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. Thirty-four inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 31 post-mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room adjoining the Mortuary. 10 Table showing the Names and numbers of Zymotic and certain other deaths which occurred in St. James's in each Quarter of the Year 1892.

REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1892, MADE TO THE Vestry of St. James, Westminster, by JAS. EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P., Loud , F.R.M.S., F.C.S., &.c., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen — During the year 1892, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 60 samples were examined, all which were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. In none of the samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. It will be seen that Sample No. 6 was a Butter containing 75 per cent. of foreign fat. The vendor was prosecuted, but the summons was dismissed by the magistrate on the ground of a contention set up at the trial in order to show that the Butter had been sold as " Margarine," and not as genuine Butter. Sample No. 29 (Mustard) was found to contain foreign starch. The vendor of this mustard was warned by letter from the Vestry Clerk. Sample No. 49 was a butter which, in my opinion, contained 30 per cent. of " foreign fat." The vendor, after being summoned, produced a certificate of analysis signed 34 by another London Public Analyst, which, after giving the facts of his analysis, concluded:—" This article is therefore within the limits of possible genuine Butter according to the standard employed at Somerset House." I should have had to state that the season of the year (early in December, 1892), was very adverse to the production of Butter of a high quality. The certificate as to " foreign fat" also is inferential rather than demonstrable, as, in the case of diluted milk, is the certificate of " added" or " foreign water." Under all the circumstances I thought it right to advise the Sanitary Committee to withdraw the summons. This course was adopted, as more in harmony with the general feeling of the Vestry than the enforcement of a possibly harsh prosecution. Sample No. 50 was a Butter certified by me to contain 70 per cent. of foreign fat. The vendor was convicted by the magistrate and fined 40s. and costs. Sample 51 was another Butter certified by me as containing 50 per cent. of foreign fat, and the vendor of this was convicted and fined 20s. and costs. Samples 49 50 and 51 were all submitted to me in one batch of samples, and were analysed at the same time and by means of the same processes. No money or consideration, other than the stipend paid by the Vestry, has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 29, Dover Street, Piccadilly. 35 Samples submitted for Examination during year 1892. No. Article. Quality.
