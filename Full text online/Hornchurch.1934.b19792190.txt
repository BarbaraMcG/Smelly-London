Ac 4411(3) HORNCHURCH Hornchurch Urban District Council HORNC 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1934 ALFRED BALL, M.D., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health Hornchurch Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH 1934 ALFRED BALL, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health 3 "Langtons" Billet Lane, Hornchurch. 3rd June, 1935 To The Chairman and Members of the Hornchurch Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour herewith to present my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Circumstances of the District for the year 1934. It is to be recorded that the long anticipated Essex Review Order dealing with the revision of boundaries of county districts was issued on the 1st March, 1934, and as regards this district became operative on 1st April, 1934. The transference of duties and services in the 5- parishes added to Hornchurch from the late Rural District of Romford was accomplished with smoothness and efficiency owing to careful preparation which had gone on for some time previous to the change over. The enlargement of the area of the District has required a much larger staff to cope with the increase in the work devolving on the Council and the office accommodation admirable in character as it is, will need to be considerably enlarged at an early date. In the following pages will be found a description of the more important activities carried on in the Health Department, and at the end is a report on the Rural District for the first quarter of the year. I wish to acknowledge the ready assistance which I have received from my fellow officers in my work, and to thank the members of the Council for their support.

Area in acres (estimated and subject to revision) 19,082 Registrar-General's estimate of the resident population (midyear) 1934 55,798 Number of inhabited houses (end of 1934) according to Rate books 17,782 Rateable value (September, 1934) £431,570 Sum represented by a Penny Rate (September) £1,650 Social Conditions. The district is becoming increasingly residential in character and numerous building estates which are being developed continue to attract new residents and thus to increase the population by migration. There are, however, still large areas in the District in which market gardening, dairy farming, etc., form the chief industries. There are no conditions of occupation or environment which have had a prejudicial effect on health. Vital Statistics. Extracts from the Vital Statistics for the year.

The enlarged Urban District of Hornchurch as constituted on the 1st April, 1934, consisted of the above wards and parishes with the exception of a very small part of the North West Ward which was added to the Urban District of Romford ; and with the addition of more than half of the parish of Great Warley. The enlarged Hornchurch is divided into wards as follows :— No. of Local Government Electors, No. of Ward, October, 1934 Councillors Cranham 869 1 Emerson Park 4,263 3 Harold Wood 2,744 2 NorthWest 7,176 5 Rainham 2,779 2 Thameside 1,631 1 Town 5,700 4 Upminster 4,513 3 9 Rainfall during the Year. I am indebted to Mr. F. Alderson, the Surveyor, for the subjoined information on rainfall as recorded at the Sewage Disposal works on the Rainham Road, and the Eastern Outfall works at Bury Farm, Great Warley. Rainham Road Works— Amount of No. of days rainfall in which in inches rain fell January 1.08 15 February .09 3 March 1.98 19 April 2.22 13 May .48 8 June 1.02 7 July 79 6 August 1.89 12 September 1.11 8 October 1.23 14 November 1.56 9 December 4.06 25 Total 17.51 139 Eastern Outfall Works— January 1.16 18 February .27 5 March 1.89 16 April 1.33 15 May 37 4 June 1.09 7 July 68 6 August 1.98 11 September 1.07 8 October 1.85 13 November 1.57 8 December 3.32 22 Total 16.58 133 During the year 1933 rain fell on 141 days the total rainfall being 16.79 inches, and in the year 1932 the corresponding figures were 162 days and 19.15 inches. These figures were recorded at the Rainham Road works. Population. The census population of the different parts was enumerated in the years 1911, 1921 and 1931, as follows:— Year 1911 1921 1931 Cranham 489 519 1,240 Hornchurch 9,461 10,891 28,417 Rainham 1,972 2,196 3,897 Upminster 2,468 3,559 5,732 Wennington 364 432 359 Great Warley 2,051 2,088 2,676 10 The population of the Enlarged District for the middle of the year as estimated locally was 60,800. The Registrar-General's estimate of resident population for June 30th, 1934, is 55,798, but a figure modified to take account of the fact that the records do not wholly relate to the entire year has been calculated by the Registrar-General for use in connection with the statistical rates. This figure is 52,256. At the 1931 census in the Hornchurch Urban District as then constituted the number of persons enumerated in dwellings occupied by Private families was found to be 96 per cent. of the whole. In addition there were 53 persons (0.2 per cent.) in civilian hospitals; 639 persons (2.2 per cent.) in Poor Law Institutions; and 323 persons (1.1 per cent.) in Air Force premises. In the Romford Rural District 96.5 per cent. of the total census population consisted of private families. Births. The number of births registered during the year was 728. The figures supplied by the Registrar-General which take into account births occurring during temporary residence outside the District and correctly included in the Hornchurch figures are:— Males Females Legitimate 463 432 Illegitimate 19 8 The percentage of illegitimate births to the total registered was 2.9. The birth rate calculated on a population of 52,256 is 17.6 per thousand estimated population. A comparison with previous years follows:— 1933 18.4 1929 17.0 1932 18.1 1928 14.9 1931 20.1 1927 16.3 1930 16.1 1926 17.3 Deaths. There were 254 deaths registered in the District during the year, this number including 41 belonging to other districts. The deaths of Hornchurch residents registered as having died in other districts was 231. By subtracting the former and adding the latter a corrected total of 444 deaths is obtained. The figures of Hornchurch residents' deaths which occurred in outside institutions was:— Old church Hospital, Romford 146 Other Essex General P. A. Hospitals 7 Brentwood and Severalls Hospitals 3 Victoria Hospital, Romford 9 Romford Isolation Hospital 15 Queen Mary's Hospital, Stratford 3 King George Hospital, Ilford 7 London Hospital 8 11 Other Hospitals in London 19 Nursing Homes 3 Private houses 11 231 The percentage of deaths of Hornchurch residents occurring in Hospitals or other public institutions was 48.8 per cent. The crude death rate calculated on a population of 52,256 was 8.4 per thousand estimated population. A comparison with previous years follows:— 1933 7.8 1929 9.9 1932 7.9 1928 8.4 1931 8.4 1927 9.4 1930 8.2 1926 10.6 Comparative mortality after allowing for differences in the population constitution. The Registrar-General has supplied a comparability factor by which the crude death rate is to be multiplied in order to give a mortality figure which is strictly comparable with those of other districts to which the same treatment has been applied. The adjusted mortality rate for Hornchurch in the year 1934 thus obtained is 9.3. Coroner's Inquest or Enquiry. During the year 43 deaths (27 male and 16 female) which occurred in the District were investigated by the Coroner. They included the deaths of 8 persons belonging to other districts. Of the total of 43 in 19 cases an inquest was held; the Coroner certified the cause of death in 14 cases after autopsy; and in 10 other cases after enquiry alone. The classification into stated age-groups was as follows:— Age-group Number Age-group Number Under 1 year 3 45—54 years 4 1— 4 years 4 55—64 „ 5 5—14 3 65—74 „ 8 15—24 „ 1 75—84 3 25—34 „ 3 85—94 2 35—44 7 Causes of death certified in the 19 inquests:— Coal gas poisoning 7 (5 suicide : 2 misadventure) Injuries by motor vehicles 3 Other accidental injuries 2 Drowning 2 Crushing by railway train 1 (Suicide) Heart Disease 3 Septic Tonsillitis, etc. 1 Causes of death certified in 14 cases after autopsy:— Heart Disease 7 Tuberculosis 1 Miscellaneous diseases 6 12 Causes of death certified after enquiry Heart Disease 8 Bronchitis 1 Congenital malformation 1 Deaths in Certain Age-Groups During the Whole Year.

There are 5 registered Nursing and Maternity Homes in the District. MIDWIVES. The number of midwives practising in the District, some of whom live just outside, is 19. 6. Hospitals. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The Romford Joint Hospital District was constituted in the year 1899. It includes the Urban Districts of Hornchurch, Dagenham and Romford. The Joint Hospital Board consists of 4 elected representatives from Hornchurch, 5 from Dagenham and 3 from Romford and in addition the Chairman of each District is ex-officio a member. The Hospital Board has provided an Isolation Hospital at Rush Green containing approximately 150 beds. A scheme to provide about 100 additional beds is now under consideration. During the year 255 patients were admitted to the Isolation Hospital from this District including 134 cases of Diphtheria, 112 cases of Scarlet Fever, 2 cases of Cerebrospinal Fever, 2 cases of Meningitis, 1 case of Measles, 1 cases of Pneumonia and 3 others. Furthermore 13 cases of Diphtheria and 7 cases of Scarlet Fever were sent for treatment to the London Fever Hospital or to London County Council Fever Hospitals, owing to lack of accommodation in the Romford Isolation Hospital. SMALLPOX. The Romford Joint Hospital Board has an agreement by which cases of Smallpox may be sent for isolation and treatment to the Orsett Smallpox Hospital. The Board paid the sum of £99 as a retaining fee during the last financial year. No case of Smallpox occurred in this District during the year. 7. Legislation. Byelaws which are in force in the District have been made with respect to:— (1) Nuisances in connection with the removal of offensive matters. (2) Common Lodging houses.

This section requires the registration of every manufacturer or vendor of ice cream and also of any premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream. Power is given to the Local Authority under certain circumstances either to refuse an application for registration or to remove premises from the register. 19 SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water. The South Essex Waterworks Company provide a constant supply of water which is satisfactory in quality and has been equal to all demands made on the Company. A drought was experienced in some parts of the country but in this District it was not found necessary to impose any restrictions on the use of water for domestic purposes or for watering gardens. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. Further consideration has been given to the problem of sewage disposal with the object of abolishing small works and at the same time making full provision for the needs of the District. Negotiations were carried on with the Romford Council for the enlargement of their disposal works situated in Hornchurch and for the construction of main sewers which would serve the needs of both Districts. Finally an Agreement was drawn on the 17th January, 1934, by which a Joint Committee known as the Romford and Hornchurch Joint Sewerage Committee was established consisting of 5 members from each Authority. This Joint Committee will exercise the functions of a Local Authority relating to the management and control of the disposal of sewage and the common sewers upon the terms and conditions described in the Agreement. The common sewers which will be under the control of the Committee are:— (1) High Level 48 ins. sewer in length about 1,382 yards from the Sewage Works. (2) Low Level 18 ins. sewer in length about 2,168 yards from the Sewage Works. (3) Ravensbourne Valley sewer from Gallows Corner to the point where it joins the main sewer. (4) Ingrebourne Valley Sewer. The Agreement provides for the construction of the Ravensbourne Valley sewer under the direction of the Romford Council. The contract price which has been accepted is £19,920. Contracts have been signed for the construction of the Ingrebourne valley sewer at a cost of £16,292 19s. Od. and the extension of the Sewage works at a cost of £47,911 under the direction of the Hornchurch Council. When the extensions to the Outfall works at Bretons Farm have been completed and the Ravensbourne and Ingrebourne Valley sewers constructed and connected, the Harold Wood, Upminster, and Rainham Road works will be abolished and the whole of the District will be drained to two works, viz.

Serum is available for the use of medical practitioners on application, but it is usually administered at the hospital on admission. Cases are admitted to the Isolation hospital on a clinical diagnosis and practitioners are advised not to wait for a report on a swab. SCHICK TESTING AND ARTIFICIAL IMMUNISATION. Cases of Diphtheria having occurred in a residential school Dr. E. James, Medical Superintendent of the Isolation Hospital, very kindly schick-tested 23 boarders and administered immunising doses of T.A.F. to 18 of the 20 children who were found to be positive to the test. At the end of the year these children had not been retested as a sufficient period had not elapsed since the last immunising injection. Measles. During the year 731 cases of Measles were reported by Head Teachers as occurring among school children. There were 6 deaths from Measles, the rate per 1,000 population being 0.11. The ages at death were: 17—20 months in three instances : one 3 years : one 6 years: and.one 13 years. The complications stated on the death certificates being the determining causes of death were: Broncho-pneumonia (3): Purpura (1): Otitis Media (1): Adenitis (1). Five of the six cases were treated in hospital. When the new wards to be provided under the scheme now under consideration by the Joint Hospital Board have been built it is hoped that it will be possible to admit all cases of Measles and Whooping Cough with complications needing hospital treatment. Whenever the accommodation in the Isolation Hospital permits such cases will take precedence over mild uncomplicated cases of Scarlet Fever when the latter can be isolated at home satisfactorily. Whooping Cough. The incidence of Whooping Cough was low. One death, that of a child aged 16 months was certified. Abortus Fever. One case, that of a person being treated in a general hospital outside the District, was reported to be suffering from this infection. The source could not be traced. Ophthalmia Neonatorum.
