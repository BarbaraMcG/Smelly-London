PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Borough of JVest Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gkntlemkn, I beg to submit my annual report of the year 1900. Being a record or summary of work done which has already been reported from time to time to the Public Health Committee, the main facts will, doubtless, be more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. I have delayed its issue with a view to enable the statistics to be recalculated upon the sound data furnished by the 1901 Census. I have also included some recommendations contained in unreport for 1899, upon which no action was taken during the year 1900. The work of the Public Health Department increases yearly ; and it is my pleasing duty to record the ungrudging assistance rendered me by the whole of my stafi—often at considerable personal inconvenience. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. a 2 4 VITAL STATISTICS. Area and Population.— The area of the County Borough of West Ham is 4,706 acres. Latitude 51'° 30'—51° 33' N. Longitude 0- 1'W.—0o3'E. The Census population in 1891 was 204,902. The inhabited houses numbered 32,066. The number of persons per house was 6.3, and the number of persons per acre was 43.5. At the middle of the year 1900 the Registrar-General estimated the population at 314,000, while his estimate for the middle of 1901 was 329,377—this estimate being based upon the ratio of increase between the years 1881 and 1891. At the Census taken on the 1st April, 1901, however, the enumerated population of the Borough proved to be only 267,308, an increase of 62,405 on the population of 1891, but 62,069 less than the Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the middle of 1901. I have not been able to examine the particulars of other districts, but it is very doubtful if any show so great a discrepancy between estimate and record as West Ham, a discrepancy due entirely to the assumption that the very rapid increase between the years 1881 and 1891 would be maintained during the succeeding ten years. The Census has enabled me to recalculate a corrected estimate of the population at the middle of each year since 1891, which I give below:— Year. Corrected estimate of population at the middle of the year. 1891 206,463 1892 212,703 1893 218,943 1894 225,183 1895 231,423 1896 237,663 1897 243,904 1898 250,145 1899 256,386 1900 262,627 1901 268,868 5 It may here be stated that the rates given in my periodical reports have been based upon a figure 30,000 less than the estimate of the Registrar-General, but also 30,000 more than the now discovered corrected estimate. All the rates in this report relating to the year 1900 are calculated on the result of the recent Census, and all the rates for past years contained in the tables at the end of the report have been recalculated upon the corrected estimates of population given above. Although more properly falling within the report for 1901, it may be useful here to record that the Census returns show an increase in the number of persons per acre, and a slight increase in the number of persons per house:— Census, 1891. Census, 1901. Number of inhabited houses 32,066 41,433 Number of persons per acre 43.5 56.8 Number of persons per house 6.3 6.4 Births and Deaths. The number of births registered during the year was 8,885, being 106 in excess of the previous year, equivalent to an annual birth-rate of 33.8 per 1,000. Distributed to the various registration sub-districts, the births were as follows:— Registration Sub-District. Births. Sex. Stratford 1,448 786 Males 662 Females Forest Gate 1,595 809 Males 786 Females Plaistow 3,189 1610 Males 1579 Females Canning Town 2,65.3 1361 Males 1292 Females The number of deaths registered was 5,156, being 57 fewer than the deaths in 1899, equivalent to an annual death rate of 19.6 per 6 1,000 living. This recorded death-rate on being corrected for age and sex distribution is raised to 21.1 per 1,000, the corresponding rate for the year 1899 being 21 -8 per 1,000. I give below the deaths occurring in the four registration subdistricts, together with particulars as to area, inhabited houses, ami population culled from the 1901 Preliminary Census Abstract:— Registration Sub-District. Area in Acres. Inhabited Houses. Population. Deaths Registered in Sub-District in 1900. 1891. 1901. 1801. 1901.

Four years having passed, I have, with the assistance of the Health Visitors, again made a personal canvass of most of the selected areas. The Woodgrange area has not been checked, as its population is comparatively stationary, and apart from a slight excess of births over deaths, otters little opportunity of growth. The Stratford Marsh area has been withdrawn from the group under consideration, owing to the fact that several of the houses are closed, and the whole area will shortly be rebuilt by your Council, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. I append herewith the particulars of the other districts as they show certain variations when compared with the particulars contained in my 1897 report. It will 7 also be useful next year to compare these figures with those obtained at the recent Census, and I trust you will empower me to apply to the Superintending Registrar for this purpose. The tendency of many occupiers, in replying to the questions of sanitary officials, lies rather in the direction of understating the number of persons living in their houses, and for this reason it is possible the following populations may be under-estimated. If so, the death-rates calculated thereon will appear higher than they actually were:— Particulars as to Population of Special Areas. Street. No. of Houses. No. of Children under 13.

They differ considerably, one from the other, and from the general death-rate of the Borough. Generally speaking, the death-rates are higher than in previous years, which I largely attribute to measles, which, in the earlier months of the year, was very prevalent in Canning Town and West Silvertown, in the latter district necessitating the closure of the infants' department of a 11 school. It is, however, patent that, at present a high death-rate in a poor district is not to be explained by any one cause. Many factors in varying degrees operate in producing the infant holocaust of our great towns, of which, doubtless, alcoholic excesses may still be safely placed first, and it cannot be gainsaid that the tendency displayed in recent years of increasing intemperance among women is fraught with deadlier results than the past abuse of intoxicants by the male population.

Of these Diarrhoea was responsible for 489 deaths, Measles for 143, and Whooping Cough for 183—an improvement, compared with the previous year, in the two former cases. As these diseases are not notifiable, it is impossible to estimate the number of cases which occurred. Small-pox threatened the Borough at the beginning of the year, 11 cases in all being notified to me. I quote the particulars, as they reveal some of the various ways in which this highly-infectious disease is spread :— (1) Charles Sermon, aged 34. Notified 8th January from the Seamen's Hospital, was removed by the Metropolitan 12 Asylums Board to Hospital ships. Patient employed on s.s. Arabia, which arrived in Albert Dock on 22nd December, 1899, having landed a case of Variola at Gravesend. (2) William Long, aged 39, of 15, Chauntler Road. Vaccinated in infancy. Rash on 6th January. Notified and removed to Dagenham Hospital on 8th January. Patient employed as ship's carpenter on s.s. Arabia. Vide Case No. 1. The s.s. Arabia sailed on 4th January, but is reported to have put off a case of illness, suspected to be Small-pox, at Plymouth. The above patient is the first to be treated in our new Dagenham Small-pox Hospital. (3) Alfred Girdwood, aged 30, of 24, Plashet Road. nated in infancy. Attacked 18th January. Rash 21st January. Notified and removed to Dagenham Hospital 22nd January. Patient had been staying at Bigby, near Brigg, in Lincolnshire, from 24th December to 6th January. (Small-pox prevalent at Hull.) (4) Ernest Cornish, 8 months, 95, Rokebv Street. Notified 15th February. (Not Small-pox.) (5) Daisy Cutbush, aged 18; 111, Plashet Road. Notified 17th February. Removed to Dagenham. (Not Smallpox.) (6) Fred. Morriss, aged 6; 42, Milton Road. Vaccination doubtful. Attacked 16th February. Rash 20th February. Notified by Medical Officer of Health. Removed to Dagenham, 23rd February. Daisy Morriss, aged 6, a sister of Fred, was attacked on 6th February, had a severe rash on 8th, and died on 14th February. In view of after events, it is probable this illness was Variola. Charles Morriss, 13 a brother of Daisy and Fred, living in same house, was employed to disinfect 15, Chauntler road, on 9th January. Vide Case No. 2. (7) William Morriss, aged 56; 42, Milton Road, father of above. Vaccinated in infancy, two marks. Attacked 24th February. Rash 27th February. Notified by Medical Officer of Health, and removed to Dagenham 27th February. Died 2nd March. (8) Sarah Ann Morriss, aged 18. Vaccinated in infancy, four marks. A few spots only appearing on body, 16th February. Removed to Dagenham. Patient helped to nurse her sister, Daisy. Vide Case No. 6. (9) Eleanor Elizabeth Morriss, aged 23; 76, Portway. nated in infancy, four marks. Attacked, 2nd March. Rash, 4th March. Notified and removed to Dagenham, 4th March. Patient sat up with Fred. Morriss during funeral of Daisy. Vide Case No. 6. (10) Annie Taylor, aged 22; 13, Morton Road. Rash, 3rd March. Notified and removed to Dagenham, 8th March. Friend and visitor of the Morriss family. (11) P. N. Jones, aged 35; 497, Barking Road. Notified and removed to Dagenham, 9th April. (Not Small-pox.) The value of prompt removal to hospital of cases of Small-pox is undoubted, but the preventive value of efficient vaccination and re-vaccination is, in my opinion, equally strong, and in view of the diminished percentage of primary vaccinations during recent years and the almost entire absence of re-vaccination, it will not be surprising to find that our Dagenham Hospital alone proves quite 14 inadequate to stem a severe epidemic, should it attack the increasingly unprotected population. Diphtheria.—The epidemic prevalence of Diphtheria, which was the occasion of a special report by me at the end of 1899, maintained a strong hold upon the Borough during the greater part of the year 1900. In all 1,300 cases were notified during the year, while 161 deaths were recorded, giving respectively an attack rate of 4'91 per 1,000 living, and a death rate of '61 per 1,000. I have previously pointed out that, until the life history of the Diphtheria bacillus is accurately determined, it will be impossible to prevent epidemics of this disease, or, indeed, to satisfactorily explain the anomalies which at present occur in its attack upon or retreat from different towns. At the end of the year I furnished the Council with figures showing that several towns of widely differing characteristics were suffering to a greater extent in this respect than West Ham—notably Brighton, Leicester, Sheffield, and Leeds. Epidemics have been shown to follow long-continued deficiency of rainfall such as has pertained in West Ham for several years past : but there can be little doubt that, so far as the great towns are concerned, the improved facilities for inter-communication both in school and out of school form the chief cause of the spread. As regards the influence of personal infection at school, I have this year been enabled to investigate and detect several cases in which children have been in attendance at school in a probably infectious condition. Through the kind assistance of the head teachers, I was supplied with the dates of absence from school of all scholars living in houses infected with Diphtheria. The number of children on the roll in the 42 Board Schools was 46,233, and of non-Board Schools, 8,672. . 1,390'children (2'5 per cent.) were, in response to notice by me to the head teacher, precluded, for a varying period, from attending school on account of Diphtheria. On comparing the date of last attendance with the date given by the friends as the date of the onset of first 15 symptoms of illness, several cases were obtained in which children who were apparently sufficiently ill to cause remark on the part of the parent, and who, in the light of the subsequent illness, were possibly a danger to their schoolmates, were yet allowed to go to school. These cases would not be likely to attract the attention of the school teacher, but were none the less a potent source of evil. As a further instance of the way in which Diphtheria may be spread through unrecognized cases and in the earlier stages of the disease, I may point out the time which sometimes elapses between the date of attack and the time when notification of the disease is received. Out of 1,200 cases of Diphtheria, the number of days elapsing between the alleged onset of the illness and the receipt of the notification certificate is shown in the following table:— No. of days between attack and notitication. No. of cases. No. of days between attack and notification. No. of. cases. 1 131 12 5 2 295 13 7 3 294 14 3 4 229 15 1 5 132 16 2 6 61 17 2 1 53 18 3 8 15 19 — 9 13 20 — 10 5 21 4 11 4 22 1 16 Zymotic Disease in Special Areas.—In previous years I hav-e shown, as might be expected, that the zymotic death-rate in the specially-selected areas where persons and houses are crowded together are exceptionally heavy, and in this respect the year 1900 17 gave higher rates than I have had occasion to publish, as may be seen from the table below:— Area.

In my last annual report I called especial attention to the approaching congress, to be held in London, of the National Society for the Prevention of Consumption, and pointed out the advisability of taking definite action with a view to the discovery of the causes which produce the disease or predispose the feeble to acquire it. The points to which I drew attention were: — 1. Prevention of Sale of Tuberculous milk. 2. Voluntary Notification of Phthisis. 3. Sterilization of Milk supply. 4. Visitation of Cases. 5. Disinfection and Cleansing after Death. B 2 20 The last two subjects were capable of being applied by my Department, and have been adopted where required, but the other subjects require the definite resolution of the Council before action can be taken. At the forthcoming congress papers will be read and discussion allowed emphasizing the necessity of adopting some measures of this kind if any real attempt is to be made to prevent the present large phthisical death-roll. Your Council has already at the request of the London County Council undertaken to supply that body with information and veterinary reports respecting the condition of cows, byres, etc., in West Ham, if examination should show that Tuberculous milk derived from West Ham was being sold in London. It is needless to point out that such a sale is unlikely to occur, at least in any quantity ; most of the milk derived from West Ham cowsheds probably, is distributed in West Ham itself. To prevent Tuberculous milk being sold it is necessary to examine the cows in order to ascertain cases of Tubercular disease of the udder, and I again suggest that a quarterly examination by the Veterinary Inspector would prove an additional safeguard to the public health. The questions of voluntary notification of Phthisis, and the Steri• lization of our own milk supply are debatable, but I venture to think that the systematic examination of cows, with a view to detecting obvious lesions, which have been shown to be a public danger, must necessarily fall within the incumbent duties of a progressive Sanitarv Authority. I append a list of premises where cows are kept, which, in my opinion, should be periodically visited, and in some of which the Inspectors of Nuisances have occasion to serve notices to abate overcrowding and to abate sanitary defects :— 14, Maryland Koad. 71, Carpenters' Road. 20, Vicarage Lane. 21 149, Neville Road. 4, Randall Street. Chesterton Road. 16, Mason Street. Edwin Street. 32, Woodstock Street. 32, Thomas Street. 11, Idmiston Road. 10, Abbey Lane. 25, Church Street (North). 235, Star Lane. 169, Balaam Street. 44, Grange Road. 281, Beckton Road. 25, Poplar Street. 36, Rathbone Street. 40, Queen's Road. 257, High Street, Stratford. 16, Ross Road. 23, Beale Street. 1, Blanche Street. 22, Whitwell Road. 7, Edward Street, Barking Road. 2, Warmington Street. 2, Edward Street, St. Luke's Square. 18, Burke Street. 23, Charles Street, Plaistow. Sewerage System.—On May 23rd, 1900, the New Pumping Station, at Abbey Mills, commenced working, and on January 27th, 1901, the Silvertown Sewerage System, serving that portion of the Borough south of the Docks, was diverted from the Silvertown Pumping Station into the Metropolitan Sewer at North Woolwich. These two dates passed off without any ceremonial, but they deserve to be held in remembrance, as by the combined operation the 22 whole of the sewage of West Ham, which had hitherto passed into the Thames and into Bow Creek, began to be delivered into the Metropolitan system to be henceforward treated at the Northern Outfall—an undoubted gain to the public health of the Borough. Housing of the Working Classes Act. Under Part II of this Act, I represented the under-mentioned houses as being unfit for human habitation, and your Council ordered proceedings to be taken in each case with the result shown below:— Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Lea Street, Stratford Rendered fit. Nos. 14 and 15, Abbey Road, „ Closed by owners. Nos 1, 3, 5, Marshgate Lane, „ Rendered fit. Under Part III of the Act, with a view to the demolition and re-erection of houses on the Channelsea Estate, the Council obtained an Order of Quarter Sessions authorizing the closing of the roads upon this estate, and also obtained from the Local Government Board sanction of a loan for 40 years, of the sum of £29,020, for the building of 59 houses under the Act. During the year the Council applied to the Public Works Loan Commissioners for the under-mentioned sums:— Site. Object of Loan Amount. Bethell Avenue Land £1,178 Bethell Avenue Houses 10,798 Corporation Street and Eve Road Land 5,950 Corporation Street Houses 23,927 Invicta and Rendel Roads Land 2,273 Manor Road Land 11,750 Temple Mill Lane Land 4,550 £60,426 Sanitary Inspection.—The general work of the Inspectors of Nuisances is necessarily shown in the various tables at the end of this report, where also will he seen the actual houses inspected. The 23 time occupied in this class of work has increased considerably since 1898, owing to the frequency with which main drains serving houses belonging to various owners require repair, and the intricate points involved in many such cases lead to unavoidable delay in the execution of the work. During the last year the worst districts of the Borough have had the advantage of the visits made by the two Health Visitors, who were appointed for the purpose of instructing and aiding the poorer inhabitants in the care and management of their houses. I give below one of the leaflets they have left as occasion required:— The Management of Children. 1. Eyes.—The first thing to be done on the birth of a baby is to gently wash the eyelids. If a baby's eyes run with matter and look red a few days after birth, take it at once to a doctor. Delay is dangerous, and one or both eyes may be destroyed if not treated immediately. The discharge is infectious. 2. Washing Baby.—Give baby a bath night and morning, using tepid water and a little soap. If accustomed to it from the first, even the youngest child will enjoy it. This, with care in changing clothes and sponging and washing gently with flannel, will promote general health and prevent "scalding." 3. Dressing Baby.—The clothing should be warm and fit easily with flannel next the skin. Tight bandaging, with the notion of "supporting" the body, is not only unnecessary but hurtful. Warmth is essential to an infant, and until children are able to run about no part of the body except the head and hands should be left bare. 4. Feeding Baby.—A newly-born baby should be put to the breast as soon as it is washed and dressed. This is best for both mother and child. The milk first supplied by the mother acts as a laxative, so that castor-oil is unnecessary. Should the mother have no milk at first, pure cow's milk (mixed with hot water and sugar as described below) may be given until she is ready to nurse. 24 Provided the mother has plenty of breast milk, the child should get nothing else until it is six months old. Put baity to the breast for the first six weeks every two hours during the day and less frequently as it grows older. During the night it requires to be fed less often. It is a mistake to suppose that whenever a baby cries it requires the breast. Regular habits may be cultivated from the earliest age, and a mother who early trains her baby in regular habits of feeding, will find it easier, in after years, to teach her child to be regular at school, regular at work, and regular in returning home from work. It is dangerous to fall asleep with baby at the breast. The child may be smothered, or indigestion and colic may be produced. If the mother have not enough breast milk, it must lbe supplemented with a mixture of two-thirds pure milk to one-third warm water, with sugar. If, unfortunately, the baby must be brought up entirely "on the bottle," then (1) Use only pure, fresh milk, in the proportion of two measures of milk to one measure of hot water, with a little sugar (about three good teaspoonfuls to three-quarters of a pint). (2) Prepare no more than can be taken at once. What is left should be thrown out. (3) Never lay baby down to sleep with the teat in its mouth. This is sure to cause colic. (4) Wash the bottle carefully immediately after each meal, and lay it in cold water until required again. The greatest care must be taken to wash out the india-rubber tube and teat, so that no bits of curded milk may be left. This is so difficult to do properly, that the boat-shaped feeding-bottle is much safer to use. (5) In hot, sultry weather, dilute the milk with a third part of lime-water instead of pure water, and then make warm. If possible, use "sterilized" milk. (6) There is no substitute for good milk, and no necessity for supplementing it. Cornflour, arrowroot, and such starchy foods are bad for young infants. 5. Weaning Baby.—The baby should be weaned by degrees, and as a rule should not have the breast after the ninth month. After the sixth or seventh month bread and milk or soaked biscuits may be 25 given once or twice a day, and later cornflour, oatmeal, boiled rice, and other farinaceous food may be gradually introduced into the diet During the passing of the second year, as the teeth develop, gravy, broth, and finally meat may be given for dinner, but milk should form half the child's diet till it is four years old. Avoid the habit of allowing young children to share their parents' food. Take the trouble of making wholesome food specially for them, and do not ruin their stomachs and risk their lives by giving them tea, intoxicating drink, beef, &c. 6. Fresh Air and Exercise.—Nobody will drink dirty water, but few appear to mind breathing dirty air. Babies and young children suffer more than grown persons from badly-ventilated houses. They are tenderer and pass the greater part of their time in the house. Keep your windows a little open at the top, and in the day time as wide open as possible. Remember that bad air is worse than cold air. Never keep slops or dirt of any kind inside your house a minute longer than is necessary. Take your children out for a walk every fine day. A walk will do both mother and child far more good than gossiping to a neighbour and playing in the street. Avoid taking children out at night or in wet cold weather. 7. Sleep.—Don't accustom your baby to be rocked or nursed to sleep, or to sleep in your arms. Fresh air makes sleep more healthful. The air cannot be fresh if the bed clothes are dirty. Young children in bed with their parents may be injured or even smothered by getting wholly beneath the bed clothes, and the smell of a mother's milk-stained shift always makes a baby restless or fretty. Make baby a little bed for itself. Sleep comes naturally to a healthy child. Wakefulness means illness. During teething, when the baby is irritable and restless, never use soothing syrups, sleeping draughts, laudanum, &c.; a little patience will overcome the wakefulness, and the baby will be far better in the morning than if drugged to sleep. 26 8. To Nursing Mothers.—The living connection between the body of the mother and the body of the child, which exists before birth, and makes both suffer from injurious influences, continues throughout the period of suckling. Nursing mothers should avoid fatigue and worry, live on plain nutritious diet, and avoid spirits. For a nursing mother to drink whiskey, etc., is almost as bad as to give it to the baby directly, which would be to poison it. 9. To Both Parents.—You have now assumed the greatest responsibility of your lives—to guard the body and train the mind of your own child—and to do this, you must yourselves possess "a healthy mind in a healthy body." Have you that? "Most of us might be well, if we would. It is very much our own fault that we are ill. We do those things which we ought not to do, and we leave undone those things which we ought to have done and then we wonder that there is no health in us." C. S. Public Health Department, Town Hall, West Ham. The value of this visitation may be estimated by the summary of M iss Heaviside's work from April 23rd to December 23rd:— Streets visited 64 Houses „ 2,691 Persons „ 19,084 First visits 4,500 Second „ 282 Improvements 238 Houses with defects... 2,503 Houses with cases of illness 585 Miss R. E. Gardiner was equally active, but unfortunately has been compelled to resign, on the score of ill-health, in the midst of her work. 27 It is only fair to these ladies to say that their work was carried out under frequent difficulties. Being without statutory office they were exposed, in some instances, to rudeness on the part of the tenant and obstruction on the part of the landlord. In two cases the landlord instructed his tenants not to admit the Health Visitors, but we have changed all that. Work of Lady Inspector of Nuisances. Factory and Workshop Acts.

Margarine Acts. In March, 1900, the Council appointed an additional Inspector of Nuisances (Mr. H. J. Warwick) to devote his whole time to the taking samples of food for analysis, and for the better examination of food. This has enabled an increasing number of analyses to be made with a consequent diminution in the percentage ofadulterations. Under these Acts, 751 samples were purchased for analysis, and 98 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated. I applied for summonses, at the hearing of which fines and costs were imposed by the Magistrate, amounting to £381 6s. 6d. 32 Particulars of the adulteration are given in the table below:— Article Genuine.

The total amount collected during the 306 working days of the year 1900, amounted to 25,923 loads, a decrease of 712 loads on the previous year. This decrease is caused through abolishing the material carts that were used last year, having the iron covers removed from the vans, and tarpaulins used to cover all the vehicles collecting house refuse, so, although the loads are less, the tonnage is greater than last year.

Plague.—In September, 1900, the Local Government Board, by Order, made regulations including Plague within the list of notifiable diseases specified in the Notification Act, 1889, and also distributed Memoranda upon the subject, which are printed below:— A copy of the Order was enclosed by me with a Circular Letter to all medical men practising in the Borough. I received notification of one suspected case of Plague in Canning Town, which I visited; and subsequently submitted a specimen of the patient's blood, together with a report of the case to the Local Government Board. Fortunately, this proved not to be a case of Pestis. 41,820. 19th September, 1900. Epidemic Regulations: Notification of Cases of Plague General. To All Sanitary Authorities in England and Wales as herein defined:— 41 To All Medical Officers of Health of the Sanitary Authorities aforesaid:— And to all others whom it may concern. WHEREAS England and Wales appear to be threatened with Plague, and it is desirable that regulations should be made as hereinafter contained: Now therefore, We, the Local Government Board, in the exercise of the powers given to Us by the Public Health Acts, and any other Acts enabling Us in this behalf, do, by this Our Order, make the following Regulations, and Declare the same to be in force in the District of every Sanitary Authority in England and Wales, and to apply to all vessels within the jurisdiction of a Port Sanitary Authority or a Riparian Authority: I.—In this Order— The expression "Sanitary Authority" means every Port Sanitary Authority and every Council of a County Borough and every Urban or Rural District Council, and in the Administrative County of London every Sanitary Authority for the execution of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The expression "Medical Officer of Health" includes any dulyqualified Medical Practitioner appointed or employed by a Sanitary Authority to act in the execution of any regulations made by Us in pursuance of any of the enactments referred to in this Order. II.—In the District of every Sanitary Authority which is situate without the Administrative County of London, the persons mentioned in Section 3 of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, and the Sanitary Authority shall, under this Order, have the same powers 42 and duties in relation to the notification of cases of Plague as they would have under that Act if Plague were an infectious disease to which that Act applied In the District of every Sanitary Authority in the Administrative County of London, and in the District of the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London, the persons mentioned in Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (including the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District), and the Sanitary Authority shall, under this Order, have the same powers and duties in relation to the notification of cases of Plague as they would have under that Section if Plague were an infectious disease to which that Section applied. The Sanitary Authority shall forthwith cause Circular Letters to be sent to all legally-qualified Medical Practitioners in the District, informing them of their duties under this Regulation. III.—It shall be the duty of every Medical Officer of Health to report forthwith to Us any case of Plague which may be notified to him, or which may otherwise come or be brought to his knowledge, and which may occur in the District or Area assigned to his charge. Given under the Seal of Office of the Local Government Board, this Nineteenth day of September, in the year One thousand nine hundred. HENRY CHAPLIN President. WILL. ED. KNOLLYS, Assistant Secretary. 43 Plague Memorandum. (1) Administrative Considerations. Plague having for the space of nearly two centuries receded from Europe, has in recent years once more trended westward, and has now again appeared in Great Britain. Sanitary Authorities of England and Wales will therefore need to he on the alert to detect the presence of this disease in their districts, with a view to prevent its becoming epidemic among their populations. It is to be anticipated, from the behaviour thus far of the recent western extension of the disease, that Plague will not readily fasten 011 that section of our population which is properly housed, cleanly, and generally, in a sanitary sense, well-to-do; that rather it will especially affect, if it obtains foothold in one and another district, insanitary areas such as are peopled by the poorest class, and where overcrowding of persons in houses and dirt and squalor of dwellings and of inhabitants tend to prevail. In these circumstances the following facts respecting Plague deserve to be borne in mind:— (1) Plague has an incubation period of 3 to 5 (in exceptional cases of perhaps 8 to 10) days. (2) Plague is wont, especially in its earlier manifestations, to assume a mild form, or even to present anomalous symptoms, tending to confound it with other and more innocent diseases. (3) Plague in all its forms must needs be regarded as sonally infective. (4) Plague affects rats as well as the human subject; it may, indeed, be found causing mortality among these lower animals, antecedent to its definite invasion of the population. There can be no doubt that the rat and man are, as regards Plague, reciprocally infective 44 Although Local Authorities should be on their guard against Plague, it is not intended to suggest that there exists any cause for alarm. There can be no doubt that, in this country, hygienic conditions and methods of dealing with infectious diseases are far in advance of those of former centuries wherein Plague was repeatedly epidemic in our populations; they are in advance too, as we believe, of those in localities abroad where Plague has shown itself formidable in recent years. And in so far as, in our districts, these conditions and methods are now satisfactory and sufficient, there is the less likelihood of spread of infection from Plague cases casually imported. During the past 50 years there has occurred in England and Wales a large diminution in the mortality from most diseases of the infectious class, and in the same period Typhus Fever has declined almost to extinction. This latter disease is that which, as regards the conditions under which it becomes prevalent, most closely resembles Plague. Wherefore it may be confidently anticipated that the measures of sanitary improvement, of isolation and of disinfection, which have been found effectual against indigenous disease such as Typhus will, if promptly and thoroughly brought to bear, be equally effectual against Plague. First among measures requisite for control of Plague is prompt information to the Local Authority of all cases of the disease occurring in their district. The Board, therefore, have issued an Order requiring, under penalty, immediate notification to the Medical Officer of Health of the district, and by him to the Board, of every recognized case of Plague. Meanwhile, and in order to help toward recognition of this disease in its obscurer manifestations, a statement of the clinical features exhibited by this malady will be found in Part (2) of this Memorandum. Further, and with a view to assisting in the identification of Plague newly developing in one and another district, the Board have arranged for bacteriological testing, without cost to the Local Authority, of material submitted to their Medical Officer by the Medical Officer of Health from the earliest suspected case or cases.* * Directions for collecting and forwarding suspected material are issued by the Local Government Board to Medical Officers of Health. 45 In the event of Plague being detected in any district, the measures to be taken to prevent its spread are, generally speaking, those which are available against the more ordinary epidemic diseases of this country, as set forth in the accompanying "General Memorandum." These measures include prompt removal of the sick persons to hospital and their isolation therein; the destruction or thorough disinfection of all infected articles, with the effectual disinfection also of the invaded dwelling-place; the keeping under observation during 10 days after detection of each Plague case all persons who have been in contact with the patient, and house-to-house visitation for the discovery of unreported or suspicious cases; the abatement as speedily as possible of all insanitary conditions in the locality which may tend to the spread of the disease; and, in the case of death, the prompt disposal of the corpse, with all due precautions against its becoming a source of infection. An essential measure of precaution in view of the observed relation between Plague in rats and Plague in the human subject, will be the prompt destruction of all rats in districts threatened or invaded by Plague, care being taken that their carcases are collected and burnt without being unduly handled. It is to be noted that when treated in a well-appointed hospital, with plentiful fresh air and proper attention to cleanliness and disinfection, Plague, except in its pneumonic and septicæmic forms, shows but small infective power; and that therefore doctors and nurses in attendance on the sick run but little risk of contracting the disease. Nevertheless, these and other persons brought in close relation with Plague, may be afforded protection against infection by submitting themselves to protective inoculation of the sort practised with advantage to the inhabitants of invaded areas by Professor Haffkine, under the auspices of the Indian Government, in Bombay. As yet the protective material in question is not generally purchasable in this country. For the present, therefore, and until further notice, the Board, having provided themselves with a supply of Professor Haffkine's Plague prophylactic, will be prepared to issue this material 46 in limited amount to the Medical Officers of Health of districts actually invaded by Plague, for the protection therein of doctors, nurses, and other persons that are, under the conditions of the invaded area, being subjected to sustained exposure to Plague infection. (2) Symptoms of Plague. An ordinary attack of Plague usually begins some three to five days after exposure to infection. Such attack may develop gradually, but, as commonly met with, there is sudden onset with much fever, as indicated by a high temperature, rapid pulse, headache, hot skin, and thirst. The eyes are injected as if inflamed: the expression, at first anxious and frightened, becomes subsequently vacant and dull; the utterance is thick, and the gait unsteady as in one under the influence of drink. There is at times a distinct tendency to faint. The tongue is at first covered with a. moist white fur except at the edges, which are red, but later on it becomes dry and of a mahogany colour. The most distinctive sign of Plague is the presence of swellings, or "buboes" as they are called, in the groin, armpit, or neck. These "buboes." which led to the disease being called "Bubonic Plague," and which have no relation to venereal complaints, appear, as a rule, about the second or third day of the disease. They are usually painful and tender on pressure, and in size they vary from that of an almond to that of an orange. Later 011 they may "gather" and burst like an ordinary abscess. There may, too, appear about the body purple spots, and what are known as "carbuncles." But "buboes" are not an essential feature of Plague. Cases occur in which these manifestations of the disease are greatly delayed or even absent, as for instance in "Pneumonic," "Gastric," and "Septicæmic" Plague; forms of the malady which may be mistaken for, respectively, inflammation of the lungs. Typhoid Fever, and acute blood poisoning. Plague in these forms is always grave; not only because of the fatality of the cases, but for the reason that they, especially the "Pneumonic," are highly infectious to other persons. 47 It is important, therefore, that in localities where Plague is present or is threatened, cases of anomalous illness of the above sorts be, without loss of time, brought under medical supervision. Besides the forms of Plague already referred to there is yet another, namely, the so-called "ambulant" form. In Plague of this description the affected person is hardly ill at all, presenting no definite symptoms perhaps beyond indolent, though painful, swellings in groin or armpit. Such Plague cases may, nevertheless, be instrumental in spreading the disease, and any persons therefore who, having been possibly exposed to Plague, exhibit these symptoms, should he isolated and watched medically until the nature of their malady has been definitely ascertained. W. H. POWER, Medical Officer. Local Government Board, Medical Department, September, 1900. General Memorandum on the Proceedings which are advisable in Places attacked or threatened by Epidemic Disease. 1. Wherever there is prevalence or threatening of Cholera, Diphtheria, Fever, or any other epidemic disease, it is of more than common importance that the statutory powers conferred upon Local Authorities for the protection of the public health should be well exercised by those Authorities, acting with the advice of their Medical Officers of Health. 2. Proper precautions are equally requisite for all classes of society. But it is chiefly with regard to the poorer population resident in the courts and alleys of towns and in the labourers'cottages of country districts, that Local Authorities are called upon to exercise vigilance, and to proffer information and advice. Common lodginghouses, and houses which are sub-let in several small holdings, always require particular attention. 48 3. Wherever there is accumulation, stink, or soakage of house refuse, or of other decaying animal or vegetable matter, the nuisance should, as promptly as possible, be abated, and precaution should be taken not to let it recur. Especially examination should be made as to the efficient working of sewers and drains, and any defect therein, and any nuisance therefrom, or from any foul ditches or ponds should be got rid of without delay. The ventilation of sewers, the ventilation and trapping of house drains, and the disconnection of cistern overflows and sink pipes from drains should be carefully seen to. The scavenging of the district, the cleanliness of the surface of the ground, and the state of receptacles for excrement and of ash-pits or dust-bins, will require close attention. In slaughter-houses, and wherever animals are kept, strict cleanliness should be enforced. 4. In the removal of filth during periods of epidemic disease, it is commonly necessary to employ chemical agents—green copperas, or chlorinated lime—for reducing or removing the offence and harm which may be involved in the disturbance of the filth. In the removal of privy contents these agents are more particularly wanted if the disease in question be Cholera or Enteric Fever. The chemical agent should be used liberally over all exposed surfaces from which tilth has been removed. Unpaved earth close to dwellings, if it be sodden with slops or filth, ought to be treated in the same way. 5. Sources of water-supply should be well examined. Water from sources which can be in any way tainted by animal or vegetable refuse, especially those into which there may be any leakage from sewers, drains, cesspools, or foul ditches ought no longer to be drunk. Above all, where the disease is Cholera, Diarrhoea, or Enteric Fever, it is essential that no impure water be drunk. The liability of leaky water-pipes to act as land drains and to receive foul matters as well as land drainage through their leaks is not to be overlooked. And such leaky pipes, running full of water with considerable velocity are liable to receive, by lateral insuction at their points 49 of leakage external matters that may be dangerous. This latter fact is not recognized so generally as it should be; and ignorance of it has probably baffled many inquiries in cases where water services have in truth been the means of spreading disease. If unfortunately, the only water that can be got should be open to suspicion of dangerous organic impurity, it ought at least to be boiled before it is used for drinking. It should not be drunk later than 24 hours after it has been boiled. Filtering of the ordinary kind cannot of itself be trusted to purify water. It cannot be too distinctly understood that dangerous qualities of water are not obviated by the addition of wine or spirits. 6. When there appears any probable relation between the distribution of disease and of milk supplies, the cleanliness of dairies, the purity of the water used in them, the health of the persons employed about them, and the health of the cows that furnish milk should always be carefully investigated. Even apart from any apprehension of milk being concerned in a particular outbreak of disease, it is desirable that English people should adopt the custom, which is always followed in some continental countries, of boiling all milk at once upon its reception into a house, unless, indeed, such milk has been previously sterilized. 7. The washing and lime-whiting of uncleanly premises, especially of such as are densely occupied, should be pressed with all practicable despatch. 8. Overcrowding should be prevented. Especially where disease has begun, the sick-room should, as far as possible, be free from persons who are not of use to the patient. Ample ventilation should be enforced. It should be seen that windows are made to open, and that they are sufficiently opened. Especially where any kind of infective fever has begun, it is essential, d 50 both for patients and for persons who are about them, that the sickroom and the sick-house be constantly traversed by streams of fresh air. 9. The cleanliest domestic habits should be enjoined. Refuse matters should be speedily removed or destroyed; and things which have to be disinfected or cleansed should always be disinfected or cleansed without delay. The influence of exposure to sunlight and fresh air in the destruction of infection should be borne in mind. 10. Special precautions of cleanliness and disinfection are necessary with regard to infective matters discharged from the bodies of the sick. Among discharges which it is proper to treat as infective are those which come in cases of Small-pox and Scarlatina from the affected skin; in cases of Cholera and Enteric Fever from the intestinal canal; in Enteric Fever also the urine; in cases of Diphtheria and Scarlatina from the nose and throat; likewise, in cases of any eruptive or other epidemic fever, the general exhalations of the sick. The caution which is necessary with regard to such matters must, of course, extend to whatever is imbued with them; care must be taken that bedding, clothing, towels, handkerchiefs, and other articles which have been in use by the sick may not become sources of mischief, either in the house to which they belong or in houses to which they are conveyed. So far as articles of this class can be replaced by rags or things of small value, it is best to use such things and burn them when they are soiled. Otherwise clothing and infected articles should be subjected to the disinfectant of the sick room before washing, or be removed for disinfection by steam heat, In Enteric Fever and Cholera the evacuations should be regarded as capable of communicating an infectious quality to any nightsoil with which they are mingled in privies drains, or cesspools; and after such disinfection of them as is practicable, they should be disposed of without delay, and under the safest conditions that local circumstances permit. They should not be thrown into any fixed 51 privy receptacle, and above all, they must never be cast where they can run or soak into sources of drinking water. 11. All reasonable care should be taken not to allow infective disease to spread by the unnecessary association of sick with healthy persons. This care is requisite, not only with regard to the sick house, but likewise with regard to schools and other establishments wherein members of many different households are accustomed to meet. 12. If disease begins in houses where the sick person cannot be properly accommodated and tended, medical advice should be taken as to the propriety of removing him to an infirmary or hospital. Every Local Authority should have in readiness a hospital for the reception of such cases. Where dangerous conditions of residence cannot be promptly remedied, it will be best that the inmates, while unattacked by disease, remove to some safer lodging. Persons who have been in association with the sick should be kept under observation for a time corresponding to the longest known period of incubation of the disease in question. 13. In the event of death taking place from an infectious disease, the body should as soon as possible be placed in a coffin with chlorinated lime or other suitable disinfectant, and should be buried (or cremated) with no longer delay than is necessary to allow the fact of death to be verified. Holding of "wakes," large funeral assem blages, and exposure of the corpse to visitors, are especially to be avoided, as is also borrowing of mourning dress for the occasion of the funeral. 14. Privation, as predisposing to disease, may require special measures of relief. d 2 52 15. In certain cases special medical arrangements are necessary. For instance, as cases of Cholera in this country sometimes begin somewhat gradually in the comparatively tractable form of what is called "Premonitory Diarrhœa," it is essential that, where Cholera has appeared, arrangements should be made for affording medical relief without delay to persons attacked, even slightly, with looseness of bowels. So, again, where Small-pox is the prevailing disease, it is essential that all unvaccinated persons (unless they previously have had Small-pox) should very promptly be vaccinated; and that re-vaccination should be performed in cases properly requiring it. 16. It is always to be desired that the people should, as far as possible, know what real precautions they can take against the disease which threatens them, what vigilance is needful with regard to its early symptoms, and what (if any) special arrangements have been made for giving medical assistance within the district. For the purpose of such information, printed hand-bills or placards may usefully be employed, and in cases where danger is great, house-tohouse visitation by discreet and competent persons may be of the utmost service, both in quieting unreasonable alarm and in leading or assisting the less educated and the destitute parts of the population to do what is needful for safety; as well as in the discovery of unreported or suspicious cases of illness. 17. The present memorandum relates to occasions of emergency. Therefore the measures suggested in it are essentially of an extemporaneous kind; and permanent provisions for securing the public health have in express terms been but little insisted on. It is to be remembered, however, that in proportion as a district is habitually well cared for by its Local Authority, the more formidable emergencies of epidemic disease are not likely to arise in it. 18. Provision by the Local Authority for disinfection by steam of bulky articles, and of those which cannot, without injury, be boiled in water or exposed to chemical agencies, ought always to be in 53 readiness. Without such provision no complete disinfection of such articles can be effected. Partial and nominal disinfection, besides being wasteful, may be mischievous, as giving rise to a false security. 19. The following system of domestic disinfection may be commended to Local Authorities who have already provided adequate public means for the disinfection and for the disposal of infected matters and things:— (a) For the purposes of the sick room such as the reception of soiled handkerchiefs, sheets, and the like, as well as for the swabbing of floors, a valuable disinfecting solution may be made with perchloride of mercury. It is well to have this solution slightly acid, coloured also in such a way that it shall not readily be confused with drinks or medicines; and proper caution should be given to avoid accidents in its use. Local Authorities will find it advantageous to have such a solution prepared and issued under the direct instructions of the Medical Officer of Health, and supplied of a uniform strength at the infected house upon the order of that officer. After being steeped in such solution and rinsed, linen and other washable articles should be washed in boiling water. * Solutions fitted for the desired purposes are:— (1) ½-oz. corrosive sublimate, 1 fluid oz. hydrochloric acid, and five grains of commercial aniline blue, in three gallons (a bucketful) of common water. It ought not to cost more than 3d. the bucketful, and should not be further diluted. The use of non-metallic vessels (wooden or earthenware house tubs or buckets) should be enjoined on those who receive it, and articles that have been soaked in it should be set to soak in common water for some hours before they go to the wash. (2) Chlorinated lime (bleaching powder) in water, of the strength of one part in 100 = 1 lb. to 10 gallons of water. (3) Formalin—a solution of formic aldehyde gas in water. This may be used diluted in the proportion of 1 part of formalin to 50 parts of water. It is more expensive than the two preceding solutions, but has the advantage of being less corrosive, and less likely to injure articles with which it comes in contact. 54 (b) In places provided with proper systems of excrement disposal, excrements of Cholera and Enteric Fever, after being treated in detail with the same disinfecting solution in ample quantity, may be safely put into the ordinary closet; but special care as to the flushing of drains and sewers, and special frequency in the removal and exchange of excrement receptacles, will commonly be wanted. Where the only closet is one that communicates with a cesspool or privy pit, the best arrangement for the disposal of infected stools, that under these improper local circumstances may be found practicable, will have to be adopted, e.g., special pails, furnished with tight-fitting lids and painted a distinguishing colour, may be furnished and collected daily by the Local Authority; their contents being then mingled with sawdust and burnt in a furnace. (c) The interiors of infected rooms should be disinfected by skilled persons acting under the directions of the Medical Officer of Health. The room should be prepared by the removal of such articles as are best disinfected by heat, and of bright metallic objects which would be tarnished; and, where gaseous disinfection is to be employed, by the closing up of all openings and crevices. The gas most frequently employed in the past for the purpose of room-disinfection has been sulphurous acid gas, obtained by burning sulphur, or liberated from cylinders in which it had been compressed for the purpose; but recent experiments tend to show that the disinfecting power of this agent has been overrated, and that chlorine gas, which may be obtained by pouring sulphuric or hydrochloric acid upon chlorinated lime, and formic aldehyde gas evolved by means of a special lamp, are more efficacious disinfectants. But, inasmuch as the infection which has 55 to be destroyed is not that in the air of the room, but that clinging as dust and dirt to the surface and recesses of walls, floor, ceiling, and furniture, the use of these gaseous disinfectants may, with advantage, be replaced by the spraying upon the surfaces to be disinfected of a liquid disinfectant such as one or other of the solutions mentioned in the note to paragraph (a). (d) After measures of disinfecting a room have been taken, the wall paper (especially if soiled, torn or loose) should be stripped from the walls and be burned, anil the room should have its ceilings and walls thoroughly washed or lime-whited. The floor and woodwork should also be well washed with soap and water. 20. For detailed information on disinfection by heat, on hospital accommodation, on Small pox, and on questions of school administration during the prevalence of infectious disease, see the Office Memoranda and Reports on these subjects. W. H. POWER, Medical Officer. Local Government Board, Medical Department, September, 1900. Directions for Obtaining and Forwarding for Bacterioscopic Examination Material from Suspected Plague Cases. [The Local Government Board, with a view to assisting in the identification of Plague newly developing in one and another district, have arranged for Bacteriological testing, without cost to the Local Authority, of material from the earliest suspected case or cases in the district. This material can he received only from the Medical Officer of Health.] 56 A.—From the Living Person. 1. Clean with soap and water and then with alcohol the last phalanx of either the second or third finger. When dry, or after mopping with a clean cloth, put a piece of tape round the proximal end of the last phalanx so as to cause venous congestion. Prick the palmar surface of this phalanx with a sterile needle, and immediately take up the exuding blood in two sterile capillary tubes such as are used for collecting vaccine lymph. These tubes when charged should be sealed at both ends. 2. When there is a discharging bubo, collect fluid therefrom in capillary tubes, as in the case of blood. When this discharge is not of a sufficiently fluid character for collection in this way, place some of it in a small glass-stoppered phial, previously well washed out with alcohol, care being taken that no alcohol remains in the phial. 3. If expectoration be obtainable, collect some in a phial in the manner prescribed in Section 2. B.—From the Dead Body. 1. Cut out any inflamed lymph gland, together with some of its surrounding tissue, and place the whole in a wide-mouthed glassstoppered bottle, previously well washed out with alcohol, care being taken that no alcohol remains in the bottle. The bottle should have the stopper well secured and sealed. 2. Obtain also a piece of the spleen, dealing with it in the same manner. All suspected plague material should be carefully packed so as to avoid risk of breakage. It is to be addressed to "The Medical Officer, Local Government Board, Whitehall, London." 57 Full particulars as to source should in each instance accompany the material forwarded. W. H. POWER. Medical Officer Local Government Board, Medical Department, September, 1900. The foregoing Memoranda are useful for administrative purposes, but it may be interesting to supplement them with a few general facts pertinent to the subject, which will render it easier to grasp the rationale of the various preventive methods recommended. Plague is not a highly-infectious disease in the sense that Smallpox, Scarlatina, and Typhoid are. There is no infection in the air of a clean, well-lighted room in which a Plague patient is lying, nor is there danger to the persons who nurse and move the patient, as long as they are careful to wash and disinfect their hands, and to disinfect the discharges from the patient and all utensils in his room. The disease is caused by a vegetable micro-organism (the Bacillus Pestis), which is so small that it would take 600 millions to cover a square inch of surface. This microbe rapidly multiplies in the viscera and blood, secreting a poison which produces the symptoms of the disease. It leaves the body by all discharges save the perspiration, hence, in filthy, overcrowded, damp, dark dwellings the clothes, utensils, or floors may become infected, and, if allowed to dry, may convey infection in the form of dust. The commonest method of infection, however, is through abrasions or wounds of the skin, and, probably also, infection may be carried by infected house vermin, such as fleas, bugs, lice, etc. The disease is epizootic, that is, communicable not only to man but also to domestic and other animals, as cats, dogs, and especially rats and mice. Indeed, frequently, extensive fatality in rats has preceded outbreaks of epidemics in man. It is essential, therefore, to wage vigorous warfare against rats, and to pay especial attention 58 to the repair of leaky drains or rat runs. Sulphurous anhydride has been found very efficacious in eradicating rats from ships, and will, doubtless, help to remove them from houses where its application is possible. Should dead rats be discovered it is unwise to remove them with the hands. They should be removed to the back yard with tongs, steeped in disinfectant, and then tarred and burned. It is from these causes that the manifestations of Plague point rather to place-infection than to direct personal contagion, though epidemics have always extended slowly along the routes of human intercourse. In olden times the commerce of the then known world was carried on by the great caravan routes between Libya, Egypt, and Syria, and it is here that the earliest exact record of Plague is recorded, about the second century b.c., though there are grounds for suggesting that the golden emerods and golden mice which accompanied the Ark on its return by the Philistines, as an offering to the God of Israel, point to an even earlier epidemic in the same region. In 542 a.d., when Constantinople, under the Emperor Justinian, was the Metropolis of the world, a widespread pandemic extended throughout the countries bordering the Eastern Mediterranean. Later, in 1340, the Black Death, attributed to the returning Crusaders, is said to have caused 25 million deaths in Europe. In 1656 the disease caused 300,000 deaths in Naples in five months, while the Great Plague of London, in 1665, was answerable for 70,000 deaths. In these days the sea is the highway of commerce, with the natural result that Plague extends from port to port. The present outbreak in South Africa, according to Professor W. J. Simpson, whose experience of Bubonic Plague in Calcutta, Bombay, and Cape Town, is probably unique, may be traced back through Hong Kong and Canton to the endemic centres of Yunnan, in China, and the danger to our own shores from the shipping centres of Portugal is a matter of common knowledge. Nothing approaching the fatal dimensions of old-world epidemics is to be feared to-day. The conditions, both of people and their 59 dwellings, is very different from those of even the last century. At the same time it is well to be prepared, and it is in the last degree important for those in authority to refrain from a spirit of scepticism with regard to the liability of their own district being attacked, and to avoid pooh-poohing any suspected case. With respect to the preventive measures advisable in the case of Plague, hospital isolation is of primary importance, and the Council has already been enabled to rest assured that the provision made by the Metropolitan Asylums Board will be open to the reception of the cases occurring in this Borough. My recommendation to utilize the row of cottages known as Ham Terrace, in West Ham Lane, for the reception of "Contacts," however, was allowed but a short shrift, and the question was referred back to me to find a site removed from busy thoroughfares. This, I fear, is impossible, unless the Council decides to acquire land and erect special buddings, a course which is quite unnecessary, for the following reasons: "Contacts" are not persons suffering from Plague, but persons to be watched during a short period; they are, therefore, entitled to have their liberty. What then is the advantage of constructing an isolated residence if the inmates are to be allowed to leave it during the day? If isolated premises be desired and Ham Terrace is to be demolished, I know of none more isolated than the four houses in Eastern Road which will remain. The situation, however, is not of paramount importance, the essential point is that the house or houses should be fixed upon and kept ready for immediate use, bearing in mind that the further removed they be the less efficient will be the supervision. In conclusion it may be well to point out the value of inoculation, which appears to have a highly-protective effect. The latest figures of which I am aware are those connected with the Cape Town outbreak, and are given by Professor Simpson as follows: "It appears that 14 persons out of 16,000 who were inoculated have been attacked with Plague, and 637 persons out of 134,000 who have not been inoculated. 60 "These calculated give the following results:— Numbers inoculated 16,000 Of these the numbers attacked have been 14 Equal .875 per 1,000 of inoculated have been attacked. The whole population 150,000 Deduct inoculated 16,000 Uninoculated 134,000 Total attacks 651 Deduct attacks among inoculated 14 Attacks among not inoculated 637 Equal 4.75 per 1,000 of not inoculated have been attacked. "If the inoculated had been attacked at the same rate as the not inoculated, the numbers would have been 76 instead of 14, which accordingly shows a ratio of reduction of about 82 per cent. The incidence on the 16,000 inoculated has been more than five times less than the incidence on the 134,000 not inoculated." 26th February, 1900.
