Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you the Annual Report on the health of Battersea for the year 1961, which follows in the main the form of previous reports. The population of the Borough, which has been gradually declining, was reduced still further in 1961 to 104,980, according to the RegistrarGeneral's mid-year estimate. This figure, which has been used in calculating the various statistical rates, shows a reduction of 2,140 on the estimated population in 1960. The preliminary results of the 1961 Census have, however, now been received, according to which the population of Battersea is 105,758. The live birth rate for the year was 19.18 per thousand of the population, an increase over the figure of 17.5 for the previous year, while the death rate was 10.87, showing a slight increase over last year's figure of 10.09. The birth rate for London was 16.8, and for England and Wales 17.4, while the death rate for London was 11.4 and for England and Wales 12.0. As in previous years the rates given are the adjusted rates arrived at after the use of the Registrar-General's comparability factor. In previous Reports no special mention has been made to the subject of illegitimacy ; this year I think a few comments would be appropriate since from time to time references are made to this social problem from the national point of view. In 1961 there were, in fact, 232 illegitimate live births out of the total 2,055 live births belonging to Battersea. In 1960 there were 192 illegitimate live births, so that there was an increase in 1961 of 40 illegitimate live births over the previous year. If this figure of 232 is taken as a percentage of the total live births, we find that in Battersea in 1961, 11.3% of all live births were illegitimate. No figures are yet available for London and the rest of the Country for 1961, but the corresponding figure for 1960 for London was 11.4%, and for England and Wales 5.4%. It is thus seen that Battersea, in common with London generally, has a comparatively high proportion of illegitimate births. This is an important social problem embracing as it does many questions such as the educational, the employment of leisure, the bonds of family life, the spiritual, the moral and other related and probably more abstruse factors. It is well recognised that a high proportion of illegitimate births is to be expected in London, and, presumably, this would apply to Battersea. For instance, there are proportionately more single women in London, with an influx of a number who may already be pregnant. The facilities which London provides for an unmarried mother to have her baby away from her own home, possibly without the knowledge of relations and friends, and in many cases, almost anonymously, are peculiar to the Metropolis. Thus, good facilities for ante-natal care and the confinement are available, and subsequently the help, support and guidance of Moral Welfare Organisations can be provided. These are some reasons why London has an attraction for an unmarried woman who has become pregnant. In Battersea, for 5 instance, there is a Home run by a voluntary organisation where some unmarried mothers can be cared for before their babies are born, where they can return with their babies, where arrangements can be made for adoption, if necessary, and for advising and helping the mother. There are similar Mother and Baby Homes in most of the London Metropolitan Boroughs. Many of the girls in these homes come, of course, from areas outside London, and excellent work is done by the staff and the moral Welfare organisations in helping the mothers, some of whom are quite young. Close contact is maintained with the Health Visitors and Children's Department of the London County Council, where necessary. These are some of the reasons why Battersea, in common with other London Boroughs, has an illegitimacy rate above the national rate. Nevertheless, although the problem in Battersea is probably less serious than it would appear from the figures, it is one that must tax the resources of Educationalists, Youth Organisations, Social Workers and the Churches, and others concerned with community well-being. If it is possible to derive any satisfaction from this subject, it is to note that contrary to what is often expected, the care which these babies receive in Battersea, is as good as, or better than, those born in wedlock receive. This is certainly the case as judged by the infant mortality rate amongst illegitimate babies, which in 1961 was only 12.93 per thousand illegitimate live births as compared with 22.49 for legitimate babies. It must be said, however, that in 1960, the illegitimate infant death rate was considerably higher. The infant mortality rate generally rose slightly in 1961 to 21.41 per thousand live births from last year's rate of 18.11. The corresponding rates for London, and England and Wales, were 21.5 and 21.4 respectively. This rate has been reduced to a comparatively low level, and yearly fluctuations are inevitable; it is the general downward trend which is important. This is seen from the rates which have been recorded over the past ten years. A very low rate of 17.6 was noted in 1952, and last year's rate of 18.11 was a reduction over the previous year. It is unlikely, however, as I outlined in my Annual Report for 1954, that the curve of reduction will resume a rapid further decline until the causes of death in the first month of life are more fully understood. I am very pleased to be able to report for the second year in succession that there were no deaths from puerperal causes in 1961. This is the first occasion that there have been no deaths from puerperal causes in Battersea over a period of two consecutive years, a " record " that reflects much credit on all concerned with the care and welfare of expectant mothers. 1961 was a year when an increase in the number of Measles cases was expected, and duly realised, there being a total of 1,906 cases of this disease as against 186 in 1960, making a total of all infectious diseases notified of 2,187 compared with 558 in 1960. With the exception of Diphtheria there was no particularly outstanding feature in relation to infectious diseases, though the number of cases of Dysentery was reduced by over half to 32 from 68. Included in the body of the Report is some account of the cases of diphtheria which occurred in the early part of the year. Although there were only three clinical cases and these fortunately, of a mild type, our investigations showed there was, in one part of the Borough, a considerable amount of infection 6 by the germ that causes this disease. Steps taken to deal with this situation were thorough, although prolonged, because it was not until some two months after we became aware of the first cases that we were satisfied that there was no more risk of diphtheria cases, or carriers, arising in the area. I take this opportunity of thanking my colleagues who took an active part in dealing with the situation. The main work fell on Dr. Plumley, who was well supported by the Public Health Inspectors, the Health Visitors and School Nurses. The teaching start of the schools concerned were most co-operative in placing facilities at our disposal for taking swabs, and I would particularly like to thank the Director of the Public Health Laboratory, Dr. A. J. H. Tomlinson, for the immense amount of work which his Laboratory undertook. Outbreaks of diphtheria have in recent years occurred in other parts of London, and in some cases the illness has proved fatal. We escape the tragedy of a child dying from this disease, but the lesson is plain. Although diphtheria is now comparatively rare, owing in large measure to the facilities for immunisation against the illness, it is important that parents should not neglect to ensure that their children are immunised and that reinforcing injections are given at appropriate intervals. I have commented in previous years on the declining number of cases of Tuberculosis, and this continued in 1961, when there were 63 cases of tuberculosis notified in Battersea as compared with 79 in 1960. In addition, 47 other cases came to our notice, making a total of 110 cases in 1961, against 123 in the previous year. On the other hand. in 1961 there was an increase in the number of deaths from this disease to 13. The figures for home accidents in 1961 do not show very marked differences from previous years. I have not hitherto referred to deaths from motor vehicle accidents, since this is not primarily a public heath problem, but it is one that cannot be disregarded. In 1961, there were, in fact, 19 deaths from motor vehicle accidents in the Borough. The Battersea Road Safety Committee is active in co-ordination with the various Organisations in the Borough which are concerned with road accident prevention. Nor have I in past years made any comment on the number of deaths from suicide, of which, in 1961, there were 16, ten men and six women, comprising 1.3% of all deaths in Battersea. This may not at first sight, appear to be a very large proportion of the total deaths. but the present is an opportune moment to comment on the situation. Prior to the passing of the Suicide Act of 1961, attempted suicide was a criminal offence, although the police rarely took proceedings, and them only when this was necessary, to ensure that the person concerned received appropriate medical treatment. This is the crux of the matter for practically all cases of suicide are in some way suffering from mental illness, and if treatment can be given to cases of potential suicide, or those who have attempted suicide, then death in this tragic way might be prevented. It is, therefore, proper to mention the Mental Health Act of 1959, which came into operation in November, 1960. This Act is not, at present, administered by the Borough Council, but by the London County Council. It is an Act which gives legislative from to present-day thinking about mental illness generally, and so far as Local Health Authorities are concerned its main provisions are directed towards the care, support and welfare of the mentally disordered in the 7 community. Already, through the London County Council's Divisional Health Committee, a strong Department has been built up locally. The treatment and the community care and support of cases of potential suicide is a small part of the work of the Community Mental Welfare Service, but, for all that important part. Cases of potential suicide present many complicated problems for the psychiatrist and the social worker, but it is hoped that as the years go by and this work comes to fruition, there will be a marked reduction in the number of cases of suicide, many of them occurring under tragic circumstances. The work of the Public Health Inspectors in supervising and improving environmental conditions in Battersea was continued through the year, and the records of the works will be found in the Tables in the Report. With regard to Slum Clearance, we were probably not quite So active in 1961 as we had been in the previous year, but the areas which were represented in 1960 were confirmed in 1961, and the work of rehousing and demolition of the houses in these areas commenced and continues. Further progress was made in 1961 in implementing the Clean Air Act. This year I include a map of the Borough showing the Smoke Control Areas already confirmed, and the areas south of the railway line which are to be " declared " in the ensuing years. The area to the north of the railway line has been deliberately not included in our detailed plans at this stage, because of the very extensive rehousing development which is proceeding in these areas. By the time that the Part of Battersea to the south of the railway has been completed it is expected that the re-development in the northern area, where all the new houses and flats will have appliances for burning smokeless fuel, will render the conversion of this part of the Borough into a Smoke Control Area a comparatively easy problem. During the year the staff at the Personal Cleansing Station was reduced, owing to the diminution of the work, so that we now have two Women bathing attendants, who are employed approximately for the equivalent of 1½ full-time persons. A glance at the Table on page 54 shows how the amount of work has varied over the years, and the marked reduction which has taken place since 1958, culminating in 1961, when only 86 adults and 305 children needed treatment. This reduction is the result of two main factors; firstly, the undoubted improvement in general standards, and, secondly, the introduction of a new method of treatment which can be carried out at home. The arrangements with the Wandsworth Borough Council and the Lambeth Borough Council, by which cases of these two Boroughs are treated at the Battersea Cleansing Station, continued. I reported last year that Dr. T. A. Plumley was appointed as Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and he duly took up his duties in March of this year. It was a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Plumley to the Department, where he soon made himself at home. He arrived at an opportune movement, for he was able to give considerable help in the outbreak of diphtheria in the early part of the year. In May, the Department said "Good-bye" to Miss J. Round, who had been a Public Health Inspector and, more latterly, an Infectious Diseases and Old People's Visitor, over a period of forty years. During this time Miss Round rendered outstanding service in the Department 8 and the Borough, and we were sorry to lose her. She left with good wishes from all of us for a long and well deserved retirement. In her place the Health Committee appointed Mrs. M. I. Richards, who took up duties in August as a Visitor for Old People, and Infectious Diseases. Mrs. Richards quickly picked up the work, and has proved a valuable member of the Department. The publication of my Annual Report provides a pleasant opportunity for thanking many people who have helped me personally, and the Department, through the year. They are too numerous to mention, but I would particularly like to thank Councillor Miss E. A. Coles, J.P" Chairman of the Health Committee, for her continued help and guidance, and all members of the Health Committee and the Housing Committee for their support. I should like, also, to thank all the staff of the Health Department, especially the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. Weeks, and all the Chief Officers and their staff for their help and co-operation during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health June, 1962. 9 Public Health in Retrospect 1861-1961 Once again I have been reading the Annual Reports written during the last century by Dr. William Connor, Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Battersea, a Sub-district of the Wandsworth Sanitary district, and the following information from his Report for the year 1861, together with some comparative figures for 1961, will, I feel sure, be of interest. At the Census in 1861 the population of Battersea was stated to be 19,582 (1961—105,758). During the year 505 deaths were registered— 265 males and 240 females (1961—2,168 deaths, 1,030 males and 1,138 females), this figure being 106 in excess of the previous year. Dr. Connor states—"This increase is attributable to the fatality of scarlet fever, whooping cough, diarrhoea, and fever. Diseases of the brain, heart, digestive, and respiratory organs, were also unusually fatal during the year under review." Of the 505 deaths, 112 occurred in the workhouse, the infirmary attached to which was the hospital for the entire Sanitary District composed of Wandsworth, Clapham, Battersea, Putney and Roehampton, and Streatham, including Tooting and Balham. Of these 112 deaths, 92 were of persons in no way connected with the parish of Battersea. Dr. Connor makes no mention of the number of Battersea residents who died outside Battersea. (Of the 2,168 deaths registered in Battersea in 1961, 1,321 were deaths of non-residents, and 380 deaths of Battersea residents were registered outside the Borough. Of the corrected figure of 1,227 Battersea deaths, 833 occurred in hospitals.) The corrected death rate for Battersea in 1861 would appear to have been about 21 per 1,000 of the population. (1961 death rate—10.87). Dr. Connor reported that the zymotic (acute infectious) diseases had been unusually prevalent during the year, and also unusually fatal, 116 deaths occurring from these diseases compared to 68 in 1860. He states -" This instance of excessive mortality from zymotic disease deserves to be recorded and remembered as a warning, and will, it is hoped, lead to the adoption of increased precautionary arrangements. Speaking of small pox, there is much reason to fear that vaccination, as is the case almost everywhere, is neglected in this parish to a deplorable extent. The indifference of parents, among the poorer classes especially, to submit their offspring to this valuable prophylactic appears to be increasing in all directions, and to call loudly for the interference of the legislature. It is indeed almost incredible that such an immense loss of life as occasionally occurs in some of the poorer districts of the metropolis and elsewhere should be incurred from the neglect of a preventive of the most simple and efficacious kind." Commenting on sickness and mortality amongst the " out-door poor" or pauper population of Battersea, Dr. Connor states that the rate of mortality than the amongst this section of the population was considerably less than the previous year. "This fact is very remarkable, and not a little encouraging, since it shows, that notwithstanding the increased mortality amongst all classes, this particular class must have benefited to a considerable extent by the sanitary improvements that have been effected within the last few years. The excess of infant 10 mortality it is clear must have been dependent upon fatal disease, etc., occurring amongst the families of a class in the receipt of fair wages, and therefore out of the pale of pauperism; and it is just this class of persons who are found most neglectful of home duties and responsibilities."

For the purpose of standardisation, the Registrar-General's area comparability factors, which make allowance for the way in which the and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, have been applied to the rates for births and deaths. The factor for births is 0.98, and for deaths 0.93. POPULATION. The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of Battersea was 104,980, which shows a decrease of 2,140 on the Previous estimated figure of 107,120 in 1960. The population of the Borough at the Census taken in April, 1961, was 105,758 (50,580 males and 55,178 females, a proportion of 100 males to 109 females). This figure shows a decrease of 11,382 (or 9.7 per cent.) on the population at the previous Census taken in April, 1951, when it was 117,140 (54,852 males and 62,288 females). The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year home population of the Borough (104,980) has been adopted for the purpose of the statistics contained in this Report. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered in the Borough during 1961 was 462 (224 males, 238 females). Of this number 9 were transferred out, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough and 1,602 registered outside the Borough were transferred in, giving on balance a total of 2,055 births (1,053 males, 1,002 females, an excess of 51 males) relating to Battersea residents, and a live birth rate of 19.18 per 1,000 population. All the Battersea births (453 live and 6 still) which occurred within the Borough were "domiciliary births." Illegitimate live births numbered 232 or 11.3 per cent. of the live births. The live birth rate for England and Wales was 17.4. Still-Births. The Registration of still-births is made compulsory by the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1926. During 1961 there were 7 still-births registered in Battersea, of which 6 were of Battersea parents. Thirty-one still-births occurring outside the Borough were registered as belonging to Battersea, making 37 in all, representing a still-birth rate of 19.93 per 1,000 births (live and still) registered. Of the 37 still-births 8 (21.6 per cent.) were registered as illegitimate. The number of Battersea still-births registered and the still-birth rate from 1952 to 1961 were as under: — No. Rate No. Rate 1952 42 23.2 1957 51 27.01 1953 38 20.9 1958 39 20.34 1954 50 28.0 1959 36 17.42 1955 32 18.1 1960 35 17.78 1956 48 26.42 1961 37 19.93 The still-birth rate in 1961 for England and Wales was 18.7. 12 MARRIAGES. The marriages registered in Battersea during 1961 numbered 935. The marriage rate (i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 of the population) was 17.8.

The number of deaths registered in the Borough during 1961 Was 2,168. Of these, 1,321 were deaths of non-residents and were transferred to the districts in which the persons ordinarily resided. There were, on the other hand, 380 deaths of Battersea residents registered outside the Borough. The total (corrected) number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 1,227 (614 males and 613 females). This gives a recorded death rate of 10.87 compared with 12.0 for England and Wales. The following table shows the age and sex distribution of the total deaths (corrected) in Battersea during 1961 : — Under 1 year 1— 5— 15— 25— 45— 65— 75+ Total M 19 8 4 6 36 193 163 185 614 F 25 1 2 2 20 101 127 335 613 Totals 44 9 6 8 56 294 290 520 1,227 % of total 3.6 0.7 0.5 0.6 4.6 24.0 23.6 42.4 100.0 Of the 1,227 Battersea deaths 833 (or 67.9 per cent.) occurred in hospitals, etc. The average age at death is shown in the following table : — Average Age at Death. 1945 62.4 1955 67.7 1946 61.4 1956 66.9 1947 62.6 1957 67.2 1948 63.3 1958 68.3 1949 65.3 1959 67.7 Mean, 1945/1949 63.0 Mean, 1955/59 67.6 1950 65.5 1951 66.7 1960 669 1952 67.7 1961 67.4 1953 68.9 1954 67.2 Males 63.7 Mean, 1950/1954 67.4 Females 71.0 13 The deaths of 810 residents of Battersea aged 65 years and upwards were registered during 1961. These 810 deaths constituted 66.0 per cent, of the total deaths at all ages. The natural increase of population (that is, excess of births over deaths) was 828 in 1961 as compared with 795 in 1960.

Infant Mortality. During 1961 the deaths of 44 infants under 1 year of age were registered as belonging to Battersea. The total number of live births registered during the year was 2,055, giving an infant mortality rate of 21.41 per 1,000 live births as compared with 18.11 in 1960 and 21.67 in 1959. The infant mortality rate in England and Wales during 1961 Was 21.4. The following table sets out the causes of death in detail. Infant Mortality, 1961.

During the year 2,187 notifications were received, which, when compared with 558 cases in 1960, shows an increase of 1,629. This increase was due entirely to the number of measles notifications received, 1,906 as compared with 186 in 1960. This large increase in measles incidence was anticipated, for, as is wellknown, this disease tends to occur in Increased prevalence every two years in London, and 1961 was a "measles year Taking this into consideration, the total number of notifications received was lower than last year, which was the lowest ever recorded in Battersea. There was an outbreak of sonnei dysentery in one of the Day Nurseries situated within the Borough affecting 20 of the children. All were excluded, and it was also necessary to exclude one of the staff from the Nursery when it was found that bacteriologically she was Positive for this disease. The illness was mild in nature, and with the exception of three cases the children were allowed to return in approximately ten days. An outbreak of diphtheria, fortunately well confined and mild in degree, occurred in the Borough early in April. There were, all told, 3 cases and 37 carriers. The cause of the outbreak was the mitis strain the corynebacterium diphtheria. The first case was confirmed on the 5th April by the Western Fever Hospital. The child attended a Junior Mixed and Infant School, and as the diagnosis was made during the school holiday a number of problems were presented in controlling the spread of the disease, especially tracking down other cases and carriers. Obviously, if all the children had been attending school, nose and throat swabs would have been relatively easy to obtain. Nevertheless, the staffs of this Department and of the London County Council Divisional Health Department were faced with the considerable task of home visits and letters to parents of over 600 children. Mass swabbings were arranged at the affected school on several occasions, and this eased the pressure of the work to a certain extent. At the same time the opportunity was taken to offer primary and reinforcing immunisation to all who needed it. I am grateful to the three Heads of the school for their ready co-operation, and also the Divisional Education Officer and his staff for all their assistance. The second case was diagnosed on the 7th April by the family doctor and removed to hospital the same day. In this instance the girl was attending the Junior Department of the affected school, and altogether seven carriers were discovered in the same class. The sister of one of these ultimately became the third case of diphtheria on the 25th May. The last carrier was admitted to hospital on the 25th May, but, in common with other outbreaks of diphtheria, 10 carriers discharged as free from infection by the hospitals subsequently showed evidence of renewed infection one week after discharge, and had to be readmitted to hospital One carrier had the misfortune to be admitted for a third time before becoming free from infection. 18 Over 4,000 swabs were taken by the Health Visitors and subsequently investigated by Dr. A. J. H. Tomlinson, Dr. J. R. Davies and the rest of the County Hall Public Health Laboratory staff, and I wish to thank the latter for their help and advice during the outbreak. I am also grateful to Dr. Ian Taylor, Epidemiologist at County Hall, for his assistance in the day to day epidemiological problems raised by the outbreak. Two cases of poliomyelitis occurred in one family during 1961Ohe, a boy aged six years, suffered some paralysis of the right arm, while his brother, aged nine years, was a non-paralytic case. Neither of these children had been immunised. There was an increase in the number of cases of infective hepatitis amongst school children in the Borough during the latter part of 1960 and the beginning of 1961. This disease is not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, or under any special Regulations, but we become aware of cases through the schools, and during 1961, 72 cases amongst school children alone were reported in this way. A modified form of exclusion of contacts from school was instituted, and the local doctors were informed of this and their co-operation obtained- Analysis of Cases (after Correction of Diagnosis) of Infectious Disease Notified during the Year 1961.

During the year 1961 there were 63 cases of tuberculosis (all forms) notified in Battersea as compared with 79 in 1960, 75 in 1959, 75 in 1958, 100 in 1957 and 108 in 1956. In addition 47 cases were reported or otherwise came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, making a total of 110 cases for the year. The case rate per 1,000 population (excluding inward transfers) Was 0.60 or 60.00 per 100,000. At the end of the year there were 1,015 Pulmonary cases and 54 non-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis on the Register. This is equal to a morbidity rate per 1,000 population of 9.67 in the case of pulmonary, and 0.51 in the case of non-pulmonary tuberculosis or 10.18 both types The tables on page 20 give details of additions and deletions of cases on the Register during the year. Deaths from Tuberculosis. During 1961 deaths from tuberculosis registered as belonging to the Borough of Battersea numbered 13, 12 of which were due to pulmonary tuberculosis. The death rates per 100,000 of the population during the 60 years ended 1960 in quinquennial averages, and for the year 1961, are given in the following table : — Years Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total 1901-1905 138.1 50.9 189.0 1906-1910 126.8 45.9 172.7 1911-1915 124.2 33.8 158.0 1916-1920 134.8 30.0 164.8 1921-1925 92.6 23.0 115.6 1926-1930 91.1 14.2 105.3 1931-1935 81.8 14.4 96.2 1936-1940 76.1 9.2 85.3 1941-1945 91.8 11.0 102.8 1946-1950 53.1 6.1 59.2 1951-1955 22.1 2.8 24.9 1956-1960 9.7 1.1 10.8 Average (60 years) 86.9 20.2 107.1 1961 11.4 1.0 12.4 The death rate per 100,000 population was 7.2 for England and Wales. 20 Tuberculosis, 1961.

Westminster Bridge, S.E.1. No charge is made to the Council for these examinations. During the year 5,446 examinations were made as follows :— Description Disease Number of Specimens Positive Results Faeces Dysentery or Food Poisoning 946 156 Throat Swabs Diphtheria 4,500 51 INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION and INOCULATION. At the request of the Ministry of Health arrangements are made for the authentication, by the Medical Officer of Health, of certificates of vaccination and inoculation issued by medical practitioners in the Borough in respect of persons going abroad. During 1961, 459 certificates were authenticated. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, Section 26. This section is concerned with the prevention of the spread of notifiable infectious diseases, and the diseases to which section 23 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, applies. It authorises a Metropolitan Borough Council, if they think fit, to compensate a person who is required by the Medical Officer of Health to cease his or her employment to prevent the spread of the disease. The Health Committee decided that compensation to be paid should be based on the merits of each case reported. Two cases were dealt with during the year. 23 Sanitary Circumstances. The following table sets out in summarised form the details of the work of the Department in relation to sanitation:— Inspections— Defects Remedied— Complaints 2,592 Drains— Rent Act 137 Repaired 73 Urinals and conveniences 340 Reconstructed 39 Caravans 194 Sealed off 130 Water certificates 66 Ventilated 53 Infectious disease cases— Cleared 131 Notifiable 319 Frontages laid 26 Non-notifiable 166 Roofs repaired 526 Drainage 3,009 Rainwater pipes and gutters renewed/repaired 187 Shops (Shops Act) 416 Rag flock premises 7 Pet shops 25 Hairdressers 143 Dampness remedied 708 Rodent control 3,757 Waste pipes renewed/ repaired 74 Other visits 5,206 Re-inspections 11,294 Water closets repaired or cleansed 138 Notices served—- Water closets installed 217 Public Health (London) Act, 1936— Intimation 947 Water cisterns cleansed or repaired 8 Statutory (Infectious Disease) 17 Water supplies reinstated 82 Statutory (Nuisance) 538 Water fittings renewed or repaired 55 L.C.C.

During the year, legal proceedings were taken by the Council in 90 cases, for the enforcement of various Acts, By-laws, Regulations, etc., administered by the Health Department. A summary is set out below:— Cases Public Health (London) Act, 1936 73 By-laws re drainage 8 Housing Act, 1957 1 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 5 Factories Act, 1937 1 National Assistance Act, 1948, and National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 2 90 Fines totalling £57 0s. 0d. were imposed in connection with these proceedings, and £38 10s. Od. costs were awarded to the Council. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions of this Act in regard to Nuisances continued to afford the main means whereby the remedy of insanitary conditions found in dwelling-houses could be secured. During the year, 947 Intimation Notices (relating to 738 premises) and 538 Statutory (Nuisance) Notices (relating to 474 premises) were served. It was found necessary to refer 156 cases to the Council's Solicitor with instructions to take steps, by legal proceedings if necessary, to enforce compliance with Statutory Notices. In 83 of these cases a warning letter from the Solicitor had the desired effect. In the remaining 73 cases, however, summonses had to be issued. As a result. Nuisance Orders were made by the Court in 23 instances. The remaining 50 summonses were ultimately withdrawn, the Notices having been complied with subsequent to the issue of the summonses. Defective conditions in 935 houses were remedied—403 by owners following the service of Intimation Notices; 519 by owners following the service of Statutory Notices, and in 13 cases action to enforce compliance with Nuisance Orders had to be taken, and the Council carried out the work in default of the persons on whom the Orders were made. In those cases, the Council were entitled to recover the cost of the works from those persons, and accounts were accordingly rendered to them. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. Section 25 of the above Act relative to choked drains was used on 57 occasions. This Section enables a notice to be served upon an owner or occupier to clear a stopped-up drain, water-closet or soil pipe, within forty-eight hours. If the notice is not complied with the Council may carry out the work and recover the cost. It was necessary for the Council to do the work on 15 occasions. 25 Section 26 enables the Council to re-instate a water supply to a dwelling after the supply has been withdrawn by the Metropolitan Water Board following a defect in the supply pipe or fittings. Notices Were served on six occasions and in each case the Council did the work in default. Authority has been given by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, and the Chief Public Health Inspector to serve Section 27 notices on behalf of the Council remedy nuisances within a specific time where unreasonable delay Would be occasioned by following the normal procedure. It was necessary to serve 16 such notices during the year, and the Council carried out the work in default of the owner on nine occasions. Dustbins. During the year, 9 notices were served under Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, concerning the Provision of dustbins, and 42 dustbins were provided, 4 being supplied by the Council in default of the owners, from whom the cost was afterwards recovered. Drainage Work. Drainage work to new premises, reconstruction of drains to existing Premises, and drainage in connection with conversion schemes, are carried out under the supervision of officers of the Department. Drains were constructed to 370 new dwellings, and 176 plans of Proposed work were deposited in connection with drainage generally. During the year, 93 drains were tested with smoke—47 of these were found to be defective. The water test was applied on 741 occasions to drains in the course of construction. 26 frontage drains (the length of drain between the house property to its connection with the sewer) were constructed or reconstructed. This work is carried out by the Council's workmen under the supervision of the Inspectors. Drainage and Watercloset By-laws made by the London County Council are enforced by the Council. In 8 instances it was necessary to request the Council's Solicitor to take legal action for non-compliance with the By-laws in connection with the failure by persons concerned to notify the Council of the work to be carried out; or work carried out which did not comply with the requirements of the By-laws. In 3 instances the By-laws were complied with before summonses were heard, but the remaining 5 cases were dealt with by the Magistrate. Fines totalling 10s. Od. were imposed. Sewerage and Sewers. The sewerage system, in common with other London Boroughs, discharges into the main London County Councils sewers, and disposal is carried out by the County Council. The Borough Council's brick and pipe sewers are regularly cleansed, and are adequate for their purpose. Occasional back-flooding is experienced in the lower part of the Borough during heavy summer storms; these conditions are receiving attention and the London County Council are reconstructing and enlarging some of their existing main sewers with a view to overcoming this problem. 26 Water Supply. The major part of the water supply in Battersea, in common with other Metropolitan Boroughs, is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board, who are responsible for its purity, and with whom close liaison is maintained. One part of the Borough, however, namely the Council's Latchmere Estate, is supplied from deep wells situated at the Latchmere Baths adjoining the Estate. Bacteriological examination of the well-water before chlorination, and prior to its supply to the Estate, is carried out at fortnightly intervals, and no significant change in its character has been noted for a period of years. During the year, officers of the Metropolitan Water Board, at our invitation, came to Battersea to discuss the water supply to the Latchmere Estate, and as a result, one or two comparatively minor improvements were introduced. In the event of a breakdown of the pumping apparatus serving the Latchmere Estate, or any other contingency, the system can be adjusted to receive water from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. All the premises in the Borough have a mains water supply, and it is not thought that any stand-pipes still exist. During the year 23 certificates under Section 95 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, were issued in respect of 370 new or re-erected dwellings. Twenty-three notices of waste of water from defective fittings, etc., observed during routine inspections of various premises, were sent to the Metropolitan Water Board. Caravans. All caravan sites in the Borough are licensed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959. After the "Appointed Day" (1st October, 1960), an offence would be committed by any person using, or knowingly allowing to be used, land for the purpose of siting a moveable dwelling unless he holds a licence granted by the Council. The conditions attaching to licences granted relate to the number of moveable dwellings which may be kept on any particular area of land ; the amount of free space between the dwellings; the provision of a water supply, sanitary conveniences, adequate paving, dustbin accommodation, fire protection arrangements and the prevention of nuisance from noise. The four sites in the Borough are regularly inspected, and during the year 194 inspections were made. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act gives power generally to the Council to require steps to be taken to eradicate infestation of rats and mice and where possible to prevent infestations occurring. These duties are carried out by Rodent Officer, assisted by two Rodent Operatives. All infestations coming to light, whether by way of complaint or otherwise, are systematically investigated, and the appropriate action taken. Where the cause of the trouble is obviously defective drains 27 or other defects in the building, the owner is called upon to effect the necessary repairs. This aspect of the work involves close co-operation between the Rodent Control Staff and the Public Health Inspectors. In the case of private dwellings the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Rodent Control Staff free of cost, and on request at business premises, where the cost is charged in full. The baiting of sewers under the control of the Council is undertaken three times during the year. Similar work is carried out by all London Boroughs, and has the result of reducing the rat population not completely, but to an irreducible minimum. The following table shows the number of premises inspected which were found to be infested with rats or mice:— Property Infested by Rats Mice Major Minor Major Minor Council's properties 15 11 Dwelling houses — 168 13 47 Business premises — 96 4 113 — 279 17 171 The total number of visits made to the above premises, and to others which were found not to be infested, was 3,757. Verminous Premises. During the year 269 premises which were found to be infested with vermin were disinfested. The insecticide used contains Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T. and gives a prolonged residual effect. Dangerous Structures. During the course of inspection for any purpose carried out by the officers of the Department, should any dangerous structure or any dangerous condition appertaining to a building be noticed, the Disstrict Surveyor of the London County Council is notified for any action he may decide to take. 53 such cases were notified. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The principal provisions of the Act relate to the registration of premises in which rag flock or other materials are used in upholstery, etc., and the licensing of premises used for the manufacture and storage of rag flock. An authorised officer of the Council has the right of entry. inspection and sampling of any filling materials. The Medical Officer of Health and Public Health Inspectors are deemed to be authorised officers. Regulations made by the Minister prescribe the standard of cleanliness for each kind if filling material, the method of testing samples, and the nature of the tests to be applied. New Regulations in this connection 28 came into operation on the 1st August, 1961, and previous Regulations made in 1951 and 1954 were cancelled. Wood wool is added to the list of prescribed materials, and the Regulations provide for a modified testing of samples. The new Regulations have been based on the 1961 edition of the standard for cleanliness of filling materials issued by the British Standards Institution. There are 4 premises in the Borough at which filling material other than rag flock are used, and these are registered. There are no premises at present dealing with rag flock. Seven visits were made to registered premises during the year, but no contravention of the Act was discovered. Rag Dealers and Sorters. Premises occupied by rag sorters in the Borough are subjected to regular inspection. During the year 86 inspections were made. Offensive Trades. There are two premises in the Borough at which the scheduled offensive trade of fat melting is carried on. The firms concerned have been established for many years, and the trades are conducted satisfactorily. Local Land Charges. Enquiries relating to Local Land Charges in connection with Notices served by the Department, information concerning the issue of Disrepair Certificates, and the way in which premises are drained, are regularly received. These enquiries require a careful search of records and drainage plans. During the year, 1,748 enquiries were dealt with. Shops Act, 1950. It is the duty of the Council to carry out the requirements of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950. Inspections are carried out with regard to the provision of ventilation to shops; the means for providing a reasonable temperature; adequate and suitable sanitary conveniences for the use of persons employed in or about a shop; adequate lighting; suitable washing facilities, and suitable facilities for the taking of meals in a shop where this is considered necessary. During the year 416 inspections were made, and 19 notices were served in connection With the provision of the required facilities. Two applications for exemption certificates in respect of sanitary conveniences were received in connection with two shops where restricted space precluded the provision on the premises of such accommodation. In each case the applicants had made arrangements for persons employed in the shops to have the use of the necessary facilities in adjacent premises, and the applications were granted. Common Lodging Houses. There are no registered common lodging houses in the Borough. 29 Housing. Provision of New Accommodation. During the year 1961 construction of the following 370 new dwellings was completed:— By the Battersea Borough Council:— Dwellings 1-79, Atkinson House, Battersea Park Estate 79 1-19, Telscombe House, Battersea Park Estate 19 1-46, Ganley Court, Winstanley Estate 46 1-72, Harling Court, Burns Road 72 1-77, Walden House, Battersea Park Estate 77 — 293 By the London County Council:— Hall of Residence (Hostel), Battersea College of Technology, Albert Bridge Road 1 1-48, Fownes Street 48 1-10, Batten Street 10 178-192, Thessaly Road 8 — 67 By Private Owners :— Ralee Court, 7, 9, Candahar Road 4 Lincoln House, 28, Sudbrooke Road 6 — 10 Total 370 Slum Clearance. During the year the Council made Compulsory Purchase Orders in respect of 12 small areas, containing 53 dwellings, in the Winstanley Road district which had been represented for slum clearance during the Previous year. Compulsory Purchase Orders in respect of the following 16 slum clearance areas, containing 259 dwellings represented as unfit, were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during 1961:- Wilditch Street Nos, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Areas. Winstanley Road Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 Areas. Weybridge Street Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Areas. Henley Street Area. The Wilditch Street Area had been represented in 1959, and the remaining Areas in 1960. Inspections made in connection with slum clearance during 1961 totalled 330. 30 Closing Orders. Under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957, 4 Closing Orders in respect of dwelling houses were made during the year; 13 underground rooms and 8 rooms in other parts of dwellings were closed under Section 18 of the Act. Court proceedings were instituted against one person in respect of the unlawful occupation of an underground room contrary to the provisions of a Closing Order. The defendant pleaded "Guilty" and was fined 10s. 0d., and £2 costs were awarded to the Council. Overcrowding. Thirteen cases of overcrowding creating offences against the provisions of Section 78 of the Housing Act, 1957, were investigated and appropriate action taken to secure the abatement of the overcrowding. Certificates of Disrepair. Rent Act, 1957. The following table shows the work carried out during the year W connection with Certificates of Disrepair:— Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) received 42 Decisions to issue Certificates of Disrepair (Form J) 41 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) 21 Undertakings received from landlords (Form K) accepted 19 Certificates of Disrepair (Form L) issued 21 Certificates of Disrepair refused 3 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair (Form M) received 25 Cancellations of Certificates of Disrepair (Form N) issued 20 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from landlords 23 Applications for Certificates re undertakings (Form O) received from tenants 1 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to landlords 23 1 Certificates re undertakings (Form P) issued to tenants 137 Inspections carried out The number of applications received for the issue, and for cancellation, of Certificates of Disrepair, and for Certificates re undertakings, showed a decrease when compared with the previous year, as did the number of Certificates of Disrepair cancelled during the year. At the end of 1961 there were still 152 Certificates of Disrepair in force. 31 Housing Accommodation Applications. All applications made to the Council are normally dealt with by the Housing Manager, who refers to me those cases in which the application is based wholly or partly on medical grounds. These cases include applications for transfer from Council tenants. He also refers certain cases in which some special feature is involved (e.g., fitness of basement rooms). During 1961 a total of 476 cases were dealt with on the grounds of ill-health or unsuitable accommodation. The maximum number of points on medical grounds other than pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated to 28 applications and 6 cases were referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration on these grounds. In 4 cases the maximum points were given for pulmonary tuberculosis, 1 of these being referred to the Housing Committee for special consideration as the accommodation was inadequate. In 23 cases of transfer applications, rehousing was recommended as essential on medical grounds. The London County Council notify cases in which the application to that Council alleges sanitary defects. The houses are inspected, and action to secure the remedy of any defects found is taken. Housing Act, 1961. Part II of this Act contains amendments to the Housing Act, 1957, and particularly in connection with houses in multiple occupation. Local Authorities are given new and strengthened powers to deal with squalid living conditions in such houses. The new powers fall into four main groups:— (1) Power to apply a code of management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed. The requirements for this code are to be prescribed in Regulations to be made. (2) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions, and also adequate means of escape from fire. (3) Power to carry out work in default. (4) Power to make a direction limiting the number of persons in a house in multiple occupation. When the Regulations are made, it will be possible to deal with multi-occupied houses very much more effectively. 32 Factories and Outworkers. Factories Act, 1937. Metropolitan Borough Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of this Act in regard to:- (i) Sanitary conveniences—Section 7—In all factories. (ii) Cleanliness, Overcrowding, Temperature, Ventilation, and Drainage of Floors—Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6—In all factories where mechanical power is not used. (iii) Certificates of Suitability for Basement Bakehouses—Section 54—In all basement bakehouses. (iv) Water Supply (where derived from a source other than the public mains)—-Section 53—In all factories.

During the year, in February and August, lists of outworkers were received from Battersea employers and from other authorities as required by the Factories Act, 1937. Some of these lists included outworkers not residing in Battersea, and these were forwarded to the appropriate authorities. The following table gives the prescribed particulars, under Part VIII of the Act, relating to outworkers. Nature of Work Section 110 Section 111 No. of out-workers in August list required by Sect. 110 (1) (c) No. of cases of default in sending lists to the Council No. of prosecutions for failure to supply lists No. of instances of work in unwholesome premises Notices served Prosecutions Wearing apparel (Making, etc., cleaning and washing) 70 — — — The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 26 - - - - - Lampshades 4 — — — — — TOTAL 100 — — — — — The total number of registered outworkers' premises in the Borough at the end of the year was 129 (including 1 contractor). The total number of inspections made was 244. The premises were found to be generally satisfactory, and it was not necessary to serve any notices or to take any other action. The following table gives details of the outworkers' premises:- Trade Premises Number on Register Workrooms Persons employed Wearing Apparel 86 90 93 Curtains 2 2 3 Keys 1 1 1 Boxes, etc. 6 8 9 Feather Fillers 1 1 1 Lamp Shades 32 35 39 Button Carding 1 1 1 129 138 147 Bakehouses. There were 12 bakehouses on the register at the end of the year, one having been closed and one added during the year. All these are classed as factories, and 10 of them use mechanical power. Twentyseven inspections were made and one notice was served. Three of the bakehouses were "basement bakehouses" within the meaning of Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937. 35 Atmospheric Pollution. Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke Control Areas. Confirmation by the Minister of Housing and Local Government of the Council's No. 2 Smoke Control Order, which had been declared by the Council in September, 1960, was received in May, 1961, the only modification being the change of the operative date from the 1st October, 1961, to the 1st December, 1961. It was later necessary to extend this date until the 1st May, 1962, residents in the Area not having been able to take advantage of the Spring months of 1961 to carry out adaptations. With the Nos. 1 and 2 Areas, approximately 287 acres are now covered by Smoke Control Orders, and this acreage will be enlarged as rapidly as possible. The officers employed in the Smoke Control Areas make house-tohouse visits to all premises, giving advice and leaving explanatory literature. When the Order is confirmed, each household receives an application form for approval of proposed works of adaptation and estimated costs, with an instruction to forward it, upon completion, to the Public Health Department. It is usual then for a further visit to be made, if necessary, concerning the work or to give any further advice, and an inspection of the completed work is made when payment of grant is applied for. During the year 2,684 visits were made; 431 applications for approval, relating to 754 conversions, were received, and grants approved amounted to £7,618. The map on page 36 gives an indication of the two Areas already declared and confirmed. It is intended to continually expand the areas of smoke control until by 1965 at least one half of the Borough will be covered by Smoke Control Orders. That part of the Borough to the north of the railway is largely in the process of redevelopment, and by 1965 a clearer picture of the requirements in connection with Smoke Control Orders will be available. The new estates constructed are in themselves free from smoke emission, and it will be necessary only to deal with the remaining private residences and industrial and other commercial premises. Smoke, etc., Nuisances and Observations. During the year, 16 complaints were made alleging nuisances from smoke, dust, grit, etc., emitted from the premises in various parts of the Borough. All these complaints received careful and sometimes prolonged investigation. A number of complaints were received in connection with one large Firm in the Borough, concerning not only smoke emission but pungent odours arising from the manufacturing processes involved. The matter has received prolonged observation and investigation by officers of the Public Health Department, and the Firm in question has carried out extensive works, both to their boiler plants and to their process, in an endeavour to eliminate the cause of nuisance. This work is continuing, and upon its completion it is hoped that no further cause for complaint will arise. In addition to dealing with specific complaints, observations are kept upon the chimneys of any industrial plant which merits observation, and the appropriate action taken. A total number of 261 observations were made. One notice was served. 37 Smoke Measuring Station. The smoke measuring station installed in the Department in 1956 continues to give valuable information concerning smoke density and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The readings are taken by members of the staff of the Department, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research receive the results and collate the information with other results obtained from Authorities all over the Country. The following graphs show the readings obtained throughout 1960 and 1961, and the "block" graph on the following page shows a comparison of the readings for the five years 1957 to 1961. 38 Smoke Measuring Station Public Health Department, Lavender Hill. Average Concentration of Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide in Microgrammes per Cubic Metre of Air. Notification of Installation of Furnaces. Notification is required under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, of the installation of any furnace with a heating capacity of 55,00 B.T.U's or more per hour. The Section does not generally apply to furnaces designed solely or mainly for use for domestic purposes. The purpose of the Section is to see that any new furnaces installed shall be, so far as is practicable, capable of being operated without emitting smoke. One such notification was received during the year. Exemption of Premises engaged in Investigation and Research. Section 21 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, provides for firms engaged in research with regard to air pollution and the efficiency of furnaces generally to apply for exemption in the event of emission of smoke above the prescribed density. One application for exemption under this Section was received, and this was granted for one year. No untoward emissions were observed. 39 Protection of Food Supply. (A)—INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES. The regular inspection of all premises where food for human consumption is sold or stored is carried out as a routine. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and regulations made thereunder, is the principal Act under which action is taken. FOOD PREMISES. As at 31st December, 1961 Milk Distributors 135 Restaurants, Cafes 145 Canteens, Kitchens 78 Butchers 63 Horseflesh (for human consumption) 1 Ice Cream (Sale) 262 Ice Cream (Manufacture) 11 Fish Shops (Wet and Fried) 39 Food Factories 20 Bakehouses (Not underground) 8 Bakehouses (Underground) 3 Preserved Food 109 Bakers 48 Greengrocers 83 Confectioners 215 Grocers and Provisions 260 Miscellaneous (Chemists, Public Houses, Off-Licences) 204 Stalls : — Grocers 4 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 60 Fish and / or Poultry 8 There are 1,067 food premises in the Borough, together with 72 food stalls. Some of the premises shown above are listed under more than one trade category. Dairies and Milk Distributors. At the end of the year there were 135 premises in the Borough whose occupiers were registered as milk distributors. The business of a dairy, wholesale dealer, whose premises were registered as dairy, was discontinued during the year. All these premises were visited during the year, and 2 notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations were served . 40 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, which came into force on the 1st October, 1960, replace and consolidate, with amendments, previous Regulations made between 1949 and 1954. The number of Dealers' (Pre-packed Milk) licences issued under the Regulations during 1961 was 135. Ice Cream Premises. Section 16 (a) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the sale, or manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice cream, or the storage of ice cream intended for sale. The number of premises registered at the end of the year was 273. Prior to registration, the premises are inspected as to suitability before recommendation to the Health Committee. The majority of applications are for the sale of pre-packed ice cream from refrigerated containers. Particular attention is paid to the 11 premises where manufacture takes place, and samples of the product are taken for examination. (See page 45). In connection with the sale of ice cream from a van, a case was reported in which three contraventions of the Food Hygiene Regulations were concerned. The contraventions comprised:— (a) The van did not show the name and address of the person n carrying on the business ; (b) the vendor had failed to provide a supply of hot and cold water; and (c) the vendor had failed to provide facilities for washing equipment. He was warned, but took no action to remedy the matters. Three summonses were issued, and the defendant was fined £20 and ordered to pay £1 in respect of offence (a), and fined £5 each in respect of (b) and (c). Butchers' Shops. There are 64 butchers' shops in the Borough. All these shops are systematically inspected, 1,824 visits having been made during the year. It was not necessary to serve any notices concerning non-compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations. One shop where horseflesh is sold for human food is included among the butchers' shops mentioned above. Fish Shops. Shops in which fish, either cooked or uncooked, is sold, or where the curing or smoking of fish is carried on, are regularly inspected. There are 39 such shops in the Borough. 128 inspections were made, but it was not necessary to serve any notices in respect of breaches of the Food Hygiene Regulations. 41 Grocers' Shops. All grocers' shops are subject to routine inspections, and following a report concerning a contravention of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, at a grocer's shop, a summons was issued against the shop-keeper for placing food on the public footway so as to involve risk of contamination contrary to Regulation 8 (a). The defendant Pleaded " Guilty ", and was fined £1 and ordered to pay £2 costs. Preserved Food Premises. Section 16 (b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, provides for the registration of premises used for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. A total of 109 premises were registered at the end of the year. In addition to butchers' and fish shops, 7 inspections of other preserved food premises were carried out. Four notices under the Food Hygiene Regulations were served. Catering Establishments. All restaurants, cafes, canteens and kitchens are regularly inspected throughout the year. There are 223 of these premises on the Register, and 760 inspections were made, 3 notices under the Food Hygiene Regulations being served. Food Stalls. All street stalls from which food for human consumption is sold are regularly inspected and, where the food sold is stored in the Borough, the storage places are also inspected. There are 72 food stalls, the majority of them being in the two street markets in Battersea High Street and Northcote Road. Legal proceedings which were taken against the owner of a mobile van from which ice cream was being sold are referred to under the heading "Ice Cream Premises" on page 40. FOOD PREMISES.

The analysis of samples of food and drugs purchased formally and informally under the Food and Drugs Act is carried out by the Public Analyst for the Borough, J. E. Woodhead, Esq., B.sc., f.r.i.C., ph.c.. at his laboratory at 325 Kennington Road, London, S.E.11. General bacteriological examination, and the examination of samples of heat-treated milk and of ice-cream, is carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. The total number of formal samples taken under the Act during 1961 was 146. In addition, 298 informal samples were procured. Of the 444 formal and informal samples procured for analysis, none were reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated. This is the first year on record during which all samples, both formal and informal, have proved to be genuine. However, one formal sample of sasausages was found to contain a lower percentage of meat than it is generally agreed they should contain. As there is no statutory requirement in this matter, action was taken by cautioning the manufacturers. The percentages of samples reported by the Public Analyst to be adulterated during the quinquennia 1921 to 1960 are given in the following table. The years 1960 and 1961 are shown separately.

Ice-Cream. Thirty-three samples of ice-cream were taken during the year, each sample being submitted to the methylene blue test. The samples were, as a result of the test, placed in the following grades:- Provisional Grade 1 20 „ „ 2 6 „ „ 3 4 „ „ 4 3 33 Where samples of ice-cream made at premises in the Borough receive unsatisfactory reports, the premises, plant, and methods of operation are examined, and, where possible, improvements are suggested. Foreign Matter in Food. There were eight instances of foreign matter in food dealt with during the year. The following six cases were, on the instruction of the Health Committee, dealt with by cautionary letters:— Piece of rope in a loaf of bread. Cigarette stub in a loaf of bread. Ball-point pen cap in a loaf of bread. Machinery grease and dirt particles in a bottle of milk. Spaghetti infested with grain weevil. Chocolate containing a maggot. a In two cases legal proceedings were taken, the first being against a wholesale dairy firm for failing to ensure that a milk bottle was in a thorough state of cleanliness before use contrary to Regulation 27 (1) of the milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. The firm pleaded "Not Guilty", but were fined £10 and ordered to pay £10 costs. The same firm were concerned in the case mentioned above of machinery grease and dirt particles in a bottle of milk which had been dealt with earlier in the year by a cautionary letter. Legal proceedings were also taken against a firm of bakers for unlawfully selling a bread roll containing dust. The defendants pleaded "Guilty" and were fined £20 and ordered to pay £5 5s. 0d. costs. 46 Unsound Food. The following table gives particulars of the unsound food which, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 180 (8), were voluntarily surrendered to the Council. Commodity Lbs. Tins Jars Pkts.

The firm concerned were prosecuted under Section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. They pleaded "Guilty", and were fined £25 and ordered to pay £3 costs. FOOD POISONING. Twelve cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, and a further two cases were otherwise ascertained. In twelve cases the causative organisms were found to be:— Salmonella agana 1 case Salmonella typhi-murium 10 cases B. coli 1 case The agents for the remaining two cases were not identified. Of the ten cases of salmonella typhi-murium, five occurred in two families. In addition to the above cases there was an outbreak of Clostridium welchi affecting 21 people who ate Christmas dinner in a staff canteen situated within the Borough. The duration of the illness varied from twelve to twenty-four hours, but the food causing the outbreak was not identified. None of these cases were notified. 47 Miscellaneous Matters. Conferences.

Many calls have been made upon the Public Health Department during the year, and it would appear that the general public are becoming more aware of the needs and problems of old age. This is to be welcomed, for the earlier we can be informed about an old person requiring help the more satisfactory the outcome, for loneliness, which is so common to many of the elderly, not only affects their physical health but also their mental processes, leading to various degrees of mental confusion and subsequent complaints from worried neighbours. A confused old person is not always easy to deal with, and if conditions deteriorate and there is a refusal to accept essential services, compulsory powers of removal may have to be taken as a last resort. Last May saw the retirement of Miss J. Round, one of the Department's women Public Health Inspectors, who had for a considerable number of year done sterling work in visiting and helping the aged. Mrs. M. I. Richards was appointed in her place as an Old People's Visitor; and started duty in August. Mrs. Richards has had past experience in old people's work, and since her appointment has been able to concentrate further on the more urgent cases which come to the notic of the Department. Her efforts, augmented by the London County Council Home Helps, the Department's laundry service for incontinent patients, the excellent Meals-on-Wheels service provided by Mrs. Rockall and her helpers in the Women's Voluntary Service, and various other voluntary services, go a long way in alleviating old people's distress and are a means of rehabilitating and stabilising their lives. Our primary object is to keep the old persons in their homes rather than admit them to Old People's Welfare Homes. The regular and specialised visiting by the London County Council Health Visitors is highly valued by the Department, and there is a continuous "to and fro" of information between the Medical Officer of Health and the Old People's Visitor on one hand, and the Health Visitors on the other. 48 At this juncture I must express my indebtedness to the Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee, by whom the Public Health Department has been helped in so many ways, ranging from grants of money towards various items to arranging for an old person to have domiciliary chiropody. We look forward to even more fruitful relationships in the future. As decline in bodily health and vigour sets in, so progressive breakdown in an old person's environment occurs, and this is seen in the room, or rooms, occupied, which becomes at first merely dirty, and eventually insanitary, and sometimes a nuisance to other people. The unpleasant task of cleansing these rooms has been carried out by volunteers from the staff of the Disinfecting Station for a nominal reward. However, towards the end of the year the Council approved more adequate financial recognition of their unique and invaluable workA further step is the decoration of such rooms, after the removal of accumulated rubbish and washing down. The Battersea Old People's Welfare Committee has kindly agreed to meet the cost of the necessary decorating materials, which will transform a dreary room into something more cheerful and pleasant. Some of the Battersea Youth Clubs have expressed their willingness to do the actual decorating, and hope to start work shortly. Thus the youth of Battersea will also be making a real and practical contribution towards assisting the less fortunate elderly folk of the Borough, and I wish to thank them for their offer of help. Removal under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Compulsory removal of an old person from his or her home, however inadequate the home may be, is an unpleasant, but fortunately rare, procedure, and much careful thought is given to such a case before definite action is taken. Happily, after kindly persuasion, the old person usually agrees to go into hospital voluntarily, but it is impossible to leave some old people in the bad conditions of their home when they are suffering from grave chronic illness and lacking any proper care and attention. Emergency action had to be taken in the cases of two old ladies during the year following the visit of a Justice of the Peace. Both, besides suffering from chronic illness, were mentally confused and living in poor conditions. One old lady, after being admitted to St. John's Hospital, was ultimately transferred to Tooting Bec Hospital. The other, unfortunately, died in hospital a short while after admission. In the many problems brought to the notice of the Public Health Department we work in the closest co-operation with the family doctor and the hospitals, but in the cases liable to compulsory removal this liaison is even more important in view of the gravity of the step to be taken. I should like again to take the opportunity of expressing the thanks of this Department to Dr. Sthyr, the Physician Superintendent of St. John's Hospital, Battersea, and his staff, for all the excellent advice and ready assistance we have received from them in our dealings with the aged. The aim of the geriatric unit is to improve the general health of the elderly and so successfully rehabilitate them that they are able to return to their homes improved in physical and mental health. There 49 they can be supported by the various local services. I should also like to thank the many family doctors who have given us much help in the more difficult cases which have been brought to our notice. We look forward to the time when compulsory removal is truly a thing of the past, and, indeed, this would not seem to be so far distant with all the recent progress in the care of the old people of the Borough. Use of Slipper Baths by Old Age Pensioners. The Council make available to old age pensioners free use of the slipper baths at their Baths Establishments (with use of a towel) on Production of their pension books. This facility has also been extended to blind persons. During the year 1961 this arrangement was taken advantage of at the respective Baths Establishments as follows:— Males Females Latchmere 3,742 2,299 Nine Elms 778 319 Plough Road 1,484 1,494 Total 6,004 4,112 Home Safety Act, 1961: Accidents in the Home. The Home Safety Act, 1961, repealed and replaced Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957. The Act empowers the Council to promote safety in the home, by publishing or making other arrangements for giving information or advice relating to the prevention of accidents in the home, and to contribute to non-profit making organisations concerned with the promotion of home safety. The following tables, compiled from reports made by the London Ambulance Service, indicate the number of accidents occurring in Battersea homes. Table I shows the number of accidents in 1961 in age groups; Table II gives the numbers from various causes each year since 1957. HOME ACCIDENTS IN BATTERSEA. Table I Year Age group (years) M. F.

Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person dying, or being found dead, in the Borough, and have power to recover from the estate of the deceased person, or from any person who, under the Act, was liable to maintain the deceased immediately prior to his death, their expenses incurred in carrying out the duty, in so far as these expenses are not covered by any grant made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. During the year, 9 cases were dealt with. The burials arranged by the Council are carried out by a local undertaker under contract, and not more than one coach is Provided for followers. The Health Department make the arrangements and collect all available information regarding any estate left by the deceased, particulars of his National Insurance, and the existence of any "liable" relatives. This information is passed to the Borough Treasurer so thet he may take steps to recover the cost. r-14-3 The total cost incurred in dealing with the 9 cases was approximately, and of this amount £50 was recovered. 51 Barbers and Hairdressers. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954—Section 18. The Council, under the provisions of the above-named Section, registers all barbers and hairdressers and their premises. At the end of the year there were 72 registered premises in the Borough, and 143 inspections were carried out. Pet Animals Act, 1951. The object of the Act is to regulate the sale of pet animals, with particular reference to their welfare whilst kept for sale in pet shops. A pet shop may not be kept except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Licences were issued in respect of 11 shops and 25 visits were made during the year. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act is chiefly concerned with the distribution by sale or otherwise of poisonous substances. The list of poisons is contained in an Order made under the Act. This Order is divided into Part I and Part II. With the poisons contained in Part I, the Council are not concerned, since an "authorised seller" is a pharmacist registered with the Pharmaceutical Society, and enforcement is entrusted to Inspectors appointed by that Society. Substances specified in Part II may be sold by "listed sellers", and these are persons who, on written application in a prescribed form, and on payment of stated fees, are recorded by the Council as "persons entitled to sell poisons in Part II of the Poisons List" at the premises recorded on the Register. The Council are required to enforce the Act the Orders so far as they relate to "listed sellers" and have appointed the Public Health Inspectors as Inspectors under the Act. At the end of the year there were 80 persons registered under the Act. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952. Regulations under the above Act prescribe that heating appliances suitable for use in a dwelling house or other residential premises shall be fitted with a robustly made guard securely attached to the appliance, and shall satisfy certain other tests set out in a Schedule to the Regulations. It has been found, since the passing of the Act, that almost without exception appliances on sale are sold to a British Standard specification, which gives the double assurance of their being subject ti inspection at the place of manufacture. Occasional cases of second-hand appliances of an old type being offered for sale may occur, however, and a constant watch is kept for such appliances. One such case was reported during the year, and, on the instructions of the Health Committee, legal proceedings were taken against the vendor. He pleaded "guilty", and was fined £2. This Act has now been repealed by the Consumer Protection Act, 1961. 52 Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960. This Act came into effect on the 1st January, 1961, and under it Regulations were to be made requiring oil heaters to comply with specified standards of safety. Provision is made for the prohibition ot the sale of oil heaters or component parts which do not comply with the regulations, and for inspection and testing. The Act has now been repealed by the Consumer Protection Act. 1961. The Consumer Protection Act, 1961. The Consumer Protection Act, 1961, came into operation on the 19th August, 1961, and enables the Secretary of State to make Regulations in respect of any prescribed class of goods, as to composition or content, design, construction, finish or packing, to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury, and to secure that goods of these classes are marked in a manner prescribed, with any necessary warning or instruction. The duties as regards inspections and prosecutions are laid on the Council by the Schedule to the Act, which also repeals the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, and the Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960. Noise Abatement Act, 1960. The Act provides that noise or vibration which is a nuisance shall be a Statutory Nuisance for the purposes of Part III of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and amends Section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1936—which already dealt with certain nuisances of this character within the Metropolitan area, by substituting for the words "excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which is injurious to health" the words "noise which is a nuisance", and extends the application of the Section to vibration nuisances. The Act does not contain any reference to standards or measurement of noises which would constitute a nuisance, but leaves it in the very broadest terms, and thereby permits varying opinions of what does or does not constitute an actionable nuisance. It does, however, contain a clause prohibiting the operation of a loudspeaker in a street between the hours of nine in the evening and eight in the morning, and restricts the use of a loudspeaker in the highway for purposes of advertising, trade or business at any other time. The Act does not extend to noise or vibration caused by aircraft. In its application to London there is a minor change of the proviso to subsection (1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937, by which references in this Metropolitan Act to action by "three persons being either householders or occupiers of premises within hearing of the noise nuisance" is replaced by "three persons each of whom is the occupier of land or premises, and is in that capacity aggrieved by the nuisance". The rigid application of the Act suffers by the lack of any generally accepted standard, and in the four complaints which have been dealt with in this year it has been found that persuasion of the offender has been more practicable than direct official action, and the aim has been to lessen, or remove where possible, offending noises which have been the subject of complaint. 53 Public Swimming Baths. The Council maintain four public swimming pools—three at Latchmere Baths and one at Nine Elms Baths. The source of water supply at the Latchmere Baths is from deep wells. In the event of breakdown or any temporary cessation of supply from the wells, the water is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. The Nine Elms Baths are supplied from the Board's mains. The Bath water is effectively chlorinated, and there is a tunover or change of water in the Baths approximately every 3½ hours. Samples of water from the swimming pools are taken at fortnightly intervals and submitted for bacteriological examination. The results have been consistently satisfactory. Public Lavatory Accommodation. Five public conveniences for both sexes and one for females only are provided by the Council in various parts of the Borough, two being underground. All the lavatory accommodation at each of the conveniences is provided free, and, in the interests of public health, free washing facilities are also available. One public urinal is maintained, and in addition the urinals attached to eight licensed premises are, by arrangement with the owners, available to the general public. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Methods of Disinfection: Following the notification of a case of infectious disease requiring disinfection, an inspection is made and the following methods used. The patient's room is sprayed with a formaldehyde solution. The doors and windows are closed and the room can be used again after five or six hours. Advice is also given to the occupier that a thorough "spring cleaning" of the room is a very effective "disinfection" process, and should be carried out in addition to the work of disinfection by the Council's staff. Bedding and clothing are collected and steam-treated at the Station, where the disinfection plant consists of two large steam disinfectors. Sheets, pillow cases and hand towels are exposed to formalin vapour in a special chamber prior to being washed in the adjoining laundry. Books and other articles which cannot be steam disinfected are also treated by exposure to a formalin vapour. Disinfestation of Verminous Rooms : Articles in the room requiring treatment are removed for steam disinfestation. The room is sprayed with an insecticide containing Pybuthrin and Lindane/D.D.T., which gives a prolonged residual effect. In the case of a heavy infestation, architraves and mouldings are required to be eased for deeper pene- tration of the insecticide. Control of Insect Pests: The construction by the Council of large block of flats containing covered ducts taking hot water, plumbing and drainage pipes has raised a problem of insect infestation. These ducts form an ideal harbourage for insects which would be difficult to been with by normal hand spraying. A Microsol Mist Generator has been purchased by the Council, and this fitting, having a small motor unit, is capable of spraying a fine mist or fog of insecticide to a distance of 50 feet, the mist settling out on to the surfaces of the duct and the piping contained therein. This fitting is in use and is proving very successful. 54 Complaint has also arisen through infestation by the Clover Mite (Bryobia praetiosa) of Council premises, particularly new blocks flats. The mite is brought in on turves in grassing the areas adjoining the blocks. It is red in colour and harmless, but a source of annoyance to the occupants. It has been controlled by the use of an acaricide applied in the form of a "wettable" powder based on "Malathion" as one of the active ingredients. Personal Cleansing Station. There are facilities for treatment of scabies and verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, Sheepcote Lane. During the year 146 treatments were given to persons suffering from or contacts of scabies—47 to adults, 84 to school children, and 15 to children under school age. In addition to the above 39 adults and 206 children found to be verminous were cleansed. Of the 206 children, 190 attended from local schools by arrangement with the London County Council, who have entered into a contract with the Council for the use of the Personal Cleansing Station. The cleansing and treatment of the school children is carried out under the supervision of officers of the London County Council, while the disinfestation of clothing and, if necessary, of the home is carried out by the Borough Council's staff. The following table shows the number of treatments at the Personal Cleansing Station and the expenditure incurred since 1950:- Year Adults Children *Expenditure *Amount Contributed Verminous and Scabies Verminous and Scabies £ £ 1950 226 2,238 1,750 410 1951 200 1,858 1,992 406 1952 176 1,994 1,956 535 1953 144 1,943 1,932 508 1954 214 2,499 1,966 512 1955 246 2,318 2,371 526 1956 262 1,517 2,681 547 1957 289 1,535 3,202 553 1958 288 1,756 2,536 560 1959 221 1,259 2,259 560 1960 142 640 2,529 545 1961 86 305 2,280 540 * Financial year ending 31st March. Other columns, calendar year. It will be seen that the decrease in the numbers of adults and children treated which occurred in 1959 and 1960 was continued in 1961. The contract with the London County Council, referred to above, provides for the payment by them of 3s. 6d. for each treatment given, whether for vermin or for scabies, with a minimum payment of £500 per annum. 55 Arrangements have been made with the Wandsworth Borough Council, and the Lambeth Borough Council, for certain of the residents in those Boroughs, who require treatment or cleansing, to attend at the Battersea Personal Cleansing Station, the cost of this service being borne by the respective Boroughs in which the patients are resident. During the year 57 treatments were given to Wandsworth residents and 13 treatments to Lambeth residents. Methods of Treatment:— Scabies: Persons attending for treatment are given a hot bath for twenty to thirty minutes, thoroughly dried, and Benzyl Benzoate applied to the whole of the body. This is repeated on alternate days, there being three treatments in all. Verminous heads: The hair is treated with a preparation containing cotton-seed oil, tar oil, paraffin oil and oil of lemon grass, and then washed with a shampoo of soft soap and borax. It is then dried thoroughly, combed with a Sacker's comb to remove nits, washed, bried and combed again. The operation takes approximately half an hour for each child, and a final check is made by the Sister in attendance.
