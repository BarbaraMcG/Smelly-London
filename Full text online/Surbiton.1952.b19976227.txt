ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952. Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas, Surbiton. July 1953 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, The thirty first Annual Report dealing with health matters of Surbiton is being presented. The usual procedure laid down by the Ministry is adopted and vital statistics are based on the figures given by the Registrar General. The population of Surbiton has risen to 61,590. During the winter of 1952 Surbiton, in common with other localities round London, was blanketed by a very dense yellow fog causing an increase in deaths of respiratory and cardiac cases vide page four. The infantile mortality rate was reduced from 20.21 to 18.42, and when compared with that for England and Wales is very satisfactory The births amounted to eight hundred and fourteen and the number of deaths occurring was six hundred and five giving a natural increase of two hundred and nine. During the year in question twenty four pads for the analysis and examination of the Hogsmill Stream were taken and unfortunately eight showed the presence of 'Salmonella Paratyphoid which caused considerable concern. Notice boards were erected stating "Unfit for bathing and paddling". The effluent (one) showed presence of Salmonella Paratypho??? and it is high time that the Sewage Disposal Works of the districts in the Hogsmill catchment area were improved as, in ray opinion, the street is potentially dangerous, although no outbreaks of Paratyphoid or Enteric Fever have been recorded, at any rote, in Surbiton.

The Housing Act, 1949, introduced a scheme to encourage property owners to modernise existing houses "which though soundly. construc ted and In good general repair, lack the amenities and conveniences which have come to be regarded as essential to a decent and healthy life", by providing financial assistance for works of improvement. The Council continued to operate this- scheme in cases where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, where additional bedroom accommodation was to be provided, and where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. Five applications for such grants.were received during the year. Three grants were recommended by the Council and the other two were not approved.by them. In one recommended case the Ministry of Housing and Local Government rejected the application, and In another case amended the amount approved by the Council. Grants actually made were as follows:- £85. 5. 0. To provide hot water system, bath, internal V.C. and larder. 20. £81. 7.6 To provide hot water system, bath, Internal W.C. and larder. Rather surprisingly the number of enquiries about this scheme has been very small indeed, and at the end of 1952 only eight grants had been made. I should like to re-iterate the comment which I made in my 1950 Report that it is an unhappy fact that despite the splendid achievements of the past 30 years in slumclearance and re-conditioning of houses, the time has not been found opportune to make compulsory the provision of a fixed bath and hot water supply before a house can be regarded as in all respects fit for habitation. Even today there are hundred of houses in this Borough lacking such facilities. FOOD PREMISES. Thirty-nine premises are registered under Section 14 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1938, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale. 1,439 visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public-houses, and food-handling businesses and vehicles of all descriptions to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food stuffs of all kinds. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Council under the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation. Hot water supply provided 20 New washbasins provided 2 Soap and towel provided 1 Internal walls and ceilings repaired 4 W.Cs. cleanscd or repaired 1 Food storage improved 3 Delivery vans repaired, cleansed, etc. 4 lards cleansed 2 Prevention of food from contamination 8 Food premises reconstructed 1 Food premises cleansed 94 Cold stores repaired 4 Floor covering renewed 2 Name and address inscribed on vehicle 1 Miscellaneous 3 FOOD INSPECTION The following foodstuffs found to be unfit for human Consumption were surrendered by the owners, and either salvaged ■ w animal feeding or destroyed •- A2iicle_ No. of lbs. ozs.

No disclosure that the sausages contained preservative had been made on sale. It was ascertained that the butcher from whom the sample was procured had purchased the sausages from a wholesaler in London and the wholesaler had failed to indicate the presence of preservatives. A warning was given to the wholesaler in this case. 1205 (formal)Milk,hot Contained 19$ added water. Proceedings taken under section 3 of the Pood & Drugs Act, 1938. A fine of £15. was Imposed and the Council awarded £3.3.0. costs. Tile ingredients specified on the label Powder included "wheat amylum" and"processed farina" which do not constitute appropriate designations for the purpose of the Labelling of Food Order, 1950. It was ascertained that a neighbouring Authority was already in communication with the Ministry of Food with regard to this incorrect labelling and the matter was therefore left in their hands. 25. 1234 (formal) Contained only of milk solids Ice Cream. other than fat Instead of a minimum of Warning letter sent to manufacturer s. 1270 (informal) Contained only 80.8 per cent of sugar Jelly Crystals instead of a minimum of 84 per cent. After consultation with the Public Analyst it was decided to take a further informal sample. 1274 (informal) Contained only 82.0 per cent of Jelly Crystals sugar instead of a minimum of 84 per cent as required by the Food Standards (Table Jellies) Order, 1949. This was a follow-up of sample No.1270. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers who withdrew existing stock from sale. A subsequent sample was satisfactory. There were in addition two prosecutions as follows- (i) For selling to the prejudice of the purchaser a cake containing a screw. A fine of £2. was imposed and the Council awarded £2.2.0. costs. (ii) For selling to the prejudice of the purchaser a cake containing a portion of wire nail. A fine of £5. was imposed and the Council awarded £5. costs. ICE CREAM. Premises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 14, Food & Drugs Act, 1938, as under - For manufacture, storage and sale 10 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 16 For storage and sale, but not manufacture 102 During the year 252 visits were made to premises and vehicles and 174 samples of ice-cream were taken for laboratory examination for bacterial cleanliness, details being as follows:- Ice Cream. Grade I Coliforms absent 90 ) ) " Coliforms present . 11 ) ) ) 77% II Coliforms absent 15 ) " Coliforms present 10 ) " III Coliforms absent 9 ) 12% Coliforms present 11 ) " IV Coliforms absent 5 ) 11% " Coliforms present 13 ) Iced Lollies Grade I Coliforms absent 10 Total:- 174 26. In no case was Faecal Coli found. The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that it is unwise to pay too much attention to the result of any one sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that it would be reasonable to expect about 50 per cent of samples throughout the year to fall into Grade I, 80 per cent into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. The eighteen Grade IV reports which spoil our record were from two sources of supply which, being unsatisfactory, were repeatedly sampled with varying results. One of these supplies was eventually discontinued. Very little ice cream is now made in this district and of the 174 samples only 14 (6 being lollies) were of local manufacture. Each retailer from whom a sample was taken was supplied with a copy of the laboratory report, and a Sanitary Inspector visited the premises and gave advice where reports were not up to the standard expected. Where manufacture took place outside the Borough copies of reports whether good or otherwise were also sent to the Sanitary inspector for the district concerned for his information The Food Standards (Ice Cream) (Amendment) Order, 1952, came into operation on 7th July, 1952, and reduced the minimum fat content of ordinary ice cream from 5% to 4% and the minimum non-fat milk solids from 7½%to 5%. ' Sugar remained unchanged at 10%. There were similar alterations for ice-cream containing fruit and for Kosher ice. Seven samples were taken to see that the proper standard was reached and six wore found in order. The seventh was deficient in non-fatty solids and a warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. MILK SUPPLY. (i) At the end of the year there were twenty-nine entries on the register as follows Distributors of milk residing in the Borough 14 Distributors of milk residing outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 6 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 9 (ii) Mi1k_(Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations,1949. Milk (Special PesignationT Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows Pastenrised milk 12 Pasteurised milk (supplementary) 8 Tuberculin tested milk 10 Tuberculin tested milk (supplementary) 8 Sterilised milk 9 Sterilised milk (supplementary) 8 27. (iii) 143 samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests Phosphatase Test Methylene Blue Test Turbidity T.B.

Only five samples failed to pass the prescribed test. ( a) T.T.Fasteurised . One sample failed the methylene blue test probably on account of the prevailing hot weather. (b) T.T(Farm Bottled). One sample failed the methylene blue test. It was taken during hot weather and part of its journey took place in an uncovered vehicle. The matter was taken up with the firm concerned who stated that they were replacing their. fleet with covered vehicles and the change-over was to be completed by the Summer of 1953. (c) Pasteurised. Three samples taken on the same day failed the phosphatase test. These were the first failures ever recorded here against the Dairy Company involved. No satisfactory explanation of the failure was found. Subsequent samples were satisfactory. DYSENTERY AND FOOD POISONING. The number of specimens collected and taken to the Laboratory for bacteriological examination In the course of investigating these illnesses was as follows:- Faeces Suspected food 1950 1202 13 1951 694 2 1952 183 15 DUSTBINS. Forty-four dustbins were provided as a result of notices served, two such notices being statutory and the remainder informal. The Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins was continued, sixty-four bins being sold during the year. 28. Factories and bakehouses. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 253 (215 mechanical, 34 non-mechanical and 4 works of building construction). Three hundred and ninety-two visits were made to these premises, and works were carried out to remedy contraventions found as under Want of cleanliness 1 factory Insufficient sanitary conveniences 4 factories Defective, dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences 21 factories Means of escape in case of fire not in order 3 factories Other offences 7 factories f ive certificates were issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factories to which they' related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may be reasonably required in the circumstances. There were 83 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. Seventy visits were made but no contraventions found. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Thirty-eight licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twenty-four of the caravans are- standing on the-Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. Difficulty was experienced with three caravans which were brought on to land within an area covered by a Prohibitory Order made under the Surrey County Council Acts. Eventually one of the caravans was removed and the use of the other two for human habitation was discontinued. Two other infringing caravans were removed. There is one other site in the Borough on which some unlicensed caravans are parked which is receiving consideration. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act which is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals" came into force on 1st April, 1952. The Council after care'ful consideration drew up a set of conditions to be imposed in licences authorising persons to keep pet shops. Licences in respect of three such premises were issued during the year. 29. SHOPS ACT, 1950. Two hundred and thirty six visits were made in the administration of this Act, and twenty-three infringements were corrected. Despite its consolidation into one Act the law relating to shops is a complicated piece of legislation not altogether in keeping with the times. The proposals of the government for amending legislation following the report of the Gowers Committee are awaited with interest. DISINFECTION (a) During the year disinfection was carried out at sixty premises in which the following diseases occurred Anterior Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 11 Suspected Diphtheria 1 Meningo-coccal infection 2 Measles 1 Scarlet Fever 28 Tuberculosis 16 Miscellaneous 1 Disinfection was also carried out at thirty-five other premises on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed- was:- Disinfected Destroyed. Blankets 62 3 Bolsters 9 5 Counterpanes 9 2 Curtains 3 - Cushions 9 - Featherbeds 7 — Mattresses 26 4 Mattress covers 5 - Pillows 74 5 Pillow cases 37 - Rugs 4 - Sheets 23 1 Towels 6 — Wearing apparel 13 — Bedspreads 5 - Miscellaneous 11 5 303 25 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 106 No. of library books disinfected 224 1000 sacks to hold fertilizer for export were disinfected with formalin at the Sewage Disposal Works. 30.

At the request of the County Council seven school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General. Advice is frequently sought from the Department in the identification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be much apnreciated. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE *>CT,1948. One burial was 'effected in accordance with Section 50 of the Act where it appeared that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body we_,e being made otherwise than by the Counc il. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year seventy-two bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. 31. RATS AND MICS DESTRUCTION. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred "by the Council in carrying out its functions under the Prevention of Damage by pests Act, 1949. Grant-aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial premises, and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers or, in certain circumstances, the owners. 58 business or industrial premises, schools, etc. were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. Whilst it is the duty of occupiers of houses to keep their premises free from rats and mice, the Council continued to carry out treatment of infestations at private dwellings without charge provided the occupiers took such steps as might from time to time be-necessary and reasonably practicable for preventing their premises from becoming infested. This decision has considerably facilitated the work at orivate houses as treatment is able to proceed almost immediately an infestation is found. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year, and suggest that we are keeping the rodent population to a very low level. 32. 1. vists (a) Surveys DwelTTnga business Premises Property Totals ( Total number of visits Re. complaints 412 70 10 — 492 Under Prevention of Damage by ... ..

CONCLUSION. This report shews another year of steady progress in the many branches of our duties with no spectacular items calling for special mention. In my last two reports I have referred to the difficulties of landlords In maintaining their houses in a good state of repair in the prevailing economic circumstances. These conditions have unfortunately worsened with the continued rise in the cost of building works, and the duty of administering the law by compelling owners to carry out necessary repairs is becoming more and more difficult. We have done our utmost to ease the burden by only asking for absolutely essential repairs and by allowing the longest reasonable time for execution of works. This has involved a good deal of negotiation with owners who have, on the whole, responded well to our requests. Statutory action was not resorted to- till persuasive methods completely failed. In only two Instances was It necessary for the Council to carry out works In default whilst in another two cases works of repair were not executed until a Nuisance Order had been made by the Magistrates. If building costs continue to rise and the Rent Restrictions Acts remain unchanged it seems obvious that the time will come when the repairs section of the Housing Act will become inoperable because it will often be impossible to make houses fit for habitation at "reasonable cost". I earnestly hope that such a situation will not be allowed to develop because it would inevitably mean that many properties with a potential life of some years would be allowed to deteriorate so that they would soon qualify for demolition and be lost as • housing units. It is a great pity that the improvement grant scheme introduced in the Housing Act, 1949, has proved so unattractive to private property ownerq. Had the scheme proved successful not only would it have prolonged the life of many "middle-aged" houses but it would have made them more comfortable and convenient for the occupiers. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H, J. ELDRIDGE, Senior Sanitary Inspector. I have to thank the Chief Officers of the Corporation for their co-operation, also Mr Eldridge and the staff of my Department for their help and assistance throughout the year. NEVILLE H.
