To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the annual report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1957, together with the report of your Public Analyst T. McLachlan, Esq , A. C. G. F. C., P.R. I.C. Statistics The statistics indicate the continuance of a state of good health and conditions in Fulham. There is a rise in the birth rate for the year, i e 15 39 compared with 14 82 in 1956, the natural increase of population being 505. The death rate (11 04) is lower than the 1956 figure (11,31). Diseases of the heart and cardio-vascular system account for the highest number of deaths, viz. 376. Deaths from all forms of cancer show a considerable decrease, 236 compared to 269 in 1956. Deaths due to accidents (excluding motor accidents) and suicides were 42 compared to 46 in the previous year. There is a slight rise in the tuberculosis death rate compared with last year (19 8 this year 18 8 last year). I regret to report one maternal death during the year giving a rate of 55 per 100, 000. The Registrar General s estimate of the mid year population of Fulham was 116 200 - a decrease of 900 in the estimated figure for 1956 i. e. 117,100 It is interesting to note that this fall in population coincides with an increase of 3 252 separate dwellings in the Borough. Any tendency which denotes a greater spread of population in so far as it reduces overcrowding is most welcome from a health point of view Infectious Diseases With the exception of the periodic increase of measles notifications which were 1,531 for the year, I am pleased to report a low incidence of infection generally. There was no outbreak of serious infection Apart from the deaths from tuberculosis, only one other death occurred from infection and this was due to a meningococcal infection There was no case of either diphtheria or typhoid Sonne dysentery was mild and somewhat intractable There were six confirmed cases of poliomyelitis. The number of food poisoning notifications was 18 This figure does not give a true indication of the incidence of the disease which is greater than the number of notifications would convey. 5 Clean Air Act Your Council took prompt action under this Act with special reference to Smoke Control Areas and the Borough's first Smoke Control Area will come into operation on the 1st October, 1958 A full report on this is given in the body of my report but as the Ministry of Housing and Local Government's Memorandum on Smoke Control Areas so well says:- "The establishment of smoke control areas will necessarily be gradual it will need to be undertaken in stages, over a period of years in the larger towns Progress will be governed by the supply of smokeless fuels the rate at which appliances can be converted or replaced and the rate at which local authorities are able to formulate and carry through their smoke control plans. Above all, progress:- and indeed the whole success of the operation will depend upon public support: upon people5 s understanding of the problems involved, and their readiness to co-operate in smoke control measures " Food Hygiene The year 1957 was the first complete year of working of the provisions of the Pood Hygiene Regulations and there is evidence of the general improved conditions of food handlers, of standards of premises and of equipment Much has been done and much remains to be done The Rent Act The year saw the coming into operation of the Rent Act, a highly controversial measure and also of the Housing Act, 1957. Care of the Elderly This work which is co ordinated by the Old People's Welfare Committee and Voluntary Associations is constantly expanding and extending its scope. Loneliness is still one of the big problems of old age. The increased numbers of Luncheon Clubs has contributed to the well being of those who attend regularly There is the closest co operation between the voluntary agencies the local medical practitioners and the Public Health Department in relation to the medical and social needs of the elderly and I would take this opportunity of thanking the Fulham medical practitioners and the voluntary agencies for the splendid co-operation they have given Personal services Information regarding the London County Council Services has been kindly supplied by Dr B E A Sharpe the Divisional Medical Officer and I am indebted to Dr. F. A. Nash Medical Director of the South West Mass X Ray Service for his report on the Mass Radiography Unit and to Dr H C Price Chest Physician, Fulham Chest Clinic, for permission to quote from his Annual Report I should like to place on record the continuing cordial relationships regarding these services Disinfestation Unit The creation of a small Disinfestation Unit has made it more convenient and expedited treatment for those who require this service. 6 It is with regret that I record the death in December, 1957 of Mr. J. H. Hughes, Disinfecting Superintendent, a valued and efficient officer of the Council who, in his own inimitable way, won the respect and friendship of all the public for the work he did amongst them and also that of his colleagues. He is greatly missed. Public Health Inspectors Like other Boroughs in London, we are still not up to establishment in the Public Health inspectorate. The pattern of the Public Health Inspector's work is changing in some aspects, e.g. compared with 1938 there has been a very big decrease in the number of Intimation Notices served (with the exception of the rise in the immediate post war years), as the following table shows:- Year Notices Year Notices Year Notices Year Notices 1938 2,020 1943 1,758 1948 4,205 1953 2,470 1939 1,684 1944 1,329 1949 4,780 1954 1,775 1940 1,240 1945 2,815 1950 4,058 1955 1,693 1941 887 1946 3,870 1951 3,667 1956 1,554 1942 946 1947 4,551 1952 2,604 1957 1,115 Since the scheme for training Public Health Inspectors commenced, three have qualified and three are now in training. I should like to take this opportunity of conveying my thanks to members of the Council for the help given and interest shown at all times and especially to the Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the Public Health and Staff Committees for their encouragement and consideration in dealing with all public health problems Finally, I am indebted to my fellow Chief Officers and the members of their departments for all the co operation and help given, and to my Deputy Dr. C. A. Meade, and the staff and employees of the Public Health Department (The Public Health Team!) I should like to convey my appreciation of the loyal and efficient way they have each carried out their duties to make the year's work and this report possible. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health 7 Section A General and Vital Statistics Page Physical Features of Borough 8 Population and Area 8 Rateable Value and Product of ld.

Its other boundaries are formed by the Boroughs of Hammersmith in the west, Chelsea in the east, and the Royal Borough of Kensington in the north. It is very flat and low lying being only 12-13 ft. above sea level. The subsoil is of flood plain gravel overlying London clay 20 to 40 ft. below. Subsoil water is rarely met within 15 ft of the ground surface. Fulham is principally a dormitory Borough with a fringe of heavy industrial undertakings on the riverside, and is well served with open spaces and parks which have been added to by post war development. The slum clearance and redevelopment programmes are also having the dual effect of improving the standard of housing and the appearance of the Borough. Population (estimated mid 1957) 116,200 Area of Borough 1,706 acres Separate Dwellings (estimated at April 1957) 33,605 Rateable Value £1,849,074.

Routine investigations were carried out in sixteen cases and in six cases Salmonella Typhi-murium was isolated from specimens submitted for bacteriological examination. In the remaining two cases onset occurred in hospital and were also due to Salmonella Typhi-murium. 14 Dysentery There were 35 cases notified in the first quarter of the year but the number fell considerably during the following two quarters, rising again in the last three months particularly in December when 33 cases were notified. This sudden increase was due to an infection in a Day Nursery where 36 children and three members of the staff were found to be suffering from Sonne Dysentery.

On 3rd July further information was received from another authority that a doctor who was a pathologist at the hospital where the smallpox cases were diagnosed, had been admitted to hospital as a suspected case of smallpox. Investigations had revealed that two Fulham residents had visited this doctor's home on 29th June and also that the doctor himself had attended a party in Fulham on 30th June. The couple who visited the doctor were immediately contacted and arrangements made for their vaccination and surveillance; the householders who gave the party were interviewed and details of all the persons attending the party were obtained. As a consequence ten Fulham residents were vaccinated and a further five persons were referred to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which they lived with the minimum of delay. Notification was received on 9th July that it had been established that the doctor was not a case of smallpox and therefore all concerned were informed and routine surveillance ended. 15 Exclusion from work of Contacts of Infectious Disease Both by regulations made under the National Insurance Act, 1946, and the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1953, persons may be excluded from work and entitled to National Health sickness benefit if, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, such persons are contacts or carriers of disease and it is necessary to exclude them from work in order to prevent the spread of infection These Regulations apply particularly to food handlers in foodshops; also cooks and kitchen hands employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants.

The Notification Rate has decreased from 121.3 in 1956 to 106.7 in 1957. 16 SCABIES AND ALLIED CONDITIONS NEW TREATMENT CENTRE DISINFECTING STATION, TOWNMEAD ROAD For many years this Council have had an arrangement with the Kensington Borough Council for them to give medicinal baths to Fulham adults and children under five. These baths, for scabies and vermin, were carried out at the Kensington Centre, Blechynden Mews, W.11. The journey to the Kensington Centre was a most awkward one for Fulham residents and normally involved public transport of train and bus Bearing in mind the reason for the treatments being required, this was most undesirable and the Council, therefore, agreed to provide a treatment centre at the Disinfecting Station. This was done by the Borough Architect's Department, who altered the existing staff bath and changing room, so that it could be used for men, and adapted a small brick hut in a similar fashion for women and children. A new bathroom for the staff was also constructed. At the same time the opportunity was taken to make a separate office for the Disinfecting Superintendent. The Centre is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1.30 to 4.30 p.m. During the time of bathing the clothing is heat treated and is ready to wear afterwards. The work of bathing the men is undertaken by the existing staff under the supervision of the Superintendent, but the bathing of women and children necessitated the appointment of a female bathing attendant for eight hours per week. The general practitioners and all other interested persons were circulated and made aware of the new centre by being given cards which they give to their patients requiring treatment. The cards give details of the location of the centre and the hours of operation. The practitioners are notified after treatment has been carried out. The new system has worked excellently with no difficulties. Number of treatments carried out during the year Adults 53 Children 15 In addition 14 Children were notified as having had treatment at the L.C.C. School Treatment Centre, Sedlescombe Road AUTHENTICATION OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION CERTIFICATES In several parts of the world certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation are not accepted unless they are endorsed by a Medical Officer in the Government or Municipal Service of the country of issue. The form of authentication which appears 17 to be most readily accepted by Health Authorities abroad is that given by Public Health Authorities, whereby practitioners signatures are verified by the Medical Officer of Health. The Minister of Health therefore has asked Local Authorities to make arrangements under which any person who desires to have a certificate of vaccination or inoculation for the purpose of travel abroad may have it stamped accordingly at the office of the Health Department. The purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those Health Authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Authenticators are not required to certify that the vaccination or inoculation has been properly carried out or. indeed, that it has been carried out at all the responsibility for issuing the certificate remains with the doctor signing it. This does not imply any suggestion that a certificate of vaccination or inoculation issued by a registered Medical Practitioner requires any official supervision or control in order to be of adequate medical value Authentication is not a requirement of Her Majesty's Government but the proposal is designed as a remedy for difficulties which have in practice been met by persons from this country travelling abroad. During the year a total of 744 certificates of vaccination and/or inoculation were authenticated. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The following bacteriological examinations were carried out for the Council on specimens submitted by general practitioners and the Public Health Department during the year.

LONDON MASS X-RAY SERVICE The South West London Mass X-Ray Service, at its Headquarters in the Western Hospital, Seagrave Road, continued to operate, throughout 1957, the Mass X-Ray Centre which was opened there in September, 1956, and which is available to members of the public without appointment in addition to patients referred by general practitioners. contacts, special groups, and pre-arranged parties from local firms and organisations. From January to March a successful campaign was organised to publicise the Centre, and this included a house-to-house delivery of leaflets which was carried out with great efficiency by the Fulham troops of the Boy Scouts Association. Efforts were continued to persuade men in the over-45 age group to attend for a chest x-ray and a further 4,000 personal letters of reminder were sent out, making a total of 9,680 letters despatched From April to June several thousand appointments were sent out to householders in the wards adjacent to the Western Hospital. The total numbers x-rayed at the Western Hospital centre during the year, were 18,661, which is an average of 350 per week. Of the total examined, 5,156 were referred by general practitioners. In addition to the x-ray examinations carried out at the Static Centre, the mobile mass x-ray units visited eleven firms, St. James' Hall, Moore Park Road and two garden fetes. These visits resulted in a total of 2,073 examinations. 20 It was decided in September that the numbers who found it convenient to journey to the Western Hospital did not justify opening the Centre every day of the week, and regular x-ray sessions are now held every Wednesday from 2.0 p.m - 4.0 p.m and 5.0 p.m. - 7.0 p.m. This has freed a mobile unit to make more visits in South West London. MASS MINIATURE RADIOGRAPHY (Information kindly supplied by the Registrar-General) The following figures relate to the number of Fulham residents X-rayed by any unit in England and Wales. It is gratifying to note the marked increase in 1957, which may be related to the South Western Mass X-Ray Unit, now being based in the Borough at the Western Hospital. Year Males Females Percentage of population examined 1955 4,140 4,970 7.7% 1956 4,850 3,820 7.4% 1957 6,570 5,200 10.1% EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF DR. H.C. PRICE CHEST PHYSICIAN, FULHAM CHEST CLINIC, 1957 The general trend in the tuberculosis statistics noted in recent years has continued; the slight rise in the number of new cases noted last year did not continue and the numbers have fallen from 142 to 124. This latter number, however, is still above the 111 recorded for 1955. In spite of this fall in the number of new cases the number of contacts attending showed little change, being 2,424 in 1957 compared with 2,493 in 1956. In 1956 whereas more females were found to be suffering from tuberculosis than males 73 females to 69 males - in the year under review the ratio returned to normal for the borough, with the figures for the males (74) higher than for females (50). The number of new patients with non-tuberculous disease referred to this clinic (231) showed little change compared with the previous figure (237). This figure includes the 52 additional new cases referred for the bronchitis trials The total attendance figures for non-tuberculous cases rose from 922 to 1,660 for the same reason The total attendances for tuberculous patients tended to fall, entirely due to the running down and final closing of the A.P. clinic sessions. This fall has been masked by the increasing attendances at the non-tuberculous sessions. The number of deaths has increased somewhat this year from 22 to 38. This can be accounted for by the number of chronic tuberculous patients suffering from severe bronchitis and emphysema who died during the winter which was more severe than that of 1956. For the first occasion for many years, the clinic has had an almost unchanged staff of health visitors who have been able to increase the number of home visits from 4,404 to 6,330 which is double the 1955 figure. This has resulted in a great increase in the amount of child contact, observation and follow-up work done. After care The realistic lead given by the council of the N.A.P.T. in changing its terms of reference to include non-tuberculous lung disease and diseases of the heart has been followed by the After Care Committee of the Fulham Chest Clinic, with the result that a considerable number of patients who suffer from acute bronchiolitis during the winter months have been sent away for convalescent holidays of up to 4 weeks in duration. 21 Rehabilitation The regular monthly sessions between the chest physician, almoner, Disabled Resettlement Officer of the Ministry of Labour, and the patient, have continued throughout the year and have proved very satisfactory Non-Tuberculous Chest Disease Cancer of the Lung During the year considerable efforts have been made to speed up the diagnostic facilities available to the general practitioner with particular reference to the need to discover the first signs of carcinoma at the earliest possible stage. This has been possible with the assistance of Dr. L. Grant who carries out a bronchoscopic session each Wednesday afternoon at the Western Hospital, On several occasions during the year it has been possible, with the assistance of the Mass X-ray Unit, to ensure that the interval between the time when the patient is picked up by the Mass X-ray Unit and the time when they are admitted to a bed in the surgical unit or radiotherapy department is not greater than 10 days. I think we should aim to reduce this period still further in the near future, since it is only in the very early stages that any hope exists of effecting a cure at present. Chronic Respiratory Disease Clinic This aspect of the clinic has developed apace during the year and has centred around two clinical trials The first was the ammonia trial, which was a repeat of the one carried out the previous year in association with a bronchitis working party of the Medical Research Council, The second trial was one designed to test the efficacy of an autogenous oral vaccine in the prevention of the acute episodes in chronic bronchitis. An attempt has been made over the last two winters to evolve a scheme of rapid evacuation of such cases out of London, reducing as far as possible the stay at any one centre, so as to facilitate rehabilitation and keep beds at the centre free Our experience here seems to show that the maximum benefit is obtained in the great majority of cases in 10-14 days and that a longer stay than this does not appear to improve the general wellbeing of the patient or lessen the chances of a relapse on return to London Both the Chest Clinic and the Bronchitis Unit at King George V Hospital are equipped to carry out the normal ventilation tests now employed The Unit at King George V Hospital can also investigate diffusion defects and the two units are working in close co operation. Chronic Cardiac Abnormalities A varied number of cases of chronic cardiac failure were seen during the year and E.C.G. examinations carried out some at the request of local practitioners. Where necessary some of these cases were referred to the cardiologist. Results of the Ammonia Trials Despite the fact that many seriously handicapped patients professed to great relief from the use of an ammonia bottle, especially in foggy weather, the analyses of the results from the treated and control groups during the winter of 1956-7 showed no statistical significance between the degree of illness, the amount of sickness absence or the proportion of those going off sick in each of the two groups Similar results have been obtained this winter when the total group of patients was re-randomised and stratified for age and sex and when the overall weather conditions were more severe than in the winter of 1956-7. It would appear' from the results of these trials that the effect of using ammonia vapour to neutralise the sulphuric mist in the London atmosphere during the winter months does not materially affect the course of the disease in a random sample of bronchitics, although it subjectively benefits an unselected group. 22 Temperature - Mean Monthly (Reciprocal) Ammonia Trial 1956-7 Degree of Illness (Mean Monthly Score) 23 COMPARATIVE SUMMARY OF STATISTICS FOR ANNUAL REPORT - 1957 Number of new patients attending * Non Tuberculous Cases 231 ( 237) Contacts 221 ( 220) Transfer-In Notifications 52 ( 51) Others (Notified) by other units in area 11 ( 10) 515 ( 518) Number of New Notifications by Fulham Chest Clinic (Of this figure, 13 were referred by the M.

C. F. THATCHER, LL. B., FOR THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION "Meals on Wheels" A great improvement in the "Meals on Wheels" service was effected in December last by the use of Hotlock containers which were purchased with the aid of a grant from the Mayor of Fulham's Air Raid Distress Fund. The meals are kept hot throughout the whole of the delivery period by means of fuel heated units. During the year our van EWK 707, which was purchased second hand in April 1952 and which the W.V.S. had used on a regular five day service for six years in the delivery of meals and other work reached the end of its useful life and following discussions with members and officers of the Council it was decided not to consider purchasing another van in the name of the Committee but to accept the offer of the use of a Council van, adapted suitably for meals delivery, to be charged to us on an hourly basis Accordingly a Commer vehicle was made available to us and it was possible for the new van and the improved food conveyors to go into service at the same time Again our thanks are due to the W. V. S, whose voluntary helpers keep this important service running The cost of the meals which are supplied by the South London Catering Company is 1s. 9d, each, towards which the London County Council pays 10d. Pensioners are still charged 10d per meal and the balance of 1d. per meal for washing utensils etc is borne by the Committee. Invalid Meals The Invalid Meals for London continues its day to day delivery of meals to pensioners who need special diets. The service is not exclusively for the elderly but pensioners form a large proportion of the recipients. Two vans are operated from the Munster Road Kitchen and in the twelve months ended March last a total of 16,502 meals was delivered The average number of persons who received invalid meals was 84, which number is unfortunately limited by the capacity of the two vans. Chiropody The demand for the chiropody service has continued to grow and towards the end of the municipal year we agreed to add two more sessions of two hours each. We felt this was justifiable in view of the fact that at both clinics there was a waiting list of about 6 weeks for an appointment For information the chiropody sessions which will be provided as from 1st July, 1958 are set out below. It will be seen that the extra sessions will be undertaken by another chiropodist, Mrs. Ursula Taylor, who is a colleague of Miss Hardman. British Red Cross Society, 52 New King's Road, S.W.6. Day Time Chiropodist Tuesdays 9.0 a.m. - 1.0 p.m. Miss Hardman " 2. 0 p.m.- 4. 0 p. m. Mrs, Taylor Bishop Creighton House, 378 Lillie Road, S. W.6.

Miss Hardman 27 Miss Hardman has very kindly obtained a second-hand chiropody chair for the clinic at Bishop Creighton House and now both clinics have the special chair needed for this work. Social Clubs and Luncheon Clubs An up to date list of Old People's Social Clubs and Luncheon Clubs which we had prepared in the form of a handbill is attached to this report for reference. The issue of these handbills we considered necessary as the information on this section of old people's work contained in the publication "Care of the Elderly" is now out of date. Enquiries are regularly received from elderly people and relatives about old people's clubs and for this reason alone the handbills are very useful since they can be handed to enquirers who can select a suitable club from the list. The W. V. S. Coronation Lunch Club, the first to be established in Fulham, had to close due to the transfer of the W. V. S. Centre from Cobb's Hall to Dawes Road. The Revd. J. W. Griffiths, Vicar of St Oswald's and St, Augustine's came to the rescue in solving the problem of alternative premises by allowing the W. V. S. the use of the St. Augustine s Church Hall on 4 days a week Hence the lunch club with some of its old members and retaining its name has been kept going. The luncheon clubs are a boon to those living alone by providing a good mid day meal at a price they can afford. They also help to provide companionship to those who are lonely in the same way as the social clubs, It will be seen that the social clubs at present number 12 and they are as popular as ever. Most of the organisations receive grants from the Council to assist in their clubs' activities which include outings, visits to Women's institutes, concerts, etc. A visit to a club is always worth while. There is always a happy atmosphere and the occasional visitor is warmly welcomed Holiday Scheme Holidays during September 1957 and May/June 1958 were organised for the ninth year in succession The number who participated in the early and late summer schemes and the charges therefor are shown below:- Charge for Accommodation Return Fare Number of Enrolments £ s. d. £ s. d. September 1957 Broadstairs 3 13 6 15 0 78 May / June 1958 Broadstairs 3 13 6 15 0 105 The holiday party was fortunate again in having a fine spell of weather during both the late and early summer periods, but in the period just ended they were unfortunate in having to cope with difficulties caused by the bus strike The day before the holiday started we arranged for a van to pick up luggage and for this to be stored in the Town Hail until the arrival of coaches the following morning The bus strike was still on when the holiday was over and we provided transport again to take luggage to the homes of the old people. His Worship the Mayor (Alderman L. G. Fenton, J.P.) the Mayoress, our Chairman and Mrs. Horton visited the party during the second week and spent an enjoyable day with them during an excellent spell of weather. They were received by the Chairman of the Urban District Council and the Entertainments Officer. We are most grateful for the assistance given to us by St John Ambulance Brigade, the W. V. S. and the British Red Cross Society in providing escorts for the parties on their journeys to and from Broadstairs. 28 Christmas Activities In addition to the usual Christmas party at the Walham Green Methodist Church Hall on Boxing Day, arrangements were made for the distribution of 150 gift parcels to elderly housebound and lonely old people just before Christmas. The names were selected from those submitted by 16 local organisations. The Fulham Grocers' Association very kindly provided at a greatly reduced price the Christmas fare which was delivered in carrier bags by members of the 23rd Fulham Boy Scout Group. The Mayor, as usual, kindly met the expenses of the party, which this year cost £75, out of his Charity Fund and attended the party with the Mayoress. By arrangement with the South London Catering Company, all the recipients of "Meals on Wheels" received a Christmas dinner during Christmas week. The Committee's thanks have been expressed to all who contributed to the success of these activities. Entertainment provided by the Council It is of interest to record that the Borough Council during the winter period provided 12 afternoon concerts, 6 quiz concerts and various evening shows at the Town Hall Whilst these entertainments are not specially for old people, they are greatly enjoyed by elderly persons who form a large proportion of the audience on each occasion. During the summer the Council also provides band concerts and variety entertainments in the parks which again are enjoyed by a large number of elderly persons. Voluntary Visiting The good work of visiting old people in their own homes by clubs and organisations has continued throughout the year. Requests are regularly received from hospitals, relatives and other sources for old people living alone to be visited In the main these are referred to Bishop Creighton House whose 25 visitors perform most valuable work in this field. There is always room for more voluntary helpers in this work to keep pace with the many demands made upon the service. Home Help Service The officers and members of the Committee co-operate fully with the L. .C. C Home Help Service which provides help in the house where it is needed. There are now 87 women helpers and 1 male helper on the register and approximately 60% of the cases assisted are elderly persons. The number of elderly people receiving assistance on 30th March was 430. There is now a night help service in the London area and arrangements can be made for a home help to sit with an elderly person in a case where the doctor considers it is essential that the patient should not be left alone. Activities of Local Organisations (a) W. V.S. Generous hospitality was received by parties of old people from the Women's Institutes in the course of 5 invitations accepted for outings into the country. In addition to the clubs shown on the annexed printed list the W. V. S. run a club for housebound old people (the Autumn Green Club) who during the year had two coach trips and a visit to the Aldershot Tattoo. The Mayoral Green Club was the only club to enter an elderly persons choir competition organised as part of the Bethnal Green Festival of Art and they were awarded second place and a certificate of merit. 29 The friendly contacts made with old people through the "Meals on Wheels" service often enables the W. V. S. to hear of and to pass on to those concerned any special need of the recipients of the meals, thereby performing a valuable service. (b) Fulham Old Age Pensions Association This organisation has had another busy year during which its total membership was maintained at a figure of 400. At its Monday meetings there are free discussions on pensions, the Rent Act, atomic weapons, etc. and there is occasionally a guest speaker. Mr. Michael Stewart, M. P. and Dr. Adams, the Medical Officer of Health, attended on one occasion to speak on the Clean Air Act and on another occasion a police inspector attended to give an interesting talk on crime detection This club now has its own concert party which receives many requests to entertain clubs in other boroughs. (c) Family Welfare Association The work of this general Casework Agency brings its workers into touch with many elderly people in the Borough to whom they are able to give advice about Homes of all descriptions; the Family Welfare Association also administers supplementary pensions from voluntary funds to pensioners whose welfare is assured by regular visits; financial help is also given with material needs and recuperative holidays (if latter recommended on medical grounds) when these are outside the scope of the statutory services, and the Association also acts as local representative for the Wireless for the Bedridden Society. (d) Fulham Philanthropic Society This old established society does good work in the Borough by making grants to those in need a large proportion of whom are the aged and the sick During the very cold weather in the early part of this year grants for coal were made to the Society's pensioners Other old people received assistance towards the cost of a holiday, repairs to radio or in a variety of other ways. (e) British Red Cross Society 658 visits to elderly people were made by this Society during the year The Good Companions Club, which meets at the Munster Park Methodist Chureh Hall continues to flourish and one of its activities this year was a visit to Chartwell This Society runs the Brunswick Luncheon Club which last year served a total of 5,625 lunches. The Society is regularly called upon to provide escorts for elderly people attending hospital and to loan medical aids Apart from the chiropody administered at the clinic at the Society's centre, domiciliary chiropody is arranged periodically for elderly persons unable through incapacity to attend the clinic. (f) Bishop Creighton House The 150 visits made each month by voluntary visitors from Bishop Creighton House to housebound old people is a very valuable contribution to old peoples work Through this friendly contact the Settlement is able to see that the various social services available in the Borough are made known and where necessary brought to those they visit. Membership of the Tuesday and Friday Clubs was maintained during the year and the members enjoyed a full programme of social activities One of the four clubs run by the Settlement is the Hospital Club held in a chronic sick ward at Fulham Hospital. All but a few of the patients are virtually helpless. Those who are able to do so are invited to play games of whist and draughts which helps so much in providing a welcome diversion from routine. More helpers are urgently required for this work. 30 This year, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the Settlement was honoured by a visit from Her Royal Highness, Princess Alice, at a garden party on 10th June and several members of the old peoples clubs attended this celebration. (g) General Particulars of the hospitality offered by the Women's Institutes were brought to the attention of all clubs in the Borough and several enjoyable outings to venues in the country and on the coast were arranged by the clubs whose applications were successful. As in previous years several schools in the Borough generously distributed Harvest Festival produce they had collected to parties of old people. This idea is becoming increasingly popular in the schools and the enthusiastic response from the school children in collecting gifts for the elderly is greatly to be admired. BATHING FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY Public Baths Old people may obtain without charge, a hot bath at the Fulham Baths on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10 a. m. and 12 noon, and 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. I am informed by the Baths Superintendent, Mr. R. C. Gerred, M. N. A.B.S., M. I. Mar. E., that approximately 30-40 persons a week take advantage of these facilities. Home Bathing This service was commenced in April, 1954. It has proved immensely popular and not unduly costly. The following figures show how the service continues to expand. 1956 1957 Number of baths given 1,812 2,170 Number of persons receiving baths 87 98 Number of persons on waiting list at end of year 6 14 There are four Attendants (three female and one male) engaged on this work paid on a sessional basis. S. O. S. CARD SCHEME The S.O.S. Card Scheme was started in August, 1953, with the object of getting help quickly to elderly people in emergency Total cards issued since scheme started 101 Total cards issued during 1957 10 OLD PEOPLE'S LAUNDRY (Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936) Service for Incontinent Persons A scheme under the provisions of this Section to cleanse the linen and bedding of aged infirm and incontinent persons was commenced in March 1952, and is proving of real benefit to sufferers. The work is carried out at the Disinfecting Station where modern equipment is enabling the staff to deal quickly and efficiently with the work 31 By arrangement with Chelsea Borough Council the laundry of their old people is dealt with at the Station, Chelsea providing the transport and paying a charge of 7d per 1b. (dry weight). The following 14,753 articles of Fulham residents were cleansed during the year:- Sheets 3,582 Pillow Cases 1,813 Towels 2,311 Underwear 5,065 Mattress Covers 213 "Pieces" 1,567 Blankets 202 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 Visiting of old people who may come under the above Acts is carried out by the Public Health Department There was 1 compulsory removal under the Amendment Act during 1957 The Order was made for three weeks, the maximum permissible time under this Act. Brief details of this case, which is very typical, are as follows:- Mr. D. J. aged 90 Pound to be living in insanitary conditions and suffering from advanced gangrene of face. Removed to Fulham Hospital where he died four days later. Departmental Records of Old People The details of old persons as they become known are recorded in the Department and the number, although fluctuating, is on the increase.

The following through of the numerous notices already served to successful conclusions was carried out. The value of house to house inspection in maintaining standards cannot be over-emphasised and this work will be resumed directly the necessary staff becomes available. Voluntary work involving the provision and fixing of new and often additional sanitary fittings again increased This trend, commented on in the last annual report, is an indication of rising standards and is to be encouraged.

HOUSING ACT, 19 36 HOUSING ACT, 1957 (A Consolidating Act which cane into force 1st September, 1957) DEMOLITION AND CLOSING ORDERS 1 demolition order was made during the year as follows Premises 25, Lanfrey Place Date of Order 23.10.57 36 One closing order was made in respect of part of a building as follows - Premises 4A Merrington Road Part Closed Basement Rooms Date of Order 17.4.57 Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 Two closing orders were made in respect of whole houses as follows - Premises 193 Dawes Road 4 Lurgan Avenue Date of Order 25.9.57 17.4,57 IMPROVEMENT GRANTS (HOUSING ACT, 1949 ° Section 20 as amended by Section 16 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954) I am indebted to the Borough Architect and Director of Housing, Mr. J- PritchardLovell, F.R.I B A. P.I.Art-, P.P.I.Hsg., for the following figures:- Number of applications received 7 Number referred to Public Health Department for comment 11 (4 applications carried forward from 1956) Number of Grants approved 10 Despite the many explanatory pamphlets issued by the Ministry owners of property do not appear to take advantage of Grants It is hoped, however, that following the recent publicity given to the conversion scheme carried out by the Council to properties in Cedarne Road and the relaxation by the Minister of certain standards relating to self containing and sharing of facilities by aged persons, the number of applications will be increased. SLUM CLEARANCE PROGRAMMES 1951-60 During the year the London County Council took the following steps under the Housing Act. 1957. to implement the Slum Clearance Programmes already agreed with the Borough Council The London County Council Lillie Walk Area Under this Order 43 premises were placed in the clearance area category and in order to provide a suitable site for development the County Council declared their intention to acquire other properties The London County Council Cumberland Crescent Areas Under these Orders 24 premises in Cumberland Crescent and Gorleston Street were placed in the clearance area category The London County Council King's Road Area Under this Order 6 premises were placed in the clearance area category, one further premises being added in order that the site could be properly redeveloped The London County Council Dawes Road Area Under this Order 6 premises were placed in the clearance area category. The London County Council Pearscroft Road Areas and Site Under these Orders 51 premises in Pearscroft Road and Sandilands Road were placed in the clearance area category with the intention stated to acquire adjoining land. The action taken in connection with these areas, together with that carried out in 37 the preceding two years, means that a substantial part of the current joint programme has been accomplished. The remaining action as regards areas to be dealt with before 1960 is, at the time of writing, well under way- The clearing of these areas and those included in the previous five year programme has made a great improvement in the housing conditions of the borough How substantial any future clearance area programme will be will depend largely on the attention given by owners of old properties to the steps necessary to prevent deterioration. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954 Until the Rent Act, 1957, came into force, the trend of last year continued and even fewer tenants found it necessary to exercise their rights to apply for Certificates of Disrepair Once again a standard of "good repair" was maintained at a relatively high level, but no appeals followed the action of the Council in cases dealt with. Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 14 Certificates of Disrepair issued 11 Applications refused 4 Applications for Revocation Certificates 16 Revocation Certificates issued 14 Applications refused 6 No action was taken under Section 11 to secure fitness for occupation by the number of families accommodated, but notices were served under Section 12 on the owners and occupiers of two premises let in furnished rooms. Joint action resulted in the rearrangement of the accommodation occupied by the various families bringing about total abatement of overcrowding. The Council only use these two sections in exceptional cases, as they give owners the legal alternative of reducing the number of occupiers instead of carrying out specified works or otherwise abating overcrowding. RENT ACT 1957 There were revolutionary changes in the law regarding certificates of disrepair when the above Act came into force on July 6th, 1957- The procedure was made noticeably more complicated, and it is not surprising that many landlords and tenants found themselves in need of advice The same machinery for the day-to-day administration as had proved so satisfactory in the past continued in action. Broadly, the examination of documents and the giving of advice was made the responsibility of the Town Clerk s department, whilst the Public Health department undertook inspections, preparation of forms and correspondence At a meeting convened hy the Council at the request of local estate agents useful discussion took place which succeeded in clari fying many points of interpretation of various legal and technical difficulties likely to arise. In all previous similar legislation certificates of disrepair were based on the report of the public health inspector following an inspection of the premises. Under the new procedure the local authority cannot issue a certificate in respect of any defects which the tenant has not himself included in the notice (Form G) he has served on his landlord. They must treat the landlord as not being responsible for internal decorative repair unless the tenant's application for the certificate states he is responsible Before issuing a certificate of disrepair they must be satisfied that all or any of the defects set out ought reasonably to be remedied, having regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling. Pears expressed at the time these changes were first proposed have in some degree proved justified. Sometimes items are included which have to be deleted and, perhaps more important, matters which should receive attention are not included in Form G- The opportunity is taken in appropriate 38 circumstances to offset any omissions by service of notices under public health and housing legislation Comment on another important change in procedure, namely the giving by landlords of undertakings to carry out the tenant's requests within six months, must be reserved until sufficient time has elapsed to see how far these promises have been honoured Certificates can be cancelled by the County Court on the ground of wrongful inclusion of defects, or by the local authority, subject to appeal to the county court, on the grounds that the defects have been remedied There was no recourse to the county court in the year under review ■ Details of action taken between 6th July and 31st December, 1957 are as follows.- Applications for certificates 216 Decisions not to issue certificates 7 Decisions to issue certificates 199 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 138 (b) in respect of all defects 61 Undertakings given by landlords 105 Undertakings refused by Council 1 Certificates issued 63 Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 27 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 8 Council decisions to cancel in spite of tenants objections 4 Certificates cancelled 10 HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 During the year 13 certificates were issued in respect of 212 newly erected and rebuilt premises in the Borough compared with j.63 in 1956 REHOUSING OF FULHAM RESIDENTS Owing to the fact that almost all of the new dwellings becoming available are now being used to rehouse families from slum clearance and compulsory purchase areas, the London County Council found it necessary towards the end of 1956 to revise their arrangements in connection with their housing waiting list. All applicants were informed by letter that it is estimated that during the next three years or so, the total number of dwellings available will not exceed 2 000 Although at first glance this figure may appear reasonable, when it is realised that there are 53 000 families in London in Category A alone the magnitude of the rehousing problem immediately becomes apparent. However, it has been possible for the London County Council to set aside 100 dwellings a year for applicants suffering from some very serious medical condition which is aggravated by housing circumstances, and all such cases must be confirmed by the County Medical Officer of Health As a result of the change in policy the visits paid by the Public Health Inspectors to families in support of housing applications were drastically curtailed 39 DWELLINGS COMPLETED BY THE COUNCIL between 1st January and 31st December 1957 Information supplied by the courtesy of the Borough Architect and Director of Housing.

Two sewer treatments were carried out during the year on the lines agreed with the Infestation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood It is of interest to record that in a high proportion of the rat infestations investigated the cause was found to be defective drains between interceptors and sewers ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION During 19 57 atmospheric measurement stations continued to be maintained by courtesy of the occupying firms, managements at sites selected after consultation with experts from the Puel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research In April, it was considered desirable to effect changes in the siting, The deposit gauges and lead peroxide instruments at Shell Wharf Messrs. Reckitt & Colman s premises in Demorgan Road and Messrs Manbre & Garton s factory in Rannoch Road had been sited in areas where it was known that atmospheric pollution problems were greatest None of the recordings obtained from these sources therefore, was repre sentative of the Borough as a whole. The instruments at the De Morgan Road site were moved accordingly to Queen s Club grounds, a site almost in the centre of the Borough and immediately adjoining the proposed Smoke Control Area No 1 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION YEAR 1957 Month Site RamfalI in inches Insoluble Deposit Soluble Deposit Total Solids Mg of SO3/DAY Collected by 100 sq en of Batch "A" Lead Peroxide (Tons per sq. mile) January Shell Wharf 1 14 100 30 27 95 128.25 2 83 Reckitt & Colman 1.26 17,18 11.78 28.96 4.21 Manbre & Garton 1 18 11 05 8.62 19.67 Fulham Baths - - - - 1.77 February Shell Wharf 2.40 47.36 20.67 68.03 2.59 Reckitt & Colman 2.44 15.57 14.30 29.87 3.34 Manbre & Garton 2.84 126.71 12.84 139.55 - Pulham Baths - - - - 2.27 41 Month Site RainfalI in inches Insoluble Deposit Soluble Deposit Total Sol ids Mg .of So3/DAY Collected by 100 sq.c.m of Batch "A" Lead Peroxide (Tons per sq* mile) March Shell Wharf 0.71 50.12 17.34 67.46 1.33 Reckitt & Colman 0.63 13.69 9.53 23.22 1.74 Manbre & Garton 0.95 115.22 10.58 125.80 - Fulham Baths - - - - 1.34 April Shell Wharf 0.12 17.27 9.08 26.35 1.32 Reckitt & Colman - - - - - Discontinued Manbre & Garton 0.12 82.96 8.14 91.10 - Fulham Baths - - - - 1.09 May Shell Wharf 0.95 32.47 12.44 44.91 1.04 Queens Club 1.30 8.46 5.30 13.76 0.68 Manbre & Garton 0.39 100.90 11.08 111.98 - Fulham Baths - - - - 0.82 June Shell Wharf 1.02 17.75 9.55 27.30 1.70 Queens Club 1.06 9.77 5.13 14.90 0.77 Manbre & Garton 0.63 94.95 8.58 103.53 - Fulham Baths - - - - 0.71 July Siell Wharf 2.40 31.11 17.34 48.45 1.88 Queens Club 2.99 4.46 6.18 10.64 0.77 Manbre & Garton 2.88 123.67 12.64 136.31 - Fulham Baths - - - - 1.31 August Shell Wharf 2.68 34.85 18.50 53.35 1.72 Queens Club 2.21 7.85 4.93 12.78 1.02 Manbre & Garton 1.97 182.8 9.06 191.86 - Fulham Baths - - - - 1.45 September Shell Wharf 1.73 50.59 14.35 64. 94 1.81 Queens Club 0.83 1.85 2.32 4.17 0.79 Manbre & Garton 2.25 180.78 32.98 213.76 - Fulham Baths - - - - 1.34 October Shell Wharf 1.58 45.56 16 52 62.08 2.86 Queens Club 1.69 4.56 4.50 9 06 1.38 Manbre & Garton 1 58 118.94 9.49 128.43 _ Ftolham Baths - - - - 2.58 November Shell Wharf 1.97 12.85 11,22 24.07 4.02 Queens Club 1.89 2.82 8.66 11.48 1.97 Manbre & Garton 2.17 70.62 10.68 81.30 - Fulham Baths - - - - 3.25 December Shell Wharf 1.06 39 61 14.65 54.26 3.02 Queens Club 2.05 7.92 7.25 15.17 2.11 Manbre & Garton 1.81 119.95 12,37 132 32 _ Fulham Baths - - - - 4.15 Staining of Laundry in Sands End Ward Yellow staining of laundry occurred in a number of streets in Sands End Ward, and particularly in Edenvale Street, which resulted in the presentation of a petition by a large number of residents to the Council. Considerable investigations as to the cause were undertaken and officers of the Meteorological Office, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, together with the Council s Analyst, were brought into consultation. It was established that the staining was caused by particles containing iron sulphate falling on damp washing* Such particles can come from the combustion of both oil and coal fuels under certain conditions. 42 As investigations proceeded it became evident they could not be attributed to any one source Whilst it was appreciated that the matter was not one regarding which the Council could take statutory action, nevertheless every possible endeavour was made to help In effect problems like this are almost bound to arise where heavy industry and dwelling houses are side by side and this points to one of the reasons why town planning is so important. 280 visits were made to local residents in connection with this problem tay the Public Health Inspectors. CLEAN AIR ACT 1956 I would like briefly to refer to the background of this Act which is recognised as one of the greatest public health measures passed for many years. The spark which ignited the gunpowder of public opinion was undoubtedly the disastrous fog of December 1952, which caused the deaths of over 4,000 people in the Greater London area alone The Government set up a Committee in July 1953 under the Chairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver with the following terms of reference - "to examine the nature, causes and effects of air pollution and the efficacy of present preventive measures to consider what further preventive measures are practicable and to make recommendations," This Committee published its report on 10th November, 1954, and this report formed the basis of the Clean Air Act An Act which all the political parties supported thus enabling it to have a speedy passage through Parliament, receiving the Royal Assent in July of 1956 The Act has four main purposes which are as follows (i) to prohibit the emission of dark smoke from chimneys, railway engines and vessels, subject to certain qualifications. (ii) to prohibit the installation of new industrial furnaces unless they are capable, so far as practicable, of being operated without emitting smoke. (iii) to require that the emission of grit and dust from existing industrial fur naces shall be minimised and that now industrial furnaces burning pulverised fuel or large quantities of other solid fuel shall be provided with grit arresting equipment. (iv) to empower local authorities by order, subject to confirmation by the Minister concerned, to declare "smoke control areas", in which the emission of smoke from chimneys will constitute an offence In other words everyone and everything contributing in the slightest degree to the problem must be control led* The following provisions of the Act which are the responsibility of the Council to enforce, came into effect on the 31st December, 1956, and were (1) Installation of new furnaces. (2) Research and Publicity. (3) Smoke Control Areas. Of these the provision of Smoke Control Areas is undoubtedly the most important and a report on this matter was submitted to the Public Health Committee in March. Following this the Council decided., in principle, to make the whole of Fulham a Snoke Control Area and to achieve this the Borough has been provisionally divided into ten areas The plan is to deal with one area a year, although this may be altered according to circumstances. The first area was selected for the following reasons • 43 (1) it was of reasonable size; (2) the industry in the area was of small type and presented no difficulty; (3) the area contained a variety of dwellings - Council flats, houses, flats and tenements in private ownership, commercial shops and offices; (4) it was almost in the centre of the Borough and this gave the advantage that areas of similar type could be added, and secondly, the Council could go ahead at their own pace without having any necessity to wait for action by adjoining authorities; (5) Council flats in this area being post-war built, no adaptations would be necessary and most of the grates in this area were capable of adaptation or replacement in the cheaper range of prices: (6) Nearly all, if not all, the premises in the area had gas laid on - a big factor from the point of view of cost of adaptations. The results of the 25% survey of the area were submitted to the Public Health Committee late in May, and the Minister of Housing and Local Government gave his approval, in principle, early in August. The results of the detailed survey of the whole of this area were submitted to the Council on the 20th November. At that meeting the Smoke Control Order was made by the Council and then sent to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for his confirmation (Note This was actually received on the 13th March, 1958. No objections were received to the making of the order). Details of the Order operative date 1.10.58 are as follows - "FULHAM BOROUGH COUNCIL (NO. 1) SMOKE CONTROL ORDER 1957" Number of industrial premises 53 Number of commercial premises 145 Number of dwellings 3,729 Number of other premises 26 There was no necessity to make any exemptions under the Order.

Total estimated Council contribution £10,382 Staffing: The survey of the first area was carried out by three District Public Health Inspectors assisted by the three Student Public Health Inspectors. Subse quently, it was decided to employ Enquiry Officers for this work and two were engaged. The. preliminary clerical work involved was absorbed by the existing staff, as it was recognised that not until the Order was confirmed and people made application for grant aid would there be any necessity to employ a clerk full time on this work* For the same reason it was envisaged that a technical officer, to be known as the Clean Air Officer, would require to be appointed to give advice and certify that the adaptations and installations had been correctly carried out- PubIicity: Details of the publicity given to the Council s plans are contained in the Health Education section of this report, Every opportunity has been taken to consult with all interested parties at all stages and all levels, and the co operation of everyone approached has been a most heartening feature*. As far as can be judged at this stage, the majority of the residents of the first area have welcomed the action taken 45 FACTORIES ACT, 1937 - PART I SECTION 8 In anticipation of the coming into operation of the provisions of The Clean Air Act regarding smoke emissions etc. from industrial premises, the opportunity was taken during the course of inspections to obtain as much background information on the boiler installations as possible.

Examination of Food and Seizure of Unsound Food Certain articles of food which are liable to be adulterated are controlled by sampling and chemical analysis by the Public Analyst, but foods which deteriorate in quality and become unfit for human consumption are supervised by inspection and seizure with subsequent condemnation by a Justice of the Peace and destruction. In July a quantity of Vienna steaks were seized from a restaurant kitchen and condemned by a Justice of the Peace, Subsequently at the Magistrate's Court the proprietor was fined £50 with £10 10s, od„ costs for having in his possession for the purpose of sale, food which was unfit for human consumption. Voluntary Surrender of Food In practice,, shopkeepers make very little attempt to sell to the public any foodstuff which is unfit for human consumption and it is customary for retailers who find food they have purchased from wholesalers to be unsound at the time they receive it or to have become unfit after storage on their premises to notify the local authority, and request an inspection by the district public health inspector who will, if satisfied after examination that the food is unfit, issue a certificate to that effect and arrange for its removal to, and destruction at, the Council's Refuse Destructor. During 1957, 1,796 Certificates of Condemnation were issued by the public health inspectors relating to the undermentioned voluntarily surrendered foods:- Tinned Packeted and Bottled Pood 10,251 items Cheese 289 lbs, Milk Powder 32 tons 16 cwts. Dried Fruit 32 lbs. Prawns 10 lbs. Bacon 10 lbs, Rabbit 49 lbs Chicken 437 lbs. Melons 63 cases Pears 3½ tons Grapes 1 ton 6 cwts. Fish 62 stone Meat 3,207 lbs.

Ice Cream must be kept at a temperature of not more than 28°P. and should the temperature rise above 28°F. the ice cream must be subject to further heat treatment and kept at a temperature not exceeding 28°P. The Methylene blue test is recommended as a guide for ascertaining the bacteriological cleanliness of ice-cream, the time taken to decolourise Methylene blue being recorded and the samples graded as follows:- Provisional Grade 1 2 3 4 Time taken to reduce Methylene Blue 4½ hours or more 2½ to 4 hours ½ to 2 hours Less than ½ hour In addition to the above 17 ice lollies were examined all of which satisfied the requirements of Grade 1. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1953 This Order lays down the following standards for Ice Cream- Fat 5% Sugar 10% Milk solids other than fat 7, 5% During 1957, 21 samples of ice cream were purchased for chemical analysis by the Public Analyst all of which were reported to be genuine, a summary of the results being:- Percentage of fat No. of samples Less than 5% - 5% - 7½% 8 7½%- 10% 9 Over 10% 4 The average fat content of all samples was 8, 30%„ Registration of Purveyors of Milk The arrangement whereby milk was sold from retail shops continued and there were on the register at the end of the year 134 number of premises so engaged Number of Inspections of milk shops 95 Number of Inspections of Dairies 84 During 1957, 42 samples of ice cream were examined with the following results:- Grade Wtrapped Bulk Supply Total 1 27 14 41 2 - 1 1 3 - - - 4 - -- - 27 15 42 51 Food and Drugs Sampling During the year 800 samples of food and drugs were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis The Public Analyst reported adversely on 54 or 6 75% of the samples examined Legal proceedings were instituted in respect of two samples (1) Section 6 - Milky Crunch (sample No 559) misleading description. Case dismissed 5 guineas costs against Council (2) Section 2 - Roll and butter (sample No 913) Sample was roll and margarine Conditional discharge. Defendant to pay 5 guineas costs Rather more emphasis was given during the year to the sampling of canned meats and sausage rolls In the case of the former a standard of 75% total meat was the standard by which the samples were measured and in the case of the latter a total meat content of 20% of the total weight of the roll Particular attention was paid to imported canned meat and the scope of the sampling was not completed by the end of the year. The investigation into the content of sausage rolls too was continuing at the end of the year. It is proposed to include the full results of the surveys in the report for 1958.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF CREAM CONFECTIONERY 153 samples of cream fillers were submitted for bacteriological examination during the year, results being generally satisfactory. Coliform and staph organisms were sought and, in eight samples faecal coli was found to be present. Staph aureus was found in four samples All the contamination occurred in isolated samples and follow up action was taken in each case, followed by satisfactory samples. The following gives a broad indication of the results:- Free from B, Coli and Staph 42 B. Coli (NF) present 99 B. Coli (faecal) present 8 Staph. aureus positive 4 Staph. aureus negative 114 The figure of 153 includes two samples of cream cake, submitted for colony count. FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS Regular inspections were carried out during the year. In no case was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. Type of Business No. of premises No. of Inspections Bakehouses (non-basement) 28 Bakehouses (basement) 9 148 Bread and Cake shops 11 110 Butchers' shops 75 316 Confectionery 68 76 Cooked Meat shops 15 19 Total C/f. 206 669 55 Type of Business No. of premises No. of Inspections Total B/f. 206 669 Milk Pasteurising Establishments 1 Bottled Milk Depots 2 186 Milk shops 137 Eel and Pie shops 3 5 Pood Factories 6 19 Fishmongers' shops 28 84 Fried Fish shops 32 58 General Food shops 225 883 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 121 416 Horseflesh butchers 3 1 Ice Cream (Manufacturers and Dealers) 170 302 Licensed Premises 104 102 Restaurants and Dining rooms 148 683 Stalls 100 1,693 Stallholders' Storage premises 44 54 Other Food premises 12 361 Totals 1, 342 5,521 Details of the more important improvements which have been effected in food premises during the year are given below:- Wash-hand basins 14 Water heaters 22 New sinks provided 13 New .W.

The final decision as to the continued use of the premises has not been made. 56 POOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS 1955 Following the close of the Clean Food Campaign towards the end of March, the remainder of the year was taken up in the steady implementation of the Regulations to all food premises At the end of the year most premises were complying with the Regulations so far as these related to facilities and equipment and the major problem became the personal factor of the employees Although the thoughtful food handler was eager and willing to co operate, in some cases the provision of the most modern equipment failed to instil a sense of responsibility into the employee, and one was compelled to admit that some food handlers were being asked to display a higher standard of hygiene in their daily work than seemed likely they observed in their own homes Clearly discernible in general trends was the higher standard of hygiene the general public were coming to expect in food premises and this often unspoken expectation can be as potent a factor as any set of regulations. The general high standard of industrial canteens indicates that industrialists and their managerial staffs are aware of the strict routines necessary if the large scale provision of meals is to be adequately safeguarded against the spread of pathogenic organisms. The North End Road Market remained a far from solved problem but here again, the knowledge that there are such things as Pood Hygiene Regulations; and their import, began to come more easily to the minds of the traders This may have been due to steady, polite requests to do this or that or not to do this or that. No prosecutions under the Regulations were instituted during the year, the accent throughout being on education. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ANALYST- THOMAS McLACHLAN During the year 1957 800 samples of food and drugs were examined Of these 687 were taken formally and 113 informally. The number adulterated or about which some comment was made was 54 The incidence of adulteration may be classified as follows:- Number of samples examined Number of samples adulterated Milk 179 2 Other foods 594 48 Drugs 27 4 One sample of milk contained less than 8.5 per cent namely 8.36 per cent of milk solids not fat and therefore contained not less than 1.6 per cent of added water The freezing point- 0.524°C. indicated the presence of 2.6 per cent of added water. Another sample of milk contained only 3.09 per cent of fat and 8.46 per cent of solids not fat In this case the freezing point- 0.522°C. indicated an added water content of 3 per cent. even though the solids not fat figure almost complied with the require ments of the Sale of Milk Regulations. Some condensed skimmed milk was reported as inferior because it was a very dark colour In a recent High Court case it was agreed that a dark colour militates against the acceptance of condensed milk as being satisfactory to the housewife. A dark colour generally means that it is either old stock or has been badly prepared. 57 A roll spread with margarine was sold as a roll and butter and was therefore adulterated. A loaf of bread contained a dark streak caused by gear oil from the shafting of the plant used for mixing the dough. This occurrence is common at the present time and is due to carelessness in bakeries. A chocolate spread was satisfactory, but the ingredients were not given on the label in the correct order, Some confectionery described as "Milky Crunch" was considered to have a misleading label as it contained no milk Although the magistrate decided that the description was not misleading the defending counsel gave an undertaking that the name would be changed. A sample of mixed dried fruit contained two maggots and was reported as adulterated, and one of sultanas contained 9.5 per cent of currants and 90.5 per cent of sultanas Although one or two odd currants might be accidentally present the percentage in this sample was considered too high. A fruit juice drink sold as "Liquid Apples" was considered to be incorrectly labelled A 10 oz. bottle was stated to contain all the juice of 1 lb. of apples. whereas 1 lb. of apples contains more than 10 fl. ozs. of juice, although the quantity is variable.The label should state that the bottle contained the pure unfermented juice extractable from 1 lb. of English apples. Exception was also taken to the description "Bitter Sparkling Orange Drink" The labels on the bottle named the contents as "Bitter Orange" in large letters with "Sparkling Drink" in smaller lettering in another. his liquid is becoming increasingly popular for addition to gin as a cocktail but, so far as your analyst has been able to ascertain, those drinking it believe that the bitterness is derived solely from the oranges whereas it is largely due to the presence of quinine. Your analyst is, therefore, of the opinion that the description "Bitter Orange" is misleading. A bottle labelled Quinine Tonic Water was found to contain lemonade and was therefore incorrectly labelled. A sample of lemon juice was found to be deficient in Vitamin C content, but the deficiency might have resulted from the method of sampling and the manufacturer was given the benefit of the doubt. A complaint sample of orangeade contained fragments and conglomerations of penicillium mould mycelium. Although the bottle was only between one-quarter and one third full when received the rubber gasket on the stopper was in a very perished condition. If the gasket had not been removed when the stopper was washed it is probable that mould hyphae had been caught in some of the cracks in the rubber and that these had spread into the orangeade. On the other hand the bottle may never have been properly sealed owing to the minute cracks in the rubber gasket. A stewed beef steak contained only 85 per cent of meat. The revoked Meat Products Order required stewed beef steak to contain 95 per cent of meat, and this sample was reported as inferior. The manufacturers informed the Council that they now label this product "Stewed Steak with Gravy" and the sample must have been old stock Another sample of stewed steak by a different manufacturer contained only 74 per cent of meat. This also was incorrectly labelled and should have been sold as Stewed Steak with Gravy. Two samples of beef steak with gravy were reported as adulterated One contained only 68 per cent and the other 62 per cent of meat. Beef Steak with Gravy should contain not less than 75 per cent of meat. 58 A can of "Casserole Steak" contained 67 per cent total meat, and was therefore 10 per cent deficient in meat. Casserole steak should, if anything, contain less rather than more water than stewed steak with gravy. A sample of canned Irish Stew was found to contain only 35 per cent of total meat, whereas during and just after the war canned Irish Stew contained 45 per cent of meat and this was the quantity of meat required to be present by the revoked Meat Products No. 2 Order, 1952. A further sample contained only 27 per cent of total meat and examination of recipes given in cookery books shows that 33-35 per cent is the amount of meat usually required. Under the circumstances it is doubtful whether one can now insist on a 45 per cent meat content, which would make a canned meat product a different article from that normally consumed. Four samples of pork sausages were found to be deficient in meat content Two samples contained 59 per cent and two others 62 per cent of meat. Pork sausages must contain not less than 65 per cent of meat. Some beef sausages contained 200 parts per million of sulphur dioxide without any intimation that they were preserved. Nine samples of sausage rolls were deficient in meat contents. One contained only 11.2 per cent of meat, another taken as a follow up contained 16.88 per cent of meat, but a further sample taken later proved satisfactory. The other 7 samples contained 9.2. 12.0, 12.7, 13.1, 15.1, 15,7 and 17.8 per cent of meat respectively. Your analyst, supported by other public analysts, believes that a sausage roll should contain not less than 20 per cent of meat. Several samples of Christmas puddings were examined and found to contain less fat than had been required at one time under the revoked Flour Confectionery Order With the increases in the quantity of fruit used in their manufacture less fat is required because of the use of less flour. A sample of marzipan contained not more than 12 per cent of ground almonds. Public analysts agree that marzipan must contain about 25 per cent of ground almonds, which would be about 23 per cent of dried ground almonds and are taking part in discussions with the trade on this matter 12 per cent of ground almonds is at least 40 per cent deficient. Some smoked saithe, packed in vegetable oil, was reported as inferior because the oil contained 6 .4 per cent of free fatty acid and was rancid. Certain types of sauce are exempt from giving their ingredients on the label and one such sauce having made the disclosure, gave it incorrectly as the ingredients were not listed in the right order The manufacturers agreed to amend the label. A sample of mint sauce was reported as inferior because of an unsatisfactory odour and flavour. The odour was slightly perfumed and the mint tasted like grass, though microscopic examination failed to reveal the presence of any grass. Further samples possessed satisfactory odours and flavours, but some of them were incorrectly labelled. The onions in a jar of pickled onions were soft, due to poor pickling and were reported as inferior. Samples of pickled gherkins and pickled red cabbage were also reported as inferior They had been preserved with a dilute solution of acetic acid and salt, but the texture of both products gave the impression that the raw vegetables had been immersed in a weak salt-acetic acid solution and had undergone no process of pickling as generally understood. The label of the gherkins stated that caramel was present, but if any caramel had been added it must have been absorbed on to the gherkins because the acid liquor was colourless. The manufacturers stated that they washed the brined vegetables prior to the addition of acetic acid, but were taking immediate steps to control the content of both salt and acetic acid in their products. 59 A follow up sample of gherkins contained 5 per cent of acetic acid, which is far too acid, and the gherkins were hard, but further samples received later were satisfactory. A bottle of tomato ketchup was incorrectly labelled, the list of contents was incorrect and some attempt appeared to have been made to convert the ''20 fl, ozs," printed on the label into "7 f1 ozs," The quantity contained in the bottle of a sample of non-brewed condiment was not given on the printed label. Another non-brewed condiment contained only 3.18 per cent of acetic acid and was therefore 20 per cent deficient in acetic acid. Non-brewed condiment must contain not less than 4 per cent of acetic acid. A later sample of the same make showed that the matter had been adjusted and the strength of acetic acid had been-raised to 4.89 per cent. A sample of vinegar contained L 25 per cent of salt, which had been added in order to improve the keeping qualities The vinegar tasted salty but no mention of the presence of salt had been made on the label. Glucose tablets were labelled in such a manner as to suggest the presence of vitamins when they did not contain any The manufacturers had already promised another authority to amend the label and had asked for a reasonable time to have new labels printed and to clear old stocks,, This sample was from earlier stock. A Cold and Influenza Mixture was satisfactory but owing to a slight error in preparing the label it should have contained nearly twice as much camphor water as was really present. Some "Paregoric* tablets were in reality aniseed flavoured boiled sweets and contained no morphine Tincture of opium is an official dangerous drug with morphine as its principal ingredient and tincture of morphine is the principal active con stituent of paregoric A flavoured sweet must, therefore, not be sold under a title which implies that it contains a dangerous drug A sample of ammoniated tincture of quinine was reported as inferior as it con tained L87 per cent of quinine. The British Pharmaceutical Codex stipulates that the quinine should be from 1.56 to 1.76 per cent, so that there was a slight excess of quinine in the mixture A sample labelled "Lemon Glycerin Honey with Ipecac" was considered to be misleading as it contained only 0,13 per cent of oil of lemon The principal active constituent of the medicine was syrup of squill; none of the substance used in the name were really efficacious in the syrup Legislation and Official Reports The amount of fresh legislation and the number of official reports issued has again shown a decrease during the year The Public Analysts Regulations have been re issued in order to provide a new form of certificate to meet conditions resulting from the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 With the new Act it may be necessary for a public analyst if he is unable to carry out the whole of the work required to pass a sample to the public analyst for some other area for examination. This revised certificate provides at the same time for those cases where adverse comment may be made on a label advertisement, or other matter, which may or may not be dependent on chemical analysis, but on which the public analyst is the most conpetent authority 60 The Colouring Matter in Food Regulations came into force in 1957 and revoked that part of the Preservatives, etc. in Food Regulations relating to the addition of colours to foods. Although the regulations came into force on the 30th June, 1957, they do not come into effective operation in the current year as regards sale of food by retail. This was essential if a smooth flow from the manufacurer of food colours to the retail sale of foods was to be obtained. The Order therefore stipulated that the manufacturer of food colours or compounds for colouring and flavouring must comply with the order by the 30th September, 1957, whereas in general it may be stated that food sold by retail must comply with the requirements of the order by the 30th June, 1958. For over thirty years the Preservatives, etc. in Pood Regulations have provided a short list of colours, whose addition to food was forbidden. Many colours have been found to be suspect of causing cancer and the new order permits the use of thirty organic chemical dyes together with a few more or less natural ones, which have been used over many years It is hardly necessary to state that this order imposes much more work on the analyst for its efficient administration. The Pre-Packed Poods (Weights and Measures: Marking) Regulations were made under Sections 6 and 123 of the Pood and Drugs Act, and are administered by Weights and Measures Authorities only and not by other Pood Authorities. When there is a matter of the content of a particular food, mixed with other ingredients, one would have thought it better to handle the matter via the food inspector and the public analyst. Your analyst had submitted to him a tin marked to contain a definite weight of smoked salmon, but in which more oil (undeclared) was present than salmon, the declared weight being that of the total contents of the tin. While this matter can be handled in other ways one would have thought that this order would have been the simplest one. The Food Standards Committee issued a Report on a Standard for Ice cream. Essentially this report proposes to maintain the present standards for ice cream with the prohibition of the use of saccharin and other artificial sweeteners, except in the case of ice cream made for diabetics, which could be suitably labelled The Committee recommend, however, that provision should be made for "dairy ice cream", of which the fat should be entirely milk fat, and "milk ice'' made on the basis of the old fashioned hokey-pokey, which is essentially a custard-type ice with a milk fat content of not less than 2.5 per cent. The Food Standards Committee also issued a revised Report on Fluorine. The previous report was issued in 1947 following the discovery of very large quantities of fluorine in phosphates used in baking powders resulting from the emergency conditions caused by the war. These circumstances have now disappeared and it is proposed to restrict drastically the quantities of fluorine permitted in acidic phosphates used for foods, in baking powders and in flour products containing such phosphates. There is, however, a considerable delay between the issue of Reports by the Food Standards Committee and ensuing legislation. Thus the following Reports have appeared:- Report on Antioxidants. The revised report appeared in 1954, but no legislation has followed so far. Now that the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations have removed colours from the orbit of the Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations, the time is ripe for a fresh order. Second Report on Processed Cheese and Cheese Spread. This revised report appeared in 1956. Legislation is also required to control the descriptions of skimmed, partially skimmed, and so called cream cheeses. Report on Emulsifying and Stabilising Agents This report appeared in 1956. Reports have been issued on Arsenic (Revised Report. 1955), Copper (1956), Lead (Revised Report, 1954), Tin (1952), and Zinc (1954), but no further action has ensued 61 although it is believed that an Order controlling the quantity of arsenic in food may not be long delayed now. The Pood Standards (Soft Drinks) Order was last revised in 1953 and it was immediately pointed out that the definition of drinks made from "Whole fresh oranges" was ambiguous and needed clarification, but no revised order has yet appeared. When delays of two years or more occur after the issue of Reports of the Food Standards Committee without any administrative action being taken by the Government, it places food administration by Local Authorities in a difficult position and manufacturers are left in a quandary. Reputable manufacturers hesitate to act merely on the recommendations of the Pood Standards Committee, whilst others are prepared to take a risk. Public analysts on the other hand are loath to condemn products, which comply with the proposals of a Standing Government Committee, because of the risk of caustic comments from the Courts. In spite of the continual pressure of Local Authorities and Public analysts no order has yet been made to control the meat content of sausages, though one would have expected more regard to have been paid to the comments of the Lord Chief Justice on this point Other products, such as stewed steak, stewed steak in gravy and luncheon meat show a continued deterioration in the quantity of the meat present, but the Courts are unwilling to lay down standards when the Government seems unable to do so. There is much so-called chocolate on the market at the present time containing large quantities of hardened palm kernel oil instead of cocoa butter and milk chocolate containing separated milk powder. The year 1960 will mark the centenary of the passing of the first food and drugs act and the inaction of the Government at the present time reminds one strongly of the inertia shown by Governments of that time and the efforts made by Dr. Wakeley, in setting up the Lancet Commission, and others in order to force their hands. It is difficult to know to what extent the present position has arisen from the frequent changes taking place at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, where food administration appears, at the present time, to be a training ground for higher office either in the political field or in the administrative service. Looking to the future, Public Analysts are deeply concerned by the need to safe guard the public against the effects of radioactivityo The recent incident at Windscale brought the matter into prominence, but even before that a good deal of preliminary work had been done by public analysts The task of monitoring pastures, crops etc in the vicinity of atomic installations is vested in the Ministry of Agriculture by the Atomic Energy Act, but the ultimate responsibility for the protection of the public must rest on the Public Analyst Many foods are imported from abroad, from regions which may be affected by "fall-out" from test explosions, or canned fish may come from seas into which radioactive effluents flow Pish may concentrate radioactive elements up to two million times the amount in the sea water in which they live As the complexity of the work has increased so has the equipment of the analyst's laboratory The crude adulteration of the earlier years demanded only the simplest equipment but the tasks of today require the use of complex physical instruments such as absorptiometers flamephotometers, polarographs, etc Without these instruments the determination of many essential factors, such as vitamins, would be impossible. As an example, your analyst has recently purchased a spectrophotometer which, with the ancillary equipment cost over £800, Not many years ago a large laboratory could have been equipped for such a sum The use of such equipment moreover requires highly skilled staff, who are difficult to obtain when the demand for scientists exceeds the supply and more lucrative fields are open to them How the situation can best be handled is difficult to foresee. but it is one to which considerable thought must be given in the near future, Thomas McLachlan Public Analyst, 62 FULHAM ANNUAL REPORT, 1957 Article Number examined Number adulterated, etc. Formal Informal Private Total Formal Informal Private Total Ale 14 14 Apple Puree 1 1 Arrowroot 1 1 Baking Powder 2 2 Bicarbonate of Soda 6 6 Bread 1 1 1 1 Bread Roll and Butter 1 1 1 1 Butter 21 21 Cake Mixture 3 3 Cheese 5 5 Cheese Spread 4 1 5 Cheese Processed 1 1 Chicken fillets 1 1 Chicken fillets (canned) 1 1 Cider 2 2 Coffee and Chicory Essence 4 1 5 Confectionery 13 1 14 Continental Condiment 2 2 2 2 Cornflour 1 1 Cream 39 3 42 Cream of Tartar 3 3 Custard Powder 6 1 7 Dripping 1 1 Pish (canned) 4 4 Pish (dressed crab) 1 1 Pish Paste 4 4 Pish - smoked Saithe 1 1 1 1 Flavouring - almond 1 1 Flour 10 10 Fruit (canned) 1 1 2 Fruit (dried) 47 47 2 2 Fruit (juice) 4 4 8 1 1 Gherkins 1 1 Herbs: Mint 5 1 6 Mixed Herbs 2 2 Parsley 4 4 Sage 2 2 Thyme 2 2 Horseradish Cream 1 1 " Grated 1 1 " Sauce 1 1 Ice Cream 15 6 21 Ice Lolly 1 1 2 Jam 12 12 Jelly 9 9 Lard 3 3 Margarine 6 6 Marmalade 12 12 Marzipan 1 2 3 1 1 Meat (canned) 7 15 22 1 6 7 Meat Paste 5 5 Meat Pudding (canned) 1 1 Milk- 179 179 2 2 Milk (condensed) 2 2 1 1 Milk (evaporated) 2 2 Mincemeat 8 1 9 Mint (garden) 1 1 Mint Sauce 2 1 3 1 1 2 C/f 478 52 530 12 9 21 63 Article Number examined Number adulterated, etc Formal Informal Private Total Formal Informal Private Total B/f 478 52 530 12 9 21 Mint in Vinegar 2 2 Non brewed Condiment 7 7 2 2 Oatmeal 1 1 Paste (fish) 1 1 2 Peel - cut - mixed 2 2 Pepper flavoured compound 1 1 Pepper - white 3 3 Pickles 5 3 8 2 2 Pickled Cabbage 1 1 Pickled Gherkins 2 2 1 1 Pickled Onions 2 2 1 1 Pudding Mixture 1 1 Pudding Xmas 10 10 3 3 Rice 6 6 Sauce 11 3 14 2 2 Sausages 19 1 20 4 1 5 Sausage Rolls 1 21 22 7 7 Semolina 1 1 Soft Drinks 47 5 52 1 3 4 Soup (Canned) 2 2 Soup (Powder) 7 3 10 'Spices: Cinnamon 2 2 Curry Powder 1 1 Ginger 2 2 Mixed Spice 3 3 Nutmeg 1 1 Pepper, White 1 1 Spirits: Gin 2 2 Rum 1 1 Whisky 7 7 Spread (cheese) 5 5 " (chocolate) 1 1 1 1 '' (fish) 1 1 " (savoury) 4 4 Suet, shredded 2 2 Sugar, demerara 5 1 6 Sweetener 1 1 Tapioca 4 4 Tartaric Acid 1 1 Tea 16 16 Tomatoes (canned) 1 1 Vegetables (mixed dried) 1 1 Vinegar 7 7 1 1 Wine: Sherry 1 1 Wine 3 3 Drugs: Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 2 1 3 1 1 Aspirin Tablets 8 1 9 1 1 Borax 1 1 Camphorated Oil 1 1 Children's Soothing Powder 1 1 Cold & Influenza Mixture 1 1 Compound Essence of Liquorice 1 1 Epsom Salts 2 2 Friars Balsam 1 1 Glucose Tablets 1 1 1 1 Influenza Mixture 1 1 Lemon Glycerine & Honey 1 1 1 1 Liquid Paraffin 1 1 Quinine & Cinnamon Preparation 1 1 Seidlitz Powder 1 1 Syrup of Pigs 1 1 Total 687 113 800 27 27 54 64 Section F Miscellaneous Services Page Legislation daring year 65 Health Education 65 Mortury 67 National Assistance Act - Burials 68 Public Conveniences 68 Medical Examinations 69 Pharmacy and Poisons Act 69 Pet Animals Act 70 Rag Flock and Other Pilling Materials Act 70 65 ACTS OF PARLIAMENT, STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS and CIRCULARS ISSUED BY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS RELATING TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES during 1957 Acts of Parliament: Rent Act, 1957 Housing Act, 1957 Statutory Instruments: Food Hygiene (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1956.

HEALTH EDUCATION The following activities were carried out during the year the majority of them taking place during the winter months following a circular letter to all organisations in the Borough, sent out in September, telling them of the facilities available for talks and discussions. Discussion Groups and Talks: Given by various members of the Department, usually on some particular aspect of the Department s work. Eighteen Talks and Discussion Groups were presented to a total of four hundred and ninety persons, the average attendance being twenty seven. 66 Film Shows: The attendance at film shows has steadily decreased during the last two years, probably due to the influence of television. As the last five shows, held from September to December, only produced an average attendance of sixty two, the Public Health Committee reluctantly decided to cancel the second half of the winter's programme, January to March, 1958, and not to run any more shows. These shows were expensive to run, the average cost being £10, and it has always been felt that there should be a minimum audience of one hundred persons to justify the expense. These shows have been held since 1951 and the following summary is appended to show the fluctuation in attendance:- Year No. of Shows Total Attendance Average At tendance 1951 4 552 138 1952 10 1,303 130 1953 13 1,642 126 1954 15 1,875 125 1955 14 1,442 103 1956 14 1,389 99 1957 12 991 83 Clean Air Act, 1956 The principal educational activity of the year was telling the people of Fulham how the decision of the Council to make the whole of the Borough a Smoke Control Area was to be implemented. The Act empowers authorities to take every practical means to enable this to be done and, in a memorandum on Smoke Control Areas, issued by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, it was stated that "If the Minister agrees that the proposal (i.e. to create a Smoke Control Area) may proceed the local authority will be ready to start on a detailed survey of the area. The goodwill and co operation of the public will be indispensable and the local authority will want to give as much publicity as possible at this stage to their decision to proceed with the declaration of a smoke control area. If it is among their first areas, publicity about the general problem of air pollution and the different methods of dealing with it may be desirable, together with any information about the authority's future programmed''. The Public Health Cbmmittee decided to hold a Clean Air Exhibition for one week at the Town Hall (Concert Hall) from October 28th to November 2nd and, in addition to the normal methods of advertising the exhibition by posters and press announcements, to issue an invitation card to all householders in the first Smoke Control Area. These invitation cards took the form of a folded leaflet, the front of the leaflet bearing the following design:- 67 They were distributed to the householders by members of a local boy scout troop. The co operation of scouts in matters of this kind has always been forthcoming and is very greatly appreciated. His Worship The Mayor of Fulham, Councillor David Shopland, B. A., J. P., opened the Exhibition and the principal exhibitors, in addition to the Public Health Department, were as follows:- Name of Exhibitor Exhibit Coal Utilisation Council Solid Smokeless Fuels and Appliances London Cbunty Cbuncil Fire Accident Prevention London Electricity Board Appliances National Smoke Abatement Society (Now known as the National Society for clean Air) Photographs and Exhibits of the effects of Air Pollution North Thames Gas Board Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation Appliances Set of Boards prepared from the Beaver Committee Report showing the effects of atmospheric pollution. In addition there was a working model showing how fogs are formed and dispersed, loaned from the Meteorological Office, and a display of oil-burning appliances. The floral decorations were supplied by courtesy of the Borough Surveyor's Department and the structural work of assembling the exhibition was done by the Borough Architect's Department The Exhibition was open from Monday, 28th October to Saturday 2nd November, and throughout the week two films, loaned by the Gas Council, "Guilty Chimneys'' and 'New King Coke'', were shown on a back projection film unit hired from Messrs. Sound Services Ltd. The local schools were advised of the Exhibition through the Divisional Education Officer, and several of them took the opportunity to send children along and al so to obtain copies of the posters and literature distributed in connection with the Exhibition. It was also well reported and advertised in the local papers. A total of 1,317 persons attended the Exhibition. FULHAM MORTUARY Following the rescinding of the rule, in May 1956, that hospitals had to notify the Coroner of any deaths occurring within 24 hours of admission to the hospital providing they were satisfied that the cause of death was "naturalthere has been a marked decrease in the number of post mortem examinations. In April, following the retirement of one of the pathologists, the Coroner for the West London District.. Mr. Gavin Thurston, notified the Council that he intended to discontinue the use of the Flilham Mortuaiy for medico legal autopsies and to centralise the work at the Hammersmith Mortuaiy. The Council decided, however, that the Mortuaiy should continue to remain in use to accommodate the convenience cases, i.e., those put in by undertakers before interment, and to vary the duties of Mr. Churchill, the Mortuary Keeper, so that he attends at the Mortuaiy each day, to allow convenience cases to be taken in or out and to keep the place clean after which his services have been used as an Ehquiry Officer on the surveys of smoke control areas. 68 The following cases were dealt with during the year:- Number of post mortems carried out by order of the Coroner 19 Number of convenience cases 95 Total 114 The following figures for the last five years illustrate the decrease in the wo rk:- Cases: 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 Post-Mortems 299 242 223 153 19 Convenience Cases 168 149 76 89 95 Totals 467 391 299 242 104 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 19 48 Section 50 - Burial or Cremation of the Dead: 8 Funerals (7 Adults and 1 child) were arranged under the provisions of this Section of the Act. Details of the cost of the burials are as follows:- £ s. d. *8 Funerals as per contract 110 14 6 62 Removals of bodies from river 4 10 0 115 4 6 Less amount recovered from estate of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives traced 60 8 6 Balance being cost to Council 54 16 0 * The cost of the funerals varies slightly, the average cost of an adult being approximately £15 8s, 0d. øThis charge relates to the recovery from the River Thames of the bodies of two persons taken by an Undertaker from Putney Pier to Hammersmith MortuaiyIt is this Council's liability to pay such charges as, although the persons concerned were not residents of Fulham, the bodies were taken from the river within the Borough boundary, and this is the place where it is assumed they died. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are seven Public Conveniences, each with a Mens and Womens Section, under the control of the Public Health Department, which have been constructed at various times between 1900 and 1939. All the conveniences have both a free and paid wash for the convenience of the public, the only exception being at Wfyfold Road, where there is a free wash only. These facilities are well used and appreciated. 69 Proposal to build a new convenience - Wandsworth Bridge Area: Owing to the continued restrictions on expenditure it has not been thought advisable to make any further approach to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for loan sanction to build this convenience on part of what was the site of Messrs. French's builder's yard. Ismailia Road. As soon as the financial climate becomes more favourable, another application will be submitted to the Ministry. Replacement of Gibb's Green Convenience: It is proposed to replace the old underground convenience at Gibbs Green with a modern convenience as soon as possible, and a suitable site near the existing convenience has been found. An approach to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for loan sanction to rebuild this convenience will be made as soon as the site is cleared and valued. It is hoped that work in building this new convenience will conmence before the end of 1958. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS During the year 92 medical examinations were carried out. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service, to determine their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme and of others referred because of sick leave or accident. The latter usually required specialist investigation and resulted in quite a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospital specialists. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 - THE POISON RULES PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941 The retail sale of poisonous substances by shopkeepers who are not registered pharmacists is controlled by the Acts and rules made thereunder The Poisons List, which has been prepared by the Poisons Board and confirmed by the Home Secretaiy, prescribes two Lists of Poisons - Part I and Part II. The sale of poisons included in Part I is restricted to registered pharmacists whilst those included in Part II may be sold to the general public not only by registered pharmacists, but also (subject to certain conditions) by ordinary traders whose names are entered on a List of Persons entitled to sell such poisons, kept by the Local Au tho ri ty. The Acts and Rules lay down certain requirements regarding type of container, labelling, storage, transport and sale of poisons, penalties being prescribed for non compliance. Pees are payable to the local authority by persons whose names are entered on the List. At the end of 1957 there were 155 names on the Council's List and the following changes took place in the Register during the year Number of listed sellers on Council s register at 1.1.57 156 Number added during the year 5 161 Number who transferred their business or discontinued the sale of poisons 6 Number on register at 31.12 57 155 78 Visits of inspection were made during the year under review. 70 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act, which came into operation on 1st April, 1952, regulates the sale of pet animals and empowers a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) to grant licences to keep a pet shop on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. During 1957, eleven licences were renewed and two new licences issued, appropriate conditions being applied to each. No contraventions of the Act were found during 55 routine inspections. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Under this Act it is unlawful in the course of business to use filling materials to which the Act applies in any form of upholstery, the stuffing or lining of toys, baby carriages or of articles of such other kinds as may be prescribed except on premises registered by a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough Council). Eight premises are registered in Fulham. During 1957 the following samples of filling materials were purchased fay the Sampling Officer and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of the Act:- Feathers 2 Horse Hair 3 Rag Flock 6 Coir fibre 4 Kapok 5 Kapok Mixture 1 Hair and Fibre mixture 1 Algerian Fibre 2 24 Two samples of filling materials submitted for examination were reported to be unsatisfactory. Reports on these samples are as follows:- One Sample of Kapok (No. 14) failed to satisfy the requirements of the Act, the trash content being 3.2 per cent., whereas the permitted maximum is 3.0 per cent. On the recommendation of the Public Health Committee the result of the analysis was communicated to the manufacturers. Sample No. 18 consisted of a bolster, the contents of which were described by the retailer as horse hair. The analyst, however, reported that the filling consisted of coir fibre which satisfied the legal requirements, although the contents had of course been misdescribed. On enquiry it. was ascertained that the bolster was one of a consignment of ex-Government stock which, according to the retailer, were described as horse hair filled and many of the bolsters examined in the shop did, in fact, contain hair. The retailer agreed to exercise greater care in future when applying a description to such articles.
