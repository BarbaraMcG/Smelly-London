Dear Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my twenty. sixth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1912. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough has been good. There has been a small amount of infectious disease which has been generally of a mild type. Enteric Fever still continues to decline both in the number of cases and in its fatality. The year has been marked by the coming into operation of the Insurance Act. A large amount of work in the latter part of the year was done in assisting the Insurance Committee both in arranging for the medical treatment of insured persons privately, and in providing a Tuberculin Dispensary where more than a hundred patients were attended to. The Tuberculin treatment with the examination of Phthisis contacts took up the time of the Medical Officer of Health for at least two whole days a week. The death rate cannot be considered unduly high for a working class population. The examination of foodstuffs, landed at the river bank and arriving from inland, has been well carried out especially by the officer whose whole time is devoted to this work. Good work has been done by the Inspectors under the Public Health (London) Act, and under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act. I have to thank the staff under me for their ready assistance and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS.

We sometimes forget that London is a large manufacturing centre, the largest indeed in the world. It does not concern itself so much as our northern capitals with the working up of raw materials, but uses chiefly, partly manufactured articles. Southwark is essentially a manufacturing borough and is getting more and more so every year. There is hardly a business of any kind which is not well represented in the district. It is both a rich and a poor borough, rich in its trade, but poor in its inhabitants. On the latter account it is not likely, in the future, to be able to boast of its low death.rate. In my opinion the Public Health Authority of Southwark for many years past, has had much to be proud of in the district's comparatively low death.rate, and its freedom from infectious disease. It must be confessed, however, that some portions of the borough are very old and dilapidated. Some of this old worn out part will be demolished when the approach to the new bridge is made. I am sorry to see the Tabard Street clearance scheme progressing so slowly, it is not likely to be finished in our generation, unless a little more energy is put into the work.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1912 was 5,254, of which 2,748 were males, and 2,506 females. This represents a birth.rate of 27,6 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 3,202; St. George the Martyr, 1,526; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 526. Of the 5,254 births registered in the borough 49 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the borough. 384 births occurring in various lying.in and other institutions outside 5 the borough but belonging to Southwark parents were notified to me by the Registrar.General. When the 49 "outward" transfers are deducted and the 384 "inward" transfers are added to the 5,254 births actually registered in the borough the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 5,589. This gives a corrected birth.rate of 29.4. Birth.rate for the last Twenty.two Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George. Christchurch and St. Saviour.

Of the 2,607 deaths registered in the sub.districts of the Borough, 1,047 occurred in the Poor.Law Institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 375 belonging to Southwark, and 696 to other sanitary districts. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,279. Of this very large number, as many as 729 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died in the large public hospitals. When those persons who were non.parishoners, but who died in our Borough have been deducted, and the outlying deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,190, of which number 1,703 were males, and 1,487 females. The death.rate when calculated on this " corrected " number is 16.8 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1,912, as against a rate of 18.4 for 1911. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 40.1. TABLE 3. Out.lying Deaths, with Localities Males. Females. Total.

Report of Public Health Committee to the Council. Establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary in the Borough. Your Committee have to report that they have again considered the question of the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary in the Borough. The Medical Officer of Health in a report presented to the Committee in October last pointed out that the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis is the most important part and the groundwork of preventive medicine; that measures which are successful in diminishing the spread of tuberculosis are, at the same time, successful in preventing the spread of other diseases. The more the subject of tuberculosis is studied, the more is it seen that this disease is responsible for many other diseases of the body, which, until lately, were thought to have an entirely different origin. It is therefore clear that tuberculosis must be attacked with vigour and with the cry of "no quarter." Possessed of this belief the framers of the National Insurance Act made the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis a very important, and indeed, vital principle of that Act. The Local Government Board in elaborating the steps to be taken under the Act, has expressed the opinion that each London borough with a population of 150,000 should have within its area at least one dispensary for the treatment of tuberculosis. The object of a tuberculosis dispensary is (a) for the treatment of tuberculosis, in cases chiefly in the early stage of the disease, when the patient can be treated successfully at home, without the necessity of either discontinuing his work, or going into a sanatorium. The treatment at the dispensary to extend to all persons, whether insured or uninsured in the borough, suffering from tuberculosis, and to embrace any method offering the best result in regard to arrest or cure of the disease. (b) To act as a clearing house in connection with the home, the general hospitals and dispensaries, and the sanatoria. (c) To act as a means for the better special education of local medical men in the treatment of tuberculosis. The medical practitioners of the borough to be given opportunities of attending without fee 62 the practice of the dispensary on days appointed by the Dispensary Administrative Committee. The chief points in the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary are:— (l) That, as the health portion of the work is equally as important as the clinical, the Medical Officer of Health and the Tuberculosis Officer should attend the meetings of the Dispensary Administrative Committee. (2) That while the Tuberculosis Officer should act independently clinically, his work in respect to health matters should be under the control and supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. (3) That the Tuberculosis Officer to be appointed be the head of the Dispensary, that he be specially trained in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, and that his services be available both for treating cases at the Dispensary and as a consultant. He shall act as Medical Adviser to the Insurance Committee for purposes of Sanatorium benefit, on terms to be agreed on between the Council and the Insurance Committee, and he shall not engage in private general practice. (4) That as the advice to be given to the Insurance mittee is both clinical and hygienic, the Medical Officer of Health and the Tuberculosis Officer should act as final advisers in regard to Sanatoria benefits. The staff required to work the Dispensary and the approximate cost per annum is as follows, viz.:— £ S. d. The Medical Officer of Health as Chief Executive and Organising Officer - The Tuberculosis Officer 500 0 0 Secretary and Dispenser 100 0 0 Two nurses at £80 each 160 0 0 Caretaker 52 0 0 Drugs and Medicines 140 0 0 Rent, Rates and Taxes 150 0 0 Incidental Expenses 50 0 0 £1,152 0 0 63 The Medical Officer of Health has informed your Committee that it has been stated by the Assistant Secretary of the Local Government Board that so far as insured persons are concerned, a local authority running the scheme of institutional treatment would receive the actual expenditure on the insured persons, which would be one-third of the total population suffering from Tuberculosis. Then with regard to the remaining two-thirds of the population suffering from Tuberculosis the Local Government Board would be willing to pay one-half the cost if the local authority would pay the other half. This amounts, therefore, to two-thirds of the cost of the scheme being borne by the Local Government Board and the Insurance Committee, and one-third by the local authority, so that should the annual cost amount to £1,152 the cost to Southwark would be approximately £384. The payment of four-fifths of the cost of establishing a Tuberculosis Dispensary would also be borne by the Local Government Board. The Dispensary would be called "The Southwark Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption," and would be owned by the Borough Council and administered by a Special Sub-Committee of the Public Health and Sanitary Committee, to which shall be added six other persons by co-option. It is thought that at the present time there are in the Borough 1,000 insured persons suffering from tuberculosis, which number would most likely give a dispensary yearly clientele of 500. Your Committee have ascertained that in 15 of the Metropolitan Borough Councils a Tuberculosis Dispensary has been established, and has been in working order for some time, and that in 7 other Boroughs the question is under consideration. The proposal which is now submitted to the Council has received the earnest consideration of the Committee, and many meetings have been held to settle the details. They now Recommend — (a) That a Tuberculosis Dispensary be established in the Borough of Southwark. [Adopted 64 (b) That the Dispensary be administered by the Public Health and Sanitary Committee, through the medium of a SubCommittee of that Committee, to which shall be added six other persons to he co-opted thereon by the Council. [Adopted (c) That Dr. G. B Millson, the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough,'be appointed Chief Executive and Organising Officer of the ProPosed Dispensary. [Adopted (d) That a Tuberculosis Officer be appointed at a salary of £500 per annum as Head of the Dispensary. [Adopted (e) That the following scheme of staffing, &c., the Dispensary be approved and adopted, viz.:— (i.) Secretary and Dispenser £100 per annum, (ii.) Two Nurses, at £80 each £160 ,, (iii.) Caretaker £52 ,, (iv.) Drugs and Medicine £140 ,, (v.) Bent, Rates and Taxes £150 ,, (vi.) Incidental expenses £50 ,, [Adopted Site of Proposed Dispensary. Acting on the assumption that the foregoing proposal will meet with the approval of and be sanctioned by the Council, the Committee have considered the question as to a site for a Dispensary. A site in some central and convenient position in the Borough should, it is felt, be selected, and your Committee have deputed a Sub-Committee to make inquiries. A further report on the matter will be submitted to the Council in due course. Recommendations 9(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), were carried unanimously in the Council. 65 TUBERCULIN DISPENSARY. (provisional). This Dispensary commenced work on October 24th, 1912. 158 patients have been treated up to the 31st May, 1913. Of these 158 patients, 72 (the records of whom are appended to this report) were treated for longer or shorter periods with Tuberculin; 57 were also treated with Tuberculin for a very short period, but could not continue the treatment for various reasons stated below, whilst 29 were attended at the request of the Insurance Committee—no Tuberculin being used in these last cases. In regard to the 72 recorded cases, I have to report as to the state of the disease and the physical condition of the patients, that on May 31st, 21 cases had much improved, all having returned to work; 5 had much improved, but had not resumed work; 14 were improved; 5 had not improved; 2 had died; 2 were found not to be Tuberculous; 11 had left the district, having gone to a sanatorium or having ceased to attend; whilst 12 cases are too recent to report upon. Of these (72) cases 34 males and 11 females were insured, whilst 18 males and 9 females were not insured. 1,254 injections of Tuberculin were given. In regard to the 57 cases examined in which injections of Tuberculin were given for brief periods, 27 males and 7 females were not insured, whilst 17 males and 6 females were insured. The following were the reasons in the 57 cases for ceasing to attend the Dispensary: —6 went into the workhouse on account of being destitute, 4 went into the country, 7 to sanatoria, 1 to own doctor, 7 refused treatment, 12 ceased to attend without giving a reason, 6 removed to another district, 6 were too ill to be treated, 3 were found not suffering from the disease, whilst 5 were refused treatment as they were attending a hospital. In these cases 179 injections of Tuberculin were given. The time given to the work of the Dispensary by the Medical Officer of Health, who carried out the work, was two hours each morning and evening on Tuesdays and Fridays. No application for treatment was refused. The utmost capacity of the present Dispensary has now been reached. The number of patients seen daily has been from 35 to 40. 66 67 TABLE 31.

No case of the disease was notified during the year. Deaths from Small-pox during the last ten years:— 1903 — 1908 — 1904 1 1909 — 1905 — 1910 — 1906 — 1911 — 1907 — 1912 — SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the borough were 6 during 1912, as against 6, 9, 14, 24 and 35, for the preceding five years. The old order of things during the last few years has completely changed. The usual cycle of incidence of the disease has disappeared and we can no longer count upon years when the complaint will be mild or severe. The mortality from Scarlet Fever is simply vanishing. The year under consideration and last year show the smallest number of deaths in this district since any record was published. 500 cases of Scarlet Fever, or of diseases simulating Scarlet Fever, were notified to me during 1912. This shows that the complaint has become much less dangerous as the number of cases notified has not diminished in the same proportion as the deaths during the last few years. It must, therefore, be said that the type of the disease is changing. This change must in a large measure be due to the better housing of the people, as the cumulative effect in years gone by of the poison in overcrowded rooms was seen to be so deadly. No particular outbreak needs mention as the cases were pretty evenly distributed throughout the district. It only remains to be stated that all the cases were carefully inquired into and directions given. Contacts were also duly notified to other boroughs. The total number of cases notified was 500, as against 480 for 1911. the percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 1.2. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.03. 78 The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was :— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 493 cases sent to hospital numbered 4, a mortality of 0.8 per cent. In the 7 cases treated at home, there were 2 deaths, a percentage of 28.5. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. DIPHTHERIA. There has been as in recent years a small amount of the disease in the borough. The incidence of the disease has been singularly even in the various wards. No outbreak of any importance has to be recorded. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup was 284, as against 293 for last year. 79 The deaths from the disease numbered 27, as against 30 for 1911. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 9.5. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.14. The number of cases notified as compared with London, during the last ten years was :— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The Wards most affected were St. Mary, Trinity and St. Michael's, in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever in the borough during the year numbered 4, as against 5, 7 and 6, in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 39 for the present year, and 45, 54 and 35, for the three preceding years. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 10.3. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.02. 80 The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1903 122 1908 48 1904 92 1909 35 1905 74 1910 54 1906 111 1911 45 1907 80 1912 39 The number of deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years :— 1903 23 1908 7 1904 18 1909 6 1905 11 1910 7 1906 21 1911 5 1907 11 1912 14 Of the 39 cases notified as many as 37 were removed to hospital, of which 3 died, a mortality of 8.1 per cent. In the 2 cases treated at home 1 died. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 95.0. MEASLES. The fatality of this disease in the year under consideration has again been very high. Not so high, however, as in the year 1910, when the death-toll reached the unprecedented figure of 229, but enough to call attention to the urgent need there is in the poorer districts of the Metropolis for a larger staff of Municipal nurses to direct the work of saving the children. This endemic disease, with the exception of Phthisis, is usually the most fatal of all the infectious diseases. Like Phthisis it is exceptionally fatal in the poorer districts, and can be largely influenced in its course by all those social conditions which tend to the better housing of the poor. The fatality of Measles is usually in the inverse proportion to the cubic capacity of the room in which the patient is treated. The death-rate per 100 living was 0.71. The Wards chiefly affected were St. George's, St. John's and St. Michael's, in the order named. 81 Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1903 83 1908 77 1904 191 1909 127 1905 154 1910 225 1906 95 1911 120 1907 112 1912 139 WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 49 for the year. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.26. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1903 68 1908 50 1904 118 1909 57 1905 80 1910 60 1906 54 1911 64 1907 103 1912 49 CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER. During the year 8 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified of which 6 died. 6 cases of Polio-Myelitis and one of Polio Encephalitis were also notified. Of the former none died, of the latter one died. DIARRHÆA. The cold wet summer of 1912, was largely responsible for the comparatively small number of deaths from Diarrhaea recorded in the year. It would appear that no particular kind of weather is suitable for every disease, especially during the months of July and August. Last year being cold and wet, Rheumatism and Rheumatoid Arthritis were particularly prevalent, whilst many forms of infectious disease were distinctly less. It is therefore a comfort to know when the Summer is dull and dreary that the weather is doing good to somebody. Although the weather was favourable for the prevention of Diarrhæa, all the usual precautions, I have mentioned for years past, were taken, 82 All the cases were visited and inquired into. Breast feeding of babies was recommended by circularising and visiting as usual. In the poorer parts of the borough the leaflet "Precautions to be taken to prevent Summer Diarrhæa'' was widely distributed. The annual death-rate from Diarrhæa per 1,000 living was 0.50. Deaths from diarrhæa during the last ten years:— 1903 197 1908 188 1904 282 1909 113 1905 183 1910 90 1906 225 1911 331 1907 101 1912 95 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. TABLE 33.

The total number of rooms treated during the year by the Council's disinfecting staff was 7,060. Of this number 1,164 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 1,252 rooms in 1911. 4,249 rooms were periodically sprayed and otherwise treated in connection with cases of Phthisis notified under the Tuberculosis Regulations of 1908 and 1911. 1,647 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year, as against 1,296 in 1911. Of the total number of rooms disinfected (7,060) it was found necessary to strip 906 rooms. Of these 531 were in relation to the notifiable diseases, 357 after the termination of cases of Phthisis, and 18 were verminous. TABLE 35. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected.

During the year 1,444 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street, as against 155 persons cleansed during the year 1911. Our Council entered into an agreement for the cleansing of school children with the London County Council, whereby the payment of a capitation fee was guaranteed. Under this agreement 1,351 children were cleansed, as against 18 cleansed during 1911. It was found necessary in a large number of cases to treat the children twice and sometimes three or four times before they were found to be effectually cleansed. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 93 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 137 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1911 TABLE 40.

The question of the duties and districts of the women sanitary inspectors came before the Public Health Committee on several occasions. The following extracts taken from the Council's Minutes will show the arrangement for working finally arrived at:— Extract from Council's Minutes of 20th December, 1911. Women Sanitary Inspectors. Your Committee have to report that they have had under their consideration the question with regard to the Women Sanitary Inspectors. The Council will no doubt remember that at its meeting on the 12th April, 1911, a scheme was adopted whereby Miss Blackwell, Woman Sanitary Inspector, was allocated the duties of supervising the whole of the houses in the Borough registered as houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and the second Woman Inspector, Miss Wilkinson, was appointed to take over the duty of looking after the infants. Your Committee now feel that this arrangement does not work satisfactorily, and they are strongly of opinion that by reverting to the scheme of dividing the Borough into two districts, and giving each Woman Inspector a district so that she would supervise the houses registered as houses let in lodgings, and be responsible for looking after the infants in addition to her general sanitary work in the district, the work would be more efficiently performed. They accordingly Recommend— (a) That the resolution of the Council of the 12th April, 1911, appointing one Woman Inspector to supervise the whole of the houses registered as houses let in lodgings, and the other Woman Inspector to take over the duty of looking after the infants, be rescinded. (b) That for the purpose of the work of the Women Sanitary Inspectors, the Borough be divided into two districts, and that each Woman Inspector supervise the houses registered as houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and look after the infants in addition to her other sanitary duties in each district. 104 (c) That Miss H. Blackwell and Miss C. G. Wilkinson, the two Women Sanitary Inspectors, be also appointed as Health Visitors under the Health Visitors (London) Order, 1909, and that a salary of £10 per annum (being a proportionate part of the salary now paid to them) be assigned to each Inspector for performing the duties of Health Visitor. (d) That application be made to the Local Government Board for their sanction to these appointments. Miss Blackwell resigning her appointment in March, 1912, the following further consideration of the matter took place:— Extract from Council's Minutes of 15th May, 1912:— Women Sanitary Inspectors. The Council will no doubt remember that at its meeting on the 13th March last, the Committee reported the receipt of a communication from the Assistant Secretary of the Local Government Board stating that the Board were advised that the arrangements proposed by the Council for the discharge of the duties of female Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor in the Borough were not satisfactory, and that they would instruct one of their Medical Inspectors to confer with representatives of the Council and with the Medical Officer of Health in regard to the matter. Dr. Richard J. Beece, Medical Inspector of the Local Government Board accordingly attended at the Town Hall on March 12th, and met the representatives of the Borough Council, when the whole matter was gone into and the information in support of the Council's arrangements was placed before the Inspector. Your Committee have now received a communication from the Local Government Board to the effect that the Board had considered the report of Dr. Beece, which confirmed them in their opinion that it would be impracticable for the two female Inspectors to discharge adequately the duties of Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor which it was proposed they should undertake. The work entailed in the inspection of houses let in lodgings would, as the Board were advised, occupy in itself the whole time of the two officers, while the duties of Health Visitor, if adequately discharged, would require at the least the whole time of one officer. Further stating that in the Board's view the Borough Council should appoint a Health Visitor who would devote her whole time to the 105 duties of that office, and asking that the matter might be taken into further consideration. A Sub-Committee was appointed to consider the letter, who report that there are at the present time in the Borough about 1,200 houses on the Register of houses let in lodgings apportioned to the various wards as follows:—St. Mary's 33, St. Paul's 42, Trinity 66, St. John's 50, St. Peter's 44, All Saints' District 128, St. Michael's 314, St. Jude's 75, St. George's 364, Christchurch 82 and St. Saviour's 72. The Medical Officer of Health states that each Woman Inspector can inspect 25 houses per day, or 150 per week, and that it is necessary these houses should be visited at least once a month. Having considered the number of houses let in lodgings in each Ward your Committee considered a suggestion that the inspection of a number of these houses should in future be undertaken by the Ward Inspectors, thereby obviating the necessity for the appointment of a second Woman Inspector, the vacancy now pending by the resignation of Miss Blackwell being filled by the appointment of a Health Visitor. The Medical Officer of Health following out a suggestion on the part of the Committee, advised that 600 of the houses let in lodgings should be allocated to Miss Wilkinson, the present Woman Inspector, and the remainder to the men, and he has expressed the opinion that this arrangement could be worked efficiently with the present staff. Your Committee are of opinion that the suggestion now put forward is one which will commend itself to the Council. The efficiency of the Department will, it is hoped, be maintained without any increase of the existing staff. They Recommend— (a) That in future Miss Wilkinson, Woman Sanitary Inspector, be required to supervise the inspection of about 600 houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and that the remainder of the houses on the Register be allocated to the Ward Inspectors. [Adopted (b) That in lieu of advertising for a Woman Sanitary Inspector in the place of Miss Blaekwell, a Health Visitor be appointed, and that it be referred to the Establishment 106 Committee to take the necessary steps to advertise the appointment. This arrangement was confirmed at a later meeting of the Council:— Extract from Council's Minutes of 17th July, 1912. Woman Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor. The Council will no doubt remember that at its meeting on the 15th May last, the Committee submitted a full report upon the question with regard to the discharge of the duties of Woman Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor in the Borough, and recommended— (a) That, in future, Miss Wilkinson, Woman Sanitary Inspector, be required to supervise the inspection of about 600 houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and that the remainder of the houses on the register be allocated to the Ward Inspectors. (b) That in lieu of advertising for a Woman Sanitary Inspector in the place of Miss Blackwell, a Health Visitor be appointed. . . . These arrangements were reported to the Local Government Board for confirmation, and a communication has now been received from the Board approving of the proposals. The Committee feel that the Council is to be congratulated that this difficult question has now been satisfactorily settled. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. During the year 1912 no new houses were placed upon the Register. Seven houses were removed from the Register as follows:— Nos. 9 and 10, Stanford Place, by resolution of the Council on 27th November, 1912, an application having been received from the owners, who stated that the houses in question were now occupied by separate families. Nos. 1 and 2 Crown Cottages, and Nos. 38, 10 and 44, Gravel Lane : premises pulled down. At the end of the year 1912 the number of houses upon the Register was 1229.
