LAMMAS RIGHTS. On the 28th June, 1888, Mr. Birkett attended before the Lammas Rights Committee and consulted with the Committee as to their requirements, it was resolved that Mr. Birkett be instructed to investigate the position of the Vestry in the matter of the Lammas Rights, and give the Vestry as full and exhaustive a history and opinion as he could for the sum of £50. Mr. Birkett not having furnished his report in time to lay before the meeting of the Committee held on the 18th of October, 1888, the Clerk was directed to request Mr. Birkett to furnish his report as far as he had gone, to the Committee, that day week. On the 7th of February, 1889, Mr. Birkett presented and read 16 his report to the Lammas Rights Committee, when it was resolved that the report be received and further considered, and that the Committee do adjourn until that day week at 7 p.m., Mr. Birkett keeping the report in his custody till that date. On the latter day it was resolved that Mr. Birkett do deliver his report to the Vestry at the meeting to be held on Wednesday, the 20th February, and at the Vestry meeting held on the said 20th of February, the Chairman stated that Mr. Birkett had submitted his report, when it was resolved that the Vestry at its rising do adjourn until Wednesday, February 27th, 1889, at 7 p.m. to consider the report in Committee. At the Committee of the whole Vestry held on Wednesday, 27th February, 1889, it was, after considerable discussion, resolved" that Mr. Birkett's report be printed and circulated amongst the members of the Vestry only, to be marked " Private and Confidential." THE TOWN MEADOWS OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM. Report to the Lammas Rights Committee of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Gentlemen, It will be in the recollection of the Committee, that it gave me instructions to investigate the position of the Vestry with respect to the question of the existence of Lammas Rights within the Parish of Fulham, and to furnish the Vestry with us full and exhausti\e a history as possible of any such Rights, and an opinion within certain limits fixed by the Committee. I now have the pleasure of submitting a Report prepared in conformity with such instructions. object of I gather that the object which the Vestry has in view, is the the Report. provision of open spaces for tho Parish, by taking steps to establish Rights of Common over the Town Meadows, and then by acquiring them, or by receiving in some form or other compensation for extinguishment of such Rights, in order to devote the proceeds to the acquisition of open spaces else where. I am happy to be able to report that the facts, as they have so far been presented to me, are favorable to the attainment of the object of the Vestry. Lands in The lands in question lie by the side of the River Thames, and question. comprise altogether about 77 acres. The western or inland boundary is an irregular line coinciding with an ancient ditch and bank still to be seen. The present situation and sub-divisions of the land are approximately shown upon the Ordnance Map of the scale of 1-2500th, which accompanies this Report. the green color upon this plan represents the land popularly believed to be subject to Rights of Common of Pasture or Lammas Rights, the black figures and lines are taken from the map annexed to the Tithe Apportionment Award for the Parish, and the figures correspond with Schedule I. to this Report, which is copied from the Tithe Apportionment Award. The red lines show the present ownership and occupation of the lands, and the red figures correspond with Schedule II. to this Report. The red figuring and Schedule II. have been prepared at my request by the Surveyor to the Vestry. 17 It will be observed on reading the Schedules that the modern names of the several pieces of land forming the strip are Jackson's Mead, Charley Mead Town Mead. Frog Mead, Fan Mead, Lonsdale Mead, and Dock Mead. Lonsdale Mead is sometimes called Elm Tree Mead. Enquiries conducted. The principal enquiries which are necessary in Questions fecting Rights of Common are:- (1.) What has been the user upon the land in question from time immemorial, as evidenced by the oral information of the oldest living persons ? (2.) What is the history of the land upon which such user has taken place ? (3.) Wnetherthe testimony of living persons is borne out or contradicted by documentary evidence ? In making these enquires I have taken the testimony of some , fourteen of the oldest persons I could discover. I have had a general search made among the Public Records. I have cursorily examined the Records in the Parish Church, and in the possession of the Veslrj', the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Steward of the Manor of Fulham, and some few documents in th.3 possession of private individuals. The Public Records and Court Rolls of the Manor are very voluminous and extend from about the year A.D. 1066 to the present time. Resuit of oral evidence, The modern oral evidence amounts to this—that during the whole time of living memory the owners and occupiers of lands and houses situated within the Parish of Fwlham, who have owned cows or horses, have been accustomed, at their free will and pleasure, to depasture their beasts on the lands in question from Lammas Day until the 13th February without interruption, until the enclosure of some of the lands by the Railway and Gas Companies and others. All the witnesses agree as to the boundaries of the lands, theugh there seems some little question in respect to Elm Tree Mead. Most of them have heard the lands spoken of at times as "Fulham Marsh," or The Marshes," and some believe or assert that the right was limited in one way or another. The persons who have as a matter of fact been accustomed to depasture the Town Meadows have been principally cow keepers or dairymen not necessarily owning or occupying any lands, but merely owning or occupying a house and yard or a house and stables. The evidence seems clear that nobody, except persons occupying lands or houses in the Parish of Fulham, were knowingly permitted to turn their cattle into the Town Meadows, and these practices appear to have obtained in respect of the Commons and other Lammas Lands in the Parish. In addition to the evidence of usor there is evidence that an occupier of some of these lands brought an action to prevent this depasturing of the lands in his occupation, but acting on legal advice he abandoned his action as futile. The oral evidence, however, requires to be strengthened and to be carefully worked up, but I have no doubt that there is a further considerable bulk to be obtained. Result of his- Speaking generally, and subject to anything which may documentary transpire or be discovered upon a closer examination of the evidence. documents, there is nothing in the documentary evidence C 18 negativing or inconsistent with the oral evidence, bat while there is a large volume of evidence relating to Eights of Common in the Parish generally, there is not a very large amount relating specifically to the lown Meadows. Accordino- to a statement in Faulkner's History of Hulham, the Manor was granted by Tyrhtilus, Bishop, of Hereford, to Erkenwald, Bishop of London, A.D. 691, but it is sufficient, witheut going into such questionable antiquity, to know as an incontrovertible fact that, previously to the Norman Conquest, this Manor formed part of the possessions of the See of London, and has continued to be held by the successive Bishops of London, with the exception of a slight interval during the troublous times of the Commonwealth, until the 30th December, 1808, upon which day the Manor became vested in the Ecclesiastical Commisioners for England by virtue of certain Acts of Parliament relating to the Commissioners. Thus we have a case which is not very frequently met with of a Manor not having been the subject of frequent seizure and grant by the Crown. There, can be but little doubt that the Manor in the early part of the present century was in much the same state as regards area and system of cultivation as prevailed 800 years before, so that if it can be shown by the documents that the customs which living witnesses say they know have been practised, and indeed are practised now, have been in all probability practised for all time, the Courts of Law will put some interpretation upon such ancient usage, and will protect the persons entitled to the benefit of it. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners, in a somewhat recent action, claimed that the Manor has always extended, with a small exception, over the whole of the old Ecclesiastical Parish of Fulham, and this is most likely correct, for as is well known, Wormwood Scrubbs at the North ; Walham Green, the Town Meadows, and the Bishop's Palace skirting the East and South; Starch Green on the West; and the Common Fields, Eelbrook Common, Shepherds Bush and Brook Green, dotted about the Parish, were all within the Manor. Accepting this view as correct, a fair notion of the state of things at the time of the Conquest, A.D. 1066, may be gathered from the Domesday Survey. That wonderful Survey details in the language of the day the state of cultivation, the number of the tenants, and occupiers of the land. This Survey supports the view that with a small exception the whole Parish was included within the Manor, and consequently the owners and occupiers of all lands in the Manor were inhabitants of the Parish and vice versa. The exception in Domesday Book is some land held by the Canons of St. Paul. At the date of the Conquest, then, a little over 800 years ago, the lands in the Parish were (except as above) held and occupied, as follows: The Bishop held in his own hands a large tract of land, a considerable free Tenants, and a further large acreage was held by villain, the predecessors of the modern Copyholders, while the remamcler, and. this is very important, was gTass land. These references to meadow and Pasture are of the wildest description, but taken with other statements in the Survey can, it seems, only bear ono interpretation, viz.: that the cultivators of the soil, that is the owners and occupiers of all lands and houses and in the Parish or Manor (except that of the Canons of St. Paul) were obliged to go or at any rate had a right to go to these meadows and pastures for the grazing of their beasts. 19 Haying thus found our earliest record in agreement with the statements of living witnesses, we will see whether in the intermediate period the evidence is as favorable. The principal points to bear in mind are:— (1) Is there evidence of the exercise of Lammas Eights of Pasture over any lands. (2) The identification of the lands subject to any such Eights and (3) Who are the persons entitled to exercise the Eights. In olden times the expressions, land and common fields, usually had reference to Arable land; and the expressions, commons, meadow, mead or pasture, to grass land, and the wastes of the Manor. The first reference which can be attributed to the Town Meadows occurs in the Court Rolls in A.D. 1418, in the shape of a presentment, that the Lord of the Manor ought to mend Stanbrigge, leading to Fulham Mead. Stanley Bridge, which is no doubt a corruption of Stanbrigge, is close to lands belonging to the Gas Company, formerly part of the Town Meadows. In A.D. 1480, there is a presentment that John Cokerick put sheep upon the "Common callod the Marsh," to the common nuisance. In A.D. 1483, Thomas Foot put more horses than he ought upon the Common of the Lord's Tenants in Fulham Marsh. In A.D. 1508 and 1509, Common of Pasture of all the Lord's Tenants in the Common Fields is several times spoken of. In A.D. 1525, it is ordered that no inhabitant or other shall common in the Commons beyond his proper quantity, pointing to a stint or regulation as to the number each person might turn out. Iu A .D. 1541, an order is made by the Homage that between the 2nd February and 1st August, no Tenant shall keep any cattle on the fields, except upon their own lands. That amounts to saying that, between the 1st August, which according to the old style was Lammas Day, and the 2nd February they could do so. In the same year every Tenant in Charlow Mead is ordered to make a sufficient fence there according to his holding. That would mean each Tenant must erect a fence between his piece of land and the adjoining Common Field, so as to prevent cattle straying into the corn. On reference to Schedule I., it will seem that part of the Town Meadows is now known as Charley Meade. In A.D. 1545, a man is ordered to remove his dung which lay in the Highway leading to Town Meade. Here 344 years ago is a clear statement of the existence of land known as the Town Meade. In 1548, the Homage order that no Tenant, Customary or Free, shall common with more beasts than their proper number. In A.D. 1553, and again in 1560, persons having trees on either side of a lane leading from the Common Meade to Wandon (Walham) Green are ordered to lop them, and reference is made to the Lord's Meadow called Charlow Meadow. In 1566, persons inhabiting witheut the Parish, are forbidden to common in Wormholt Wood. In A.D. 1605, the persons having meadow ground in Charlow Meade are ordered by the Homage to scour the drain there, and to contribute to the making of a gate. All persons are forbidden to turn nogs into the Common Fields, Meadows, or Commons. There are numerous regulations and presentments about this period, frequently referring to the inhabitants of Fulham as being entitled to Eights of Common in the Common Fields, Commons and Meadows. 20 From A.D. 1611 to 1617 reference is made to the Commom Fields and Lammas" ground, showing that, the two terms were no doubt used intentionally to embrace the two different systems of cultivation, for instance: It is ordered . Item, that no man or woman within this Parish that soweth carrots or turnips' in the Common Fields, or upon any Lammas Grounds, nor any of them shall handle or hurt with dogs or otherwise any man's cattle after corn is carried out of the lields. 1612. Item, that no inhabitants within this Parish of Fulham shall at any time or times hereafter until harvest be all innod, "keep any kind of cattle in the Common Fields within this Parish of Fulham; or suffer their cattle to go into the Common Fields or Meads, whereby to spoil any man's corn or grass. 1615. Item, that all these persons or person that shall presume to put any cattle into any of our Commons before the accustomed times, that is to say into Wormwold Wood and Helbook, from Candlemas next until May eve, nor into our Common Fields nor Meadows until all our corn and hay be cut down and carried away out of the fields or meadows, shall forfeit, etc. 1617. Item, that all the Landholders of land in the Town Meadows shall scour their ditches and make drills for draining of the meadows before All Hallow Day (November 1st). Now it seems to me, that these entries place beyond doubt that there were in the Parish Meadow lands subject to what are popularly known as Lammas Eights of grazing, that is, a right of grazing the lands after the crop has been carried away, and there is somo evidence even if these entries stood alone, that the Town Meadows were among such Lammas Lands. It seems obvious that unless the community as a whole had an interest in Charley Meade and the Town Meadows, that the Homage would not have any jurisdiction to order them to bo drained or fenced; but any doubt upon the point seems to be cleared up by an ontry upon the lvolls, in A.D. 1678, of certain Orders or Bye-Laws of the Homage respecting the Commons and Common Fiells generally, among which this occurs: The Town Meades are to be laid opon after the first crop is off "witheut stint." Proceeding with the question of identity, Domesday Book (A.D. 1086) tells us that there was Meadow for 40 teams, which would probably be 320 beasts; in A.D. 1448 there is the reference to the Stanbridge leading to Fulham Mead; in A.D. 1483 we have the Fulham Marsh referred to as commonable; in A.D. 1541 the tenants of Charlow Mead were ordered to fence their land; in A.D. 1545 the Highway leading to Town Mead is mentioned; in AD. 1558 and 1560 the persons having lands abntting the Lane from the Common Meade to Walham Green are ordered to cut the trees,and Charlow Meade is again referred to. In A.D. 1605 persons having Meadow Ground in Charlow Meade are ordered to scour their ditches. In A.D. 1613 osiers in Charley Mead are ordered to be protected from cattle. In A-D. 1617 the landowners in the Town Meadowes are ordered to scour their ditches. 1647, William Powell, alias Iliuson, is admitted a Tenant of (1) Two parcels of Meadow and Osiers-one called the Owle Acre—both lying in the town Meade, and abutting upon the Thames on the south, and Lands called the Bandalands upon the North; (2) to a piece of Meadow, situate in Wild Mead, next the Thames; and (3) to three parcels of Meadow in Charley Meade. These entries are all from the Court Polls of the Manor, and leave but 21 little doubt upon the question of identity; but there are one or two old Records which have turned up which clench the matter. In A.D. 1613 an Action was brought by the Crown, which then held some lands in the Town Meadows, against another owner of land there who had pulled up stakes which had been pitched by the Crown's Tenant to divide the Crown's land from the remainder. The Attorney General, on behalf of the Crown, alleged that the Crown was the owner of two acres of Meadow, lying in a great Meadow called the Town Meadow of Fulliam, and had granted the two acres to a man who was bound by the terms of the Grant to enclose and divide the two acres, which he had done with stakes; that the Defendants, William and John Arnold, who had ground in the same Town Meadow, said that " there ought to be none there," and threatened to pull them all up, as it was " neither the use or custom there to pitch stakes in the said Meadow for the severance of the Meadow Ground and that the said Town Meadow was measured out by the line at the time of mowing the grass;" and then allegations followed as to a right-of-way to the Meadows. Evidence was taken in the Suit on the part of the Defendants. Several Witnesses said that the ancient way from the Town Meadows to the "Village of Fulham, which was always used, was over a Meadow called Bandelands, upon a Bank there. Persons who know this land are aware that to this day there is a Bank lying just to the north of two pieces of land called Bandeylands. One Witness in the Action said that the Defendant's Meadow " was a low marsh ground, as all the rest of the Meadow Grounds are, and overflown at every spring tide." It would be difficult to find a better description than this of the lands as they existed before the formation of the recent embankment. So far, then, we have ascertained the position of the Town Meadow, Charlow Meadow, Bandeylands, Wildmead, The Owl Acre, Fan Meadow, a nd we find that they are next the River Thames, and overflown at every spring tide. The Vestry is aware that for a great number of years the Churchwardens possessed two pieces of land in the Town Meadows called the Church Acres. An entry (if it can be used in evidence) made in the year 1622, in an old book of the Parish Benefactions, is of great importance. The Church Acres are there described as lying in the Common Meadow, commonly called the Town Meade. In A.D. 1843 the tithes for the Parish were commuted and apportioned, for which purpose a plan and terrier were made. This coming so long after the entries upon the Court Rolls, to which we have referred, is a valuable piece of evidence of identity, the terrier having probably been made witheut reference to the Court Rolls. The tithe map and terrier agree in many particulars with the names and boundaries found upon the Rolls, and, with the oral evidence which we have been able to collect, thus form the last link which binds the Domesday Book to the evidence of to-day. It is perfectly true that there is not, acre for acre, an ancient description of all the lands in question, but I think there is sufficient to enable a Court to decide, if necessary, that the whole—or, at any rate, a large part of the lands are Lammas Lands. Finally,—Who are entitled to enjoy the Rights ? Class entitled to Rights, It will have been observed that the term " the Common of the Lord's tenants/' used in the early Rolls has gradually changed -first, into "a11 the Lord's'tenants, free and customary," then the expressions "the inhabitants of the parish," "persons dwelling within the pans , 22 have crept in, shewing that the class of persons spoken of as the Inhabitants must mean the same class as the Lord's Tenants. Remembering the conclusion arrived at, that nearly the whole Parish is included in the Manor, it is obvious that all the holders of the lands and tenements in the Parish must at one time have held them of the Manor, and therefore, the owners and occupiers of all lands held of the Manor must be the Inhabitants of the Parish. Therefore, whether the claim is made in one form or the other the result is the same; but I shall refer again to this point. It would not be right to conclude my remarks upon the documentary evidence witheut making reference to the numerous papers which are in existence relating to previous enquiries respecting the Lammas Bights. The West London Extension Railway Company took a portion of the Town Meadows some 20 or more years ago, and the Company so far admitted the existence of Lammas Rights, that it put the Bishop of London under terms to pay the sum of £7.50 to anybody proving the existence of such Rights as Consideration Money for the acquisition of the Rights over the lands taken by the Company, and Messrs. Lee and Co.'s letteis of 13th June and 29tli September, 187G, admit this, as well as the Bishop's liability to pay it to the persons entitled to Lammas Rights. Those letters coupled with an admission made by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in their Action with the Metropolitan Board of Works, are almost conclusive evidence against the Lord of the Manor that the lands in question were subject to Lammas .rights. I have also had before me several other papers, all of which tend to prove the existence of the Rights claimed and their actual user. There are in Fulham, as is well known, several Commons, in the ordinary sense of the word, such as Wormwood Scrubbs, Eelbrook, and Shepherd's Bush; there were also large open Common Fields besides the open Common Meadows. Throughout the Court Rolls there is abundant evidence that, in early days, Rights of Common over the whole of these lands enumerated were exercised by one and the same class of persons, and that the right of pasture throughout all the Commonable Lands—whether wastes or open fields—and Meadows was the same, except that, in the case of the Common Fields and Meadows they were not commonable until after the crops were carried, and, finally that the exercise of the Rights was subject to such Bye-Laws and Regulations as the Homage of the Manor Courts from time to time prescribed. Having thus given a general idea of the evidence upon which I found it, 1 proceed to state the conclusions to which I have arrived. Opinion. In forming my opinion, I have not been unmindful that the learned Counsel (the present Mr. Justice Manisty) who successfully. led the plaintiffs in the great Epping Forest Suit has expressed an opinion upon the question before us. I am not prepared to differ with Mr. Manisty's opinion, and when it is borne in mind that he had far less material before him than I have, I have less hesitation in agreeing with it. I am of opinion (1) That the lands set out in Schedule I, and commonly snown as the Town Meadows, were—and such of them as have not been acquired by the Railway Company are still—Lammas Lands, subject to a Right of pasture after the removal of the annual crops. '2.) That the persons entitled to such rights are at least the Owners and Occupiers of a 11 Freehold and Copyhold lands and tenements within the Parish held of the Manor of Fulham. (3). That the enjoyment of the right is subject to such 23 regulations as to number of cattle and time of opening the meadows as the Homage oi the Manor Court shall from time to time prescribe (4) That the nature of the Right is at least a Right of Pasture for all cattle including horses-levant and couchant within the Manor, as appurtenant to the lands and tenements within the Parish held of the Manor. I have now dealt with the subject from two points of view—the historical and the evidence of user; hut it must not be theught that all the proper investigations have been made, or that all the evidence of user has been obtained, for with the limits placed upon me it would be impossible to do so ; but I have no reason to apprehend that further research will do ought but confirm and strengthen the evidence already disclosed and the opinion expressed. Difficulties of Cases There are, however, in this as in all cases of a kindred nature, difficulties which must be faced, if it is desired to fight the battle t out. The law on the subject is abstruse and intricate; the procedure in the Courts is tedious and costly ; witnesses will not live for ever, while it seems the user is every year becoming less, and, therefore, while the Vestry is determining upon the course it should take, it is better that it should know what difficulties it may expect to be raised, and how they will have to be met. Probable defences, It may be anticipated with a fair degree of certainty that the defences which will be raised in an action for establishing the Rights claimed will be—(1) That the lands never were subject to Lammas Rights. (2) That there has not been any user over them. (3) That if the lands are Lammas Lands the Rights have been abandoned. (4) That there is a custom to enclose them, and (5) That the Rights put forward are not known to the Law. Methed of treatment of problam defences. These are the stock defences which are invariably made, of course sometimes with omissions and variations to suit the particular case, but I do not think, with one exception, there need be much apprehension. The lands can be identified both by documentary and oral evidence ; the user it is true has been continuous but scant of late, nevertheless living witnesses, supported by documents, prove the existence of a right of pasture of some kind; while with respect to abandonment, that is a point that can only be dealt with at the trial, but I think it would fail. The two important questions are the last two : Whether there is a custom to enclose ? and, Whether the Right is known to the Law ? There is only one entry upon the rolls that I have found to support such a custom, but that was a presentment during the Commonwealth, after the Manor had been seized by the Parliamentary Commissioners, and was in the hands of a man who had purchased from them, but who ^\as subsequently ejected for want of a good title. All previous entries„ and there are several, distinctly negative the custom, and as " the life of a custom depends upon antiquity," the earlier entries would, I think, prevail. The last question will turn principally upon the oral evidence. Lammas Rights exercisable by the tenants of a Manor, and by Owners and Occupieis of lands in a Parish, are Rights known to the Law, and, therefore, the question is, whether the user proved can be referred to the existence of one or other of these Rights? At the same time, if there is clear and plenfiful evidence that the Owners and Occupiers of lands and tenements wit un the Parish have as a matter of fact during all the period of living memory exercised the Rights claimed, and such user cannot be refened Strictly to 24 one of the Rights I have named, the Court will, if it can, find a possible legal origin, and on this point I cannot do better than quote the best lawyer on the subject we have ever had. Dictum of the master of the Rolls. In an action respecting Lammas Rights, a claim ver y similar to this was put forward, and Sir George Jessel, the Master of the Rolls, said :— "Now it is not for me to say in what way the Plaintiffs will state their "case, nor is it for me to say what amendments (in their claim) may be "allowed, if necessary, at the trial of the Action, but I will say this, sp far "as I am concerned, that I entirely assent to what has fallen from eminent ''Judges, to the effect that where longcontinued user is proved of a beneficial "njoyment of Rights of this kind, the tribunal ought not to be astute to "destroy these valuable Rights on any technical notion that a legal origin "could not be attributed to them. It is the duty of the Judges, as far as "it is possible to do so, to attribute a legal origin to the actual exercise of "these Rights. But that is a duty which I think can only be discharged "on the trial of the action, when the Judge knows what the facts are, and "what the evidence really is on which he is called upon to adjudicate. It "seems to me that it is the duty of the Pleader to state what is undoubtedly "considered the legal right, and that it is the duty of the Judge at the trial "to ascertain whether the evidence supports that supposed legal right, or "can fairly be allowed to support some other legal right. In that case, of "course, subject to the rights of the Defendant, he would allow proper "amendments with that view." With tlie exception of the case I have referred to, no case in recent years in which Rights of Pasture over Lammas Lands was involved, has come before the Courts. All the well-known decisions have related to rights of Common over Manorial or Forest Wastes. Lammas Lands are not wastes, they are Common Meadow Land, the ownership of which is not necessarily in the Lord of the Manor, nor are they usually connected with the Manorial system, beyond that the lands may be held freely or by copy of Court Roll of the Manor. Lammas Meadow Lands, and the Common Fields are the relic of the Village Community system of Agriculture which was at one time prevalent over a large part of England. The legal problem, The problem, therefore, which presents itself in framing a claim in a case of this nature, is to bring the facts obviously pointing to a state of things antecedent to the Manorial system within the technical rules of pleadings which have arisen out of the latter system. It has been decided that parishioners and inhabitants cannot claim as such, because they are a body incapable of taking a grant, but if it is found that the practice has been for an inhabitant householder as such to turn his beasts on to the lands it becomes necessary to modify the fictions created by medisoval lawyers to reconcile facts with feudal theories, by other suggestions perhaps equally hypothetical, derived from the same system. To decide that immemorial usage is not evidence of some ancient right having been created, would be practically to deny justice to a large class of persons actually exercising it, and hence the obligation which the Courts recognise of finding a legal origin if it can, and of reconciling well-known facts with rules of law too well ascertained to be summarily set aside, but which have no doubt been adopted in deference rather to cherished theories than to historical truth, Position of the Vestry the Vestry, I understand, is the owner of certain freehold lands in the parish, upon part of which it is intended to erect a Vestry Hall, some leasehold land upon which Stables stand, and other freehold land in Munster Road, on which Stables are being erected. If my view as to the persons entitled to Lammas Eights is correct, the Vestry would be qualified to talce proceedings to establish these rights of course assuming that the Vestry has not been prejudiced bv former proceedings. If on further investigations it should be found that no land belonging to the Vestry was ever held of the Manor, the Vestry might not be entitled to such lights, and I should advise the Vestry if it wishes to contest the case, to acquire a piece of land which was or is undoubtedly held of the Manor. It there are difficulties in the way of this, the Vestry might claim in respect of its own property and arrange with some freehold or copyhold tenant of the Manor to join with it as Plaintiffs in an Action, the Vestry, of course taking upon itself the responsibility of the case. There must be a large number of tenants of the Manor, and I do not think there should be any difficulty in finding a gentleman imbued with sufficient public spirit to take the small trouble which such a step would involve. A member of the A estry who is a also nopyholder would be eminently a suitable co Plaintiff. The qustion for the Vestry from a Practical point of view To look now at the question from a practical and pecuniary point of viow. There are about GO acres of land, exclusive of the Railway Company's property, which are alleged to be subject to Lammas Rights. Judging by the price obtained for the Church Acres, namely, £1,750 for 1-a. 3-r. 0-p. these sixty acres must be worth £60,000. In the case of ordinary Common Lands, the value of the Commoner's interest upon enclosure is generally placed at 11-12ths to 14-15ths of the whole, but in the case of Lammas Lands, in which there is no element of building value to be taken into consideration. I should say the Commoner's interest would not be so large, for they only have the use of the land for half the year. I should think that their interest in such a case would be a little more than half. But in a ease where the total value of the land unencumbered would be largely increased by a high building value, I think the Commoner's interest would be increased, but not in a direct ratio. Value of Lamms Rights Commoner's interest is one of an obstructive nature, which prevents the building value being realized during the existence of the Rights, and therefore, altheugh the Commoners may only be entitled to half the agricultural value of the land, they would, I think, be entitled to at least nine-tenths of the value given by the building element. Assuming then that the agricultural value of the land is £200 per acre, the Lammas Rights would be worth £6,000. Assuming the value of the land for building purposes to be £1,000 per acre, the value of the building element is £800 per acre, or £18,000 for the whole, nine-tenths of which is £43,200, making the net value of the Lammas Rights £49,200, or very nearly £50,000 Question for Of course this is a point more for the opinion of a Surveyor Vestry. than of a Lawyer, but adopting it foi the present argument, the Parish, as a whole, is interested in the lands from a pecuniaiy point alone to the extent of £50,000, and the question for the Vestry to consider is, whether it would be justified in spending the Ratepayers' money with the view of making good that claim. In the event of total failure, the Ratepayers would possibly have to pay £2,000, and therefore it may be said is it worth risking £2,000 to make good a claim to £50,000. 26 Course for Vestry to take if futher procedined determied upon Should the Vestry decide to go further I venture to think the best course it could take would be to have some further evidence collected, and to submit the whole of the facts to a senior and junior Counsel, with instructions to settle statement of claim if they think there are reasonable grounds for anticipating success. Conclusion, In conclusion I feel it my duty to point out the extreme importance of preserving the contents of this Report absolutely secret.

At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 9th of January, 1889, it was resolved that letters be written to the Chelsea and Hammersmith Vestries inviting them to appoint seven members each to meet seven members of this Vestry, "at the Vestry Offices, Fulham," to discuss the advisability of continuing the Embankment from Chelsea along Fulham to Hammersmith, and that upon the assent of either the Chelsea or Hammersmith Vestry, it be an instruction to the clerk to the Vestry to call a meeting of the members elected,—Messrs. Lawrence, Cornwall, Hunt, Easton, Coodacre, Dyer, and Weatherley being appointed the seven members to represent this Vestry. The Clerk to the Vestry wrote to the Chelsea and Hammersmith Vestries accordingly, and at the Vestry meeting on the 23rd January, 1889, he produced replies from' these Vestries, the former stating they had referred this Vestry's letter to their Western Embankment Committee for consideration and report, and the latter that they had appointed seven members to meet the seven members from this Vestry. The Clerk having received another letter from the Chelsea Vestry stating they had appointed their Western Embankment Committee to confer with this and the Hammersmith Vestries hereon, a meeting was convened for Thursday, 21st February, 1889, at 7 p.m., when representatives from each Vestry attended, and Mr. Churchwarden Hunt, of Fulham, was elected Chairman of the Committee, and Mr. Brass of Chelsea, and Mr. J. H. Green of Hammersmith, were appointed Vice-Chairmen. The Clerk having read the minutes of the Vestry relating to the appointment of the Committee, and the Chairman having set forth the objects for which the Committee was appointed, it was resolved that this meeting, representing the Vestries of Fulham, Hammersmith and Chelsea, is of opinion, that the time has arrived when the Embankment should be continued from Chelsea to the Western boundary of the parish of Hammersmith, and the surveyors of the three parishes were instructed to confer together to produce a plan of the proposed Embankment showing the condition of the land whether vacant or otherwise, and also how they proposed to deal with the various classes of property concerned, giving an approximate value of the land to be acquired. After some further discussion it was resolved that the meeting do stand adjourned until that day three weeks, at 7 p.m., but on that day, the surveyors not being ready, the meeting was further adjourned and instructions given for it to be summoned so soon as the surveyors were ready. Vestry Hall and Offices. At the Vestry meeting on the 4th July, 1888, the Metropolitan member reported that he was afraid that the Metropolitan Board would not allocate the loan for the Vestry Hall over more than three months, and suggesting that a letter should be written to the Board requesting that the loan might be taken up, £5,000 at once, and £15,000, three months hence, or £10,000 at once, and £10,000 three months hence, when it was rseolved that the Clerk write to the Metropolitan Board of Works 30 in accordance with the suggestion of the Metropolitan member, which was done. At the meeting of the Committee held on the 18th of July, 1888 it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that a supplemental application be made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for a further sum to cover the professional charges of the Surveyor, Architects, and Quantity Surveyors, and the Clerk directed, on receipt of replies, to hand all the papers to the Solicitor to consider as to application being made to the Local Government Board for a loan for the large hall, which recommendation was adopted by the A estry the same evening. At an emergency meeting of the Committee held on the 1st of August, the Metropolitan member reported that the Finance Committee of that Board would lend £13,400 at 3½ per cent. towards the loan for vestry room and offices, £5,400 to be paid down, and £8,000 on the 1st November next, when it was resolved that the Metropolitan member having reported that the Finance Committee of the Metropolitan Board had agreed to recommend that Board to lend £1.3,400 at 3½ per cent, £12,600 for 30 years, and £800 for 15 years, that in the event of the loan being granted the Vestry do accept the same, and instruct the Solicitor and Clerk to complete the loan, the money when received to be placed on deposit. It was also resolved that the Overseers be requested to apply to the Local Government Board for sanction to raise a sum to build the large vestry room, and that Mr. Edwards, the surveyor, supply upon request any plans necessary for the application ; and it was further resolved that the terms of the contract be referred to this Committee, in conjunction with the Solicitor and Architect, to settle and carry out ; all of which recommendations were adopted by the Vestry the same evening. At a meeting of the Committee held on the 3rd day of August, the Metropolitan member having reported that at the meeting of that Board held that morning the loan of £13,400 was granted by the Board, and Mr. Wall, the contractor, having been interviewed he stated that he was prepared to carry out the work,but not at the prices according to his tender, as in many instances materials had gone up in price since he tendered, it was resolved that the Committee do adjourn till 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, the 9th August, and that the Clerk do, immediately on receipt of amended prices from Mr. Wall, send a copy of same to each member of the Committee. At the adjourned meeting on the 9th August, the Clerk read letter from Mr. Wall, stating that the amount to be added to his former tender, was £530, made upas follows —Bricks £246 ; Timber £186; Lead £53 ; Iron £28; and Glass £17. The Architect also made a report on the increased cost of the materials which he estimated at £271, and the matter having been fully considered it was resolved to recommend the Vestry, that having received the tender of Mr. Charles Wall, of Lots Road, Chelsea, builder, for the erection of the Vestry Hall and Offices, in accordance with the plans sealed by the Vestry, and Specification and Conditions of Contract signed by him, at the sum of £20,438 (subject to the said Mr. Charles Wall obtaining within fourteen days two persons to the satisfaction of the Clerk to the Vestry, and their entering, within twenty-one days, into a joint and several bond, to be prepared by the Solicitor, in the sum of £ ,000, for the due performance of the Contract), the said tender be accepted, and the work, upon the bond being entered into, be forthwith proceeded with. At the same meeting it was also resolved to recommend the Vestry, that in the event of the building being commenced before the next ordinary meeting of the Vestry, Mr. Woolven be placed in charge, temporarily, as Clerk of Works, to 'superintend the "work, both of which recommendations were carried by the Vestrv the same' evening. On the 19th September, 1883, the Clerk produced, at the Vestry meeting, the mortgage for securing the sum of £5,400 and interest, the first instalment of the loan of £13,400, for the Vestry Hall and Offices, when the seal of the Vestry was affixed thereto, and the loan completed on the 4th October following. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 3rd October, it was resolved that the Churchwardens and Overseers be requested to make application to the Local Government Board to issue an order for the appropriation of the balance of £425 remaining in the hands of the Fulham Board of Guardians, re Elton Villa site, and at the meeting of the Committee held on the same day, the Clerk having read letters from Mr. Wall, and the Architect, as to the continuation of building the outside walls, and from a Mr. Godwin (on behalf of lessees of property in Cedar Road), objecting to the wall, it was resolved that Mr. Wall be autherised to continue the wall A, and if necessary, to put an extra 4½ inches on the inside of the wall, abandoning the outside piers, he (Mr. Wall) not to entrench on other people's land. Mr. Wall having stated that the Clerk of Works had refused to let him (Mr. Wall) cart away sand witheut the matter having first been brought before the Committee, it was resolved that Mr. Wall be permitted to take the surplus sand, after allowing sufficient for use in the buildings. On the 17th October, 1889, the Metropolitan member reported to the Vestry that the cheque for £8,000, re Vestry Hall loan, had been drawn by the Metropolitan Board. At the meeting of the Committee held on the 18th October, it was resolved that the foundation stone be laid on Monday, 19th November, 1889, and that Mr. Thomas Goodacre, the chairman of the Committee, be invited to lay the same, and the Architect was instructed to draw up a sketch of the foundation stone, showing the position it was to occupy, and the inscription to be placed on it, and submit same to an adjourned meeting of the Committee. A cheque for £500, payable to the Architect, on account of his professional charges was passed, and referred to the Finance Committee for payment, and at the adjourned meeting held on the 23rd October, the Architect produced two designs, showing the inscription to be put on the foundation stone, and the same having been fully considered, the Committee was ordered to stand adjourned. On the 31st October, an emergency meeting of the Committee was held, the Clerk producing copy of correspondence with Messrs. Perry and Read, re party wall at No. 555, Fulham Road, and the Architect having explained the matter, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that having regard to the fact that the party wall on the west side not having been conveyed to the Vestry, that the Architect take it as an instruction from the Vestry to build the Vestry Hall within the lines of the property absolutely conveyed to the Vestry in the deed from the Churchwardens and Overseers to the Vestry, which resolution was carried at the Vestry meeting the 32 same evening, when, after considerable discussion, the Rev. F. H. Fisher, MA was unanimously invited to lay the foundation stone in lieu of Mr. T. Goodacre. On the 9th November, 1888, the Committee resolved that the foundation stone be simply inscribed, This stone was laid by Frederic Horatio Fisher, Vicar, Chairman of the Vestry of Fulham, on 19th November, 1888; that a tablet be placed inside the Vestry Hall vestibule giving the names of .the present members of the Vestry of Fulham, with their official designations, also the names of the Architect, Builder and Clerk to the Vestry: and that a Sub-Committee, consisting of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee, the Chairman of the Vestry, and Messrs. Easton and Hunt, be appointed to make the necessary arrangements re the laying the foundation stone on the 19th inst, all of which resolutions were confirmed by the Vestry the same day On the 14th November, 1888, the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Law and Parliamentary Committee, affixed their seal to the mortgages for securing the loans of £7,200, and £800 respectively, being the final instalments of the loan of £13,000 for the Vestry Hall and Offices. At the Law and Parliamentary Committee held on the 26th November, 1888, the question of ancient lights came before the Committee on a report from the Architect, and the Surveyor to the Vestry when it was resolved that the whole of the papers connected with this matter be referred to the Solicitor with instructions to see both parties and bring up a report at an adjourned meeting to be held on Wednesday, the 28th November, at 6.30 p.m. At the adjourned meeting just mentioned the Clerk read a report from the Solicitor, re the ancient lights, when the matter was ordered to stand over, and at the same meeting it was resolved to recommend the Vestry not to seal the contract re the Vestry Hall, which recommendation was, after considerable discussion, adopted by the Vestry on the 12th December following. At the meeting of the Vestry Hull Committee held on the 7th January, 1889, it was resolved,after a long and protracted discussion, to recommend the Vestry that the contract, re the Town Hall, be now sealed, and a certificate for £2,000 payable to Mr. Wall was also passed and referred to the Finance Committee for payment. At the meeting of the Law and Parliamentary Committee, held immediately after the preceding meeting of the Vestry Hall Committee, the Solicitor reported that he could get no definite amount stated by Mr. Hynain, re the ancient lights when it was resolved that the Solicitor offer £200, witheut admitting liability, in settlement of all claims fur ancient lights in respect of this property, and at an adjourned meeting of the Committee held on the 9th January, 1889, the Solicitor read copy of a letter from Messrs. Tippett, & Son to Mr. Hynam, in which they stated that the amount of compensation assessed by Mr. Hynam, at £1250, appeared to them to be a moderate sum, but that with regard to the purchase of the freehold of the four houses, their client would accept £5,500, the Vestry to pay all legal and other expenses of and incidental to the matter, as well as settle with the tenants, and he (the solicitor) having advised that copies of his letter to Mr. Hynam, and of Messrs. Tippett & Son's reply to Mr. Hynam should be sent to each member of the Committee and the consideiation of the subject adjourned to a future meeting, it was 33 resolved that the matters of ancient lights, and the sealing of the contract, re Vestry Hall, do stand over, the clerk to send copy correspondence herein to each member of this Committee, and the Solicitor to send the cheque for £2,000 to Mr. Wall, witheut prejudice, for work already done. At the adjourned meeting on the 14th January, 1889, the Committee, alter having considered the copy of correspondence, re the ancient lights, resolved (1) that the works be not delayed, but the contract be not sealed until all questions of light and air have been settled ; (2) that the Solicitor reply to the letter of the 9th instant that the Committee cannot treat with the owners and tenants of the property on the footing of that letter, that the Committee do not admit liability of any kind and have instructed the builder to proceed, but, to settle all questions of difference, the Committee are prepared to submit them to arbitration in the usual way ; and (3) the Committee hereby instruct the Solicitor to accept service of any process which may be issued on the draft submission to arbitration. At the ordinary meeting of the Law and Parliamentary Committee held on the 21st day of January, 1889, the Solicitor read letter from Messrs. Tippett & Son declining to agree to the Vestry's terms as contained in his (the solicitor's) letter, when no action was taken thereon. Footpath, Town Mead Road. At the meeting of the Law and Parliamentary Committee held on the 16th July, 1888, the Surveyor was instructed to prepare a small sketch plan showing what the Vestry required, and the Solicitor was instructed to enter into negotiations with Mr. Cole as to the diversion of the foot path. On the 1st August, 1888, the Solicitor reported to the Law and Parliamentary Committee that Mr. Cole had refused the offer which he had made to him on behalf of the Vestry. It was resolved that the Solicitor do apply for a summons against Mr. Cole for obstructing the Highway, which resolution was confirmed by the Vestry the same evening. At the meeting of the Law and Parliamentary Committee held on the 1st October, 1888, the Solicitor reported that Mr. Cole had given his ultimatum in this matter viz :—that he would give the Vestry £20 for deviating the foot-path, or restore the foot-path in its original state. It was resolved that Mr. Cole be called upon to restore the footpath in its former state, and at the meeting of the said Committee held on the 29th October, the Surveyor reported that Mr. Cole was restoring the foot-path to its original state, Old Toll House Site. On the 11th July, 1888, the Surveyor produced to the Works Committee, his report and detailed Estimate of the cost of prepaiing the site for use, viz:— Construction of River Wall. £770 do of Boundary Wall. 100 Filling in ground. £920 d 34 Resolved that the Report and Estimate be received, and the Vestry recommended to adopt and carry out same, and at the meeting of the Yestry on the 18th July, 1888, they endorsed the action of the Committee and referred the matter back to the Committee to carry out and advertise for Tenders. On the 18th September, Mr. A. C. Bean wrote asking for the temporary use of the site of the Old Toll House during the rebuilding of the wharf wall at Bowden's wharf, when the Works Committee instructed the Clerk to reply that the request could not be acceded to, as the Yestry would require the wharf themselves. At the meeting of the Work's Committee on the 26th September, the Clerk produced letters from Messrs. Woodhouse and Co., solicitors, and Messrs. Capleton, Roberts and Co., as to the fence being erected by the Yestry round the Old Toll House site, when it was resolved that the letters be officially acknowleged and referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee, the latter Committee having, on the 17th September, instructed the Surveyor to have the posts and fence erected upon the land in accordance with the Solicitor's advice. At a meeting of such Committee held on the 1st October, 1888, the Clerk read letters from Messrs. Woodhouse and Co. with reference to the fence, stating that if it was not removed within a week they should have same, or part of it, removed. The solicitor having stated that in his opinion the Yestry had a right to erect the fence in question, the Surveyor was instructed to take the necessary steps to protect the fence. On the 10th October, 1888, the Works Committee resolved that it be a recommendation to the Law and Parliamentary Committee that the fence at the Old Toll House Site be re-erected and that the material which has been sanctioned by the Vestry be deposited there for present use, which recommendation was adopted by the Law and Parliamentary Committee on the 15th October, and by the Vestry on the 17th October, 1888. The Surveyor was instructed by the Works Committee, at their meeting on October 24th, 1888, to bring up a report as to the actual cost of unloading granite by barrows and by steam crane, the cost of a crane, and any further particulars. On the 29th October, 1888, the Clerk having reported to the Law and Parliamentary Committee, that the Solicitor had been served with a writ in the Chancery Court herein at the instance of Mr. Bowden, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that the Solicitor do take the necessary steps to defend the Vestry in this action, and that the Clerk to the Vestry be instructed to request the \ estry of Hammersmith to provide all requisite evidence showing the title of this Yestry in the matter. This recommendation was endorsed by the Vestry on the 31st October, 1888. On the 7th November, 1888, the Surveyor read his report re the steam crane, &c., in which he stated that the probable cost of a 8-ton crane would be £300, and the estimated saving of cost in unloading, £107 per annum ; and the same was ordered to stand over until the Vestry's position had been decided in the matter. At the Law and Parliamentary Committee held On the 12th November, 1888, the Solicitor suggested that the Yestry slould be recommended to at once acquire the line of foreshore from the Thames Conservators, when it was resolved that the Solicitor at once enter into negotiations with the Thames Conservators for the purpose of ascertaining their price for a conveyance, acquiring the line of foreshore as set out on plan. At the Yestry meeting held on the 14th November, 1888, the chairman stated that he had received a letter from Mr. Bowden suggesting that a compromise should be arranged in this matter, and that he had forwarded same to the Vestry's Solicitor. On the 21st January, 1889, the Solicitor read letter from Messrs. Woodhouse, Trower and Co., stating that in consequence of the continued illness of Mr. Bean they were unable to give any definite reply in this matter, and he was instructed to write Messrs. Woodhouse and Co. requesting a definite answer within ten days from that date. At the meeting of the Works Committee on the 13th February, 1889, the Surveyor having read letter from the Thames Conservators, was instructed to carry out the work at the Old Toll House site in accordance with the terms arranged between the Solicitor and the Thames Conservators. On the 18th February, 1889, the Solicitor produced terms of compromise with Mr. Bowden herein, and the Surveyor having reported that he and Mr. Bean had agreed on the line, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that the terms of compromise be accepted, which recommendation was passed by the Vestry on the 20th February. At the Works Committee on the 13th March, 1889, the Surveyor was autherised to give the undertaking required by the Thames Conservators in this matter, and at the Law and Parliamentary Committee on the 20th March, 1889, the Solicitor reported that he had seen the Thames Conservators who agreed to accept £9 2s. 0d. as compensation, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that a cheque be drawn for the amount. At the same meeting the Solicitor reported that the original terms of compromise, re Bowden had been agreed by the parties, and that Messrs. Woodhouse and Co. were prepared to exchange agreements, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry to seal the agreement of compromise ; both of which recommendations were adopted by the Vestry on the Bishop's Meadow. At the Works Committee on the 7th November, 1888, the Surveyor reported that it would be desirable to get the permission of the Bishop of London to fill up the ditch with slop, and he was directed to see the Bishop of London on the matter. On the 21st November the Surveyor reported that he had arranged with the Bishop of London for a slight alteration in the outline of the ground adjoining the moat, and also to be allowed to fill up the ditch with slop, which was approved. On the 5th December, 1888, the Surveyor reported that the work was then proceeding ; and at the Works meeting on the 2nd January, 1889, he read letter from Messrs. Clutton, stating that the Bishop of London had consented to certain alterations, provided the bed adjoining the moat was properly planted so as to screen the palace grounds from the path, and an iron fence erected between the bed and the path, when he was directed to reply that the Vestry will fulfil the condition. He was also instructed to obtain an estimate of the cost of making the necessary borings at the Bishop's meadow and produce same at the next meeting. On the 13th 36 February, 1889, the Surveyor produced the plans for the laying out of the Bishop's meadow, and, having read letter from the Thames Conservators hereon, stated that he had obtained an extension of time till August 4th to carry out the work, the matter was ordered to stand over till the next meeting. At the Works Committee held on the 27th February, 1889, it was resolved that the Surveyor be instructed to bring up an estimate of the cost of the whole of the work for laying out the Bishop's meadow, and a separate estimate of the cost of the whole of the work in respect of the meadow adjoining the Bishop's Avenue. At the Works Committee on the 13th March, 1889, the Surveyor stated that the estimates of cost, &c., were not quite ready, and it was resolved that the matter stand over for one month.

Od. as against the amount shewn above. «> Property Account. During the past year the Vestry obtained a Loan of £3000 from the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the purchase of the freehold sites for stables in Munster Road, and wharf at Old Toll House Site, Putney Bridge. On the 19th September, the Vestry accepted the tender of Messrs. A. R. Flew and Co. for the erection of stables at the sum of £5158, and have paid them on account of work done £2500. 52 Vestry Hall Fund. During the year 1888-9 the interest on the £1022. 9s. 1d., 2f per cent, Annuities, mentioned in last year's Report, has been invested in the purchase of additional stock, amounting to £32 13s. 10d., increasing the total amount of stock held by the Trustees (the Vicar of Fulham and Messrs. Lammin and King) to £1,055 2s. 11d., as per the Balance Sheet. The Vestry have succeeded in obtaining a Loan of £13,400 from the Metropolitan Board of Works, towards the cost of erecting the new Vestry Hall and Offices in the Fulham Road, the foundation stone of which was laid by the Rev. F. H. Fisher, M.A., on the 10th December last, and the sum of £4,700 has been paid to the Architect and Builder on account of work done. Improvement Account. As stated in my last Report, this Account was opened with a view of providing for small items of a permanent nature, instead of carrying them to a Loan Schedule Account to be charged to future Rates. It will be seen by the Abstract of the Account, that the Receipts have been very few and the Payments very heavy during the past year, being principally brought about by the Metropolitan Board of Works, striking large items out of the first Loan Schedule presented to them. Loan Schedule. The following Schedule for a Loan of £5899 15s. 2d., for Permanent Works carried out and to be carried out, was sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 16 th October, 1888. viz :— THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM.

The money has since been received and part of it has been placed to the credit of the General Rate Account. Hammersmith Vestry. During the year 1888-9 the total sum of £632 15s. Od. has been paid to the above Vestry, being for the years' superannuations to retired officials of the late Fulham District Board of Works, for removing and disinfecting of bedding, clothing, &c., for rent of wharf, mortuary, &c., and for part maintenance of Hammersmith Road. Contributions to Local Improvements. Two sums, viz: £150 and £50, have been received during the financial year 18S8-9 from the Metropolitan Board of Works for promised contributions towards the cost of acquiring land for widening Greyhound Road (I), by Queen's Club grounds (cost of land £300); (II) by Mr. Guerrier's cottage (cost of land £100). Margravine Gardens. On the 15th March, 1889, the Metropolitan Board of Works made an order placing the maintenance, sewering, lighting, &c. cf that portion of 55 Margravine Gardens, situate in Hammersmith Parish, under the control of this Vestry, and directing Hammersmith Vestry to pay Fulham Vestry, the sum of eighty pounds per annum. At, the 25th March 1889 no payment had been made. Waterford Road Improvement. In 1887 the Vestry determined to improve the approach from the King's Road to the Broxholme Road, by rounding the corner at Watertord and Broxholme Roads. After receiving an estimate of £3,150 as the cost of this improvement from their Surveyor, they applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works for their sanction to same as a local, improvement and for a contribution towards the cost thereof. That Board instructed a committee to view the proposed widening, and on their recommendation the Vestry obtained the required sanction, and also a promise of a moiety of the cost thereof, the amount not to exceed £1575. The Vestry then instructed their Solicitor to negotiate for the purchase of the freehold and leasehold interests of the three shops and stables necessary for the improvement. These were secured in October, 1888, at a cost of £3,898 8s. l0d. The building materials were sold by auction on October 23rd, and realized a sum of £94 17s. 6d. By the beginning of December, 1888, the widening of the road, &c, had been carried out by theVestry's workmen at a total cost of £119 16s. The Vestry then advertised the surplus land, about 2,480 square feet for sale by auction, and on March the 6th, 1889, it was disposed of, at the Mart, for the sum of £830. The Metropolitan Board was then asked for their moiety of the cost, and on 16th March, 1889, sent down a representative to examine as to the net cost of the improvement, which was as follows:— £ s. d. Payments 4,202 11 7 Receipts and Credits 952 11 7 Net Cost £3,250 0 0 The Board gave their sanction to the payment of their agreed moiety of £1,575 and also agreed to lend £1,675, the balance for 30 years, the amount being received after the 25th March, 1889, from the London County Council. Local Taxation Returns. Under 23 and 24 Victoria, c. 51, and 40 and 41 Victoria, c. 66, it is enacted that every Vestry, District Board, &c. shall make a return annually of the sums levied or received by or in interest of rates, taxes, &c., and of the expenditure thereof, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. Under the above Aets the Statistical Department of the Local Government Board issue, during the month of August in each year, a form, embracing, the various heads of receipts and expenditure and of loans, &c., employed by Local Authorities. On August 3rd, 1888, forms (in duplicate) for the Local Taxation Returns, were received by this Vestrv, and referred to me to fill up. This was duly done on 17th Sept. 1888. On my presenting same to the Finance Committee, they instructed the Clerk to return the form to the Local Government Board. 56 Precepts on Corporate Bodies. The Central Boards issuing precepts on the Vestry are the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London. The Precept for the year 1888-9 of the former for the Parish of Fulham amounts to £11,953 12s. 9d., equal to the rate of 8½d. in the £. This is an increase of £1,437 10s. 1d. on that of the previous year, resulting in a rate of Id in the £ more than 1887-8. The following statement will show the amounts paid by the Fulham Parish through the late District Board, the Fulham Vestry, &c., to the Metropolitan Board over which they have no direct control.

ESTIMATES. During the past year the Vestry estimated the amount required to be raised by Rates to meet its expenses, and the call of other bodies to be as follows:— 58  1887-8 1888-9.

Notwithstanding the increase in the amount of the Precept, the Overseers were able, with the balance they had in hand, to keep the rate at the same amount in £ as in the previous year. The Local Sewers' Rate is ¼d. in the £ more than the previous year, and brought about by the increase in the Vestry's Precept, which is caused by extra sewer works and wages. The increase of ¾d in £ on the Metropolitan Board's Rate is due to the large excess on their last year's Precept. New Streets. With reference to the New Streets' Accounts, during the past year, there has been received the sum of £9,650 9s. 5d., on account of Apportionments made. The amounts still due by contributors, are, on Old Roads, transferred to this Vestry by the late District Board of Works the sum of £297 19s. 11d., and on the Streets taken to by this Vestry during the past three years the sum of £11,146 l1s. 6d., making the total due on New Streets to be £11,444 l1s. 5d. On page No. 77 will be found statements of New Streets' Account in detail. On the 4th of March, 1889, I was instructed by the Finance Committee to get out an exhaustive report, under various headings, as to the condition of New Streets' accounts at that date. At their next meeting I presented the following report:— Accountant's Department. To the Chairman and Members of the Finance Committee. Gentlemen,— Me New Streets.

We, the undersigned Auditors of the Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, for the financial year ending 25th March, 1889, hereby certify that we have examined the books of the Vestry, and have compared the vouchers with the Cheques, and we find the £ s. d. balance of 11,325 0 10 at the Bankers, on Current and Deposit Accounts to be correct, and allowing for the outstanding cheques amounting to 504 10 5 The Balance to be £10,820 10 5 We have also examined the Loan Account of the Vestry, and we find that the Loans, including £25,300 £ s. d. borrowed during the past year, amount to 55,068 0 0 We wish to call attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the New Streets Accounts, a sum of £3,158 19s. l1d., being yet unrecovered, and consider that the Vestry should devise some means for preventing this accumulation of arrears. We also find that the sums of £50 and £20 disbursed by* the Vestry on the subject of Lammas Rights is an illegal payment, but believe the expenditure was made with the approval of the Ratepayers, and, therefore, have not surcharged the amount. We are of opinion that the Vestry did not sufficiently investigate the title to the property in Munster Road, utilized for stables, whereby the sum of £125 and costs have been incurred unnecessarily. We suggest that the audit should take place earlier than two or three days before the Election. We wish to place on record that we find the books have been kept in a clear and very satisfactory manner, and that great credit is due to the Accountant. Dated this 21st day of May, 1889. (Signed) A.

These have received continuously my careful attention. The pressure exerted to reduce the expenditure upon them under the item of granite has the effect of causing them to deteriorate in condition. The following statement will show where granite has been used, and the amount. STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURE OF GRANITE.

In all probability the expense of maintaining a number of them will, in the future, be partially or entirely borne by the London County Council, under the provisions relating to main roads contained in the Local Government Act. 1888 (See heading, "Main Roads).

The contract price for this year (1889) has risen from 10s.8d. a yard, in 1888, to 13s.5d., an increase of 2s.9d. a yard. I venture to suggest that if the Vestry would arrange in the contract to give one 102 order in the summer months, when freights are low, for the whole of the Granite estimated to be required during the year, the contractors might make a considerable reduction in price.

TAR PAYING. Buckle's Alley and Goater's Alley have been tar-paved during the year. Area 1056 square yards. WOOD PAYING, WALHAM GREEN. The wood paving in Walham Green, area 12,469 sq. yards, is beginning to show signs of wear in places. This was laid in May and June, 1885. WOOD PAVING, KING'S ROAD. This work was completed in May, 1888, in a very satisfactory manner, many improvements in the levels and gradients of the road having been effected. The total area completed was 5052 sup. yards— cost, £1969 6s. 8d. The amount spent on the necessary repairs and alterations of the paving of the side walks amounted to £278 12s. 7d. WOOD PAYING, NORTH END ROAD. This work was commenced in October, 1888, and finished in January, 1889. It had to be done in sections on account of the difficulty of arranging for the traffic. The area was 8385 sup. yards, and the cost for the roadway £3231 10s. 5d. The sum of £224 0s. 2d. was also spent in repairing the footways. WOOD PAYING, LILLIE ROAD. Was commenced in February, 1889, The area is 4885 sq. yards, and the amount of tender £2000. All this work has been carried out with deal blocks on six inches of Portland cement concrete. In this Road a strip 6ft.6in. wide of Jarrah Wood Pavement has been laid. \ v 103 FULHAM ROAD. The next road in order for wood paving is the Fulham Road from the " George to Putney Bridge. The area of the road is about 16,000 square yards and the cost for deal blocks will probably be about £7,700. I have estimated the present cost of cleansing and maintenance, &o to be £1416 0s. Od. per annum, and the cost of cleansing and maintenance when paved with wood will be £1870 per annum. This is a main road and the Vestry ought to be able to make some arrangement with the London County Council in reference to the cost of wood paving. SIDE WALKS. During the year these have received proper attention, repairs being constantly effected. 3116 sq. feet) of York Paving, costing £97 7s. 6d. have been obtained and used during the twelve months. PORTLAND CEMENT. Great inconvenience is experienced during the progress of large contracts on account of the Vestry not possessing a cement testing machine of the ordinary kind in use. The small machine at present belonging to the Vestry is objected to by all the manufacturers and contractors who seem to place no reliance on the tests made by it. In consequence whenever a dispute has arisen, I have been obliged to attend at Vauxhall where a machine has been kindly placed at my disposal. The fact that in two of the largest contracts entered into by the Vestry many tons of the cement supplied have been rejected, shews how necessary it is for the Vestry to possess complete testing apparatus.

For unstopping drains &c., six different sums amounting to £21 12s. 7d. have been handed to the Accountant. I again beg to call the attention of the Vestry to the necessity for appointing sufficient and special Inspectors to superintend the laying the drainage of private property. The matter ought either to be placed in the hands of an officer who should have no other duties and so be responsible, or additional Sanitary Inspectors might be appointed, each undertaking the supervision of the drainage in his District. To properly supervise the work every pipe should be laid under the eye of an Inspector. I also call attention to the increased number of buildings in this District as shewn by the above table. STEEET CLEANSING. The sweepers employed on the roads numbered 44 in March, 1889. The A estry now own two sanding machines, four street sweepers, four dust carts (purchased in March, 1889 at a cost of £90 14s. Od.) and 2 four-wheel water vans (purchased in June, 1888, at a costof£74.) 'l'wo road scrapers have also been ordered at an estimated cost of £2S. 115 DUST.

Some of them appeared in my last Annual Report, but the importance of the subject justifies the repetition. To the DESTRUCTOR SUB-COMMITTEE rc DUST. whabfage accommodation. « On the 17th September, 1886, I pointed out to the joint Works ” "and Cartage Committees that it would be necessary to obtain " sufficient wharfage accommodation to provide for the unloading ot ” " granite and materials for the roads, a disinfecting station, a space ” ,, for the dealing with the dust and for a destructor, also for the” " disposal of the slop and ashes, &c., by barges. 116 " I also pointed out that there should be space for at leapt thiee' barges alongside at a time, or a. river frontage of over 200 feet, and ” " submitted plans of six suitable sites. Again, on the 18th July, 1888, " I stated that a destructor must be situated at the river side in order " '' to facilitate the disposal of the clinkers. I may also point out to the " members of the Vestry that water-carriage is always the cheapest. " Comparative cost per annum of various schemes for the disposal of " " dust. The costs of collection, &c., will be the same in all cases. "L Barging at Mr. Covington's last price— £ s. d. " 12,000 loads at 2s. 3d. a load 1350 0 0 ” 2.

Gd. 900 0 0 " The method of dealing with the dust adopted by Mr. Lucas seems to " " me to be sanitary and preventive of waste, and is but a development of " processes existing at Paddington and eluewhere. " " My impression is that the most economical and final method of " " dealing with the dust in London will be a combination of a sorting " '' machine for the valuable products, similar to Paddington, and a " " destructor for the useless and unsanitary products. The process will " " have to be carried out at the river side in order to allow the different " " products to be separately barged away. " In conclusion I beg to remind the members of this Committee that " " many such things, as ashes, breeze, old iron, glass, rags, cork, &c., found " " in dust have a marketable value, that the wholesale destruction of these " " things, either by tipping or by burning in a destructor, amounts to waste. " " I, therefore, should strongly favour a scheme that made use of these " " products. With reference to the subject of tipping the dust in shoots, " " this method is cheaper per load than perhaps any other scheme. It " further saves a considerable amount of cartage, and I mvself cannot " " see any sanitary objection to tipping, provided that the sshes are " covered over with clean soil, and the site is permanontl retained as an " " open space or garden. " Since writing the reports, portions of which are set forth above, I have thought of a scheme that would, in my opinion,leave a profit to the \estiy, besides saving the present considerable annual outlay for shoots, &c., viz : to buy several acres of land near the river, available for wharves. The sand and ballast can be excavated and sold, leaving about twenty feet in depth to be filled in with dust and slop. One acre, which ought to be bought for £1.500, will, after the removal of the sand, &c., tack one year' s dust and slop to till up to the level required by the lhames Conservators, the increase in the value of the land ough to pay the interest on the original cost of the land, during the time it is held by the Vestry. 117 The profit will be as follows:— The value of the Sand and Ballast, say only 12,000 cube yards at Is. 6d. to allow for removal of other soil (The Vestry pays 3s. for Sand and 2s. for Ballast 900 0 0 The saving of the present expenditure, viz: — 12,000 loads of Dust at Is. 6d. 900 0 0 16,000 loads of Slop at 6d. 400 0 0 Total £2,200 0 0 There may be some legal difficulties to be overcome in adopting this method, cut it is one that appears to strongly commend itself. dust collecting and wages of men. In Dccembei, l888, I made a Report, of which the following are extracts:— Jones report states that " the men lose time owing to the collection " " of the " tots,'' and tho carts waiting- for one another, also that no more " loads are carried per day at the present time than when the shoots were " " at a greater distance from the centre of the parish." " The Committee probably do not know that the collection of the " tots " "invariably causes an extra journey at the end of the day for one horse " " from each gang to the Place where the " tots " are dispsed of " The following table gives particulars in reference to other parishes: — parish.

Size of cart Oft. 3in. by 3ft. l0in. by 3ft, One important matter iu tho Table, to which I beg to call the especial attention of the Committee is that the price paid to the Contractor at Chelsea is only 2s. 6d. per load of three yards, the Contractor finding men and horses, whereas our carts only hold 2/. yards. The cost of one of our loads is Is. 6d. for wages, and horse hire (at 8s. 6d. per horse per day less man's wages, 4s.), at four loads a da}", Is. 1½ or a total of 2s.7½d per load. On the 29th June, 1886, I presented a report in which I shewed that from March, 1886, to that date, 2901 loads were carted by 718 horses one day each, or an average of over four loads per horse per day. the dust was then tipped on the Bishop's Meadow, now that the shoot is more cential four loads a day ought to be the minimum number. Under the present system the men are divided in five gangs, each consisting of two horses and three men, with an extra gang occasiona y. These gangs work entirely separate districts, and, in my opinion, are too much out of the sight of the Inspector to bo properly under his control. The points submitted to the decision of the commiitee, weie 1. Shall "Totting " be abolished? 2. Shall the men be paid per load or weekly . 118 3. The wages of the men ? 4. Shall a minimum number of loads per day be required, with extra pay for an increased number of loads? 5. Shall the present system be continued, or all the gangs work one district at a time so as to be under the supervision of the Dust Inspector ? The final results of the deliberations of the Committee were that the Vestry passed the following resolutions on the 13th of February, 1889 :— 1.- That iu the absence of any of the Dustmen or Drivers, the Superin" tendent of Roads be instructed to fill up any vacancies in the gangs " then working. 2 . '' That totting" be entirely abolished; any men found disobeying to " be discharged, and that Messrs. Rose and Co. and Mr. Bagley be " asked to take Id. per load off their Contract price. 3—''That each horse be required to remove not less than 24 loads per week " and that the wages of the gang be as follows :— Is. 6d. per load for " the 24 loads, and Is. 8d. per load for any loads over and above the 24 loads per horse per week. 4.—" That the old system of working the Parish be adopted, viz: all the " gangs working in one district, and that the Dust Inspector be instructed to ascertain on the previous afternoon where the men can " start in the morning.

STEAM ROLLER. New driving wheels have been procured for the same at a cost of £33 1s. 6d. 129 STABLES On the 2nd of May, 1888, the Vestry finally adopted plans for stables for 44 horses with loft over centre portion, dwelling house, 4 loose boxes, and for the conversion of some of the arches into store rooms mess room, wheelwrights shop, blacksmiths shops, &c. On the 19th of September, the tender of Messrs A. R. Flew and Co amounting to £5,158 was accepted for the work. The foundation stone was laid on the 1st of January, 1889, by Mr. C. A. Walter, Chairman of the Cartage Committee. During the progress of the work the owners of Laurel Bank commenced proceedings against the Vestry, with a view to compel their adhesion to some old covenant which would have prevented the erection of the stables where intended, and the Vestry was obliged to settle the matter by the payment of £125 and £14 14s. Od. costs. MORTUARY. The Vestry having finally decided to build a one-story building for a Mortuary and Coroner's Court, I prepared plans accordingly and on the 17th October, 1888, the tender of Mr. R. Cox, amounting to £1193, was accepted subject to some further deductions being made which reduced the amount of the tender to £975. Some slight further delay took place before the land came into the possession of the Vestry, but the work is now progressing. WHARF. old toll house site. In June, 1888, the Thames Conservators sanctioned an extension of the site about 40.0 further into the river and increasing the area nearly 600 sq. yards. For this the Vestry had to pay the Conservators a fee or fine of £9 2s. Od. A fence having been erected around the site of the wharf by the Vestry, was pulled down by the instructions of Mr. Bowden,the owner of the adjoining wharf. From this an action arose which gave a vast deal of trouble and led to the making of numbers of plans and affidavits. The action was however finally compromised by the Vestry conceding a better approach to Mr. Bowden, each party paying their own costs. Plans for a river wall, &c., to the wharf are now in progress. WATERFORD ROAD IMPROVEMENT. This improvement, by which the corner of the Waterford and Broxholme Road has been set back, enabling the corner to be rounded and throwing 120 square yards into the road and footways, has been completed. My estimate of the net cost was £3,150, the actual cost has been £4,202 lis. 7d. Rents received amount to £59 5s. 8d. net. The surplus land sold for £795 14s. 8d., the old materials for net £77 2s. 1d. timber for shoring £20 9s. 2d., leaving the net cost £3250. BISHOP'S MEADOW. This matter, for which I first made plans in May, 1887, has not progressed much. The line of frontage has been settled with the Thames Conservators and my plans approved by them, also by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. 130 In March, a considerable enlargement of the original scheme was necessitated by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners offering, and the Vestry accepting an additional piece of land, about 5½ acres in extent, for a lease of 999 years, at an annual rental of £1. This land adjoins the Bishop's meadow, and extends along the side of the Bishop's Avenue from the river to the Fulham Palace Road. Plans embracing a scheme for converting the whole of the land (about 12 acres) into a park and recreation ground (estimated cost £10,000) were at once prepared and they are now with the London County Council, to whom an application for a contribution to the cost of carrying out the work has been made. MAIN ROADS. local government act, 1888. The following report prepared on the subject was published in March last. The roads which I suggest should be taken over by the County Council are contained in a list at the end of the report. Surveyor's Department, Vestry Halt., Walham Green. March 13th, 1889. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of Fulham. REPORT RE MAIN ROADS Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, This matter is one of exceedingly great importance to the Vestries of the Metropolis, and I have therefore prepared for the Works Committee, a report on the subject, that, I hope may be of assistance to them in determining the course to be pursued. It will be first desirable to give the definition of a Main road, and the chief points of Section 11 in the Local Government Act, 1888, which deal with this subject. Those desirous of going more fully into details are referred to the Section of the Act. Definitions of a Main Road. Sec,13, Highwavs Act, 1878. A road that has ceased to be a turnpike road since the 31st December, 1870. Sec.15, Highways Act, 1878. A road being a medium of communication between great towns, or a thoroughfare to a railway station, or otherwise, which, after application by the Vestry, the District Council shall be satisfied ought to be a main road, and shall order accordingly. Section 11 of the Local Government Act, 1888, is divided into Sub-Sections, as follows:— Sub-Section 1—States that every main road, inclusive of ridges, shall be wholly maintained and repaired by the County Council after the 1st April, 1889, and all the usual powers relating to roads will be vested in the Council for the purpose of "repair, maintenance, improvement, enlargement of, and other "dealing with" such road. 131 Sub-Section 2.—Provides that if the Vestry "claim to retain" the maintenance, etc., of a main road; or of any road that may hereafter become a main road, the Vestry "shall be entitled" to do so; and the County Council shall contribute "towards the costs of the maintenance," etc. Sub-Section 4.—Provides that the County Council "may contract "with" the local authority for the maintenance, etc., of the main roads, and that the local authority "shall undertake the same" for a payment to be agreed upon. Sub-Section 5.—Provides that no payment shall be made by the County Council for maintenance, etc., of a road, unless it is maintained etc., to the satisfaction of the County Council or of their Surveyor, Sub-Section 6.—Provides for the ownership and right of access to the sewers in main roads. Sub-Section 7.—Provides that the declaration of a road to be a main road shall not take effect until the road is placed in proper repair to the satisfaction of the Council. Sub-Section 8.—Gives power to the Council to compel the local authority to repair, etc., main roads which are paid for by the Council. Sub-Sections 3, part of 4, and 9.—Provide for the settlement of differences as to the amount to be paid for maintenance arising under Sub-Sections 2, 4 and 8, by either party referring to the arbitration of the Local Government Board. Sub-Section 10.—Is a very important clause, and authorises the County Council, "if they think lit, to contribute towards the costs of the maintenance, repair, enlargement, and improvement of any highway or public footpath in the County although the same is not a main road.'' Sub-Section 11.—Provides for the lighting of main roads by the existing local authority. Sub-Section 12.—Provides for power to break up roads for sewerage and other purposes, etc., by existing authorities, and for making good same to the satisfaction of the County Council. It will be seen by reference to the definitions that as there are no dis-turnpiked Roads in this Parish, the number of Main Roads will depend on the view taken by the Council of the Roads which the Vestry may ask the Council to declare Main Roads. The first step should therefore be, to ask the Council to declare the thoroughfares submitted to them for their consideration to be Main Roads, of course supporting such application with particulars and reasons for it. From Sub-Section 1, it would appear that if the Council take the Main Roads, the whole cost will come out of the County Fund; but, from Sub-Section 2, if the Vestry claim to maintain them, the Council will only contribute " towards" the cost of maintenance. By Sub-Section 4, the Council may contract with the Vestry for the maintenance of Main Roads; and it would seem the general intention of 132 the Act, that the cost of main roads should be borne by the County Fund, but that the Local Authorities should do the work under the control, and to the satisfaction of, the Central Authority. It is obvious that the Fulham Road can be better superintended and more cheaply maintained by the Vestry, which has the materials, etc., close at hand, than by a Central Authority. This remark applies equally to the maintenance, etc., of the roadways over Bridges (such as Putney Bridge), which, up to the present, have remained under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The word "towards," in Sub-Section 2, seems to imply that the Vestry might receive a less amount than the full cost of maintenance by "claiming to maintain " main roads. As, however, before.any payment is made, the Council have to be satisfied with the condition of the road, the maintenance which is the common object of all, would be attained, and it would not be equitable to make the Vestry losers, for claiming to maintain the roads, while the Council succeeded in having the work done in the most economical manner, and in the method least troublesome to themselves. An offer to the Vestry of less: than the full cost of maintenance would probably lead to a reference to the arbitrament of the Local Government Board, who might take what I suggest is the equitable view of the subject. This question is also one that should at once be submitted to the Council, as their decision might influence the action of the Vestry. The words "reasonable improvement,"&c., in Sub-Section 2, clearly will enable the County Council to subscribe the cost of paving the Fulham Road with wood, a work which this Vestry is so anxious to have carried out; and on the application to the Council to declare it a main road, the Council might be informed of the wish of the Vestry in this matter. The next question is that of determining the amount of the contributions. The most reliable and easiest method will be the keeping of separate accounts, showing the amount of labour and material used on the roads, and for the Council to make periodical payments to the Vestry based on these accounts. A question has been raised as to whether the terms "maintenance," etc., will cover the cost of cleansing, watering and other items. Under Sub-Section 1, a road will wholly belong to the Council, and the cost of all this work must therefore fall on the County Fund; identical terms are used, viz.:—maintenance, repair, improvement and enlargement of and other dealing with such Road,' in all the other Sub-Sections, (except No. 10 referred to later on): it therefore seems reasonable to suppose that the work of cleansing, etc., is intended to be included by the wording of the Sub-Sections, especially as all Surveyors will maintain that such work is essential to, and a necessary part of the maintenance. The attention of the Vestry is particularly called to Sub-Section 10, which provides at the discretion of the Council for contributions for maintenance and improvement of any highway or public footpath. This 133 is the only clause which specifies a footpath and as an example of the powers it gives, it would have enabled the Council at their own expense to carry out the suggested widening of Wheatsheaf Alley. The general effect of these Regulations will be to necessitate the maintenance of the roads in better order than heretofore, and the Vestry must take care that reasonable sums are allowed in the estimates for the year for the necessary materials, and that they are provided. The amount after this year will probably be greatly reduced, as the Vestry will be able to claim a considerable amount from the County Council for the maintenance of the main roads. It would not be right to conclude this report without stating that at a conference of delegates from the various Vestries and District Boards held on the 14th February, 1880, the following resolution was carried, viz., —That in the opinion of this Conference the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis should make application to the County Council for orders declaring those highways in their respective districts which are means of communication between different districts, or thoroughfares to railway stations, or which are used largely by metropolitan traffic, as opposed to local traffic, to be main roads under the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878, and the Local Government (England and Wales) Act, 1888, and the Conference is further of opinion that the County Council should make such orders accordingly. On the following page will be found the roads which, in my opinion, the Vestry are entitled to claim to be declared main roads, under Section 15 of the Highways and Locomotives Amendment Act, 1878:- 134 SCHEDULE.

NORRINGTON, Surveyor to the Vestry of Fulham. 135 RE ELECTRIC LIGHTING The West Middlesex Electric Lighting Co. limited have endeavoured to obtain a renewal of the powers winch were granted to them in 1884. to light this district. At that time the company failed to carry out any of the works within the limit of two years as required by the terms of the order. The Vestry decided to oppose the renewal of the powers sought by the company, for the following reasons amongst others. The company sought to renew the powers obtained by the previous order under very much the same terms, whereas since the date of the order, (1884) vast improvements have been made in the methods of lighting by electricity. As an enquiry into the whole question of Electric Lighting was being made by the Board of Trade, it was thought, advisable to await the result of their deliberations. CHURCH STREET IMPROVEMENTS. This work is being carried out by the London County Council. PLAN OF THE DISTRICT. I have again to call attention to my remarks in my former reports on this matter. The longer it is left the greater will be the trouble and the cost of preparing it. As i have pointed out before, the Hammersmith Vestry retain by order of the Secretary of State the plans of many of the sewers of this district. CROMWELL ROAD BRIDGE. This improvement for a time fell through, owing to the London County Council, on succeeding the Metropolitan Board, having decided to abandon the Act of Parliament intended to deal with this and other schemes. It is, however, now under the consideration of the engineer of the London County Council, who recommends a 60ft.-wide bridge, instead of the width of 40ft. which had heen arranged for, and for which all the laud on the Fulham side had been promised. The suggestion to increase the width shows how important and necessary the bridge must be considered. It will, however, necessitate the whole of the work being commenced de novo, and add largely to the cost. I give below the width of all the bridges leading into the parish and venture to suggest that some of these might be improved and widened at a comparatively small cost, and with even greater advantage to this district than the extra 20 feet width will be to the Cromwell Road Bridge, especially as I much fear that this extra width may have the effect of entirely preventing the completion of the scheme. When dealing with the Metropolitan Board the Vestry in May, 1888, published 150 copies of a report and explanatory plans and circulated them amongst the members of the Board, Whatever action the Vestry may now take, it will be advisable for them to adopt a similar method of bringing their views before the members of the London County Council. The least widths of the Bridges leading to this District between the abutments are:— ft. in. ft. in. Stanley Bridge - 33 0 Gliddon Road Bridge - 40 3 Stamford Bridge - 37 6 Fulham and Putney Bridge 44 1 Lillie Bridge - - 35 3 Wandsworth Bridge - 29 10 136 PAVING IN FRONT OF CHURCHES. On the 2nd May, 1888, it was resolved to pave at the expense of the Vestry around the churches of the Holy Cross, in Ashington, Bettridge, and Cortayne roads. NAME PLATES. A number of name plates have been fixed wherever required during the year. On the 11th July, 1888, the tender of the Sand Blast Company was accepted at 6d. per plate for small glass name plates to fix in the street lamps. Since that date a great number of these name plates have been fixed. MARGRAVINE GARDENS. This road, which is situated partly in Fulham and partly in Hammersmith, has been taken to and made up during the year, and the Metropolitan Board asked to vest it in one of the Parishes. The award of the Board was received on the 15th March, 1889, and was to the effect that Fulham should cleanse and maintain the road, and the Hammersmith Yestry pay an annual contribution of £80 to Fulham parish to cover the cost. LAMMAS RIGHTS AND TOWN MEADOWS. A great number of meetings have been held on this subject during the year, and generally speaking the objects the Yestry have in view have been considerably advanced. I have also prepared a plan (now published) to accompany the report prepared by Mr. Percival Birkett, who has advised the Yestry in the matter. PUBLIC FOOTPATHS. These have continued to receive my especial attention during the year. Whenever they have appeared to me to be encroached on, especial care has been taken to have them defined with boundary stones. A portion of the path 593 feet long, (area 395 square yards) running out of the Greyhound Road, and lying between Tasso Road and Garvan Road was stopped up in April, 1888, by the owner of the adjoining land, the Yestry receiving for their consent and assistance £150, and 77 sq. yards of land to widen Greyhound Road. Also a portion of Church Path, length 165 feet (area 110 sq. yards) leading from Mendora Road to Delaford Street was stopped in April, 1888. The Yestry in this case receiving £100 and 144 sq. yards of land thrown into Rylston Road. Re LINES OF FRONTAGE. Applications to the Metropolitan Board re Lines of Frontage were made in the following cases. Eustace Road (Mr. Dell). Fulham Road, adjoining Walham Green Station (Messrs. Temple and Graham). Lodge Avenue (Mr. C, Butcher). Greyhound Road, opposite Queen's Club (Mr. W. H. Gibbs). Shorrolds road (Mr. Hemingway). 137 Action was taken by the Vestry against Messrs. Cooper and Sparksman in reference to the line of frontage adopted by them in Dawes Road. A decision, however, was given against the Vestry by the magistrate, and the Metropolitan Board afterwards expressed an opinion that the Vestry ought to have appealed against the decision. APPOINTMENTS. Mr. Wm. Sykes was appointed an additional Clerk of Works on the 23rd of May, 1888, and Mr. T. P. Munford received a similar appointment on the 14th November, 1888. GENERAL. During the year 233 meetings of the Vestry and the various Committees have been held, of these I have attended about 180, the greater part of them having been held in the evening, after the usual working hours. The number of letters despatched from the office amount to 1628, against 1500 last year. As an illustration of the almost constant pressure on the Department owing to the amount of work demanded from it, I beg to state that all the officials in it have frequently had to remain late and in the case of Mr. Cleghorn, he has made 450 hours overtime. Such pressure ought to be relieved by the employment of additional assistance. The succession of the London County Council to the Metropolitan Board of Works, which took place on the 21st March, 1889, also appears likely to add to the duties of the Department. The Vestry make a charge on the Contributors of 5 per cent on the cost of making up new streets or laying sewers to cover office expenses. Of this amount 3 per cent. has been earned when the cost has been apportioned, so that during the last three years this department has earned the following amounts. £ s. d. 5 per cent on Streets completed - - - 1065 12 9 3 per cent on 23 Streets apportioned only - 349 2 8 3 percent on 3 Sewers „ „ 48 7 0 5 per cent on private drainage work - - 97 16 8 Total £1560 19 1 CERTIFICATES TO CONTRACTORS. One hundred and eleven certificates extending over 47 contracts for payment for work to New Streets, Sewers, Wood Paving, Stables, &c., have been given during the year for sums amounting to a total of £22,177 8s. 3d. 138 INVENTORY OF PLANT, MACHINERY, AND LIVE STOCK TAKEN APRIL, 1889. Live Stock—21 horses, 1 pony. Machinery—1 10-ton steam road roller and tools, purchased about eleven years ago, at a cost of £400; 4 horse sweeping machines; 2 sanding machines, 2 road scrapers and 1 chaff cutter.

CONCLUSION. In eoncluding this report, I have again the pleasure of expressing my entire satisfaction with various Officials in my department, viz., Mr William P. Jones, the Superintendent of Roads; Mr. F. W. J. Palmer, the Assistant Surveyor; Mr. Charles Bottenll, Chief Outdoor Assistant, Mr. William Sykes and Mr. J. Munford, Clerks of Works, and Mr. A. W. Cleghorn, Junior Assistant, and I desire to thank them for their able assistance. I also beg to repeat my thanks to the other Officials, and many of the Members of the Vestry, for their co-operation, assistance, and courtesy during the year. I remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, Surveyor to the Vestry. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM. SANITARY DEPARTMENT. THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Being for the Year 1888-9. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM. SANITARY DEPARTMENT Vestry Offices, Walham Green, S.W. September, 1889. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Third Annual Report for the Parish of Fulham. The vital statistics are for the registration year ended 31st December, 1588, and the sanitary statistics for the parochial year ended March 25th, 1889. The estimated population for the year, calculated on the increased number of inhabited houses, amounts to 86,000. The sanitary statistics, which deal with the parochial year, are, as usual, considered in two separate districts, the Northern and the Southern. The area of the Parish in statute acres is 1,716, giving a rate of 5011 inhabitants per acre. The average for the Metropolis being 57.3 inhabitants per acre. During the year 2,983 Births were registered in the Parish, viz:— Males, 1577, and Females, 1406, as against 2870 in last year, being at the annual rate of 3468 per 1000 inhabitants. The annual birth rate throughout the Metropolis was 30.7. The births registered during the first quarter of the year were the highest, viz:—787, and during the third quarter the lowest, viz:—708. There were 1577 deaths registered during the year, viz:—Males 763 and Females 814, as against 1545 in the previous year. Of these, 202 were non-parishioners. 120 deaths of Parishioners occurred in public institutions out of the Parish. Deducting the deaths of non-parishioners and adding those of Parishioners dying out of the Parish, the deaths were equivalent to a rate of 17.38 per 1000 inhabitants. The death rate throughout the Metropolis was 18.5 per 1000. Of the deaths, 487 were of children under one year, and 298 were of persons of 60 years and upwards. 142 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Three hundred and thirty-nine deaths were attributable to diseases of the zymotic class, being equivalent to 215 per cent. of the total number of deaths, as against 23 3 per cent. last year. The following particulars show that while there has been a large decrease in the number of.deaths from scarlet fever and diarrhoea as, compared with last year, there has been a large increase in the deaths from whooping cough. Disease. Number of Deaths, 1887. Number of Deaths, 1888. Small Pox 0 1 Measles 88 76 Scarlet Fever 106 79 Diphtheria 17 18 Whooping Cough 30 67 Typhus Fever 0 1 Typhoid Fever 20 18 Simple continued Fever 0 1 Diarrhoea 97 78 Cholera 2 0 Total 360 339 Eighty-four inquests were held during the year, 40 were certified as from violence. I append a list of Inquests marked C. Three hundred and forty-nine deaths occurred in public institutions and six were registered as uncertified. Of the deaths in public institutions, 239 occurred in the Fulham Union, 125 in the Western Hospital and 5 in the St. Joseph's Orphanage. The birth rate throughout the Metropolis was equal to 307 per 1000, and the death rate 18.5 per 1000. In the three preceding years the death rate was 19.8, 19.9 and 19.6 respectively. TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR. The mean temperature of the air throughout the year was:First quarter 36.9° Second quarter 516° Third quarter 576° Fourth quarter 44-6° WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the parish is drawn from the Chelsea Water Works Company; and according to the report of Professor Frankland, the Public Analyst of the water supply of the metropolis, it has maintained the high quality which it has now exhibited for several years past. 143 WORK DONE BY SANITARY INSPECTORS. The accompanying table, marked A, shows the work done by the Sanitary Inspectors in their respective districts, and the distribution of infectious diseases in each district. SUMMONSES. I append a list, marked B, showing all the summonses taken out during the year, with the results. In conclusion, I would again call the attention of the Yestry to the efficient way in which the Inspectors have carried out their various duties during the past year, especially Mr Croucher, who I consider deserves an increase of salary. Finally, I would thank the Yestry for the consideration and courtesy shown me on all occasions. I have the honor to be, Your obedient servant, To the Chairman and FRANCIS EGAN, L.K.Q.C.P.I., Members of the Yestry of the Medical Officer of Health.
