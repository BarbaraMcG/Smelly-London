The Past Year. This Report embraces the period from the 26th day of March, 1898, to the 25th day of March, 1899, and contains a summary of the more important proceedings of the Board. During this period 93 Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 18 Special 3 Total 21 Committee Meetings— Finance 22 Law and Parliamentary 10 Sanitary 12 Works 22 Special 6 Total 72 Making in all a total of 93 Changes in the Personnel of the Board. At the election of members in June, 1898, Messrs. Stanley J. Bussell, Boyd Burnett Joll, and Edmund Surrey were elected in the place of Arthur R. Carter, John Milner, and Philip Valentine. At the first meeting in June, George Philip Willoughby, Esq., J.P., was for the fifth time re-elected Chairman of the Board. 9 Accounts. The accounts for the past year have been prepared in the usual form, and after being examined by the Board's Chartered Accountant, have been investigated by the elected Auditors, whose certificate of the result of their examination will be found appended at the foot of the accounts on page 51. The comparative statement of Income and Expenditure of the past year with that of the previous year is as follows:— COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE For the years ending 25th March, 1898, and 25th March, 1899.

The proceedings of the Commissioners, who are elected under the Public Libraries Act, 1892, are published separately. 11 In the month of June, 1898, an election took place to fill the vacancies caused by the retirement of Messrs. J. Forbes-Robertson, G.W. Haines and E.J. Gardiner. Mr. G.W. Haines did not seek re-election. Messrs. E.J. Gardiner, J. Forbes-Robertson and Horatio Porter were appointed to fill the vacancies. In the month of February, 1899, the Board received from the Commissioners the copy of a resolution suggesting that application should be made to the Local Government Board for an order transferring the powers and duties of the Commissioners to the Board. In taking this matter into consideration the Board came to the conclusion that the transfer was desirable, and a resolution to that effect was accordingly passed and communicated to the Local Government Board, but up to the time of presenting this report no communication has been received in reply, and it seems that this is in consequence of the impending changes in the local government of London. Improvements. Short's Gardens, Widening. A small improvement, but one of considerable advantage to the traffic in the immediate neighbourhood, has been arranged by the setting back of the new premises of the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation on the south side of Short's Gardens at its entrance from Drury Lane. Messrs. Watney, Combe & Co., Limited, have made a contribution towards the cost. Portsmouth Street. The improvement in Portsmouth Street referred to in the last annual report has been completed during the year and the land thrown into the public way. 12 Suggested Widening of High Holborn between Southampton Row and Southampton Street. It is much to be regretted that advantage was not taken by the London County Council of the demolition of property on the north side of High Holborn, between Southampton Row and Southampton Street, with a view to the same being widened. It is difficult to understand what influences were brought to bear upon the Improvements Committee of the London County Council, who after having in the first instance recommended that the same should be carried out, at a subsequent meeting withdrew their recommendation.

The necessity for the formation of a new north to south thoroughfare has been so apparent for such a long period of time that it is difficult to understand how it has never been carried out. Since the constitution of the London County Council there have been several schemes for the formation of a new street from High Holborn to the Strand, but it was not until the month of July, 1893, that anything approaching unanimity as to the line which the new thoroughfare should take was arrived at. In the month of June, 1898, the London County Council adopted a report of their Improvements Committee, recommending that application should be made to Parliament for power to construct a new street from High Holborn to the Strand and to sanction the widening of Southampton Row. This street is to be formed by the widening of Little Queen Street on its eastern and western sides, and by the formation of a new street from Great Queen Street to the Strand near the northern corner of the Olympic Theatre, from which point two curved streets are to be formed connecting the new thoroughfare with the Strand, which is to be widened at a point where Wych Street and Holywell Street open on to the roadway west of St. Clement Danes Church and between Catherine Street and Wellington Street In addition it also includes six subsidiary or junction streets, viz: (1) between the new street and Little Wild Street; (2) between the new street and Lincoln's Inn Fields; (3) between the new street and the existing point of junction of Great Wild Street and Kemble Street; (4) 14 between the new street and Clare Street and Clare Market; (5) between the curved street and Houghton Street, Strand, and (6) a new street between Wellington Street and Catherine Street. There is in connection with this, a proposal for the widening of Southampton Row on the east side between Theobald's Road and High Holborn, and a widening of High Holborn on the north side between Southampton Row and a point 50 yards east from the centre of Southampton Row; a new street, commencing in Kingsgate Street, at the west of Fisher Street, and a new street, commencing in Kingsgate Street, at the west of Eagle Street, into the widening of Southampton Row. The importance of this work cannot be over-estimated. The Bill, when introduced into the House of Commons, was referred by the Board to the Law and Parliamentary Committee for consideration and report. A report was presented by the Clerk to the Board on the matter, and the Committee came to the conclusion, and the Board adopted their recommendation, that steps should be taken for protecting the interests of the district in certain matters of detail, viz.:—with regard to the payment of rates during the course of construction, the materials with which the new street should be paved, and the question as to out of what fund the cost of the maintenance of the same should be defrayed, and the application of the betterment charge. The Bill was referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, who will, it is expected, very shortly deal with the matter. 15 London Government Bill. Legislation on the subject of local government in the County of London has been in contemplation for a considerable number of years, but although a Royal Commission examined the question of the amalgamation of the City and County of London, the only Government Bill introduced on the subject since Sir "William Harcourt's Bill of 1884, was introduced into the House of Commons by the First Lord of the Treasury on the 23rd February, 1899. The measure was entitled, "A Bill to make better provision for Local Government in London." It proposed to create municipalities on the basis of the Metropolis Management Acts, to consist of a number of areas, each with a Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors, and to transfer to these municipalities all the powers and duties at present discharged by the Vestries and District Boards of Works and the powers of executing adoptive Acts. In the Bill, as introduced, a certain number of areas were included in the first Schedule as being those which in the opinion of the Government were fitted to be formed without further enquiry into Municipal Boroughs. The question was an extremely important one to the District, because the Government had in their declarations on the first and second readings of the Bill in the House of Commons intimated that they had determined to form an area to be known as Greater Westminster, which was to include the whole of the Districts constituting the Parliamentary Boroughs of the Strand, Westminster and St. George, Hanover Square, and as the Bill also provided that St. Marylebone and St. Pancras were to be included in the first Schedule and that the City of London was not to be 16 enlarged, it followed that the St. Giles District was one of those central areas which would have to be linked with some other district in order that it might (unless special reasons were shown) form part of a district the rateable value of which should exceed £500,000, or have a population of 100,000. The rateable value of the St. Giles District being only £441,815, and the population but 38,237, it immediately became apparent to the Board that an amalgamation of some other district with that of St. Giles was necessary in order to form an area convenient for administrative purposes. Communications were thereupon opened with the Board of Works for the Holborn District, who, after an opportunity had been afforded for a Conference being held of both Boards, unanimously declared themselves in favour of an amalgamation of the Districts of St. Giles and Holborn for the purpose of forming one Borough under the Act. A statement in support of these views was prepared and submitted to the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, the First Lord of the Treasury, and circulated among the metropolitan Members of Parliament, and, thanks to the invaluable services rendered by the Right Hon. Sir Charles Hall, K.C.M.G., Q.C., M.P., who was ably assisted by Sir Edward Clarke, Q.C., M.P., John Lowles, Esq., M.P., Walter Hazell, Esq., M.P., and other Members of Parliament who were interested in the proposed Borough, the First Lord of the Treasury, when the committee stage of the Bill was reached, intimated that the Government had determined that one of the areas to be included in the first schedule to the Bill should be the Parliamentary Borough of Holborn. 17 Into the details of the Bill it is not necessary to enter at any great length; since the introduction of the measure it has undergone considerable modification in details, and it is quite possible that before it reaches the committee stage in the House of Lords, other modifications will havetaken place. London County Council Water Bills. No less than four Bills were promoted by the London County Council, dealing with the question of supply of water to the Metropolis. The first of these provided for the purchase of the undertakings of the London Water Companies either by agreement or by arbitration. The second proposed to empower the London County Council to construct Reservoirs and Works at certain places in Wales; and to lay mains for the purpose of conveying the water to London. The third authorised the London County Council to construct Aqueducts and Works in the Counties of Brecknock, Hereford, Gloucester, Oxford, Buckingham, Herts, and Middlesex, with reservoirs in the latter county. The fourth was a finance Bill to authorise the Council to raise and expend money on Capital account for and in connection with the acquisition and construction of Water Works. The fate of the whole four Bills was the same, none of them have ever been read a second time up to the date when this report was printed. Great Northern and Strand Railway Bill. This Bill proposed to incorporate the Company and empower them to construct an underground railway from B 18 Wood Green in the County of Middlesex to a point just north of the Strand in the Parish of St. Clement Danes. So far as the St. Giles District was concerned the railway would have traversed beneath the public ways of Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, Bernard Street, Colonnade, Guilford Street, Russell Square, Southampton Row, and across High Holborn, and, passing beneath the public ways of Little Queen Street, would propose to follow the line of the new thoroughfare from High Holborn to the Strand. The only points on which the Board deemed it necessary to take steps were with a view of the insertion of a clause relating to the works, for the protection of the interests of the District, and an endeavour to cast upon the promoters an obligation to pay general district rates during course of construction. The Bill has been read a second time, and is waiting reference to a Select Committee. National Telephone Company's Bills. Three Bills were promoted by the National Telephone Company which were known as No. 1 & No. 2 Bill and the Telegraph Act 1892 Amendment Bill. The object of these Bills was to confer further powers upon the National Telephone Company and to enlarge the powers possessed by the Postmaster-General under section 5 of the Telegraph Act 1892, with regard to the execution of works which the Telephone Company might require. It is improbable that either of the Bills will be proceeded with this Session. 19 Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Bill. In the year 1893 an Act was passed authorising the construction of a Railway from Charing Cross to Euston with a branch to Hampstead. This Bill proposed to make certain amendments so far as the southern portion of the line was concerned, and as it did not in any way appear to interfere with the works proposed in the St. Giles District no action was taken in the matter. County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company's Bill. This Bill was promoted by the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, proposing to authorise the Company to construct Generating Stations, but as these works were not intended to be executed in the St. Giles District it was not necessary to take any action on that point, but the promoters of the Bill asked to be relieved by Section 15, of the obligation cast upon them by the Provisional Order granted by the Board of Trade for the lighting of the St. Giles District by which they were required to keep separate Capital and Revenue accounts relating to the area authorised by the Order. Instead of this, the Bill proposed to allow the keeping and making up one annual statement in respect of all their undertakings. The proposal was opposed, and the Bill was rejected by the Select Committee of the House of Commons to whom the same was referred. B 2 20 Central Electric Supply Company's Bill. This was a Bill promoted by the Central Electric Supply Company, Limited, which had been incorporated with the object of supplying electrical energy in bulk in certain districts in the County of London; but having regard to the result which attended the opposition of the Board to somewhat similar proposals by the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company in the Session of 1898, no action was taken on the Bill. Superannuation.—Metropolis Bill. This Bill, similar in terms to the one introduced in the Session of 1898, proposed to amend the Superannuation (Metropolis) Act 1866, with a view of bringing the provisions of that Act into line with the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act. The Board, in the Session of 1898, presented a petition in favour of the Bill, believing that the principle which it proposed to sanction was just and equitable, a view which was shared by many of the Metropolitan Authorities. In dealing with this Bill they unanimously passed a resolution in favour of it, and directed a communication to be addressed to the President of the Local Government Board urging that it should be passed into law. Metropolitan Streets Act 1867 (Amendment) Bill. This Bill was introduced by the Home Secretary with a view of enabling the Commissioner of Police to exercise 21 further powers with regard to the regulation of Street Traffic. The Bill did not call for any action on the part of the Board with the exception that a communication was sent to the Home Secretary urging that no bye-law which might be made should in any way fetter local authorities in the discharge of their duties relating to the removal of refuse, the cleansing of thoroughfares, and other statutory duties. Metropolitan Water Companies' Bill. This Bill was a Government Measure, brought into the House of Commons by the President of the Local Government Board with a view of giving effect to recommendations contained in the first report of the Royal Commission upon the subject of water supply within the limits of the Metropolitan Water Companies. The Royal Commission, in their interim report, expressed a decided opinion as to the desirability of communication being established between the various systems of the Metropolitan Water Companies. The Bill was introduced with a view of giving effect to these recommendations. Sale of Food and Drugs Bill. This Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by the President of the Board of Agriculture, Mr. Walter Long, M.P., with a view of amending the law relating to the sale of food and drugs. There is no more important question, 22 and none on which the law is in a more unsatisfactory state than that relating to the sale of food and drugs in a pure state. The Bill, as originally introduced into the House of Commons, was divided into three parts, the first relating to agricultural products, the second relating to the sale of food and drugs, and the third to supplemental matters At an early date after its introduction it was perfectly apparent that the measure would require considerable amendment before it could be passed into law, and at the time of preparing this report the Bill was under consideration of the Standing Committee on Trade, to whom it was, after second reading, referred. Metropolis Management Act Amendment (Bye-laws) Bill. This Bill was introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Monkswell, and proposed to confer powers on the London County Council to make Bye-laws under section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act with regard to the reconstruction of drains. Subject to certain amendments the Board expressed approval of the Bill, but owing to want of time the same was not passed; it has, however, been re-introduced in the present Session and has passed the House of Lords. Contracts for Dusting, Slopping, and Watering. The contracts for the removal of dust and slop and for street-watering, with Mr. George Cookson, were renewed 23 for a period of three years from the 25th March, 1899, on terms which were advantageous to the District. Obligations were imposed on the Contractor, prohibiting the user of the old pattern two-wheeled carts, compelling him to keep the vans in use in the district in a thoroughly cleanly condition, ensuring more prompt removal of refuse, and for a systematic washing of the wood and asphalte carriage-way pavements three times in every week. Electric Lighting. In the last report reference was made to the applications of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, and the Charing Cross and Strand Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, for Provisional Orders for the supply of electricity for lighting, motive power, and other purposes in the St. Giles District. The Provisional Orders made by the Board of Trade divided the District between the two Companies, a suggestion which was made by the Board. The Act confirming the Provisional Orders having been passed, the companies very shortly afterwards commenced their operations, and in so doing caused a very considerable disturbance to the public ways of the District, which was a subject of much complaint from inhabitants, who without doubt suffered considerable inconvenience. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. 467 samples of food and drugs were purchased and analysed during the year. 24 The Analyst's report which will be found on page 74 contains full particulars. It is sufficient here to remark that of the samples purchased, 28 were adulterated, but in eight cases the adulteration was not sufficient to justify any proceedings being taken; in the other cases prosecutions ensued, and fines and costs, amounting in the whole to £36 14s., were inflicted. The carrying out of this Act has been very much hampered during the past year by the decisions which have been given in various cases stated for the opinion of the Divisional Court. The most serious obstacle to a proper enforcement of the Act at the present time is known as the warranty question, upon which there can be no doubt as to the necessity for a strengthening of the law. Purchase of Freehold Property in High Holborn. During the year offers were made to the Board, on terms which were considered advantageous, for acquiring some freehold property in High Holborn in close contiguity to the Board's property, and being of opinion that it was desirable that advantage should be taken of the offer, the Board accepted the proposals, and with the consent of the London County Council, acquired the same with a loan borrowed from the Council, the Board believing that great advantage will accrue at an early date from their having secured these properties. Public Lavatories. The Surveyor of Taxes having made an assessment under Schedule (A) of the Income Tax Act in respect of 25 the Public Lavatory in New Oxford Street, the Board appealed to the Commissioners against the assessment, and urged that it should be withdrawn. After hearing the appeal the Commissioners declined to give effect to the Board's request. The question of what steps should be taken in the matter, with a view of obtaining a legal decision on the question, is under consideration at the present time. Sanitary Work. The monthly synopsis of Sanitary Work, which is forwarded to every member affords a useful record of the steps taken for preserving the public health in the District. Calculated on the information published month by month the following statistics are obtained :— Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Visits and Inspections made 10,940 Notices for Abatement of Nuisances served 896 Proceedings before Police Magistrates 89 Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, the premises, No. 21, High Street, which were closed in the year, having been made fit for human habitation were reopened In a number of instances it was found necessary to take proceedings before police magistrates for the abatement of smoke nuisances, in every instance convictions were obtained, but when application was made for the enforcement of penalties for breaches of the orders to abate, the Magistrates held that the evidence adduced by defendants 26 satisfied them that they had used all practical means in their power and had used due diligence for the abatement of the nuisances, and declined to inflict any penalties for the breaches of orders. Lodging House Regulations. Number of houses on the Register 618 Notices to abate breaches served 332 Proceedings taken 8 With a view of preventing the spread of infectious disease, the Board determined that in all cases where the Medical Officer of Health approved, the expenses of an examination of material from suspicious cases of infectious disease should be defrayed by them, and an arrangement was made with the conjoint Board of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons to undertake this work on virtually nominal terms. Renaming of Streets &c. During the year orders have, at the suggestion of the Board been made by the London County Council for renaming the following streets:— Little Coram Street and Little Guilford Street, and so much of the Colonnade, Guilford Street, in line therewith, incorporated under the name of Herbrand Street. Colonnade Mews, Guilford Street renamed Bolton Mews. Phoenix Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, incorporated with and under the name of Bucknall Street. 27 Employees' Holiday. The usual outing of the Board's Employees took place on the 25th June, 1898. The Board made a grant of £10, in addition to the men's wages, and were gratified to receive in due course from the Engineer a report stating that the outing had been much appreciated, and the whole arrangements had passed off satisfactorily.

Engineer's and Surveyor's Department, 197, High Holborn, W.C., June 13 th, 1899. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Report on the Works executed by the Board during the year ending 25th March, 1899. Pavings. Carriage-ways. Situation. Description of Paving. Net cost. Castle Street from Endell Street to Langley Street Redressed granite on concrete foundation. £ s. d. 303 0 1 High Street from Shaftesbury Avenue to Hampshire Hog Yard 2in. compressed asphalte on concrete foundation 578 16 11 Woburn Square, west side 3in. x 9in x 5in.

Yorkshire stone and repairs to granite kerb 89 5 9 Compton Street, from Hunter Street to Compton Mews New 3in. Yorkshire stone and repairs to granite kerb 60 13 4 Repaving of Compton Street. The St. Pancras Vestry, in February, 1898, addressed a communication to your Board to the effect that the Vestry was about to repave that portion of the carriageway of Compton Street, which was within the St. Pancras Parish with wood, and suggested the desirability of your Board paving the portion of the said street within the St. Giles District with similar material; this your Board agreed to do, and by arrangement the work was executed by the St. Pancras Vestry, your Board paying the sum of £81 6s. 4d. as the cost of the work within this District- 54 The footway paving on the South side of Compton Street, within the St. Giles District, was at the same time relaid and made good by the Board's Workmen—the net cost of the same being £60 13s. 4d. Repaying of Holborn Place. The thoroughfare known as Holborn Place, which so far as the carriageway is concerned, is a private thoroughfare leading from High Holborn to Whetstone Park, being in bad repair, the Owner was called upon, under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts, terepave the same. On his failing to do so the work was carried out by the Board's Contractors, and legal proceedings taken against the Owner for the recovery of the cost, which was then paid. Trinidad Lake Asphalt, and Cork Pavement. Several communications were addressed to the Board during the year, by the Trinidad Lake Asphalt Co., and the Cork Pavement Co., setting forth the advantages claimed by the respective Companies for their pavements, and asking the Board to give them an opportunity of laying specimens in some of the public ways within the District. The matter was referred to the Works Committee, who requested your Engineer to enquire into and report upon the respective pavings, which he did at considerable length on the 10th March, 1899. The Committee after giving full 55 consideration to the subject arrived at the conclusion that they were unable to advise the Board to adopt either of the pavements referred to, for use in the St. Giles District. The macadamised roadways in the District were recoated and repaired with broken granite, a steam roller being used where necessary to level the surface. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. During the year, contracts were entered into between your Board and the several Contractors who laid the pavements, for a further maintenance of the following streets for the periods and at the prices named:— Period. Per yard superficial perannum. s. d. Arthur Street 15 years 0 6 Marchmont Street 15 „ 0 6 Montague Place 15 „ 0 8 Shaftesbury Avenue 10 „ 1 4 Shorts Gardens 15 „ 0 4 Theobalds Road 10 „ 1 9 Drains. 130 applications were received during the year for the construction of new, and reconstruction of existing drains, at various premises within the District. The whole of the drains laid were tested by the Board's officials before being covered in; the fees received in respect of same amounted to £25 5s. 56 Sewers. The following Sewer works were performed during the year:— Great Queen Street, east end 222ft. run 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. new brick sewer constructed. Smarts Buildings 200ft. run existing sewer underpinned and repaired. Clarkes Buildings 253 ditto. Galen Place 125ft. run new 12in. pipe sewer constructed.

New manholes to existing sewers built. Cleansing Sewers. Certain of the sewers in the District which have dead ends, or in which the flow of sewage is not sufficient to enable the sewer to be self-cleansing, are fitted with flushing tanks. They are as follows:— Chapel Yard 450 gallons. Automatic selfacting syphon. Clarkes Buildings 600 do. do. do. Clarkes Mews 400 do. Slide penstock. Charing Cross Road 1,100 do.

The water used at the above tanks amounted to 727,000 gallons. The following sewers were flushed by water obtained from the New River Company's mains, through leather hose, during the summer months; the quantity of water used was 2,041,550 gallons:— Alfred Mews. Bainbridge Street. Bedford Avenue. Bernard Mews. Calsen Yard. Charlotte Mews. Church Passage. Compton Mews. Dunn's Passage. Galen Place. Gate Street. George Yard. Goldsmith Street. Gower Mews.

Woburn Mews. 58 The street gully pits, for intercepting solid matter which would otherwise enter the sewers, were emptied by hand labour, and their contents loaded into vans and taken away. The quantity thus removed amounted to 2,049 van loads; there were also 74 van loads of solid matter removed from the sewers, the total amounting to over 6,000 cubic yards. The pits after being emptied, were recharged with a solution of perchloride of mercury, for disinfecting purposes. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the District was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, numbering 50 men, and comprising 2 foremen, 4 gangers, and 44 sweepers. In addition to the manual labour employed, 2 sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the carriageways. The street sweepings carted away during the year amounted to a total of 6,461 van-loads, equal to over 19,000 cubic yards. The surfaces of the following public ways were flushed with water taken from the New River Company's mains mains through leather hose, the quantity of water used amounting to 8,246,616 gallons:— Bainbridge Street. Bernard Mews. Bucknall Street. Bloomsbury Court. Carrier Street. Castle Street. Clarkes Buildings. Denmark Place. Dunns Passage. Drury Lane. Eagle Street. Galen Place. Gate Street. George Yard.

Shorts Gardens. Middle Yard. Shelton Street. Monarch Yard. Stacey Street. Neals Yard. Tichborne Court. New Turnstile. Tower Street. New Yard. | Twyfords Buildings. Newton Street. Vine Street. Nottingham Court. Wild Court. Parker Street. The carriage-ways of all main thoroughfares were washed in the early morning during the year by means of water distributed by watering carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items for street cleansing and street watering, given hereafter. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year, including the Sunday work, was as follows:— Wages of men £3,561 12 2 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, etc., and clothing for men 551 15 6 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, removal of manure, etc., and hire of horses for street sweeping machines 3,529 14 0 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, etc. 19 10 2 Water for flushing surfaces of courts, etc. 217 13 7 £7,880 5 5 Street Watering. The watering of the public ways was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the District not available for 60 vehicular traffic, or which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used, including that used for washing the surfaces of the asphalte and wood-paved roads, amounted to 6,397,000 gallons. During the summer months, permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering carts, one ounce being used to 400 gallons of water. The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the market streets between 12 and 2.30, when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. In the latter watering, disinfectants were added to the water in the vans, during the whole of the year. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, etc., was £332 13 3 To Contractor for horses, carts, and drivers 1,030 12 0 For permanganate of potash 6 50 £1,369 10 3 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,650. The refuse removed amounted to 8,229 van loads, equal to over 24,500 cubic yards. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £9 16s. 3d. 61 Limewhiting Courts. The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, etc., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year at a cost of £24 10s. 1d.:— Calsen Yard. Neals Yard. Compton Mews. New Yard. Denmark Place. Nottingham Court Dunns Passage. Plummers Court. Halls Yard. Portsmouth Place. Henrietta Mews. Sardinia Place. Hunter Mews. Sardinia Street. Kennedy Court. Silver Street. Lascelles Court. Southampton Mews. Middle Yard. Woburn Mews. Underground Lavatories. In my last report I gave an account of a week's enumeration of the persons using the public Lavatories in the district during the winter in January and February, 1898. A second enumeration was taken last summer in the month of July, the result of which is shewn by the following table:— Table shewing the number of persons using the underground lavatories in the District from observations taken from the 11th to 17th July, 1898. Men's Lavatories. Total number using convenience in one week. Number using water closets. Number using urinals. Average per day of total. Shaftesbury Avenue 10,804 1,399 9,405 1,543 New Oxford Street 31,539 3,441 28,098 4,505 High Holborn 14,317 1,620 12,697 2,045 62 The number of persons using the urinals, were obtained by deducting those using the w.c.'s from the total. The persons using the lavatory basins were not considered, it being assumed that every person using them, also used either a water closet or urinal. In the women's conveniences, payment is required from all persons using them whether the w.c.'s or the lavatory basins, and the number of people is ascertained from the actual money receipts. Women's Lavatories. Total number using convenience in one week. Number using water closets. Number using lavatorybasins. Average per day of Total. Shaftesbury Avenue 476 465 11 66 New Oxford Street 2,498 2,328 170 357 High Holborn 618 576 42 88 Public Urinals. The urinal in Southampton Mews was removed on the 23rd November, 1898, the Mews then being closed as a public way. The following is a list of the public urinals above ground in the St. Giles District:— Compartments. Compartments. Colonnade 6 Seven Dials 6 Dunns Passage 5 Shorts Gardens 6 Galen Place 3 Torrington Mews 1 Little Guilford Street 4 Whetstone Park 3 The quantity of water used at the above ground urinals within the District during the year was 2,214,000 gallons. The quantity used at the underground lavatories was 3,979,000 gallons. 63 Public Lighting. The following are the number of public lamps within the District. 832 Lamps, circular, consuming ft cubic feet of gas per hour 96 „ square, „ 5 „ „ „ „ 149 „ do. „ 6 „ „ ,, „ 12 ,, square and circular 8 feet 2o ,, ,, ,, ,, 10 feet 9 „ „ „ „ 12 feet 18 „ square 15 feet 9 „ hexagon and square 20 feet 1 „ hexagon 27 feet 2 ,, „ 30 feet 3 ,, St. Giles Churchyard, circular 5 feet 12 „ spherical, hexagon and square Meter lamps 1168 The amount paid for gas, including lighting and extinguishing, and the cleansing and maintenance of the lanterns, was £4,577 3s. 8d. Incandescent Lighting.—Gower Street. On the 3rd February last, at a meeting of your Works Committee, it was resolved that the lamps in Grower Street be fitted with Welsbach double incandescent burners, with anti-vibration springs, without chimneys, in lieu of the existing batswing burners. This was done after considerable delay, owing to the inability to get the necessary fittings from the Welsbach Company, and it was not until the 20th March that these fittings were supplied and fixed, the lamps being put into lighting on the 27th March, 1899. 64 It was at once seen that although there was considerable improvement in the lighting of the street, the installation was imperfect in several respects, and the Gas Light and Coke Company, who supply the District with gas, declined to take charge of them. Alterations were accordingly ordered to meet the Company's requirements, which caused further delay, and it was not until the 22nd April that the necessary amended fittings were supplied and the installation completed. The destruction of mantles during this interval, through the absence of chimneys, was so considerable as to confirm the experience elsewhere obtained, that the use of incandescent burners in public lamps without chimneys is inexpedient—the opening the lanterns for relighting the flash-lights, when extinguished by vibration or otherwise admits a puff of air into the lantern, which immediately destroys the mantles, and it is impossible to avoid this destruction. The cleansing of the lant eras is also the cause of damage to the mantles, both by the admission of wind and by the workman's arm when cleaning the lamp, but after long consideration your Committee resolved to recommend the Board, to continue the experiment in Grower Street for a further term of six months, to obtain further results as to the breakage of mantles, and at the same time to make a further experiment with the incandescent light in Montague Place, and around the garden side of Bedford Square by fitting each of the existing lamps with one single Welsbach burner only, with a new form of chimney, known as the bulb chimney, the burner to consume 4.2 cubic feet of gas per hour. This recommendation was approved by the Board on the 9th May, 1899, and orders were immediately given to the Welsbach Company for the necessary fittings. These have just been supplied and are now being fixed. 65 Hydraulic Power Mains. Cast-iron pipes for the supply of hydraulic pressure have been laid during the year in the following streets in the District by the Hydraulic Power Company, Limited, permission to do so having been first obtained by the Company from the Board: — Cosmo Place. High Holborn. Russell Square. Woburn Place. Southampton Row. Electric Lighting. As referred to in the Report of your Clerk, the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation, Limited, and the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, obtained powers to lay mains beneath the public ways of the District, for the purpose of supplying electric energy for public and private purposes, the former company being limited to that part of the District which is south of the central line of New Oxford Street and High Holborn, the latter company to the District lying north of the said line. The Charing Cross Company commenced their operations in Great Queen Street in September, 1898, and have been laying mains from that date to this, throughout the various streets in their allotted district. The County of London and Brush Company did not commence operations until April, 1899, since which time they have been continually at work laying their mains. The works of these two companies have caused very great inconvenience to the public, and considerable labour to your Board and its staff in restoring and making good e 66 the paving and other works disturbed by the Companies operations. Street Refuges. No additional street refuges were formed during the year. The following is a list of those now existing in the District:- Bedford Place south end. Broad Street east of Endell Street. Charing Cross Road north end, by High Street. Do. by New Compton Street. Do. south end, by Cambridge Circus. Endell Street north end, by Broad Street. Guilford Street west end, by Russell Square.

The owners of the property surrounding various mews in the northern part of the District which were cul-de-sac, applied to the Board for their consent to the closing of the same to public traffic. The Board, after giving full consideration to the matter, resolved to permit these cul-de-sac to be stopped, and accordingly the following mews were closed on the dates named:— Owners of surrounding property. Date of closing cul-de-sac. Southampton Mews Duke of Bedford February 1, 1899. Montague Mews do. March 27, 1899. Henrietta Mews The Foundling Hospital March 1, 1899. Hunter Mews do. April 10, 1899. The paving materials, street-lamps, and the ironwork in connection with the sewers, were removed by the Board workmen before the closing, and were either disposed of on the site, or taken to the Board's stone yard. e 2 68 Board's Offices. In December, 1897, several slight cracks and signs of settlement made their appearance in certain portions of the Board's premises. Examination of them led to the opinion that they were caused by the operations of the Central London Railway Company, in the construction of the new railway beneath the public way of High Holborn. I accordingly communicated with the Company whose Contractors and Surveyors inspected them and had several interviews with me upon the matter, and the Company ultimately agreed to cut out and make good all the damaged work; this the Company did in the month of September, 1898, I accepting, on behalf of the Board, a money payment of £30 to make good the decorative work by your own tradesmen. St. Giles Churchyard. In March last, several of the footpaths in St. Giles Churchyard sunk considerably, and hollows were formed which held considerable quantities of water, and on searching for the cause it was found that the drains throughout nearly the whole lengths of the paths were in bad repair, and blocked with solid matter, caused apparently by the uneven subsidence of coffins and human remains in the soil, in which the drains were laid. It accordingly became necessary to take up and relay the whole of the drains, which was done by the Board's workmen at a cost of £81 12s. The paving over the trench has not yet been made good, time being allowed for the ground to settle, but the work of restoring the same will shortly be set in hand. 69 Widening of Shorts Gardens. In the year 1896 a proposal was considered by your Board for effecting a public improvement in Shorts Gardens at its entrance from Drury Lane by setting back the building at the south-east corner to range in line with the other houses in Shorts Gardens. Considerable negotiation took place at that time but with no result, the owner of the property demanding payment for the land proposed to be thrown into the public way at an amount the Board thought considerably in excess of its value for a public improvement, but during last year the property changed hands and came into possession of the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation, Limited, who acquired it for the purpose of a distributing station, and negotiations were opened by your Board with the Corporation with a view of effecting the desired improvement, and ultimately it was arranged that the Corporation should set back the frontage as described in consideration of the Board paying them the sum of £700. The Corporation's new building is now in course of erection to the agreed line, and when the work is completed the ground will be thrown into the public way and paved over by your Board. Towards the cost of the improvement a contribution of £100 has been promised by Messrs. Watney, Combe, Reid and Company, Limited, on the representation of the Clerk to the Board of the improved access which would be given by the improvement to their cooperage premises in Short's Gardens. 70 improvement—Portsmouth Street. The Public improvement in Portsmouth Street by setting back to the general line of frontage the George the Fourth Public-House, situate within the Strand District and the projecting shop front north of the said Public-House within the St. Giles District was agreed to with the owners and the new Public-House having been built, the hoarding enclosing the land adjoining has been set back to the new line of frontage, and the necessary works of repaving the widened carriageway and footways carried out. This, although but a small improvement, is one of an important nature, and has largely inproved the approach to King's College Hospital and the Royal Courts of Justice. Improvement—Herbrand Street. The improvement agreed to be carried out in Little Guilford Street and Little Coram Street has not yet been effected. The whole of the property on the West side of the street is demolished and Contracts have been entered into by your Board for the new paving works, but the Freeholder, the Duke of Bedford, has not yet made the necessary arrangements for setting back the hoarding, and therefore the matter remains as it did a year ago. Since this Report was in type I have received an intimation from the Architect to the Leaseholders of the land abutting on the west side of the street between Bernard Street and Great Coram Street that they propose 71 commencing the construction of the vaults beneath the widened public way next month, July. When this is done it will enable this portion of the new Herbrand Street to be widened and repaved. The following information with respect to the St Giles District may be of interest:— Its superficial area is 245 acres. Length of public ways, 15 miles 7 furlongs. Total length of public and private ways, 16 miles. The superficial area of carriage-ways is 47 acres, 1 rood, 247 yards. Do. do. footways is 24 do. 0 do. 321 do.

I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, G. WALLACE, Engineer and Surveyor. 74 ANALYST'S REPORT. Clerkenwell Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, E.C. 31st May, 1899. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act during the year ending the 31st March, 1899. The total number of samples examined during the twelve months was 469—a larger number than in the six preceding years, when the totals were as follows:— 1892-3 220 1893-4 266 1894-5 348 1895-6 318 1896-7 375 1897-8 406 Of the 469 samples submitted to me during the year, 467 were purchased by the Board's Inspectors, Messrs. William Henry Bond and John Robinson, who handed to 75 me 273 and 194 samples respectively. The other two samples were submitted by a private purchaser. In the following table will be found a summary of the articles analysed during each quarter of the year and their nature and quality. ARTICLE. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

The milk supply of the District, as in former years, has again received much attention, 246 samples of this article having been submitted for analysis. Of these seven were distinctly of poor quality. Eighteen samples were undoubtedly adulterated either by the addition of water, or by the removal of some portion of the fat. The percentage of adulteration was 7.9, the number for the preceding year being 10.8. The nature and amount of the adulteration in each case were as follows:— No. of Sample. Nature and Amount of Adulteration. 1st Quarter (ending 30th June, 1898). G 25 At least 24 0 per cent. of fat removed. G 31 do. 30.6 do. do.

It is a matter of considerable satisfaction that at length the Chemists of the Government Laboratory have admitted that the proper standard for fat in milk may be 3 per cent. For many years they adopted 2.75 per cent. as their standard, but on the most recent certificates which they have issued, the percentage of fat abstracted has been calculated for both numbers. This course is not all that might be desired, and it is to be hoped that before long they will see their way to use 3.0 per cent. only as the Standard. The warranty question is still in a most unsatisfactory state, and the new Food and Drugs Bill, now before the House of Commons, does nothing in its present form to improve it. Some stringent measures for dealing with the givers of false warranties are most urgently needed. Butter. 109 samples of butter were examined, seven of which proved to be adulterated (6.86 per cent.), the amount of foreign fat (fat other than the fat of butter) varying from 65 to 80 per cent. No. of Samples. Nature and Amount of Adulteration. 1st Quarter. G 387 At least 75 per cent. of foreign fat. 2nd Quarter. G 123 At least 80 per cent. of foreign fat. 3rd Quarter.

Both the Potassium Iodide prescription and the Mercury Pill had evidently been prepared with considerable care in every case. Pepper, Lard, &c. The remaining samples were all certified to be "not adulterated" and were for the most part of good quality. In conclusion I again venture to express a hope that the Government will see its way to include the formation of a Court of Reference in the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act now before the House of Commons. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. KEAR COLWELL. 79 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. CONTENTS. PAGE.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentleman, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report upon the Public Health, Sanitary Condition and Vital Statistics of the District, for the Registration Year ending the 31st December, 1898, a period of fifty-two weeks. I have proceeded in this report as far as possible on the same lines as adopted in those of previous years. Area. The St. Giles District comprises an area of 245 Statute acre3, nearly equally divided between the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury. For civil registration purposes it has been formed by the Registrar-General into three sub-districts, viz:— 1. St. George, Bloomsbury. 2. St. Giles, South. 3. St. Giles, North. Houses. No information was obtained at the quinquennial enumeration in 1896 as to the number of inhabited houses. 83 The number recorded at the Census 1891 was 3,729, and the average number of persons in each house was 10.2. At the Census in 1891 there were within the area of Registration London 544,977 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7.7 persons to a house. Population. According to the Census taken in March, 1896, the population was stated to be:— Males 18,563 Females 19,674 (excess over males 1,111.) Total 38,237 A decrease of 14,462 persons since the Census Enumeration of 1851. Marriages and Marriage-rate. 1898. Population (Census 1896). Number of Marriages. Marriage- rate per 1,000. St. Giles District 38,237 415 21.7 The marriages during the year numbered 415, compared with 371, 408 and 440 in the three preceding years. The 830 persons married were equal to an annual marriage-rate of 21.7 per 1,000, a rate of 3.8 per 1,000 higher than that of the decennial average 1888-97. The following table shows that of the 415 marriages, 213 were celebrated according to the rights of the Established Church, 27 according to the rights of the Roman Catholics, 22 took place in other places of worship, and 153 were civil contracts at the SuperintendentRegistrar's Office licensed for marriages. f 2 84 Name of Building.

This is the highest rate recorded in any year since 1877. In England and Wales the marriage-rate in 1898 was 16.2 and was higher than the rate in any year since 1876. Births and Birth-rates. Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1896). Number of Births. Ratio of Births to Population Birth - rate per 1,000. St. George, Bloomsbury 16,110 234 1 in 68.8 14.5 St. Giles, South 12,976 588 1 in 22.0 45.3 St. Giles, North 9,151 205 1 in 44.6 22.4 St. Giles District 38,237 1,027 1 in 37.2 26.8 85 Of the 1,027 births registered during the year, 533 were males, and 494 females. The excess of registered births over deaths was 281. The annual birth-rate of the District was equal to 26.8 per 1,000; this rate was 1.2 per 1,000 lower than the average rate of the decennial period 1888-97. The birth-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 35.8 being 21.3 per 1,000 higher than the rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The birth-rate of the Peabody Buildings, Great Wild Street (38.1) largely contributed to the high rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. In the whole of England and Wales the 922,873 births were equal to a birth-rate of 29.4 per 1,000, which is lower than that in any other year on record. (Registrar-General.) The natural increase of population, by excess of births over deaths, was 370,833. In London the estimated population middle of 1898 was 4,504,766. The annual rate of Births per 1,000 of the population was 29.5; the excess of Registered Births over deaths was 48,496, and the estimated increase of population during the year was 41,791. Deaths and Death-rates. 626 deaths were registered in St. Giles during 1898. Of these 325 were males, and 301 females. This number will not give a true death-rate, and must be altered by adding 205 deaths of parishioners in extraparochial institutions, and by deducting the 85 deaths of non-parishioners at the French Hospital, the Parish 86 Workhouse, and the British Lying-in Hospital, public institutions situated inside the District. The different corrections will be found in the following table. Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1896). Registered Deaths. Deaths (corrected). Ratio of Deaths to Population Deathrate per 1,000. St. George, Bloomsbury 16,110 158 217 1 in 74.2 13.4 St. Giles, South 12,976 314 371 1 in 34.9 28.5 St. Giles, North 9,151 154 158 1 in 57.9 17.2 St. Giles District 38,237 626 746 1 in 51.2 19.5 746 gives one death in 51.2 of the population, and is equal to an annual death-rate of 19.5 per 1,000, being 1.9 higher than the rate for the preceding year, and 1.6 below the decennial average. The death-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 23.9, being 10.5 higher than the rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. In England and Wales the 552,040 registered deaths corresponded to an annual death-rate of 17.6 per 1,000, which, compared with the average in the ten years 1888-97, shows a decrease of 0.8 per 1,000. In all London the registered deaths were 83,936, equal to an annual death-rate of 18.7 per 1,000 of the population, the average death-rate in the previous ten years having been 19.7. 87 Infantile Mortality. There were 243 deaths of young children; of these 158 were infants under one year, a number less than the average for the preceding three years. The diseases which produced the heaviest fatality were:—Prematurity, 31; measles, 26; bronchitis, 22; and diarrhœa, 19. The number of deaths under one year to 1,000 registered births was 153, in all London the proportion was 167 per 1,000; and in England and Wales the number was 161, which was 12 per 1,000 above the mean proportion in the ten years 1888-97. This rate is high, but in Ireland it is still higher, for in a paper on the mortality of children in Ireland (1886-1896) read before the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, Dr. Langford Symes states "that in the city of Dublin out of 1,000 children born 171.2 die in their first year, and in Belfast in every 1,000 total deaths no less than 519.8 are children under five years of age. We are not quite so bad in Dublin, but it is a reproach even to us that of our total deaths more than one-third are children under five (306.2 per 1,000)." Dr. Grimshaw, the Registrar-General of Ireland, in a paper on "Child Mortality in Dublin," traces it to the following causes: — 1, Poverty; 2, Inferior house accommodation for the working classes; 3, Drunkenness; 4, Carelessness. Senile Mortality. There were 165 deaths at 65 years of age and upwards, compared with 138, 152, and 173 in the three preceding years. 88 The deaths occurred at the following advanced ages: 43 between 65 and 70 years. 76 „ 70 „ 80 „ 44 ,, 80 ,, 90 ,, 1 at 92 years. 1 at 97 years. Only 48 were certified as deaths from "old age" and "decay of nature"; the remainder, 117, were returned as •deaths from disease, chiefly of the heart and lungs. Uncertified Deaths. 1898 is the fourth year in succession that no death has been returned in this District as "uncertified." Of the 83,936 deaths registered in London during the year 528 or 06 per cent were uncertified. In England and Wales, 10,334 cases or 1.9 per cent. were not certified. No action has yet been taken by Parliament to give effect to the recommendation of the Committee (1893) as to the sufficiency of the existing law for securing an accurate record of the true causes of death in all cases, especially for detecting them when death may be due to violence or criminal negligence. Consequently a large number of deaths are still returned as uncertified either by a Medical Practitioner or by the Coroner. Deaths in Public Institutions (within the District). 1.—The Parish Workhouse, Endell Street. The average number of inmates in the Parish Infirmary and Workhouse during the past year was 612. 89 The 130 deaths were equal to an annual death-rate of 21.2 per 1,000, compared with a death-rate of 21.4, the average for the preceding three years. The 50 deaths which occurred at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum are excluded from this calculation. 23 notifications of infectious cases were received, viz., erysipelas 22, and diphtheria 1. 2.-The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. This institution, which is situated within the district, continues to give valuable medical and surgical assistance to the sick poor, especially to the numerous foreigners who are located in Soho and the neighbourhood. During the past year, 42 deaths, occurred in the hospital; of these, 37 were non-parishioners. Five were infantile deaths and 5 were those of old people. There was no zymotic death, and only one slight case of infectious disease was notified. The majority of the deaths were caused from diseases of the heart and lungs. 3.—The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. The Medical Report for the year 1898 states "that 269 women were delivered in the wards of the hospital without any maternal mortality, and during the same 90 period, it is gratifying to note, an entire absence of puerperal fever." The total number of children born was 276, seven of the labours resulting in twin birth. 12 of the children (non-parishioners) were born prematurely. 411 women were delivered at their own homes and all did well. Section 1, subsection 5, of the Vaccination Act, 1898 applies to this and other lying-in hospitals as follows:— "Notwithstanding any regulation of any lying-in hospital or infirmary, or other similar institution, the parent of any child in any institution shall not be compelled under such regulation or otherwise, to cause or permit the child to be vaccinated at any time earlier than the expiration of six months from its birth." Deaths in Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums, Workhouse Infirmaries, and other places situated outside the District. According to the returns forwarded to me weekly from the General Register Office, Somerset House, the number of deaths of parishioners in the outlying public institutions &c., during 1898, was 205, the average number for the past five years 1893-97, being 219. 91 The deaths occurred in the following hospitals, &c.:— Institution. N umber of Deaths. Institution. Number of Deaths.

There were 8 zymotic deaths, viz., 5 from measles; and 3 from diarrhœa; these were equal to a zymotic death-rate of 5.8 per 1,000. Four notifications were received, viz., scarlet fever 3 and erysipelas 1. 21 of the total deaths were children under 5 years. B.— The Little Coram Street Block. Superintendent, Mr. J. Snelling. The average number of residents during 1898 was 752, viz., 635 adults, and 117 children under 5 years. The vital Statistics are shown in the following table:— Little Coram Street Block. 1898.

The two zymotic deaths, 1 from measles, and one from diarrhœa made a zymotic death-rate of 2.6 per 1,000. 18 notifications of infections disease were received, viz., scarlet fever 8, diphtheria 4, enteric fever 2 and erysipelas 4. Four of the total deaths occurred to children under 5. The thirty-fourth annual report of the Trustees of the Peabody Donation fund has been issued. The net gain of the year from rents and interests has been £35,721 10s. 4d. and the total fund on December 31st last was £1,256,167 11s. 5d. The capital expenditure on land and buildings to the end of the year was £1,250,390 10s. 8d. There had been provided for the Artizan and labouring poor of London 11,367 rooms, besides bath rooms, laundries, and lavatories. These comprised 5,121 separate dwellings, viz., 100 of four rooms, 1,767 of three rooms, 2,412 of two rooms, and 842 of one room. The average weekly earnings of the head of each family in residence at the close of the year was £1 3s. 1d. The average rent of each dwelling was 4s. 9¼d. a week, and of each room 2s. 2d. The rent in all cases includes the free use of water, laundries, sculleries, and bath rooms. The mean population during the year was 19,562, showing a density of 714 people to the acre, or nearly twelve times that of London. The birth-rate for the year reached 33.1 per 1,000, which is 3.6 per 1,000 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate was 14.7, which is 4.0 below the average of London, and the infant mortality 114.4 or 52.8 below that of London. 94 II.—Buildings belonging to the Incorporated Society for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes.

The one infectious death from measles was equal to a zymotic rate of 4.7 per 1,000. One case of diphtheria was the only notification received. IV—Buildings belonging to the London County Council. General Office, 9, Spring Gardens, S.W. Agent for the Council, Mr. Andrew Young. The birth, death, and zymotic death-rates for the years 1897 and 1898 are shown in the following table:— Shelton and Macklin Streets Buildings. 1897. 1898. Birth-rate 39.2 * - Death-rate 23.5 24.8 Zymotic death-rate 39.2 — *No return of the number of births has been given. 96 The number of residents during the year was 241, viz, 191 adults and 50 children under 5. There were 6 deaths, 4 adults and 2 children, equal to a death-rate of 24.8 per 1,000. There was no zymotic death. Deaths in Certain Classes of Diseases. Class 1.—Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases. This class of diseases, called "Zymotic," comprises in the Registrar-General's arrangement of the causes of death, six orders. The first and second orders ("miasmatic" and "diarrhœal") include the diseases which the Registrar-General describes as the seven principal diseases of the zymotic class; the term "fever" includes "typhus," "enteric or typhoid" and "simple continued forms of fever." * The zymotic death-rate is made up from these seven diseases, as they are considered to be more or less of a preventable character. In St. Giles' District there were 70 deaths, equal to a zymotic death-rate of 1.8 per 1,000, against 1.6, 2.2, and 2.0 in the three preceding years. In Registration London these diseases caused 12,482 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 2.77 per 1,000. In England and Wales 69,714 deaths were attributed to these diseases, corresponding to a rate of 22.2 per 1,000 living, against 2.21 and 2.17 respectively in the two preceding years. 97 MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—Small-Pox (decennial average, 0.6). Year. No. of Notifications Received. Removals to Hospitals. No. of Deaths in Hospitals. No. of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1898 - - - - - There has been no death from Small-pox in St. Giles District since 1895. During the past year no case of the disease was notified. The prevalence of Small-pox in London showed a further marked decline during 1898, when only one death was reported, the new cases notified being only 32 against 2,813, 1,192, 979, 22.5, and 104 in the five preceding years. The number of Small-pox patients admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals duringl898 did not exceed five, and no case remained under treatment at the end of the year. VACCINATION ACT, 1898. On the 12th August last an Act was passed to amend the law with respect to vaccination, enabling persons having "conscientious objections" to claim exemption from vaccination for their children. The important provisions are: Section 1. (1.) The period of vaccination is extended to six months from the birth of the child instead of three months as mentioned in the Vaccination Act of 1867. g 98 (2.) The Public Vaccinator shall, if required, visit the home of the child for the purpose of vaccinating it. (3.) If a child is not vaccinated within four months after its birth, the Public Vaccinator shall, after notice, visit the home of the child and shall offer to vaccinate it with glycerinated calf lymph, or such other lymph as may be issued by the Local Government Board. (4.) In case of the prevalence of infectious disease in the district, or in the house where the child resides, the Public Vaccinator shall give a certificate of postponement of vaccination, and also notice of such to the Medical Officer of Health for the district. Section 2. (1.) Is the exemption from penalties through conscientious objection. This Act, which will remain in force until the 1st January, 1904, will not come into operation in its entirety until 1st January, 1899; but the provisions of section 2 come into force on the date of the passing of the Act. 2.—Measles (decennial average 24.7). In 1898, there was an epidemic of measles over the Metropolis, which practically commenced in November, 1897, and continued to the middle of June, 1898. In this district there were 26 deaths, 24 being young children under 5 years; this number was slightly above the corrected decennial average. The deaths from this disease in all London were 3,075. 99 3.—Scarlet Fever (decennial average 5.2) Year. No. of Notifications received. Removals to Hospitals. No. of Deaths in Hospitals. No. of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1898 65 and 4 duplicates 46 1 1 2 There were 69 notifications and 46 removals to hospitals against 205 and 164 respectively in the preceding year. The 581 deaths from this cause in all London were also below the corrected average. 4.—Whooping-Cough (decennial average 17.9). Was the cause of 9 children's deaths as compared with 18, 13, and 13 in the preceding three years successively. 5.—Diarrhœa (decennial average 19.6). The 22 deaths from diarrhoea, 19 of which were those of children under 5 years, were slightly above the average. In all London diarrhoea was returned as the cause of 4,376 deaths, which were equal to a rate of 0.97 per 1,000, the highest rate recorded in any year since 1886. 6.—Diphtheria (decennial average 12.4). Year. No. of Notifications received. Removals to Hospitals. No. of Deaths in Hospitals. No. of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1898 46 27 5 1 6 G 2 100 The 6 deaths all young children were 11.8 below the decennial average. The notified cases were 46 as compared with 54 and 56 in the preceding years 1896-7. During the past three years there has been a lowering of the case mortality of diphtheria in London; the following table shows to what extent this has occurred.

The deaths from continued fevers in all London were 598, equal to a rate of 0.13 per 1,000, which was slightly below the decennial average. In July a letter was received from the London County Council enquiring whether the Board would be in favour of powers being conferred upon them to establish a laboratory or make such other arrangements as would enable Medical Officers of Health and Medical Practitioners to obtain at the expense of the County an examination of pathological matter by competent bacteriologists. This communication was referred to the Sanitary Committee, who considered the same and recommended the Board "that having regard to the importance of providing facilities for dealing with cases of infectious disease, the Board should in all doubtful cases of diagnosis, where approved by the Medical Officer of Health, incur the expense of a bacteriological examination of material from suspicious cases of infectious disease." Upon this recommendation being adopted negotiations were entered into with the Conjoint Board of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, who undertook to make the necessary examinations; and a communication was forwarded to the London County Council, that in the opinion of the Board it was unnecessary for the powers suggested in their letter to be conferred upon them. The following Regulations and Suggestions were drawn up and forwarded to the Medical Practitioners throughout the District:— 102 THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT, 197, High Holborn, W.C. Clerk's Department. 23rd January, 1899. Sir, I am directed by the Board to inform you that they have recently had under consideration the question of whether it was desirable that they should make arrangements by which Medical Practitioners in the District could obtain without expense to themselves, or their patients, examination by a competent bacteriologist of material from suspected cases of infectious diseases, with a view of aiding the diagnosis where the same did not clearly disclose the disease from which it was anticipated the person was suffering, and being of opinion that it is of great importance in the interests of public health, that every reasonable facility should be provided for promptly dealing with even suspected cases of infectious disease, the Board have made arrangements by which, in all cases where approved by the Medical Officer of Health for this District, they will be enabled to secure an examination of suspected matter at the Laboratory of the Conjoint Board of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. The conditions under which this examination will be made are as follows :— The examination will only be made on the written application of the Medical Practitioner called in to attend on any patient; such application to contain briefly the particulars of the case and to be transmitted to the Medical Officer of Health at this address. If the Medical Officer of Health is satisfied that the case is a proper one for the Board to bear the expense of the examination, sterilised tubes and swabs will be provided by him, and an order will be given with which the tubes and swabs should be transmitted to the Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, Examination Hall, Victoria Embankment, W.C. The fee will be paid by the Board. The result of the examination will be communicated to the Medical Practitioner through Medical Officer of Health, immediately on receipt of the report from the Laboratory. I enclose a memorandum prepared by the Medical Officer of Health as to tho taking of suspected matter. 103 The Board rely upon your cordial co-operation in giving effect to these arrangements, and I trust that you will see that no case in which the diagnosis is clear will be submitted. Either the Medical Officer of Health or myself will be happy to receive from you any suggestions, as to how the arrangements may be made most advantageous to the interests of the public health. I am Sir, Your obedient servant, HENRY C. JONES, Clerk to the Board. Bacteriological Examinations in suspected cases of Diphtheria or Enteric (Typhoid) Fever. Diphtheria. Place the patient in a good light. Remove the cotton wadding stopper from the tube containing the iron wire. Depress the tongue with a spatula, rub the cotton wadding pledget fixed at the end of the rod, gently, but firmly, against any visible exudate; or in other cases, including those in which the exudate is confined to the larynx, pass the pledget as far back as possible, rub it firmly against the mucous membranes of the pharnyx and tonsils. Still keeping the wire in one hand, withdraw the stopper from the tube containing the solidified blood serum, then rub the pledget once or twice over the surface of the serum, taking care not to break the surface in any way. Replace the plug, and then return the wire rod with its pledget to its tube, which also should be re-stoppered at once. Label the serum tube. Pack the two tubes in the box, taking care to put a little wadding at each end. Enteric Fever. To obtain the blood for diagnostic purposes from a typhoid fever patient, the best plan is to wash the lobe of the ear, or the back of the finger just below the nail, very thoroughly, first with soap and water, and then with any antiseptic solution that is handy, or, better still, after washing, allow a cloth soaked in a weak solution of an antiseptic to remain on the part until dry; then wash thoroughly with absolute 104 alcohol. If antiseptic and alcohol are not available, be all the more careful to wash the part thoroughly with warm water and soap, and then rinse with clean warm water. With a sharp protected needle—preferably lance-shaped—prick the lobe of the ear after compressing it, or the back of the finger, after constricting it just below the nail, as when drawing blood for ordinary blood estimation work. Take one of the small tubes from the test tube and draw up a sufficient amount of blood to fill or nearly fill, the small bulb; then draw the blood away from the point of the pipette and seal off in the flame of a candle or gas, or even of a wax vesta. Always obtain two such tubes if possible. Return these to the test tube and re-insert the cotton wadding plug. Pack the two tubes in a box, taking care to put a little wadding at each end. S. R. LOYETT, Medical Officer of Health. Infectious Diseases.—Notifications. The number of districts in which the system of notifi- cation is in force is 1,649, with a population of nearly 28,000,000 out of 1,821 districts with a population of 29,000,000. According to the report of the Statistical Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the year 1898, the grand total of notifications in London under the 55th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 37,316 against 45,415 for the previous year. In St. Giles District 229 Certificates, including duplicates, were received from Medical Practitioners. CHART SHOWING WEEK BY WEEK THE NUMBER OF CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE Notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the St. Giles District during 1898 105 They are duly scheduled under their several diseases in the following tables.

The Statistical Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board reports that 20,849 patients were admitted at their Fever and Small-pox hospitals from the several London parishes during 1898, against 22,964 received in the previous year, when a greater number of patients were treated than in any previous year, but the death-rate was the lowest on record. The number of patients suffering from infectious diseases removed from this District to the several institutions of the Asylums Board and the general public hospitals is shown in the following table:— Diseases. Asylums Board Hospitals. General Hospitals. Total. Small-Pox - - - Scarlet Fever 42 3 45 Diphtheria 15 12 27 Enteric Fever 8 6 14 *65 21 86 * The Report of the Statistical Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board gives 65 removals to their Hospitals, viz., Scarlet Fever, 39; Diphtheria, 8 Enteric Fever, 7; and other diseases, 11. The difference between the numbers, points to errors in diagnosis. 106 METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. Ambulance Service. Removal of Persons suffering from Infectious Diseases. 1.

Influenza is an intensely infectious disease. The deaths from it in St. Giles, which were 34, 1 and 6 in the preceding three years, were 12 in 1898. The Registrar-General reports: "The deaths referred to influenza during 1893, numbered 1,283, against 2,117, 491, and 699 in the three preceding years. Although the deaths from this disease in 1898 were nearly double those in 1897, they were below the average for the eight preceding years." II.—Constitutional and Tubercular Diseases. The diseases included in this important class are, cancer, phthisis, and the other forms of scrofulous and tubercular diseases. The total deaths from these several diseases in 1898 were 208, equal to a death rate of 4.1 per 1,000, against 70 zymotic or so-called preventable deaths, equal to a rate of 1.8 per 1,000. Phthisis or consumption alone caused 124 deaths, and was the most fatal disease of the year. In my annual report for the year 1896 attention was. directed to a number of important precautions suggested for the prevention of the continued propagation of tubercular diseases. The subject of prevention of consumption, which is attracting considerable attention in all directions, 109 has lately received a great impetus from the meeting of a number of representative men, held at Marlborough House, under the presidency of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, to further the objects of a National Association for the prevention of consumption and other forms of tuberculosis. The gathering was a notable one, and the objects of the newly-formed association were lucidly stated by Sir William Broadbent as follows:— (1.) To educate the public as to the means of preventing the spread of consumption from those already suffering from the disease. (2.) To extinguish tuberculosis in cattle. (3.) To promote the erection of Sanatoria for the open air treatment of tuberculous disease. III.—Local Diseases. The 375 deaths from local diseases, so named after the systems or organs to which the diseases relate, occurred in their order of fatality as follows:— Diseases of the respiratory system 139 do. do. nervous do. 7 3 do. do. circulatory do. 70 do. do. digestive do. 61 do. do. urinary do. 31 Other diseases 11 Bronchitis and pneumonia were reponsible for 134 of the deaths, 47 of these being young children under five years. 110 IV.—Sudden and Violent Deaths.

The causes of death may be classified as follows:— Deaths from disease 40 Deaths from violence Accidents 23 Suicides 7 1ll The following were amongst the causes of death returned by the Coroner:— M., aged 75. "Suffocation, a large piece of meat stuck in throat. Accident." F., aged 46. "Injury to spleen from falling through skylight to ground. Accident." M., aged 65. "Fractured skull from fall down stairs.

"Erysipelas of arm, poisoned wound in finger. Accident." The deaths in London attributed to violence numbered 3,514 as against 3,390, the corrected average number in the preceding ten years. The Public Mortuary, Goldsmith Street. During the year 60 bodies, including 4 non-parishioners, were brought to the Mortuary, the majority 50, at the request of the Coroner, who ordered post mortem examinations to be made in 30 of the cases for inquest purposes. 112 There was no body deposited on account of death due to infectious disease, though there is a chamber set apart for the reception of such cases. Bye-laws as to Houses let in Lodgings. (54 and 55 Vic., Cap. 76; Sec. 94, Sub-sec. 1.)

From a consideration of the serious mortality from tubercular disease and the known connection of tuberculosis with a bacillus which can by the adoption of proper means be destroyed, this section is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to consider the question "whether tuberculosis should be added to the list of notifiable disease, and what other effective steps should be taken with a view of reducing the mortality from this disease." (3.) That this section hears with regret that the Notification Act is not formally adopted in Ireland; and from a consideration of the material benefits that result to the public health from the notification of infectious diseases is unanimously of opinion that a representation should be made to the Government with a view of steps being taken to render the Act compulsory. (4.) That the section regrets that no steps have been taken in the Local Government Ireland Act 1898 to render the appointment of county medical officers of health obligatory upon county councils, and they feel that urgent representations should be made to the Government pointing out the serious disadvantages to the public health which naturally will result and the great disadvantages the people of Ireland thereby incur. (5.) That this section regrets to hear that infectious diseases are in some localities treated in connection with the general hospitals, and the members respectively submit that in the public health interest of the community it is urgently necessary that such treatment should 122 take place in separate and distinct institutions under proper public control. (6.) That this section is of opinion that the union hospitals in Ireland should be dissociated from the workhouses and that patients admitted to them for treatment only should not be compelled to do anything which would cause them to be classed as paupers. From section B the following resolutions were submitted:— (1.) That legislation is urgently needed for securing the supervision of all public water supplies in order to insure the provision of pure and wholesome water, and further, that it is desirable that sanitary authorities should be empowered to make bye-laws with reference to the construction and protection of private wells, and to enable them to close all wells yielding a water liable to dangerous pollution. (2.) That in the opinion of the section of Chemistry and Meteorology of the Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health the public convenience calls for the adoption of West European time instead of Dublin mean time as the legal standard time for Ireland. The section would urge that as Greenwich time has long since been adopted in the Postal Department, the principle should be extended, and that the necessary amendment should be made in the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act 1890, which provides that whenever any expression of time occurs in any Act of Parliament or other legal instrument, it shall be held in Great Britain to be Greenwich meantime, and in the case of Ireland, Dublin meantime. (3.) That this section approves the undermentioned recommendations with reference to legislation as regards poisons, and requests that a copy be forwarded to the Chief Secretary and the Lord Chancellor of England. (a) That " wholesale dealing " should be defined as:— 1.—A sale to a person qualified to sell by retail. 2.—A sale to a manufacturer for use in the process of his business. 3.—A sale to public bodies who usually buy by contract. (b) That the principle of qualification of the proprietor should not be departed from. (c) That poisonous substances recognised to be poison should be added to the poison schedule. 123 (d) That potent and seductive poisons in prescriptions should not be repeated except to the special direction of the prescriber. (e) That poisons may not be kept or sold in the shop or room in which groceries or excisable liquors are sold or kept, or in bottles in common use for the containing of beverages. (f) That a legal as well as a moral obligation should rest on the public as to storing and distributing poisons. The first and third resolutions were unanimously adopted. The second resolution was, after a show of hands, declared by the President to be rejected. The following resolution, submitted from the Municipal and Parliamentary section, was also carried: — "That in the opinion of this section it is desirable that all authorities having the power to appoint and pay public analysts should be empowered to appoint and pay a public bacteriologist." Sanitary Work. In Table VI. Appendix, there will be found a Summary of the Sanitary Work carried out during the year, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878 to 1891. Inspections and Orders. The Sanitary Inspectors made 11,246 visits and inspections and served 1,128 orders for the abatement of various kinds of nuisances, and the sanitary amendment of houses and premises. Legal Proceedings. In the majority of cases the nuisances were promptly abated, but in 48 instances where the Owners failed to 124 carry out the necessary works, legal proceedings were resorted to to enforce the Orders of your Sanitary Committee. Unsound Food. Quantities of Fish, Rabbits, Fruit and Vegetables which were unsound and unfit for the food of man were brought to the Stone Yard to be destroyed. Animals Improperly Kept. During the year complaints were received that a number of rabbits, fowls and dogs were kept in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious to health. Upon notices being served on the Owners the animals were promptly removed. Overcrowding. 22 notices were served upon Owners to reduce overcrowding in rooms. Most of the cases were discovered from anonymous communications; overcrowding is very difficult to detect as it is a common practice among the parents to conceal from the landlord and the Inspector the number of their children; overcrowding mostly takes place at night after the public-houses are closed, it could then often be discovered by inspection at unusual hours, which for obvious reasons should if possible be avoided. Underground Rooms. 10 underground kitchens used as sleeping-rooms were vacated when orders were served upon owners for their closure. 125 Factories and Workshops. Summary of Work done during 1898 under the Factory and Workshops Acts, 1878-1895, and under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, so far as it relates to Factories, Workshops and Workplaces.— Number of Workshops visited and inspected 119 Number of Workshops registered during the year 77 No of Persons employed in registered Workshops:— Males 140 Females 72 Young Persons 23 235 No. of Orders served:— Water closet accommodation 20 Dirty condition of premises 7 Overcrowding 2 Other nuisances 3 32 Notices sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories under section 27 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 4 Complaints received from H.M. Inspector of tories as to overcrowding or insanitary condition of Workshops 2 Slaughter-Houses. At a special meeting of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the London County Council, held on the 24th October, the following licenses were renewed for slaughter-houses:— Locality. Licensee. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. C. Shortland. No. 23, Store Street Mr. Wm. Kingmill. There has been a progressive decline in the number of applications for the license of Slaughter Houses in London in each of the last seven years, and the number now 126 licensed amounts to only 4.56 or about 200 fewer than in 1891. (Report of the Medical Officer of Health of London for 1897.) Cow-House. At the same meeting the Committee of the London County Council, the license was renewed for the undermentioned Cow-shed:— Locality. Licensee. Dimensions of Shed. No. of Cows Allowed. No. of Cows now in Shed. No. 4, Goldsmith Street Mr. E. Jones 7,246 cubic feet. 9 4 In 1856, the usual number of cows in the several sheds in the District was 157, in 1898 the number was four.
