Prefatory Note. 3 Saint Beorge the Martgr, Sonthwark. TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE YESTRY. PREFATORY NOTE. The Paying of the Carriageway of the Old Kent road in this Parish has now been some time completed. As the repayment by Annual Instalments of the loan, by means of which this was effected, proceeds, and the Interest thereby becomes less, the burden on the parochial funds of this expensive thoroughfare will gradually be diminished. The arrangements for completing the paving of the carriage way in the London Eoad have been delayed by the efforts of the Vestry to ascertain some system of Tramways free from the defects which characterize all those hitherto brought under their notice. From [the very favorable statements submitted to them respecting a Tramway laid at Salford the Vestry to prevent the possibility of mistake decided to send a deputation thither to learn, by inspection on the spot, the practical working of it. In the result it was found to have been laid for the use of Omnibuses furnished with a fifth or guide-wheel adapted to a grove in the middle rail; and the unanimous report of the deputation was (in effect) that while it appeared admirably adapted for the purpose for which it was intended, both it, and any adaptation of it, would for reasons given in the Report, be decidedly unsuited for a street of such traffic as the London Eoad. The Deputation subjoined the important statement, that the conclusion, forced upon their minds by the investigation, is, that, on account of the risk of being mulcted in damages which arises when any accident occurs through smooth iron being laid in the public way, that material should not be so employed unless and until the sanction of the Legislature be previously given thereto. The paving of the Eoad with Granite Cubes may be expected very shortly to be completed. The Annual Eeport of the Medical Officer of Health and the Statistical Tables which as usual will be found accompanying it while they shew the actual Sanitary condition of the Parish, testify also the strong desire cherished, and the strenuous efforts made, to improve, in all matters affecting the Public Health, the populous district under the charge of the Yestry. During the year has emerged from Chancery a small Charity called Dickinson's Charity in which this Parish is interested. The scheme for the future management of the Charity and some other particulars relating to it, will be found on a subsequent page. On application at the Yestry Clerk's Office Parishioners will be supplied with a copy of this Eeport. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk.

Notice of every meeting, whether general, special, or adjourned, shall be given in writing to each trustee three clear days at least before the time appointed for holding the same, which notice may be delivered at the residence of each trustee, or be sent by post. The notice of any special meeting shall specify the object of the meeting, and no business shall be transacted at such meeting other than that which shall be specified in the notice. 7. At every general and special meeting five trustees shall form a quorum, and so soon after the time appointed for any meeting as a sufficient number of trustees shall be in attendance to form a quorum the trustees present shall elect a chairman, and in the event of an equality of votes on tho olection of chairman the question shall be decided between persons proposed by lot. The acts and proceedings of a majority of votes at any meeting properly held shall be binding on the whole of the trustees, but the trustees or a majority of them, present at any subsequent meeting duly held and constituted as aforesaid, shall have power from time to time to alter, vary, or rescind any resolution or direction which may have been come to or given at any previous meeting. The chairman of every meeting shall, in the event of an equality of votes, have a second or casting vote. 8. If there shall not within the space of half an hour from the time appointed for holding any meeting be a sufficient number of trustees in attendance to form a quorum, or the business of jany meeting shall remain undisposed of, the trustees or trustee present, or if no trustee be present then the clerk may adjourn the meeting until some subsequent day, of which adjournment such notice shall be given as hereinbefore directed. 9. The trustees may at any general or special meeting appoint two or more trustees to be a committee for the purpose of making any enquiry, or superintending or performing any specific act or duty which in the judgment of the trustees would be more efficiently executed by such committee, but the acts and proceedings of such committee shall be submitted to the trustees at their next general meeting. 10. The trustees shall provide a minute-book, wherein shall be entered a minuto of their proceedings at every meeting, which minute shall be signed by the chairman of the next succeeding meeting. They shall also provide all necessary account-books, wherein shall be entered an account of their receipts and payments on behalf of the charity. 11. The trustees shall from time to time let and demise the charity property at the best annual rent or rents that can reasonably be obtained for tho same, either from year to year or for any number of years not exceeding twenty-one years, in possession and not in reversion, and without taking any fine or premium. On the granting of any such demise and on the granting of any lease the lessee shall execute a counterpart thereof. All leases shall Dickinson's Charity, 23 tain covenants with the trustees for the due payment of the rent, the proper cultivation of the land, the repair and insurance of the houses and buildings comprised therein, a proviso for re-entry on non-payment of rent or non performance of the covenants, and all other usual and proper covenants applicable to the property which shall be the subject of the lease. 12. All cheques and orders for the payment of money shall be signed by the chairman at one of the meetings of the trustees, and by two of the other trustees present at such meeting, and shall be countersigned by the clerk. 13. The trustees shall appoint as their banker some fit and responsible person or persons who is or are carrying on the business of a banker, or some joint-stock banking company, with whom shall be deposited all moneys belonging to the charity, and they may change such banker as they may see fit. 14. The trustees shall out of the income of the charity make the following annual payments : that is to say, to the minister of the parish of St. Stephen, Walbrook, in the City of London, for the time being the sum of 20s., in consideration of his preaching a sermon in the same church, on Good Friday in the forenoon ; to the clerk and sexton of the said parish, for their attendance, twenty-pence each, and to the churchwardens of the parish of Ewell, in the county of Surrey, the sum of 40s., to be by them distributed in the month of March amongst the deserving poor of the said parish not receiving parochial relief. The residue of the rents and profits of the charity property shall be applied by the trustees in providing apprentice fees for poor children, to be selected in regular rotation from the said four parishes of St. Sepulchre, St. Giles-without-Cripplegate, St. Olave, Southwark, and St. George, Southwark. No child shall be selected to be apprenticed whose parent or parents shall within one year previously have been in the receipt of parish relief. The premium shall not exceed £20 in any case, and shall be paid in such proportions and at such times as the trustees shall in each case think fit to direct. 15. The trustees shall preserve in a book a list of the children for whom apprentice fees shall be provided, containing also the names and station in life of their parents (if any), the names of the persons to whom the children shall be apprenticed, and the amount and date of payment of the apprentice fees. 16. A fair and authenticated copy of this scheme shall be kept with the documents belonging to the charity, and a duplicate thereof shall be sent to the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, and the trustees shall from time to time take such steps as they may think necessary to cause the provisions of this scheme and the purposes to which the income of the charity is applicable to be known in the said four parishes- Dated this 12th day of June, 1867. I approve of this scheme, and direct that the same be filed at the Record Office. ROMILLY, M.R.

Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1868. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have again the honour to present you with a report of the sanitary condition of the district, and with the number of the births and deaths that have occurred during the year, as well as the diseases which have caused those deaths. That a considerable similarity should exist in these reports will not occasion surprise, when you remember that the subject always remains the same, and that the number of deaths, and the kind of diseases only vary. Besides, the year now ended, has passed quietly and smoothly away. No cholera or other epidemic, has happened to scare us out of our usual course, and distinguish it from other years. Taking the experience of the past for our guide, cholera might reasonably have been expected. Hitherto, the disease has appeared in the autumn of one year with a few scattered cases, to burst out in all its uncontrollable fury in the following year. Such indeed, has been the case on the Continent. That this has not been so here, much credit, I think, is due to the Vestries of London. They did promptly and zealously all that they could, to prevent and break up this usual train of events. "Medicine," says a celebrated writer, "has tried her skill in vain, and in vain has the devotee offered up his prayers; only has Hygiene effectually intervened between pestilence and its victims." As her true disciples, you have faithfully and diligently carried out her behests, and the result has shown reasonable cause for gratulation. During the time which wo are now contemplating, many measures have boon passed in Parliament, showing a desire to improve the health and comfort of, the people. There was the Metropolitan Poor Act; Vaccination Act; Factory Acts Extension; Agricultural Gangs Act; Traffic Regulation Act; and Hours of Labour Regulation Act. The tendency of these measures is good; but their practicability is, I fear, remote. To carry them out fully, will require time. Undue haste, and harsh conduct, will rather injure than help the 33 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1867—8. people. Laws may be good, in the abstract, but oppressive in their operation. No specific exists, whereby the evils from which we suffer can be made void. The struggle will have to continue as long as man lives. It is not only in large towns that sanitary evils are met with, but in every region round about. Many a picturesque village perched on the hillside, or lying quietly in the deep and silent valley, is defaced with sanitary defects, unknown even in our towns and cities; and is only kept free from disease by the pure air ever blowing over it. But this even does not always avail to keep at bay fever and other epidemics. We seem in the position of the Alpine traveller, who thinks he sees the end of his ascent, and will soon exultingly stand upon the topmost height. But no sooner does he reach the fancied summit, than he finds there is still another, and another, until hope almost fails. Thus it is with us. Grave nuisances that towered high, and cast far and wide their baleful shadow, we once thought had only to be cast hence, and all would be well. These gone, we find that they only hid others still more formidable, and more enduring. Many belong not to the surroundings of man, but to the constitution of his moral and intellectual powers. And hence, for any real and lasting good we require an improvement in the human race, "We are fired with the hope to reform man. After many experiments we find that we must begin earlier—at school. But the boys and girls are not docile; we can make nothing of them. We must begin our reform earlier still—at generation." To reform man, moral and hygienic measures must go hand in hand. They cannot be divided without injury to the cause they are intended to benefit. Morality doubtless does depend upon the sanitary state of a people. How can a man develope his moral powers whilst living in the midst of filth and dirt; with all the associations by which he is surrounded, tending only to imbrute his mind? Whilst on the other hand it is true that "the moral governs the economical in the condition of man;" and that his happiness, and the prosperity of the nation of which he forms a part must ever depend upon his character. Alternately, they are related as cause and effect. When united the circle is complete. TABLE No. 1.

There have been three years in which the mortality has been less than that of 1867, namely, 1858, 1859 and 1860. In 1858 there was one death less; in 1859, 29; in 1860, 120. In 1864, 349 deaths were registered in excess of 1867. The population, we must remember, has increased; besides, overcrowding 34 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. exists to a greater degree than ever, owing to the destruction of houses, and great increase of rents. Putting aside, however, this view of the matter, no one who remembers what London was a few years ago, with its foul open ditches, its multitudinous cess-pools, its scanty supply of impure and disease-propagating water, its bad roads, unflagged pathways, and unregulated slaughter-houses and cow-sheds, can hesitate for one moment to acknowledge how great has been sanitary advance. But going farther back in time, and contrasting the rate of mortality then, with the rate of mortality now, the decrease becomes strikingly manifest. In Southwark during the ten years 1660-9, the range of the death-rate was from 70 to 80 per 1000; whilst in that of the ten years 1858.67, the range was from 21 to 36 per 1000. "A review of the Tables," writes the Registrar General in his Summary of Weekly Returns of Births, Deaths, and Causes of Death in London during the year 1867, "justifies the observation that in none of the London Divisions are the signs of sanitary improvement more legible than in the southern section." The births of 2058 children were registered in the year, 14 in excess of 1866-7. Of the births registered 1063 were male, and 995 were female children. Whilst the births of males were in excess of females, so likewise were the deaths. The total number of deaths registered in the year 1867-8 was 1352, of which 723 were males, and 629 females. The most fatal quarter of the year was that ending December, and the least fatal that ending June. This comparison does not always hold good. TABLE No. 2. Week. Kent Road. Borough Road London Road.

The decrease is chiefly due to the diminished rate of mortality from smallpox. The deaths from that disease were little more than half, when compared with those of 1866-7. It has been stated that Jenner's discovery has saved 80,000 lives annually. That 80,000 have not died from small pox may be very true, but that they have been saved is doubtful. Vaccination closes one avenue to death, but many more are open. There is a vicarious mortality. The weak and ailing whom small-pox would have destroyed, perish in their struggle with some other disease; hence the increase of deaths from scarlatina, whooping cough, and the like diseases. This need be no cause for lamentation; for as long as beings with degenerate organisation are born amongst us, it is necessary for the safety of our race, that they be swept away. Whooping cough has been pre-eminently fatal, 67 deaths being referred to that disease. Next in degree of fatality follows diarrhœa, which caused 58 deaths. Only in two years of the last five has this disease proved more fatal; and these were 1863-4, and 1865-6. The deaths from fever were 34. In London there were registered 2174 deaths from this disease. Siphilis was fatal in 15 cases, and most were infants. For arresting the spread of this subtle and terrible disease, the Contagious Disease Act was passed. Besides this, another Act was passed last session (1867), whereby the Guardians are empowered, on a certificate of their Medical Officer, to retain in the workhouse any inmate suffering from this disease, so long as they cannot leave without danger to themselves or others. "On the whole," says Sir William Jenner, "I believe that among all preventible diseases, there is not one which is the cause of so much misery and loss of life." It predisposes to many other diseases, especially consumption and scrofulous affections. It is the companion and curse of civilization. 37 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1867-8. Whether it rests within the compass of man's power to rid the world of the sources from which Zymotic diseases take their rise I know not. The poison germs may be present every where; they may be carried on or in water; they may adhere to walls, clothing, and bedding; they may float idly about in the atmosphere, but if no suitable soil be prepared for them whereon to settle, and work out their results, then no more consequences would follow than if good seed were scattered upon the brown and naked rock, or upon the dry and parched sand of the desert. The fact is certain, that the extent and mortality of Zymotic diseases will always be found to correspond with the social and sanitary condition of a people, rather than upon the strength and power of the epidemic. The International Sanitary Conference, which met in Constantinople in the beginning of the year 1867, anticipated a period when the minds of all men would be penetrated with the truth, that most endemics and epidemics owe their violence and spread to the massing together of people, and to the fatal customs prevalent amongst them—a period, when all shall understand that it is in the power of man, at the same time that it is his duty, to overcome by his efforts, that condition which he has created by his ignorance. The conference asserted that if man was to be preserved from cholera epidemics, he must live on a clean soil, drink pure water, and breathe a pure atmosphere. "The preventive power" of disease "which we possess, is amongst the happiest possessions of science." TABLE No. 6. 1863—4 1864-5 1865—6 1866—7 1867—8 Phthisis 222 181 202 211 184 Bronchitis 203 177 132 165 137 Pneumonia 106 130 119 110 60 To constitutional diseases were referred 305 deaths. This class consists of two divisions; one only of which will demand our attention. This includes that most fatal of all diseases, consumption, as well as tabes, which destroyed 76 persons, 74 of whom were under five years of age; as well as hydrocephalus, a disease also fatal to children. Consumption has caused 184 deaths; the lowest number that has happened in five years, except the year 1864-5, when they were three less. A curious and very important fact has been brought to light with reference to this disease, by Dr. Buchanan. He found, whilst on his search into the results of the sanitary improvement in English towns, that the drying of the soil, which has followed in most cases from the laying of main sewers, has led to a considerable diminution of this disease. At Leicester it was observed that when a diminution occurred in the subsoil water, a corresponding reduction was observed in the consumptive death rate. Clearly some intimate relation exists between the subsoil water and consumption. I need not say that the mortality of other diseases is also influenced to a greater or lesser degree by efficient drainage. Any knowledge which may tend to diminish the ravages of consumption cannot be too widely known, consequently I think it right to inform you, that it is the opinion of a modern writer, that if we avoid breathing the same air over again we cannot incur the disease; but that if we breathe the same air again we cannot in the long run avoid it. Simply by shunning re-breathed air, tubercular and tubercle induced maladies may be got rid of for ever. Granting the result should not be so complete as here 38 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. told us, yet it would be well to put the teaching into practice, not only for health's sake but also for the sake of cleanliness. The air after being used in the lungs, is like water after having been used for washing, only fit to be got rid of as fast and as effectually as possible, and not retained by closed windows, boarded fire-places, and listed doors. If we could only see its foulness we should need no exhortation to allow its escape. Under the class Local Diseases, are included the affections of particular organs of the body, whether assailed by inflammation or by mere functional derangement. Two hundred and twenty seven deaths from the brain and nervous system were recorded. Disease of this kind is steadily upon the increase. The number of deaths during the last five years have been as follows: 189, 197, 198, 211, and 227. This gives cause for reflection. The opinion is also daily becoming more confirmed and general, that insanity is upon the increase; an increase outrunning the increase of the population. It is an established fact, that insanity reaches its highest point amongst civilized communities. City life, with all its struggles, anxieties, mental excitement, late hours, vices and pleasures, is one of the main causes. Mental culture has also been greatly increased of late years, and that not equally. The reasoning powers have been left too much in abeyance, whilst the emotional have been unduly excited. This unfortunately has been too much the object with many of our popular preachers and writers. Manly exercises were once considered the foundation of that elevation of mind, which gives one nature influence over another. Now physical force is becoming less and less necessary. The strong-brained have supplanted the stronglimbed. The intellect has become the highway to wealth, position, and power. Diseases of the lungs (consumption excluded) exhibit a considerable diminution in their mortality. Two hundred and twenty deaths are attributed to them, and these were chiefly owing to inflammation of the air passages and cells. They cause about 40 per cent. of the mortality. The seasons increase or diminish their mortality to a remarkable degree. "The difference between winter's cold and summer's heat," says Dr. Farr, "will cause a loss or saving of 800 lives in a week." Sanitary neglect and want of personal cleanliness add to their fatality. It is these diseases which make our winter mortality so high; hence the necessity of careful protection against cold. Teething destroyed 15 infants, and to premature birth and debility were attributed 51 deaths. Suffocation was the cause of 15 deaths; 12 of these were infants, and were found dead in bed, with one exception; this exception was an infant which had been wrapped up in a shawl so carefully, that when the shawl was opened it was found smothered. A new-born infant was found dead in West Square. A male, aged 42, was found suffocated in the bed clothes, and a female, aged 72, perished from the same cause, by falling backwards and forcing her head upon her chest. Injuries to the brain gave rise to 8 deaths. The falling of the shafts of a cart killed a girl, aged 4 years; and upon a male, aged 63, a pocket of hops fell; the others died from falls, or from being run over. A woman, aged 42, was killed by falling into the sewer in Westminster-bridge-road. A girl, aged 2 years, was poisoned from drinking paraffine. Two females were burnt from their clothes taking fire, aged respectively 20 and 67 years. Four persons committed suicide. A male, aged 64, hung himself; another, aged 60, poisoned himself by taking laudanum; and a third by taking prussic acid; a female (insane) set fire to herself with a lucifer match. Seven persons died whose ages had reached and passed four score years and ten ; two were aged 90, one 92, 93, 94, 95, and 98. 39 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1867—8. TABLE No. 7.

The Table will show the number of tons of solid impurities in 100,000 tons of the water of the Lambeth and Southwark Companies. Our supply remains intermittent. It seems, however, that some of the water companies have expressed their desire to work with medical officers of health "for improvement in the water supply of the poor," and that "they are quite prepared on the single condition of effective provision being made against waste, to add to the number of main supplies." Messrs. Beggs & Son, Southampton-street, Strand, have manufactured what they call "double valve water waste preventers," which they assert will answer every demand that can be made. They are simple in construction, and cannot easily be disarranged. They have one which is intended for passages and courts, or such like places, and which can be fastened against the wall or other place by means of a bracket. This will deliver about 2½ gallons each time, and the cost is 36s. To landlords having blocks of houses, the erection of these would be far better, as well as cheaper than water-butts They might almost supplant butts. And what a benefit they would prove; water always on, cool in summer, and no pipes to freeze and burst in the winter; besides obtaining the water as pure as it leaves the reservoirs. Provincial towns are better supplied, and with purer water than is the metropolis Thousands of pounds are spent every year in London, which would be saved, were the water as soft and free from impurities as it ought to be. The intermittent supply besides its inconvenience and incompleteness, involves other dangerous liabilities. Dr. Frankland tells us, that in addition to the well known evils attending the storage of water in butts and cisterns, there is the danger of the leakage of sewage into the pipes whilst the pressure is withdrawn. He found in some drawn from the West Middlesex Company rather more than one per cent. of fresh sewage. It came out on inquiry that a leakage had occurred in one of the mains near a gully hole: consequently when the water pressure was removed from the main at night, the sewage gained access into the interior. No chance should exist for an accident like this to happen. Putting aside the nastiness of the thing, we are incurring great danger in ordinary times of fever, and in extraordinary times of cholera. The bake-houses have been visited twice during the year, and the slaughter-houses and cow-sheds once, according to the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act, and the Bake-house Regulation Act. 40 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

It will be found that where poverty and over crowding exist, these diseases abound. Indeed poverty and over crowding are but convertible terms. It seems to me that the tendency of the present day is to lessen human responsibility; and make man good upon compulsion; to bring about by outward force, that which ought to spring spontaneously from within. As men in the affairs of life will not act with integrity and honor, why then means must bo made to compel them. For every vice we shall soon have a law. This is sad, after so many centuries of teaching and preaching. "What higher morality we seem to possess, when compared with the past, appears to bo produced, not by greater love of virtue, but by the greater perfection of the police." Man must bo made, in some measure, his own healer and helper. Improvement must proceed from himself; and for this end his responsibility should bo increased, and education in its widest and fullest sense extended. Sanitary knowledge is extremely limited; and where possessed, seldom practised. One of the most neglected of sanitary duties is ventilation; and yet it is one of the very utmost importance, as I have previously shown. How many of our public rooms, churches, and chapels exhibit the greatest heedlessness in this respect; and not for want of means so much, as from a foolish fear of draughts. Some of our places of worship when full, and the gas is burning, are positively noxious. The greatest pains are taken with reference to the health and comfort of the hearers, in most of our public places of amusement; and surely every thing connected with religious worship ought to approximate as nigh as possible to perfection. Besides, how is it possible to gain the attention and consent of the lower and ignorant classes to this matter, when the upper and intelligent classes are so careless about it. The result of what massing together human beings will ultimately load to, is now being tested to the utmost. Little garden-plots, green spots, open spaces, are absorbed and 42 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. lowed up one after another, and houses are covering them. If instead of long and monotonous streets of low houses, which must soon become the habitations of wretchedness and vice, loftier houses were built, in flats, and with numerous open spaces, we might anticipate a better future. Apparently, however, each builder does that which seems good in his own eyes, and we must submit. I have often wondered at the indifference manifested by Government. Such was not the case with that of old Rome. The utmost care and watchfulness was shown in tho erection of houses, both as regarded their position and structure, so that they might not become the haunts for disease and crime. Shall the Christian City, in the performance of such important duties, lag behind the Pagan City ? The building of proper habitations is the greatest want of the time, and the very basis of sanitary improvement. Without this, our labour is despoiled of more than half its benefits. The placing of a block of houses here and there is of no avail, except perhaps to show tho greater need of them. It is high time something should be done; and I earnestly hope that tho bill now before Parliament to provide better dwellings for artisans and labourers will be tho commencement of a better era. If modified and carefully carried out, it may prove one of tho most efficient sanitary measures yet passed. There will, however, be many and great obstacles, the chief being poverty. A man will not build unless he can see that he shall be remunerated for his labour and outlay. How can he pull down old bouses, and build now ones, and the rents not be increased ? To increase rents will render almost nugatory the good done. I say, now, as I have said before, that I do not believe suitable houses can be built for the poor which will pay. The philanthropist halts here, and the capitalist will not advance. How much might be done by those who have been set upon the high places of the earth, did they consider what their position demands. The gulph now widening between the rich and poor might then be bridged over. Many of the localities in our parishes, and not only in our parishes, but in other parishes out in the open country, upon which stand buildings that are a disgrace and a curse to the age, belong to the wealthiest of the land, yet, they heed not. Apparently they have abdicated those duties which the possession of property involves. There is certainly need of greater sympathy between the various classes which form our social condition. Justice may be most rigidly and impartially enforced, and money payments most correctly made, but this is not all that is required. There abide other wants within the human heart. There is much said at the present time about the working classes, and a variety of means proposed for their benefit; a great deal however remains to be done. For we must not forget, that it is amongst them is found our highest death-rate; and that it is amongst them epidemics rage most fatally. The case is hard when a man, even when in full work, can barely supply the necessities of himself and family; but how much harder still, when seeking anxiously for leave to toil, that he may eat the bread of diligence, he can find none, but must stand with folded arms, his heart filled with blind wrath. "A man willing to work," writes Carlyle, "and unable to find work, is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune's inequality exhibits under the sun." Beneath the fair aspect of our prosperity, there ever welters a dark sea of hunger, discontent, and turbulence; and I need not say how such evils impair tho health of a people. 16th June, 1868.
