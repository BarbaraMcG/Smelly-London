KEN 85 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1858 - MARCH, 1859 ) 29 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY of the PARISH OF KENSINGTON. Gentlemen, I Beg to hand you my third annual Report of the mortality which has taken place during the twelve months ending January 1st, 1859, with a summary of the notices served and nuisances abated up to March 25th, 1859. During the year 1858, the mortality was high throughout the metropolis generally, and Kensington, as well as the principal towns in England, did not prove an exception to the rule. The excess of mortality was owing to diseases of a chronic character, to whooping cough, and to the prevalence of scarlatina and a new disease termed "Diphtherite" or "Diphtheria." This appears to be a disease hitherto almost unknown in London, and the majority of the deaths registered in our parish, I believe from inquiries I have made, have been due to scarlet fever complicated with severe throat affections. In the other cases, the disease appears to have been owing to the presence of noxious malaria, which have surrounded the dwellings of both rich and poor—the principal exhalations being from untrapped drains, or from the ventilating shafts of the sewers. The total number of deaths from all causes during the past year was 1,290. From this, however, we must subtract 78 deaths, which occurred in the Consumption Hospital, who were non-parishioners availing them- 30 selves of the benefits of the charity, and 12 deaths in the Cancer Hospital under similar circumstance. 10 parishioners, however, died in the Consumption Hospital, and 2 in the Cancer Hospital. By deducting, therefore, the large number of 90, the mortality of our parish will be at the rate of 21.4 per thousand per annum: it therefore follows that 240 persons died in excess of what has been termed a moderately healthy ratio, which the Registrar General has fixed as 17 per thousand. Small pox has been fatal to 2 persons—in both cases vaccination had been unsuccessfully or not at all performed. In the previous year no death from small pox occurred—this tends to prove the inefficiency in the working of the Compulsory Vaccination Act, as although the births of 1464 children were registered during the year, the certificates of successful vaccination registered amounted but to 776. I believe an amended Act of Parliament urgently called for to secure to all the benefits of the most perfect and harmless remedy against this frightful disease, namely vaccination. I think if such an Act could be efficiently and thoroughly worked, this formidable scourge would be entirely banished from our country. In each street where the disease showed itself, prompt measures were taken to whitewash and otherwise thoroughly cleanse all the habitations in the locality. Several cases, occurring in the dirtiest and in crowded localities, where it was found impossible to carry out efficient sanitary legislation, were also removed by my instructions to the Small Pox Hospital, to which establishment the parish subscribes. A severe epidemic of scarlet fever and of obstinate cases of sore throat has yisited the whole metropolis and Kensington during the past year. It appears impossible under our present sanitary knowledge to point out the exact cause of the occasional severe visitation of this and other diseases of a similar class; but they, however, without doubt obey certain fixed laws and require the presence of some hitherto unknown atmospheric influence to give them their malignant epidemic character, and it is equally to be noted that their virulence is in a marked degree controlled by the absence or presence of certain exciting causes, in the shape of any contamination of the atmosphere caused by decomposing animal or vegetable matter. The outbreak of scarlet fever began to get above the ordinary ratio during the month of July, and attained its highest point by a gradual increase in the month of September. It then gradually declined till it reached its nominal ratio. Contrary to the opinion of many sanitarians, I believe this disease, like typhus fever, is materially owing to local causes which, 31 could they be abated or entirely removed, would greatly retard the approach of this disease. Diarrhæa, which in 1857 caused 83 and in 1856 62 deaths, has been during this year much diminished, the number of deaths being only 30, and nearly all these cases occurred in infants. This marked decrease I trust has been in a great measure due to the continued better supply of pure water to the parish, the average amount of organic impurity being in the water supplied by each of the two companies only about 175 grs. per gallon. I am also aware that some of the superficial wells hitherto used for potable purposes have been discontinued owing to the efforts made by the Association of Medical Officers of Health to point out the many, impurities which water obtained from such a source must, as I have proved by analysis in my former report, necessarily contain in great abundance, and although I have not thought it necessary in our suburban district to recommend the forcible shutting up of these certain sources of contaminated drinking water, as no case of cholera has occurred, I still am glad to see the Vestry enunciating a great sanitary principle by the erection of public drinking fountains, and would recommend their formation in every available spot. I believe it, however, essential that the water should be obtained cold, direct from the main, and not. supplied from a cistern. The following Table will shew the mortality from the various epidemic or zymotic diseases, arranged in each quarter of the year, and compared with the deaths from the same diseases in 1857 and 1856. Smallpox Measles Scarlet Fever Whooping Cough Diarrhæa Fever Total 1858—1stQr l 2 8 23 2 4 40 2nd ,, ... 10 8 28 3 16 65 3rd „ ... 4 21 10 23 4 62 4th „ l 8 12 3 2 14 40 Totals, 1858 2 24 49 64 30 38 207 Totals, 1857 ... 15 26 37 83 20 180 1856 13 30 20 19 62 15 159 32 From diseases of the lungs and respiratory organs, 420 deaths occurred, viz.:— In the 1st Quarter 122 2nd „ 89 3rd „ 64 . 4th „ 145 420 This shews a decrease of 22 over the year 1857, and of 27 over 1856; this is partly owing to the fact that the one wing of the Consumption Hospital has been closed for some time, and that a limited number of patients have therefore died in this Institution. The per centage of deaths from the zymotic class to those from all causes is 16.0, and from diseases of the respiratory organs the per centage is 32.5; excluding, however, the mortality from non-parishioners in the Consumption Hospital, the per centage becomes 26.5, whereas the average of all London for the past year is but 19 : as, however, I observed in my last Annual Report, this increase is most probably owing to many persons dying from this disease who have come into the parish for its known salubrity. Of deaths at different periods of life, 298 died under 1 year of age, 113 „ between 1 and 2 years of age, 46 ,, ,, 2 „ 3 ,, 38 ,, ,, 3 „ 4 ,, 50 ,, ,, 4 ,, 5 ,, 545 children, therefore, died under 5 years of age, or above 42 per cent. of the total deaths; this, although a higher ratio than last year, is still below the average of London generally, I have again this year introduced a Table, shewing the mortality which has taken place according to the various occupations of the inhabitants. The mortality among the members of the learned professions is more than doubled, and a large increase of mortality among those engaged in house building, whilst there has been a decrease amongst gentlemen, milliners, and gentlewomen. 33 One public urinal has been erected during the year, and no prosecutions have been needed on account of the sale of bad meat, &c. The slaughter-houses have been from time to time examined by the Inspector and myself. The following is a List of Nuisances reported on by me to the Committee—the necessary works being carricd out under the superintendence of the Inspector and myself:— PROCEEDINGS UNDER NUISANCE REMOVAL ACT, From March 25th, 1858, to March 25th, 1859.

The different mews, cow-houses, and courts have been repeatedly inspected, and 2,478 houses in the poorest localities, which have been very much improved by frequent inspection. G. LOVETT, Inspector. I remain, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, FRANCIS GODRICH, Medical Officer of Health.
