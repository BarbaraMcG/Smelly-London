HES 052 HESTON AND ISLEWORTH Urban District Council. Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year ending December 31st, 1897. HESTON AND ISLEWORTH URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Annual Report. OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year ending December 31st, 1897. To the Chairman and Members of the Heston and Isleworth Urban District Council. Gentlemen, In presenting to you the Annual Report for the year ending December 31st., 1897,—which includes the inspections and action taken by my predecessor up to the time of his death, in order to furnish a complete record of the years' work—I have great pleasure in directing your special attention to the very favourable state of the District as regards health during the year. Not only is the death rate the lowest annual rate recorded for your District, but the other Mortality figures all show a marked decrease ; likewise the number of cases of Infectious Disease occurring during the year shews a reduction of nearly 40% compared with the total of the previous year. It is also a matter for 2 congratulation that notwithstanding there were but 74 cases of Scarlet Fever notified, as against 199 in the preceeding year, the number of patients removed to the Isolation Hospital shows but a slight difference, the figures being 47 and 53 respectively. Death Rate. The death rate for the year, taking the estimated population to the middle of the year as 28,765, is 13 55 per 1000. In the preceeding year the rate was 14.49; and in 1895, 17 24 per 1000. These figures do not take into account 101 deaths which occurred in the Union Workhouse of persons not belonging to your District, including these deaths the mortality is 17'06 per 1000. Birth Rate. The Birth Rate for the year is 25.34 per 1000, that of the preceeding year being 27 86 per 1000. The births in the Union Workhouse are included in this rate. Total Number of Births and Deaths. The total number of deaths in the District during the year was 491; deducting however the 101 non-resident deaths before mentioned, the number was 390 as compared with 411 in 1896, and 481 in 1895. The total number of births was 729, as against 790 and 862 respectively in the two previous years. Zymotic Death Rate. There were 40 deaths from the Zymotic Diseases, equalling 3 a rate of 139 per 1000. In the previous year the rate was 2.49 per 1000. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under the age of one year was 96, giving the rate of Infant Mortality as 131.68 per 1000 births. In the year 1896 it was 150 63 per 1000 births. Infectious Disease. During the year 184 cases of Infectious Disease were notified as occurring in the District. Of these 74 were Scarlet Fever, and 40 Diphtheria. 47 of the Scarlet Fever patients were removed to the Council's Isolation Hospital, and were all discharged cured. In the preceeding year the figures were:—cases notified 292, including 199 Scarlet Fever, 58 Diphtheria. New Isolation Hospital. The buildings are fast approaching completion, and I understand will be ready for occupation in a few months. I take this opportunity of strongly impressing upon the Council the necessity for the provision of a Laboratory and equipment for the use of the Medical Officers of Health of the two combined Districts, for a bacteriological examination of cases, or suspected cases, of Diphtheria, and other Diseases. Unsound Meat. No unsound meat was found in the District during the year, but 2 boxes and 1 barrel of fish, 1 box of oysters and 14 boxes of tomatoes were destroyed by Justices' orders. 4 Water Supply. 8 samples of water from 7 wells were analysed ; the result being that 4 were found to be good, 2 polluted, and 2 of a suspicious character. The result of the action taken is that Companys' water has been connected to 6 houses, and the water in one of the wells is not now used for drinking purposes. With a view to proving the purity of the water from the mains of the Grand Junction Water Works Company, I suggested to your Sanitary Committee the advisability of taking samples therefrom in different parts of the District for analysis by an expert, and on your resolution a sample was taken from Heston, submitted for analysis, and found good. River Brent. On your attention being called to the state of the water in the Canal and River Brent, your Special Committee made an inspection and reported thereon to you. I trust the united efforts of the several Districts affected will result in the cleansing and the prevention of further pollution of the Canal and River. House Refuse. The want of a more frequent and efficient removal of house refuse, especially in the more congested parts of your District, and where houses have but small yards attached thereto, is becoming a serious matter ; and I trust you will take the same into ernest consideration. 5 "Housing of the Working Classes Act.'' 4 Representations were made to you under this Act, relating to 7 houses. The result of the action taken is that 5 houses are closed as unfit for human habitation, and the remaining 2 are being dealt with. Legal proceedings were taken in respect to 2 of the houses. It would be a great assistance towards the proper housing of the Working Classes, if the Council would select suitable sites and build some model dwellings of a moderate size ; and if the building of not more than 4 houses in a block with a passage of 10 feet wide between each block could be insisted upon. " Public Health Act, 187S. " For inspections made under this Act, see tabular statements attached. Offensive Trades. On complaint being laid of very offensive odours caused in the frying of fish, I inspected the premises complained of on 2 occasions but failed to find any nuisance. I also inspected 3 other premises in the District where a like trade is carried on, and found proper precautions were used to prevent a nuisance. Bakehouses. In consequence of the insanitary state of one of the Bakehouses in the District, action was taken, with the result that the Bakehouse was repaired, altered, and made fit for use. 6 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milk Shops. 4 Applications for registration as Purveyors of Milk were received, the places of storage were inspected and found suitable. One Cowshed was reported upon as being dirty and defectively drained. On action being taken the shed was limewhited and the drain efficiently altered. Slaughter Houses. An application for a license for premises to be used as a Slaughter House was received. This was granted for one year. Matters referred to in last Report. M ain Water Course:—The condition of this has very much improved, due mainly to the enforcing of the connection of the drainage of premises with the Sewers. Mortuary:—A Mortuary for Hounslow has been erected and will be ready for use very shortly. Back-water, North Hyde:—The backwater of the Canal at North Hyde, as mentioned in the report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1895, is still at times in an insanitary condition, owing to the Occupiers not carrying out their promise to cart away manure as it is unloaded from the barges. Roads:—The Worple, Queens Terrace, and Grove Roads have received attention and are now in a fair condition. The Magdala Road at Isleworth and the Thornbury Road on the Spring Grove Estate, have been sewered, drained, 7 paved, and channelled, but several roads on the last mentioned Estate are in an insanitary condition, and require repairs and cleansing. The active measures taken for the improvement of the drainage of the Spring Grove Estate, and the laying of the storm water Sewer in the Grove Road, should improve the health of the inhabitants of these localities. Tables. In addition to the before mentioned tabular statement the following tables are also attached to this report. 1. Deaths classified according to diseases, ages, and localities. 2. Population, Births, and new cases of Infectious Diseases. 3. Various forms giving a record of the vast amount of work carried out by the Sanitary Inspector and his Assistant, and I have pleasure in testifying to the assiduous attention and the able and efficient manner in which both these Officers have carried out their work.

An examination of the figures will shew that the time of myself and of Mr. Sexton has been fully occupied. I must again state that every endeavour is made to make house to house visits, but the work entails so much time that it cannot be dealt with satisfactorily with the present staff. The owner of the house mentioned in the last report, has at considerable expense, put the house in general repair ; yet there is still, the difficulty of dealing with the occupants. No case of Infectious Disease occurred in either of these houses. The Owners are dil gent and attentive in keeping them in. order. No case of Infectious Disease was met with on the Boats. The health of the Occupants and the general cleanliness were very good. Included in the gang were some tent dwellers in a wretched unhealthy condition. (C. 2.)

The health of the workers and the general sanitary condition of the shops has been fairly good. Due attention is given by the proprietors to air space, ventilation, and cleansing. The general state has been fairly satisfactory. One bakehouse has been repaired & ventilated. I am still of opinion that a bubiic abattoir is needed. A new mortuary for Hounslow is nearly completed.

I have reported upon this matter from time to time, calling attention to the nuisance from the quantity of refuse that is allowed to accumulate before removal, and I believe it is receiving attention. I am still of opinion that it is requisite that the bodies of all animals dying from Contagious Diseases, should be consumed by fire. This application was received and granted for the keeping of not more than 3 children. I always find the children well cared for but are generally of a weak constitution. (Signed) Jas. I.
