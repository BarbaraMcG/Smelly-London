This introduction is being written at a time when the massive re-organisation of the National Health Service is the main subject of discussion amongst those interested or involved in health matters. It is difficult, therefore, to look back to 1971 and comment at any length on the progress that took place and the changes occuring during that year However, I must draw attention to one or two events of that time. First, it was in that year that the setting up of the new Social Services Department produced such a change in the Health Department-taking away the Mental Health Service-the home helps-day nurseries-child minders etc. Considerable resources had been expended in developing these services since 1965 and particularly rapid progress had been made in building up the mental health service of the new London Borough. These services should continue to develop and expand if the Borough is to keep pace with modern developments in Health and Social Services with their emphasis on community care. I am pleased to record during 1971 continued progress in the Health Education Section of the Department-though it is sad to have to recall the death of Mr. A. C. Phillips the Projectionist/Technician who was such a helpful and popular member of the staff. The section on Page 21 of the report discusses only some of the liaison arrangements which were formed to help towards the co-ordination of services which is so necessary if the present tripartite system of the Health Service is to function for the patient's benefit. The 'new look' Community Nursing Service (as outlined in the Mayston Report) began to take shape and the proposed appointment of a Director of Nursing Services was put forward. The Health Visitor recruitment was still difficult and suggestions are put forward of ways in which it may be helped. The Department continued to be a busy one and the emphasis on the handicapped child in clinics-schools - and assessment centre continued. The Public Health Inspectorate as always had a busy year in 1971. The operating of the Noise Abatement Act of 1960 brought a slight increase in the number of visits. Unfortunately it was decided that the extension of the Smoke Control Areas should again be deferred although the major portion of the Borough is designated for this purpose. The need for vigilance was again demonstrated by the occurrence of a number of outbreaks of salmonella infection at no less than six different wedding receptions talcing place on the same day. The common source turned out to be a butcher's premises in a neighbouring borough, where the storage of cooked and uncooked turkeys together demonstrated how easy it is for cross infection to take place. Imported foods too demand an increased amount of time and staff and are likely to continue to require more and more attention as the years go by and as the amount of trade passing through the transport depots increases.

There is no apparent reason for the reduction in the estimate and this figure must be suspect. On it are based the local statistical rates for births and deaths which may therefore be artificially high. In order to improve comparability with national statistics, the Abbreviated List of Causes of Death issued by the Registrar General was expanded in 1971 to include further sub-divisions relating to deaths from tuberculosis, malignant neoplasms and multiple sclerosis, and now comprises classifications under 72 headings. 14 CAUSES OF INFANT DEATHS Cause of Death Age at Death Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks - 1 year Enteritis and other diarrhoeal diseases - 1 1 Meningitis 1 1 2 Pneumonia 1 2 3 Other diseases of respiratory system 1 7 8 Congenital Anomalies 10 3 13 Birth Injury, Difficult labour etc. 9 - 9 Other causes of perinatal mortality 10 - 10 32 14 46 PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF DEATH (All Ages) Diseases of heart and circulatory system 644 Cancer and other malignant diseases 482 Pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases 268 Cerebrovasculor disease and other diseases of the brain and nervous system. 245 I give below for purpose of comparison the birth and death rates of Barking, Greater London and England and Wales for 1971.

At Committee level there is cross-representation of members and officers. For example the Chairman of the Health Committee serves on the Regional Hospital Board. The Vice Chairman among others serves on the Executive Council and the Medical Officer of Health and members of the Health Committee serve on Hospital Management Committees. Hospital Management Committee members from two Management Committees are co-opted on to the Health Committee. The Medical Officer of Health attends the meetings of the Local Medical Committee and a family doctor is co-opted on to the Health Committee. At officer level there are links through the Medical Officer of Health with the Hospital Medical Advisory and Staff Committees and the Medical Officer of Health serves on the area Committee of the Association of Hospital Management Committees. One Consultant from the hospital for mentally subnormal, visits the Borough and sees subnormals at the request of the Health Department. One specialist visitor (Geriatric Liaison Officer) on the staff of the Medical Officer of Health is responsible for acting as liaison between the geriatric units-the family doctors and the Local Authority services. Health Visitors work in a health centre where a group of family doctors attend and carry on Infant Welfare Clinics there. The services of Health Visitors, District Nurses and Midwives are placed at the disposal of the family doctors as requested, the contact being made either through the Senior Nursing Staff or directly with the nursing staff concerned. Meetings between Local Health Authority Medical Officers of Health and family doctors who carry out clinics in the area are held at which common problems and new projects are discussed. 21 HEALTH EDUCATION As far as the Health Education Section was concerned, 1971 was a year of great turbulence, starting in January with the total wreckage of Gale Street Health Education Centre by vandalism, followed by the sudden and untimely death in February of Mr. A.C. Phillips, Projectionist/ Technician. In March, a new but much smaller Centre was found at Faircross Old School, and in June, we welcomed to the team Mr. P. Moss to succeed Mr. Phillips. Finally, Mrs. P. Kasim, Assistant Health Education Officer resigned at the end of December. In spite of all these changes, it was pleasing to note that the demand for health education in the Borough increased. This demand was met, but unfortunately, as financial restrictions once again prevented the post of the second assistant being filled, expansion of the service, research and evaluation of health needs within the Borough, and many other health projects, were curtailed. Health Education in Schools. The most noticeable change in health education in schools is the increased demand for "specialised" health topics. At the moment eight of the eleven comprehensive schools have received short series of talks by staff of the Health Education Section and Health Department in general. The General Studies Department of Rush Green College again asked for help with their health education programmes to both day and block release students, and a total of sixty four lectures were given throughout the year. We were invited to participate in a “Family Evening-Sex Education" experiment for the first year pupils and their parents at one of the Comprehensive Schools. The response of the parents, pupils and teaching staff was overwhelming and the evening a success. The Child Care Course for the basic certificate of the National Association for Maternal and Child Welfare again proved popular, and all oral examinations were covered by staff from the Health Department. Food Hygiene Education The Food Hygiene Certificate and Diploma Courses of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene run in conjunction with Rush Green College, have once again proved worthwhile, the lectures being given by the Public Health Inspectorate and other members of the Health Department. Teachers Training Course The Health Education Officer was invited to give a two-hour lecture on the Use of Visual Aids in Health teaching to the Teachers Training Course at the North East London Polytechnic. This was very well attended by not only student teachers but by all the Health Visitor students also. 22 Films The demand for films for use in schools, colleges, clinics, clubs, Y.M.C.A. and other organisations has doubled, a grand total of 441 showings of films being lent by the Section during the year. Several films have had to be replaced, and it is envisaged that this demand will prove to be just as great during 1972. Home Safety Continued support was given to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, and a representative was present at the National Home Safety Conference held at Scarborough. Many youth organisations teach home safety as part of the Service Section of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, and twelve separate oral examinations were held in the Borough with staff from the Health Education Section acting as examiners. Displays and Exhibitions A wheeze, a cough and a specimen of Cancerous Lung drew a large crowd to the Health Department's exhibition on Anti-Smoking at the Town Show this year. It also drew the attention of the public to the proposed Anti-Smoking Clinics that were being set up in the Borough. The staffs of both Barking and Rush Green Hospitals invited the Department to provide displays in the foyers of both Maternity Wings, and a large exhibition on Home Safety was erected in the foyer of Rush Green Maternity Wing on their Hospital Open Day. My most grateful thanks to all the hospital staffs involved for their continued co-operation. Visitors Mrs. Sangma, Matron of a hospital in Assam, Mrs. Mcintosh, Midwifery Tutor Diploma Student, three overseas Public Health Students from London University. One Social Worker Student from North East London Polytechnic, and Twenty-six Community Care Students from Barking and Rush Green Hospitals, visited the Section for varying lengths of time to both see and hear, how health education is carried out in the Borough. Campaigns Phase 'B' of the major Cytology Campaign was commenced in the New Year and suitable visual material was supplied to all factories who requested same. A campaign programme of immunisation against Rubella for all secondary schoolgirls was continued throughout the year and a total of 27 separate talks to explain the dangers of Rubella during pregnancy were given by a Health Education Officer, to first and second year girls, at the request of headteachers. 23 Talks to Outside Organisations Talks to diverse groups on a wide variety of health topics were given throughout the Borough. Speakers were provided for various women's organisations, Royal College of Midwives (Havering and Barking Branch), Guides, Brownies, Rangers and other youth groups. Health Education topics were also introduced into two groups at the Y.M.C.A., namely, the "SYMCA" group (girls 12-15 years old) and the "PROBE" group (mixed 17 - JO year olds). My most grateful thanks to the staff of the Y.M.C.A. for all their co-operation, suggestions and help. 24 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN During the year 408 mothers attended our clinics for ante-natal care from the midwives. A total of 535 clinic sessions were held and in addition 1,588 attendances were made at Mothercraft and Relaxation Classes. Centres offering ante-natal care are as follows Centre Annie Prendergast Clinic Ashton Gardens, Chadwell Heath. The Clinic, Becontree Avenue, Dagenham. Central Clinic, Vicarage Drive, Barking. The Clinic, Ford Road, Dagenham. Marks Gate Clinic, Lawn Farm Grove, Marks Gate. The Clinic, Oxlow Lane, Dagenham. Julia Engwell Clinic, Woodward Road, Dagenham.

This Order discontinued the issue of cheap welfare milk to expectant mothers and young children and extended the provision of free milk and welfare foods in large and in low income families. Also in 1971, cod liver oil and orange juice were phased-out during the year, being replaced by vitamin A, D and C drops for children and reconstituted A, D and C tablets for mothers. Welfare foods and nutrients are sold at Child Health Centres during infant welfare sessions and also at Central Clinic on Wednesday afternoons. During the year, the following amounts of welfare foods were issued: National Dried Milk 4,328 packets Cod Liver Oil 1,290 bottles Vitamin A and D tablets 1,778 packets of 20 Orange Juice 35,745 bottles Vitamin Drops 2,972 bottles 26 PLAY THERAPY Play therapy groups continued during the year at Julia Engwell, Oxlow Lane and Thames View Clinics, and at Northbury Infants School. A total of 78 children attended the groups and benefited from playing and forming relationships with each other under the guidance of the play therapy staff. Attendance at the individual groups was as follows At Julia Bigwell we had 18 children, 4 who came from difficult homes and 2 who were mentally backward. At Thames View we have helped 20 children 4 who had behaviour problems and 3 with bad speech defects. At Oxlow Lane 19 children have attended. Quite a large percentage of these children come from the high rise flats which do create behaviour problems. Northbury group had 21 children in the past year, 4 came from difficult homes, 1 was very mentally retarded he was later transferred to a special school and 2 had speech defects. We also had 3 immigrant children here. Unfortunately owing to the shortage of classrooms at the school we had to close Northbury at the end of the year. KINGSLEY HALL DAY ASSESSMENT CENTRE The work of this centre, which was described in detail in my Report for 1970 was continued during the year. 24 children were admitted during 1971, many having multiple handicaps. Two children, both severely handicapped, suffered defects which could be attributed to exposure ante-natally to the rubella virus. One child of 3½ years with agenesis of the 9th and 10th cranial nerves, who had spent most of her life in hospital was able to be discharged home. By her attending Kingsley Hall the parents were supported and given confidence to assume responsibility for her management. The close association the centre enjoys with the Institute of Child Health and the Woolf son Centre was maintained during the year. Staff accompanied children on visits to this and other hospitals for review etc., and children were assisted on 60 occasions in this way. The average attendance at Kingsley Hall over the year was 13 children per day. 27 COMMUNITY NURSING SERVICE 1971 saw the beginning of a new era for the Community Nursing Service. The Mayston Management Structure was approved and accepted by the Council. The first appointments were made in October 1971 when Miss M. Dobson, NonMedical Supervisor of Midwives and Superintendent of Home Nurses and Mrs. C. Ledden, Deputy Superintendent Health Visitor were appointed as the two Area Nursing Officers. It is hoped to appoint the Director of Nursing Services early in the New Year. The "Social Service" Department officially came into being on the 1st April but did not assume the responsibility of the Day Care of Children until the 1st July. Therefore the health visiting section continued to accept the responsibility of registration and supervision of Daily Minders and Playgroups until that time. A full complement of District Midwives and District Nurses was maintained. Recruitment to these services does not normally present problems as the majority of the staff are recruited locally. A high standard of nursing care again is evident. Health Visiting recruitment presents a different picture. There is a general national shortage of health visitors. Barking falls far below the national average of health visitors employed, regrettably one of the lowest figures in the country. This is an unhappy situation. It is generally accepted that housing accommodation, car loan purchase schemes with a low rate of interest and general practitioner attachment are aids in recruitment, which at the moment Barking cannot offer. As and when the Mayston structure is fully implemented, roles are clearly defined, first line managers are in post to give support to field staff and to feed back information to top management, then I have confidence that with the other "aids" mentioned recruitment will improve. Health Visitor Students The Borough is again sponsoring two student health visitors and this is a further aid to recruitment. During the past year Post Graduate courses, courses in management and refresher courses have been made available to appropriate staff. Resignations during the year include Miss C. Oldham, Chief Nursing Officer and Mrs. C. Ledden Area Nursing Officer. All the nursing staff should be commended for their work during the past year with special reference to the health visitors who have shouldered a high case load and responsibility.

A Medical Officer continued to attend at the Adult Training Centre for one session per week for Medical Inspection of Trainees. The Council's Day Nurseries were also regularly attended by Medical Officers who monitor development and advise on the health of the children. VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox In November 1971 authorities were advised that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security had accepted the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that vaccination against smallpox need not now be recommended as a routine procedure in early childhood and immunisation programmes were amended accordingly. During the year 1080 persons received primary vaccination and 743 were revaccinated against the disease. 29 The following statistics relate to persons protected at council clinics or by general practitioners during 1971:- TETANUS IMMUNISATION Year of birth Primary Immunisation Children who received a booster dose 1971 38 - 1970 1,307 61 1969 479 89 1968 57 77 1964-67 164 1,957 Others under age 16 439 1,021 Total all ages 2,484 3,205 POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATION Year of birth Primary Immunisation Children who received a booster dose 1971 46 _ 1970 1,270 54 1969 551 87 1968 53 79 1964-67 158 1,872 Others under age 16 56 865 Total all ages 2,134 2,957 WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION Year of birth Primary Immunisation Children who received a booster dose 1971 38 - 1970 1,303 61 1969 477 84 1968 46 56 1964-67 33 316 Others under age 16 2 78 Total all ages 1,899 595 30 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION Year of birth Primary Immunisation Children who received a booster dose 1971 38 - 1970 1,306 61 1969 479 88 1968 53 72 1964-67 147 1,910 Others under age 16 25 396 Total all ages 2,048 2,527 MEASLES During the year a total of 1,657 children were vaccinated against measles and further details are given in the following table. The effect on the incidence of measles continues to be satisfactory.

C. G. VACCINATION B.C.G. Vaccination is a safe and very effective method of protecting the individual against tuberculosis. Extensive trials in England and Wales have shown that it provides 80% protection against subsequent tuberculous infection. The protection is long lasting and remains substantial for 10 or more years after vaccination. During 1971, 1,365 children were given B.C.G. vaccine, a decrease of 299 over 1970. 80 pupils had a grade 2 or more reaction to Heaf testing and were referred to the Consultant Chest Physician for further investigation. It is now our policy to vaccinate children showing Grade 1 response to Heaf testing as it is more than probable that their response to the Heaf test is due to mycobacteria other than tuberculosis. In addition 270 contacts of tuberculosis were vaccinated by the Chest Physician. FAMILY PLANNING SERVICE From 1st April, 1971 the Council agreed to expand its family planning service by accepting financial responsibility for the cost of consultation in all cases resident in the Borough attending Family Planning Association Clinics. Before this date the cost of consultation was only accepted in respect of persons in medical or social need of family planning. Persons not in need continue to pay for their family planning supplies. Also in 1971 the Department of Health and Social Security issued guidance to hospital authorities on the development of family planning services in hospitals. A family planning clinic for hospital referred patients was commenced at Barking Hospital on 10th June, 1971. The following sessions are now held in the Borough:- Annie Prendergast Clinic Barking Hospital Central Clinic Five Elms Clinic Five Elms Road, Dagenham. Wednesday 6.30-8.00 p.m. 1st and 3rd Thursday in the month-afternoon. Monday 7.00-8.30 p.m. Tuesday 7.00-8.30 p.m. 32 Ford Road Clinic - Monday 7.00 - 8.30 p.m. Thames View Clinic - 2nd & 4th Thursday in the month 7.00-8.30 p.m. In addition the domiciliary family planning service continued, for those special cases where more intensive care is required. 33 PREVENTION OF ILLNESS, CARE AND AFTER-CARE REPORT OF THE CERIATRIC LIAISON OFFICER A greater understanding of Local Authority services for the elderly has I feel been of great help to the General Practitioners and hospital staff, thus enabling a continued and co-ordinated service on patients leaving hospital. Home assessment visits continued to advise on the care of the elderly and the follow-up observation of patients discharged from hospital, these forming a major part of my work. Cases visited 1971 No. of Cases Referred by Geriatric Consultants on discharge from hospital 167 Referred by General Practitioners 13 Referred by Consultant Physicians on discharge from hospital 122 Miscellaneous Referrals 231 Revisits to cases 655 Total visits made 1,188 GERIATRIC CLINIC-PORTERS AVENUE We started the Geriatric Clinic in 1968. We actually work it on lines which seem to be a cross between a club and a "Well Woman/Man" Clinic. The people come voluntarily and they have an 8 week course attending once a week. Each week there is a lecture often accompanied by a film or coloured slides dealing with problems which would be of interest to them. e.g. Food and Health, Home and Safety, Heating and Health, Pensions and Supplementary Benefits, Care of the feet, Exercises for the over 60's and Making the most of Retirement. They also have a medical check-up if they wish. In 1971 we had 52 attenders of whom 37 asked for medical examination. One patient actually went into hospital before her medical was due. 10 men and 26 women were examined. 16 were married and living with their partners.6 were widows or single, living with relations and 14 were living alone, being widows, widowers, separated or single. 11 of the patients were found to be between 20 and 5055 overweight 7 were under 20% overweight, 8 were found to be underweight. 9 patients were found to be severely deaf, 5 of whom had been provided with hearing aids, though in one case the patient was not using the aid and in another it was broken and useless. 34 All the patients seen required glasses. 7 of them needed them for reading only but some failed to wear them. This brief report indicates that there is a need for a clinic of this kind where the patient can discuss with the doctor and nurse any problems they have without feeling that they are being hurried and it indicates a need for further clinics to be established. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF The medical invigilation of new entrants to the Council's service, and the review of cases absent from duty owing to illness continued during the year. Generally the physical condition of candidates for appointment is satisfactory. During the year 743 health questionnaires were submitted for scrutiny. 411 candidates were approved without further enquiry and 14 were accepted after satisfactory reports had been received from general practitioners or hospital consultants. The following examinations were carried out:- No. of persons medically examined 506 No. of persons found to be unfit 23 No. of persons accepted conditionally 38 No. of persons examined in connection with sickness payments 49 No. of persons examined for other authorities 3 No. of persons examined by other authorities 9 No. of Chest x-rays arranged in connection with medical examinations 312 In addition 62 students were medically examined in connection with entry to teacher training colleges, and a further 90 who had completed their course of training at the North-East London Polytechnic were re-examined prior to entry to the teaching profession. ADAPTATIONS OF HOMES TO INSTALL ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY MACHINES Patients suffering from chronic renal failure who are suitable for treatment at home may have their homes adapted by the local health authority to enable the necessary equipment to be installed and operated in hygienic conditions. During the year two homes were adapted-a private house and a Barking Council house. In the latter case there were many difficulties which were successfully overcome in establishing this patient at home. Five patients were having treatment in their own homes at the end of the year. 35 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 - Section 47 It unfortunately became necessary to remove two elderly persons to institutional care during the year. Both cases were in need of care and attention and were unwilling to leave their homes. Case A aged 69 years, was suffering from gross self neglect and malnutrition and was admitted to St. Georges Hospital, Hornchurch where he died a month later. Case B aged 83 years, had been deteriorating slowly for a number of years, and although ambulant, was living in insanitary conditions and it finally became necessary to seek an Order for removal. The patient was admitted to an Old People's Home where she settled down quite happily. ANTI-SMOKING CLINIC The danger to health from smoking was the theme of a health education exhibit at the Dagenham Town Show in July 1971. and as a result of the public interest shown, a pilot anti-smoking clinic was held at Julia Engwell Clinic. Two courses under the direction of a Senior Medical Officer were arranged. Each consisted of five evening sessions at which films were shown and lectures given. Group therapy techniques were used to reinforce the desire to give up smoking. The courses were followed by re-union meetings six months later to evaluate the success of the course. A total of 14 persons commenced attending the first course and 30 the second. After six months five members of the first course and six of the second were still not smoking. The consensus of opinion of those who attended was that the course had helped them considerably but that a more intensive programme was necessary to sustain the will of the majority of persons not to smoke during the first few weeks of withdrawal from nicotine. The limitation of the Department's resources available for this purpose, however, did not permit a more ambitious programme. CYTOLOGY SERVICE 1971 The total number of patients seen in 1971 was 1,440 which is 500 less than last year. It is a salutary reminder how important continuous publicity is in preventive work. The comparison of the year 1970 with 1971 also emphasises how much more effective is the personal touch in publicity. The informative letters enclosed in the pay slips 36 of the women employees of the Borough in the previous year, had just this magic touch. Perhaps it was the lack of this which caused the failure of our recalls, since 6 or 7 out of 10 failed to turn up. Of course, quite a number of previous patients have come up on their own initiative before receiving the official notice. However, we should not forget the possibility of the passive resistance of quite a number of people who deliberately reject the advice given. Out of the 1,440 patients examined, we found one with frank carcinoma and two had suspect smears. One 41 year old patient who showed a frank carcinoma of the cervix on speculum examination, was referred to the Gynaecologist immediately without taking a smear. She had been bleeding previously for three weeks, but did not go to her family doctor. She was seen by a Gynaecologist the following day and was admitted for operation and referred subsequently for radiology treatment at the London Hospital where she has been followed up. One 57 year old woman had a smear which was highly suggestive of carcinoma and a cone biopsy was recommended by the pathologist. She had, further to the biopsy, radiotherapy and is still under the care of Oldchurch Hospital. The third patient was 27 years old, she had a Papanicolaou Grade 11+ smear on three occasions. She was referred to the Gynaecologist and was advised to have a cone biopsy. Other findings were:- Minor Gynaecological Abnormalities (polypus and erosion etc.) 36 Fibroids 4 Cyetocele 1 Trichomonas Vaginalis 24 Monilia 9 LOAN OF SICK-ROOM EQUIPMENT Patients being nursed at home may, on medical recommendation be loaned a wide variety of equipment to assist in their care. Bulky items are delivered to patients' homes, smaller articles are collected from the health department by relatives. 2,104 articles were loaned during the year and 3,837 items were out on loan at the year's end. In addition, non returnable items for incontinent patients were supplied in considerable quantity. 43,200 disposable incontinence pads were issued and 79 patients were supplied with waterproof pants or knickers with disposable linings. Ripple beds were also loaned through hiring arrangements with manufacturers; this being the most economical way of obtaining these items in view of their high cost and maintenance charges. 37 REHOUSING ON MEDICAL GROUNDS As in previous years my Department has continued to act as adviser to the Housing Department where applicants have put forward medical grounds in their claims for rehousing. As almost half the cases require a visit from at least one and sometimes two or more members of staff as well as enquiries to hospital or family doctor it will be seen from the statistics given below that this often difficult task continues to require a considerable amount of time from the staff of the Health Department. Statistics Total number of applications 457 Number recommended for rehousing 129 VENEREAL DISEASE Contact Tracing This Borough being conveniently situated for travel to Central London, has patients attending special clinics at most of the major London Hospitals as well as the local centre at Oldchurch Hospital. Mrs. C. Ledden, Area Nursing Officer, is the designated person that special clinics can approach regarding contact tracing in the Borough but requests for assistance are rare. It is understood that in most instances the staff employed by the Hospital Service can cope with the work involved without additional assistance from this authority. Health Education The risk to health of sexually transmitted disease is included as a subject by the Health Education Section in their general health education syllabus for schools, and in talks to adult groups that request it. TUBERCULOSIS I am indebted to Dr. F. Macken, Consultant Chest Riysician, for the following report An Odelca unit x-ray session was started at Five Elms Road in the winter of 1968 and still continues to flourish. General Practitioners may refer patients for x-ray only. Appreciation is due to our Radiographer, her darkroom assistant and our clerical staff for handling this increase in number of x-rays dealt with through these years. In the past twelve months 1398 patients have been referred by general practitioners of whom 98 were recalled for large films or examination. 38 The total attendances at Clinic sessions at Five Elms for the past year have been 6395 with 1944 new patients. The total attendances at Barking Hospital Chest Unit for the same period have been 3907 with 1024 new patients. The total number of tuberculous cases on our register is at present 428. The total number of bronchial carcinoma cases found by us during the year was 119 (this figure is not a complete figure for the Borough as it lacks statistics from the Medical Division of cases not seen by us; and also cases diagnosed at other hospitals of whom we are not informed). Some work has been done through the year on pulmonary industrial hazards in factories. Our problems remain bronchitis, asthma, carcinoma of lung and tuberculosis. Our clinic nurses remain invaluable in visiting and in supervising out-patient treatment therapy, contact follow ups, and in the finding of tuberculin negative immigrants for B.C.G. vaccination. The Local Authority Health Visitors continue to help in primary visits to the homes of newly notified cases and to the homes of carcinoma sufferers to discover if Cancer Relief is necessary, or additional home help or nursing.

There does, however, exist a very serious need for more Chiropodists to cope with the heavy demands made upon this service. During the past year some staff changes have taken place, including the retirement of Mr. H. Leavesley, Chief Chiropodist, in April, and the appointment of Mr. G. E. Fenn as Chief Chiropodist, in August. In October Mr. P. Samuels was engaged as part-time Chiropodist for domiciliary visiting. Clinics: Treatment is provided for priority patients only, at the following clinics Central Clinic, Thames View Clinic Greatfields Clinic Julia Engwell Clinic Porters Avenue Clinic Ford Road Clinic Annie Prendergast Clinic Oxlow Lane Clinic Old Peoples' Homes: Five Old Peoples' Homes are regularly visited by a Chiropodist, each month, as also is Louise Graham House for mentally handicapped persons. Hospital Car Service: This is operated from the Annie Prendergast Clinic, to provide transport for physically handicapped patients, who, although unable to reach a clinic in the normal way, are not sufficiently immobile to require treatment at their own home. Domiciliary Chiropody Service: Demand for this service continues to be heavy and is provided for patients who by reason of infirmity or age are unable to attend a clinic. Approximately 50 patients per week are treated in their own homes. General Remarks: Unfortunately, owing to the need for more Chiropodial Staff, there is a lack of opportunity to develop the service to its full potential. At all clinics there is a waiting period of 10-12 weeks between appointments and between 14-16 weeks for domiciliary treatments. With case loads of this size any specialised work e.g. foot health education, appliance work inspection and treatment of school children or intensive care is almost an impossibility. However, in spite of difficulties some progress can be reported and a number of patients have benefited considerably from the making and fitting of permanent appliances for the feet. 40 Meetings of the Chiropodial Staff have been organised and discussions on drugs, dressings, appliances and day-to-day problems have taken place. There is a need for more modern equipment in the surgeries, and a new approach to the work of the Chiropodist, if new entrants are to be encouraged.

This Act brought within the educational system those children who hitherto would have been ascertained as being unsuitable for education at school, and removed from local health authorities the power to provide day care and training for them. The newly built Castle School and Training Centre, including the Special Care Unit for the severely handicapped together with its staff was transferred to the Local Education Authority, and was designated a Special School. The School Health Service continued to be responsible for the health and welfare of the children attending the Castle Special School and in common with the other special schools in the Borough, a school medical officer attends there weekly. There are 63 primary schools 12 comprehensive secondary schools and 3 special schools in the Borough. The Bentry and Castle Special Schools cater for educationally sub-normal pupils and the Faircross Special School for delicate and physically handicapped pupils. A unit for partially hearing pupils is established at Eastbury Infants' school. At the end of the year, numbers on roll were as follows Primary Schools 16,935 Secondary Schools 11,410 Special Schools 370 28.715 PROVISION OF FREE SCHOOL MILK. As from 1st September 1971 Regulations made under the Education (Milk) Act, 1971, required local education authorities to provide free school milk only to certain categories of pupils in their schoolsviz:- (a) Pupils in Special Schools. (b) Pupils in other schools up to the end of the summer term next after their seventh birthday. (c) Pupils up to the age of 12 years who are certified by the school medical officer to require free school milk by reason of their health. By the end of the year three children had been nominated to receive free school milk and the necessary arrangements were being made. CONVALESCENT TREATMENT Pupils who are recommended convalescent treatment on medical advice are sent away for periods of up to four weeks. 16 cases were recommended treatment during the year. 42 SCHOOL CONSULTATIVE CLINICS Minor ailments sessions at which a doctor was present were held at the following clinics:- Annie Prendergast Friday a.m. Becontree Avenue Monday and Thursday a.m. Central Monday, Tuesday and Thursday 9-9-30 a.m. Five Elms Monday p.m., Ft-iday a.m. Ford Road Monday a.m., Friday a.m. Julia Engwell Monday to Friday 9-9.30 a.m. Leys Monday p.m. Marks Gate Friday a.m. Oxlow Lane Wednesday a.m. Porters Avenue Monday, Wednesday and Friday 9-9*30 a.m. A total of 1,292 pupils were seen during the year. SCHOOL MEDICAL INSPECTIONS Routine school medical inspections are carried out on:- (a) pupils entering primary school, (b) pupils in their last year at primary school, and (c) where considered necessary on pupils in their last year at secondary school. In addition, pupils entering the Borough from other areas and children found to require observation or treatment are followed up as necessary. Particular attention is paid to pupils at the special schools.

The treatment of the Borough's pre-school, and school-children with speech and language disorders continues successfully, and the very fact that there are no changes may be a measure of the therapeutic value of treatment, as carried out in this Borough. Stability, and a permanence of relationship is an essential factor to successful therapy, where trust has been built up over a long period of time. Miss Symes has been in this Borough since 1951 and Miss Delaforce since 1965. Nevertheless, we would urge that a real endeavour should be made to appoint at least one more speech therapist as soon as possible as the need for maintaining the high standards of speech therapy in Barking is vital.

Fahmy, Consultant Psychiatrist for the following report During 1971 the Clinic's work maintained all the basic features outlined in the 1970 report. Despite efforts and funds that were made available, it had not been possible to increase the staff of the psychiatric service in the clinic. However, by the end of the year a Psychiatric Social Worker was appointed and will be expected to take an active role in the next year. The attached tables covering the four quarters of the year show the current call on the service and give some indication of the response to the call under the prevailing circumstances. The average waiting time of new referrals has gone down to 10 weeks and this made it possible to see some cases at regular intervals: an improvement which remains far short of coping with the real need. Analysis of the figures also reveals that the reduction in the number of new referrals was all due to the smaller number of adolescents referred by Schools, Educational Psychologists and Courts. This was partially a reflection of the change in legal procedures following the implementation of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1969 and partially due to the change to Comprehensive Education - a change that seemed to reduce (temporarily) the ability of the teachers to djserve and report disturbances. However, as noted in previous reports, adolescents cannot be materially helped under the present system of referrals. They can benefit and be better helped if a "Walk in Service" is established - one of the projects that await funds and personnel. The other projects mentioned in previous reports re work with institutions, nurseries, play groups and running groups of parents had to be postponed until more workers are appointed and until the Social Services settle after the new re-organisation. In this period of change, the effectiveness of the social workers in helping children in distress and their families has been markedly reduced. In December 1971 a psychiatric social worker was appointed and it is hoped that her work in the clinic will create more time for individual therapy for the children and offer their families more support than they have ever received from this clinic in the past. It is gratifying to note that the co-operation of educational psychologists, remedial teachers and secretaries has never faltered despite changes in personnel. The smoothness of the work and the ability of the clinic to cope with appointments, follow-ups, records etc., has been as in the past, largely due to the willing, conscientious hard work of the senior secretary. 47 CHILD GUIDANCE SERVICE Statistics 1971 Quarter Ended (a) Cases on the books at end of quarter 31.3.71 30.6.71 30.9.71 31.12.71 (i) Waiting first appointment 45 53 45 50 (ii) Seen at regular intervals 42 28 30 32 (iii) Others seen for re-assessment or surveillance 94 103 93 88 Total 181 184 168 170 (iv) Cases included in (iii) but will not be seen again unless requested 18 10 20 10 (b) Cases referred during quarter B.

FAIRCROSS SCHOOL The school year began with 103 children on roll, 55 physically handicapped, and 48 delicate. Once again I report a successful year after recovering from the effects of the bus drivers' industrial action and of the several break-ins which led to the loss of valuable equipment and teaching time. The results in the Certificate of Secondary Education Examinations were very gratifying indeed. Entries for the Royal Society of Arts, Pitman and Incorporated Phonographic Society's examinations in Commercial Subjects, yielded excellent results also. Four candidates were successful in the Royal Associated Board Music Examinations. 48 Christmas School Activities included a visit to Barking Odeon, Inter-School concerts between Faircross, Eastbury Comprehensive and Gurney School, Newham. The Annual Dinner for senior citizens was prepared, provided and presented by the Homecrafts Department. Mr. R. D. Norman, Deputy Head, was seconded as Acting Headmaster of Castle School, pending the appointment of a Headmaster for that school. In his place Mr. C. Early became responsible for music and our entry to the Barking Schools Music Festival earned us high praise from the visiting adjudicator. Visits have embraced the Science Museum, and Lullingstone Roman Villa, Eynsford, Kent. Our first swimming Gala was held on the 23rd July, bringing the school year to a successful close. I am also grateful to the Senior Physiotherapist, Mrs. A. D. Walker for the following report on her work at the school during the year:- "1971 has been an extremely busy and interesting year. We had 46 children listed for regular treatment grouped as follows: (a) 11 Spina Bifida 4 boys and 7 girls 11 Hydrocephalus, 2 have two long calipers 6 have long calipers with pelvic band. 1 walks with Canadian crutches. 6 walk with dumpers. 1 walks without sticks. 3 walk without calipers or sticks. (b) 14 Cerebral Palsy 13 boys and 1 girl 10 walk without any aids 3 walk in walking frames 1 does not walk at all 5 boys and 5 girls (c) 10 Asthma 2 frequent severe asthma attacks 8 moderately to mild asthma (d) 5 Muscular Dystrophy 4 boys and 1 girl All are wheelchair bound (e) 3 Cystic Fibrosis 1 boy and 2 girls (f) 1 Congenital Hip 1 girl (g) Rheumatoid Arthritis 1 boy (h) Congenital Heart 1 boy The Department is adequately equipped and we have one full-time and one part-time physiotherapists and one ancillary helper. Our connection with Enfield Technical College has proved very valuable. The walking frame they designed and made for us proved to 49 be a great help to some of our cerebral palsy children, better in fact than we dared to hope in the beginning. The co-operation with the hospitals is growing steadily, and in June 1971 Great Ormond Street Hospital organised their first school clinic for children with cerebral palsy. We had four children from the school attending, our school doctor, the class teacher and one physiotherapist. It was a very interesting morning. Another clinic was held in November and we are hoping for twice yearly clinics from now on. The second half of 1971 was extremely busy as I was away on maternity leave and the remaining staff worked very hard to get through the most important treatment. My sincere thanks to them both. I also wish to express my thanks to Faircross School and the Civic Centre for the co-operation and help they gave me in 1971•" BENTRY SCHOOL I have received the following report from Dr. K. Fitzpatrick, School Medical Officer:- "The staff of Five Elms Clinic provide the medical care and supervision of the children at Bentry Special School. The schoolrurse is a frequent visitor and well acquainted with the children. A weekly session is held at the school for the purpose of interviewing parents, discussing their problems and carrying out medical examinations, ijmnunisations, etc. The school is also visited by a Speech Therapist, a Peripatetic Teacher of the Deaf and a School Psychologist. Major changes in the school have been the introduction of the admission unit and the workshop pilot scheme. Children requiring special education are being discovered at an earlier age. This is due to the development clinics, Kingsley Hall assessment centre and the use of therapeutic play groups at the Clinics. The new school building is provided with excellent accomodation for this nursery group and with the help of teachers and two nurses the children are given every opportunity to develop their full potential. 50 51 HANDICAPPED PUPILS REQUIRING EDUCATION AT SPECIAL SCHOOLS - 1971 Blind Part Sighted Deaf Part Hearing Physically Handicapped Delicate Maladjusted Educationally Sub-normal Epileptic Speech Defect Total Number of children newly assessed in the year 1 1 - 1 18 4 6 59 - - 90 Number of children placed in Special Schools in year 1 - 1 1 14 4 11 47 - - 79 Number of children requiring places in Special Schools 2 2 - 1 19 7 5 71 - - 107 Number of children included above whose parents had refused consent to their admission. - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 Number of children on Registers of Special Schools at 20th January, 1972 5 14 4 19 55 54 34 286 2 1 474 Number of children receiving tuition at home or in hospital, etc. - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 INCIDENCE OF CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES The notification and classification of congenital abnormalities apparent in children at birth continued during the year, the following defects being noted in 35 babies Central Nervous System Anencephalus 3 Other specified malformations of brain or spinal cord 1 Spina Bifida 2 Eye and Ear Accessory auricle 3 Cataract and Corneal Opacity 1 Alimentary System Cleft Lip 2 Cleft palate 5 Rectal and Anal atresia and stenosis 1 Urino-genital system Hydrocele 1 Hypospadias, epispadias 1 Indeterminate sex and true Hermaphroditism 1 Limbs Polydactyly 2 Reduction deformity hand or arm 1 Reduction deformity leg or foot 1 Talipes 9 Other parts of Musculo-skeletal System Chondrodystrophy 2 Other Systems Exomphalos, Omphalocele (excluding umbilical hernia) 1 Pigmented naevus 3 Other Malformations Down1s syndrome (Mongolism) 1 Other and unspecified congenital malformations 1 52 DENTAL SERVICES I am indebted to the Principal Dental Officer for the following reportt- SCHOOL DENTAL SERVICE The School Dental Service was able during 1971 to provide full dental treatment for any school child in the Borough receiving education from the local authority including those in special schools. The number of school roll inspected at school and at clinics was 21,525, of this number 10,890 required treatment and had treatment offered. Children in the Borough paid 12,235 visits to the various dental clinics for treatment. CONSERVATION AND ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT There were 7,419 fillings in permanent teeth and 3,650 fillings in deciduous teeth a total of 11,069. This is 709 fillings more than in 1970. The amount of orthodontic trestment carried out during the year was satisfactory; 44 new cases were commenced, six children were referred to the Dental Consultant at Whipps Cross Hospital. DENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION The experiment started in 1970 of distributing dental hygiene kits to all new school entrants was continued. The Principal School Dental Officer visited all infant schools and spoke to all head teachers in infant schools. Crest interest was shown by head teachers, many asked for dental health posters and dental literature. Others asked for talks and film shows on dental health. All this has been done, all agreed that the distribution of dental hygiene kits was an excellent idea. STAFFING The year 1971 had many problems, so far as full time staff was concerned. We started 1971 with two full time officers short, in February one new full time officer commenced duty. She stayed until July 31st when she left as the journey to her home and back each day took over two hours. Two sessional dental officers were employed in August, both proved to be very satisfactory, and requested full-time appointments. One was appointed full-time in September, and one in October. However, the officer appointed in October decided to return to Scotland in November, so we were, so to speak, "back to square one". I would at this point, like to say that in my opinion nothing has a more adverse effect on the dental treatment of children than the continual changing of dental staff. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE DENTAL SERVICES Dental treatment was available at all dental clinics for expectant and nursing mothers, and children under five years of age. In the year 1971, this service expanded considerably. Comparing inspections with 1969 and 1970 when 417 and 625 children had inspections, in 1971, 775 children were inspected. Of these 775 inspected, 507 commenced a course of dental treatment and 420 completed a course of dental treatment. 772 fillings were completed, the highest number ever in the Borough. 53 GENERAL COMMENTS The year 1971 was a successful year from a dental point of view, when one considers the numerous set-backs experienced. Staffing difficulties have already been mentioned. The re-flooring of Julia Engwell Dental Clinic required arrangements to be made during this period to do extra school inspections in order to keep the staff of this clinic fully occupied. However at one period during this time, 26 schools were closed or part closed owing to lack of heating, arising from a strike of oil delivery drivers and many inspections had to be re-allocated. During the postal strike great difficulties were experienced in getting appointments to parents. Finally I wish to thank head teachers, teachers in all schools, medical and dental staff in clinics and last, but by no means least, the School Health Section of the Health Department for their oo-operation and help, during the year 1971• 54 DENTAL SERVICE STATISTICS Sessions (½ days) worked l.

During the year six bacteriological, two chemical and six bacteriological/chemical samples were taken from the Company's mains in the borough. The water does not have plumbo-solvent properties and no action was called for in respect of any form of contamination. There is a piped supply inside all houses. During the year the total length of new mains laid was 2,669 yards, and 558 new supplies were connected in the borough. The General Manager and Engineer-in-Chief of the Essex Water Company has furnished the following report:- "Bacteriological and chemical examinations are made of the raw water, the water in its various stages of treatment, and the water going into supply. A total exceeding 10,000 chemical, bacteriological and biological examinations have been made and all water going into supply was wholesome. Analyses have also been made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in the various parts of the Company's district, including that of your Council, and all proved to be satisfactory." SE.JERAGZ AIID SSIAC-E DISPOSAL I am indebted to the Borough Engineer, Surveyor and Planning Officer who has supplied the following infornation:- "The drainage systems of the borough function adequately, although infiltration at times of high intensity storms causes difficulties in isolated instances. Improvements to the Dagenham trunk foul systems are at present under construction and progressive improvement can be expected as the work proceeds with completion of the current contract anticipated later this year. Allied with the recent completion of the Riverside Sewage Works the foul drainage system for the Eastern section of the borough will cater for present flows and will contain some spare capacity for future requirements. Drainage improvements in the Western sector of the borough are concentrated in the Barking Central Area. Work is progressing on the detailed design with implementation anticipated in 1972, giving relief to both surface water and soil systems and incorporating a new pumping station and outfall into the River Roding." 57 SWIMMING BATHS There aire three open air and one indoor public swimming pools in the borough. In addition there is a pool at the North East London Polytechnic Barking Precinct and four of the schools are provided with small pools. All swimming pools take their water from the mains of the Jiissex Hater Company. Regular samples were taken during the year and all results were satisfactory with the exception of one which was from a School Pool. The water had a high content of ammoniacal nitrogen with appreciable organic impurity, substantial residuum of chlorine present and bacteriological results were inferior for a swimming pool. The pool was temporarily closed and re-opened after thorough cleansing. HOUSING Slum Clearance The year showed a further reduction in the action taken to clear unfit houses from the borough. The Council's comprehensive Slum Clearance Programme drawn up in 1957 is now all but exhausted and the small areas remaining present special features and difficulties which require careful consideration before representation is made. The worst slum conditions have now been swept away. During this year one small clearance area comprising two dwelling houses was represented and, in addition, representations concerning three individual unfit houses were received by the Council. A Public Local Enquiry was held during the year as a result of an objection to the Council's proposal to compulsorily purchase a terrace of 14 dwellings and shop dwellings considered to be unfit for human habitation. The objection was subsequently upheld on the grounds that the premises in question had lost its character as a dwelling house. Incrovenent and Conversion Grants During the year 55 improvement grants, 67 standard grants and one special grant were approved. Preparations for the declaration of two further General Improvement Areas were continued. Problems in providing qualified staff to carry out the surveys of properties are never completely overcome due to constant demands in other fields. It is essential that experienced officers be used for this work since they must be able to answer all questions arising from the exercise and provide accurate information concerning items eligible for grant. 58 Work in the existing General Improvement Area appears, at first sight, to be disappointingly slow but it should be remembered that much improvement was done in the area before declaration as a result of advance publicity. Difficulty is being experienced in finding builders to carry out work since demand for improvement is increasing all over the borough. Qualification Certificates - Housing Act 19b9 During the year 292 applications were received and 102 were approved. These figures indicate the generally unsatisfactory conditions found in houses that, in many cases, have obviously received no visit by the owners for years. It is significant that many applications have been refused, not only on grounds of disrepair, but also because of missing amenities. The time of professional staff which is wasted by these irresponsible applications has to be borne by the Council and no redress even in monetary terms is available. If some kind of penalty were imposed in cases where the application should never have been made, for obvious reasons, the number of refusals might be effectively reduced. Houses in Multiple Occupation 69 visits were paid to these properties during the year. As reported in previous years, there is relatively no multiple occupation problem within this district since few areas of the borough contain houses of sufficient size to provide the accommodation required. Conditions generally were found to be satisfactory and it was not necessary to institute legal proceedings in cases where contraventions were discovered. Particular attention was paid during all visits to means of escape in case of fire. Gypsy Sites and Fairgrounds 128 visits have been made by my staff during the year and problems still arise. At the beginning of the year a temporary caravan site was opened at The Chase, Dagenham Road, Dagenham, pending the construction of a permanent encampment. 59 Despite this temporary provision, caravans continued to occupy land which had recently been cleared of unfit properties and complaints were received from nearby residents. It was necessary to institute long drawn out procedures in the High Court to obtain an Order to secure the eviction of some 27 trespassers and the sites were eventually cleared and made safe. In June the Health Committee recommended to the Council that a permanent Gypsy Encampment be constructed to meet the Authority's obligations under the Caravan Sites Act, 1968. Travelling Fairs which visit the borough on several occasions during each year have again proved responsible and clean in their mode of living. Sites are often cleaner after their departure than before their arrival. LAUNDRY SERVICE This service still continues with a once weekly collection. The helpful, co-operative attitude of the department's drivers and the laundry staff at the Goodmayes Hospital in carrying out what is sometimes an unpleasant task, ensures a very satisfactory service. An average of 33 cases used the service at any one time, which shows a slight increase on last year's figures. In conjunction with this service several requests were made for the collection and destruction of soiled dressings (e.g. inco pads, paddy pads, etc.) in cases of incurable diseases. During the year an average of six collections were made. The main reason for collection is that the burning of dressings is impossible or difficult and neighbours complain of constant smoke nuisance. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT. I960 During the year the following visits were paid to premises as a result of noise, a slight increase on last year's figures- Industrial premises 72 visits Commercial premises 42 " Private premises 52 " 60 Complaints are still being received from residents regarding (i) private clubo, (ii) power machinery in private dwellings, (iii) pneumatic drills, (iv) packaging warehouses and (v) wood cutting machines. The complaints were all visited with satisfactory results. In the case of (iv) legal proceedings were taken and a nuisance order obtained; no further trouble has arisen. This type of nuisance highlights one of the problems associated with the planning classification surrounding the word 'warehouse' where often the plans submitted give no indication of the type of work which may occur within the warehouse. In respect of (v) the noise level is still considerably reduced after modifications were made but complaints persist. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION As in the past few years no progress was made in respect of smoke control areas during the year. The Council felt that the extension of smoke control areas in the borough must be deferred due to the continued financial crisis. The present position is as follows:Dagenham Order No. No. of Houses Date of Operation 1 1,000 (Marks Gate) 1st September, 1959 2 3,722 (L.C.C.

Estate) 1st July, 1966 11 1,976 1st November, 1966 In all 42,594 premises out of a total of 55»013 premises in the borough are now within smoke control areas. 61 At the end of 1970 problems arose in respect of the shortage of smokeless fuel and a relaxation of approximately 40% of Smoke Control Orders was made for a period of three months. This expired on the 31st March; no further trouble was experienced during the year. Industry still continues to play its part in the general improvement. 37 smoke observations were carried out during the year resulting in only one contravention and this was due to a mechanical failure; a warning letter was sent. The Council take part in the National Survey on Air Pollution and continue to take readings at the eight stations in the borough. The readings are transferred to the Ministry for their use. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS The total number of Hairdressing Establishments in the borough is 93. Of this number only 14 gave rise to complaint in respect of the hygiene standards of the Byelaws but these contraventions were of a minor nature and were sill remedied as a result of informal action. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 9 licences were issued during the year; the extent of the livestock in these premises is very small. During the year regular visits were paid to all premises to ensure no nuisances occurred or breaches of the licensing conditions. The premises are of a high standard and no statutory action was found to be necessary. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT. 1949 During the year 854 notifications of infestations were received of which 366 concerned rats. The remaining 488 were in connection with mice. This is an increase on the figures for the previous year. All cases were treated by the two Rodent Operatives with satisfactory results. 62 PROTECTION OF BIRDS ACT. 1954 Infestation by feral pigeons was the subject of complaint in the early part of the year and was found, on investigation, to be widespread, high rise blocks of flats being particularly affected. Several methods of control were carried out, including trapping, shooting and narcotisation. This latter method was new and was operated at first under the control of the Pest Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who, after supervising the first two incidents, granted a license to a member of the Department who has since supervised this method of control. During the year a considerable reduction in numbers has been effected, particularly at the Clarksons and The Shaftesbury flats and at Sebastian Court. However, there appears to be no short term remedy to eliminate this pest. Often infestations are encouraged by residents throwing waste food, particularly bread, to the one or two feral pigeons which begin to frequent the building and very quickly the numbers are augmented by breeding and influx of other pigeons so that in a short time a sizeable infestation exists. Efforts to persuade residents to cease feeding the birds have met with only minimal success and the policy of controlling these birds remains very controversial. BEES AND WASPS From time to time complaints were received concerning swarms of bees and wasps. The co-operation of bee keepers has been sought in the past but difficulties were being experienced in obtaining their help and, therefore, alternative arrangements had to be made. After many enquiries the services were acquired of two people who agreed to be available at all times to deal with these matters. These arrangements have proved to be very advantageous to the department. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACTS. 1964 and 1970 The one riding establishment continued to operate and the staff of the Corporation of London who administer the Act on our behalf were satisfied with the manner in which it was run. No complaints from residents were received during the year. 63 DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACT. 1950 The Corporation of London Officials deal with the routine prevention on behalf of the borough and, during the year, there were no contraventions of the Act.

In addition to verbal warnings, suggestions and advice to managements and staff during the routine visits, 120 informal notices were served upon the owners and occupiers. 196 inspections were carried out in connection with markets, stalls and delivery vehicles and 19 informal notices were served. The following sure premises which have been registered under the Food and Drugs Act 1955 for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food:- No. of Premises Type No. of Visits 46 Butchers 185 33 Fish Shops 116 29 Other Food Shops 57 Milk All milk which is distributed in the area is produced and bottled outside the borough. The number of registered distributors is 121 operating frcm 109 premises, bl visits were paid to dairies and distributors premises. Ice Cream The total number of registered premises selling ice cream is 208. Of these one is registered for the manufacture of ice cream. 173 visits were paid to these premises. During the year 27 applications for the storage and sale of ice cream were granted. 45 inspections in connection with itinerant vendors were carried out. 66 During the year 102 samples of ice cream were submitted for bacteriological examination; they were graded as follows:- Grade I Grade II Grade III Grade IV TOTAL 71 18 11 2 102 In addition to ice cream, 24 lollies were submitted for examination. All were satisfactory. Unsound Food During the year the Committee considered 56 complaints concerning unsound food purchased by residents and the following action was taken:- 26 Cases - Prosecutiore resulting in fines 16 " - Warning letters sent 11 " - No action possible 1 " - Absolute discharge 1 " - Conditional discharge 1 " - Case dismissed Registration of Food Hawkers Under the provisions of the Essex County Council Act 1952, Section 103, 8 persons were registered as food hawkers during the year. The vehicles used in connection with the businesses were inspected and action taken in appropriate cases. Imported Food Regulations. 1968 The volume of imported food being received at depots in the borough continued to increase in volume and variety. The amount of time being required to inspect and take samples reached the point where the Health Committee recommended that the establishment of the inspectorate be increased to meet the situation. Clerical resources are also coming under strain since the volume of documents and certificates requiring attention corresponds to the amount of trade passing through the transit depots. A small amount of food for export was certified as fit for human consumption following examination. 67 Food and Drues Act, 1955 - Sampling Article Number Examined Number Adulterated Formal Informal Formal Informal Beverages 1 5 - 1 Biscuits - 2 - - Bread - 14 - 10 Butter 2 3 - 1 Cakes and Pastries - 4 - 1 Cereals 1 6 - 1 Cheese - 2 - - Condiments - 1 - - Confectionery - 17 - - Cordials 1 6 - - Cream - 2 - - Custard Powder - 1 - - Dessert - 1 - - Fat 2 - - - Fish 2 5 1 - Flavourings - 14 - 1 Flour - 3 - - Fruit Juices - 13 - 2 Fruit and Nuts - 5 - 1 Fruit, Tinned - 3 - 1 Grills - 1 - - Herbs - 2 - - Jelly - 2 - - Heat 11 9 1 5 Meat, Tinned - 3 - - Medicines - 4 - 3 Milk 10 1 - 1 Milk, Tinned - 2 - - Preserves - 2 - - Puddings - 2 - 1 Sauce - 5 - - Savouries - 3 - - Seasonings - 1 - 1 Soup - 2 - - Spices and Pickles - 11 - - Spreads - 4 - - Sweets 1 19 - 2 Vegetables - 11 - 2 Wines and Spirits 4 1 - - 68 Sample No. Article Formal or Informal Nature of Adulteration or Irregularity Observations 751A Bacon Grill Informal Contained two fragments of cotton thread discoloured by iron sulphide.

The caterer, a local firm, was the common denominator! having provided full services to all the functions. However, after investigations by this and neighbouring authorities of some 500 guests, and tracing the food supplies, the line of infection wa6 located at a butcher's premises in a neighbouring borough. 75 The causative organisms, S. saint-paul, a common occurrence in poultry, was found in the shop and the practice of storing cooked and uncooked turkeys allowed for the cross contamination of the poultry served at some of the weddings. During these investigations it was noted that some of the halls used for weddings and other forms of reception were poorly equipped. It seems that the public, when seeking a cheap premises, often subject caterers to small dingy kitchens lacking hot water and suitable working surfaces. This is so prevalent that mobile caterers in fact carry their own washing, cooking and preparation equipment. The whole matter requires most careful investigation and evaluation, and I am calling for a report from my inspectors with a view to improving existing halls. 76
