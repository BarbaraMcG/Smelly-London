The different diseases are thus tabulated :— Erysipelas 21 Diphtheria 36 Puerperal 1 Scarlet Fever 67 Small Pox 1 Typhoid Fever 26 152 Forty-nine of these cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital at Chadwell Heath or to Barking, pending the completion of our own Hospital. The following is a succinct account of the different infectious diseases requiring action by your sanitary officials during the year. My practice is to request the Sanitary Inspector to visit each house as soon as I receive notification of the existence of infectious disease there, visiting myself subsequently all those cases which I consider require my doing so. Small Pox.—One case was notified. This occurred at the "West Ham Small Pox Hospital, which is situated in the Parish of Dagenham. Scarlet Fever.—Sixty-seven cases of this disease were notified from various parts of the district—the localities where it prevailed being, in the order of the number of cases, as under:— Hornchurch and neighbourhood 37 Dagenham „ „ 22 Havering „ „ 0 Rainham and Wennington 2 Upminster and Neighbourhood 5 Collier Row 0 Great Warley 1 67 10 Diphtheria.—Twenty-five cases occurred in the localities specified as under:— Dagenham 25 Collier Row 0 Hornchurch 6 Great Warley 2 Rainham and Wennington 1 Upminster and Corbets Tey 2 36 Typhoid.—Forty-nine cases of Typhoid Fever occurred in the district as under:— Dagenham, Beacontree Heath, and Chadwell Heath 10 Hornchurch 4 XJpminster and Cranham 1 Rainham 6 Great Warley 5 26 The only disease which assumed an epidemic form was Scarlet Fever. In the village of Hornchurch and its vicinity the disease evidently spread through the medium of one of the Elementary Schools, a child undoubtedly having been admitted there whilst convalescent from a mild attack of Scarlet Fever unrecognised at the time. The school was closed, and when several of the children lived in a house where a case occurred, the patient was removed, as a rule, to the Isolation Hospital. II.— An account of the Sanitary condition of the District generally, at the end of 1900. In complying with this section of the Local Government Board's instructions to Medical Officers of Health, I proceed to give, as in 11 previous years, a short account of the sanitary state of the district, under the same heads of localities as are given in the statistical tables. Dagenham, Beacontree Heath, and Chadwell Heath.— Villages and scattered groups of houses, all situated in the parish of Dagenham, and occupying a very wide area, standing on gravel and on London clay, some (part of Dagenham village and immediate neighbourhood) on alluvium. Estimated population, 5,500. Agricultural. Water supply mainly from South Essex Company. The village of Dagenham is in a had Sanitary condition, owing to the ground being saturated by years' overflowing cesspools and slop-water. Most of the cottages supplied with pail closets, emptied once a week by the Sanitary Authority. A system of scavenging is now in force, the owners of cottages having been called upon by the Sanitary Authority to provide dust-bins, which are periodically emptied by the Authority. There still exists, though, a condition of soil sodden by sewage overflow from cesspools, and which nothing but some system of drainage will relieve, and until this is done, the village must continue to be in a bad Sanitary condition. Birth-rate, 34.7. Death-rate, 163. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 2.3 per 1,000 of the population. A complete system of sewage removal has been decided upon, and now rests with the Local Government Board. Havering stands high on pebble sand, bounded by London and boulder clay. Population 508. Agricultural. Privies. Watersupply from wells and from South Essex Company. Some of the out-lying parts of the parish badly supplied, the source in these instances being from ponds. Birth-rate 15.7; Death-rate 9 8; Death-rate from Zymotic disease, Nil Hornchurch.—Large village, and scattered groups of houses extending over a large parochial area. Part of the parish adjoining the town of Romford, and really constituting a portion of that town. Stands mostly on gravel and partly on London clay, some small portion of the parish running down to the Thames, and alluvial. Population, 4,800, principally agricultural, foundry works and a brewery in the village. A good part of the village supplied with pail closets, other houses drain into cesspools, many of which overflow into 12 ditches, and, with the brewery, pollute the neighbouring stream to a considerable extent. Birth-rate, 33.6. Death-rate, 140. Death-rate from zymotic disease, 1.0. A system of sewearage for the whole of this district is now in course of construction, which will much improve its sanitary condition. Upminster, Cranham, and Corbets Tey.—Adjacent villages, standing on high ground, mostly brick earth, some gravel. Population 2,020. Agricultural. Privies and cesspools. Some few of the latter polluting roadside ditches. Water supply mostly from South Essex Company; some wells. Birth-rate, 25.4. Death-rate, 15.3. Deathrate from zymotic disease, 0.9. A system of sewerage for the locality has been carried out and is now in operation. Great Warley stands high on London clay. The most thicklypopulated part of the parish joins the town of Brentwood, in the Billericay Union, the larger area of the parish having scattered houses and groups of houses. Population 1,970. Agricultural. A system of sewerage has been recently adopted for the populous portion of this locality, the sewage being taken at a distance and treated on the septic principle of purification. This, so far, is a great success, there is not the least nuisance in the locality of the Sewage Works, and the effluent, after running over land in furrows, is perfectly clear and inodorous. Water supply for the locality mainly from the South Essex Works; some wells. The more sparsely-populated rural part of the locality is badly supplied, ponds being a main source of supply in some parts. Birth-rate, 35.5. Death-rate, 15.2. Deathrate from zymotic disease, 0.5. Rainham and Winnington lie low on gravel and alluvium at the edge of the Thames. Marshy. Village of 2,300 inhabitants. Agricultural and river traffic. Tidal stream runs through Rainham to the Thames, about one mile distant. No system of sewage removal. Privies and cesspools. Foul state of atmosphere frequent from factories on river bank (manure, candles, glue, &c.), some on the Essex, most on the Kent side of the river. Water supply mostly from South Essex Company; some wells. Birth-rate, 33 4. Death-rate, 9 6. Death-rate from zymotic disease, Nil. 13 III.—An account of the enquiries as to the conditions injurious to health existing in the district, and of the proceedings relating to such conditions in which advice has been given, &c., &c. In addition to the cases of infectious diseases record in Section I. of this report, the following insanitary conditions, &c., necessitated official interference by the Sanitary Inspector, who called in my assistance when necessary.

The Birth and Death Rates are shown in the following table for tho last five years. The system of sewerage for Upminster and neighbourhood has been satisfactorily completed. A system is now being constructed for Harold Wood, and for the Village, and more populous parts of Hornchurch Parish, and a system for Dagenham and Bcacontree Heath is, I believe, now awaitiug the approval of the Local Government Board. The New Isolation Hospital (situate between Romford and Dagenham, in a fairly central part of the district) is now completed, and is to be opened next month. 22 23 Diseases of a zymotic character proved fatal in 22 instances ; the death-rate from this class of disease for the entire district having been 1.2 per 1,000. The following table shows the nature and distribution of fatal zymotic disease in the different localities of the district:— Dagenham. Havering. Upminster and Cranham. Great Warley.
