Borough of Malden and Coombe Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health AND THE Chief Public Health Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1962 (1) BOROUGH OF MALDEN AND COOMBE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1962 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. July, 1963. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1962 which has been prepared in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular 1/63. The general health of the district remains good and the statistics recorded are comparable to those for the country as a whole. There was one fairly extensive outbreak of Sonne dysentery which is referred to later in the report, but the favourable position with regard to tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diphtheria experienced in recent years has been maintained. For the second consecutive year no deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis were recorded. The work of the department has extended a good deal in recent years and it has been necessary to appoint an additional Public Health Inspector. This has made it possible for the Inspectors to spend more time on educational and survey work as well as undertaking additional duties in the field of old people's welfare, where the standard of housing and environmental hygiene so often presents a problem. After many years service the Public Health Nurse Mrs. M. J. Butler was compelled to resign for personal reasons. Her work in connection with the elderly of the (2) Borough has teen very valuable over the years and her special experience prevented or solved many social and health problems. This work is now done by the Health Visitors of the County Council and infectious disease investigation and control is carried out by Public Health Inspectors. CARE OF THE ELDERY. The gradual expansion of services for the care of the elderly continues. There is no doubt that these services will need to develop very considerably in the future to cater for increasing numbers of elderly people in the community. Indication of how this may be done in a way complementary to the 10 year plans of the County Council and Regional Hospital Board was contained in a very excellent report produced by a Working Party and submitted to the County Council at the end of 1962. Specialised Housing provision will obviously be of prime importance and the implementation of the Council's plans for erection of House-Mother units in this district will render a tremendous service to those fortunate enough to qualify for them,, It is extremely difficult to evaluate the precise needs of the future in terms of numbers of places. The position must be reviewed from time to time in the light of experience gained and other developments which may take place. At the end of 1962 there were 10 House-Mother places and approximately 130 dwellings suitable for housing the elderly. while future plans envisage a considerable increase in both these types of housing provision . The Council also actively supports the Maiden Housing Association which has been able to provide 29 flatlets for old people. The provision of homes specially designed to meet the needs of the elderly will do much to reduce the demand for places in Residential Establishments, achieving the desirable object of enabling them to live in their own homes for a much longer period than would otherwise be the case. At the same time it must be remembered that this in itself will in the future create problems for the domiciliary services. SMOKING AND HEALTH. Evidence continues to accrue of the harmful effects of heavy smoking, deaths from cancer of the lung remaining at the high level of recent times, although a slight reduction is recorded for 1962. During the year an effort was made to present the facts of this situation in an acceptable way to secondary school children by the use of a mobile exhibition produced by the Central Council for Health Education. This was well received and night with advantage be repeated in the future. Posters and pamphlets have been distributed and every opportunity used to discourage smoking. However , such measures are only of limited value, so many youngsters have a picture of smoking as being part of normal adult (3) behaviour that they cannot be expected to do other than follow the example of their elders. It will be many years before smoking becomes a socially unacceptable habit and meanwhile we can expect the number of persons dying from diseases associated with it to remain high. ACCIDENTS IN THE HCME. An analysis of returns received from the Ambulance Service is shown in the table below. These figures show only those accidents to which an ambulance was called and do not by any means present a complete picture of the total number of home accidents which occurred in the district. It is well known that those most vulnerable to accidents in the home are children under five and adults over 65 years of age. The Council decided to exercise their powers under the Home Safety Act, 1961, by providing educational material directed mainly to the elderly and posters and pamphlets were distributed to Old People's Clubs through the Old People's Welfare Association. The Medical Officer of Health also addressed meetings on the subject of Home Safety and films were shown. In addition Health Visitors,, District Nuraes and Home Helps were reminded of the different aspects of the subject and were asked to be specially aware of dangers in the home when visiting elderly people and young children. Overdose of drugs or poisoning Coal gas poisoning Burns and scalds Palls Other minor injuries Suffocation Children - - 7 25 10 - Adults 14 3 1 29 12 2 Ten deaths of Maiden residents are recorded as being the result of accidents other than road accidents. In the tables and comment which follow will be found a summary of statistics relating to these and other matters, while the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector presents a summary of the extensive routine visiting and sampling which is carried out in the Borough by his staff. Such vigilance continues to be necessary and indeed the routine work of the Inspectors increases with each successive year. (4) In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the interest and support of members of the Public Health Committee and Council during the year and to thank the staff of the department for their wholehearted work. I am , Mr, Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. WESTCOMBE. Medical Officer of Health. (5) PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Acute Poliomyelitis No case of poliomyelitis was notified during 1962. The introduction of Oral (Sabin) vaccine necessitated recasting the vaccination programme. Par some years the number of injections necessary to protect children against serious infectious disease has been a source of concern and the ease of administration of the new vaccine by mouth has been a welcome innovation. In addition Sabin vaccine has other advantages in the type and degree of immunity produced. It represents a considerable step forward in the control of poliomyelitis. Diphtheria The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year: Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 544 , school 45) 589 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 693 For the 15th year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. Whooping Cough The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 15. No deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities far immunisation which are available. 516 children were immunised during the year and 249 received a reinforcing dose. (6) Tetanus Inoculation against tetanus has been available since 1956 and is now widely accepted. Although not a common disease, the mortality rate is high and immunisation is recommended. 580 children were immunised during the year and 660 received a reinforcing dose. No cases were notified. Smallpox During the early part of the year the department was much occupied with the surveillance and vaccination of contacts of smallpox both from abroad and from infected areas of Great Britain. That no cases occurred in the district is a tribute to the vigilance of our colleagues in less fortunate areas where outbreaks were reported. The very considerable increase in numbers of vaccinations and revaccinations carried out during the year reflects the anxiety felt by the general public. No general measures to encourage vaccination of persons other than contacts were taken. but special clinic sessions were arranged to answer the increased demand. Plans were made in collaboration with public health departments of neighbouring authorities for immediate implementation should cases have occurred locally. One striking feature which was brought to notice was the very large number of persons who travel about the country in the course of their daily work. Details of the number of vaccinations carried out during the year are as follows: Number of primary vaccinations 929 (451) Number of revaccinaticms 572 (89) (Previous year's figures in parentheses). Of the above, 746 persons were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners and 314 of those vaccinated were under 1 year of age, 56.7% of the number of births. Scarlet Fever The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 11, giving an incidence rate of 0.24 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild. (7) Measles There was a small extensive epidemic of Measles during the first half of the year, 336 cases being notified. There were no deaths recorded from this disease. Intestinal Infections An extensive outbreak of Sonne dysentery occured in November and December. This was centred mainly around a Primary school in the Borough and involved 65 cases in all. The staff of the school, the parents and their family doctors and the laboratory co-operated splendidly and by exercising rigorous control the epidemic was quickly contained. In all 465 specimens were sent for bacteriological examination by the Public Health Laboratory at Epsom . Apart from and unassociated with this outbreak 9 other cases of Sonne dysentery occurred during the year in 6 families. Three of these were associated with communal nurseries. One case was returned as food poisoning caused by Salmonella bredeney0 Although no direct source of infection could be traced, there was strong presumptive evidence that the infection originated from infected imported ham. Salmonella typhi-murium infection was responsible for illness in two children and Salmonella blockley was discovered in association with a case notified as Sonne dysentery. In none of these cases was there any indication of food borne infection. The prevention of intestinal infection is essentially one of scrupulous attention to personal and domestic hygiene. This needs to be taught from a very early age by parents and teachers, while the employment of untrained personnel in kitchens and food establishments where food stuffs are handled is to be deprecated. Non-notifiable Diseases Head teachers of Local Edcuatian Authority schools notify cases of non-notifiable disease occurring in their schools. This is a useful procedure which is much appreciated. German Measles and Chickenpox were the two most prevalent during the year.

July, 1963. To the Mayer, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe, Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1962. Staff changes were less than in previous years and the work of the department proceeded with little of the disturbance which naturally follows the departure of a member of the staff and before a new colleague becomes acquainted with the area and the nature of his tasks. The Public Health Nurse resigned in October and the post of Additional Public Health Inspector was not filled until the middle of December. Mr. Brackfield passed the Smoke Inspectors Examination of the Royal Society of Health, Mr. Cava continued his day release course at the South-East London Technical College, Mr. Coker attended a course an public health administration at Trinity Hall, Cambridge and I attended a course in Radioactivity at Brunei College, Acton. During the year assistance was given to the Midwife Teachers Training College and to Gipsy Hill Training College in connection with their health education studies. (20) It is pleasing to report that considerable progress has been made in the work of establishing smoke control areas in the northeastern part of the Borough. Two Orders became effective on the 1st October, 1962 and the Order for the third area has been confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The 'smog' of early December caused many deaths in the Greater London area and emphasises the need to remove pollutants from the atmosphere as soon as possible. The work of the department in connection with food hygiene and food sampling continued unabated with no dramatic incidents to report. There was a reduction in the number of applications for Improvement Grants and the Council decided to undertake a publicity drive in the Spring of 1963. The majority of the houses in the Borough possess the essential facilities of a bathroom and hot water system, but those lacking these amenities are, by modern standards, sub-standard. Efforts will be made to encourage owners and, in particular, landlords to improve houses,, It is regretted that the incentive to landlords in the form of a rent increase of 12½% of their share of the cost of improvement has failed to produce a spate of applications. The year was marked by periods of great activity caused by outbreaks of Smallpox and Poliomyelitis in other parts of the country and by the outbreak of Dysentery within the Borough. The department has co-operated with the Forest Products Research Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in connection with the control of timber pests and atmospheric pollution respectively. There was a reduction in the work done by the department in connection with eradication of insect pests, chiefly due to the adverse weather conditions which prevailed for most of t he year and the County Council's decision to discontinue the department's routine treatment of school kitchens to prevent infestation. The increased day to day contact by Public Health Inspectors with members of the County Council health and welfare services was a feature of the year's work and it is to be hoped that this will continue. I am pleased to record my thanks to the members of the Council far their support throughout the year,, to Dr. Westcombe for his encouragement and to the members of the staff of this and other departments for their co-operation. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. E„ KINTON. Chief Public Health Inspector. (21) HOUSING The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year- (a) by the Council 35 (b) by private enterprise 103 Number of houses in course of construction- (a) by the Council 38 (b) by private enterprise 129 Per the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served- Preliminary 18 Abatement 11 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the district. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, as amended by the Housing Act, 1961, provides for local authorities to make grants to owners for improvement of their property. There are two types of grant available, the 'Standard' and the 'Discretionary' grant. The 'Standard Grant' is available for the cost of installing a bath, water closet in or readily accessible from within the building, hot water system, wash hand basin and satisfactory facilities for storing food. The local authority must approve a grant provided the dwelling is likely to remain fit for human habitation for not less than 15 years and the applicant has a freehold interest or a leasehold interest of which not less than 15 years remains unexpired. The maximum amount of 'Standard Grant' which is 50% of the cost of carrying out the work, shall not exceed £155 if all the following facilities are provided. The maximum amount of grant payable for each facility is as follows: (22) Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom £25 Wash hand basin £5 Hot water supply £75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling. £40 Satisfactory facilities far storing food £10 On completion, the dwelling must possess all the above amenities. The Council has continued to give 'Discretionary Grants' far works of improvement or conversion up to a cost of £800 and subject to a grant up to 50% of this cost. Generally speaking Discretionary Grants are given where extensive work is necessary to provide modern amenities, for example, the construction of a bathroom extension to an existing house. The Housing Act, 1961, came into operation in October, 1961, and authorised an increase in the rent by 12½% of the cost incurred by the owner in carrying out the improvements made to property. In a Circular issued in April, 1962, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government made it quite clear that every facility should be given to encourage the making of grants in suitable cases and to preserve structurally sound houses with a substantial life by improving their amenities. As a result the Council decided to publicise improvement grants by posters and by exhibitions and to survey selected roads with a view to encouraging owners to improve their properties. Later in the year the Ministry urged all local authorities to undertake such publicity. During the year numerous enquiries were made by ratepayers and advice was given. Although many did not avail themselves of the facilities offered, a considerable amount of work has been carried out. The following tables show the number of grants approved and payments made during the year: Standard Grants.

(24) MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT Inspections were made but it was not necessary to take any formal action during the year. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 1955 In June Mr. J. A. Palgrave, B.Sc., F.R.I.C., was appointed as Deputy Public Analyst. During the year 156 samples were submitted to the Council's Public Analyst, Mr. D. D. Moir, M.Sc., F.R.I.C., 16, Southwark Street, S.E.1. whose expert advice is gratefully acknowledged. The samples have been selected from a wide range of commodities, most of which were found to be genuine.

The manufacturers amended their label and the complaint was referred to the Trade Office of the exporting country. The use of the term "corned beef loaf" was regarded as being an unsatisfactory description of the product and did not indicate the true nature of the article and details of the case were submitted for consideration by the Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Incidentally, the report of the Food Standards Committee on canned meat products was published during the year. Black Currants in Heavy Syrup, A tin of black currants was found to contain syrup but not heavy syrup. There followed a lengthy correspondence but the manufacturers were unable to account for the discrepancy. School Milk. Two informal samples of school milk were found to have added water. The dairy company co-operated in investigations to find the cause, but without success. Subsequent samples proved to be satisfactory. Hawaiian Punch. A sample of Hawaiian Punch was found to be a soft drink of fruit juices and flavourings. As punch is a term normally applied to a spirituous liquor the manufacturers were requested to amend the description. This was agreed and the product is now marketed as Hawaiian Crush. Cream Slice. A cream slice was found to contain a substance resembling cream but consisting of imitation cream. As both kinds of slice were sold by the shop concerned the Manageress was advised on the need far care in labelling. MILK The following licences have been issued under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, for the period ending 31st December, 1965: Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licence. Tuberculin tested 11 Pasteurised 18 Sterilised 10 Milk Bottles. There was a considerable improvement in the condition of milk bottles distributed in the Borough following strong representations to one dairy company in the previous year. (28) details of milk testing class OF milk number of samples tested appropriate tests number op samples passed FAILED void Pasteurised 39 Phosphatase 39 - - Methylene blue 36 - 3 Sterilised 2 Turbidity 2 - - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 22 Phosphatase 22 - - Methylene blue 19 - 3 Tuberculin tested (Raw) 3 Methylene blue 2 1 - Tuberculin tested (Farm Bottled) 2 Biological 2 - - The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. Void samples are those received at the laboratory at a time when atmospheric shade temperature exceeds 65°f. The sample which failed to pass the Methylene blue test was purchased from a vending machine and subsequent samples proved to be satisfactory. (29) FOOD There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district bytype of business together with the number of inspections. Food Premises No. in District No. of Inspections Made Bakehouses 5 13 Bakers shops 14 16 Butchers 20 45 Confectioners 29 38 Cooked meat shops 2 16 Clubs, sports etc 18 1 Pish shops (wet or fried) 12 17 Greengrocers 23 42 Greengrocers stalls. 2 15 Grocers (including off-licences) 60 78 Guest house 1 2 Institutions 17 10 Office and works canteens 15 8 Public houses and hotels 12 10 Restaurants and cafes 16 19 School canteens 14 6 260 336 The following premises are registered under Section 16 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, for the purposes listed.

In two instances the Council decided to prosecute and in those instances where the food was sold in other Boroughs the complaint was referred to the Public Health Department concerned. Bread. A complaint was received concerning black foreign matter smeared on the crust of a loaf of bread. This was fbund to be mineral grease and the bakery company was advised of the Council's concern in this matter. The purchaser of a brown loaf of bread found that it contained a small quantity of white patches. This was found to be white dough and the manufacturer was advised of the complaint. The Council decided to prosecute when the purchaser of a loaf of bread found that it contained a steel bolt an inch in length. The company was fined £25- 0. 0. with £10. 10. 0. costs. A fine of £30 was imposed and £3 costs were awarded to the Council following the prosecution of a baker who sold a loaf of bread containing foreign matter. (31) Bread Roll. A housewife brought a roll to the office and alleged that it had contained a piece of glass. An examination of the food glassware in the kitchen revealed no broken crockery. The staff of the Department were not satisfied and returned to the house later when a further and mare thorough search was carried out and, to their surprise, they found a broken butter dish in the heart of the kitchen fire. No further action was taken. Buttered Roll. A complaint was received of two small glass splinters in the mouth after eating a slice of buttered bread. There was no evidence to prove that the glass had originally been in the butter or the bread. Buttered Bun. A complaint was received of a nail in a buttered bun. After a thorough examination in the bakers snop and the provision merchants supplying the butter, no proof was obtained how the nail had gained access to the bun. Danish Pastry. The purchaser of a Danish Pastry produced this delicacy with what appeared to be a rat dropping on the surface. On examination it proved to be a small piece of cleaning material. Macaroon. When a macaroon was sold to a resident it contained fragments of what appeared to be coal, but on examination it was found to be siliceous matter. The bakery company in this instance was advised that the Public Health Committee viewed a complaint of this nature as a serious matter. Biscuits. On finding a weevil in a packet of biscuits a shop-keeper surrendered the remainder of his stock and the wholesalers checked on all stock in their care. Milk. A complaint was received of the finding of a crude substance adhering to the bottom of a bottle of milk. It was found to be firmly fixed to the glass and the bottle was obviously clean. When a complaint was received concerning a crack in a bottle of milk, it was obviously due to mishandling and it was referred to the dairy company concerned. A half pint bottle of milk wasfbund to contain foreign material adhering to the side and was identified as mould. On examination of the milk it was found to be normal in composition and contained no foreign deposit or sediment. The Public Health Committee expressed its concern that a bottle should have been sent cut in this condition and advised the dairy company accordingly. A bottle of milk delivered by a local roundsman appeared to be dirty on the inside. On examination it was found to be milk residue. In this instance the dairy company was advised of the Public Health Committee's concern and informed that a serious view would be taken of a repetition. (32) Canned Milk. A complaint was made concerning the condition of milk in a tin of evaporated milk. Apart from a slightly sour smell, it appeared to be perfectly sound, but was referred to the Public Analyst and the manufacturers who both confirmed that the milk was satisfactory. Ham. A complaint was received concerning the unsoundness of ham purchased in a sealed wrapper and on submittion to the bacteriologist, no abnormality was found. Prawns. A small quantity of prawns were brought to the Public Health Department on the grounds that they were unsound. On examination they were regarded as being in 'border line' condition. The stock in the shop concerned was inspected and the manager was advised to dispose of twenty pints. Red Plums. On opening a can of red plums, the purchaser was surprised to find a wasp. The company concerned was advised and the complaint was investigated by them. ICE CREAM Fifty samples were submitted to the methylene blue test. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not mare than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947:- (33) Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 — 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 — 0 - 1958 56 56 100.0 0 — 0 - 1959 38 38 100.0 0 — 0 — 1960 46 46 100.0 0 — 0 — 1961 58 57 98.3 1 1.7 0 - 1962 50 50 100.0 0 - 0 - During recent years there has been a tendency far ice-cream to be marketed by a few companies with adequate facilities for maintaining the high standard required for this product. This trend has culminated in the merger of some of the biggest producers, leaving few competitors in the field of bulk production and retail distribution. This simplifies sampling procedures but does not necessarily reduce the need for vigilance. A feature of this trade which is viewed with some ccticern is the public demand for a soft ice-cream, which, unlike wrapped ice-cream is made at the point of sale and is liable to be contaminated. PREPACKED MEAT PRODUCTS During the year 7 samples of meat and ham products were submitted for bacteriological examination fraa a shop in the Borough which had .just commenced pre-packing this type of food. All were reported upon as being bacteriologically satisfactory. (34) CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT. 1961 This Act, which perpetuates regulations made under the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, requires that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year and advice was given to traders dealing in second-hand appliances,, RAG FLOCK MP OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1 951 One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. Two samples were submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report on each. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications far renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT. 1 950 There are 400 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting, ventilation and shop hours relating to early closing and Sunday trading. At the request of the hairdressers and barbers the Order requiring them to close on either Wednesday or Saturday afternoon was revoked and all traders in the town new have the same freedom to choose their early closing day. (35) REFUSE TIP AM) REFUSE DISPOSAL Refuse from the area is collected under the direction of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and transported to a loading bay used jointly by this Council, the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames and the Borough of Surbitan. From the loading bay the refuse is conveyed by contractors to disused gravel pits at Egham. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION The duties of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, were fully carried out and householders appreciate the free service which has been maintained. A charge is made for the treatment of business premises, sane of which are liable to frequent infestation. Many traders have entered into an annual agreement with the Council to provide a comprehensive inspection and destruction service. This service is also used by the Surrey County Council far their school kitchens, old peoples hemes and nurseries. The resultant prompt discovery or notification of the presence of rats or mice and their immediate treatment ensures that serious infestations do not occur. The Borough river boundaries, depots, sewage disposal works, refuse tip and open spaces have received constant attention. The efforts of the staff coupled with the co-operation of those of adjoining authorities have maintained effective control. Constant liaison has been maintained with the officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Workable Area Committee meetings have been held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of pest control were discussed« Following the successful 10% test baiting of sewers in 1961, when no evidence of infestation was found, it was decided to defer treatment of sewers. PIGEONS Pigeons continue to be a source of nuisance to residents in parts of the Borough. The Public Health Act, 1961, gave power to reduce the number of pigeons in built-up areas and action has been taken to eliminate the nuisance. (36) INSECT PESTS As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests. Nuisance was experienced from wasps during the summer and the department gave all possible assistance and advice. 56 wasp nests were destroyed and the cost of the work was recovered from the occupiers of the premises. 13 rooms were treated for infestations of bugs and 8 rooms for fleas. 60 council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. A survey of houses for evidence of dry rot and timber infestation was commenced daring the year to ascertain the extent of nuisance from these sources. The very successful treatment of school kitchens with residual insecticide was discontinued by "the Surrey County Council. Infestations of mites in houses and flats recently erected on vacant land proved to be a new problem for the department and the advice of the Pest Infestation Laboratory of the Agricultural Research Council has been sought. CARAVANS There are no caravan sites in the Borough and no licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. WATER SUPPLY The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. (37) RAINFALL The following table shows the rainfall in the district during 1962, taken at the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board works, Kingston Vale and Manor Park.

DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE With the exception of a small quantity which is discharged to the sewage disposal works of the Borough of Sutton and Cheam at Worcester Park and to the Wandle Valley Joint Sewage Board, the sewage of the district is treated at the modern works of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board, situated within the Borough. (38) CLEAN AIR Smoke Control Areas. The progress reported in the last Annual Report has been maintained. On the 1st October, 1962 the No.1 . and No.2. Smoke Control Orders came into operation and few difficulties were experienced. The survey of No.3. Smoke Control Area was completed ard. the Order confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The Order which covers the area bounded by the main railway line from New Maiden eastwards to the Borough boundary, southward along Beverley Park to Maiden Way, then westward to the Maiden roundabout and northward to New Maiden Railway Station, comes into operation on the 1st October, 1963. The survey of No.4. Smoke Control Area was commenced during the year. The Ministry simplified the procedure on preparing and submitting details of a proposed Smoke Control Area, but it was decided to retain all the advantages which accrue from a personal visit to every house in the area. In response to a request from the Minister to review the smoke control programme the Council decided to adhere to its previous decision to make the target date for dealing with the whole Borough by 1972. It was decided to introduce an additional area to come into operation in 1965 covering part of Kingstan-upon-Thames Borough Council housing estate at Narbitan where extensive improvements to the properties are planned. During the year 5,705 visits were made in connection with Smoke Control Areas. Numerous demonstrations were organised during the year and the Mobile Exhibition vehicle of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation proved to be of great value. The co-operation of the Gas and Electricity Boards showroom and technical staff and the builders in the district proved t o be of great value to the department in giving accurate information and assisting residents generally. (39) It was hoped to publish a brochure relating to Smoke Control, but the firm engaged on the project was unable to secure sufficient advertisements. A pamphlet produced in the department for distribution to householders in proposed areas is inserted as an appendix to this report. A statistical summary is also appended. Clean Air Act. 1955. Nine notices of intention to instal furnaces with a rating exceeding 55,000 British thermal units or more per hour were received. During the year 71 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement. Atmospheric Pollution - Recording. The following tables show the daily average, and highest and lowest concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide expressed in microgrammes per cubic metre for the years 1959 - 1962 recorded at New Maiden and Kingston Vale.

NOISE ABATEMENT No formal action was necessary under the provisions of the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, but a number of complaints were dealt with informally. The Act provides that a complaint of the existence of a nuisance may be made by three or more persons each of whom is the occupier of land or premises and in that capacity is aggrieved by the nuisance. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration from aircraft and in proceedings it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means have been adopted for preventing the nuisance.

As Chairman of the Committee responsible far promoting health within the Borough, I am pleased to write the foreword of this pamphlet. It concerns the introduction of smoke control areas which will ensure the cleanliness of the air in that part of the Borough in which you live. Par many years we have been accustomed to drinking clean water, walking in clean streets and enjoying the benefits of clean food. Now a great effort is being made by local authorities in the Greater London Area to clean the air. This is as important a public health measure as the introduction of piped water supplies and drains, of vaccination against smallpox and the pasteurisation of milk. It is a policy which will, when fully implemented, reduce the alarming increase in the incidence of bronchitis and other lung diseases and cut the very considerable cost of cleaning and building maintenance. I trust that you will assist the officers of the Council when they visit by permitting them to inspect your fireplaces. They will be pleased to give you advice regarding the implementation of the Clean Air Act and on your heating problems. The staff of the Public Health Department are there to help you - do not hesitate to seek their advice. A. R. HILL. Chairman, Public Health, Works and Highways Committee. THE AIR WE BREATHE. The smog which covered the Greater London area during the early part of December in 1952, was accompanied by an immediate rise both in illness and deaths, The number of fatalities over and above those normally expected in the first three weeks of December indicated that some 4,000 people died. The Government appointed a Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver to investigate the whole question of atmospheric pollution and subsequently the Clean Air Act was passed in 1956. This Act provides for the establishment of smoke control areas. SMOKE CCNTROL - THE PLAN. Smoke Control Areas can be established by Local Authorities and the effect of an Order is to prohibit the emission of smoke from chimneys in the designated area, particularly the chimneys of houses, shops and offices. Shortly after the coming into operation of the Clean Air Act, the Maiden and Coombe Borough Council considered the problem of pollution in the immediate locality and decided to proceed with the introduction of Smoke Control Areas covering the whole of the Borough by the end of 1972. The Borough has been divided into 13 areas and each area will be dealt with in turn thereby spreading the amount of work to be done by the Council's staff, the builders, gas and electricity staffs over a reasonable period and at the same time spreading the cost to be borne by the Council and the Exchequer over a number of years. The Council decided to introduce Smoke Control Areas in the first instance along the eastern side of the Borough and commenced in the north with Kingston Vale. The whole of the north-east part of the Borough extending from Kingston Vale to Maiden Way is now covered by smoke control orders. By selecting the eastern side of the Borough, the Council's Smoke Control Areas unite with those already in existence or proposed by the Borough of Richmond, Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, the Borough of Wimbledon, the Urban District of Merton and Morden, and the Borough of Sutton and Cheam. Already a large part of Greater London is subject to smoke control orders and, whilst it is premature to draw conclusions, it is noteworthy that there were fewer deaths in the December 1962 smog compared with that of 1952. Recently there has been publicity concerning the failure of the Smoke Control Order to deal with pollutants other than smoke and in particular criticism has been directed towards the failure to prevent the emission of sulphur dioxide but there is every reason to believe that with the reduction of smoke in the atmosphere there will also be a reduction of sulphur dioxide. SMOKELESS FUELS. The Council now proposes to make the area in which you reside a Smoke Control Area. Very simply, it means that after the date when the Order becomes operative you will not be permitted to burn coal but any of the authorised fuels may be used. They are coke, anthracite, low volatile steam coal, Coalite, Phurnacite, Sebnte, Cleanglow, Rexco and similar fuels sold under various trade names, also gas and electricity. Oil fired installations are acceptable if the furnace is definitely designed and maintained for the combustion of oil fuels. In many houses the existing grates are incapable of burning tne modern fuels and in these cases the Council will be prepared to consider applications from the occupiers or owners for a grant towards the cost of converting tne appliances, for example a stool and fret into a modern approved appliance. Correspondence is addressed to the occupiers of houses and not to the owners, it being assumed that most tenants will wish to do the work themselves, particularly as this will enable them to select the fuel of tneir own choice. THE GRANT AND THE FIREPLACES, Residents will have received or will be receiving a visit from an officer of the Council who will be prepared to advise whether or not they would be eligible for a grant and he will be able to indicate the approximate amount of grant obtainable. In general, the amount of grant is 7/lOtns of the minimum cost of the appliance plus 7/lOths of the cost of fixing and providing ignition, It mast be emphasised that in order to obtain tne grant the owner or occupier must make an application to the Council for approval and the appliance which is provided must be fixed to the satisfaction of the Council. The appliance must be selected from tne list of approved appliances, and copies of the lists may be seen at the Public Health Department, Dukes Avenue, New Maiden, or at the public libraries in Kingston Road, New Maiden, Church Road, Worcester Park or Robinhood Lane, Kingston Vale. Tne basic amount which is allowed for the cost of the appliance itself is £3.15.0. for a 14 inch fireplace opening, £4. 0. 0, for a 16 inch opening and £4. 10. 0. for an 18 inch opening taking an open fire. If it is desired to provide a gas or electric appliance, then a basic figure of £4. 10. 0. is regarded as the equivalent cost. Therefore, the Council is prepared to pay 7/l0ths of £4. 10. 0. as the maximum cost of converting a fireplace plus 7/l0ths of the minimum cost of fixing and providing ignition* Under normal circumstance s a grant is payable far conversion in rooms which are regularly used, far example a living room or a sitting room, but in the case of an elderly person occupying a bed sitting room an application would be favourably considered. If it is desired to carry out mare extensive works or choose expensive appliances there is no difficulty about this, but the applicant would be eligible for a grant based on the minimum cost of the conversion. HOT TO OBTAIN THE GRANT. The Council will advise residents when to apply far grant and the applicant then has to decide what he proposes to do. The procedure is to obtain an estimate from a contractor and submit it to the Chief Public Health Inspector, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. who will advise when the Council has approved the application and the amount of grant payable. The applicant is advised to give instructions to his contractor to have the work dene without delay following receipt of the Council's written approval far in the past it has been found that immediately prior to the date of operation of a Smoke Control Area contractors receive a very large number of orders and this causes delay and inconvenience to all concerned. When the work has been commenced the Chief Public Health Inspector should be advised and the appliance will be inspected to make sure that it is satisfactorily installed. When the contractor's account is received it should be sent to the Council together with the claim form and the grant will be paid within the course of a few days if there are no discrepancies. All tenants are advised to consult their landlord before proceeding and if the work is done by the landlord he is entitled to increase the rent by 12½% per annum of the nett cost to him. FUELS AND STORAGE, The storage of smokeless fuels is a matter which should be carefully considered. Many people have been in the habit of purchasing their coal supplies during the summer months when the prices have been lowered. Users of solid smokeless fuels are strongly advised to continue the practice of ordering fuel during the summer months when they will have the benefit of the lower prices and as the last winters have shown, it is very desirable to have a stock of fuel in hand during the months of January and February when the merchants have difficulty in maintaining deliveries. For anyone who wishes to use a particular brand of fuel it is essential to stock up, but it must be pointed out that most smokeless fuels take up more room per ton than does coal, and additional bunker space should be considered. FIRE LIGHTING. Grant is payable for the provision of gas or electric ignition far smokeless fuels. Where a resident has an objection to gas, fires may be lighted by means of sticks and paper, but where other work is being done the Council is prepared to pay 7/lOths of the cost of providing an electric firelighter in suitable cases. BONFIRES. Many people will wish to know whether they may continue to burn garden rubbish. In a Smoke Control Area it will still be possible to have a garden bonfire, but it must not be a nuisance to neighbours. FURTHER INFORMATION. The Council is anxious that these measures which are being introduced for the good of all shall be done in such a way as to cause as little inconvenience as possible and it is emphasised that the staff of the Public Health Department are available to help. If you have any questions, however simple, on which you would like to have clarification, will you please communicate with the Chief Public Health Inspector either by telephone or in writing. He or a member of the staff will be pleased to visit you. The normal hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. an Monday and 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, but an evening visit can be arranged if this is necessary. In addition, most of the builders in the town, the electricians and the gas and electricity board's staffs, are fully acquainted with the procedure involved in the introduction of clean air and they will be prepared to give you advice. CCNCLUSION. Finally, the following points cannot be emphasised too strongly. The Council's approval in writing to proposals must be obtained before the work is started or appliances are ordered. The work is subject to inspection. The appliances are to be selected from the list of approved appliances and properly fixed. SMOKE CONTROL AREAS STATISTICS No.1 . No.2.
