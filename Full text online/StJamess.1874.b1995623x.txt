JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1874-1875. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1875. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, In again presenting a General Report or Summary of the various works with which I have had the honour to have been connected during the past twelve months, but little explanation is necessary, as for the most part they have not involved anything actually new, but have consisted entirely of maintaining those already in existence; and each matter in rotation has been fully entered into beforehand, either by the Vestry, or the Works Committee, or generally by both, to an extent that would render a detailed description both tedious and superfluous. The whole may be summed up as works of necessity and as well considered and digested beforehand as the circumstances of each case would permit. It is needless to state that all matters on or above the surface explain themselves: but from the exceedingly ancient date of the greater part of the buildings in the Parish the subterranean matters are by no means simple. However new a building may look, or actually be, the probabilities are that none of the old foundations have been interfered 14 with that could be left alone, for many reasons, and as all old Drains and Sewers, and all old Watercourses are not generally discovered, or any attempt made to discover them, it naturally follows that in the course of centuries most curious and baffling combinations come to light, generally involving much anxiety and no small amount of experience to reduce them to the best condition that can be attained, by which I mean simplicity and efficiency, so that apparently trifling works become of more importance than seems necessary to accomplish their ends; even the stability of the neighbouring buildings themselves requires to be taken into consideration to a far greater extent than would be imagined; and further than this, future inhabitants deserve consideration, so that the same complications shall not occur again, and a repetition of the same trouble and expense be rendered necessary. The greater part of all such works are explained as they proceed, but the difficulties sometimes happen so unexpectedly that prompt measures are constantly required to avoid both actual danger, and what is almost as bad—delay. These matters are mentioned to shew that the Works executed by the Vestry, though apparently simple, involve heavy responsibility, and great care is required that such responsibility is prevented from culminating in accident; there is cause for congratulation that hitherto this has not occurred, and I trust never will Great credit is due to the various Contractors and Tradesmen employed by the 15 Vestry, who have one and all been prompt and skilful in all the matters that have been placed in their hands to execute, and I would take the liberty of observing that the Vestry cannot be too careful in continuing tho course they have hitherto adopted in the selection of those to whom the actual performance of their work is entrusted. The Paving Works do not require any lengthened description, having been entirely confined to the maintenance of those already in existence, without much novelty being attempted. The surface of the Regent Street Roadway was made up with additional care and additional appliances, and in spite of several drawbacks at the time of the execution of this work, the result may be considered satisfactory. No doubt the whole of the Vestry, if not the whole of the Public, carefully watched the process, which once seen renders verbal description superfluous. In the length of Charles Street, Haymarket, there are four varieties of Paving, with about an equal traffic over all, which will allow of a good comparison to be made; next St. James's Square there is the American Improved Wood Paving; between that and Regent Street ordinary McAdam, that is broken Guernsey and Hoggin Gravel; from Regent Street to St. Alban's Place, Broken Guernsey and Cement, rolled with 15-ton Steam Roller; and lastly, next the Haymarket, a portion laid with broken Guernsey alone, no other material being used at all, but well rolled with steam power. Several of the observations applicable to Sewer 16 Works also affect Paving matters, especially the substratum of such Streets as have been made new, such as Regent Street, where the complication of vaults, old foundations, drains, gas and water pipes is almost incredible, but has to a certain extent to he borne in mind in forming the contour of the the surface, in fact in some instances almost dictating the way in which the work can be done at all. This circumstance also causes the necessity for a great number of openings to be made, and of course eventually to be made good; the apparently useless nature of these openings causes much speculation in the Public mind, but the actual solution is to be found in the complications just mentioned, and partly from the natural decay of the Mains and Services, which are probably the oldest in London. There is literally nothing to be said with respect to Public conveniences, the trifling work required to cleanse and repair the by no means perfect ones in use is scarcely worth mentioning. The Improvements in some of the Public Lamps are no doubt a gain to the Parish, but as they were executed by private individuals at their own cost can hardly come under the head of Vestry work, although as they are now Vestry or Parish property it would be a great improvement if more gas could be supplied to them, the present quantity being manifestly inadequate and actually below the average, especially for such situations. Of course a great deal more has been done, or 17 tried to be done, by the Vestry, the Works Committee, and the Officers, both in investigating every new kind of Paving that has appeared and in the attempted construction of Public conveniences. Nothing has been left undone to try and accomplish the latter, but the circumstances that have rendered most attempts abortive are too recent to require explanation, and not altogether too satisfactory to look back upon. Personally, I am bound to state that I think the fears, genuine enough, entertained of evil arising from the construction, as proposed, are generally very much exaggerated and excessive. In addition to Works actually executed, the Preliminary Plans, Specifications, Tenders, and Committee Meetings, not only require a great deal of the time of the Members of the Vestry, but are a guarantee of the care and attention bestowed by them upon all matters that come before them, and nothing is ever rejected or passed over without full and in most instances almost exhaustive discussion. I cannot conclude without personally thanking the Members of Vestry and Committees for the courtesy with which, as one of their Officers, I am habitually treated, and for continued confidence, which I trust will long be enjoyed. I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir, and Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, A. P. HOWELL.

Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit for the year 1874 the following Report upon the Public Health of that important section of London known as the Parish of St. James, Westminster. It will be in your recollection that my own duties as the Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst commenced with the year 1875. The present Report, therefore, is based upon the materials which I find recorded by the late distinguished gentleman, Dr. Edwin Lankester, my predecessor in office. I may premise by reminding you that St. James's Parish covers an area of 164 statute acres. It is, for the registration of Births and Deaths, constituted a "District" by itself, and is divided into three "Sub-Districts" —that of St. James's Square with an area of 85 acres, that of Golden Square with an area of 54 acres, and that of Berwick Street with an area of 25 acres. 24 The density of the population, taking as a basis the enumeration of 1871, is 205 persons per acre. The Sub-Districts, however, vary greatly in this respect, that of St. James's Square having only 123 persons per acre, while that of Golden Square has 238, and that of Berwick Street no less than 411. The numbers and distribution of the population at each of the last five decennial enumerations are shown by the following figures:—* Census. St. James's District, Area 164 acres. St. James's Square Sub-District, Area 85 acres. Golden Square Sub-District, Area 54 acres. Berwick Street Sub-District, Area 25 acres. 1831 37,053 1841 37,398 13,337 13,612 10,449 1851 36,406 11,469 14,139 10,798 1861 35,326 10,753 13,966 10,607 1871 33,619 10,472 12,860 10,287 It thus appears that since 1841 the population of St. James's has been continuously decreasing, and that now it numbers some four thousands less than it did thirty years ago. This exceptional condition follows from the fact that St. James's has long since been fully built over, and that, of late years, it has increasingly become the centre for Clubs, Hotels, and splendid shops, retailing goods which are often unique in their quality and artistic value. The result has been an enormous rise in the value of houses and a gradual extrusion of the less wealthy and important residents. * The first line of figures cannot be completed, as the Sub-District areas were not formed until 1837. 25 Daring the year 1874 the following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's:— First Quarter 181 Second Quarter 148 Third Quarter 112 Fourth Quarter 194 635 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners Dying in the Workhouse 30 Dying in the Throat Hospital 13 43 592 592 deaths in a population of 33,500 is a death rate of nearly 18 per 1000. The mortality of St. James's during the last four years has been:— Year 1871 Deaths 680 „ 1872 ,, 620 „ 1873 ,, 629 „ 1874 ,, 592 The previous average of deaths in St. James's having been 730 for each year, the 592 deaths in 1874 are no less than 138 below the average. The following table shows the periods of life in which the deaths have occurred in the last three years respectively. It will be observed that the mortality of infants and young children was much diminished during the year 1874. 26 1872. Under 1 Year. Above 1 and under 5. Above 5 and under 20. Above 20 and under 40.

Tables of Food Analyses also are appended. In the table of analyses made upon articles sent for that purpose by the public, it will be noted that only two specimens are reported as having been found to be adulterated. One—a specimen of tea— being described as "adulterated with china clay and plumbago," the other—a specimen of "wine"— being described as " a fictitious kind." I find no record of any proceedings having been taken against the vendors of the articles thus reported upon. In the second table—that of analyses made upon articles obtained for the purpose at the instance of the Sanitary Department of the Vestry itself—the following results will be noted:— Of black pepper, twelve specimens were obtained, all were found free from adulteration. Of white mustard, eighteen specimens were obtained, seven were found to be free from adulteration, and the remaining eleven are reported as " adulterated with turmeric and flour." Seven of the specimens thus reported upon were " sold as a mixture," and, as the added articles were not injurious, the vendors were not open to the imputation of unfair trading. The vendors of the remaining four mixed articles were " cautioned." Of bread, six specimens were obtained, in four " no adulteration was detected," the remaining two 29 are reported as having been adulterated with alum, " a trace cf alumina having been found in the ash." Of salt butter, six specimens were obtained, in them all " a large per cent. of salt and water added " is reported. Of mixed pickles, six specimens were obtained, all of which are reported as " adulterated with turmeric and sulphuric acid." Of cocoa, twelve specimens were obtained and all are reported as "adulterated" with sugar and farinaceous matter. Of confections, thirteen specimens were obtained. Eleven are reported as "not adulterated,'' one as " adulterated with wheat flour," and one as " adulterated with lime and colouring matter." Of coffee, twelve specimens were obtained. Eight were sold as pure coffee and were all found to be pure; four were " sold as a mixture," and of these three are reported as " not adulterated," while the fourth is reported as " adulterated with chicory." I can only suggest here that some vendors declared the coffee as a mixture in order to be on the safe side, finding themselves rather suddenly challenged upon the subject. Of milk, fifty-four specimens were obtained, all are reported as "not adulterated" with the exception of six specimens, two obtained in February and four in July. Water is specified as the adulterant in each case. Two of these "adulterated" specimens contained, however, 8 per cent. of cream, two contained 7 per cent., one contained 6 per cent., and one contained 5 per cent. 30 Among the specimens reported as " not adulterated," eleven are reported as impoverished by the abstraction of cream, the amount left in the milk varying from 7½ per cent. to none. In all these cases the vendor was " cautioned." In other specimens of milk, however, the report brings out some facts that should not be passed over without comment. We find that specimens were found to contain 11½, 12, 14, 22, 24½, 13, 12, 13, 12, 17, 14, 16½, 13¼, 12, and 16 parts per cent. of cream, noticing only the specimens which contained more than 11 per cent. Upon this an obvious question arises : How comes it that milk is sold in London over the counter with such extreme and abnormal amounts of cream? Two answers will suggest themselves, i.e., that some vendors knew the Vestry officers, and, suspecting their object, delivered milk that was dexterously loaded with cream in the act of measuring; or that the milk is often so carelessly retailed that the cream is unequally distributed with the milk, and that, while in some cases there was a deficiency of cream that deficiency was due not to fraudulent abstraction but to unobserved accident in the mode of distributing the milk. I have the honour to be, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS, M.D, 5, Savile Row, St. James's. 31 ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, APPENDIX TO REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH.
