Royal Commission on Water Supply- The Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the subject of the Water Supply within the limits of the Metroplitan Water Companies, referred to in last year's annual report, having asked for the views of this Board on the subject, the following statement of their views was resolved upon, viz. :— [a.)—This Board has always been and is now in favour of a Water Trust being formed for the purpose of purchasing the Metropolitan Water Companies' undertakings, and of supplying the Metropolis (or the water area included in such Companies' powers) with water. (b)—This Board was one of the public bodies who promoted in the year 1891 the Bill intituled "a Bill to place the water supply of the " Metropolis and the adjoining districts under the control of a public "authority, and to make further provision for such supply." (Bill 178). (c.)—This Board's views on the subject were embodied in a draft Bill prepared by the Executive Committee of the above-mentioned bodies, of which the representative of this Board was a member, but such draft Bill was not adopted as so prepared, and the Bill introduced into the House of Commons, though based on the same principle, differed considerably in important details from the views of the Board. 14 (d.)—In the opinion of this Board the purchase of the Water Companies' undertakings should be carried out by a Board of Arbitration, containing representatives of the parties chiefly interested, and the Board suggested and is still of opinion that such Board of Arbitration should be constituted as follows, viz.:— The President of the Local Government Board, or his nominee ; The Governor of the Bank of England, or his nominee; One person appointed by the Conservators of the river Thames; Three persons appointed by the Water Companies; Three persons appointed by the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards and the Sanitary Authorities of the districts outside the Metropolis; and that an instruction should be given to the Board of Arbitration that in settling the purchase of the Water Companies' undertakings the valuation should be based upon the value of the property to be purchased and not upon the value of the capital stock or shares of the Companies. (e.)—This Board also suggested and is still of opinion that the Water Trust should consist of thirty members, constituted as follows, viz.: — Six to be elected by the London County Council; Two to be elected by the Common Council of the City of London; One to be elected by the Conservators of the River Thames; Eleven to be elected by the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards and the Sanitary Authorities of the districts outside the Metropolis north of the Thames ; Ten to be elected by the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards and the Sanitary Authorities of the districts outside the Metropolis south of the Thames. (f.)—The election of Members of the Board of Arbitration and of the Water Trust by the Vestries and District Boards and Sanitary Authorities could be carried out in a manner similar to that provided by 18 and 19 Vict., chap. 120, sees. 45, 46, and 47, relating to the election of members of the Metropolitan Board of Works for certain combined parishes and districts therein specified. (g.)—'This Board is not in favor of the management of the water supply being given to the London County Council, believing that the Council has sufficient work on its hands in carrying out the very extensive and increasing duties which already devolve upon it under the numerous Acts of Parliament relating to the government of the County of London. The control of the water supply to so large a population, 15 and the carrying on of such an immense business "as would be formed by the amalgamation of the eight Water Companies, should in the opinion of the Board, be under a Board of Management composed of persons who possess special knowledge and experience, and such Board should be exclusively occupied in the management of the water supply. Moreover the Council does not represent the whole water area. (h.)—The Board believe that if such a Trust as is above suggested were created the water supply of London would be carried out at less cost than at present; that much waste of water would be avoided; and that many of the anomalies as to the charges for water and other matters which now exist would be abolished. The Clerk to the Board attended before the Commission and gave evidence in support of the foregoing statement. Bills in Parliament. The following Bills which have been introduced in the present Session have been considered by the Board, viz.:— 1.—Southwark and Vauxhall Water. 2.—London County Council (General Powers). 3.—London County Council (Westminster Bridge and Embank ment Tramways). 4.—London Building Act, 1894, Amendment. 5.—London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (Various Powers). 6.—City and South London Railway. 7.—Superannuation (Metropolis). 8.—Local Authorities Officers' Superannuation. 9.—School Board Elections. 10.—Street Noises. 11.—London County Council (Northern Tramways). 12.—London County Council (Acton Sewage). 13—Rivers Pollution. 14.—Metropolitan Water Companies. 15.—Plumbers Registration. Sonthwarkand Vauxhall Water Bill. The Bill mentioned in the last report was passed, but provisions were inserted binding the Company to promote a Bill this Session for similar purposes, and providing that from and after the passing of such Bill the Act of last year should be 16 London County Council (General Powers) Bill. This Bill provides, amongst other things, for the widening of York Road, Wandsworth, and the purchase of a site in Gleneagle Road, Streatham, for the purpose of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Acts ; and also contains provisions for carrying into effect the proposal to purchase land in Putney Bridge Road for an open space or public recreation ground mentioned in last year's annual report. It has, however, been found that part of this land will cost more than was anticipated. The estimated price was £31,300, but in all probability the cost, including legal and other expenses, will exceed that sum by at least £1,000. The contribution of the County Council was limited to £15,500 ; the Board promised £10,000; and the subscriptions received (including £5,000 from Dr. Longstaff, L.C.C.) amount to £5,800, making together the above-mentioned sum of £31,300. In order to secure the land the Board have undertaken to bear all the expenses of and in connection with the purchase over and above the estimated cost. The widening of the Wandsworth portion of York Road is estimated to cost £9,900, one-fourth of which sum will be paid by this Board. The Board suggested that, in addition to the improvement shown on the deposited plan, the Council should repealed, and should in no case be in force after September 1st, 1899. A Bill has accordingly been introduced by the Company this Session to empower them to acquire lands, to construct works, to take additional water from the river Thames, and to raise additional capital. The Board decided not to oppose the Bill, but they requested the London County Council, who appeared in opposition, to see that provision was made that the Bill should not have the effect of increasing the value of the Company's undertaking in the event of its purchase by a public authority. The Bill has passed the House of Commons. London County Council (Westminster Bridge and Embankment Tramways.) This Bill provided for the construction by the Council of tramways from the existing tramways at Westminster Bridge Road and Stangate, across Westminster Bridge, and along the Victoria Embankment to its eastern end. The Board did not agree with the proposal and informed the Council accordingly, and requested the members of the Council for this District to oppose the scheme. The Bill was rejected upon second reading in the House of Commons. London Building Act, 1891 Amendment. This Bill provided, amongst other things, for the amendment of the provisions of the London Building Act, 1894, with respect to the erection or extension of buildings, and the formation or extension of forecourts in front of buildings, within the prescribed distance from the centre of the street. The Board suggested an alteration in the clause relating to the foregoing provision with the object of more effectually securing the setting back of forecourt fences. The Council, however, in view of the provisions of the present Act, could not see their way to adopt the suggestion. L.B. & S C. Rly. (Various Powers.) This Bill provides for the widening of the Croydon and Balham line from a point a furlong-and-a-half north of Streatham Common Station to the boundary of the Parishes of Streatham and Croydon, and the Board opposed the scheme with the view of obtaining the insertion of clauses to protect the c 17 arrange for the widening of York Road opposite the Princess of Wales' public-house, and the Council have intimated that they will endea'vour to arrange for this to be done when the work is being carried out. The proposed purchase of land in Gleneagle Road will not be proceeded with as the Council have purchased a suitable site for a fire station elsewhere. 18 interests of the District. When the Bill came before the Committee of the House of Commons clauses were agreed with the promote'rs with respect to the widening of the Greyhound Lane bridge and the approaches thereto, and as to interference with the Board's sewers. A clause was also agreed with the promoters and the trustees of the Crooke Ellison estate and of the Du Cane estate respecting the widening of the bridge between Greyhound Lane and the parish boundary, to the effect that the sum of £1,500 shall be paid to the Board towards the cost of such widening, and land is to be given up by the Company in order to form a road which will provide a means of communication between the two sides of the railway. The Board also endeavoured to secure the insertion in the Bill of a provision that until the new railway shall come into rating the general,sewers, and lighting rates shall be paid in respect of 44 houses which are within the limits of deviation, but the Committee decided that there were not sufficient special circumstances in the case to justify them in extending the general rule of law. City and South London Railway. This Bill provides for the construction of sidings from the terminus of the authorised line in High Street, Clapham, along Clapham Common South Side, to a point opposite the junction of roads leading to Wandsworth and Old Town. The promoters having agreed to insert in the Bill the clauses which the Board thought necessary for the protection of the interests of the District, the opposition to the Bill was withdrawn. SuDerannuation (Metropolis) This Bill applies only to the officers of Vestries and District Boards and other parochial bodies included in the provisions of the Metropolis Superannuation Act of 1866. The Act of 1866 gives to such officers superannuation allowances subject to the discretion of the Vestry or District Board under 19 whom they serve, and the Bill now before Parliament provides that the officers shall exchange this equitable claim for an absolute right (subject to good conduct and other conditions) to superannuation, and that in consideration thereof they shall contribute a per-centage of their salaries to the rates from which they are paid. The Board presented a petition in favour of the Bill. Local Authorities Officers Superannuation. This Bill would apply to the whole of England, and includes teachers and officers of School Boards, officers of County Councils, Borough Corporations, &c. These bodies have at present no power to grant superannuation allowances. The Board petitioned against the Bill. School Board Elections. This Bill, which has been introduced by Sir Blundell Maple, provides that for the purpose of the next triennial election of Members and of all subsequent elections of Members of the School Board for London ever)' undivided Parliamentary Borough in the Metropolis, and every division of every divided Parliamentary Borough in the Metropolis, shall be a Division entitled to return one Member of the School Board for London, except that the City of London shall be entitled to return two Members. The Bill would, therefore, abolish the cumulative system of voting now in force at School Board Elections. In view of the large area, population, and rateable value of the Borough of Wandsworth, compared with other Boroughs and Divisions which would return a Member of the School Board, the following petition was presented to Parliament by the Board for an alteration of the Bill so as to give the Borough two Members, viz.:— To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Sheweth :- Wandsworth District, under their Common Seal. i.—That your Petitioners are the Local Authority, constituted unc 2 20 der the Metropolis Management Acts, for the District of Wandsworth, which comprises the parishes of Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting Graveney, and Wandsworth, having an area of over fourteen-and-a-half square miles, a population of about 202,000, and a rateable value of £1,311,416. 2.—That the Precepts of the School Board for London for the Wandsworth District are served upon your Petitioners, and the amounts of such Precepts raised by your Petitioners and paid by them into the School Board Fund. 3.—That a Bill (hereinafter referred to as "the Bill") has been introduced into your Honourable House, intituled "A Bill to alter the "Divisions of London for the Election of the School Board and thereby "abolish the Cumulative Vote." 4.—That the fourth clause of the Bill provides that for the purpose of the next triennial election of Members and of all subsequent elections of Members of the School Board for London every undivided Parliamentary Borough in the Metropolis, and every division of every divided Parliamentary Borough in the Metropolis, shall be a Division entitled to return one Member of the School Board for London, except that the City of London shall be entitled to return two Members. 5.—Your Petitioners are of opinion that many of the existing School Board Electoral Divisions are too large; and this is especially the case with regard to the West Lambeth Division, of which your Petitioners' District forms part. Such extensive areas for electoral purposes are in all respects disadvantageous, inasmuch as Members are not so accessible nor so well known to their constituents, and it is difficult for them to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the requirements of their District. The expense of contesting these large constituencies also throws a heavy and unnecessary burden upon candidates. 6.—Your Petitioners are further of opinion that the cumulative system of voting now in force at the School Board Elections ought to be abolished, as it results in the election of candidates who obtain the support of fewer voters than some of the unsuccessful candidates obtain. 7.—The provisions of the Bill, if carried into effect, will to some extent remedy the above mentioned defects of the law which now regulates the election of Members of the School Board for London, but they will not meet the justice of the case so far as regards your Petitioners' District. 8.—-The Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth comprises that part of your Petitioners' District which consists of the parishes of 21 Putney, Streatham, Tooting Graveney, and Wandsworth. Should the Bill be passed in its present form, only one Member of the School Board would be returned by that Borough. 9.—Your Petitioners suggest that the said Borough of Wandsworth should be formed either into two undivided Boroughs or into two Divisions, each returning one Member of the School Board; that one of such Boroughs or Divisions should comprise the parishes of Putney and Wandsworth, and that the other should comprise the par shes of Streatham and Tooting Graveney. The parishes of Putney and Wandsworth combined have a population of 78,667 (census 1896), a rateable value of £530,459, and 12,612 registered parochial electors. The parishes of Streatham and Tooting Graveney combined have a population of 61,644 (census 1896), a rateable value of £475,448, and 9,940 registered parochial electors. 10.—In support of this suggestion your Petitioners humbly point out that the first of the Boroughs or Divisions above suggested, namely the combined parishes of Putney and Wandsworth, has a greater population than 35 of the 56 Boroughs or Divisions (excluding the Borough of Wandsworth) in the Metropolis, each of which would, under the provisions of the Bill, return one Member of the School Board; also a greater rateable value than 37 of such Boroughs or Divisions, and a greater number of registered parochial electors than 34 of such Boroughs or Divisions. The second of the Boroughs or Divisions above suggested, namely the combined parishes of Streatham and Tooting Graveney, has a greater population than 13 of such 56 Boroughs or Divisions; a greater rateable value than 33 of such Boroughs or Divisions, and a greater number of registered parochial electors than 21 of such Boroughs or Divisions. [In the foregoing statistics the City of London, which under the Bill would return two Members of the School Board, is excluded, and the average rateable value of the Divisions of a Borough is taken in those cases where the 1 ateable value of the Divisions of such Borough is not shown separately in the published Returns.] II.—That your Petitioners' District has a large area in proportion to its population and rateable value. Much of this area is still unbuilt upon. Very extensive building operations are going on throughout the District. The population of the four above-mentioned parishes of Putney, Wandsworth, Streatham, and Tooting Graveney increased from 113,233 to 140,311 in the five years 1891 to 1896. This rate of increase is, your Petitioners believe, being more than maintained. The greater part of the Metroplis is already built upon, and it necessarily follows that the number of Boroughs or Divisions with a less population and rateable value than either of the two Boroughs or Divisions which 22 your Petitioners respectfully submit should be formed out of the present Borough of Wandsworth will increase, and the injustice to your Petitioners' District become greater, from year to year. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Bill may be amended by providing that the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth be formed either into two undivided Boroughs or into two Divisions, each returning one Member of the School Board for London, as hereinbefore suggested. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. The Bill has not yet been read a second time. Street Noises. This Bill would empower occupiers or lodgers to require itinerant musicians or singers to desist from playing or singing in any public place near his house or premises, under a penalty of forty shillings or imprisonment for a period not exceeding fourteen days. The Board have presented a petition in favour of the Bill. The Board decided to take no action with regard to the other Bills above mentioned. Local Government of the Metropolis. It was announced in the Queen's speech at the opening of Parliament this Session, that a measure for facilitating the creation of municipalities in the Administrative County of London would be brought forward; but on the 10th of June the First Lord of the Treasury stated that it would not be introduced, and that it would be brought forward by the Government early next Session. The Board have had under consideration and decided to concur in a resolution passed by the Lee District Board of Works in favor of new Local Authorities being constituted with Councils and Mayors for all the existing areas of the Metropolis; and of steps being taken to carry out the recommendations for transfer of powers from the London County Council to Local Authorities, as adopted by 23 the Conference of representatives of the County Council and the Local Authorities which met at Spring Gardens in 1896. Costermongers. The subject of the obstruction caused in the Balham High Road by costermongers has continued to receive the consideration of the Board. A deputation from the Balham Ratepayers' Association attended before the Board, and suggested that their Solicitor should act in conjunction with the Board's Solicitor in the prosecution of the costermongers. The Board were of opinion that this was impracticable, but at the hearing of one of the summonses afterwards taken out by the Board the Association's Solicitor was present and addressed the Magistrate on the subject of the obstruction and annoyance of which the Association complained. The Board have also been again in communication with the Commissioner of Police, and have urged that the costermongers created an obstruction to the traffic and were an annoyance to the inhabitants, and requested that the police might be directed to remove them, under the provisions of No. 6 of the Police Regulations for costermongers. The Commissioner of Police stated in reply that the obstruction was not such as to justify the police in taking proceedings, that the number of costermongers standing in Balham High Road was diminishing owing to the action of the Board, and that the police thought that if such action were continued it would result in putting an end to the complaint, and that there did not appear to be any specific infringement of the regulations such as would justify the police in taking action. The Board therefore continued their action. 481 summonses have been issued. In 163 cases the offenders were fined small sums, and in 41 cases were ordered to pay costs only, the remaining summonses being chiefly not served owing to false addresses. The 24 obstruction had been to some extent abated, when some summonses were issued by tradesmen in an adjoining parish against costermongers who stood in front of their shops. These cases came before the same Magistrate, and after hearing counsel on behalf of the costermongers and taking time to consider his judgment, the summonses were dismissed. At the hearing of the next of the Board's summonses, the Magistrate stated that he had come to the conclusion that in view of the police regulations he had no power to inflict a penalty on costermongers for obstructing the public way and he dismissed the summons, although he found as a fact that the defendant caused an obstruction and was an annoyance to the inhabitants. The Magistrate at the same time expressed his willingness to state a case for appeal, and the necessary steps are being taken by the Board to bring the matter before the High Court. Combined Drainage. This subject still continues to receive the attention of the Vestries and District Boards. The opposition to the Bill of last Session was again successful in preventing the second reading being reached. A draft Bill has been prepared and adopted by the Conference of representatives of Vestries and District Boards, and the London County Council and the Metropolitan Members of Parliament have been requested to support it. The Council have expressed their willingness to introduce the Bill, but have requested the Conference to obtain the names of Members who are willing to take charge of it in the House of Commons. The Conference are in communication with Members on the subject with the view of this being done. Ventilation of Sewers. A Conference of the Surveyors of the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis was convened by the Engineer of the London 25 County Council in February last to consider this question. This Board was represented by their several Surveyors, and the following resolutions were passed by the Conference, viz.:— 1.—That the closing of sewer ventilators in response to complaints increases the general evil, the diminution of which is to be attained by the multiplication of the ventilators at regular frequent intervals. 2.—That in connection with any interceptor hereafter fixed on a main house drain it is advisable to carry up a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor, up the front, side, or back of the house, to the satisfaction of the local sanitary authority, and that the outlet drain from the the interceptor shall not be flap-trapped in sewer, unless required by the local sanitary authority. 3.—That pipe ventilators up buildings, or otherwise where possible, should always be adopted, in addition to surface ventilation. It is the practice of the Board to erect pipe ventilators against buildings as opportunities occur. Telephone Service. The Corporation of London having made an application for an enquiry into the cost and efficiency of the telephone service in London invited the Board to appoint delegates to attend a conference on the subject. Messrs. Kimber, Ridley, and Lidiard were appointed to represent the Board at the Conference, which was held on the 17th March. The following resolutions were passed, viz.:— "That in the opinion of this Conference of Delegates representing the Corporation of London and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, the present telephone service of London is inadequate, inefficient, and costly." "That in the opinion of this Conference an enquiry should be held by the Treasury as to the cost, adequacy, and efficiency of the London telephone service, and all matters relating thereto, agreeably to the request of the Local Authorities of London." "That inasmuch as the National Telephone Company is not possessed of statutory powers for placing mains, pipes, or wires underneath the streets of the Metropolis, it is undesirable that Local 26 Authorities should give the Company permission to lay mains until the interests of the public are duly secured by statute, as in the case of tramways and electric lighting undertakings, and subject always to the previous consent of the road authority." "That this meeting of Metropolitan Delegates expresses its entire approval of the City Corporation's action on the telephone question, and also its thanks for the convening of this Conference." A select Committee of the House of Commons has been appointed to enquire and report whether the telephone service is calculated to become of such general benefit as to justify its being undertaken by municipal and other local authorities, and upon other points in connection with the subject. A Conference has been convened by the London County Council (at which Messrs. Kimber and Ridley will represent the Board) to consider as to giving evidence before the Committee. Land Transfer. The Privy Council having proposed to apply to the County of London part 3 of this Act, which provides for the compulsory registration of title of property, the London County Council, who have power to veto the proposal, asked for the views of the Board and other local authorities on the subject. The Board were of opinion that the compulsory registration of title would not be desirable in the County of London and they informed the London County Council accordingly. Twelve of the local authorities in London were in favour of the proposal and 21 against it. The London County Council were informed by the Privy Council that the intention was that the order should be made to take effect progressively by dividing the County into convenient areas not less than four in number; and the Council decided, by a majority of 72 to 35, not to veto the proposal, and informed the Privy Council that it relied on the order being so framed that it should be made to take effect according to the before-mentioned terms. 27 Proposed Lock and Weir on the Thames. As stated in last year's report the Board retained a firm of civil engineers to report to them on this subject. The sites suggested by the engineers for the construction of the proposed lock and weir were:—above the river Wandle from the osier beds on the southern side of the I hames to a point near Broomhouse Dock on the northern side, or slightly to the west of that site between the proposed new recreation ground in Putney Bridge Road and the grounds of Hurlingham House,—or a more advantageous position below the Wandle from the site of the steamboat pier at the end of Jews Row on the southern side to Corrison Wharf on the northern side. The Board also considered the report by the engineer retained by the Thames (Western) Improvement Committee on the subject, which suggested the construction of a lock and weir from Broomhouse Dock Lane on the northern side to land on the southern side west of the mouth of the river Wandle. A supplemental report was made by the same engineer in which he stated that a better site than the one he originally suggested would be from the northern side of the river near the wharf belonging to the Fulham Vestry to York Place, York Road, Battersea, on the southern side. The Board were also invited to appoint representatives on the Thames (Western) Improvement Committee, but after fully considering the subject they passed the following resolution, viz.:— "That in the opinion of this Board the question of the erection of a bridge, lock, and weir at Wandsworth, or lower down the river Thames, for the purpose of impounding water at ebb tides sufficient to enable the business and pleasure traffic on the river to be carried on, should be dealt with by the London County Council, and that the expense thereof so far as regards the metropolis, should be borne by the County of London; that holding this opinion this Board cannot agree to appoint members of a Committee whose object is to make an application to Parliament for power to erect the proposed bridge, lock, and weir, the Board believing that such application by the Committee would not be successful;" 28 The Committee above mentioned are now in communication with the respective County Councils on the subject. Thames Steamboat Passenger Service. The Board have had under consideration the subject of the inconvenience arising from the irregularity of the Thames Steamboat passenger service. The Fivers Committee of the London County Council made the following recommendation, viz.:—"That it is desirable that powers be sought to enable the Council to make arrangements with the Thames Conservancy Board and others for providing and working free steamboat piers within the area of the County of London, and to expend money in connection therewith and in the improvement of the approaches thereto;" and the Board passed and forwarded to the Council a resolution in support of such recommendation. Bye-laws re Lamps, Signs, &c. The Board have had under consideration draft bye-laws proposed to be made by the London County Council, under section 104 of the London Building Act, 1894, for the regulation of lamps, signs, and other structures overhanging the public way, not being within the City. The Board suggested several amendments to the proposed byelaws and the subject is under the consideration of the London County Council. Proposed Site for Board School at Broomhill Road The School Board for London again scheduled for the erection of a school the site in Broomhill Road to which reference was made in the last two reports. The Board being of opinion that the objections which they had previously urged still existed, requested the Education Department to withhold their consent to the proposed site, but the Department have decided that it is not a 29 case in which they would be justified in interfering with the discretion of the School Board. Proposed Site for Board School Totterdown. The School Board for London having scheduled a site for a Board School at Totterdown, Tooting, the Board objected thereto, as it would interfere with the continuation of a road and a large number of the children would have to cross the High Road near the tramway terminus ; and they suggested that a site should be obtained near the end of Vant Road. The School Board have now abandoned the proposal and have decided to acquire a site at Vant Road. Traction Engines. The Board have had under consideration the subject of the use of traction engines. They were of opinion that such engines caused danger to property and annoyance and disturbed residents whose houses abutted on the roads through which they passed. The Board informed the London County Council accordingly, and also that they approved of powers being obtained by the Council to restrict the number of trucks which may be drawn by one engine and the weight of the load. Her Majesty's Jubilee The following address to the Queen on the completion of the sixtieth year of Her Majesty's reign was forwarded for presentation, and the Board were afterwards informed by the Home Secretary that it had been graciously received:— "To Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen. "We, the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, desire to "convey to your Majesty the expression of our humble and loyal duty, "and the pleasure with which we, in common with all your Majesty's "subjects, regard the completion of the sixtieth year of your Majesty's "reign. During that long and eventful period unexampled progress has "been made in the development of commerce and science, and in the "promotion of the comfort and prosperity of the people of this Empire 30 "and in no direction has this advance been more marked than in the "administration of the laws relating to the health of the community. "We gratefully acknowledge the constant personal interest which is "taken by your Majesty in the welfare of all classes, and the beneficent "example set by the Throne in both public and private life, and it is our "earnest hope that your Majesty may long continue to enjoy the blessings "of health and happiness and to reign over a loyal, united, and devoted "people." Princess of Wales' Fund. This fund, which was raised at the Mansion House for the purpose of providing a meal for the poor on the occasion of H.M. Jubilee, was administered in this District by the Board. The members of the Board for the several parishes were appointed Local Committees, with power to add to their number, and they obtained the co-operation of ladies and gentlemen who were interested in the movement. The number of persons who would be likely to participate in the fund was estimated at 9,850. A sum of £985 was allotted to the District by the Mansion House Committee, consisting of the Lord Mayor and the Chairmen of the various Local Authorities in the Metropolis, and in addition the Board received a quantity ot tinned meat, condensed milk, and golden syrup. In two Parishes a public dinner was given on the 24th June, and tickets for meat, groceries, &c., were distributed to persons selected by the several Committees, and in some cases the goods were distributed either at the recipients' homes or from a central station. The total number of persons who participated in the fund in this District was 12,375. The statement of receipts and expenditure showed a balance unexpended of £66 6s. 4d. This sum was returned to the Lord Mayor to meet deficits in other Districts. Death of Members. It is with regret that the Board have to record the death of Mr. A. Thorn, who was for nine years a member for the parish of Putney, and 31 of Mr. S. F. Bailey, who was for five years a member for the parish of Streatham. Chairman of the Board. At the first Meeting of the Board after the election of Members in June, 1898, Mr. William Hewett was elected Chairman for the year. Mr. Benjamin Weir, who had been annually re-elected to that office since the passing of the Local Government Act, 1894, resigned his membership of the Board in May, 1898, in consequence of ill-health. The Board unanimously passed a resolution expressing their regret at the resignation of Mr. Weir, and referred to a Committee the subject of suitably recognising his services to the Board and to the District for the long period of 24 years. 32 APPORTIONMENTS.

Sanitary Department REPORT ON THE Health and Sanitary Condition OF THE SEVERAL PARISHES COMPRISED IN THE WANDSWORTH DISTRICT DURING THE YEAR 1897 BY THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE Report of the Public Analyst. To the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District. Gentlemen, We have the honour to present our Annual Report on the Health, Sanitary Condition, and Vital Statistics of the Wandsworth District, for the year 1897. We may congratulate you on the healthiness of the District, as shown in the report, both by the lowness of the death-rate and the small amount of fatal preventible disease. As the area of the District is more and more filled up by buildings, we expect these figures to become higher from increased density of population, so that it is satisfactory to find that, on the contrary, they have tended to decrease in the last two years. You will also find evidence in the report of the very large amount of sanitary work that has been carried out in the year, work which tends yearly to increase in extent and importance. We have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH for the Wandsworth District. B 2 REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT. The population, estimated to the middle of was 195,974, and was made up as shown in the following table, which also gives the population at the last three census. Census, 1881. Census, 1891. Census, 1896.

The total number registered during the year was 5,042, of which 2,558 were males and 2,484 females. They were distributed in the sub-districts as shown in the following table, which also gives the birth-rate and the rate of natural increase. 6 Medical Officen of Health Annual Report. TABLE I.

The mean rate for the last ten years was 27.29, so that the rate is much below the average. A glance at Table III. shows the steady fall that the birth-rate has undergone in the decade, from a maximum of 30.4 in 1887. There is seen to be a great variation in the rate in the different sub-districts, Wandsworth having the highest, 31.77, and Streatham the lowest, 22.8. The birth-rate for the Metropolis, in 1897, was 30.0, the lowest on record. The natural increase of the population, or the excess of births over deaths, was 2,440, giving a rate of 12.5 per thousand living, which is higher than in the two previous years. Deaths. The total number registered was 2,602, consisting of 1,263 males and 1,339 females. In the previous year there were 2,736 deaths. This total includes 514 deaths of persons not belonging to the District, but who died therein, and does not include the 525 deaths in out-lying institutions shown in Table IV. The corrected total is, therefore, 2,613; the crude death-rate is 13.27, and the corrected rate 13.22. The following 7 District. Table shows the distribution in the sub-districts, and the death-rates, corrected and uncorrected in each. TABLE II. DEATHS. Uncorrected Death-rate. Corrected Death-rate Sub-Districts. Males.

The death-rate from these diseases per 1,000 living was 2.23, and was, with the exception of 1895, the lowest since 1889. The following Table gives the zymotic rate in the sub-districts and in the entire district for the last ten years. It is seen that the rate varied last year from 2.8 in Wandsworth to 0.26 in Tooting. 13 District.

The chart on the next page shows the number of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever cases notified in each month of the year. small-pox. There were two cases reported during the year, one of which was contracted outside the District. There was no death. There has been no serious recrudescence of the disease since the epidemic of 1895, but the comparative neglect of vaccination, to which reference will be made later, renders the danger of it greater year by year. There were 26 deaths in the year, or one less scarlet Fever. than in 1896 The notifications were 1,014, a larger number than in any of the last four years, and exceeded only in 1893 of all the years since notification was compulsory. The mild nature of the fever is shown 15 District. by the proportionate number of deaths, which give a rate of 2.5 per hundred cases; whereas in 1893, when also there was a considerable epidemic, the rate was 4.0. The feature of the Scarlet Fever of last year, besides its mildness, was its more even distribution throughout the year, varying only from a minimum of 57 cases in June to a maximum of 113 in November. There were 95 cases in the first month of the year and 94 in the last. The difficulty as to hospital accommodation, to which we referred in our last report, was largely overcome in 1897, the new buildings opened by the Metropolitan Asylums Board having proved sufficient to relieve the pressure to a large extent. There was not an entire absence of delay in effecting the removal of patients, but it was much less than in 1896. Of the total cases, 660 were removed to hospital, or 65 percent., a higher percentage than we have had in any year previously; last year the figure was 55.5 per cent. The deaths at their homes were 7, and at the hospitals 19, the percentage mortality being 1.9 and 2.8 respectively. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. There were 569 cases of Diphtheria and 7 of Membranous Croup reported during the year. This is considerably in excess of the number in any year since notification has been in force. As is seen by looking at Table IX., the greatest proportion occurred in the subdistricts of Streatham and Wandsworth, and in the reports for those parishes reference will be found to the great influence schools have had in spreading it. The deaths were, from Diphtheria, 103, and from Membranous Croup, 3. These are the highest figures on record, except in 1893, when the deaths were 116 (99 from Diphtheria and 17 from Membranous Croup), and exceed the corrected decennial average by 42. These should be taken together, as there is every reason to believe that they are essentially the same disease, and only differ in the locality affected. The case mortality works out at 16 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. 18.4 per cent., which is higher than in the two preceding years, when there was comparatively little prevalence of Diphtheria, and much lower than in 1893 and 1894, both epidemic years, with case mortalities of 24.5 and 25.3 respectively. Therefore, though there was a great deal of the disease present during the year, it was of a distinctly milder type than it has been in former epidemics. The death-rate per thousand living was 0.57, in Battersea it was 0.63, in Lambeth, 0.48; and in the whole of London, 0.50; so that this District has, unfortunately, experienced proportionately an undue mortality from Diphtheria in 1897. Enteric Fever. The number of deaths from this cause was 16 only, one less than in the previous year, and less than in any year since 1892. The number of notifications was 100, however, two more than last year but also less than the three previous years. There were also 5 notifications of Continued Fever with 1 death, and these are in all probability the same disease. The deathrate per thousand living was 0.08, whilst for the whole of London it was 0.13. The lowness of the mortality from this cause is a matter of satisfaction, as there is not uncommonly an association of it with sanitary defects. Puerperal Fever. There were 5 deaths from this cause, one more than in the previous year, but less than the average for the last ten years. The number notified was 9, also less than the average. It is somewhat striking to notice the large proportion of deaths to cases notified; it seems to show, what is probably the case, that only a somewhat small proportion of the cases of Puerperal Fever that occur are reported; this is perhaps natural, and it is not easy to suggest any means of bringing about a more complete compliance with the law in this respect. 17 District. Erysipelas. The notifications were 238, or a decrease on last year. The deaths were 4, the smallest number in the ten years. Measles. This was not an epidemic year for this disease, for only 28 deaths were attributed to it. As compared with 154 deaths in 1896, there has been a great saving of life from this cause, but this cannot be set down to any special action on the part of sanitary officials, but simply to the natural history of Measles. So large a proportion of the children suffered from it in 1896 that there was but little available material for it to spread by in 1897. In spite of this fact, it will be noticed that there were more deaths from Measles than from Scarlet Fever, and this furnishes a reason for greater efforts being made to check the spread of it. It is a common, but most unfortunate, article of belief with many people that all children are of necessity obliged to have an attack of Measles, and that, when they have it, it is likely to be a trivial matter. This naturally leads to much carelessness and even wanton exposure of children to the infection. Anything that could be done to disabuse the public of these ideas would be in the right direction, and we therefore think that the recent proposal to apply the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act relating to ''dangerous infectious diseases" to Measles would be of some possible advantage. Whooping Cough. There were 41 deaths from this cause, as in the case of Measles, an enormous fall from the previous year. These zymotic illnesses are nearly always associated with each other in epidemics, and the above remarks apply equally to Whooping Cough. Influenza. There were 49 deaths, as against 37 in the previous year. Excepting for 1896 the deaths were fewer than in any year since this malady has been epidemic, c 18 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Dlarrhœa. There were 162 deaths referred to this cause, a larger number than in any of the last ten years, and exceeding the annual average, corrected for increase of population, by 62. Most of the deaths occurred in the third quarter of the year, and the excessive prevalence of Diarrhœa was associated, as usual, with a warm, dry summer. Deaths from Nun-Zymotic Diseases.

Gout and Rheumatism The deaths from these causes were less than the average, with also a decrease from last year of 5. District. 19 Cancer and other Tumours. There were exactly the same number of deaths as last year, but they were 5 above the average. While it is not improbable that there has been an increase of Cancer, it must be noted that part of this apparent increase is due to the deaths that have occurred in institutions, and really belong to other parts of London and the country. These deaths are all included in the Table. Tubercular Diseases. The deaths from this group of diseases, which includes Consumption, were 276, a larger number actually than in any year of the decade, but less than the average by 25. Here again the figures are affected by deaths of outside persons, as Cancer and Tubercular Diseases form a large proportion of the deaths in institutions. Reduction in the number of deaths in this group is important, because of the relationship between them and general sanitary conditions, such as overcrowding and dirtiness. The Phthisis death-rate is sometimes taken as an index of the healthiness or otherwise of a district. The corrected rate for the District was 1.14 per thousand living, whilst that for the Metropolis was 1.71, and the adjacent parishes of Battersea and Lambeth 1.49 and 1.67 respectively. Diseases of the Nervous System. Though there was an increase on the previous year, there was a saving of 78 on the corrected average. Diseases of the Organs of Circulation. On the other hand, the deaths in this group are in excess of the average by 43. A general tendency of these deaths to increase is seen from the Table, those in the earlier years of the decade being somewhat markedly less than those of the later. Respiratory Diseases. The deaths from lung diseases were few, 355, and show a substantial saving of 145 on the average; they, of course, are not inclusive of Phthisis, c 2 20 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. There was no great departure from the average in the remaining groups of causes of death, but those from diseases of the digestive organs were 15, and those from violence were 11, below the corrected average. Taking the Table as a whole, it is seen that 222 more persons would have died during the year if the same rate of mortality had been maintained as in the preceding ten years. District. 21 TABLE X.

This gives a percentage on the total births of 17.6, the highest figure we have had in this District. The progress of vaccination in the last ten years may be seen from the following figures, which 23 District. give the percentage on births, of the children not accounted for in the vaccination returns:— 1886 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 6.6 10.0 6.4 6.4 6.8 8.6 11.3 10.8 13.4 13.3 17.6 This shows that since the year 1891 there has been a great falling off in the amount of vaccination done, and that the last year is the worst of the series. It is thought by many that the Bill to amend the Vaccination Acts recently introduced by the Government will not at all prevent this growing tendency to avoid vaccination, which, of course, is seen all over London. The extension of the age limit to twelve months will, at all events, make the work of the vaccination officer almost an impossibility in London, where there is so much migration of the working classes from one district to another. If in three months over 17 per cent, are lost sight of, how many will be lost sight of in twelve months ? Without minimising the advantages that are expected to be obtained from this age extension, in the way of overcoming the opposition of mothers to the operation, this aspect of the question is a very important one in all large towns. In spite of this, there does not seem much prospect of the measure lessening the opposition to vaccination by the professed agitators. It seems, therefore, probable that we shall have to face the fact that we shall have, year by year, an increasing proportion of children unprotected by vaccination, and experience has shown that the higher that proportion becomes, the more danger there is of Small Pox epidemics, affecting then, not only the unvaccinated, but also the imperfectly vaccinated, and those whose original vaccination has worn off. More responsibility will therefore devolve on the sanitary officials in dealing promptly with isolated cases of Small Pox as they arise, and, by prompt removal to isolation hospitals, prevent the inception of epidemics. We in London are fortunate in having, in 24 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. the excellently equipped hospitals and ambulance system of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, ready means of dealing with such cases. water supply. The report of Sir Edward Frankland for the year 1897 shows that, on the whole, the water supplied to London from the Thames was of very good quality, both chemically and bacterially, the condition of the Thames itself being favourable, except during the first three months of the year, when it was in high flood. He also shows the very great improvement effected in the water, both as regards its chemical composition and the number of microscopic organisms in it, by filtration through sand as practised by the companies. Whilst commending highly the general efficiency of the filtration, he finds occasionally that the filters fail to work properly. Thus, in commenting on the table showing the number of micro-organisms per cubic centimetre in water derived from various filters of the Southwark and Yauxhall Company, he remarks:—"It shows several cases in which effective bacterial filtration was not attained. Thus filters Nos. 1 and 2 were not working satisfactorily in January, No. 3 in July and December, Nos. 4 and 6 in February and No. 4 in March, No. 5 in April and May, No. 7 in March, and No 8 in September; whilst the general supply of filtered water from Hampton infringed the standard of 100 microbes per cubic centimetre in June. Although the water sent out by this company was invariably clear and bright, thus complying with the Parliamentary standard of efficient filtration, it infringed the bacterial standard in 14 out of 30 samples examined." This seems a high proportion of failures, and, considering the small number of samples that can by any possibility be examined, it suggests that a great deal of the water supplied by this Company has more than the 25 District. recognised number of micro-organisms in it. It is hardly a sufficient answer to the objections so frequently made to rivers as a source of potable water to say that, in a certain number of examinations, the standard number of microbes was not infringed ; for, as a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, so, if at any time an excess of organisms pass the filters and if there happen to be dangerous germs among them, illness may be then caused, even if the water is at most times innocuous. With regard to the Lambeth Company, Sir Edward Frankland, says :—" Excepting in February and March, this Company delivered water of excellent bacterial quality. Altogether, the record is very good, and is free from violent fluctuations. It would be still further improved by moi*e storage, for sometimes the filters have to be fed with water containing as many as 46,400 microbes per cubic centimetre." To get water in as pure a condition as possible into dwelling houses, and to minimise the danger of subsequent pollution, it is obviously most desirable that there should be a constant service, and that water should be drawn directly from the main and not from storage cisterns, so it is satisfactory that the Companies are steadily, if somewhat slowly, extending the area of constant service in the district. In connection with the water supply, it should be noted, that in November, specimens of young horseleeches were found in the water drawn through the taps of two houses in this District, on almost the same dates. In spite of the most careful investigation, both by the officials of the Lambeth Company and by ourselves, no explanation could be given as to how they came there. The domestic cisterns, from which the water came, were 26 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. clean, and it does not seem possible to suppose that the ova of the leech could find their way through the filter bed, nor that any of the water could be delivered without passing through the filter.

Sanitary Operations. The Table at the end of this Report shows that a very large number of houses and premises have been inspected during the year. A certain number of these have been inspected as the result of complaints on the part of the occupiers, but a considerable number have been visited in the course of systematic house to-house inspection. This systematic inspection has always been an important part of the sanitary work in this District, and, whilst mainly directed to the streets occupied by the poorer classes where most nuisances are met with, is intended, at longer or shorter intervals, to embrace the whole area of the District. The Inspectors engaged in this work are provided with registers containing columns for entering the results of their observations as to the number of occupants and overcrowding, cleanliness of the different rooms and passages, condition of cisterns, waterclosets, rain-water and waste-pipes and other fittings, state of the house as to dryness and the drainage. No elaborate testing of the drainage is undertaken unless there is complaint made of bad smells or there appears to the Inspector any special reason. Thus, it is seen, most valuable work in the detecting and abating of nuisances is accomplished, and records, which have year by year become more complete and useful, have been accumulated, of the sanitary condition of the whole District. It is with great regret that we find that during the last few years less of this systematic inspection has been carried out, and, indeed, in some parishes it has been almost entirely in abeyance, and this has been due to the enormous increase of the work in other directions. Most careful attention, and quite rightly, has been given to the supervision of the construction of the drains of new houses, and this has entailed a very great deal of work on the Inspectors who have often to visit daily for weeks together a drain under construction. It is consequently in those parts of the District where most building is going on, that there has 29 District. been the greatest difficulty in carrying on house-to-house inspections. The importance of the matter is such, in our opinion, as to demand the most careful attention on the part of your Board. TABLE XIII.

Population. The population, estimated in the usual way, that is by assuming that the rate of increase since the last census has been the same as in the previous intercensal period, was in the middle of 1897, 47,804; an increase of 682 in the year. Births and Birth-Rate. There were registered during the year 1,164 births, of which 590 were males, and 574 females. This is a larger number than in any year of the decade, with the exception of 1895. The birth-rate was 24.35, and the rate of natural increase, calculated from the excess of births over deaths, was 10.32. Deaths and Death-Rate. The number of deaths registered during the year in the sub-district was 607, of which 278 were of males, and 329 of females. Of these deaths, however, 39 were of non-parishioners, and occurred in the Home for the Dying and in Nursing Homes; but, in addition, there were 110 deaths of parishioners that occurred in outlying institutions, such as the Union Infirmary and the Metropolitan Hospitals. The net total of deaths is therefore 678, and the corrected death-rate calculated from this figure is 14-03, compared with 14.94 in 1896, and 15.3 in 1895. The uncorrected death-rate was 12.69. 33 Parish of Clapham. The following table gives the births, deaths, and rates corrected and uncorrected for the last ten years:— TABLE I. Birth and Death Rates.

The total number of deaths from Zymotic diseases was 113, the smallest number since 1891. The Zymotic death-rate, 2.36, was also very low, and was less than in any year since 1891; the fall from 1896 being considerable. This has chiefly been made up by the saving in deaths from Measles and Whooping Cough, but it is seen there has been a compensating increase in the deaths from Diphtheria and Diarrhoea. The following table gives the notifications of infectious diseases received under the Public Health (London) Act, and the number removed to hospital, with the number of deaths among those removed and not removed.

There has been no case of this disease notified, making the second year in which there has been complete absence of it. Searlet Fever. There were 199 cases notified during the year, compared with 221 in the previous 40 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. year, a slight fall therefore, The comparatively mild character of the type of fever we have had is shown by the fact that there have been only six deaths from it, exactly the same as in last year. The relationship of deaths to cases has shown the same low proportion during the last six years. The number notified in each month was as follows:— January 30. July 18. February 19. August 15. March 19. September 14. April 12. October 22. May 7. November 16. June 9. December 18. The largest number was in January, the remains of the autumn epidemic in 1896, and the next largest was in October. The fact that year after year there occurs this somewhat considerable number of cases of Scarlet Fever, in spite of the precautions taken to prevent it, is a matter of some disappointment; but it must be remembered that the very mildness of the disease makes prevention more difficult, because there will always be a certain number of cases unrecognised by those in charge of them, who do not therefore seek medical advice. There are, also, a certain number wilfully concealed in order to avoid the restrictions involved. These it is very difficult to deal with, as it is generally almost impossible to prove that there was knowledge of the nature of the illness. An amendment of the law, throwing on those in charge of children suffering from infectious disease the onus of proving that they did not know what was the matter, would be very valuable. The number removed to hospital was 142, or 71.3 per cent, of the total cases, a larger proportion than in any 41 Parish of Clapham. previous year. The figures for the last three years 37.0, 47 3 and 57.4 per cent, show how the proportion has been steadily rising. It raises the question as to the amount of hospital accommodation necessary in London. It may be taken for granted that Clapham is a fairly representative district as regards the proportion of cases of infectious disease requiring to be removed to hospital; so that if over 71 per cent, of the cases need removal all over London, it will involve a very considerable increase of hospital accommodation. I think there is no doubt that a considerable number of persons make use of the hospitals for isolation purposes, who are of a social position not originally contemplated as hospital patients. It cannot be maintained, however, that they have not the right to use the hospitals, for which all ratepayers contribute; so all that can be done is to provide more accommodation as required. There was not any great delay or difficulty in getting patients removed in 1897. Proceedings were taken in the police-court against a young man for exposing himself in a public place while suffering from Scarlet Fever, and the summons was dismissed. The case illustrates a difficulty that has several times arisen. The patient had called at the surgery of a doctor, who apparently did not satisfy him as to the nature of his illness and did not impress on him sufficiently the need of isolation. The doctor did not see him again, but afterwards notified the case. On seeing him more than once later on I did not find any peeling, so possibly it was not Scarlet Fever; at all events, the magistrate was not satisfied that there was wilful exposure. There were four instances during the year in which there seemed to have been re-infection of households coincidently with the return of a patient from hospital, and, therefore, probably due to the return of the patient 42 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. in an infective condition. In two of the instances nothing could be detected wrong, neither peeling nor discharges, but in the other two, the children had discharge from the ears. It is well known that these discharges remain infective for a very long period, and it would not be possible to retain every case in hospital until the discharge were cured, as it might go on, in spite of treatment, almost for years. Some amount of risk appears to be unavoidable, and it does not at all show that the officials of the Asylums Board hospitals neglect any precaution that should be taken; in fact, it is certain that the contrary is the case. There were 93 cases notified; the number in Diphtheria. the three preceding years was 126, 112 and 68. There has, therefore been a larger number notified than in 1896, but less than in the previous two years. The number of deaths was 20. This is an increase on the preceding year and is a larger number than in any year since 1894 when there were 39 deaths. Diphtheria was therefore proportionately more fatal last year than it had previously been, the mortality being 21.5 per cent. Of the total cases 49 were removed to hospital, a proportion of 52.6 per cent. The number notified in each month were as follows:— January 3. July 10. February 3. August 9. March 6. September 16. April 4. October 16. May 3. November 8. June 6. December 9. This shows a gradual increase from the beginning of the year to a maximum in September and October, checked only by a slight fall in August, associated probably with the school holidays. It is of interest to note that as the result of careful examination of the houses in which the cases occurred, defects were found in 19 only of 43 Parish of Clapham. them, and these largely conditions of dampness. This would seem to show that personal infection must have considerable influence in spreading the disease. There were two cases of Membranous Croup notified in the months of June and July; both of which died, and in one of which instances grave sanitary defects were found in the premises. Enteric Fever. There were 21 cases notified during the year, with five deaths. This is the same number of deaths as in the previous year, and there is seen to be but small variation in the number from year to year; in fact, they have only ranged from three to seven in the last 10 years. In seven of the dwellings occupied bv the sufferers sanitary defects were found of more or less serious kinds. Two of the cases were contracted undoubtedly outside the district (besides possibly some others), and one was attributed to eating oysters. The number in each month was as follows:— January 3. July 3. February I. August 1. March 0. September 1. April 0. October 2. May 1. November 6. June 3. December 0. Nearly one-third of the cases is seen to have occurred in the month of November. Puerperal Fever. There was one case notified and there was one death. This seems to strengthen the belief that a large proportion of the cases of Puerperal Fever are not reported at all, for it is not to be supposed that all are fatal. Erysipelas. There w ere 57 cases notified, and there was one death. Most of those notified were, of course, of a trivial character. 41 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Measles. The deaths from this cause were 16; less than half the number in 1896, and a number actually smaller than in any year since 1889. The mortality, however, makes a considerable item in the total for all the zymotics. That alone should cause its inclusion in the list of diseases, the spread of which we seriously attempt to prevent. The necessary first step would be to make it notifiable. Whooping Cough. The deaths were only six; a smaller figure than in any year of the past decade. The usual association of Measles and Whooping Cough is shown in this. Diarrhoea. The deaths were 47, which was an unusually large number and exceeded any year of the decade. The nearest approach to it was 1895, when the deaths numbered 41. The increase was, no doubt, due to the hot weather in the summer. Influenza. There were only 9 deaths referred to this cause; less than in any year since 1890. It is to be hoped, but perhaps hardly to be expected, that this decrease will be permanent. table TABLE 0F POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, (B) coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, during the year 1897, in the Metropolitan Sanitary Sub-District of Clapham ; classified according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.

Cancer, etc. The deaths numbered 66, a very large number and showing an excess over the decennial average of no less than 32. Of these, however, 19 occurred in the Home for the Dying, and do not properly belong to Clapham. There still remains, however, a considerable increase under this heading; the total being largely in excess of any single year. Tubercular Diseases. There were 90 deaths from this cause, exceeding the decennial average by 11. These 11, however, all occurred in the Home for the Dying, and were 47 Parish, of Clapham. of non-parishioners; so that the real number is exactly the average. The number is not a high one, and may be taken as an indication of a fairly satisfactory sanitary condition in the sub-district, for which tubercular diseases form a fair index. Diseases of the Nervous System. There were 54 deaths, or 20 below the average. Diseases of the Organs of Circulation. The deaths were 64 and exceeded the average by three. Diseases of the Lungs. These diseases resulted in 104 deaths, or 20 less than the corrected average. This saving, of course, largely depends on climatic conditions. Diseases of the Digestive System. The deaths numbered 24, and were 10 below the average. Premature Birth, etc. There were 58 deaths, which exceeded the average by four, while there was a saving under the head of Old Age of the same amount. Deaths from Violence. These numbered 14, the same as last year and one less than the average. inquests The number held during the year was 32, and the following were the verdicts:— Males. Females. Total.

Last year there were 19 deaths so registered. General Sanitary Proceedings. Disinfection During the year, 328 rooms in 243 houses were disinfected by sulphur fumigation. In addition, rooms in 15 houses were certified by the medical practioner in attendance to have been disinfected to his satisfaction. 257 lots of bedding were disinfected by steam by the contractor. No further steps have been taken in the direction of providing a disinfecting apparatus; the difficulty in finding a site having up to now proved insuperable. Notices were served to strip and cleanse 324 rooms after infectious disease, and in 67 cases the work was done bv the Board's emoloves. Unsound Food. The following articles were found to be unsound and unfit for food and were destroyed. In no instance were they attempted to be sold as food but were brought to us by the retailer, so that no proceedings were taken. The list comprises:—4½ barrels of apples, 1 box 49 Pariah of Clapham. of herrings, 3 trunks of codfish, 5 boxes of cherries, 20 pecks of strawberries, ½ barrel of potatoes, 10 bags of peas, ½ bushel of bananas, 1 box of hake, 9 lobsters, 5 crabs, 11 turkeys and a fore-quarter of beef. The system is very common of selling this class of goods packed in crates just as they are brought into the market, and without allowing inspection by the purchaser, usually of the costermonger class. The salesman refunds the money, if the food is subsequently found unsound by the sanitary officers. Underground Rooms. There are only seven of these on the register, and all were regularly inspected. Of course, there are very many rooms used for sleeping and living in, which are in equal need of supervision, but which are not separately occupied. Workshops. The number on the register was 226, and they were regularly inspected; 22 required cleansing, one was overcrowded, one needed an additional water-closet, which was provided, and in four the water-closets had to be properly screened having regard to the separation of the sexes. Bakehouses. They were inspected twice during the year, and were 46 in number. Limewhiting was required in 21 instances in May, and 24 in October. Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses. All were inspected in September, aud no objection was made to the renewal of the licelses. Smoke Nuisances. Only two serious cases came under notice, and they did not recur after warning. Houses Let in Lodgings. The question of the utility of the bye-laws as to these has come much under my notice of late. I am afraid that the one street in which the E 50 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. bye-laws have been enforced is not in a much better condition than was formerly the case. The important element is undoubtedly frequent inspection, for landlords who cater for the class of tenants I am referring to, will not take the trouble to do the frequent cleansing work that is necessary, without very constant looking up. Then there are many other nuisances recurring, such as defective waterclosets, dilapidated walls and staircases, leaky roofs, &c., that cannot be dealt with under the bye-laws, but require the service of another set of notices, so that the procedure is made more complicated. There is also the difficulty that where a tenant (usually himself a weekly one) sublets to others; it is he who has to be proceeded against for breaches of the bye-laws as regards the sub-let portion, manifestly a hopeless business. On the whole it seems to me that proceedings under the nuisance section of the Public Health Act, provided that inspections are made frequently enough, is equally effectual in dealing w ith such houses. General Nuisances During the year 5,548 houses and premises were inspected, of which 1,319 were systematic house to house inspections, and the total number of nuisances dealt with amounted to 4,733. Of these 823 were abated without the service of of a notice, and 3,910 after such service. The number of notices served was 2,102, of which 2,000 were preliminary and 162 statutory. The Table on page 30 gives a statement of nuisances that can be conveniently classified, and others not appearing there, involved the carrying out of work, amongst which was the following:—338 new watercloset apparatus fixed in place of old ones, 12 additional waterclosets built, seven watercloset pans disconnected from the drinking water cisterns one closet apartment ventilated, 140 new soil pipes fixed, 20 existing soil pipes repaired, 12 ventilating pipes repaired, 45 leaky water fittings 51 Parish of Clapham. repaired, 43 damp houses remedied, 29 walls, 59 floors and 23 windows repaired, three basement and one other room ventilated, 207 cases of water in the basement dealt with, two underground rooms not complying with the law, two closets and one privy abolished, two slop sinks, 12 new sinks, 13 new lavatory basins and 8 new baths fixed, one new urinal, 33 manure pits reconstructed or repaired, two lots of land drained, 16 drinking-water supplies laid on from the main, 49 sinks, 15 baths and lavatories repaired, four refuse receptacles provided, two private roads repaired, one pond cleansed, and also the following complaints:—burning of animal matter, 10 cases of rats, nine cases of animals kept so as to be a nuisance (two of rabbits, three of fowls, three of pigeons, and one of cats.) The drains of 126 houses and premises have been reconstructed, 188 inspection chambers have been built, and 246 new ventilating pipes have been fixed; and of these 58 new drains, 89 inspection chambers, and 91 ventilating pipes were constructed without any notice from the inspectors. It has been my duty on numerous occasions to report, that builders and others, have not complied with Bye-law 14, Sect. 39 (1), Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which requires notice to be given before commencing work on a water closet, &c., but as yet it has not been thought well to take proceedings for penalties. I think the time has come when severer measures should be taken, as it is probable that there is work done of which we know nothing, and which may be improperly carried out, Magisterial Seven summonses were issued in connection Proceedings, with nuisances, and of these 5 were withdrawn on payment of 2s. costs each, the necessary work having been carried out, and in the other two cases the Magistrate E 2 52 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. made orders for the work to be done, with a fine of 28s. and Ss. costs in one instance. Twelve summonses were issued for infringements of the Bye-laws, 10 of these were withdrawn on payment of the costs, the work having been satisfactorily done, and in two cases the defendant was fined 5s. and costs. Three summonses were issued under the Metropolis Local Management Acts in respect of new buildings, and the work having been done, they were withdrawn on payment of the costs. I, again, express my satisfaction with the work done by the Sanitary Inspectors, who have all discharged their difficult duties well. OLIVER FIELD, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Clapham PUTNEY & ROEHAMPTON. I estimate the population in the sub-district of Putney and. Roehampton to be 21, 125. This number will be taken as the basis of calculation in the various tables included in this report. 1 his number is an increase of 559 on the population of the preceding year. Births and The total number of births registered was Birth-rates. 510, which is equivalent to a birth-rate of 241 per 1,000 per annum. The decennial average was 24 1. The birth-rate tends to remain, therefore, very stable. Of the 510 births, 278 were males, and 232 females—a large excess of males over females. Deaths and 238 deaths were registered within the subDeath-rates. district, from all causes, and of these, 121 were males and 117 females. Six deaths of those registered within the sub-district were of non-parishioners. During the year, however, 49 parishioners died outside the parish in various outlying institutions. 54 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The death-rate, including only the deaths registered within the sub-district was 11.2 per 1,000 per annum. A more correct death-rate would be obtained by excluding the deaths of non-parishioners registered within the subdistrict and adding those of parishioners who died in outlying institutions. When corrected in this way, the death-rate is found to be l3.3 per 1,000 per[???]annum. The death-rate for the year compares favourably with that of the preceding ten years. The decennial average was 12.13 per 1,000 per annum. The death-rate for the year was, therefore, .9 per 1,000 per annum below the decennial average. TABLE I. Birth and Death Rales. YEARS.

This number gives us what would be the natural increase of the population, supposing no immigration or emigration of residents took place. 55 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. Deaths in Outlying Institutions. 49 deaths occurred among parishioners in outlying institutions. Six of these deaths resulted from diseases of a zymotic character.

Thirty-eight deaths occurred from diseases of this character compared with 54 during 1896. More than half of these deaths were from Diarrhoea and Dysentery. The zymotic death-rate was 1.'7 per 1,000 per annum. The decennial average was 1.5 per 1,000 per annum. If we add the six deaths which occurred iu outlying institutions, it gives us a total of 44 deaths from zymotic diseases, which is equivalent to a zymotic death-rate of 2 per 1,000 per annum. One hundred and thirty-nine notifications of dangerous infectious diseases were received from medical practitioners. 59 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton.

In my last Annual Report I mentioned the Diphtheria. • fact of the existence of Diphtheria in an epidemic form during the last three months of 1896. In the month of January, 1897, there were twelve further cases notified. After this month, the disease became sporadic. 46 cases were notified during the twelve months, and seven ended fatally. This is equivalent to a case mortality of 15 per cent. Twenty-six cases were removed to hospital, and of these three died. Twenty cases were retained at home, and of these J four died. The greater mortality among those cases retained at home, arose from the fact, that some of these cases were considered to be in too serious a condition to stand the fatigue of removal. The death-rate of Diphtheria per thousand living of the population was .33. Under the head of Membranous Croup no notifications were received. All such cases are now returned under the head of Diphtheria. Erysipelas. Nine cases of this disease were notified. All were of minor importance from a sanitary point of view and resulted in no deaths. Scarlet Fever. Sixty-eight notifications were received under this head. It is interesting to note that the months when the greatest prevalence of Diphtheria obtained were also those when the number of notifications of Scarlet Fever reached the maximum. In the month of November, 18 notifications were received, very much in excess of the number received during any other month. During the year 1896, there was a corresponding increase in both these diseases during the latter three months, and 63 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. in the combined report of the District for that year a striking increase is shown in the chart indicating the prevalence of infectious disease for the same period of the year, in respect of both Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. Three deaths resulted from the 68 cases notified and these all occurred among the patients removed to hospital. 43 of the cases were removed to hospital, equal to 63 per cent. of the total number. The case mortality was 4 per cent., a very much higher mortality than during the previous year. It is, however, fair to add that one of the fatal cases registered as occurring from Scarlet Fever was also complicated with Diphtheria. The mortality per 1,000 of the population was .1 arising from this disease. Typhoid Fever. Thirteen notifications were received under this heading. During the spring and summer months as usual there was very little disease of this character. One of the cases ended fatally, which is equivalent to a case mortality of 7 per cent. and per 1,000 of the population the mortality was .04. The sanitary condition of all the houses in which cases occurred was examined and defects were discovered in four of them. Measles and Whooping Cough. I am glad to be able to report that the mortality attending these two diseases was very small compared with the preceding year. No deaths arose from Measles and only seven from Whooping Cough, which is equal to .3 per 1,000 of the population. Small Pox. One case of Small Pox was imported into the sub-district. It was the case of a young man who had just returned from India and had evidently contracted the disease on his way home. He was removed to hospital and the necessary disinfection was carried out. No further case was reported. Puerperal Fever. Two cases were notified, both ended in recovery. 64 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Influenza. Five deaths were registered under this head. Although prevalent to a considerable extent, the type of the disease was certainly very much milder than during the epidemic of 1895. Diarrhoea. This disease was the cause of most of the deaths which occurred from zymotic causes. 19 of these cases were children under one year of age. Most of them were doubtless caused by insufficient care in dieting. Deaths from Non-Zymotic Diseases. 200 deaths were caused by these diseases—an increase by two on those of the previous year. Cancer and other Tumours. Eighteen deaths were registered under this heading—the highest number yet recorded. In my former report I have drawn attention to the fact that there has been a tendency for the mortality from Cancer to gradually increase. The number of deaths registered from this cause during 1897 was three times greater than the number registered during 1889. Phthisis. The reverse condition has taken place in respect of Phthisis. During the last nine years the number of deaths from Phthisis and other tubercular disease reached the maximum in 1890, when the number of deaths registered was 31. During 1897 the number was reduced to 17. This is very gratifying. I think there can be no doubt, that the sanitary improvements of recent years, in regard to over-crowding and removal of all nuisances, have had a controlling effect in the extension of these diseases. Nervous Diseases. The number of deaths under this heading remained very much as before and calls for no special comment. 65 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. Non-Zymotic Diseases were the cause of 200 deaths. TABLE. VII. COMPARATIVE TABLE OF NON-ZYMOTIC MORTALITY. CAUSES OF DEATH. 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 Constitutional.

The deaths from heart disease have been on the increase within the last few years. During 1897, 33 deaths occurred from this cause, the largest number on record in this sub-district. During 1896, the number then registered was the largest number recorded up till that period. In this larger mortality I think we see one of the secondary results of influenza. Inquests. Only seven inquests were held during the year. I do not recollect any year when so few deaths occurred necessitating a Coroner's inquest. Males. Females. Total.

The method of disinfection followed in this district was the same as in former years. The bedding and all soft goods exposed to infection are subjected to the action of super-heated steam. At the same time the wallpaper is stripped off and the flooring is scrubbed with soap and carbolic acid solution after sulphur fumigation of the infected room. Other methods of disinfection are now frequently adopted such as formalin evaporation, or the perchloride of mercury spray. It is agreed that they have a greater germicidal power than the sulphur in fumigation. The results of our method of disinfection, however, could I think scarcely be surpassed in practical results. There were 133 rooms disinfected after infectious disease during the year, and there was a recurrence of disease in not a single instance after disinfection had been carried out. I am glad to say we have had no return cases of Scarlet Fever from hospital during 1897. The average period of retention in hospital in London is considerably longer than is thought necessary in the provinces. In spite of this I freely admit that return cases will sometimes occur although every possible care has been exercised by the medical officers in charge. It appears to me that infection in these cases is most frequently communicated through the throat, nose, or ear discharges. It is manifest that as these discharges may continue for months after the patients are convalescent, it is impossible to retain them in hospital all that period. Instructions should be given, and no doubt are given already on their departure from hospital to continue the local treatment, in their own houses. The difficulty, however, is that although instructions may be given it is absolutely certain that in nine cases out of ten they will not be carried out. Sanitary Work. A Table is given as usual of the various sanitary operations carried out during the 67 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. year. There were 2,999 houses and premises inspected, an increase, I am pleased to say, over the number of the previous year. It was found necessary as the result of these inspections to serve notices to remedy sanitary defects in 640 cases. In only 37 of these cases was it necessary to serve second notices. Three cases were investigated by the Magistrate who granted a compulsory order in each case. After infectious disease the bedding, etc., was stoved in 109 cases. Overorowding was abated in 3 cases. 89 Rooms were cleansed and repaired. 47 Staircases and passages were cleansed and repaired. 87 New drains and drains relaid. 123 Drains cleansed and repaired. 56 Syphon traps fixed to drains. 13 Sinks altered to discharge over gullies. 11 Bath and lavatory wastes altered to discharge outside over gullies. 17 Rain water pipes disconnected from drains. 198 Water-closets cleansed and repaired. 19 Accumulations of manure removed. 75 Yards drained or paved and cleansed. There were 6t5 unclassified nuisances which included the following:— 22 Soil and ventilating pipes re-caulked. 3 Rotten wood flooring repaired. 12 Water pipes repaired to prevent soakage of walls. 4 Waste pipes of sinks repaired. 1 to drain sub-soil to prevent floodings of cellars. 6 to discontinue keeping animals so as to be a nuisance. 15 Separate supply of water for drinking purposes provided. In the process of disinfection the following amounts of the various substances have been used:— 49 gallons of carbolic acid containing 95 per cent. of tar acid. 46 cwts. of carbolic powder containing 15 per cent. of carbolic acid. 2 cwts. 1 qr. 8 lb. of roll sulphur. F 2 68 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. An analysis has been made of the water supplied by the public fountains of the sub-district, and the water found to be satisfactory. An analysis of the water contained in the two wells on Putney Heath was also made. I came to the conclusion from the results of these analyses that the water did not come from deep springs, but was the result of surface drainage. The water in the well at the iron house was decidedly impure, and could not be used with safety for drinking purposes. All the Bakehouses have been frequently inspected and found in a satisfactory condition. The necessary cleansing and limewhiting has been done twice during the year. All workshops have been inspected and found satisfactory with five exceptions. In four of these cases there was insufficient ventilation to wahhouse, and in one case, insufficient watercloset accommodation. Notices were served in all these cases and the necessary work done. The fishmongers' shops have been frequently inspected, and the offal removed to our satisfaction. The cowsheds and slaughter-houses were inspected in the autumn, and we offered no objection to the renewal of their licenses. Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. These bye-laws, although passed by the Wandsworth Board, and sanctioned by the Local Government Board in 1893, have never been in force in this district. In this respect we are in the same condition as a good many other districts in the metropolis. The county Council has made enquiries into the extent to 69 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. which these bye-laws are being enforced. I believe they have already made, or intend at an early date making, a representation to the Local Government Board, in the case of at least one authority which is not carrying out the provisions of section 94 of the Act. My difficulty in regard to the enforcement of these by-laws in this sub-district may he stated shortly. The bye-laws exempt only those houses where the lodgings are Jet at or above 8s. a week if unfurnished, and at or above 10s. a week if furnished. Practically, nearly all the artisan class of property, at least of recent construction, would be thus placed, under the survey of these bye-laws. Rents of houses for the working-classes arc now so high that one very seldom finds that they are occupied only by one family. As a rule a family occupies each floor. There is a worse class of property in the district, generally of a more ancient date. These were built doubtless when ground was not so valuable, and are me ant for one family only. A great deal of this property is now very dilapidated, and is almost bad enough to be condemned as being uninhabitable Now these houses, although decidedly the most insanitary in the district, would not come under the bye-laws at all, although requiring them most urgently. If we are to carry out the bye-laws as they are evidently meant to be carried out, it means registering an enormous number of houses. I should say roughly that 50 or 60 per cent. of the total number of houses in the district would come under these bye-laws. This would mean that perhaps a register of about 2,000 houses would require to be kept. If kept at all it must be kept accurately. Such a work would be a very great clerical labour and would involve an addition to our office staff. On the register the following particulars require to be inserted:- (a) The total number of rooms in the house. 70 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. (h) The number of rooms let in lodgings. (c) The manner of use of each room. (d) The number, age, and sex of the occupants of each sleeping room. (c) The christian name and surname of the lessee of each room. (i) The amount of rent per week. It is apparent that amongst a constantly changing population formed by the artizan and labouring classes such a register would be daily requiring revision and would be therefore practically unworkable. If on the other hand we are desirous of only putting the bye-laws in force in regard to the worst class of property, we find that most of these houses are exemp[???] from the fact of only being occupied by one family. The sanitary work of the parish has been carried on in a most zealous and harmonious manner by all who have been associated with myself. Wm. Y. ORR, M.B., C.M., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Putney and Roehampton STREATHAM. Population The estimated population of Streathara, for the middle of the year 1897, is 58,183, upon which is based the various mortality and other rates. Births and Birth-rate. During the year, 1,331 births were registered, of which 666 were males and 665 females, the birth-rate thereby produced being equal to 22-8 per 1,000 of the population. During the past few years the birthrate has been on the decline, but, during the year under report, was exactly equal to that of the previous year. Deaths and Death-rate- The deaths registered during the year numbered 567; of these, 286 were of males and 281 of females, the uncorrected death-rate being equal to per 1,000 persons living. This is the lowest rate on record for this sub-district. The corrected death-rate, which is obtained by excluding the number of deaths of non-parishioners occurring within the sub-district (36), and including those of parishioners dying within the Metropolis but outside the Streatham area (106), and producing a total of 637, equal to 10.9 per 1,000 of the population. 72 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Natural increase. The rate of natural increase was equal to 13.1 per 1,000 of the population, the excess of births over deaths numbering 764, of which 3.0 were males and 384 females.

The deaths of parishioners in outlying Metropolitan institutions numbered 106, compared with 93 during the previous year Of the deaths recorded 49 were of males, and 57 of females. Diphtheria contributed largely to the deaths from Zymotic Diseases. In the Wandsworth and Clapham Union Institutions 19 of the deaths occurred, being equal to 17 9 per cent. of 73 Parish of Streatham the deaths occurring in outlying institutions. 56 or 52.8 per cent. in general and special hospitals; 28 or 26.4 per cent. in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, and 3 or 2.9 per cent. elsewhere. Seven Coroner's inquests were held in respect of institution deaths with the following verdicts:— Natural Causes:— Heart Disease (male). Heart Disease (male). Violence:—Accidental Fall (male). Fall (male). Scalds (female). Fall (male). Injury to knee (male).

During the past year, 599 samples of various articles of food and drink have been purchased by the Board and analysed by the public analyst. Of these 571 were reported to be genuine. Eight samples of milk taken at a railway station, being the place of delivery by a wholesale dealer, were reported to be adulterated, but owing to an informality in taking the samples no proceedings were taken in the matter. In three other cases, in which the articles were found to be adulterated, the Board after considering all the circumstances, came to the conclusion that proceedings would not be successful. In case No. 2508, it was thought advisable to take a second sample, and in one case in which the article was found to be slightly adulterated the Board made no order in the matter. In 15 cases proceedings were taken against the vendors, with the following results, viz.:— Article. Case No. Extent of Adulteration. Fines or other Result.

Small Pox. One case only of this disease has been notified during the year under report; the patient was promptly removed to hospital, the household vaccinated by myself, and the premises disinfected; the measures adopted preventing the spread of the disease. Measles. The mortality from this disease was remarkably low, 2 deaths only being recorded, compared with 26 in the previous year, as occurring within the sub-district. In the absence, however, of notification, it is impossible to ascertain the ratio of mortality with sickness from the disease. Judging, however, from the mortality it is fair to conclude that Measles was not at all prevalent during the year. O scarlet Fever. 215 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 248 during 1896. 140 of the cases were removed to isolation hospitals, where 5 terminated fatally; this is a remarkably low mortality and indicates that Scarlet Fever continues to be of a mild type. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. From this disease 164 cases were notified, compared with 60 and 76 during the two previous years respectively, showing that we participated with the rest of the Metropolis in an increased prevalence of the disease. The cases were chiefly amongst children of school age, and the spread is undoubtedly principally due to personal infection. 26 of the cases were of a fatal character, 11 dying at (heir homes and 15 in hospitals. 99 cases were removed to hospital. Typhoid Fever The prevalence of this disease appears to be on the decrease and of a less severe type, 26 cases occurring, compared with 27 in the previous year. 14 81 Parish of Streatham cases were removed to hospital where 3 deaths occurred and a like number at the homes of the patients. Whooping Cough. There Was a very pronounced reduction in the mortality from this disease during the year. 10 deaths (1 in hospital and 9 at home) only occurring, compared with 35 during 1896. Diarrhoea. From Diarrhoea 38 deaths were recorded, compared with 21 during the previous year. Most of the deaths occurring during the third quarter. The following Table gives the number of cases of infectious disease notified, removed to hospital, and the mortality therefrom both in the hospitals and at home. TABLE VI. DISEASES.

The number of deaths under one year of age was 146 ; under five, 190, and under twenty-five, 231. 83 Parish of Streatham. Senile Decay. From Senile Decay 40 deaths were recorded, being equal to 7 0 per cent, of the deaths registered from all causes, of these 18 were of males and 22 females. 172 deaths were recorded at 65 years and upwards, of these 124 were over 70 and 45 were 80 and upwards.

The Sanitary operations performed during the year under report are, as usual, tabulated in the combined Report (Table No. XIII.) During the year 1,250 inspections were made by the staff, including those made from house-to-house, also upon complaints and in dealing with notifications of infectious disease. As a result of these inspections 1,259 notices were served to remedy sanitary defects, &c., and in 40 instances second notices were required to be served. In the supervision of drainage works 9,739 visits were made and the water tests applied in 4,340 instances. After cases of infectious disease, 382 rooms in 307 houses were disinfected by sulphurous acid gas, and clothing submitted to treatment by superheated steam in 291 instances. Drains to 147 premises were relaid or reconstructed, and 328 syphon traps were fixed in lieu of bell traps or 85 Parish of Streatham. other insanitary appliances. The cleansing or repairing of 191 water-closets was also carried out and water laid on in 52 instances. 37 yards were drained and paved and b7 sanitary dustbins provided. Many other important operations will be found classified in the table of the combined report. Bakehouses. The bakehouses, which number 39, were twice inspected during the year, and the requirements of the Factory and "Workshops' Act, as regards cleansing and limewashing, were found to be promptly and effectually carried out. Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses. The whole of the cow-houses and slaughterhouses have been inspected during the year, and in the case of one of the cow-houses, having regard to the insanitary condition of the premises, and upon my recommendation, opposition was made by the Board at the Annual Licensing Meeting of the London County Council to the renewal of the license, which was upheld by the Licensing Committee, and the license refused. In other instances defects of a minor nature were discovered but were promptly remedied by the licensees. Mews, Stables, &c. The improper paving and draining of three stables were required to be remedied, and one case of an animal being kept in an unfit place was dealt with. Public Mortuary. During the year 36 bodies were received into the public mortuary, 35 were for the performance of post-mortem examinations or awaiting Coroner's inquests, and one for the isolation of a fatal 86 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. case of infectious disease, where proper means could not be provided at home. Police Court Proceedings. Magisterial proceedings were taken during the year in 17 cases. 11 were for the enforcement of notices requiring the abatement of nuisances; 5 in respect of contravention of by-laws, by not giving the required notice to the Sanitary Authority before proceeding to execute sanitary works, &c. and one under the provisions of the - Public Health (London) Act for the prevention of the spread of infectious disease, in regard to the exposure of a child suffering from Scarlet Eever in the desquamating stage, in a public place. In this case, notwithstanding cautions by the sanitary officers, the parents had exposed the child, and the magistrate inflicted a fine of £2 and 20s. costs. • Of the 17 summonses issued, 3 were withdrawn upon payment of costs by the defendants, the necessary works having been satisfactorily carried out, and in the remaining 14 instances, magistrate's orders were obtained, and in one case the full penalty was inflicted for noncompliance with such order. I have again to express my regret at the falling off in house-to-house inspection, which is undoubtedly one of the most important duties of the Health Department, and trust that the Local Committee may at an early date see their way clear to give additional aid for the carrying out of this work. It would, moreover, enable us to determine where, with advantage, the bye-laws relative to houses let in lodgings might advisedly be put into force. During the year difficulties have occasionally been experienced in effectually dealing with the disinfection 87 Parish of Streatham. of premises owing to want of an efficient shelter, wliich under Sect. 60 of tlie Public Health (London) Act, 1891, it is undoubtedly the duty of the Sanitary Authority to provide. In conclusion, I am glad to be able to give so satisfactory a report of the Public Health of the subdistrict during the year. E. P. SUTTON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health /or Streatham. TOOTING. Population. The population of Tooting in the middle of the year 1897, estimated in accordance with the method adopted by the Registrar General, is 7,611. Births & Birth Rate. The births registered during the year numbered 215, of which 109 were males and 10o females. This is the largest number recorded since a separate record has been made of the vital statistics of this sub-district, and produces a rate equal to 28.2 per 1,000 persons living during the year. Deaths & Death Rate During the year, 352 deaths were registered. Of these, 176 were of males and an exactly equal number were of females. Having regard, however, to the large number xjf non-parishioners dying in the sub-district in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Fever Hospital and other institutions, it is necessary to correct the statistics before proceeding to arrive at the death-rate. 89 Parish of Tooting. Of the 352 deaths registered, 74 only were of parishioners, as the following table indicates:— Parishioners NunParishioners Totals Deaths in Public Institutions 1 275 276 Deaths in Tooting, other than in Public institutions 73 3 76 Totals 74 278 352 To produce the corrected death-rate, the number of deaths of parishioners occurring in outlying public institutions must be added (19), giving a total of 93 deaths, and a rate of 12.2 per 1,000 of the population, the lowest for this sub-district on record. The excess of births over deaths numbered 122, producing a rate of natural increase equal to 16'0 per 1,000 of the population.

Population. The estimated population for the year 1897 was 61,251, an increase of 2553 compared with 1896. From this has to be deducted the population of the various institutions in the parish, this being at the census of 1896, 3906; giving a corrected population of 57,345. The population, calculated from the number of inhabited houses in 1897, and the number of persons per inhabited house at the census of 1896, would have been 58,485. The first method is that adopted by the Registrar General, and it is on these numbers that all the rates given in this report are based. Births and Birth-rate. During the 52 weeks ending 1st January, 1898, the births registered were 1,822, viz: males, 915, and females, 907, an increase of 68, compared with 1896, but a decrease ol 151 compared with the decennial average, corrected for increase of population. The birth-rate was 31.77 per 1,000, an increase of .36 per 1,000 compared with 1896, but 3.84 per 1,000 under the decennial average. 124 births took place in the workhouse, of which H 98 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. 32 belonged to Wandsworth, 57 to Battersea, 13 to Clapham, 9 to Putney, 8 to S treat ham, and 5 to Tooting. The birth-rate after correction was 30.17, compared with 29.6 in 1896. The birth-rate for the Metropolis for the year 1897 was, 299, slightly lower than the corrected birth-rate for this parish The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths was uncorrected 20.25, and corrected 14.16 per 1,000. Deaths and Death-rate. The number of deaths registered was 838, 402 of males and 436 of females. This is a decrease of 48 compared with 1896, and is no less than 121 under the corrected decennial average. The deathrate for the year was 13 68 per 1,000, 1.14 per 1,000 uuder last year, and 2.64 less than than the corrected decennial average. In the several public institutions in the parish, there occurred 172 deaths of persons who belonged to other districts. This shows an increase of 32 compared with the year 1896. Of these, 133 occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 17 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, 3 in St. Peter's Hospital, 9 in the Prison, 8 in the Workhouse, and 2 in the Patriotic Asylum for Girls. No death oocurred in the Boys' Home during the year. There also occurred in various parts of the district, principally from drowning and accident, 5 deaths of persons who resided in other districts, making a total of 177 deaths to he deducted from the total number registered. The death-rate after correction for the above internal institutions was 11.52 per 1,000, 1.83 per 1,000 less than last year, and 2.6 per 1,000 under the corrected decennial average. 99 Parish of Wandsworth.

The death of parishioners in outlying institutions must, however, be added to arrive at the real deathrate, and one which can lie compared with that of the Dther districts in the Metropolis and with the Metropolis itself. The total number of deaths to be added is 241, an mcrease of 36 compared with the year 1896. 137 jf these deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary, 68 in general and special hospitals, and 36 in the various hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board.

Zymotic Diseases. From diseases of the zymotic class, there occurred during the year 128 deaths, 59 of males and. 69 of females. This is a decrease of 53 deaths compared with 1896, and is 25.7 under the corrected decennial average. Last year the number of these deaths was high owing to the prevalence of measles and whooping cough, while in 1897, although the number of deaths was fewer, yet it is unduly raised on account of the epidemic of diphtheria, to which reference will be made later on in this report. The number of deaths which occurred from the notifiable diseases, viz., from scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid fever, puerperal fever, and erysipelas was 46 compared with 20 in 1896, and 19 in 1895. This increase was wholly due to the number of deaths from diphtheria. Table IV. shows the number of deaths from the seven principal epidemic diseases, the total deaths from all zymotic diseases, the zymotic death-rate per 1,000, the total deaths from all causes, and the percentage of deaths from all zymotic diseases to deaths from all causes for the year, as well as for the 10 preceding years, and also the number above or below the corrected decennial average. 106 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report.

The zymotic death-rate for the year was 2 per 1,000, 1.02 per 1,000 under last year, and .56 per 1,000 less than the corrected decennial average. To arrive at the true zymotic death-rate, the number of deaths from these occurring in outlying institutions must be added. Six deaths from zymotic diseases 107 Parish of Wandsworth. occurred in the Union infirmary, one in a general hospital, and 26 in the various hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. There were, as was also the case last year, no deaths from these diseases in any of the institutions in the sub-district. The total number of deaths thus becomes 161, the corrected number last year being 218. The corrected zymotic death-rate per 1,000 was 2.8, compared with 3.96 in 1890, 2 03 in 1895, and 2.64 in 1894. In the Metropolis for the year 1897 the zymotic deathrate was, exclusive of Influenza, 2.57 per 1,000, while in this parish the same rate was 2'49 per 1,000. In 1896, the rate for the Metropolis was 31. and for this parish 3.94 per 1,000. small Pox. There was no death from smallpox during the year, and, as was the case last year, no notifications were received. The official return of the vaccination officer for the year 1896 shows that of 1,723 births registered, 1,344 or 78 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, 9 were certified as being insusceptible of vaccination, 127 died unvaccinated, 19 were postponed, 19 had removed to districts the vaccination officer of which had been duly apprised, 29 bad removed to places unknown, and 176 remained on the books as unvaccinated The number of unvaccinated children in the district is gradually increasing, and this is shown in the following table. These percentages are calculated after deduction of those children who had died unvaccinated, so that for statistical purposes they are fairly correct. 108 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The year 1896 shows a much higher percentage of unvaccinated than any previous year, and unless some alteration in the vaccination laws is made, it is almost certain that this percentage will show a still further increase in 1897 and future years.

The case mortality was 2 39 per cent., while last year the mortality was 3.75 per cent., in 1895 1.63 per cent., and in 1894 2.25 per cent. The type of disease was thus milder than in 1896. The mortality of the cases treated at home was 3.14 per cent., and of the hospital-treated cases 1.93 per cent. The case mortality for the Metropolis for the year was 3.4 per cent. The greatest number of notifications was received in the month of August, when 80 were received, and the minimum, viz. 31, in March. The number received during the year was much above the average, and the Wards in which Scarlet Fever 109 Parish of Wandsworth. was exceptionally prevalent were the Earlsfield and Springfield Wards. 290 notifications, or considerablyover half the total were received from these, 201 from the Earlsfield and 89 from the Springfield Wards. During the year, the proportion of notified cases of Scarlet Fever in London per 1,000 of population was 51, while in this sub district the rate was 8.4. I have again to report that this year great difficulty has been experienced in getting the cases removed to hospital when such removal is most necessary. In several instances five and six days elapsed before removal could be effected, and to this is partially due the increase of notifications. The death-rate per 1,000 from Scarlet Fever was •19, compared with .25 in 1896. For the Metropolis this death-rate was .18. Diphtheria. This disease was the most fatal of all the notifiable zymotic diseases during the year. 243 notifications were received during the year, as compared with 98 in 1896. During the whole year Diphtheria had been more prevalent than in former years, but in February and March two epidemics occurred, and in these 76 cases were notified with 25 deaths, a percentage of nearly 33, while among the other 167 cases notified, 21 deaths occurred, a percentage of 14.3. Of the 243 cases notified during the year, 105 cases were removed to hospital where 19 died, while of the 138 cases that remained at home 30 died. The total number of deaths was 49, and the total case mortality was 20.1 per cent., while in 1898 the case mortality was 12 2, and in 1895 10 per cent. In the Metropolis during the year, the proportion 110 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. notified per 1,000 of population was 2 9, compared with 31 in 1896, while in this sub-district, the proportion notified was 4.03, and in 1896, 1 7 per 1,000. This large increase was almost wholly due to the two epidemics which occurred in Wards 1 and 3 of this parish in the months of February and March, and so fatal were these that a detailed account is necessary. In these outbreaks there is no doubt that in every case personal infection was the only cause in operation, although it was not in every case that such could be definitely proved. These outbreaks occurred in Wards 1 and 3 of the parish, which had a population, principally working class, of 8,670 and 11,817 respectively at the census of 1896. The wards are not adjacent to one another, and the outbreaks had, as far as could be ascertained, no connexion, although in both school infection was proved to have been the means of spread, and this most definitely in the outbreak in Ward 3. That school attendance is a prominent factor in the dissemination of Diphtheria has long been known, and Sir 11. Thorne Thome, in his Milroy Lectures, has summarised all our knowledge of the subject. The conclusions arrived at by Sir R. Thorne Thorne are so generally known that it is unnecessary to recapitulate them, but there is one statement that, in view of the recent outbreaks in this district, is especially noteworthy. Sir R. Thorne Thorne states that "there are ample grounds for believing that the aggregation of children in elementary schools constitutes one of the conditions under which a form of disease of particular potency for spread and for death may be, so to speak, manufactured; "or, in other words, that in Diphtheria there is a "progressive development of the property of infectiveness." Before proceeding to discuss this as a cause of the 1ll Parish of Wandsworth. virulence of the outbreaks it will be necessary to give some particulars with reference to them. In Ward 1 sporadic cases of Diphtheria had occurred during 1896, 27 cases having been notified in that year at intervals of from 14 to 30 days. Most of the cases were exceptionally mild. In January, 1897, however, 8 cases were notified with 3 deaths, 5 of the cases occurring in one family, 2 of these proving fatal. The causation of these 5 cases is important as showing a certain connexion between this outbreak and the one at Roehampton in the adjoining parish of Putney, which had occurred in the months of October and November, 1896. One of the children affected attended a school in Roehampton, at which all the children affected there were scholars, while the other four children attended the hoard school in Ward 1 of this parish. During the month of February, 20 cases were notified with 7 deaths, and in March, 17 with 2 deaths. The total number of cases in the Ward was 45, 25 males and 20 females, with 12 deaths, a percentage of 26.5. These 45 cases occurred in twenty-three households; in four households 5 cases occurred in each; in six, 2 cases; and in thirteen, 1 case. In this Ward there are two schools, one a board school and the other a national school, and of the twenty-three households affected the first cases occurred in thirteen households in children attending the national school, in nine the board school, and in two households the children infected had not been to any school. At first it was difficult to localise the school in which infection took place, as in a preliminary inquiry it was found that the cases occurred in both schools at varying intervals and among children who did not in school associate with one another. In the board school an examination of the cases showed that 10 attended the infant department, 3 the girls' and 2 the boys' departments. In the infant department the first three cases were members of the same family, and none 112 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. of them had been in attendance at school for over seven days. The next two cases in that department did not occur tor three weeks, the first on January 21st, and the second on January 26th, but they did not attend the same class at school, although they, on entering and leaving school, passed through the same corridors. In this department all the children have a common playground. In the girls' department the cases occurred in separate class-rooms. In the boys' department the first case was notified on February 4th and the second on March 2nd. Attention was then directed to the national school, which was attended by a little over 100 scholars, and here, also, it was in the earlier cases difficult to say that school attendance was the sole cause of the outbreak. Five out of ten cases occurred up to February 27th in which the infection was caught at school, two of these being members of the same family. These cases were notified, one on February 16th, two on February 18th, one on February '20th, and one on February 22nd. It was then thought that the outbreak had abated as far as this school was concerned, but on March 3rd three notifications were received, in one of which the first symptoms appeared on February 22nd, in another on the 24th, and in the third on the 27th. On March 4th two notifications were received, in one of which the symptoms were said to have appeared on February 20th, and in the second on the 27th. On March 5th four notifications were received, three of these being with respect to two children and one adult in a previously infected house, while the fourth case did not go to the day-school at all, but to the Sunday-school. All the first children* infected had been in close contact in the above day-school or Sunday-school, and it was also ascertained that of the earlier cases several were in attendance on the Sundayschool, which was held partly in the same building as the day-school. The board school, although attended by 113 Parish of Wandsworth. over 800 scholars, was excluded as the cause of the disease, but the national school was closed on my instructions on March 5th for fourteen days, with the almost immediate effect of checking the outbreak. After that date six notifications were received, only one of these from a household not previously infected. This child had been to school on March 5th, the first symptoms appearing on the 7th. The other five were secondary cases. Out of the twenty-three households infected in only six were there any sanitary defects, and these were of a minor character. In four the connexion between the water-closet and the drains was defective. In this outbreak it was at first difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion as to its causation, owing to delay in notification of the cases. In four of the cases no medical man was called in until some time had elapsed, and children from the infected households were meanwhile attending school. In one or two cases there was difficulty in diagnosis as some of the attacks were mild and not well-marked, whereas others were of a severe and virulent type. The fact that the outbreak was checked by the closure of the school affords strong grounds for the belief that, at any rate in the later cases, the infection was received at school, principally at Sunday-school, where the same control is not possible as far as overcrowding is concerned. The outbreak in Ward 3 was of a very malignant character, and this was specially marked in the primary cases. This outbreak was limited to children attending one school, and the infection was traced to the attendance of a child suffering from the disease at school on the afternoon of March 2nd. For some months previous to this no cases had occurred in this neighbourhood, and the school had always remained very free from diseases 1 114 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. of an infectious nature. Inclusive of the above case, 31 notifications were received between March 6th and 18th, and 13 deaths resulted, a percentage of nearly 42. The first case which was the cause of the outbreak proved fatal, and of the 11 cases primarily infected by this 7 died. In seven cases the first symptoms appeared on the evening of March 4th, and of those 6 died; in four on March5th, with 1 death; and in four on the 6th, with 1 death. These 15 cases were all infected at school on March 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, and, as might have been anticipated, were the cause of other cases, not only in the same households, but in others. One monitor, a girl aged fourteen years, was infected on March 5th, as on that date in school she nursed one of the previously infected cases who had turned ill, and the first symptoms appeared on March 8th. The type of disease in the early cases was more virulent, but the secondary and tertiary cases were of a milder type. In all, twenty-five households were infected, but, owing to prompt diagnosis, notification and isolation, the outbreak did not last long. The disease was so virulent and the symptoms in the early stages were so definite that prompt isolation was at once carried out, with the result that in these households only two had secondary or tertiary cases. The school was closed on March 8th for twenty-one days, and after that date thirteen cases were notified, but of these four cases occurred in households previously infected. An analysis of the other nine cases showed that two in whom the first symptoms appeared on March 9th had been at school on the 5th and 8th, while the remaining seven were all ascertained to have come in direct contact with some of the previously notified cases. The last notification from this part of the district was received on March 22nd, the first symptoms having appeared on the 20th. and the outbreak subsided almost as rapidly as it had commenced. In nine of the houses where cases occurred sanitary defects were 115 Parish of Wandsworth. found after testing, but these, as in the outbreak in Ward 1, were of a slight character, mainly consisting of defective watercloset arrangements. In all the cases occurring in these houses a definite history of contact with a previous case was obtained. The milk-supply in all cases was the subject of careful inquiry, but no connexion between this and the outbreaks in either Ward could be traced. The sanitary arrangements of the school in Ward 1 were carefully examined and the drains tested, but only a slight defect was found, this consisting of an untrapped rainwater pipe. In Ward 3 the sanitary arrangements of the school were excellent, the drains having only recently been laid under the supervision of the sanitary inspector. A review of all the circumstances attending the three outbreaks—the one at Roehampton and the two in Wandsworth—emphasises the fact that Diphtheria may show varying degrees of virulence in different outbreaks. In the Roehampton outbreak out of 30 cases reported not one proved fatal. In the first outbreak in this parish 45 cases were reported, of which 12 proved fatal, and in the second 31 cases with 13 deaths. Again, in Ward 1 of this parish Diphtheria had been present, though in a mild form, during the previous year; and it is a well-known fact that virulent outbreaks are frequently preceded by a prevalence of sore-throat or of true Diphtheria of a mild character. It is difficult, to say definitely whether the outbreak in Ward 3 arose out of that in Ward 1. Every inquiry was made into the history of the child first affected in Ward 3, but no definite information could be obtained as to contact with any of the cases in Ward 1. It is quite within the bounds of possibility that such contact did take place, and if so it would further verify the statement made by Sir R. Thorne Thorne as to the progressive power of infectiveness of this disease. The lessons to be drawn from these and similar outbreaks are, in my opinion—that all cases of 12 116 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. sore-throat should be immediately isolated, and that when possible a bacteriological examination should be made. Immediate notification should be made to the Medical Officer of Health, not only of cases where the symptoms are on the first examination definite, but also in all cases which are at all suspicious. These measures would ensure the exclusion of all infected children from school, and this is, in my opinion, the most important etiological factor in the dissemination of Diphtheria in urban localities, and especially in the Metropolis. In the whole parish 35 notifications of Diphtheria were received in the month of February, 70 in March and only 7 in April, showing that by the end of March, as an epidemic, the disease had ceased, although sporadic cases still occurred. Membranous Croup. Four notifications were received and one death occurred. Most of the cases of Membranous Croup are now notified as Diphtheria. The total case mortality from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup was 20.2 per cent, while in 1896 this was 13 per cent., and in 1895, 15.5 per cent. For the Metropolis the case mortality for the year was 17 per cent., compared with 19.2 per cent. in 1896, and 20.4 in 1895. Enteric Fever. 37 cases were notified and four deaths resulted, while in 1896, 22 cases were notified and 4 deaths also occurred. 16 of these were removed to hospital where one died, and 21 were treated at home with three deaths. In this parish, for the year the proportion of cases of Enteric Fever notified per 1,000 of population was .6, while in the Metropolis this rate was .69. 117 Parish of Wandsworth. Of the 37 cases notified, in only a few could any definite history of infection be ascertained, and in only one was there any grave sanitary defect in the house occupied by the patient. Two of the cases have an interesting history as the cause was definitely traced to the eating of oysters at Clacton, on the 23rd of August. These cases have an additional interest attached to them, as the Local Government Board are presently inquiring into an outbreak at Clacton which occurred in September, and which it is believed was due to the same cause. Another case notified on the 24th September had come from Maidstone on the 18th, and was removed again to that place, where the patient died. In another case the patient had been working for five weeks previous to the onset at the Croydon Sewage Works. Eating oysters was the cause of another case, the patient having had these 14 days before at a restaurant in the city In a case notified on the 25th October the patient had come from Folkestone on the 22nd October, having been there since September 6th The annual death-rate from fever in the Sub-district was .08 per 1,000, and in the Metropolis .10 per 1,000. Puerperal Fever. Six cases were notified and of these four died, compared with seven notifications and one death in 1896. Erysipelas. 111 cases were notified, compared with 116 in 1896. One death only was registered, while in 1896 five deaths occurred. 118 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Measles. This disease was not nearly so prevalent during the year, and only four deaths occurred, compared with 58 in 1896. The number of deaths is also 28.2 below the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The death-rate per 1,000 from Measles was .06 compared with .43 in the Metropolis. Whooping Cough. Only 12 deaths were registered from this, compared with 53 in 1896, and with 31, which is the decennial average. All the deaths were of children under five years. Four deaths also occurred in external institutions. The death-rate per 1,000 was .27 in this parish, while for the Metropolis the rate was .41. Diarrhœa. 48 deaths were registered as occurring from this, four above last year and 7.7 above the decennial average. One death occurred in an external institution. Of the total deaths from this disease, 40 were of children under one year, five under five years, while only three persons above five years of age died during the year. The rate per 1,000 was .85 compared with .9 in 1896. In the Metropolis the rate was .91 compared with .72 in 1896. Influenza. 18 deaths were caused by this during the year, one of the deaths occurring in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and 1 in St. Peter's Hospital. 2 deaths also occurred in outside institutions, making a corrected total of 18. Last year only 7 deaths occurred from this, while in 1895 the number was 39. The following are the death-rates per 1,000 of the population from zymotic diseases, inclusive of deaths 119 Parish of Wandsworth. in outlying institutions for the years 1895, 1893, and 1897.

Notification of Infectious Diseases During the year 1897, 904 cases of infectious disease were notified by medical practitioners, an increase of 250 compared with the year 1897. The numbers for the previous years were in 1892, 588, in 1893, 868, in 1894, 444, in 1895, 445, and in 1896, 654. Scarlet Fever shows a large increase, viz.: 101 over last year, while Diphtheria shows a very large increase. This was, as has been already stated, due to two outbreaks in February and March, which have been dealt with in another part of this report. The annual rate for these notifiable diseases per 1,000 persons living was, in this parish, 14.7 compared with 11.1 in 1S96, and 7.6 in 1895. For the whole Metropolis for the year the rate was 10.2, compared with 11.1 in 1896, and 9.5 in 1895. The death-rate per 1,000 from all notifiable diseases was 1.1, compared with .66 in 1896, while for the whole Metropolis the rate was .81, compared with .72 in 1896. This increase was wholly due to the deaths from Diphtheria, the total number of which was 50 compared with 13 in 1896. The total number of deaths was 72, of which 50 took place from Diphtheria, and 12 from Scarlet Fever. 26 of these deaths occurred in hospital and 46 died at home. This was equal to 7.9 per cent. of the cases notified, compared with 5.9 in 1896, 6.9 in 1895, 10 36 in 1894, and 8 8 in 1893.

It is seen from this Table that the Earlsfield Ward had an unusual number of cases of infectious disease, the great majority of these cases being Scarlet Fever. In the Southfield Ward, Diphtheria was the most prevalent disease during the year, while the Northfield Ward shows a comparative absence of cases of an infectious nature. As some of the cases were notified twice, the totals do not correspond with those of Table VII.

In last year's Report, I drew attention to six cases of Scarlet Fever which had occurred after the return of a case from the Fever Hospital. This year I have again to report that several cases have occurred, of which the following are the particulars:— (1).—First case reported on the 9th July, removed to hospital same day, returned on October 5th, and a second case was notified on October 9th. (2).—First case reported on June 18th, removed to hospital same day, returned from hospital August 12th, and a second case was notified on the 24th. (3).—First case notified as Diphtheria on the 8th March, removed to hospital on the same day, returned from hospital on May 24th, and a second case was notified as Scarlet Fever on May 31st. (4).—First case notified on June 30th, removed to hospital same day, returned from hospital on August 14th, 124 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. and three cases were notified on August 18th, and two on August 19th. In this case the parent informed the sanitary inspector that the first case when it was sent home was peeling on the face. (5).—First case notified on December 5th, 1896, removed to hospital same date, returned from hospital on January 21st, 1897, the mother stated to the sanitary inspector that the child was still peeling. A second case case was reported on the 26th January, and a third on February 5th. (6).—First case notified on February 22nd, removed same day, returned from hospital on May 19th. A second case was notified on May 27th, and a third on June 1st Mother reported that the first case had a discharge from the nose when it returned, and that after returning it had slept with second case. (7).—First case notified June 15th, removed same day, returned from hospital on September 3rd. A second case was reported on the 16th September. The mother stated that the first case, when it returned, had a discharge from the nose. (8).—Two cases reported on June 15th, and one on June 18th, probably infected by another case which had been removed to hospital from Lambeth, and returned from hospital to this parish on June 2nd. (9).—First case notified on June 18th, removed same day, returned on October 8th. Second case reported on October 15th, a third on October 18th, and a fourth on November 24th.

They formed 84.7 per cent, of the total mortality compared with 79.5 per cent, in 1896, and 88.23 per cent, in 1895. After correcting for external and internal institutions the total number of deaths was 743, or 82.3 per cent, of the total corrected mortality. The number of deaths from diseases of a tubercular nature, which include Phthisis Pulmonalis and tubercular diseases of the brain and bowels was 94, a slight increase 127 Parish of Wandsworth. compared with 1896, but 30.9 below the corrected decennial average. The number of deaths in external institutions was 27, and in internal institutions 19, the corrected total being thus 102; of these 102, 71 died from Phthisis Pulmonalis, compared with 61 in 1896, 78 in 1895, and 75 in 1894 The totnl death-rate from tubercular diseases for the year was 179 per 1,000, compared with 1.73 in 1896. The death-rate in England and Wales for the decennium 1881-90 was 2.43. From Phthisis Pulmonalis alone the death-rate in this parish was l.23 per 1,000 compared with 1.09 in 1896, 1.35 in 1895, and 1.73 in England and Wales during the decennium 1881-90. Other tubercular diseases were the cause of 31 deaths, a decrease of 5 compared with 1896. 10 of these deaths were of infants under one year, and 13 of children from 1 to 5 years. Gout, llheumatism, Cancer and other Tumours, which are grouped under other constitutional diseases, were the cause of 57 deaths, compared with 67 in 1896. Nine deaths from these occurred in internal and 20 in external institutions, making a corrected total of 68 compared with 85 in 1896. Cancer alone was the cause of 46 deaths (17 of males and 29 of females), a decrease of 11 compared with 1896. From diseases of the brain and nervous system, 114 deaths occurred, 74 of males and 40 of females. This shows an increase of 30 compared with last year, but is 128 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. 23.4 below the corrected decennial average. 64 or 56 per cent, of the total deaths in this group occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 2 in the Hospital for Incurables, 4 in the Prison, and 1 in St. Peter's Hospital. 32 deaths occurred in external institutions, making a corrected total of 75 compared with 57 in 1896, and 96 in 1895. Diseases of the organs of circulation were the cause of 78 deaths, 25 of males and 53 of females. This is 11 less than last year, but is 14.8 above the decennial average. 43 deaths from these diseases occurred in external institutions, and 9 in internal institutions, raising the total to a corrected one of 121. 30 of the deaths in external institutions occurred in the Union Infirmary. The corrected total in 1896 was 100. Prom diseases of the respiratory organs, 117 deaths occurred, 65 of males and 62 of females. This is 5 under last year and 64.8 under the decennial average. Ten deaths occurred in internal and 29 in external institutions, making a corrected total of 136 compared with 139 in 1890, and 156 in 1895. 58 deaths occurred from diseases of the digestive organs. 24 occurred in external and 4 in internal institutions, making a corrected total of 78. 43 or 55 per cent, of these deaths occurred in infants under one year. Prom urinary diseases, 24 deaths were registered, 3 more than last year, but 4.9 below the decennial average. 7 of these deaths occurred in internal and 3 in external institutions, making a corrected total of 20 compared with 23 in 1896. Prom premature birth, low vitality, and congenital 129 Parish of Wandsworth. defects, 80 deaths occurred, an increase of 9 compared with 1896, and 6.1 above the corrected decennial average. Three deaths from these diseases occurred in external and 4 in internal institutions, the corrected total being 79, compared with 74 in 1896. All these deaths were of infants under one year. From old age, 56 deaths, 24 of males and 32 of females, were registered, 4 more than last year and 12 1 above the decennial average. 26 of these deaths occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 1 in the Hospital for Incurables, 1 in the Workhouse, and 1 in St. Peter's Hospital, a total of 29. In external institutions, 11 deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary, 1 in a special hospital, and 2 in hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, a total of ]4. The corrected total is thus 41, compared with 40 in 1896. Prom violence, 22 deaths, 13 of males and 9 of females were registered. One of these occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 1 in the Prison, and 1 in the Patriotic Asylum for Girls. In external institutions 9 deaths occurred. 4 in the Union Infirmary and 5 in general and special hospitals. Other 3 deaths were registered in the parish of persons belonging to other parishes who had died from accidents. The corrected number of deaths was 25, compared with 24 in 1896. infantile The number of deaths under one year was Mortality. 232, 119 of males and 113 of females, coinpared with 251 in 1896. 34 deaths occurred in institutions outside the district among persons belonging thereto, and 6 occurred within the district among persons belonging to other parishes, making a corrected total of 260, compared with 269 in 1896, and 237 in 1895. The percentage of these deaths to total deaths, K 130 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. corrected for institutions, was 28'8, while in J 896 this percentage was 36.03. The infantile mortality per 1,000 registered births was 127.3, compared with 143 in 1896, 137.9 in 1895, and 121 in 1894. The true infantile mortality, after correcting for institutions, was 156 per 1,000 registered births, compared with 158 per 1,000 in the Metropolis, and 156 in England and Wales. 48 of these deaths occurred from diseases of the zymotic class, 40 being due to Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from premature birth and congenital defects is partly responsible for this high death-rate, while diseases of the respiratory and of the digestive organs also show an increase compared with former years. Senile Mortality. The deaths registered at 70 years and upwards were 199, 79 of males and 120 of females, and formed 22 per cent, of the total mortality. This is an increase of 44 over last year, and of 89 over 1895. As usual the number of deaths of females exceeds that of males, and this year the difference is very marked. Two deaths, both of females, occurred between 95 and 100. Table IX. shows the number of these deaths at different quinquennial periods. TABLE IX. Age. Males. Females. Total.

In the next table is shown the percentage to total deaths, as well as to diseases of the zymotic class, according to the social position of the deceased. The decennial average is also given. It will be noticed that the percentage to total deaths in each group corresponds nearly with the decennial average, but in the zymotic class the industrial and labouring classes shows a decrease in comparison with that average, and there has been a marked decrease in comparison with the year 1896. Among the nobility and gentry, and more especially among the trading classes, there was a decided increase in the number of deaths from these diseases, this being due in the case of the trading classes to the number of deaths from Diphtheria and Influenza.

Uncertified Deaths. Five deaths were uncertified, and were referred to the Coroner, but no inquest was held. One of these was stated to have died from Heartdisease, one from Epilepsy, two from diseases of the digestive organs, and one from Pneumonia. General Remarks. The corrected death-rate for the year, viz. : 15.71 per 1,000, compares favourably with former years, as well as with the Metropolitan death-rate, which was 17.7 per 1,000. To make a more correct comparison, the death-rate for the parish must he multiplied by 1,068 which is a factor for correction for age and sex distribution, making the death-rate 16.77, compared with 18.09 in 1890. The two outbreaks of Diphtheria, and the large number of deaths from Diarrhoea and from premature birth, prevented this death-rate from being lower. Generally, however, the health of the district during the year was excellent, although during the whole year it was evident that unless careful watch was kept on the causes of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever, extensive outbreaks of these would have been the result. Sanitation. Table XIII. in the general report shows the amount of sanitary work performed by the staff during the year. During the year 4,597 houses and premises were inspected, compared with 3,948 in 1896, and 2,871 in 1895. The total number of houses inspected in house-tohouse inspection, which is the "first line of defence" in sanitary work, was 2,325, compared with 1,985 in 1896, 2,079 in 1895, and 2,090 in 1894. 1,158 preliminary and 389 statutory notices were served for the abatement of nuisances compared with 1,204 and 430 in 1896. 134 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The number of houses disinfected after infectious diseases was 643, and the number of rooms 683, an increase compared with last year. This increase was due to the greater number of notified cases of infectious disease. In only very few instances has disinfection been carried out by others than the officers of the sanitary authority, and these tend to diminish year by year, thus making the cost of such disinfection an increasing factor. 660 sets of bedding were this year disinfected by the contractor, and in every instance this was carried out satisfactorily. In view of the increased cost of steam disinfection, I am of opinion that the time has now arrived for the parish to erect a disinfecting station where this could be carried out at a lessened cost and with more direct supervision. I append a table showing the number of cases of infectious disease notified since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, also showing the sets of bedding stoved and the cost of such for each year.

This increased number is due to the fact that the inspectors have devoted more of their time to house-to-house inspection in those localities where such overcrowding would be likely to occur. With the exception of one case, they were all remedied without proceeding to prosecution. In one case, however, proceedings were taken, and a conviction with £1 Is. cosls obtained. The same occupier had been previously summoned, and a penalty inflicted. This house is now on the register of houses let in lodgings. 239 drains were relaid, nnd in all these, the regulations of the Board were carried out, and the drains when completed were water tested. 827 drains were cleansed and repaired and in a large proportion of these the smoke test was used to ascertain if any defect existed after repair. The disconnection of bath wastes, lavatory wastes, and rain-water pipes, show a marked diminution, this being largely due to the fact that few of these are now connected with drains, most of them having been altered in previous years. The number of waterclosets cleansed and repaired was 486, compared with 147 in 1896, and 398 in 1895. In the report for 1896, I gave three reasons why these numbers show a tendency to increase. The number of unclassified nuisances dealt with was 245, compared with 493 in 1896. The other particulars in this table do not require comment, but it is again necessary to draw attention to the fact that although 389 statutory notices were served by order of the Board, in only 7 was it necessary to take proceedings at the Police Court compared with 12 in 1896. The following are the particulars of these seven cases:— 137 Parish of Wandsworth. (1).—Conveying noxious matter in an improper vehicle, fined 5s. and 2s. costs; also for conveying same during prohibited hours, 2s. costs. (2).—Permitting chimney to send forth black smoke—Fined 20s. and 2 s. costs. (3).—Sanitary defects, fined £3s. 3s., and three orders made to drain cellars into sewer. (4).—Collecting noxious matter during prohibited hours, and in a van unfit for the purpose—Fined 20s. and 2s. costs. (5).—Allowing premises to be occupied without a certificate as to the water supply—Fined 20s. and 2s. costs. (tj).—Sanitary defects—Fined 40s. and 6s. costs. (7).—Overcrowding, order made to abate nuisance, with £1 Is. costs. Cowhouses. These, 7 in number, were duly inspected and found to be in a sanitary condition. These still show a tendency to decrease, 2 having had their licences withdrawn since last year. Slaughter Houses. Nine slaughter-houses and one knackers' yard were inspected, and, generally speaking, were found satisfactory. Bake-houses. There are 40 of these in the parish, and they were as usual inspected twice during the year. In two, notices had to be served for lime-whiting and cleansing. Unsound Food. 1 bag of whelks, 1 trunk of codfish, 1 bag of potatoes, 1 barrel of crabs, 1 trunk of plaice, 1 trunk of haddock, and 1 box of skate w ere destroyed during the year, being unfit for food. Factory and Workshops. 99 of these (17 factories and 82 workshops) were inspected during the year, and with the exception of three were found to be in a satisfactory condition from a sanitary poiut of view. In two of these the waterclosets were found to be defective, and in one the washhouse was in a dirty condition. 138 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Only two notices of sanitary defects in workshops were received during the year from the Factory Inspector, and these were at once attended to and the usual notice forwarded to the Factory Inspector when the defects were remedied. Houses Let in Lodgings. During the year, the Sanitary Inspectors have in their house-to-house inspection, come across some houses which were let to more than two families. I have personally visited most of these, and in consequence, reported to the Board, that it would be desirable to register them as houses let in lodgings, in order that cleanliness and overcrowding of such premises could be more expeditiously dealt with. At the present time there are on the register 13 houses, and these have been during the year regularly inspected. In this parish there are a large number of houses which come under the Bye-laws, being let to members of more than one family, and the register will be added to as occasion requires. Before registration, each case is dealt with separately by the Board, and an order made for registering these houses if such is deemed necessary, particularly for prevention of overcrowding. I have again much pleasure in testifying to the satisfactory manner in which the Sanitary Inspectors have performed their duties. P. CALDWELL SMITH, M.A.., M.D., D.P.H , CAMB., Medical Officer of Health for Wandtworth. ANNUAL STATEMENT Of the work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, condensed from his statutory quarterly reports, by THE PUBLIC ANALYST. During the year 1897 the Inspector brought to the South London Central Public Laboratory 597 samples of Food and Drugs, classified as follows:— Dairy products 303 Groceries 200 Bread and cereals 72 Meats 15 Confectionery 4 Drugs 3 597 The following tables indicate the nature and number of the various articles examined and the results of their analysis. I.—Dairy Produce. The articles entered under this head included:— Milk 176 samples. Butter 116 „ Condensed Milk 6 „ Lard 5 ,, Total 303 samples. 140 Report—Public Analyst. All these were legally genuine, except the following 20 which were found to be more or less deficient:— Articles submitted. Nature and extent of Impurity. Milk 26 per cent, of added water. Milk 25 „ „ Milk 25 ,, ,, Milk 23 ,, ,, Milk 23 „ ,, Milk 20 „ ,, Milk 18 ,, ,, Milk 17 „ ,, Milk 14 ,, ,, Milk 12 „ ,, Milk 10 ,, ,, Milk 9 ,, ,, Milk 8 „ ,, Milk 5 „ ,, Milk 5 ,, ,, Milk 55 per cent. of cream deficient. Milk 37 „ ,, Milk 37 „ ,, Milk 33 „ „ Milk 8 „ „ Butter 88 per cent, of Margarine. Butter 50 „ „ Butter 45 „ ,, The above table shows that 11 *31 per cent, of the milk samples departed from the accepted standard of purity, while in the case of butter only 2.59 per cent, of the samples contained margarine. This indicates an improvement in the general butter supply, but a very marked falling off on the part of the milk. It is only fair, however, to the traders in the district to note that, out of the whole 20 samples of milk condemned, 9 were taken at the railway station in course of transit from the farmer to the local dealer, thus reducing the percentage of actual local adulteration to 6.25, which is about the normal average. 141 Report—Public Analyst. II.— Groceries. These included:— Coffee 62 samples Pepper 36 „ Cocoa 24 „ Sugar 18 „ Mustard 18 „ Arrowroot 13 „ Tapioca 13 „ Olive Oil 11 „ Vinegar 3 „ Cayenne 2 „ Total 200 The following 3 were found to be adulterated as under:— Articles submitted. Nature and extent of impurity. Olive Oil 100 per cent, of mineral oil. Olive Oil 100 „ nut oil. Olive Oil 45 „ sesame oil. III.—Bread and Cereals. The following articles were examined and found genuine:— Flour 37 samples. Bread 29 „ Oatmeal 6 „ Total 72 During the year, in the course of my general practice, I met with a sample of foreign flour containing a small percentage of maize, but none of that shipment reached the Wandsworth District so far as we could ascertain, all our local samples being correct in this respect. 142 Report—Public Analyst. IV.— Meats. Under this head 15 samples of sausages were examined and were found to be the usual mixture, consisting of meat, bread, and seasoning. The meat was sound, no deleterious artificial coloring matter had been employed, and they were therefore reported " genuine." V. — Confectionery. The samples submitted were four in number, and consisted of chocolate sweets. They were found to contain no mineral, wax, or other deleterious ingredient, and were therefore classed as "genuine." IV. —Drugs. The number of samples under this head were three, of which two were condemned as shown in the following table:— Articles submitted. Result of analysis. Eucalyptus Oil Genuine Lime Water 50 per cent deficient in strength Lime Water 50 „ „ The sale of deficient lime-water (which in these cases took, place I understand at drug stores) is more likely to be a matter of carelessness, or old bottled stock, than of deliberate intention to defraud, as it is a solution tending to rapidly deposit its lime on keeping if not properly looked after and served fresh. In conclusion, I can only once more repeat that the food supply of the Wandsworth District was, during the year, in a very satisfactory condition, thanks, doubtless, to the deterrent action of the continuous daily inspection kept up by the order of the Board of Works.
