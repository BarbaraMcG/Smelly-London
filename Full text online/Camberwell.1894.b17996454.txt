CAM 2 Camberwell, London. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Vestry Hall 1894-95 MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Ladies and Gentlemen, According to the Registrar-General's Annual Summary, the population of London, estimated from the middle of the year 1894 (the population, therefore, used in the determination of the metropolitan marriage-rate, birthrate, and death-rate) was 4,349,166. The marriages numbered 36,902; the births 130,553; and the deaths 77,039. The marriage-rate was 17·0 per thousand, being lower by 0·2 than that of the previous year; the birth-rate was 30·1 per thousand, being lower by 0·9 than that of 1893. This rate is lower than that of any previous year. The death-rate was 17·8, this rate was lower by 2·6 than the average rate in the previous ten years. Table I. shews the population of London and of its five groups of districts, as ascertained at the censuses of 1881 and 1891 respectively.

It will be seen that the birth-rate of South London is higher than the birthrates of the Western, Northern and Central Districts, but considerably lower than the birth-rate of the Eastern District, and a trifle higher than that for London generally; and that the death-rate of South London is 0·5 higher than that of the Western and Northern Districts, but lower than the rates of all the remaining districts, and of London.

In deaths from hooping cough there was a falling-off of 233; in deaths from scarlet fever a falling-off of 634; in deaths from diphtheria a falling-off of 595; in deaths from fever (mostly typhoid or enteric) a falling-off of 56; in deaths from small-pox a falling-off of 117; and in deaths attributed to influenza a falling-off of 776. The only disease of the kind in which there has been an increase is measles, and in this case there has been an advance of 1,632. It is noteworthy that in 1892 the deaths exceeded those of 1894 by 100. 407 Table III. —Mortality of chief Zymotic Diseases in London for 10 Years. Hooping Cough. Measles. Diphtheria. Small Pox.

It will probably be observed that according to this calculation, the estimated population for the Parish does not correspond accurately with the estimated populations of the sub-districts. This discrepancy (which is unimportant) is due to the fact that each sub-district has had its population deduced from its own special decennial increase between 1881 and 1891 —a mode of calculation which, though in principle strictly correct, does not allow of accurate correspondence.

It will be observed that in the latter year the births were 87 fewer than those in the former year. In Dulwich there was an increase of 14; but in Camberwell a fallingoff of 8; in Peckham a falling-off of 57; and in St. George's a falling-off of 36.

For the Parish there was a fallingoff of 1 per thousand; for Camberwell also a falling-off of 1; for Peckham a falling-off of 1·2; and for St. George's a falling-off of 1·3; while for Dulwich there was an increase from 9 to 10·7.

But meanwhile Table VII. has been constructed for the purpose of forming as correct an estimate as possible of the death-rates of the Parish and of its sub-districts. Table IX. gives the deaths due to the Parish, which actually occurred and were registered within its limits. But a considerable number of deaths due to the Parish took place in hospitals and other institutions placed outside the Parish. These, with some approach to accuracy, are given in Table X. For the purpose of the death-rate the corresponding items in Tables IX. and X., and the combined numbers (representing the total mortality of the Parish and of its sub-districts) are set forth in the first column of Table VII, To Dulwich there are thus attributed 50 deaths, to Camberwell 1,646, to Peckham 1,424, and to St. George's 1,025, and consequently to the whole Parish 4,145. But Camberwell proper contains the workhouse and infirmary, in which 380 deaths occurred, and two lunatic asylums, in which 92 deaths occurred; and Peckham contains an off-shoot of the workhouse, in which 68 deaths occurred. Now these deaths, though happening within these districts, no more properly belong to them than they do to the other districts of the Parish, and if included in the mortality of these districts would unduly and unfairly swell their death-rates. I have, therefore, as I have always hitherto done, distributed them among the several subdistricts in proportion to the deaths (apart from these) due to each. The steps of this calculation are shewn in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns of the Table, and the final result in the last column. It may be added that, even so, there is a little unfairness to the Parish, inasmuch as many of the deaths in the lunatic asylums are of persons who do not properly belong to the Parish; and a little undue partiality to the sub-district of Camberwell and in a less degree to that of Peckham, inasmuch as in the former the populations in the workhouse, infirmary, lunatic asylums, and St. Saviour's infirmary, and in the latter the population in the Gordon Road Workhouse, are included in the populations as given in the census returns. I have, of course, excluded from consideration the deaths occurring in St. Saviour's infirmary, which amounted to 574. Table VII.—Re-distribution of Deaths among Sub-Districts of Camberwell.

If we turn to Table II., which has already been explained, it will be seen that the Southern group of districts has a lower mortality than London as a whole, and a lower mortality than the Central and Eastern Districts. The mortality rate of the Parish of Camberwell was 16·33, 3·05 lower than in the previous year; the mortality of Dulwich was 7·85, 4·23 lower than in the previous year; the mortality of the sub-district of Camberwell was 14·89, 2·45 lower than in the previous year; the mortality of Peckham was 17·72, 1·86 lower than it was in the previous year; and the mortality of St. George's was 17·37, 5·16 lower than in the previous year. The results are highly satisfactory. It will be observed, however, that the birth-rate and death-rate of Dulwich continue, as they always have been, remarkably low.

Table XI. shows the annual mortality for the most important of the so-called "zymotic" diseases from the origin of the Vestry until the end of the year 1894, no correction being made for increase of population. Table XII. displays the returns of the same diseases for the last 6 years quarter by quarter. 140 deaths were due to accidental or other violence, or 11 more than in the previous year. Deaths attributable to premature births or defective vitality and to convulsions of infancy collectively numbered 496 or 14 fewer than in 1893. To child-birth 34 deaths were attributed, 11 fewer than in the previous year, of which 9 were due to various forms of so-called "puerperal fever." 6 of these were due to Camberwell and 3 to Peckham. 28 persons were stated to have died of erysipelas, carbuncle, or pyæmia, against 36 in 1893.

Tubercular diseases, including pulmonary consumption, caused 579 deaths, and cancerous diseases 181, against 680 and 193 respectively in the previous year. Inflammatory affections of the lungs caused 716 deaths, or 224 fewer than in 1892, and diarrhœal affections 115 or 98 fewer than in the year before. The mortality due to the so-called "zymotic" diseases shows for the most part a marked increase as compared with that of the previous year. For full details respecting these diseases I must refer not only to Tables IX. and X., but also to Table XI., which displays the annual mortality referred to these diseases ever since the constitution of the Vestry at the beginning of the year 1856, and to Table XII. in which the mortality of the same diseases is shown quarter by quarter for the last six years. Hooping cough caused 126 deaths, against 104 in 1893 and 128 in 1892. 29 deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year, 47 in the second, 41 in the third, and only 9 in the fourth. It caused 45 in Camberwell, 38 in Peckham, and 43 in St. George's. Measles caused 164 deaths, against 78 in 1893 and 189 in 1892. 16 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 96 in the second, 45 in the third, and only 7 in the fourth. 26 were referred to Camberwell, 70 to Peckham, and 68 to St. George's. Scarlet fever caused 45 deaths, against 80 in 1893, and 63 in 1892. 14 occurred during the first quarter of the year, 13 during the second, 13 during the third, and only 5 during the fourth. 12 took place in Camberwell, 12 in Peckham, and 21 in St. George's. Diphtheria caused 193 deaths, against 118 in 1893, and 85 in 1892. Of these 31 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 41 in the second, 54 in the third, and 67 in the fourth, so that contrary to what happened in respect of the other diseases passed in review, there was a steady rise in the mortality of the disease throughout the year. It may be deserving of note that in the fourth quarter of 1893 the deaths amounted to 60. Of deaths due to this disease 2 belonged to Dulwich, 84 to Camberwell, 67 to Peckham, and 40 to St. George's. Fevers (mostly typhoid or enteric) caused 21 deaths, against 30 in 1893, and 21 in 1892. 5 occurred in the first quarter, 1 in the second, 2 in the third, and 13 in the last. 8 of these belonged to Camberwell, 7 to Peckham, and 6 to St. George's. Small-pox caused 2 deaths, against 11 in 1893, and 1 in 1892. They were both due to Peckham, and both occurred in the second quarter of the year. To diarrhœa were attributed 115 deaths, against 213 in 1893, and 169 in 1892. As usual they occurred mainly during the third quarter of the year. There were 17 in the first quarter, 43 in the second, 71 in the third, and 19 in the fourth. 34 belonged to Camberwell, 55 to Peckham, and 26 to St. George's. No deaths during the year were attributed to epidemic cholera. Influenza was reputed to have caused 37 deaths, against 82 in 1893, and 138 in 1892. Of these 2 belonged to Dulwich, 16 to Camberwell, 13 to Peckham, and 6 to St. George's. 22 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 6 in the second, 1 in the third, and 8 in the fourth. The health of London generally, judged by the death-rate alone, has been unusually good, and it is especially gratifying to note that there has been a marked diminution in the death-rate in all the districts of Camberwell. In Dulwich the death-rate has sunk from 12·08 in a thousand to 7·85, in Camberwell from 17·34 to 14·89, in Peckham from 19·58 to 17·72, and in St. George's from 22·53 to 17·37. For the whole Parish there has been a reduction from 19·38 to 16·33. As usual, of course, the chief mortality has been in children under 5 years of age, and especially of children in their first year. Although a case or two of epidemic cholera were recorded in London, none occurred in Camberwell; and deaths from diarrhœa were unusually few. All infectious febrile disorders showed marked diminution in mortality, with the exception of hoopingcough, measles, and especially diphtheria. Concerning diphtheria I shall make a few remarks subsequently. Table XIII. gives a summary of the sanitary work done by your sanitary inspectors. We have now thirteen sanitary inspectors or one less than in the year immediately preceding—owing to the appointment of Mr. Shapley to a post under the London County Council. He only left you, however, at the end of October, and indeed the last day on which he officiated as your officer was the last day of that month, and in addition to Mr. Griffiths, whose time is occupied mainly with notifications and matters connected therewith, a shorthand clerk remains in your service, and besides your chief disinfector (Yates) three men are constantly engaged in the work of disinfection which is now a serious part of our duty. It appears from Table XIII. A. that during the year 31,040 primary inspections were made, including 12,843 systematic house-to-house inspections, 3,284 inspections consequent on complaints, 2,185 inspections in respect of notifications of diseases, and 479 inspections of new buildings. It appears also that there were 63,894 re-inspections of works in progress, including the re-inspection of premises in which notifiable diseases were or had been prevailing. It further appears that in connection with the sanitary works revealed by inspection, 5,993 intimations and 1,053 notices were served under the Public Health Act, and that in connection with these only 110 summonses needed to be taken out. Table XIII. B. shows the work which has been done in relation to the supervision and regulation of houses newly built, and those relating to the total or partial reconstruction (under the Vestry's regulations) of the drainage of houses already built. Of partial re-constructions there were 493, and of drainage of new buildings and total reconstructions of drains, &c., of old houses 2,120. Table XIII. C. comprises a list of the ordinary sanitary works which have been carried out, and carried out successfully. The table bears witness to the successful performance of a very large amount of sanitary work, but none of the items call for special remark. Table XIII. D. sets forth the number of samples of food and drugs submitted by the inspectors to the Analyst, and the number of summonses which have been taken out under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. During the year (see Table XIV.) the following notifications of diseases were made: —l6 of small-pox against 140 in the previous year, 946 cases of scarlet fever against 1,886 in the previous year, 740 cases of diphtheria against 526 in the previous year and 312 in the year before that, 336 cases of erysipelas against 440 in the previous year, 129 cases of typhoid fever against 138 in the previous year, 1 case of typhus (which we had good reason for regarding as a case of typhoid fever) and 15 cases of puerperal fever against 23 in the previous year. Also 2 cases were notified as relapsing or continued fever, and none as cases of English cholera. To the above paragraph it may be added that 2,185 cases were notified to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, that 1,913 notifications of infectious diseases, and 1,169 of disinfection after infectious diseases, were made to schools, and that 3,719 notices were served on the occupiers of houses, making the total number of notices served 9,986. As regards other clerical work, 9,140 letters were received and 11,657 sent out. The total number of cases notified to us was 2,185 against 3,166 in the previous year, 2,307 in 1892 and 1,212 in 1891. The only increase as against last year is the notification of diphtheria. The total number of infectious cases removed to hospital was 696 against 725 in 1893. These included 9 cases of small-pox, 411 of scarlet fever, 248 of diphtheria, and 28 of fever. Table XV. gives a list of the number of houses or rooms disinfected by the vestry officials, and of the number of articles disinfected in the parish disinfector or destroyed. Without going into details 1,530 rooms or houses were disinfected and 1,960 lots of bedding and other articles. No compensation for articles damaged or destroyed was allowed. It is gratifying to know that all this work has been done systematically and satisfactorily by your disinfecting staff. 419 TABLE XI.
