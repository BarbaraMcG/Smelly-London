STPAN 30 St. Pancras, Middlesex. EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1873. TO THE VESTRYMEN OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, The Census of 1871 gave to St. Pancras parish a population of 221,465. The average annual increase of population between 1861 and 1871 was 1.1 per cent. Assuming that the same increase of population has been maintained, the population of St. Pancras in the middle of the year 1873 would be 227,000; and this is taken as the population of the parish in 1873, and forms the basis of the calculations in the following Report. In the 53 weeks ending on January 3rd, 1874, 8,095 births were registered in the parish. The number of registered deaths during the 53 weeks ending January 3rd, 1874, was.5,276; and during the year of 365 days, was 5,195. Deducting 79 deaths in the Strand Union Workhouse, and 56 deaths of non-parishioners in the Highgate Infirmary; adding 8 deaths of parishioners in the London Fever Hospital, and in the Homerton Fever Hospital, the actual mortality of parishioners becomes 5,068 in the year of 365 days. The natural increase of population was hence 2,896. The natural increase in 1867 was 2,724 ,, „ 1868 „ 2,915 „ „ 1869 „ 2,594 „ ,,1870 „ 2,301 „ ,,1871 „ 1,912 „ ,, 1872 „ 3,086 „ „ 1873 „ 2,896 The birth-rate was 35.09 per 1,000 persons living. The deaths exceeded by 302 those of the preceding year. The annual rate of mortality was 22.32 per 1,000 persons living. In 1864 the death-rate was 26.03 „ 1865 „ „ 24.80 ,, 1866 „ „ 24.45 „ 1867 „ „ 24.25 „ 1868 „ „ 22.50 „ 1869 „ „ 22.81 „ 1870 „ „ 24.15 „ 1871 „ „ 25.19 „ 1872 „ „ 21.28 „ 1873 „ „ 22.32 The average annual rate of mortality of the ten years 1864-73 was 23.78 per 1,000 persons living. 2 In the metropolis, as a whole, the annual rate of mortality during the year 1873 was 22.50 per 1,000; and in the north district, of which St. Pancras is a part, it was 21.20 per 1000. The death-rate in this parish was hence 0.18 per 1,000 below the metropolitan average, and 1.12 per 1,000 above that of the north registration district. MORTALITY AT VARIOUS AGES. Annual rate of mortality in 1st quarter 22.90 per 1,000 „ „ 2nd „ 20.25 „ „ „ 3rd „ 21.51 „ „ „ 4th „ 27.95 „ An examination of the appended tables will show how largely the increased mortality of the concluding quarter of the year was due to lung affections.

The most prevalent forms of epidemic disease were Hooping Cough during the first half of the year, and Measles during the latter half. It is remarkable that during the quarter preceding the great outbreak of Measles, not a single death was registered in St. Pancras from that disease. Though very prevalent, the Measles were not very fatal in proportion to the number of children attacked. Some schools had to be entirely closed during the course of the epidemic. The facility with which these highly contagious diseases—Hooping Cough, and 8 Measles are spread by means of schools and other places of public resort, renders it very difficult for the Sanitary authorities to exercise any efficient check upon the spread of these maladies; and, I may add, with two inspectors, for a population of 227,000, almost impossible. Nevertheless, by visiting all the houses where the Measles had proved fatal, and by cautioning the parents, and also by visiting the infected schools, some check was put upon their extension. There is nothing that calls for special remark in the mortality from other contagious and infectious diseases. The accompanying tables give details of the mortality from all the chief zymotic diseases. SMALL POX AND VACCINATION. Only two deaths occurred in the parish from Small Pox, and, I believe the cases of this disease were exceedingly few. I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. A. Robertson, the Vaccination Officer, for the appended table relative to Vaccination during the first half year of 1873. I regret that I am unable to give a table for the complete year. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. Your Medical Officer was called upon to give evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons relative to noxious businesses. As my evidence has been made public through a Blue Book, I need not further advert to it. Legislation on the subject is promised during the present Session of Parliament. All the Slaughter-houses in the parish were visited by the Sanitary Committee before the Annual Licensing Day. Many defects were thus brought under the direct notice of the Sanitary Committee. There are 83 licensed Slaughter-houses in St. Pancras Parish. COW SHEDS. The Sanitary Committee also visited all the Cow Sheds previous to the Licensing Day, and this resulted in a manifest improvement iu the condition of many of the sheds. The dispute between the Vestry and the Justices was happily settled by a compromise, after a discussion between the Vestry Clerk, myself, and the J ustices, and 800 cubic feet of space was settled as a minimum. All the licensed cowkeepers signed agreements to observe this regulation; and from the reports of the inspectors the agreement appears, as a rule, to have been pretty generally observed. SANITARY WORKS. A Table is appended, drawn up by the Clerk, giving details of work carried out by the Sanitary Department during the year. GAS SUPPLY. The average illuminating power of the Gas supplied at the 4 testing station by the Imperial Company, as tested by the requirements of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, was 14.7 standard sperm candles. The maximum illuminating power noted was 16.1, and the minimum 130 candles. The average illuminating power was 03 candle above that of the preceding year. Ammonia was always present in the Gas, though never in excess. Sulphuretted hydrogen was never detected. Sulphur was present in amounts ranging from 11.71 to 30.46 grains per 100 cubio feet, the average being 22.42 grains. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, THOS.
