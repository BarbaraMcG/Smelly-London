June, 1953 To the Chairmen and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, In submitting to you this my Annual Report for the year 1952, there are one or two facts which I should like to stress with regard to the statistics shown in the following pages. In the first place, the population of the district has again risen according to the Registrar General's estimate from 69,640 to 71,220 and it is on this figure that the Birth and Death Rates have been calculated. Both the Crude Birth Rate and the Crude Death Rate show a slight decrease from the previous year, but the infantile mortality shows a definite increase, partly owing to the fact that there were more deaths than in 1951 and the Birth Rate has again declined. Owing to the somewhat high incidence of infantile deaths I have set out under this heading a table showing the causes of death in the hopes that it may emphasise the extreme care which is necessary with regard to the new born child especially as regards respiratory diseases. No maternal deaths were recorded. 2 Again this year there was no serious epidemic but the incidence of measles remained extremely high throughout the district and throughout the country. I am glad to report that there have been no cases of Diphtheria, Paratyphoid or Smallpox recorded. There has been a steady rise in the incidence of Infantile Paralysis from 7 to 20. This again was evidenced in the figures for the whole country, namely a rise from 2,613 to 3,902. It is interesting to note that recently the virus of this disease has been found in the house drains connected to those houses where the disease occurred and in consequence our method of dealing with contacts of this disease may need some radical alterations. The inspection of food premises has been rigorously carried out throughout the year and two successful convictions were obtained with regard to foreign bodies found in articles of food. Lectures have been given by my Sanitary Inspectors throughout the year with regard to the work of the Public Health Department, which have proved exceedingly helpful judging by the interest taken in the lectures by the residents of the district. The drinking water supply and private swimming baths have been tested and proved to be satisfactory. Ruislip Lido. Out of 42 samples of water taken for bacteriological investigation, four proved unsatisfactory and in each case these samples were taken after excessive rainfall. The Mass X-Ray Unit did not visit the district in this year owing to extreme pressure of work, but arrangements have been made for the Unit to operate here in 1953. In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Chairman and Councillors for their interest in the work of the department and also to my staff of the Public Health Department for their continued hard work throughout the year. I am, Your obedient Servant, L. D. BAILEY, Medical Officer of Health. 3 Statistics ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 2,088 acres Eastcote Ward 1,231 acres Ruislip Ward 1,757 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,507 acres Total area of district 6,583 acres POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the mid-year :— 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 64,270 66,010 67,090 69,640 71,220 Population Census, 1951 68,274 Number of Inhabited dwellings 20,134 BIRTH RATE 1951 1952 Basis No. of Births Birth Rate No. of Births Birth Rate M.
