To the Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith, in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year 1905. The mortality statistics for the year are again of a very satisfactory character. The Birth Rate of 25.95 per 1,000 is slightly below that of the County of London as a whole, which is 27.1 per 1,000, this latter figure being 2.2 below the decennial average, and in fact, the lowest on record. This rate has been declining for many years, never having been below 30 per 1,000 until the year 1898; the highest rate (35.9 per 1,000) was recorded in 1876. The recorded Death Rate of 13.27 per 1,000 of the estimated population, compares favourably with 15.1 per 1,000, the Death Rate for the County of London, and with 15.7 per 1,000, the figure for the 76 large towns. The County Death Rate was 1.0 per 1,000 below that of 1904 and is thus the lowest on record; and is 2.7 below the decennial average. The Greenwich figure of 13.27 per 1,000, is 1.04 below that in 1904, and l.0l below the average for the last five years. 9 Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to their corrected Death Rate, which is the fairest method of comparison, shows that Greenwich has the lowest Death Rate but four amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs. The four Boroughs having a better Death Rate than Greenwich being Hampstead, Lewisham, Wandsworth and Stoke Newington. Full particulars of all the Boroughs are to be found in the table in Appendix. The Infantile Mortality Rate, measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered, was 119, or a decrease of 23 per 1,000 in the Borough, as compared with the figure for 1904, comparing with 129, the figure for London as a whole, and with 131, the Borough average during the last 5 years. The Zymotic Death Rate of 1.21 per 1,000 is slightly below the County average, viz., l.70 per 1,000, and is 1.02 per 1,000 below the corresponding figure for last year. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows:— Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhœa Death Rate. Consumption Death Rate.

In conclusion, I have again to tender my best thanks to each and all Members of the Council, and the Public Health Committee in particular, for their continued kindness and support, and also to the Members of the Staff for the manner in which their duties have been performed. I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, ERNEST G. ANNIS. 11 VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1905. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the middle of the year is 103,493. This estimate is an increase of 1,842 upon the corresponding figure of last year. The natural increase of the population during the year, or the excess of the number of births over the number of deaths, is 1,308, which therefore allows 534 as the balance of immigrants over emigrants. This estimated population is calculated on the lines indicated in the Annual Report for 1903, the Constant for the year 1905 being 1.0026687. The distribution of the population throughout the Borough is as follows:— Census estimation, 1901. Estimated Population at middle of year 1905. East Greenwich 43,859 47,396 West Greenwich 23,456 25,347 St. Nicholas 7,321 7,912 Charlton 18,065 19,514 Kidbrooke 3,069 3,324 Total 95,770 103,493 MARRIAGES. The Superintendent-Registrar of the Greenwich Union has kindly furnished me with the following particulars relating to the number of marriages solemnised in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent-Registrar for the Woolwich Union has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, with the exception, in these latter 12 ticulars, that none of the marriages performed in the Woolwich Registrar's Office and Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are-included.

The total number of births registered during the year has been 2,678, of which 1,368 were males, and 1,310 females. This gives a birth rate of 25.95 per 1,000 of the population. The birth rate for the County of London equals 27.l per 1,000, and varies from 13.5 in the City of London, 16.2 in Hampstead, 16.8 in the City of Westminster, 19.3 in Kensington, 20.5 in Stoke Newington, and 21.3 in Chelsea, to 32.1 in Poplar, 33.2 in Bethnal Green, 33.3 in Bermondsey, 33.5 in Shoreditch, 34.7 in Finsbury, and 35.3 in Stepney. As most people are aware, the Births and Deaths Registration Acts allow the registration of a birth to be made within the first six weeks after the birth without any undue formalities; a birth may be registered after the expiration of this time, but then certain other formalities have to be gone through. Practically all births 13 are registered within the first six weeks of life, but in view of one's attempts to deal with the prevention of deaths of very young children, it is found that the period which is generally allowed to elapse between the birth of the child and the registration of its birth seriously militates against the success of any scheme for dealing with this question; accordingly, representations have been made from time to time, and continue to be made, with a view to reducing this period; up to the present, however, no alteration has been made. Fortunately, it has been found possible in other ways to obtain earlier information respecting the births of infants, and in this respect the London County Council are deserving of our thanks for the steps they have taken in endeavouring to obtain from all registered Midwives lists of the cases they have attended from week to week, which lists are then abstracted and copies supplied to the Medical Officers of Health of the respective districts in which the Midwives have attended the cases enumerated. In this way, since the beginning of November, I have received intimations from week to week from them respecting births having occurred at 106 different addresses situated in this Borough. Immediately upon the receipt of this information, the circular issued by this Council with respect to Infantile Mortality, and advice as to Infant Feeding is forwarded to each of these addresses, it being hoped that in this way some benefit would be derived both by the parents and the child. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during the period was 1,370, of which 705 were males, and 665 females. The crude death rate for the Borough of 13.27 per 1,000, compares 14 ably with 15.1, the death rate for the County of London, and 15.7 the death rate for the 76 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude death rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 9.3 in Hampstead, 11.7 in Lewisham, 12.6 in Wandsworth, 12.8 in Woolwich, 12.9 in Stoke Newington, 13.27 in Greenwich, 13.3 in Paddington, and 13.5 in the City of Westminster; while the highest rates were 17.5 in Holborn, 17.6 in Poplar, 17.7 in Stepney, 18.5 in Southwark, 18.6 in Bethnal Green, 18.7 in Bermondsey, 19.0 in Finsbury, and 19.7 in Shoreditch. Locally, the death rate varied from 4.23 in Kidbrooke, 12.39 in Charlton, 12.64 in East Greenwich, and 14.41 in West Greenwich, to 19.53 in St. Nicholas. A comparison of the death rates of these different districts for the years 1903, 1904, and 1905 shows that, whereas each district was slightly worse in 1904 than in 1903, in this year (1905), whilst two of the districts, namely, Charlton and St. Nicholas, are worse still, the other three districts, East Greenwich, West Greenwich and Kidbrooke, have improved. The improvement in Kidbrooke was from 4.61 per 1,000 in 1904 to 4.23 per 1,000 in 1905; this latter figure, however, is not so good as 4.03, which was the death rate in 1903. East Greenwich, which had declined from 13.58 in 1903 to 14.71 in 1904, a falling off of 7 per cent., has this year improved to 12.64 per 1,000, an improvement upon last year of 14 per cent., and is, in fact, the lowest death rate recorded in East Greenwich since the formation of the Borough. West Greenwich, which also had declined from 14.96 in 1903 to 15.88 in 1904 has improved during this year to 14.41, being some 9 per cent.; this present death rate in West 15 wich also is lower than it has previously attained since the Borough was formed. Charlton, which had declined from 10.50 in 1903 to 11.56 in 1904 has still further declined to 12.64, which is worse by some 9 per cent, than the previous year. St. Nicholas has again declined to 19.53, being a further 8 per cent. plus the 8 per cent, declension in the previous year; but even this bad death rate is not quite so high as was the case for the first two years of this Council's existence. The death rate in St. Nicholas, viz., 19.53, is considerably higher than the figure, 13.27, for the whole Borough. The following figures well show the variation which occurs in the rate in this district. 1891 24.0 per 1,000 1892 15.5 „ 1893 20.7 „ 1894 25.0 „ 1895 23.3 „ 1896 28.1 „ 1897 25.0 „ 1898 23.6 „ 1899 23.1 „ 1900 18.2 „ 1901 22.8 „ 1902 23.6 „ 1903 22.9 „ 1904 17.9 „ 1905 19.5 „ 21.7 average for 5 years. 23.6 „ „ 21.3 „ „ The age mortality and the distribution of the deaths between the different quarters of the year is shewn by the following table:— Age Mortality.

The Infantile Mortality, recorded by the deaths of children under one year of age to the number of births registered, was 119 per 1,000 births, there having been a total of 318 such deaths during the year, as compared with 373, the figure for the previous year, showing a decrease of 55 actual deaths. The number for the County of London was 129 per 1,000 births. The lowest rates of Infantile Mortality amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs were 88 per 1,000 births in S. Marylebone, 92 in Holborn and in Lewisham, 94 in Hampstead, and 102 in Woolwich, whilst the highest were 148 in Southwark and in Bermondsey, 149 in the City of London, 151 in Bethnal Green, 153 in Poplar, and 167 in Shoreditch. Locally the variations were from 102 per 1,000 births in Charlton, 111 in East Greenwich, 114 in West Greenwich, up to 162 in St. Nicholas. An important Conference respecting Infantile Mortality was convened by the St. Pancras Borough Council, which your Medical Officer of Health had the pleasure of attending, when the following Resolutions were agreed to:— (a) That it is desirable that every encouragement should be given to prospective mothers to seek advice as to the management of their health, so that they may endow their offspring with good constitutions, and prepare themselves to suckle their infants when born. (b) That it is desirable that all efforts should be exhausted upon improving the health of suckling mothers before devoting attention solely to their infants. 19 (c) That it is desirable that births should be registered within five days of their occurrence, as is required in the case of death by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, and be not delayed for six weeks and longer as now by law permitted. (d) That it is desirable that the Municipal Authority should send to the addresses of all mothers, furnished in the weekly returns, cards or leaflets of advice, laying greatest stress upon the improvement of antenatal conditions, on the "preparation for, and maintenance of breast feeding of infants during the first nine months of life, and strongly advising mothers not to wean their infants prematurely, except upon medical advice. (e) That it is desirable that Women Inspectors should be appointed with a view to the prevention of Infantile Mortality by selecting from the weekly returns suitable cases amongst the poor for enquiry, affording general information in the Hygiene of Nursing, and directing the necessitous poor where to apply for such advice and assistance as may be urgently required in order to maintain breast feeding. (f) That it is desirable that Medical Practitioners, Midwives, and Nurses, the Staffs of Hospitals and Dispensaries, and the religious, charitable and social organisations should co-operate with the Municipal Authority in endeavouring to encourage breast feeding, and to diminish the Infantile Mortality. (g) That it is desirable that the information should be spread broadcast that breast feeding is the most ecomomical, easy, and safe mode of feeding infants under nine months of age, with a view to reducing the number of hand-fed sucklings to the smallest proportion possible. 20 (h) That it is desirable that mothers should be urged not to wean their infants until the ninth month of age, except upon Medical advice. (i) That it is desirable that mothers should be warned that the hand-feeding of infants is expensive, troublesome, and unsatisfactory, risky at all times, and in summer dangerous, and often fatal. (j) That with a view not to encourage premature weaning, it is desirable that milk for the hand-feeding of infants provided privately or publicly by milk depots, at or below cost, should be distributed upon the orders of Medical Practitioners. (k) That, having reduced the number of sucklings required to be hand-fed to the smallest proportion possible, means should be devised for providing suitable milk for the remainder. (I) That it is desirable that cow's milk intended for handfed infants should be milked, transported, and distributed under special precautions. (m) That, in order to prevent the pollution of infants' milk in distribution and in the home, it is desirable that it should be protected in stoppered bottles, ready for feeding, and not be transferred to other bottles. (n) That the provision of cow's milk, produced under asceptic conditions, accompanied by extreme cleanliness, refrigeration and dispatch, so diluted and enriched, and put up in stoppered bottles in such quantities to be administered at specified intervals for suckling infants, should be regarded not only as ordinary food, but in the nature of medical assistance. From the tenor of these Resolutions which were almost in all cases passed unanimously, it will be readily seen how wide was 21 the range of subjects considered, and 1 think that no one, who has the welfare of the infants at heart, can find fault with the opinions expressed therein. AN ANALYSIS OF DEATH CAUSES. All death causes are conveniently arranged under various headings, and the following table, a summary of the larger tables, in the Appendix, shows the death rates for residents, and in fact all persons belonging to the Borough, although some of them may have died in Institutions in other Boroughs, or even outside the County of London altogether, per 1,000 of the population living in the Borough, according to the Registrar-General's classification of diseases. 1905.

Infective Diseases. Epidemic. The deaths due to this class of diseases have been 154, equalling a death rate of 1.49 per 1,000, compared with 246 the total deaths, and 2.43 the death rate, for the corresponding diseases last year. The Zymotic Death Rate for the County of London equals 1.70 per 1,000, wherein it varied from 0.53 in Hampstead, 0.57 in the City of London, 0.81 in the City of Westminster, 0.95 in Lewisham, l.02 in Woolwich, and 1.03 in Chelsea, up to 2.21 in Bermondsey, 2.27 in Bethnal Green, 2.39 in Southwark, 2.58 in Stepney, 2.65 in Poplar, 2.71 in Fulham, and 2.96 in Shoreditch. Locally the total Zymotic Death Rate varied from nil in Kidbrooke (nil 1904), 0.77 in Charlton (1.46 in 1904), 1.27 in East Greenwich and in West Greenwich (2.59 and 1.93 respectively in 1904), to 1.90 in St. Nicholas, Deptford (4.00 in 1904), from which it will be seen that each District, has participated in this improvement. Small-pox. During the year there have been no deaths from this disease. Measles. This disease has proved fatal in 18 cases, 17 of them being in children under five years of age. There were 40 deaths due to this complaint in 1904 and 25 in 1903. The distribution of these Measles fatalities was as follows:—3 in St. Nicholas, 6 in East Greenwich, and 9 in West Greenwich. Scarlet Fever. This disease is credited with a total of only 5 deaths during the year, 1 in East Greenwich, and 4 in West Greenwich. 22 a. (22B) DEATHS FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES, 1905. * Diarrhœa. o Scarlet Fever * Diphtheria. • Enteric Fever. o Whooping Cough 23 Diphtheria. This disease has been the cause of 15 fatalities, giving a death rate of 0·14 per 1,000; 9 of these deaths were in patients under five years of age. There were 12 such fatalities in 1904, and 27 in 1903. The local distribution was 1 in St. Nicholas, Deptford, 3 in West Greenwich, 5 in East Greenwich, and 6 in Charlton. Twelve of the patients died in the Brook Hospital, the remaining 3 being under treatment in their own homes. There was a further number of 33 deaths rom Diphtheria occurring amongst patients not resident in this Borough, but under treatment at the Brook Hospital. Twenty-one tubes of Diphtheria Anti-toxin, containing a total of 84,000 units of serum, for the treatment of patients suffering from this disease, have been supplied by this Council during the year. Whooping Cough. This has been the cause of 14 deaths, comparing with 54 and 37 respectively in the two preceding years, and giving a rate of 0·13 per 1,000. Nine of these deaths were in East Greenwich, and 5 in West Greenwich. Typhoid Fever. This disease has been the cause of 5 deaths in the Borough during the year, comparing with 8 such deaths in 1904, and only 1 in 1903. Two of these deaths occurred in patients belonging to East Greenwich, and 1 each in West Greenwich, St. Nicholas, and Charlton. In two of the fatal cases the patients were being treated in public institutions. Diarrhiœa. This disease has occasioned 64 deaths, equalling a death rate of 0·62 per 1,000, comparing with 109 and 67 deaths respectively in the two preceding years. Thirty-seven of these deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 9 in West Greenwich, 10 in 24 St. Nicholas, and 8 in Charlton. of the 37 deaths in East Greenwich, 35 were in children under five years of age; of the 9 in West Greenwich, 8 were under five years of age; of the 10 in St. Nicholas, 9 were under five years of age: and of the 8 in Charlton, 6 were under five years of age. Epidemic or Zymotic Enteritis, which is a disease very closely allied to Diarrhœa, was the cause of 17 deaths, all of them being in children under five years of age. I can only here again reiterate the remarks made last year, to the effect that more frequent cleansing of the surfaces of the yards, courts, and alleys in the poorer districts, together with a more thorough flushing and cleansing of the drainage systems connected with this class of property, should be carried out; especially is this necessary in the warmer months of the year, for, generally speaking, we may consider that these young children do not go far from their homes, and, therefore, the more cleanly their surroundings can be kept the better for the children concerned. This added cleanliness would also have the effect of materially reducing the sources of contamination of the food supplied to these children, for undoubtedly, in the majority of cases, their fatal ailment is contracted through contaminated food supplies. Influenza. Influenza has occasioned 16 deaths throughout the Borough during the year, comparing with 18 during the previous year, and 14 in 1903. Sporadic. Tetanus. One death has been ascribed to this disease during the year, in a patient under 5 years of age. Venereal. Syphilis. This disease has been ascribed as the cause of 5 deaths during the year, 4 being in children under five years of age, and 1 over that age. 25 Septic. Erysipelas. This was the cause of 5 deaths during the year, 2 being in patients under five years of age. Puerperal Fever. Puerperal Fever was the cause of 4 deaths during the year, compared with only 1 in 1904. Some reference to these deaths will be found in connection with the remarks on notifications of this disease. Pyæmia and Septicæmia. Caused 2 deaths. Infective Endocarditis. Is credited with 1 death. Malarial. Rheumatic Fever. This disease is credited with 3 deaths during the year, while Rheumatism of the Heart caused 2 deaths. Tuberculosis. This class of disease has occasioned 185 deaths during the year, with a death rate of 1·79 per 1,000, comparing with 169 deaths and a death rate of 1·67 per 1,000 during the previous year. Consumption is credited with by far the largest proportion of this number, viz., 135 deaths, or a death rate of 1·31 per 1,000, comparing with 1·42 the Consumption death rate for the whole of London. Amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs the Consumption death rate ranged from 0·83 in Hampstead, 0·85 in Lewisham, 0·96 in Paddington, 1·02 in Wandsworth, and 1·14 in Kensington, to 1·79 in Bermondsey, 1·96 in Shoreditch, 2·02 in Finsbury, 2·04 in Bethnal Green, 2·13 in Southwark, and 2·84 in Holborn. Locally, the deaths were 3 in Kidbrooke, giving a death rate of 0·91 per 1,000; 14 in St. Nicholas, giving a death rate of 1·77; 27 in Charlton, giving a death rate of 1·39; 39 in West Greenwich, giving a death rate of 1·54; and 52 in East Greenwich, giving a death rate of 1·10 per 1,000. 26 The remaining forms of Tuberculosis were credited with 50 deaths, 18 being in East Greenwich, 12 in West Greenwich, 12 in St. Nicholas, 7 in Charlton and 1 in Kidbrooke. of these other forms of Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of the Brain, or its Membrane, was credited with 25 deaths; Tubercle affecting the intestines, 8 (4 being in patients under five years); General Tuberculosis, 10 deaths (3 being in patients under five years of age); and the other forms of Tuberculosis, 7 deaths. Voluntary notifications of cases of Consumption were received to the number of 109 during the year, which, by comparison with the number received during the preceding years, namely, 123, 59 and 51, shows that medical men in the District are still appreciating this arrangement. Forty-four of these notifications were respecting patients residing in East Greenwich, 37 in West Greenwich, 20 in St. Nicholas, and 8 in Charlton. Dietic Diseases. This class of disease is credited with a total of 7 deaths, giving a rate of 0·07 per 1,000. These deaths were all due to Alcoholism, acute or chronic. Constitutional Diseases. These are credited with 120 deaths, giving a death rate of 1.16 per 1,000. One was attributed to Gout, 16 to Diabetes, 6 to Anæmia of various forms, and 91 to Cancer. The deaths from Cancer were distributed as follows: 34 in East Greenwich, 27 in West Greenwich, 6 in St. Nicholas, 19 in Charlton, and 5 in Kidbrooke. The enquiries which have been carried out during the past few years with a view to, if possible, determining any apparently predisposing cause, have been discontinued, as up to the present no sufficient good appears to have resulted from the enquiry to 27 compensate for the trouble and expense occasioned, moreover the whole tendency of present-day research seems to point in an entirely different direction and having nothing whatever to do with housing conditions or habits of the patient. Developmental Diseases. This class of disease is credited with 261 deaths, equalling a rate of 2·53 per 1,000, this number being distributed as follows:— Atelectasis 5, Congenital Defects 9, which causes of death amongst this class would appear to begenerally the unavoidable ones. The next subdivision of this developmental class might be described as the ideal cause of death, viz.. Old Age or Senile Decay, which was ascribed as the actual cause in 133 cases. The remaining number, which forms a large proportion, we find to be due to causes which, in a greater or less degree, are preventable. Premature Birth, to which was ascribed 55 deaths; Debility at Birth, 5; Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus, 39; Dentition, 11; and Rickets, 4 ; making a total of 114. Local Diseases. Nervous System. This class of disease is credited with having caused 123 deaths, giving a death rate of 1·19 per 1,000. Of this number 25 were ascribed to Convulsions, all of them being in young children. Meningitis is credited with having caused 11 deaths; Apoplexy, 45; Softening of the Brain, 5; Brain Paralysis, 5; General Paralysis, 6; other forms of Insanity, 6; Cerebral Tumour, 2; Epilepsy, 4; Diseases of the Spinal Cord, 7; and other diseases of the Brain and Nervous System, 6. Circulatory System. This class of disease is credited with having occasioned 122 deaths, 103 of this number being 28 ascribed to Valvular Diseases of the Heart. The death rate of diseases of the circulatory system equals 1·18 per 1,000. Respiratory System. This class of disease is credited with 201 deaths, giving a death rate of 1·95 per 1,000. Of this number, 27 were ascribed to Acute Bronchitis, 21 of the cases being in children under 5 years of age; 63 to Chronic Bronchitis; 99 to Pneumonia, 51 of which were in children under 5 years of age; and other diseases of the Respiratory System, 12 deaths. Digestive System. This class of disease is credited as the cause of 56 deaths ; Enteritis being credited with 13, 11 being in children under 5 years of age; Obstruction of the Bowels, 11; Appendicitis, 4; Cirrhosis of the Liver, 13; Peritonitis, 4; and the remaining diseases of this system, 11. The death rate from diseases of this System was 0·54 per 1,000. Urinary System. Forty-eight deaths were ascribed to this class of disease, 34 of these being due to Bright's Disease. Reproductive System. Three deaths were ascribed to be due to diseases of generative organs, and 7 to various conditions attendant upon, and complicating, the parturient condition. External Causes. Accidents or negligence in various ways have been ascribed as the cause of death in 41 cases, 6 of which were in very young children who had been suffocated by being overlain by their parents in bed. Drowning was the cause of death in 7 cases; Suffocation, otherwise than being overlain in bed, 2 cases; falls, accidents on railways, in building operations, in vehicular traffic, &c., 19; whilst burns, scalds and poisons also occasioned 7 deaths; Homicide was given as the cause of 1 death; Suicide was ascribed as the cause of death in 8 cases. 29 MORTUARY. The number of bodies dealt with in St. Alphege Mortuary since 1896, is shewn below:— Year. Drowned bodies from River. Other bodies. Totals. 1896 11 33 44 1897 11 47 58 1898 15 32 47 1899 17 45 62 1900 7 66 73 1901 13 126 139 1902 13 95 108 1903 20 118 138 1904 15 155 170 1905 10 137 147 During the year ended 31st December, 1904, which is the most recent year for which these returns from the London County Council are available, the Coroner for the South-Eastern District of London held 177 Inquests in Greenwich, 155 of these being at the Coroner's Court, adjoining the Mortuary, and 22 at other public places. The death of the person whose body formed the subject of the enquiry occurred in a Hospital in 25 cases, in a private house in 86 cases, in other places 66 cases, and it was found necessary to have a post-mortem examination made in 90 cases, but this number does not include post-mortem examinations made at Hospitals. During the year the Council have adopted a series of By-laws and Regulations with respect to the Management of the Mortuary. These By-laws were duly allowed by the Local Government Board on the 7 th March, 1905. The question of the duties of Mortuary Keeper has been considered from time to time, but it was thought that it was undesirable at the present time to specifically lay down any list of duties for the present Mortuary Keeper. 30 Notifications under the Provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. There have been notified a total of 671 cases under the above Act, as compared with 890 cases in the previous year. Small-pox. Only four cases of this disease were notified throughout the year in persons residing in this Borough. The first case was in the person of an adult male residing in the neighbourhood of Coldbath Street. He had been vaccinated in infancy, suffered from a mild attack, and made a good recovery. No definite source of infection was found, the patient himself thought that he contracted the disease by coming into contact with sacks which had contained corn brought from India; no corroboration of this could be made out. The second case occurred in the person of an adult female residing in the North-West Ward. She had been vaccinated in infancy, suffered from a mild attack, and made a good recovery. No definite source of infection was found in this case. The third case occurred in the person of an adult male, residing in the North Ward. He was a Contractor's Agent, engaged on Railway Works on the West Coast of Africa, and returned in the R.M.S. "Nile," on which steamer a case of Small-pox occurred during the voyage. On the steamship's arrival at Southampton, and in answer to the inspecting Medical Officer's enquiries, the patient gave an incorrect address, and accordingly when the Port Medical Officer of Health notified the Medical Officer of Health of the District in which this address was situated, they were unable to find the individual indicated and we, into whose District he actually came, had no knowledge (30 A) Shewing the Number of Cases of these Diseases notified during each week throughout the year 1905. 30b) Shewing the Number of Cases of these Diseases notified during each week throughout the year 1905. 31 of this possible centre of infection as we should have had, had the address been correctly given, our first intimation being that the patient was suffering from the disease. Fortunately we were able to obtain the prompt revaccination of all persons who had been in contact with this patient, and no spread of the disease occurred. A case of this character only shows the necessity for some penalty to attach to persons who knowingly give false addresses in this way, for it is quite conceivable that had this case not been promptly notified by the Medical Attendant of the patient, a serious spread of the disease might readily have occurred. The fourth case occurred in the person of an adult female from the Charlton district, who was being treated in the Plumstead Infirmary. In this case, however, the diagnosis of Small-pox was not confirmed by the Medical Officer to the Asylums Board, and the patient was returned. All these patients were treated at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals and made a satisfactory recovery. The Vaccination Officer for the Greenwich Union has again very kindly supplied me with the usual particulars respecting the vaccination of children whose births were registered in his portion of this Borough up to June, 1905, which returns, I am sure, must be considered to be of a most satisfactory character and highly creditable to the Officer concerned, for in the Parish of Greenwich for the year 1904, after allowing for the cases of removal and cases not found, there appears to be only one defaulter, and in the return for the first half of 1905, after allowing similarly, only two defaulters. 32 Return for the period July to December, 1904.

One hundred and forty-four cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, as compared with 150 and 207, respectively, in the two previous years. The distribution of these cases was as follows:—65 in East Greenwich, 35 in West Greenwich, 10 in St. Nicholas, 32 in Charlton, and 2 in Kidbrooke. Of this total number 120 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 15 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 6 per cent. One hundred and nineteen specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 88 were reported to give negative results and 31 positive. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1905 has been as follows:— 1st Quarter—East Greenwich, 14 cases; West Greenwich, 7; it. Nicholas, 3; Charlton, 9; a total of 33 cases. 2nd Quarter—East Greenwich and West Greenwich, 7 cases each; Charlton, 5; St. Nicholas and Kidbrooke, 2 cases each; a total of 23 cases. 3 rd Quarter—East Greenwich, 11 cases; West Greenwich, 9; St Nicholas, 4; Charlton, 3; a total of 27 cases. 4th Quarter—East Greenwich, 33 cases; West Greenwich, 12; Charlton, 15; St. Nicholas, 1; a total of 61 cases. From which it will be seen that there was a marked increase in the incidence of this disease in the East Greenwich and 36 Charlton districts during the fourth quarter of the year. Unfortunately, several scholars attending one of the County Council Schools in this neighbourhood were allowed to continue in attendance at the School whilst in an infectious condition, and this gave rise to a large number of cases amongst other scholars attending the School. It may be pointed out that these cases were all of a very mild character, and in the majority of instances showed very little clinical evidence, the patients not complaining of any illness beyond a slight sore throat, and it was only after a consideration of all the facts when seeking for the cause of the increased incidence of this disease, and on having bacteriological examinations made of children actually in attendance at the School, that this condition of things was revealed. Arrangements were then made with the Education Department of the London County Council to the effect that they should make periodical examinations of the children in the School, excluding all those who gave positive and also suspicious bacteriological results; and, on the other hand, that this Council should make themselves responsible for the examination of the children previous to their readmission to School; in this way the outbreak has been at length successfully combated. Great difficulty has been experienced in deciding as to what was the best course to take with a view to the isolation and treatment of these cases of bacteriological Diphtheria which showed no clinical signs, and in the early part of the outbreak it was considered sufficient if these children were isolated in their own homes, and a medical man called in should, at any time, treatment appear to become necessary. This plan, however, failed to achieve the object we had in view, for other cases of actual 37 clinical Diphtheria occurred in some of the houses, presumably, and, in fact, in all probability, having arisen from the earlier very mild cases; some of these later cases were attended with fatal results. Accordingly, it was decided to require strict isolation and treatment wherever the Diphtheria bacillus was found. During the first quarter of the present year some 490 children have been examined previous to their readmission to School, such children being considered by their parents or other guardians, and in some cases, by their Medical Attendant, to be fit for school attendance, and amongst these children there have been found to be 47 definite cases where the Diphtheria bacillus was present in the throat as well as 20 cases of a similarly suspicious nature, also one case of Scarlet Fever and 4 suspicious cases. In view of this condition of things the constant outbreaks of Diphtheria and allied diseases which cannot be definitely traced would appear to be of easy explanation. of course, in the cases where the Diphtheria bacillus was definitely revealed isolation and treatment were insisted upon, and the children were not allowed to return to School until a definite negative result was obtained from further bacteriological examination. During the year, nine cases which were notified as Diphtheria, and removed to the Hospital, were returned home after periods of time varying from a few days up to several weeks as not suffering from Diphtheria; of these patients six were stated to be suffering from Tonsillitis, and one each from Syphilis and Measles, the other case having no definite illness stated. Erysipelas. Eighty-eight cases were notified during the year, 29 being in East Greenwich, 31 in West Greenwich, 17 in 38 St. Nicholas, 10 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Eight of the patients were under treatment in Public Institutions in the district. Scarlet Fever.—Two hundred and eighty-eight cases of this disease were notified during the year, as compared with 214 and 164 cases, respectively, in the two preceding years; 117 cases were in East Greenwich, 91 in West Greenwich, 19 in St. Nicholas, 47 in Charlton, and 14 in Kidbrooke; 243 of these cases were removed to the hospital for treatment. There were only 5 deaths from this disease during the year. Four of the cases removed to the hospital as suffering from Scarlet Fever were returned as wrongly diagnosed; 3 were stated to be suffering from Erythema and 1 from Measles. The following are the particulars of the 12 cases which would appear to be strictly within the meaning of the term "return cases." This is a very much larger number than occurred during the previous year, when only 3 cases were so described. In this connection, one realises the very great difficulty experienced by the Hospital Authorities in ensuring that the patients, at the time of their discharge, and immediately afterwards, should not be, nor become, infecting agents; for a child who has had some oral or nasal discharge whilst in the hospital may have had such complication cured, and be actually, at the time of the discharge, in a non-infectious condition, but after returning home, and when some few days or weeks have elapsed, may contract a cold which again sets up the oral or nasal discharge of an infectious character. Some patients have been kept in the hospital for as long as eleven weeks or so, on account of one or other of these conditions, and yet shortly after discharge the condition has reappeared; in some cases this having been thought to be the origin of the return case. 39 Table shewing Return Cases of Scarlet Fever during Year 1905.

There were 28 cases of Typhoid Fever notified during the year, 15 being in East Greenwich, 5 in West Greenwich, 4 in St. Nicholas, 2 in Charlton, and 2 in Kidbrooke. The ages of the patients were: 2 between one and five years, 6 between five and fifteen years, 13 between fifteen and twenty-five years, and 7 between twenty-five and sixty-five years. Of the total number of cases, 21 were removed to the hospital for treatment. There were 5 fatalities from this disease during the year, 2 belonging to East Greenwich, and 1 each in West Greenwich, St. Nicholas, and Charlton. Twenty-nine specimens were forwarded for bacteriological examination from cases suspected to be Typhoid Fever in character, and of this number 21 gave a negative result, 2 were of a doubtful character, and 6 positive. Four cases which were notified and removed to the hospital, presumably suffering from this disease, were considered by the authorities in charge there not to be suffering from such disease, one each being diagnosed as suffering from the varying complaints: Pylephlebitis (inflammation of the Portal Vein), Gastritis. Lobar Pneumonia, and General Meningitis. Enquiries have again been made in connection with each case notified as to any possible source of infection, and there does not appear to have been any one source acting generally throughout the whole of the year, the number of cases being spread over the whole of the twelve months. In one case it was thought that the disease was contracted from swimming in the polluted water of the Thames, and in another case by eating ice-cream; the premises, however, where this latter commodity was manufactured, were visited and examined, when they were found to be in good condition. The following six patients gave a definite history of having partaken of some kind of fish or oysters, and it was thought that the ailment might have been contracted in this way. 41 Fish and Enteric Fever.

Six cases of this disease were notified during the year, 4 being in East Greenwich, and 1 each in West Greenwich and St. Nicholas. Two of the cases were treated in hospital. There were 4 deaths from this disease during the year, 2 being in East Greenwich, and 1 each in West Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The two fatalities in East Greenwich appeared, unfortunately, to have a common origin, one of the midwives practising in this neighbourhood being in attendance upon a patient suffering from this disease, and, apparently, having carried the disease unwittingly to others of her patients. During the time that elapsed between the midwife's attendance upon the first puerperal patient and the time the medical man who diagnosed the actual condition from which the patient was suffering was called in to that patient, the midwife concerned attended some 20 other cases, 3 of whom contracted Puerperal Fever, 2 with fatal results. The Coroner for this district deemed it advisable to hold inquests in these two fatal cases, and cautioned the midwife as to her future conduct. The house and clothing of the midwife were thoroughly disinfected. She was required by your Medical Officer to discontinue her practice for a time, and, in fact, went entirely away from the district for a period, and no further similar cases have occurred in connection with her practice. In one other case the patient was attended by a midwife who likewise was required to have her clothing thoroughly disinfected and cleansed, and to discontinue her work for a period of two weeks. 43 The Public Health Committee, when considering this series of cases, thought that the rules governing the procedure of midwives required amendment in certain particulars, and forwarded their suggestions to the London County Council, who are the supervising authority in this district, for their further consideration. Chicken-pox. The notification of this disease was not in force during 1905 in Greenwich. Measles. Seven hundred and sixty-eight cases of this disease were notified by parents, guardians, school teachers and others during the year, and in each case visits were paid to the infected premises, and the usual measures of disinfection generally carried out. There were 18 cases of Measles which proved fatal. The number of actual cases of Measles heard of is some 35 per cent, less than the total number of the previous year, whilst the number of fatalities is 55 per cent, less, hence it would appear as if the virulence of the disease during the year had been considerably less than the previous year.

It is always kept clean, aired, and in readiness for the reception of persons; but in the absence of any serious outbreak it does not appear to have been required. Contacts. Information still continues to be received from time to time from the various Port and other Sanitary Authorities respecting persons coming into this district who have been in contact with infectious cases. This has principally been in connection with Transports bringing home soldiers, and the disease chiefly concerned, Small-pox; seven such contacts were notified from Gosport, six from Southampton, and five from the Port of London, whilst one Plague contact was reported from Leith Each of these persons has been kept under observation, but in no instance has illness developed. The solitary case of a contact who did develop the illness, but of whose arrival we had not been advised because he gave a wrong address to the Port Authorities, has been dealt with in an earlier part of this Report. Information has been received during the year as to a patient suffering from Leprosy who has come to reside in the district. This person has also been kept under observation. Consumption. During the year there were 109 cases of Consumption voluntarily notified, 44 being in East Greenwich, 37 in West Greenwich, 20 in St. Nicholas, and 8 in Charlton. Of this number 13 cases were under treatment in an Institution. The ages of the patients were 2 under 1 year of age, 1 between 1 and 5 years, 9 between 5 and 15 years, 19 between 15 and 25, 76 between 25 and 65 years, and 2 over 65 years. 46 In each of these cases, except when otherwise desired by the Medical Attendant, enquiries are made and literature and personal advice bearing upon the subject are given to the patient, or the patient's friends; it is hoped that in this way the public are being gradually educated in the matter. Sixteen specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be consumptive, but all were reported on negatively. Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 56 cases; 336 bottles of disinfectants have been supplied to disinfect the sputum in these cases.

The Sanitary work of the Department shows that a total of 16,327 houses and premises have been inspected or re-inspected during the year; 1,573 intimation notices have been served, and 236 statutory notices, whilst it was only found necessary to issue summonses and thus institute magisterial proceedings in seven cases. There were altogether throughout the year 253 complaints entered in the Public Complaint Register of the Department. Bakehouses. One hundred and forty-three inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 42 nuisances therein have been abated. The occupier of one underground bakehouse was prosecuted during the year for occupying and using the same without having obtained a certificate as to the fitness of the premises for use as a bakehouse as required by the Factory and Workshop Act. The case was adjourned from time to time to allow the occupier to have the bakehouse put in thorough order, and when the work was satisfactorily completed the necessary certificate was issued by this Council, and the proceedings withdrawn. The whole of the underground bakehouses now have the necessary certificates; the remaining one which had no certificate, but was in use at the end of 1904, being now out of use, as large and substantial premises have been built above ground. In the case of several of the bakehouses situated above ground, it has been found possible to obtain considerable improvements on lines very similar to those adopted with reference to underground bakehouses, and it is hoped that the whole of this class of premises within the Borough will eventually be improved 51 in this way. It would, however, be of much assistance in the matter if there were definite legal enactments applying to the bakehouses above ground those provisions of the underground bakehouse requirements which might be applicable. Factories and Workshops. Seven hundred and twenty inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 321 Workshop premises on the Register at the beginning of the year, 11 have been added during the year, and 85 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 247, of which number 238 have now been properly measured up. This total number includes 20 laundries, 43 dressmakers, 8 fuel and firewood works, 4 cycle works, 8 milliners, and various others, including 26 workplaces, such as blacksmiths, barge builders, builders' yards, &c. Information has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories with respect to 2 new workshops, 1 new factory, and 15 instances of young persons or females being employed on premises where no Abstract is displayed. Five complaints have been received from H.M. Inspector. One prosecution was made under section 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, for illegal occupation of an underground bakehouse. The inspections made revealed the presence of defects or insanitary conditions requiring the service of 76 written notices, 61 of these being in respect of workshops, including workshop laundries, 5 in respect of workplaces, and 2 in respect of factories, including factory laundries, and 8 with reference to homeworkers' premises. The notices had reference to want of cleanliness generally in 76 cases, want of ventilation in 2 cases, overcrowding 52 in 2 cases, insufficient sanitary accommodation 2 cases, unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation 16 cases, and other nuisances 20 cases. The majority of these defects have been attended to. Outworkers' Register. Seventy-three lists of Outworkers, containing 125 names, have been received during the year from Medical Officers of Health for other Districts; 25 lists, containing 224 names, have been received from employers within the District; 23 lists, containing 95 names, have been forwarded to other Districts, thus giving a total of 254 names and addresses of outworkers within the Borough. These premises have all been inspected from time to time, and insanitary conditions requiring the service of written notices have been revealed in 8 cases.

The six slaughter-houses in the Borough have been inspected on 24 occasions by the Inspectors, when any insanitary conditions noticed have speedily received attention. The majority of these slaughter-houses are now only very occasionally used, just sufficient in fact to keep the licenses in force. 55 Cowhouses. The four cowhouses in the Borough have been visited on 12 occasions, and the necessary attention has been given to their periodical cleansing. Horse Slaughterer. The one horse-slaughtering house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector 30 times. Other Scheduled Offensive Trades. The 63 other premises where these offensive trades are in operation have been visited occasionally. As, however, the majority of these are situated within the precincts of the City Corporation's Cattle Market at Deptford, these premises are not visited so frequently as if they were not so situated. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. At the commencement of the year, there were 190 premises on the Register of Dairies and Milkshops; 35 new applications have been received during the year and added to the Register, while 10 names have been taken off, thus leaving a total of 215 premises now registered. During the year 258 visits of inspection have been paid to these premises; notices were served upon the occupiers in 10 cases, 3 of which were for dirty premises generally, and 7 cases for dirty milk vessels and utensils. Ice Cream Premises. There were 116 premises known at the commencement of the year where the manufacture of this commodity was carried on, 20 have been added during the year and 29 taken off, leaving a total of 107 premises. These premises 1were inspected on 143 occasions, and in 20 cases cleansing or other improvement has been found to be necessary. 56 Other places where food is prepared have been visited on 219 occasions, improvements being required in 81 cases. One very glaring case of food being prepared under grossly insanitary conditions was brought to light during the year ; the kitchen of a well-known Restaurant was found to have direct connection with the sewer; the w.c., situated in the room directly above the kitchen, allowed considerable leakage through on to the kitchen floor, so much so that a receptacle stood continually there to receive the leakage ; the walls and ceilings, the sinks, larders, and in fact the premises generally being deplorably dirty—really in a filthy condition. These matters have, however, all been remedied, and at the time of writing this Report the whole of the premises have been brought into a thoroughly up-to-date and model sanitary condition. Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. Application was received during the year for certificates under these Acts with respect to 25 tenements. When first made the application was refused for certain suggested works to be carried out, these requirements having been complied with, on a further application the necessary certificates were granted for each of these premises. House-to-House Inspection. This regular inspection was continued during the early months of the year, until the whole of the North Ward had been inspected, when the services of the Inspector specially charged with this work were discontinued. A resume of the results of this inspection of the remaining portion of the North Ward is shown in the following tabular statements. 57 Résumé of House-to-House Inspection Results.—Houses, Rooms, Defects.

In accordance with the request of the London County Council, arrangements were made during the year to carry out a census of this character, and it is very gratifying to find that no people were discovered to be sleeping out in any part of the Borough on the night in question, i.e., February 17th. In order, however, to make sure that this was not an unusual state of things on that night only, arrangements were made with the Police that they should quietly make similar observations for the whole of the week just preceding and succeeding the date named, and they also could not report the finding of any such cases. Housing of the Working Classes. The Greenwich Market area, which has been receiving attention from time to time both at the hands of this Council and the Admiralty Authorities, is now being thoroughly transformed, much of the old property being pulled down and replaced by shops and other modern premises. Premises have been found to be overcrowded in 15 cases, which have all been abated, and in five cases the illegal use of underground rooms has been discontinued. Five hundred and thirty-six houses have been generally repaired; 372 premises have been cleansed, limewashed, and repaired; 55 have been improved as regards their ventilation; 208 premises have had the walls and ceilings cleansed throughout, and 248 premises have been partially cleansed; leaky house roofs and gutters have been repaired in 375 cases; nuisances from dampness have been abated in 173 cases; direct connection between the internal sanitary fittings of houses and the sewer have been disconnected, trapped and amended in 312 cases; similarly 213 stack pipes have been 62 connected, trapped and amended; 26 houses have been abolished as unfit for habitation; and want of underfloor ventilation has also been attended to. Houses Let in Lodgings. As indicated in the last Annual Report, no special work has been carried out under these By-laws during the year, on account of the inadequacy of the present staff. House Drainage. Three hundred and eleven house drainage systems have been reconstructed or repaired; 277 such systems have also been opened, cleansed and amended; 76 new systems and 475 surface drains have been constructed; 165 systems have been tested by smoke and 429 by water, of which number 283 were found to be defective; 135 new soil pipes and 764 traps have been fixed, together with 141 intercepting chambers, with or without fresh air inlets as was necessary. Fourteen cesspools have been abolished; 178 areas, 158 yards and 11 mews and stables have been thoroughly drained. Sixty-seven water closets and 9 urinals have been erected; a pan, trap and water supply have been furnished throughout in 386 cases, and other fittings in 423 cases, whilst the water supply has been renewed in 174 instances. The water supply for lavatory purposes has been disconnected from the drinking-water system in 144 instances. Eighty-nine public-house urinals have been cleansed and repaired, together with alterations to 2 other urinals, whilst a water supply has been laid on or repaired at 12 such conveniences. Sewerage. Complaints have again been fairly numerous, particularly during the warmer months of the year, with respect to the offensive emanations from the London County Council Main Sewer passing through this District, and it has been thought by some that the outbreak of Diphtheria, which has been 63 tioned in an earlier part of this Report, was due more or less to the particularly objectionable smells from this cause in the neighbourhood affected. At the time of writing this Report, a Conference of neighbouring Borough Councils, which has been convened by this Council, is about to meet to consider this question in all its bearings. Refuse Removal. New ash receptacles have been provided in 688 cases. The system of removal, as it is carried out in this Borough, still leaves much to be desired with reference to its frequency and regularity, particularly in the summer months, and in connection with the poorer class of property; in these latter cases a daily removal of house refuse should be aimed at, for the back yards and small open spaces where the ash receptacles are stored very readily become highly objectionable, and favourable breeding ground for disease-producing organisms, especially in the warmer weather. The method of disposal of this material still leaves much to be desired, and some form of refuse destructor would appear to be the solution for the difficulty, which will have to be faced at no distant date. During the year members of the Council were invited to see a combined crusher and pulveriser for the treatment of house and town refuse at work, and whilst the idea itself was undoubtedly very good, yet in the process of working it did not seem to be so satisfactory as to commend itself strongly to the members who examined the system. Removal of Offensive Trade Refuse. During the year material alterations and considerable improvements have been effected in the method adopted for the collection of this material. From time to time the question has been under the consideration of the Public Health Committee, and the suggestion has been 64 made and seriously considered as to whether or not this Council ought to undertake the collection of this material themselves in order to have it dealt with in as satisfactory a manner as possible. Up to the present the supporters of the view that the Municipality should not undertake this work, but should require the private firms to carry out this work more satisfactorily have, I am pleased to say, prevailed, and with the object of having more intimate control over the collection, but without entering upon the business themselves, a contract has been entered into by the Council with Messrs. Hempleman and Sons, of West Ham, for the collection and removal of this material-in a perfectly inoffensive and entirely satisfactory manner at a fixed charge, the payment being made by the offal producers themselves direct to Messrs. Hempleman. The method adopted is that one or more metal drums with lids are left at the premises of each person entering into the scheme, in which they are to place their offensive material; Messrs. Hempleman's van then calls at frequent, regular, and stated times for these drums, the lid is securely fastened down upon a rubber seating by means of a strong spring lever, the whole tin and its contents are lifted bodily into the van and conveyed away unopened; a clean drum is left at the premises in exchange for each one removed. Since the adoption of this scheme there have been no complaints whatever as to nuisance occasioned by the collection of this material, which complaints were of very frequent occurrence previously. Having placed this model method of collection at the disposal of all makers of offensive refuse in the Borough, the Council were then in a position to bring pressure to bear upon all other persons making, storing, or collecting and removing this material in an improper manner; this pressure has had the very satisfactory result of causing competing firms to 65 discard their old method, and adopt this newer and more satisfactory form. When the Committee were considering the advisability of the Council undertaking this work, they were met with the fact that there would be great difficulty in disposing of the material. This view of the matter has been considerably strengthened recently because one finds that whilst during the months of November, December, January and February, this material must not be removed within the boundaries of the County of London before 6 a.m., outside the boundaries of the County it must not be removed after 6 a.m., from which it will be seen that this anomalous state of the law causes great difficulty in the removal and disposal of the offal; which is frequently brought to the notice of the Contractors removing the material for the Council, in the way of prosecutions with their attendant penalties, for breaking the law in removing this material during prohibited hours. It will be seen that whilst it is possible to bring the material to one side of a street which is within the County boundary after 6 a.m. any day during the months quoted, yet it is never possible to get it to the other side of the same street and beyond, which is without the County boundary and within the area in which it has to be removed before 6 a.m. I certainly think that this anomalous condition of affairs should be brought to the notice of the Local Government Board and the Home Office with a view to the law being altered. Water Supply. The water supplied throughout the whole of the District by the Metropolitan Water Board still maintains its high standard of purity. During the latter part of October, however, it appears that samples of water collected in the area 66 supplied by the Plumstead Pumping Station gave unusual results, and this supply was discontinued for a time until the disturbing element had been removed. During the year 214 water supply certificates have been granted under section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; these certificates stating that the new houses to which they refer are supplied with a proper water supply in accordance with the Act. Defective water fittings have been renewed in 61 cases; 35 water supplies have been reinstated where the supply had been cut off; 159 water supplies have been altered so as to draw direct from the main; the cleansing, repairing, and covering of cisterns has been required in 187 cases. Public Sanitary Conveniences. During the year, a Local Government Board enquiry has been held with respect to a loan for the provision of an underground convenience at Creek Road, St. Nicholas; sanction has been given for the loan; plans and specifications for the work have been got out and tenders invited, so that, presumably, at no distant date, the lack of this class of convenience in this neighbourhood will be supplied. By-laws with respect to the decent conduct of persons using these Public Sanitary Conveniences have been approved by the Local Government Board, and Regulations respecting the duties of the attendants have been passed by this Council during the year. The various sanitary conveniences in connection with licensed premises which open on to the public footpath have all been inspected and reported upon during the year; various alterations and improvements have been required in connection with them, in order to abate any offence against public decency which might 67 have been occasioned by the situation or imperfect construction of these places. In three cases steps were taken under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, section 22, for the alteration of these urinals, but in consequence of the great difficulty which was encountered in making any satisfactoryalteration, in each case the urinal has been voluntarily closed. The list of Public Sanitary Conveniences, Urinals, Drinking Fountains, and Horse Troughs situated within the Borough is now as follows :— Public Sanitary Conveniences (with accommodation for both sexes)— At junction of South Street with Greenwich Road. At junction of Blackwall Lane with Woolwich Road. Urinals— "Ordnance Arms," Lewisham Road. Blackheath Hill. South Street. Straightsmouth. King William Street. Park Row. "King William the Fourth" P.H.

Blackwall Lane. 68 Horse Troughs— Blackheath Road. Church Street. Woolwich Road. Blackwall Lane. Charlton Village. Westcombe Hill. Smoke Nuisances. Four hundred and twenty-three observations have been taken for smoke nuisances during the year, but only on three occasions was it found necessary to issue Statutory Notices for the abatement of any nuisance which was found; no prosecution has been necessary during the year on this account. Several communications have been received from the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department of the London County Council with respect to alleged nuisances from black smoke within the Borough, but these allegations have been seldom substantiated by the inspections carried out by your Staff, and it leads one to think that there must be a diversity of opinion as to what constitutes a nuisance in this connection, the Act of Parliament specifying definitely that the smoke emitted and causing the nuisance, shall be "black smoke." Of course one is quite aware that frequently serious nuisance is occasioned by large volumes of smoke which, however, are outside the category of Public Health Act nuisances by reason of the smoke not being black in its character. I am inclined to think that the Officers of the Public Control Department in their zeal for suppressing nuisances are liable to include nuisances of the character described, especially when one considers that the onus of proving the case in the Police Court does not rest upon them but upon the Officers of this Department. 69 Food and Drugs Acts. Three hundred samples have been purchased under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which 285 were certified to be genuine and 15 adulterated, the adulterations thus being equivalent to 5 per cent. of the samples taken. A few other samples were purchased during the year, but were not submitted for analysis, in some cases because the vendor, before the completion of the purchase, made a sufficient declaration as to the character of the article being delivered which would have nullified any proceedings that might have had to be taken; in other cases because the samples were known to be genuine by reason of various circumstances attendant upon the purchase; and in other cases because the purchase of the sample was not accompanied by all the formalities set out under the Act, by reason of the purchase being made by an Agent employed to make these purchases at regular intervals in order to become as it were a regular customer at the premises suspected, it having been found that whilst regular customers were supplied with articles not always genuine, yet on the appearance of a stranger to make a purchase a genuine article was supplied, thus, although the agent employed to take the samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts always received genuine articles, the working people resident in the neighbourhood and dealing regularly at the premises were supplied with articles more or less adulterated. Of the total number of samples purchased, 109 were butter, of which 9 were adulterated; 109 were milk, of which 2 only were certified to be adulterated; the remaining adulterated samples were 2 of coffee, 1 of cream, the adulteration in this case being only a small amount of preservative, and no proceedings 70 were taken, and 1 sample of Demerara sugar. Proceedings were taken in two other cases on account of margarine, which was sold without proper labels and descriptions. Of the total number of samples, 6 were taken in course of, and at the place of, delivery, by an Officer of this Council direct, of which number 1 was certified to be adulterated; 10 were taken by an Officer of the Council direct, of which 2 were certified to be adulterated, and 1 of margarine was sold unlabelled; the remaining 284 samples were taken by agents employed by the Officers of this Council. Sixteen samples were taken on Sundays during the year, only 1 of which was certified to be adulterated. The practice of displaying notices in shops, or other similar premises, making a declaration in more or less ambiguous fashion to the effect that in order to comply with the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, "Notice is hereby given that no guarantee is made or implied as to the purity of any articles, but that all goods sold at this establishment are of the usual high quality," is becoming increasingly prevalent, and accordingly is very materially restricting the operations of the Food and Drugs Inspector; for whilst the general public read the notice and understand it to mean a testimonial in favour of the high quality of the goods supplied, yet on the other hand the Inspector knows that should goods be purchased at that establishment and be found to be adulterated, as would most likely be the case, any Police Court proceedings would be entirely nullified by the production of the above-mentioned notice. An illustration of the variable view taken by Magistrates of the seriousness of any case is shown by the amount of the fine 71 imposed in a case of marked adulteration during the year. A person carrying on a large business in a poor class neighbourhood, who is known to deal extensively in margarine and other adulterated goods, was proceeded against in the Police Court, and the case was proved to the satisfaction of the Magistrate; then came the question as to any previous convictions, and we were able to prove that in this same Police Court the same Defendant had been fined the following amounts for similar infractions of the law, in consecutive order during the last five years:—in 1901, £4; 1902, £1 in two cases; 1903, £10 and £3; and in 1904, £20; from a consideration of which amounts one naturally expected that the fine on this occasion would have been of a very substantial character indeed, as the previous warnings did not appear to have had much effect. The Defendant, however, was agreeably surprised to find that he was let off on this sixth occasion with a fine of £10. 72 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—Number and Description of Samples purchased for Analysis under the above Acts during the Year 1905.

Public Health and Housing Department, Royal Hill, Greenwich, S.E. The Inaugural Meeting of this Congress was held in His Majesty's Theatre, Haymarket, on Wednesday, July 19th, when there were present about 1,000 Fellows and Delegates from various Sanitary Authorities and other bodies. 80 The President of the Congress was the most Honourable the Marquis of Londonderry, K.G., who was supported on the platform by the Lord Stanley of Alderley, the Lord Bishop of Hereford, the Lord Bishop of Bristol, Sir James Crichton-Brown, M.D., Sir Charles Cameron, M.D., and others. The Lord Londonderry, in his Presidential Address, referred to the advance that had been made during the interval that had elapsed, viz., 14 years, since the last Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health had been held in London, indicating the work which had been done by the Institute to raise the standard of Public Health work generally throughout the Kingdom. He touched upon various points with reference to the question of Physical Deterioration which has been very much to the front lately. He seemed to think that in this matter the measures in force for dealing with underfed children are totally inadequate to cope with the evil. He also dealt with the question of the teaching of Hygiene in Schools, and stated that the Board of Education had given very great consideration to this difficulty, and would shortly issue suggestions as to the kind of teaching which was advisable. It was also thought that it was most desirable that women teachers should learn how a typical artizan household should be conducted in respect to food, clothing and cleanliness; it was also recognised that one important branch of education was the training of girls and young women for home duties. He also said that the Board had undertaken a survey of the kind of instruction now given with a view to improving it in any respects in which it was not suitable to the needs of the scholars. 81 After the usual votes of thanks, the opening proceedings terminated. The Congress was divided into various sections for the consideration and discussion of subjects bearing upon the various aspects of Public Health work. Sir James Crichton-Brown, who was President of the Preventive Medicine Section, gave a very stirring Address on the "Prevention of Senility." He stated that the most vigorous period of human life, in its entirety, was obviously between twentyfive and forty years, but to say that men above the latter age were comparatively useless was to fly in the face of the biographical dictionary. Much of the best work had been done by men over forty, and he was prepared to maintain that long after sixty, when, according to Dr. Osier, retirement and silence should be imposed upon all men, contributions of inestimable value had been made to our fund of knowledge. The best antiseptic against senile decay was an active interest in human affairs, and those kept young longest who loved most. It was a good working hypothesis that the natural life of man was 100 years, that so far as it fell short of that it was curtailed of fair proportion; he thought that every man was entitled to his century, and every woman to a century and a little more. Dr. T. Hyslop gave a very interesting discourse on "Brain Fag in Children," pointing out that any learning by rote was one of the most vicious causes of brain fag, and was largely due to competition as determined by our vain-glorious system of merely accumulating knowledge. 82 It was pointed out in the discussion that more sleep was necessary for growing and working young people than was at present allowed in many of the public schools. The subject of Milk Supply, with special reference to the Feeding of Infants, was once more very much in evidence, and several very interesting papers and discussions had relation to this problem. Abundant reasons were adduced for the establishment of Municipal Milk Depots, and it was declared that children were dying by thousands every year for the lack of such provision. The Liverpool Municipal Milk Depots were again described in detail, and the large amount of encouraging work carried out in that city at an annual cost of £1,200. Councillor A. W. Short, of Bootle, advocated the Municipalisation of the milk supply in its entirety. Another view of the question was given in the advocating of a reform coming from America, in which the production of Medically certified milk was described as carried out at one of the Farms under the New York Medical Committee. By this system practically everything except the milk itself is sterilised, and the natural product, thus assured a high pitch of cleanliness, sells at a shilling a quart to the well-to-do New Yorker. One passage from this paper may be worth quoting:— "The day's work commenced at 4.30 a.m. every morning by each cow being led singly, and in turn, from their living stable into the washing and cleaning shed. Here they are washed with sponges and brushes in antiseptic water, and dried with sterilised towels. As each cow is finished off, a lad leads it by the halter to the milking shed, where 83 it is fastened to a snap along the wall. Here the milkers take each cow in hand as it arrives from the cleaning shed. These milkers are required to wash themselves thoroughly in a bathroom provided adjacent to the milking shed, and to wear clean linen clothes that are frequently washed and sterilised twice daily." The result of all this elaborate care was that, according to Mr. Rhodes, while ordinary milk supplied to New York was found to contain 5,000,000 bacteria to the cubic centimetre, an analysis of certified milk showed an average of only from 1,500 to 1,600 bacteria in the same bulk. It will be seen from the price paid for this milk, that however admirable the system may be, it is only applicable in the case of very wealthy families, and would not at all meet the requirements of the poorest of the poor, in whom we chiefly are concerned. The experiment which is now being carried out at Huddersfield was also discoursed upon, and the Mayor of Huddersfield detailed his personal experiences gained in the supervision of seventy-four babies who are participating in his private scheme. He stated that in the small district concerned it was regarded as a disgrace for a woman to lose a child, and therein lay a moral for other districts. He also pointed out that he had found that mothers were remarkably teachable, and it seems to us that herein lies the line upon which Sanitary Authorities will have to work to combat this great evil. Dr. Hewitt, Cheshire, said that the high rate of mortality was due to bad sanitary surroundings, and to the carelessness and ignorance of mothers. 84 The chief points left in our minds, as the result of hearing these very able papers and discussions are:— That we must aim at a better education of the mothers and prospective mothers in reference to the better carrying on of home and maternal duties, which may be accomplished by courses of instruction to the elder girls in schools, and by the provision of Women Health Visitors for those who are not now attending schools; and on the other hand, that all possible steps must be taken to provide proper nourishment for young children, and this again can be promoted by educating the parents and by the provision of suitable supplies of nourishment for those who are unable to give the natural product. This section also dealt with the question of providing Sanatoria for Consumptives, which also is a matter of great importance. It was shown that at the present time 60,000 people die from this disease in England and Wales every year, and it is estimated that there are in London alone 40,000 persons affected with Consumption, and as many more by other forms of Tuberculosis, the majority of these cases coming from the Industrial classes, and a third of the deaths from these diseases occurring in Poor Law Institutions. It was shown that philanthropic effort was inadequate to cope with the situation, and it was suggested that what is wanted is a directing and controlling body which could deal with the cases throughout the country, thus placing the matter on a national basis. For this purpose it was thought that the time is ripe for a Government enquiry into the whole subject, a Resolution on these lines being adopted. 85 The Educational Section was presided over by Mr. J. H. Yoxall, M.P., and in this section many able papers were given, producing discussions bearing upon the Education question as it affects the health of the children, the question of the presence in schools of underfed children being particularly brought to the front. Papers were also read bearing upon the planning and sanitary construction of schools. Other Sections of the Congress were: One dealing with Child Life and School Hygiene; One dealing with Bacteriological Work; in which able papers were given on the question of the bacteriological purity of water, milk, and other articles. One paper dealt particularly upon the great risk there is of picking up disease germs in public conveyances, and especially in railway carriages, a Resolution being passed upon this subject with which, we also, from our local experiences, shall be heartily in sympathy. In the Section dealing with Engineering and Building, papers were read on the Ventilation and Heating of Large Buildings, and also very able papers and discussions bearing upon the Smoke and Fog question. The Hon. Rollo Russell in his paper on the Prevention of Smoky Fogs, pointed out, very ably, the physical reasons producing, and conducing to, the fogs which we have in London. He showed that the character and persistence of London fogs was not due to an excess of particles only, but to an excess of particles of a certain kind; that for the production of fog, the radiative and tarry particles from bituminous coal, which is the kind of coal generally used in domestic fireplaces in London, were by far the most effective, and that in New York, where the use of 86 bituminous coal was prohibited, they had a clear air and no persistent or yellow fogs. He did not doubt that if London burned wood, or anthracite, or gas, it would have an atmosphere as transparent in clear weather as that of Paris or Rome. Dark fogs artificially prolonged, were due to the uneconomic burning of bituminous coal, and kitchen or ordinary fires were more responsible for them than factories. Professor Henry Adams in his paper on Smoke Abatement, reminded us that smoke was only unconsumed fuel, so that its appearance was direct evidence of wasteful extravagance. The Treasurer of the Coal Smoke Abatement Society, in his paper, pointed out that if the improvement was to be effected it must be by the lessening of smoke, particularly the early morning smoke. He stated that a large number of owners of factories had communicated with his Society, stating that the absence of smoke from their chimneys was due to careful stoking and good coal, and not to mechanical contrivances. The absence of smoke had led to increased efficiency and economy in working. A Resolution on this matter was also unanimously agreed upon. There were many other instructive papers, but the above appear to us to be those dealing with points which we have particularly before us at the present time. The final combined meeting of the various Sections of the Congress was held on July 25th, when the various Resolutions passed by the Sections were brought forward and adopted by the whole Congress; these Resolutions being as follows:— 87 Section A. — Preventive Medicine. 1.—That the present hours of sleep allowed to boys under sixteen years of age in some of the public schools are too short for enabling them to attain their highest physical and mental development, and that a copy of this Resolution be sent to the headmasters of all public schools. 2. That a representation be made to the Home Office, respectfully suggesting the total abolition of "half-time" in factories and workshops. 3.—That, in view of the importance of the subject, the Government be respectfully urged to appoint a Royal Commission to fully consider the question of the advisability of the adoption of the Sanatorium treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis for the poor. 4.—That this Section is of opinion that there is urgent need for the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry into the prevalence and effects of Syphilis, and the means of its prevention, and into the adequacy of hospital accommodation for its treatment, and that the Government be so informed. 5.—That security of tenure is most desirable for Medical Officers of Health and Inspectors of Nuisances (Sanitary Inspectors), so as to enable them to carry out their official duties without fear or favour. 6.—That in the opinion of this Section, it is most important and desirable that provision for the medical inspection of all school children in this country should be made, and that the Education Department should have at its disposal the services of a Medical Officer. 88 Section B.—Municipal Administration of the Education Acts. 1.—That in the interest of educational efficiency, adequate steps should he taken to ensure that all children should be properly fed. 2.—That this section deprecates the granting of Scholarships to which are attached conditions of future service. Section D.—Building Construction and Engineering. 1.—That this Congress, being impressed with the importance of clearing the atmosphere of towns from smoke, urges on His Majesty's Government and Local Authorities the advisability of further efforts being made to attain this object. Section E.—Bacteriology and Chemistry. 1.—That, in the opinion of this Congress, the sale of disinfectants other than solutions of definite chemical composition, or substances intended for the preparation of such solutions, should be accompanied by a definite statement of their bactericidal efficiency as compared with a standard disinfectant of definite chemical composition. 2.—That, in the interests of the public health and the control of infectious disease, the regular and efficient disinfectant cleansing of all public conveyances should be undertaken by the owners. Section F.—Veterinary Hygiene. That, in the interests of the public health, it is desirable that there should be compulsory notification of the slaughter of 89 animals intended for human food at other than licensed slaughterhouses, and that all parts of the carcass, including the internal organs, should be retained for inspection, after such notification. Section G.—Tropical Hygiene. That the Council of the Royal Institute of Public Health be requested to represent to the proper authorities the necessity for teaching elementary hygiene in the vernacular in schools in India. After the passing of various votes of thanks, the Fourteenth Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health then terminated. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF GREENWICH.
