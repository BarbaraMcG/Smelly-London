The Board during the year ended 25th March, 1881, obtained the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works to the following Loans:— £2100 advanced by the Metropolitan Board for Sewer Works in Crown Road, Fulham. £6800 advanced by the Metropolitan Board for Sewer Works in Scrub Lane, the actual cost of the works amounting to £6895 17s. 10d. £1700 This Loan is for part of the amount expended in excess of the sum borrowed for the New Board Room and Alterations to Offices at Broadway House. The Loan has not yet been taken up. £2400 This Loan is for the amount expended in excess of the sum borrowed for the Erection of Stables and Workshops at the rear of the Broadway; and for the Erection of additional Stables at Trafalgar House, Walham Green. The Loan has not yet been taken up. Chalets. An application having been made by the Chalet Company for permission to erect Chalets de Toilette under certain rules and conditions in parts of the District, application was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for sanction to have one erected on Shepherd's Bush Common ; this was however refused, and this Board has granted permission for one to be erected at the bifurcation of the road, at the Eastern end of the Common, an agreement has been entered into with the company, and the chalet will shortly be erected. It is hoped that it will prove a boon to the public in general. The structure will be of iron, wood and brick, the dimensions being, length 20 feet, breadth 12 feet, and elevation 10 feet; but these are subject to modification. The lower portion is a frame- work of wood, panelled to an elevation of 6 feet, above which, encircling the entire structure, are arranged glass panels of varied colours, which, utilised for carefully selected advertisements, are lighted up at night by gas. The interior will be divided into two distinct compartments, one for ladies and theother for gentlemen, the entrance being at either end of the chalet; that to the ladies' compartment being entered through a vestibule, fitted up as a cloak room, where parcels may be left at a small charge. 20 The lavatory and retiring rooms will open out from the cloak room, the whole being under the charge of an experienced female attendant. The arrangements on the men's side are similar, increased lavatory and closet accommodation being afforded in place of the cloak room. The charges are to be one penny for booking parcels, one penny for use of retiring room, and the same for lavatory. A shoeblack in the service of the company will be stationed at each chalet. Street Nomenclature. By section 87 of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, it becomes the duty of Vestries and District Boards to carry out the orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works for renaming streets, abolishing subsidiary names, and renumbering the houses, and in pursuance thereof the Board has carried out the orders of the Metropolitan Board For renumbering the houses in Rockley Road and abolishing the names of Penistone Street and Penistone Gardens. For renumbering the houses in Richford Street and abolishing the subsidiary names of Hainsvale Terrace and Searle's Terrace. For continuing the existing numbers in a portion of Estcourt Road, Fulham. For renumbering the houses in Godolphin Road, Shepherd's Bush, and abolishing the subsidiary names. The road running from the Broadway to Glenthorne Road has been named "Beadon Road." Pillar Letter Boxes. At the request of the Post Office authorities the Board has, during the year, granted permission for the erection of a pillar box in the Harrow Road, near the College Park Estate, and for the removal of pillar box from the east end of Hammersmith Terrace to the west end of same. Theresa Terrace. In consequence of the bad condition of the path at the west end of King Street by Theresa Terrace, the Board has carried out certain paving works (7 feet wide) to the path opposite this Terrace, defined the kerb line, and planted a row of trees, thus considerably improving the public highway at this point. Fulham Dock. A new road having been made by the District Railway Company leading from High Street to their Putney Bridge Station, it was thought advisable to make certain alterations to the 21 entrance to the Fulham Draw Dock, and the Board has agreed to pull down a portion of the boundary walls of the dock and build a new wall so as to widen High Street at that point, the company agreeing to alter and improve the line of their approach road. Loans.—Charge upon the District. The question of making all loans a charge upon the whole district instead of charging each parish with the amount of loan incurred for work done in such parish, having been carefully considered, together with report and returns prepared by the accountant shewing that under the former system the total annual charges (other than district loan charges) for 1880-81 for General and Sewers Rate together is payable thus:— FULHAM HAMMERSMITH TOTAL £4015 14 9 £7270 10 5 £11286 5 2, but if made payable as district charges, each parish paying according to its rateable value, the payment would be FULHAM HAMMERSMITH TOTAL £3762 1 8 £7524 3 6 £11286 5 2 shewing that Fulham would pay the sum of £253 13 1 less, and Hammersmith that sum more. In the year 1883-84 (excluding future loans) Fulham will pay on this principle the sum of £467 12 2 less, and in 1887-88 £543 4 8 less, and Hammersmith these sums more, in that year about reaching its maximum; but in 15 years times, say 1896—97, when the heavy charge of Fulham Sewer Loans has expired, the additional cost to Hammersmith will have run down to £233 10 0, and will rapidly decrease thereafter. Taking these figures into consideration, and being of opinion that it was the intention of the Legislature that these charges should be borne by the larger area (except under special circumstances), the Board has ordered that from and after the 25th March all loans shall be charged as district expenses, to be apportioned both as to expenditure and repayment upon each parish according to its rateable value and assessment. Freeing the Bridges. On the 26th of June, 1880, their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales declared Wandsworth Bridge, Fulham Bridge and Hammersmith Bridge to be open for ever free of toll under the provisions of the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act, 1877. These three bridges formed the third and last division to be dealt with under the Act, and thus completed the work ordered by that measure. There now exists no toll bridge over the Thames within the Metropolitan area. 22 For Wandsworth Bridge the amount claimed was £150,000, and the amount paid £52,761, with £550 for additional land; for Fulham Bridge there was claimed £100,000, and £58,000 awarded, and for Hammersmith Bridge £201,000 was claimed, and £112,500 awarded. As the inhabitants are aware, steps were taken to mark in a proper manner so important an event in our Local History, and a right royal welcome was given to their Royal Highnesses on the occasion. New Bridge at Fulham. In November the necessary Parliamentary notices were given and plans deposited for a New Bridge over the Thames between Fulham and Putney. It is in contemplation to erect the New Bridge at a point a little above the present old bridge, and to form a new approach road on the Fulham side from the corner of Church Row through the Vicarage Gardens. Negociations are also in progress between the Metropolitan Board and the Chelsea Water Works Company with a view to provision being made in the construction of the New Bridge for carrying the aqueduct of the company thereon, so that the present unsightly erection may be removed. Hammersmith Bridge. The Metropolitan Board of Works are having prepared, plans and specifications for the thorough repair and permanent strengthening of this bridge, but the precise nature of the alterations to be made have not yet been determined. Wandsworth Bridge. The Metropolitan Board of Works have been engaged in repairing this bridge and are now carrying out some works with a view of securing better foundations for the piers. Wood Paving—King Street West. The experiment in King Street East having proved satisfactory, the Board has carried out certain wood paving works in King Street West from the Broadway to Shaftesbury Road at a cost of £5,788 8 10. Improvement—King Street West, near Clifton Road. An opportunity having presented itself of improving this street by widening the path between the "Salutation Inn" and Clifton Road, proceedings were taken under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, and negotiations were entered into which resulted 23 in the Hoard acquiring the land in front of premises occupied by Mr. Vine, and the path has been widened at that spot. Negotiations are still pending for the improvement to be carried out up to the corner of Clifton Road. Erecting Hoardings without Licence. It having been reported that a builder had erected a hoarding in front of some shops in High Street, Fulham, without having previously taken out a licence, in order to secure obedience to the law and for the protection of the public, proceedings were taken under section 122 of the 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, and the builder was fined 40s. and 2s. costs. The licence was subsequently taken out. Holland Road A small portion only of the road being within the parish of Hammersmith, it was thought desirable that the Metropolitan Board should be applied to to make an order for placing that portion of the road under the jurisdiction of the Kensington Vestry for the future. The order has been made and the Board now pay to the Kensington Vestry the sum of £35 per annum for the maintenance of that portion of the road. Section 86, 25 & 26 Vic., cap. 102. Embankment. The Board has again memorialised the Metropolitan Board as to the construction of an embankment from Hammersmith Bridge to Chiswick, but without any satisfactory result. That Board stating that after giving careful consideration to the request of the Board it has arrived at the conclusion that it is not expedient to apply to Parliament for power to undertake the work suggested in the memorial. The Board has not, therefore, proceeded any further in the matter at present. Cartage, &c. Scheme. The stabling, workshops, etc. at the rear of the Broadway, Hammersmith, were completed by the end of May. The Cartage Committee, as a commencement of the scheme, purchased 7 horses, and they have purchased at different times since sufficient to complete the number for which stabling has been provided, viz.: 41; this number, with the 6 horses in possession at the end of the last financial year, makes a total of 47—4 of which stand at Broadway House stables and 2 at Fulham. The work of slopping and watering the roads, general cartage, 24 &c. has been partly, and as far as possible, done by the Board's horses and staff since the first purchase. Under the direction and supervision of the Cartage Committee, the work of removal of ashes and house refuse has been carried out by the Board's staff since the 25th August, 1880, with satisfactory results, complaints as to non-removal now being comparatively rare, and applications for removal are not so frequent as they were when the work was done by contract. Fodder.—The fodder is supplied by contract, tenders being received each Quarter. The supply has been constantly under the inspection of the Cartage Committee. The actual consumption from the commencement has been— Oats 677 quarters Beans 351/8 „ Bran 294¼ cwt. Clover 64 5/36 loads Hay 248/9 „ Straw 951/9 „ Mixture 12 „ Linseed 2¼ bushels Oatmeal 14 lbs Carrots 9 bags the total value being £1622 7 5 less the amount realised by the sale of stable refuse 19 19 2 £1602 8 3 The average cost per horse per week is 18s. 2d. The chaff, mixture, &c. has been cut by the machine worked by the gas engine at a cost for labour and gas of 3s. per load. The Superintendent of the stables states that the number of loads of dust removed during the year from— FULHAM HAMMERSMITH 8344. 11084. Horses.—Since the purchase of the first batch of horses, 25th May, 1880, the average number under treatment for sickness or injury has been 3221/311 per diem. This has been mainly due to the horses being mostly young ones fresh from the country, and taking into consideration this fact, the number is thought to be not large. The number of deaths has been 3, from the following causes:—One apoplexy of the lungs, 1 destroyed with lock-jaw, and 1 with dropsy on the chest. The average cost per horse of the 41 horses is £66 15 3. The estimate being £80. 25 Value of Live Stock, Machinery, &c. on Stock. £ s. d. £ s. d. I.

The Board, on the 14th July, 1880, re-appointed Mr. Davies for 12 months from that date, and a statement of the various articles analysed, with result in each case, will be found (see Appendix No. 5). Officers' Duties, Salaries, &c. A special committee of the whole Board was appointed on the 28th July, 1880, for the purpose of considering and reporting upon the duties and salaries of the whole of the officers of the Board. A sub-committee was appointed, which instituted enquiries and obtained reports upon the subject, arid on the 12th January the special committee presented their report, which was adopted by the Board, and such alterations were made in the 28 staff as were deemed to be necessary to meet the rapidly increasing work of this important district. Open Spaces.—Eelbrook Common, Brook Green & Parson's Green. The necessary legal formalities for transferring these commons to the Metropolitan Board has not been completed, but it is expected that a short time only will elapse ere the matter is finally settled, and the commons improved. Four Mile Radius. The Home Secretary having ordered a new measurement of the "Four Mile Radius" from the statue at Charing Cross, lampposts have been put up at certain spots, to which plates have been fixed, indicating the measurement. The lamp-posts are painted a similar colour to the pillar letter boxes. Piggeries.—Latymer Road. The Board has endeavoured to obtain the removal of the piggeries in Latymer road, but the attempt failed. The Board proceeded against the pigkeepers by summons; the cases came on before Mr. Paget at the Hammersmith Police Court, when the witnesses called to support the Board's case failed to give such evidence as would satisfy the magistrate that they were suffering from the nuisances caused by the pigs ; not in any case did the witnesses bear out the statements previously made, and ultimately the summonses were withdrawn. Notwithstanding this the Board hope, at no distant time, to succeed in clearing the district of piggeries and such-like trades and occupations, which seriously depreciate the surrounding property. Improvement— Great Church Lane. A plan has been prepared by the Surveyor, shewing an improvement by widening Great Church Lane, East and West of the Railway Bridge. The Trustees of the Latymer Charity have been applied to to assist in the improvements by giving up the piece of land required; the Board undertaking to set back the fence and do all the necessary works. The negotiations are progressing slowly, but the Board hopes that they will be brought to an issue shortly. Margravine Lane.— Widening. A suggestion having been made to the Board for the purchase of a certain piece of waste land at the back of the Union 29 grounds, which land had been improperly enclosed by some person, application was made to the Copyhold Court and the Lords of the Manor, and the Board agreed to pay to the Lords the nominal sum of 20s. for the land, and to pay the cost of admission on acquiring the land; the Board removed the fence, set back the line of path, and widened the carriageway at that spot. The road has also been widened and improved by the entrance gates to the Hammersmith Cemetery. Hammersmith Police Court—(Sanitary Condition of). A letter from Dr. Hardwicke, the Coroner for Central Middlesex, addressed to the Hammersmith Vestry, was forwarded to the Board, stating that at an inquest held at Her Majesty's Prison, Clerkenwell, on the body of Matilda Marchant, the Jury appended a rider to their verdict, that they were of opinion that the Medical Officer of the District should be requested to inspect and report upon the condition of the police cells at the Hammersmith Police Court, alleged to be in a defective state. The letter was referred to the Medical Officer of Health, with a direction to inspect and report. An inspection was made, and the Medical Officer of Health presented a special report to the Board, a copy of which was forwarded to the Home Secretary, and certain alterations and improvements have been effected, and the cells and court are in a more satisfactory condition. Crown Road Improvement. The negotiations have been brought to a successful issue, and steps are now being taken for the stopping up of the old footway and roadway, and constructing the new road, in accordance with the provisions of the Highway Act. Parliamentary Plans. In accordance with the standing orders of Parliament, plans, sections, books of reference and copy of Gazette notice were deposited at the office of the Board on the 30th day of November last, as follows:— 1.—Sea Water Supply to London. This Bill is for the construction and laying conduits and pipes under certain public roads, for the purpose of bringing sea water from Lancing in Sussex to London, and as it proposed to interfere with some of the roads in the district, the Board resolved to petition against the Bill. The promoters having inserted in the Bill certain clauses prepared by the Law and 30 mentary Committee, the petition has, by order, been withdrawn. 2.—Guildford, Kingston and London Railway. This Bill is for the construction of a railway from the present terminus of the District Railway at Fulham Bridge, across the Thames, on to Kingston and Guildford; it not proposing to interfere with any public roads in the district, the Board presented no petition against the Bill. 3.—Metropolitan District Railway Bill. This Bill is for the construction of a short line of railway to connect the District Railway at Hammersmith with the Hammersmith and City line, and other purposes. The Board resolved to petition against the Bill. The Bill, so far as the Hammersmith Junction was concerned, was subsequently withdrawn. 4.—Great Western Railway Bill. This Bill proposed to give power to the Great Western Railway Company to purchase the triangular piece of land next the Sussex Arms. It not proposing to interfere with any public roads or places, no action was taken by the Board. 5.—Metropolitan Railway Bill. This Bill proposed to give power to the Metropolitan Railway Company to purchase the same piece of land. No action therein was taken by the Board. 6.—Metropolitan Bridges and Ferry Roads. This Bill is for the purpose of empowering the Metropolitan Board of Works to construct a new bridge across the Thames at Fulham, and the Board resolved to support the Bill. (See report under the head of New Bridge at Fulham). 7.—Fulham District Railway. This Bill is for the construction of a short line of railway to connect the present line running under Great Church Lane with the line at Parson's Green. The Board petitioned against the Bill, which was ultimately abandoned. 8.—Shepherd's Bush, Gunnersbury, and Kew Tramway. This was a notice of intention to apply to the Board of Trade for a provisional order for the construction of a tramway from the Uxbridge Road Station to Young's Corner, thence to Gunnersbury and Kew Bridge, and asking the Board to consent to the construction of the said tramway. The Board gave its consent thereto, subject to the alteration of certain clauses and the insertion of certain new clauses in the said orders providing for the proper protection of the public roads. 31 Uncertified Deaths. The attention of the Board having been drawn to the number of burials that take place in the Metropolis without a proper certificate of the cause of death having been given, a letter was addressed to the Home Secretary, and a copy forwarded to the Borough and County Members, calling attention to the matter. Convent Lane Widening. Negotiations are in progress for widening this lane from Rowan Road to Elm Grove. The Board hope that it will soon be in a position to report that arrangements have been made for carrying out this much needed improvement. Lighting Willesden Road. Part of this road being in Acton Parish, the Board has made arrangements with the local authorities for lighting the portion of road in this district. London and Suburban Market Company. A Bill having been deposited proposing to create a market on some land just outside the boundary of the district, on the North side of Goldhawk road, near Young's Corner, the Board petitioned against the measure, and the Bill was ultimately thrown out, the promoters not having fully complied with standing orders. New Streets. Under the provisions of the 18th & 19 Vic., cap. 120, 25 & 26 Vic., cap. 102, the Board has, during the year, taken to the following new streets:— Hammersmith Fulham Blomfield Road. Barr's Alley. Cross Road, Blomfield Road. Seagrave Road. Union Court. Ancill Street. Banim Street St. Oswald's Road. Frithville Gardens. Merrington Road. Hopgood Street. Chelmsford Street.

To the Fulham District Board of Works. Gentlemen,— I beg to present to you my Annual Report on the public health of this district during the year 1880. A census of the population has just been taken, from which it will be seen that in a period of ten years the number of inhabitants is almost double what it was at the end of the last decade. There are few districts in London that have in the same period so greatly increased in population. It is more than likely that in the course of another 10 years a still greater increase will take place. We may reasonably expect that at no very distant period the Fulham district will have one of the largest populations in the metropolis. Last year was very healthy, the mortality rate being the lowest but one registered during the past decade. The warm winter and the cold summer had much to do with this low mortality rate. The deaths from lung affections were particularly few, while those from febrile diseases were below the average. This district comprises an area of 4209 acres and an estimated population on the 31st of last December of 113,000 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three sub-districts, namely—Fulham, which is the parish of Fulham, and St. Peter's and St. Paul's, which together make the parish of Hammersmith. For the sake of brevity these subdistricts are hereafter called Fulham, St. Peter's and St. Paul's. 61 Fulham comprises an area of 1761 statute acres, St. Paul's 2102, and St. Peter's 185. On the 3rd of last April, when the census was taken, the population of Fulham was found to be 42,895, that of St. Peter's and St. Paul's together (i.e., Hammersmith parish) 71,916. On the 31st of last December there were about 16,548 inhabited houses in the district against 16,063 in the previous year. On the estimated population there was, at the end of last year, an average of 6 8 persons to each house. Of the 16,548 inhabited houses in the district last year, there were 11,000 in the parish of Hammersmith and 5548 in the parish of Fulham, against 10,910 in the parish of Hammersmith and 5153 in the parish of Fulham at the end of the previous year. There was therefore an increase last year of 485 inhabited houses in the whole district. There was an increase of 395 in the parish of Fulham ; 90 in the parish of Hammersmith. On the estimated population of this district there was an average of 26 8 persons to an acre at the end of last year, while there was an average of 48.6 persons per acre in the whole of London. Extensive building operations are now being carried on in many portions of the district. According to the census return just issued there were 1061 houses in process of construction on the 3rd of last April. The number of deaths registered in this district last year was 2217, males 1086, females 1131, being one death to every 50.9 of the population, against 2259 in the previous year, which equalled one death to 47.8. The average number of deaths registered during the last five years was 2117. Making due allowance for the increase of population, the deaths last year were 157 below the corrected decennial average. This mortality includes all the deaths registered in the distrtct. If, however, we deduct the 39 deaths of non-parishioners that took place at the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham, (allowing the deaths of non-parishioners in the West London Hospital and other public institutions to go as compensative allowance for the unknown deaths of parishioners which may have taken place in general hospitals and other public institutions outside the district,) the corrected mortality for last year was 2178. The gross annual death rate, therefore, taking the deaths as registered (2217) was 19.5 per thousand persons living, being 27 less than the death rate of all London, which was 22.2. The corrected mortality rate for the district was 19.3, being 2.9 less than that of all London. Of the deaths registered in this district last year, 120 took place in St. Peter's, 1158 in St. Paul's, and 939 in Fulham, against 125 in St. Peter's, 1076 in St. Paul's, and 1058 in Fulham the previous year. The average 62 number of deaths registered in the three sub-districts during the last five years was St. Peter's 126, St. Paul's 1049, and Fulham 936. There was therefore, last year, as compared with the average mortality during the last five years, a decrease of 6 deaths in St. Peter's, an increase of 109 deaths in St. Paul's, and an increase of 3 deaths in Fulham. When we take into consideration the great increase of population that has taken place in the whole district during the last five years, it can not but be expected that the actual number of deaths registered last year should be above the average number. It should be observed that although the actual number of deaths was greater last year than the average number in the last five years, nevertheless the mortality rate was the lowest but one registered during the last 11 years. It is satisfactory to notice that the mortality rate decreased last year, notwithstanding an increase in the number of the inhabitants and the greater density of the population. The numerous sanitary improvements that your Board have carried out and the increased vigilance that has been exercised, must undoubtedly have tended to counteract the evil effects that we might naturally expect to follow on an increase in the density of the population. TABLE I. The following table shows the deaths registered in the three sub-districts in the year 1879-1880, also the average number during the last five years:— Year. Sub-district of Fulham. Sub-district of St. Paul's. Sub-district of St. Peter's. 1879 1058 1076 125 1880 939 1158 120 Average of last five years. 936 1049 126 The number of deaths of infants at one year of age and under was 652, against 602 in the previous year. There were 26 in St. Peter's, 331 in St. Paul's, and 295 in Fulham, against 30 in St. Peter's, 284 in St. Paul's and 288 in Fulham during the previous year. The deaths were equal to 29.4. per cent. of the total deaths registered, and 15.5 per cent. of the total registered births. The per centage of these deaths in the whole of London was 25.8 to the total deaths registered, and 15.8 to the total registered births. In the three sub-districts the per centage of deaths at one year of age and under, to the total deaths and total births 63 respectively, was for St. Peter's 21.7 and 10.9, St. Paul's 28.6 and 14.9, Fulham 31.4. and 16.9. In St. Peter's, therefore, the per centage of these deaths to the total deaths and births was less than that of all London. In St. Paul's the per centage was greater as compated with the total deaths, but less as compared with the total births, while in Fulham both the per centages were greater than those of London. The very large poor population in many parts of Fulham is sufficient to account for the larger mortality among infants in that portion of the district. We may judge what a great improvement in the public health of London has taken place since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act in 1855, by the fact that the infantile mortality in that year was at the rate of 42.1 per cent. to the total deaths registered, and 30.3 per cent. to the total registered births. Those persons who complain of the evils of local self - government in the present day should compare the condition of public health now, to what it was before the time of the appointment of your Board. For a period of 25 years your Board has been constituted, and as a matter of fact the fruits of your labours have been that the condition of the public health of your district has continued to improve more and more during every year that you, as a public body, have been in existence. It is generally admitted as a fact in sanitary science that the infantile mortality is one of the best indications of the condition of public health. It is most interesting and satisfactory therefore to compare its present condition with what it was 25 vears ago. The following table shows the infantile mortality rate in London registered in the years 1855 and 1880:— 1855 1880 Per centage of deaths of infants under five years of age as compared with the total deaths registered 42.1 30.1 Per centage of deaths of infants under five years of age as compared with the total births registered 25.8 15.8 The number of deaths at 60 years of age and upwards was 432, of which there were 24 in St. Peter's, 227 in St. Paul's and 181 in Fulham, against 35 in St. Peter's, 257 in St. Paul's, and 172 in Fulham registered the previous year. The deaths were equal to 19.5 per cent. of the total deaths registered, while the per centage of the same in all London was 20.9. The rapid development of this district that is now taking place is the cause of this per centage being lower in the district than in London. In a new neighbourhood there is always a 64 very large proportion of young persons, and consequently the proportion of deaths of elderly persons is diminished. The following table shows the births, deaths, &c. registered in the Fulham District, also the mean temperature of each of the 11 years 1870-1880:— Year. Mean Temperature Fahrnt. Number of births. Number of deaths. Number of persons to each acre. Population estimated. * Census taken. Proportion of births to every 1000 persons living.

The facts look well in a public health point of view, and more particularly so when we consider the fact that during the last decade the density of the population has increased from 16 persons per acre to 26.9. The following table shows the quarterly number of deaths registered in the Fulham District during the year 1880:— Sub-district of Fulham. Sub-district of St. Paul's. Sub-district of St. Peter's. Grand Total. Qtr. Mean Temprature. Males. Females. Total. Males. Females. Total. Males. Females. Total. :Deg.

It may be observed also, as is usually the case, that the nearer the mean temperature approaches to 50 deg. Fahr. the lower is the mortality rate. As the temperature goes down from that standard the mortality from bronchial affections is increased; on the other hand, as the mean temperature rises above 50 degs. Fahr. the mortality rate is increased from enteric diseases, such as diarrhoea, &c. It should be noticed that this rule applies, to some extent, to the annual mean temperature. By reference to table II it will be seen that with a mean temperature of 46.2 in 1879 there were 2295 deaths, while last year, with a mean temperature of 49.1 deg., and an increase in the population to the extent of 6000 inhabitants, there were only 2217 deaths. The deaths of females exceeded those of males by 45. When, however, we take into consideration the fact, that according to the census return just issued, there was an excess of 8505 females over males, it will be seen that the relative mortality of males was greater than that of females The greater number of females living is to be accounted for by the fact of the greater mortality of males, and not that there are more females born. The number of births registered in this district last year was the greatest on record, being 4195 (males 2131, females 2064). The number of births of males, therefore, exceeded that of the females by 67. Of the 4195 births registered last year, there were 238 in St. Peter's (117 males and 121 females), 2212 in St. Paul's (1109 males and 1105 females), 1745 in Fulham (907 males and 838 females). The birth rate in the whole district was at the rate of 37.1 per annum per 1000 persons living, being one birth to 26.9 persons. The birth rate in the whole of London was equal to 36.2 per annum per 1000 persons living. The births exceeded the deaths in this district last year by 1978, and exceeded the number of births the previous year by 238. Estimating that the population has increased 6000 in the year, 1978 of this number was due to excess of births over deaths and 4022 to immigration. The following table shows the quarterly number of births of each sex registered in the Fulham district in the three subdistricts during the year 1880:— 66 Qrtr. Sub-district of Fulham.

The corrected number, therefore, of deaths from this class of diseases was 405, as compared with 374, the corrected number of deaths registered from the same class of diseases during the previous year. The corrected deaths from zymotic disease registered last year were equal to i8'2 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 36 per annum per thousand persons living. The deaths from zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 16.8 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 37 per annum per 1000 persons living. Thus we see that there was an increase of 31 deaths from zymotic diseases last year as compared with the previous year. The increase in the population of the district by immigration would represent about 23 deaths. The higher temperature of last summer as compared with the previous summer was the cause of the greater number of deaths from diarrhoea. On the whole, the deaths from zymotic diseases last year compare very favourably with those of the year previous. In this district last year there was a greater per centage of deaths from zymotic diseases than in all London as compared with the total number of deaths registered, but a smaller per centage as compared with the population. The higher per centage as compared with the total deaths, is attributable to the very large number of poor inhabitants in many portions of the district. It is always among the poor inhabitants that the general fatality from zymotic diseases is greatest. Of the 405 deaths from zymotic diseases, there were 13 in St. Peter's against 20 the previous year, 228 in St. Paul's against 146 the previous year, and 164 in Fulham against 208 the previous year. Thus we see that there was a decrease of 7 of these deaths in St Peter's, an increase of 82 in St. Paul's, and a decrease of 44 in Fulham. The following table shows the deaths from zymotic diseases (exclusive of those of non-parishioners that took place at the 67 Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham) registered in the district of Fulham in the years 1879-1880:— Disease. Year 1879. Year 1880. Sub-dist. Fulham. Sub-dist. St Paul's Sub-dist. St Peter's Total. Sub-dist. Fulham. Sub-dist. St Paul's Sub-dist. St Peter's Total.

It also shows that the three diseases, measles, whooping cough and diarrhoea, over which we have least direct control, were the three diseases through which the chief increase took place. On the other hand, those diseases over which we have more direct control, were those from which there was a less number of deaths registered. These facts are somewhat satisfactory, as they go far to prove that the measures adopted by your Board with the view of preventing the propagation of the more serious forms of zymotic diseases are productive of good results. Smallpox Epidemic. Last year smallpox was, as usual, very much more prevalent in London than in any other town in England. This is a remarkable fact. It is probably due to a combination of causes but chiefly to the very great population of London and the fact that for many years smallpox has infected the locality. The Public Health Acts now existing are not sufficient to insure the effectual isolation of all the cases that occur, and the consequence is that the disease never gets completely stamped out. No improvement in sanitary law in reference to the subject has taken place during the past year. We have had during the past 68 six months of the present year a terrible proof of the necessity of further legislative enactment. The disease has been very prevalent in London, and has caused a great sacrifice of human life. Our Government seems to recognise that improvement in the law on the subject is necessary, but the time of Parliament has been so taken up with other matters of State, that there has been no leisure to attend to the subject. It seems a very great pity that thousands of human lives should be sacrificed in this the greatest City of the World, that mankind should be afflicted with a terrible pest, that millions should have been spent in merely trifling with the disease, and that owing to the present state cf business in the House of Commons there should be very little chance of an improvement in the state of the law. Most sanitarians agree that isolation in hospitals is necessary, in the majority of cases, in order to prevent the disease from spreading. As a matter of fact, a very large proportion of the casv.s that occur annually in London are not properly isolated, and as a consequence the disease continues most seriously to infect this great City. Compulsory registration of all cases, with proper compulsory isolation, appear to be the remedies that would be effectual to prevent the prevalence of the disease. There can be little doubt that compulsory re-vaccination at the public expense would have a most powerful influence in stamping out the disease. As a matter of fact, a person is almost absolutely protected from contracting the complaint if he is thoroughly re-vaccinated. The number of deaths from smallpox last year in London was 475, as compared with 459 the previous year. In this district, however, there was a very considerable decrease in the number of cases as compared with the previous year. It is satisfactory to be able to record that the number of cases in this district has decreased in every consecutive year for the last four years. It can not be doubted but that the strenuous measures adopted by your Board, and the large amount of energy that has been expended to get the cases properly isolated and infected houses immediately and thoroughly disinfected, have been the means of accomplishing these fortunate results. At the time of my writing this report there is a very large amount of the disease in London, but it is satisfactory to be able to record that this district has been during the whole course of the epidemic (taking it as a whole) one of the least affected districts in the Metropolis. Your Board is fully aware of the course that has been adopted. It is only needful, therefore, for me to call your attention to the results; as I submit, the results are only what we might have reasonably expected under the circumstances. During last year only 51 cases of smallpox (males 27, females 24) were reported in this district, against 328, 266 and 166 cases reported in the three years 1877, 1878 and 69 1879 respectively. From the very small number of deaths from smallpox (only one) registered as occurring in a private dwellinghouse last year, we may with certainty conclude that there were very few conccaled cases, while there were about 200 the previous year. Under such circumstances, therefore, it is not surprising that there were so few cases in this district. Of the 51 cases which were reported last year, there were 42 in the parish of Fulham against 133 the previous year; 9 in the parish of Hammersmith against 33 the previous year. This diminution in the number of cases is satisfactory, and particularly so when it is remembered that the epidemic was more prevalent in London as a whole last year than the previous year. These 51 cases occurred in 40 houses in 34 streets. In 27 streets the outbreak was confined to 1 house in each street; 22 cases occurred singly in different houses in different streets. In 7 streets there was more than one house infected in each street. In each of these 7 streets there were 2 houses infected. In 33 houses there was only 1 case in each house. In 7 houses there was more than 1 case in each house. Thus, in 1 house there were 5 cases; in 1 house, 3 cases; and in 5 houses there were 2 cases in each house. Of the 51 persons attacked, 25 had been once vaccinated, 4 had never been vaccinated. In the remaining 22 cases no information as to vaccination was obtained. In no case was evidence obtained that the patient had been re-vaccinated. The ages varied from 2 weeks to 74 years; the average age was 25.2 years. Of the 51 cases 11 deaths were registered, which equals a mortality of 21.6 per cent. This is a somewhat high mortality, but it can not be taken as reliable, for there is always a proportion of cases that are concealed and treated at home. These, for the most part, are the slight cases. The period of illness is only a few days, and the patient almost always recovers. It is from the slight modified cases that the disease frequently spreads. Owing to the trifling symptoms the patient has shown there is very little alarm on the part of the relatives, and commonly no isolation or disinfection is adopted. Under proper precautions there would not be anything like the same chance of the disease being propagated from a modified as from a severe one, but as a matter of fact, the neglect of precautions in the modified cases makes them a means of greater danger than the severe cases that are, as a rule, properly dealt with. Of the 51 cases reported 46 were removed by your Board and properly isolated; 45 were taken to the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham, and 1 to the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Stockwell;5 cases were treated at home. The per centage of cases removed to hospitals was 90.2, as compared with a per centage of 83.8 in 70 1879 the previous year. This shows an improvement in the proportion of removals last year. It should be observed that the per centage of removals has increased each year for the last four years. In the year 1878, notwithstanding the fact that most energetic efforts were made to get cases removed to hospitals, only 507 of the reported cases were removed. It is certainly very satisfactory to notice that official influence should have so far increased that the per centage of removals should have risen to 90.2. It is probable also that the per centage of concealed cases has greatly decreased, for as I have before stated, there was only I death from smallpox registered last year as occurring out of the Smallpox Hospital. Of the 42 cases reported in the parish of Fulham, 39 were removed to a hospital and properly isolated; 3 were treated at home and not properly isolated. Of the 9 in the parish of Hammersmith, 7 were removed to a hospital and properly isolated; 2 were treated at home and not properly isolated. Thus, of the cases reported in Fulham, 92.9 per cent. were properly isolated, and of those in Hammersmith 77'8. The actual number of cases reported in Hammersmith is, however, too small for this per centage to be of much practical significance. It is more than probable also that there was a larger proportion of concealed cases in the parish of Fulham last year than there was in the parish of Hammersmith. The medical men in the latter parish showed a strong inclination to assist in the adoption of a proper system of isolation; such was not altogether the case in the parish of Fulham. Still, however, the most valuable assistance was received from the leading medical men in the district. The parish of Fulham owes a debt of gratitude to Drs. Daniell and Murdoch for the very valuable assistance they have on numerous occasions rendered during the prevalenceof the smallpox epidemic. I will only state that I wish some other medical men in the same parish would take a lesson from the wise and professional course that has been adopted by these gentlemen. Of the 5 cases that were treated at home, 3 were not reported till after the recovery of the patients. In one case the patient died while the Inspector went to fetch the ambulance, and in one case the patient was too bad to be removed. Out of 37 cases that were reported, in not one single instance did a second person contract the disease after the removal of the first case. On the other hand, from one of the three cases that were treated at home, 3 other persons contracted the disease. The first case, at Chesson Road, was not reported till the sixth day of illness, when the patient was in "articulo mortis." The result was that 4 other persons were afterwards attacked in the same house. At Reargate, also, the first case 71 was not reported till 5 days after the patient was attacked, consequently three other persons contracted the disease. In the case at Kenneth Road the patient was found to be suffering from "variola hemorrhagica," the worst form of smallpox, an always fatal complaint. He had only been married 10 days, so he must have caught the disease about 4 days before his marriage. I saw the case at night, and pronounced it hopeless. I ordered his immediate removal to the hospital, where he died the following morning. The whole surface of his skin was was covered with versicles full of blood, besides which blood was flowing from his ears, eyes, nose and mouth. Last year over £ 100 was directly saved in the maintenance of the smallpox patients through their removal to the Asylum Hospitals, instead of to Highgate. An arrangement was entered into with the Fulham Board of Guardians in the year 1877 that all cases of infectious disease should be removed to the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals, and that your Board should refund to the Board of Guardians the amount charged upon them by the Asylum Board for the maintenance of the patients. A very large proportion of the patients removed by your Board were paupers, consequently it seems rather absurd that your Board should do all the work and refund to the Board of Guardians the expenses for the maintenance of paupers; still, so many have been the difficulties in dealing with the question of the Guardians removing cases, that on the whole it seems to be the only way of meeting the case, having due regard to the public safety. In the parish of Kensington there has not been the difficulty experienced that has been met with in this district. In that parish the Guardians remove all the cases and make no charge to the Sanitary Authorities. In accordance with the provisions of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1879, application has been made to the Local Authorities of London by the Metropolitan Asylum Board, asking them as to what terms of contract they would be willing to enter upon with the view of sending non-pauper cases of infectious disease into the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals. No definite terms of contract have, as yet, been arranged, but as a matter of fact most, if not all, of the Sanitary Authorities have been sending patients into the Asylum Hospitals. TABLE.

It is interesting to observe that the epidemic is always worse during the first six: months of the year. This fact is probably due to some unknown epidemic influence that exists during the first half of the year, though it is difficult to explain what that influence is.

Fulham Smallpox Hospital. On the the 27th of November last the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Seagrave Road, in the parish of Fulham, was closed for a short period. It was in use for the reception of cases of smallpox during the whole of the rest of the year. At the end of last year there were 15 cases of smallpox remaining in the 74 hospital, and at the end of the previous year 20. Altogether last year there were 315 admissions from 13 unions; 252 were acutc cases, and 55 were partially recovered cases of smallpox, the latter having been admitted from other hospitals;8 were not cases of smallpox;237 patients were discharged cured; 48 died, leaving 52 under treatment, of which 37 were removed convalescent, and 15 were acute cases remaining under treatment on December 31st last. The total mortality per cent. was 16.21. The mortality in those cases in which the patients had been once vaccinated was 11.79; in those in which it was doubtful whether the patients had been vaccinated 25.00; and in those in which vaccination had never been performed successfully 40.32. The facts are conclusive evidence of the very great value of vaccination. The following table shows the number of acute cases of smallpox admitted in the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham during the year 1880; also the number of cases vaccinated, doubtful, and unvaccinated, with the Unions from which they were admitted:— Union or Parish.

In my table of the cases removed from this district, it may be observed that the number is 46, one case having been taken to the Metropolitan Asylum 75 Hospital at Stockwell. It may be noticed that the greatest number of cases was received into the hospital from St. Mary's Parish, Islington. Then comes the Fulham district and then St. Mary's Kensington. I had the honour of presenting to you a Special Report upon the "Hospital Infection Question." In that report I dealt somewhat fully with the subject. The following are the conclusions to which I have arrived:— (1) That in a crowdcd city the presence in a district of a large smallpox hospital receiving cases from a number of other districts is almost sure to be the cause of the disease being more prevalent in the district than it otherwise would be without the presence of the hospital. (2) That the disease does not spread from a smallpox hospital by the diseased particles being carried long distances through the air, and that scientific evidence on the subject as yet adduced is against the probability of the disease being carried through the air for a longer distance than 90 feet. (3) That it is chiefly by indirect means that a smallpox hospital is the cause of the disease being more prevalent in a district. (4) That there is always a probability of the disease being spread to a slight extent by officials, no matter how stringent the regulations may be. (5) That in the removal of cases the disease may be spread by officials who have neglected to use proper precautions to disinfect themselves. (6) That nurses and other persons employed in attending upon the patients may be the means of spreading the disease if they are allowed to leave the hospital enclosure. (7) That letters sent out of the hospital may be the means of communicating the disease. (8) That under proper management and stringent regulations' these causes of danger are reduced to a minimum. (9) That the disease is very liable to be introduced into a district where a smallpox hospital exists, by means of infected persons coming from infected houses to the locality of the hospital for the purpose of makingenquiries or seeing relatives who are dying. (10) That the very large majority of the cases of smallpox that occur in any district are contracted from other cases that have been concealed and treated at home within the district. (11) That it is detrimental to a patient's chance of recovery to be treated in a hospital with a large number (over 50) of 76 other cases, for under such circumstances the atmosphere is liable to become much polluted with the impure exhalations from the patients. (12) That as smallpox is a disease which is accompanied with great prostration, the severe cases ought not to be removed long distances. (13) That each district ought to be provided with a hospital or hospitals for the proper isolation of all cases of infectious diseases occurring within its area, which cases can not with safety be treated at home. (14) That there would be much less danger of the disease being spread through a number (one to each district) of small hospitals, under proper regulations and management, than there is with the several large hospitals now in use in the Metropolis. Scarlet Fever. During last year scarlet fever was more prevalent in London than in the previous year. From this disease there were 3073 deaths registered in London last year against 2706 in the previous year. In the Fulham district, however, there was a decrease in the number of persons attacked. The number of deaths registered last year was 37, against 92 in the year 1879. Altogether last year there were 152 cases reported against 180 and 248 in the years 1879 and 1878 respectively. These numbers only represent a proportion of the cases that actually take place, as it is but in exceptional instances that any information is obtained. Of the 152 cases reported last year, there were 85 in the parish of Hammersmith against 92 in the previous year, and 67 in the parish of Fulham against 88 in the previous year. Information of 37 cases was obtained in the death returns, which was, in most instances, the first report of the case. Your Board removed 20 cases to hospitals, 8 to the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Deptford, and 12 to the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Stockwell. The remaining 95 patients either refused to allow removal or their cases were not reported till after their recovery. In a large proportion of instances the isolation was not sufficient to prevent the disease from spreading, but was not sufficiently bad, having regard to the present state of the law, to justify an application to the magistrate to enforce removal. These cases ought not to be removed such long distances as to Stockwell and Deptford, as the fatigue of a long journey must exhaust a patient and so lessen his chance of recovery. Each district ought to be provided with a hospital for the proper 77 isolation of this disease. In all the 152 cases reported a most careful system of disinfection was carried out by your Inspectors. It may fairly be estimated that there were about 740 persons attacked by the disease in this district last year, while there were only 152 cases reported. It must be evident, under such circumstances, that the measures adopted by your Board, although they were complete as far as they went, nevertheless, could not be effectual in stamping out the disease. Diphtheria. Of the 5 deaths from diphtheria, there were three in the parish of Fulham and 2 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 10 cases registered the previous year, of which there were 4 in the parish of Fulham and 6 in the parish of Hammersmith. None of these cases were reported till after death. Careful enquiries were made in each case, but the origin of the outbreak was not discovered. In no case was evidence obtained that a second person contracted the disease in the same house. It is not unlikely, therefore, that some of these cases were not true diphtheria, as true diphtheria is a most contagious disease. Whooping Cough. Of the 128 deaths registered from whooping cough, there were 46 in the parish of Fulham and 82 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 71 deaths registered during the previousyear, of which there were 31 in the parish of Fulham and 40 in the parish of Hammersmith. With the exception of diarrhoea, whooping cough was the zymotic disease from which the greatest number of deaths were registered in London last year, there being 3438 fatal cases. In this district, also, it was the complaint from which the second largest number of deaths was registered, diarrhoea, as usual, representing the greatest number. It is greatly to be regretted that a more perfect system of isolation in the treatment of whooping cough is not adopted. Most persons look upon the disease as a necessary evil, and take no precautions to prevent it from spreading. Besides the enormous number of deaths registered from the disease annually, there is a large number of children whose constitutions are injured through an attack of the disease. With a proper system of isolation adopted a large amount of the disease would never occur. Typhus Fever. Of the 3 deaths registered as typhus fever, there were 2 in the parish of Fulham and 1 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 78 2 registered as typhus the previous year, of which there was one in the parish of Fulham and one in the parish of Hammersmith. From enquiries made after death, it is most doubtful whether any of these deaths were due to true typhus fever. As a matter of fact, in no case did the disease spread, while typhus fever is about the most infectious disease in existence. Enteric, or Typhoid Fever. Of the 7 deaths from typhoid fever, there were 3 in the parish of Fulham and 4 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 20 cases registered the previous year, of which there were 11 in the parish of Fulham and 9 in the parish of Hammersmith. None of these cases were reported till after death. The very small number of deaths from this disease is strong evidence of the great good that has been done by the proper drainage of the district; it is also a proof of the very excellent system of drainage that has been provided for the locality. The system of ventilation of the sewers of London by means of openings in the centre of roads is highly objectionable. Shafts ought to be provided for carrying the gas up above the levels of private houses, where it would become diluted, and so less injurious to health. Measles. During last year 99 cases of measles were reported, 52 in the parish of Fulham and 47 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 56 cases in the previous year, of which there were 36 in the parish of Fulham and 20 in the parish of Hammersmith. In the second quarter of last year a somewhat serious outbreak of the disease took place in Fulham New Town. It was chiefly confined to 4 streets. Scarcely any isolation or sanitary precaution was adopted until the cases were discovered by a house to house visitation made by your Inspector. Your Board are able to exercise very little control over the spreading of this disease, for, as in the case of whooping cough, the complaint is thought so lightly of, that isolation is neglected, and consequently a large number of lives are lost that might otherwise be saved. Simple Continued Fever. Of the three deaths from simple continued fever, there was one in the parish of Fulham and 2 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 2 cases registered the previous year, which were both in the parish of Hammersmith. None of these cases were reported before death. It is very satisfactory to record so few cases of this disease, as it is generally produced by a vitiated atmosphere. 79 Diarrhœa. Of the 135 deaths from diarrhoea, there were 63 in the parish of Fulham and 72 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 83 the previous year, of which there were 35 in the parish of Fulham and 48 in the parish of Hammersmith. The increase in the number of these deaths was, as has been before stated, due to warm summer. During a large portion of the summer months there was a great scarcity of rain fall, consequently the sewers were not well flushed. Under such circumstances large quantities of impure gas is given off, by which diarrhoea is in warm weather frequently produced. English Cholera. There were 4 deaths registered from English cholera, 2 in the parish of Fulham and 2 in the parish of Hammersmith, against one death in the parish of Fulham the previous year. These are only severe forms of simple diarrhoea. They are not, in the true sense of the word, infectious diseases. Violent Deaths and Inquests. There were 84 deaths from violence, of which there were 25 in the parish of Fulham and 59 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 71 in the previous year, of which there were 28 in the parish of Fulham and 43 in the parish of Hammersmith. There were 167 inquests held, against 154 the previous year. Some increase in these deaths is only what might be expected with so great an increase in the population by immigration. Deaths in Public Institutions. There were 221 deaths registered in public institutions, of which there were 50 in St. Paul's, against 40 the previous year, and 171 in Fulham against 232 the previous year. Of the 50 in St. Paul's, there were 46 in the West London Hospital (34 males and 12 females);4 (males) in the Wormwood Scrubs Convict Prison. Of the 171 in the parish of Fulham, 122 took place at the Fulham Workhouse (68 males and 54 females); 47 in the Metropolitan Asylum Hospital at Fulham (23 males and 24 females; and 2 (females) at the Female Convict Prison in Fulham Old Town. Piggeries. The piggeries now remaining in the district are chiefly confined to Latymer Road. There are only 3 places in which swine 8o arc kept in the parish of Fulham; in one of these a magistrate's order was obtained in the year 1879, prohibiting pigs from being kept on the premises. In this case the defendant owner gave notice of appeal, but afterwards withdrew from the case on the understanding that your Board would take no further action till after the 1st of June of the present year. The magisterial orders obtained against all the other cases have been complied with. The parish of Fulham is therefore now almost free from this most objectionable nuisance. In the parish of Hammersmith there arc still many hundreds of swine kept in a locality totally unfit for the business of pig keeping, and what is still worse the animals arc kept in a most dirty and revolting condition. This most objectionable nuisance does not exist becausc your Board arc unwilling to stop it, or because you do not recognise the serious consequences of its continuance. Last year 29 summonses were taken out by your instructions against the pig-keepers of Latymer Road. Over 40 persons residing in the immediate neighbourhood of the piggeries promised to give evidence in support of the prosecution. Strange to say, at the hearing of the cases nearly all the witnesses, although called for the prosecution, gave evidence to the effect that no nuisance had existed. They had previously stated on deposition to your solicitors that the nuisance was of the worst possible description. The magistrate was evidently of opinion that the nuisance did exist. Also that it was perfectly right and justifiable of your Board to have taken the proceedings, but he pointed out that he could not grant orders in the face of such evidence as was called for the prosecution. He suggested that you should take fresh proceedings on some future occasion, and he made no order as to costs. The counsel for the defence was not called upon to plead; he did not ask for costs, but was content to win the case on the evidence of the prosecution. The result was that each side paid its own costs. It is greatly to be regretted that this evil still exists. As I stated to you in my third Quarterly Report, 1880—"I have no hesitation in giving it as my opinion, after due and careful consideration, that hundreds of human lives have been, directly and indirectly, sacrificed through the keeping of swine in the Latymer Road. During last quarter no less a number than 47 deaths occurred in that locality. Of these 21 died in the Latymer Road, the remainder in streets closely adjaccnt to the piggeries; 19 of the total 47 deaths were from zymotic diseases. The per centage of deaths from zymotic diseases as compared with the total deaths was 42.6, while the per centage in the whole district was 26.0. One of the pigkeepers himself died from chronic diarrhoea during last quarter. 81 Chronic diarrhoea is a disease that is almost always produced by breathing a polluted atmosphere." It is needless for me to present further statistics to show the unhealthiness of that locality, for how could it be otherwise than unhealthy when the whole atmosphere of the neighbourhood is reeking with stench. As a matter of fact, in hot weather it is impossible to walk down Latymer Road without perceiving the offensive state of the atmosphere. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that diseased bioplasm, or diseased germs, should there find a pabulum in which to live, retain full vitality, and propagate their species. So great is the atmospheric pollution in that locality, that as I am informed many hundreds of the pigs themselves have been attacked with scarlet or typhoid fever, and have either died or have been slaughtered, to save them from a natural death. I have no evidence before me as to what was done with the flesh of these animals. Without doubt such meat ought not to be used for human consumption. Licensed Cow Houses. A great deal was done in improving the condition of the licensed cow houses within this district last year. At the October meeting of the Justices at Kensington Sessions the Bench supported all the requirements of your Board. Each licence was endorsed with the number of cows that might be lawfully kept upon the premises for which it was held. An area of 800 cubic feet was required for each cow. In one case the licence was refused because a licensee was unwilling to conform with your requirements. He submitted to the Bench that they were unreasonable and unnecessary, but when, after personal inspection the magistrates decided otherwise, he informed them that he was unwilling to comply. In two cases licences were granted through some clerical mistake, the premises being in a most defective sanitary condition. In one case the licence was granted upon the understanding that the requirements would be carried out. The promise has not been fulfilled. A great deal of difficulty was experienced owing to the fact that the cowkeepers did not clearly comprehend the law on the subject. I hey seemed to suppose that because they were required to be registered by the Metropolitan Board of Works under the Contagious Disease (Animals) Act, 1878, that therefore the jurisdiction of your Board under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862, was repealed. they did not seem to be able to understand that under the Metropolis Local ;Management Act, 1862, they were required to be licensed, your Board being the Local 82 authority under that Act, and that they were also obliged, in most instances, to be registered under the Contagious Disease (Animals) Act, 1878, the Metropolitan Board of Works being the Local authority for the purposes of that Act. In several instances they submitted to the Bench that as the Metropolitan Board of Works were satisfied with the condition of their premises, the opposition of your Board to their being licenced should be disregarded. The Bench were of opinion that they could not deal with this question ; but having heard the evidence as to the grounds of your opposition they, in every case, gave judgment in your favour. It is greatly to be regretted that these cases should come before the Bench. We see that at one time they support all the requirements of the Sanitary Authorities, at another they decide that the same requirements are unnecessary, and refuse to support them. It would be far more satisfactory if the granting of these licences was left to the jurisdiction of the Sanitary Authorities. The following table shows the licenced cow-houses in the Fulham district, the amount of air space in each, and the number of cows for which they are licenced :— Parish of Fulham.

Groves, McLean & Co., and Timothy Brosman, were granted last April. In both of these cases your Board opposed the applications. In that of Messrs. Groves and Co., it was my opinion that the situation of the shed was such that it was totally unfit to be licenced. It would be impossible to find a more unsuitable situation, or one in which the presence of a cow-shed would be more detrimental to the health of the surrounding inhabitants. In the other case the licence was opposed by your Board on the grounds that the usual regulations had not been complied with. The Bench, however, for some unaccountable reasons, granted both of the licences in these cases. In the one case they decided that the situation was unobjectionable for the purpose of a cowshed and in the other case that the usual regulations, with the exception of one which the applicant had not adopted, were unnecessary. Although he had not complied with this regulation which they admitted to be necessary, they granted the licence, and simply 84 told him that he must conform in this particular. He has since failed to comply with the regulation, and his premises are in as unsanitary condition as they would have been had he been able to keep cows without a licence. Under such circumstances it is difficult to see what advantage arises from a cow-keeper being obliged to take out a licence. Slaughter Houses. The slaughter houses in the district are 25 in number, 7 in the parish of Fulham and 19 in the parish of Hammersmith. They were kept under regular inspection during last year. In most instances they were found to be well conducted in accordance with the requirements of your Board. In a few instances sanitary defects were discovered, besides which some improvements were deemed to be necessary. Notice were served upon several of the licensees, all of which were complied with. On October 5th the whole of the licences were renewed, to which your Board offered no opposition. No fresh application was made last year for establishing a new slaughter house. The subjoined table gives the slaughter houses in this district:— Parish of Hammersmith. Situation of Slaughter Houses.

No factory inspectors having, as yet, been appointed to visit bakehouses under the Factory Act, 1878, I have deemed it advisable that the inspectors of your Board should still carry on the work, as if the Bakehouse Regulation Act was not repealed. Where sanitary defects were found to exist, notices were served upon the occupiers under the provisions of the Nuisance Removal Act, 1855. The Case of Frank Isworth. The case of Frank Isworth though, in one sense, unfortunate, nevertheless reflected great credit upon your Sanitary Department for the careful perseverance in the execution of a duty under very trying and difficult circumstances. His death created a great deal of public sympathy. Many of the public papers commented upon the case, and suggested that there was something wrong somewhere, but they took care to exonerate every one from blame who was connected with the affair. The papers received an untrue and sensational report of what took place at the inquest. The remarks that were made by the Coroner were, "that there was no blame to any one in the case, and that from the beginning to the end the wisest possible course had been adopted." As a matter of fact, there was nothing wrong anywhere, except in the unfortunate individual himself. After 36 applications to the Police Court, and over 100 visits to the house, 63, Harwood Road, in the parish of Fulham, the dwelling was at length closed under a magistrate's order. The last occupier, Frank Isworth, was removed to Coldbath Fields Prison in default of the payment of fines incurred for refusing to quit the house 86 in accordancc with the magistrate's order. I had pronounced the house as unfit for human habitation several months before, at a time when there was a number of families residing in it. It was necessary, therefore, as no owner of the premises could be found, that the house should be closed in order to protect the lives of the persons who were occupying it. There can be no doubt that other lives would have been sacrificed but for the action taken. Had it been legally possible to remove Frank Isworth at the time when I first condemned the house his life might also have been saved. He determined, however, to defy the law, regardless of consequences, and persistently refused to leave. Numerous applications were made to the magistrates to enforce the order, but owing to the great press of business at the Court and the reluctance on the part of the magistrates to enforce the law, further action was delayed from time to time for several months. All this time the defendant, his wife and children, were residing in the vitiated atmosphere of the house. On one occasion I applied personally to the magistrate, and informed him that it was a question of human life, and that the children looked as if they were dying. The press of business at the Court outweighed my statements, and the result was, that at length, when the defendant was removed, he had become so ill from the combined effects of poverty and a vitiated atmosphere, that he died three days after he was taken to prison. A great sensation was created because he died in prison, but surely the comfortable ward of a prison infirmary was preferable to a house containing nothing but an atmosphere recking with stench. It was not known as a fact that he was ill. Had he complained to the warrant officer he would have been at once taken to a hospital or the workhouse. Dust Heaps. During last year there were many complaints made of nuisances occasioned by large accumulations of house refuse deposited in fields for the purpose of brick making. No legal action was taken by your Board in these cases. It was found that the contractors were willing, as far as was practicable, to carry out the regulations that were issued. They were required not to burn, but to at once bury all the soft core. The precautions had the effect of so far lessening the nuisance that the inhabitants ceased to complain. Sanitary Work. A very large amount of sanitary work was got through in the 87 course of last year. Improvement has taken place in the manner in which the several inspectors performed their duties. More regularity in the inspection of the district would be of advantage ; still, so much of the time of these officers has been taken up with special prosecutions, that the regular and systematic inspection of the district could not be performed in quite a satisfactory manner. Water and Water Supply. The water supply of this district is chiefly obtained from two companies, the Chelsea and the West Middlesex. The average amount of water supplied daily to each house during the year was, Chelsea 239 gallons, and West Middlesex 166 gallons. These amounts are more than sufficient for all domestic purposes. The mean amount of organic carbon was '212 in 100,000) parts of water in that supplied by the Chelsea Company, and '243 in that supplied by the West Middlesex. According to the report of Dr. Frankland, from which these particulars are taken, the waters abstracted from the Thames were more polluted by organic matter last year than they have been ever since these analyses have been made. "The nearest approach to this degree of pollution was reached in the year 1872, but at this time the several companies were provided with far less efficient apparatus for filtration than at present, so that the actual pollution of the unfiltered Thames water during last year must have been even still more strikingly in excess of that of previous years. Owing to the flooded condition of the river, even in summer, much filthy matter from sewers, cesspools and cultivated fields was swept into it during these periods of the year, when, through absence of heavy rain, they do not usually reach the river." Of the waters taken from the Thames, the best average supplies were furnished by the Chelsea and West Middlesex Companies ; the water of the latter company, however, showed the highest maximum, as well as the lowest minimum, pollution. The temperature of the Thames water varied from 36 8 degs. Fahrenheit in January to 68.0 degs. in August. The mean amount of solid matter in 100,000 parts of the water supplied by the Chelsea and West Middlesex Companies was 28.02 and 28.36 respectively. The solid matter was composed of a variety of substances, by far the largest proportion being entirely harmless, when the water was used for dietetic purposes, but decidedly objectionable when it was used for washing, because the water was thereby rendered hard. Although the amount of organic pollution was greater last year 88 than has been previously registered, the total amount of solid matter in the Chelsea and West Middlesex Companies' waters was slightly less than in the previous year. Both of these companies have greatly improved their works. The reason why the quality of the water has not been improved is, because the weather has been, during the last three years, unexceptionally unfavourable and the condition of the Thames water, before filtration, particularly bad. Meteorology. The mean reading of the barometer during last year was 29.810 inches. The highest temperature by day was 87.5 degs. Fahrenheit in May. The lowest temperature by night was 17.2 degs. Fahrenheit in January. The mean temperature for the year was 49.4 degs. Fahrenheit. Rain fell on 158 days. The total rain fall was 29.68 inches. Disinfecting Apparatus. The disinfecting apparatus has now been in use for a period of nearly three years, and it has continued to work in a most satisfactory manner. Some hundreds of infected articles were disinfected duringlast year. Nocomplaints have been received that they were at all injured by the process, nor has any outbreak of disease been known to occur from using them. In conclusion, I beg to thank your Board for the confidence you have been pleased to place in my opinion and for the manner in which you have adopted all my recommendations. It is an encouragement for a public officer to feel that he possesses the unanimous confidence of the Board for whom his advice is retained, besides which it is a great advantage for the efficient execution of his duty for him to know that his judgment will be relied upon. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. Capstone House, Hammersmith.
