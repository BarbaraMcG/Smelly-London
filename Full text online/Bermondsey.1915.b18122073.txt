SPA ROAD, S.E, Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Fifteenth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Borough of Bermondsey during the year 1915. The death-rate was 21.4, compared with 17.6 in 1914 and 17.98 in 1913, which was the only occasion in which it was lower than the year under report. The increase in the death-rate is discussed in an early section. The sections of the report are, as usual, divided into: — I. —Vital Statistics. II.—Notification of Infectious Diseases. III.—Sanitary Administration. IV.—Factories and Workshops. In the Appendix will be found the Local Government Board Tables, including a special Table on Infantile Mortality. Since writing my last report we lost the remainder of our permanent clerical staff, as Mr. Bush, the senior clerk, joined His Majesty's Forces early in the year, and the office lad found a better situation. Their places have now been filled by temporary staff, but, as explained in the last report, the temporary staff, no matter how willing, cannot replace the permanent staff, but notwithstand- ing the absence of the latter, the work has been kept going fairly well, though it is somewhat behindhand. Delay has also been caused by difficulty in getting printing work done. Again, I may record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordiality and co-operation throughout the year. Thanks are also due to the members of the staff for their hearty co-operation in carrying out the various duties devolving on the Public Health Department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. KING BROWN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The populations of the Borough of Bermondsey and its registration sub-districts, as enumerated in the Census of 1901 and 1911, and the estimate of the year under report, are as follows:— 1901. 1911. Estimated to June 30th,1915 Bermondsey 82,483 81,959 77,155 Rotherhithe 38,460 35,247 32,194 St. Olave 9,817 8,697 7,839 Borough 130,760 125,903 117,188 Owing to the absence of so many of the male members of the population on military service, great difficulty was experienced in coming to an estimate of the civil population for 1915. According to the ordinary method of estimation the total population of the Borough would have been 124,029. This is obviously not correct, so the Registrar-General came to our aid with an estimate based on the National Register for the year 1915 of 117,188. The method by which he arrived at this conclusion is as follows: — "The ratio of the total population less the males aged 15-65 years to the number of females aged 15-65 years at the date of the census was calculated for each administrative area, and this was applied to the number of females on the National Register; the resulting product plus the number of males aged 15-65 years on the National Register was taken to be the number of the Civil population of the district. A small adjustment was necessary in order to make the sum of the estimates for the several districts equal to the estimate for the country as a whole made on the same basis. Further, the population in institutions was not registered, and this (taken to be the same in the aggregate for England and Wales as at census date) together with a number of persons of no fixed abode were distributed evenly over the whole country. These two adjustments raised the original estimates by about 1 per cent. “The question of the population to be used for the calculation of birth rates has also required consideration. The births registered are not only those of the children of civilians, and the estimates of civil population, therefore, form an unsuitable basis for the calculation of birth-rates. It is impossible to frame any estimate that would give reliable birth-rates, and it is suggested, therefore, that the birth-rates for 1915 be based upon the existing estimates of total population for 1914. These will sometimes be seriously in error owing to extensive migration having occurred. Although in such cases the Registrar-General does not possess the local information necessary for applying any correction, it is not suggested that this fact need preclude Medical Officers of Health from making use of their opportunities in this direction. “Difficulties, which will probably prove insoluble, remain as to estimation of populations in sex and age groups and the standardising factors dependent upon them. Moreover, the present method of estimation will obviously not apply to 1916 or subsequent years unless the National Register is effectively kept up to date or further enumeration made. Nothing can at present be decided as to these matters." As pointed out in this memorandum, fresh factors will have to be taken into consideration for estimating the population for 1916, and it will hardly be possible to return to the ordinary method of calculation until the war is over, and even then I do not think that anything short of a fresh census enumeration will give us anything like reliable statistics; for the war has produced not only a reduction of the population among certain classes, but a considerable shifting of the population from one district to the other in connection with munitions and other work. One of the causes which in other years we cited as reducing the population in Bermondsey, namely, the doing away of slum property and the erection of factories and warehouses in its place has ceased for the moment to be operative. Now, while this new estimate of population is the proper one to reckon the deaths on, it is not altogether correct as regards the births since these belong both to the civil and military population In calculating the birth-rate, therefore, I am turning to the old method of estimating the population, and have taken the larger figures. Births. The total number of births registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ended January 1st, 1916, was 3,482, consisting of 1,756 males and 1,726 females. This is 262 below the average for the last 10 years, and 275 below the figure for 1914. This total includes 2,306 for Bermondsey, being 196 below that for 1914, and 345 below the average for the last 10 years; 991 for Rotherhithe, being 41 below the number for 1914, and 88 below the average for the last 10 years; and 185 for St. Olave, being 47 below the number for 1914 and 59 below the average for the last 10 years. In Table II. of the Appendix will be seen the figures for the last 10 years in the three registration sub-districts, and in Table I. figures for the whole Borough. The birth-rate for 1915 was 29-6 per thousand persons living, which is 0.8 below that for 1914 and 1.7 below the average for the last 10 years. Particulars of rates will be found in annexed Table A. London is included for comparison. A new departure with regard to births was made by the Registrar -General in 1906. The births are corrected by distributing those which occurred in the chief lying-in hospitals of the Metropolis to the Boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission Those allocated to Bermondsey in 1915 number 28, and if they are added to the above total the rate would be 29.9.

Marriages. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1915 was 1,714, being 478 above the number for 1914, and 577 above the average for the last 10 years. This increase in the number of marriages during 1915 is very remarkable, and is probably due, first, to the greatly increased prosperity of the working classes owing to the large number of War Office contracts being done in or within easy reach of the Borough; second, to the separation allowances in the Army, many young men who were hesitating about getting married did so on being accepted in the Army, so that their wives might get their separation allowances; and, lastly, there may be a certain amount of sentiment about girls marrying soldiers. In Table VIII. of the Appendix will be found particulars of numbers and rates in the three Registration Sub-districts. The numbers have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. Deaths. In Table IV. of Appendix will be found the Local Government Board tables dealing with deaths in the Borough. The extended table of causes of death initiated in 1904 will also be found in the Appendix. The total number of deaths registered in the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1915, was 2,053, which is 359 more than in 1914, and 168 less than the average for the last 10 years. When this figure is corrected by exclusion of deaths of nonparishioners occurring in the district, and the inclusion of deaths of parishioners occurring outside the district, the number is raised to 2,514. This is 330 more than in 1914, and 195 more than the average for the last 10 years. The annexed table shows the distribution of deaths in quarters, together with the corresponding quarters of 1914. The largest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year. TABLE B.—DEATHS. Quarter. St. Olave. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe.

This increase in the deathrate is partly real and partly apparent. As shown in an early section (vide page 8) the civil population was estimated by the Registrar -General as 117,000, against the normal population of 124,000, and as the military population consisted of healthy males whose mortality is very low, the increase of the rate from a statistical point of view had to be borne by the civil population left behind. The death-rate on a population of 124,000 would have been about 20.3. TABLE C.—DEATH RATES. Rotherhithe. Whole Borough. Bermondsey. London. Year.

Measles, whooping cough, respiratory and tubercular diseases are chiefly accountable for the increase. In column 1, foot of Table I. of the Appendix, will be found a list of places where deaths of non-parishioners occurred in the district. There were 38 such deaths in all, against 26 in 1914, and 21 in 1913. 21 such deaths occurred in the infirmary; 1 in the workhouse; 8 in River Thames; 7in Surrey Commercial Docks; and 1 in Horseferry Dry Dock. 542 persons belonging to this Borough died in outlying institutions, against 516 in 1914, and 534 in 1913. The names of the various places where the deaths occurred will be found in columns 2 and 3 at foot of Table I. of Appendix. Infantile Mortality. An infantile mortality of 154 per 1,000 births is high compared with the previous 8 years. On comparing Table V. of Appendix with the corresponding table of 1914 it will be seen that the mortality under one month for 1915 is 137, against 152 for 1914. In the period 1-3 months the figures are identical, but in the three periods included in the interval 3-12 months those of 1915, viz., 297 against 232 for 1914, show that the causes of the increase are only operative after the first three months of life. A further examination of the table will show that the increase is almost entirely due to the larger number of deaths from measles, whooping cough, pneumonia and bronchitis. The decrease in 1915 under 3 months is very satisfactory, as it shows that the ordinary ante-natal and natal influences which produce premature birth, atrophy, debility, etc., were not particularly at work, and that the increase during the late months of the first year is largely due to infection introduced from without the Borough, and the cold, damp winter and spring within, increasing the prevalence of measles, whooping cough and respiratory diseases respectively. Neglect of infants by so many mothers going prematurely to work after confinement may partly account for the increased mortality, though this might be expected to operate in a marked manner between 1 and 3 months old, but the absence of an increase during this period largely discounts this as a cause. 624 155 16,307 130 1906 408 115 170 156 46 178 335 125 144 130 22 96 501 125 14,114 116 1907 411 147 151 134 48 186 610 146 13,943 113 1908 1909 396 144 143 134 34 137 573 141 12,582 108 1910 341 128 135 130 26 101 502 127 11,809 103 1911 403 159 167 157 166 611 159 14,440 129 41 1912 290 116 113 106 30 129 433 114 10,056 91 1913 357 140 118 110 30 136 505 131 11,869 105 1914 335 133 116 113 36 160 487 129 11,395 104 135 35 145 547 137 13,283 112 Average for years 1905-1914 142 369 131 1915 349 151 153 154 35 189 537 154 11,369 104 TABLE G.—DEATHS FROM ZYMOTIC DISEASES, 1915.

There has been an increase in the deaths from these diseases, the figures being 367, against 262 in the previous year, and 307 the average for the last ten years. This gives a zymotic death-rate of 3.13. The total number of deaths from notifiable diseases, viz., scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus fever and enteric fever, was 32, compared with 28 in 1914, and for the non-notifiable, viz., measles, whooping cough and diarrhoea, 335 compared with 234 in the previous year. Small-pox. There were no deaths from this cause in 1915. Measles. There were 110 deaths due to this disease, which is 14 above the average for the last ten years, and 31 above the number for 1914. The deaths occurred in quarters as follows, viz.:— 52, 42, 5, 1. Whooping Cough. 79 deaths were due to this cause, against 14 in 1914. The deaths occurred in quarters as follows:— 46, 26, 4, 3. Typhus Fever. No deaths occurred from this disease. Enteric Fever. 3 deaths were due to this cause, 1 in Bermondsey and 2 in Rotherhithe. The corresponding figures for 1914 were 2 for the Borough, viz., both in Bermondsey. Senile Mortality. The number of deaths over 65 years of age in 1915 was 544 compared with 500 in 1914. Death Certification. There were no uncertified deaths in 1915 B Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from all forms of tubercular disease in 1915 was 303, against 262 in 1914. This figure comprises 209 for Bermondsey, 72 for Rotherhithe, and 22 for St. Olave. Of these, 226 were due to phthisis and 77 to the other tubercular diseases. Phthisis. In Table J will be found particulars of deaths from phthisis since the year 1905. There were 233 deaths due to this cause, which is 30 more than the number recorded in the previous year.

This number gives a very small idea of the deaths caused by these diseases, since they are often the remote causes of death, and are not always mentioned on the certificate for various reasons. Cancer. 134 deaths were attributed to this cause. The Cancer Research Commission have not yet issued their final report on the subject. Heart Diseases. 205 deaths were due to this cause, which number is 17 above that for the previous year. This refers to organic or valvular disease of the heart. Suicides. 13 persons committed suicide in 1915, viz., 4 by poison, 4 by hanging or strangulation, 2 by drowning, 2 by cutting or piercing instruments, and 1 by jumping from high place. Accidents. 108 deaths were due to accidents, against 88 in the previous year. Particulars will be found in the extended table of the Causes of Death in the Appendix. Other Violent Causes. There was 1 death by homicide during the year under report. There were also 2 deaths caused by air raids, 1 of which took place in the City of London. B2 19 II.—NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE In Table III. of Appendix will be found particulars of infectious diseases notified during the year under report. The number of cases notified, exclusive of notifications of tuberculosis, which numbered 452, was 930, compared with 950 in 1914 and 1,193 in 1913. All the diseases show a decrease on the number for the previous year, with the exception of diphtheria, enteric and cerebro-spinal meningitis, which show an increase of 11, 13 and 15 respectively. The number of cases notified in the registration sub-districts was 635 in Bermondsey, against 641 in 1914, 236 in Rotherhithe, against 261, and 41 in St. Olave, against 48 in 1914. The attack-rate per thousand inhabitants was 7.6, the rate for the sub-districts being 8.2 for Bermondsey, 7.3 for Rotherhithe, and 5.2 for St. Olave. The corresponding rates in the previous year were 9.6 for the Borough, 7.8 for Bermondsey, 7.7 for Rotherhithe and 5.8 for St. Olave. 38 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from the disease for which they were notified, but if allowance is made for mild unreported cases, the recorded notifications would, if anything, understate the actual number of cases. Small-pox. No case of Small-pox was notified formally during the year 1915, but we received an informal notification from the Port Medical Officer of Health, Plymouth, that F. H., of Abbey Buildings, Steward on board the S/S "Umtata," was suffering from small-pox contracted abroad. On investigation, however, this turned out to be incorrect as the person who was suffering gave the above name and address belonging to a friend who resided in Bermondsey, and who was known to be in good health at the time. No further news was heard of the case. Typhus Fever. No cases of typhus fever were notified during the year under report. Diphtheria. There were 225 cases of diphtheria notified in 1915, of which 151 occurred in Bermondsey, 63 in Rotherhithe, and 11 in St. Olave. This is an increase on 1914, for which the figures were: — Borough, 214; Bermondsey, 138; Rotherhithe, 67; and St. Olave, 9. From the following table it will be seen that a slight decrease has taken place throughout London. TABLE K. Cases of Diphtheria Notified. Year. London.

The case mortality was 8·8 per cent., against 7·9 per cent. in 1914 and 6·5 per cent. in 1913. 10 cases were returned as not suffering from this disease. 259 specimens were sent in by medical practitioners for bacteriological examination, against 327 in 1914, and 250 in 1913. Of these 41 were found to contain diphtheria bacilli, all of which were notified. In 1 case of diphtheria the source of infection was attributed to a previous case in the family. The following appeared in the report last year and gives an explanation of the method adopted in this Borough to prevent the spread of this disease: — " Diphtheria is a disease caused by a characteristic bacillus known as the Klebs-Loffler Bacillus, which occurs in the throats of persons attacked by the disease. It seems to be conveyed from person to person by direct contact, and there is no virulent disease which will spread more rapidly under certain circumstances than this will among school children. It is more or less directly conveyed from throat to throat by children passing sweets, slate pencils, and other articles which they are liable to put in their mouths, from one child to another. Kissing an affected person on the mouth will also frequently give rise to the disease, and an infected child coughing in the neighbourhood of non-infected ones will also often transmit the disease to them. Sometimes the bacilli will exist in the throat for a long time without producing any symptoms, but such children, while not suffering themselves, will be liable to convey the infection to others. For this reason they have been called 'carrier' cases, and, as expressed in previous reports, my belief is that a large part of the spread of the disease is due to such cases. Since 1902 an endeavour has been made in this Borough to prevent any of these ' carrier' cases returning to school, and each Annual Report has contained some account of the working of the plan. This consists in getting the parents of a child which is notified as suffering from diphtheria to bring up the other members of the family within a week or so after the removal or recovery of the case to the municipal laboratory at the Town Hall for examination. If diphtheria bacilli are found in the throats they are excluded from school for a fortnight, and if then found to be free, are allowed to return to school." The number of children thus examined in 1915 was 259, belonging to 129 families. Out of this number 12 had diphtheria bacilli in their throats or noses, 2 of whom subsequently developed the clinical symptoms of diphtheria, and were notified. Scarlet Fever. The notifications of scarlet fever in 1915 were 365. Of these 264 occurred in Bermondsey, 88 in Rotherhithe, and 13 in St. Olave. This is a decrease of 203 for the Borough on the total for 1914. The distribution of the disease in the various Wards, as shown in Table III. of Appendix, was fairly uniform. 24 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from scarlet fever. The accompanying chart shows the prevalence of the disease in each of the 52 weeks under report. The average notifications for the past ten years are shown in green. There were 9 deaths, which gives a case mortality of 2·4 per cent., against 1·6 per cent, in 1914. The disease, as in recent years, was of a mild type. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 3·1 against 4·6 in 1914. In 40 cases the source of infection was attributed as follows:— Previous cases in house or family or neighbouring houses ... ... ... ... ... ... 30 School infection ... ... ... ... ... 1 "Return" cases ... ... ... ... ... 7 Second-hand clothes ... ... ... ... ... 1 Infection carried by third person ... ... ... 1 23 In the seven cases classified as "return" cases, the source of infection was presumed to be some other member of the family or occupant of the same house who had returned from hospital after an attack of scarlet fever, within a month previous to the second occurring. The child discharged from the hospital is generally spoken of as the " infecting " case and the infected child as the " return " case. Formerly these "return" cases were a source of great anxiety to the hospital authorities as they were thought to be due to premature discharge after an attack of scarlet fever, but owing to the precautions now taken before discharge, these "return" cases are very few in London. As regards the above seven cases, it is by no means certain that we are correct in attributing the source of infection to the case discharged from hospital. In some of them no doubt this is correct, but in others the occurrence of the second case is a mere coincidence. Measles. The number of deaths for 1915 was 110, against 79 in 1914, 88 in 1913 and 101 in 1912. In the first quarter there were 52 deaths, in the second 52, in the third 5, and in the fourth 1. There was a considerable increase in the number of deaths from measles, but this disease is subject to considerable fluctuations, and as practically every child gets it at some period of its life, it depends largely on the number of susceptible children in a district whether an outbreak is likely to be large or small. Endeavours have been made by means of notification and the application of the sections of the Public Health Act dealing with disinfection, etc., after measles to control the disease, but so far they seem to have little or no effect whatever. At the beginning of the present year, 1916, the Local Government Board again returned to the subject with a modified form of notification, namely, the first case that occurs in the house and also the notification of German Measles. Notification is to be utilised to discover serious cases and see that they are properly nursed, the SCARLET FEVER. Notifications 1915 marked Red. Average 10 years 1904-1913 marked Green. DIPHTHERIA. Average 10 years 1904-1913 marked Green. Notifications 1915 marked Red. ENTERIC FEVER. Notifications 1915 marked Red. Average 10 years 1904-1913 marked Green. idea being rather to reduce the case mortality than to prevent its spread. Whether the results of this plan will justify the outlay only time will tell, and I hope to make a further report on the matter next year. Enteric Fever, 21 cases of enteric fever were notified, being 11 for Bermondsey, 8 for Rotherhithe, and 2 for St. Olave. 4 cases were returned as not suffering, making an actual total of 17. The total number of cases notified in the previous year was 8. Puerperal Fever. 7 cases of puerperal fever were notified. There were 2 deaths. Membranous Croup. No notification of this disease was received during the year under report. Chicken Pox was notifiable between April 7th and June 30th, 1915, during which 141 cases were notified. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. There were 13 cases of this disease notified during the year. Under this heading is included every kind of "sore eyes" occurring in the newly born.' They were all visited by the Health Visitors, who instructed them to immediately seek medical advice. Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. 19 cases of this disease were notified. Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, known as spotted fever, is an acute disease due to a micro-organism known as the meningo-coccus, because it causes acute inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is a very fatal disease and if the patient recovers, he is liable to be afflicted with deafness and blindneśs and various nervous symptoms. Hickman's Folly ... ,, ,, Not fatal 4 A.B.

Uncle a soldier—visited home recently. Investigatios made. The above is a full list of the cases of this disease notified in Bermondsey during 1915. As explained in previous reports there are two forms in this disease. One is the sporadic, which is never absent altogether from the district and is known as Post-Basic Meningitis, and the other is the epidemic form or true cerebro-spinal meningitis. The above cases, no doubt, belong to both forms and it is probable that the majoity of the children are cases of postbasic meningitis. In London these two diseases are looked upon by the medical authorities as one and the same, but in Belfast, where they have had epidemics in recent years on a considerable scale, I am informed by Dr. A. Gardner Robb, the medical superintendent of the Purdysburn Fever Hospital, Belfast, that he considers them from a clinical point of view as separate diseases. In this he is supported by Dr. T. Houston, from the bacteriological standpoint, but the opinion here expressed is not universally accepted. lam inclined to agree with Dr. Robb, but from a practical point of view it does not matter very much about drawing a distinction since the cases of post-basic meningitis are very few and it only means a little extra disinfection and examination of contacts, and it is just possible that if these cases were excluded that genuine cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis might be overlooked. The last column of the table refers to military associations and this was inserted in deference to the view that the disease was imported here by the Canadians who in turn got it from American sources. Only very few cases show any real connection with the military, but one must remember that if you investigate almost any disease from the same point of view you will get just about as much connection with the military as in these cases, because the inhabitants of many of the London boroughs have got many relatives and friends serving at the front. The mortality, shown by above table, is very high, namely 62 per cent., but many of the cases were untreated by serum since death occurred very quickly before anything could be done. Were it possible to have all cases treated early by Flexner's serum the mortality would not be more than about 12 to 15 per cent. Polio-Myelitis. There were 2 cases notified during 1915. This disease is due to an inflammation of the part of the interior nervous substance of the lower part of the brain and of the spinal cord. It is distinct in this way from the last disease in which inflammation of the membranes covering these structures occurs. It is also known as infantile paralysis and occurs in two forms as sporadic and epidemic. The sporadic form constantly exists in this country, but only single cases occur now and then and undoubtedly the two cases notified in Bermondsey belong to this type. The disease is not so fatal as cerebro-spinal meningitis, but it nearly always leaves behind a certain amount of paralysis in the arms or legs. This results often in deformities if the child attacked happens to be at the growing age. The disease is caused by an organism which is " an exceedingly minute globoid body " and was discovered in 1913 by Flexner and Noguchi. This discovery, however, has not yet been universally accepted. The virus of polio-myelitis is so extremely minute that it will pass through the finest earthenware wfilter and this accounts for the difficulty in finding it. BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. The total number of specimens examined in 1915 was 919, compared with 1,087 in 1914, and 1,040 in 1913. TABLE M. Results of Examination. Total Examinations. Nature of Specimen. Positive.

I have always been accustomed to have one or two of the clerical members of the staff trained to assist in the laboratory, but as practically all the clerical staff joined early in the year, the whole work of the laboratory has devolved on me personally. This takes up a considerable amount of time, but has enabled me to effect several improvements in its administration and equipment. 30 SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. Unsound Food.

August 25th — 82 casks of rancid butter deposited for sale. Dismissed. September 15th— Exposing 61 lbs. of unsound black currants for the purpose of sale Owner: fine 40s. or 21 days' imprisonment. February 23rd, 1916 — 825 barrels 50 puncheons and 25 tierces of unsound pork deposited for sale. Owners : fine £20, costs £10 10s. Od. There are two items in the above list which require special mention, viz., that of Rancid Butter under the Unsound Food Regulations and the Hams under the Public Health Act. Rancid Butter. As the above matter is a very important one I make no apology for giving the full report to the Council. In only one case did a food stop lead to legal proceedings, and that was in the case of a large parcel of rancid butter. The following is a special report on the matter: — "On the 21st June, 1915, Mr. Ashdown, Wharves and Food Inspector, found 82 casks of butter which had been imported and was in cold store at Cotton's Wharf, Tooley Street. On examination he found the butter to be rancid and in his opinion unfit for human consumption. This opinion was confirmed by the Medical Officer and also by Mr. Bodmer, the Public Analyst, who analysed the butter and also samples of cake and shortbread which had been made with this butter. The butter belonged to Herman Gosschalk, Ltd., of 40 and 42, Tooley Street. A stop order had been placed on the butter on the 22nd June in accordance with the Unsound Food Regulations of the Local Government Board and eventually a summons was applied for at the Tower Bridge Police Court in order that the magistrate should decide whether the butter was unfit for human consumption. The case was heard before Mr. Chapman c on the 25th August, 1915, Mr. Goff Clark represented the Council and Mr. Kirby appeared for the defendants. The defence was that although the butter might be unsuitable for sale in the ordinary way over the counter, it was quite sound and fit for cooking purposes, 1 .e., making cakes, pastries, confectionery, etc. Mr. Ashdown and Dr. Brown gave evidence in support of the case that the butter was unfit for human consumption directly or indirectly, and Mr. Bodmer corroborated to the extent that it was unsuitable. Dr. Oldfield, Dr. Teed, analytical chemist, Dr. Rideal, consulting chemist, and Mr. Partington, trade expert, gave evidence that the butter was not unfit for human consumption and the magistrate after examining the butter decided that it was fit for human consumption. No order was therefore made under the Regulations and the butter has been released." In connection with the Town Clerk's report on the 82 casks of butter imported from America in June last and stopped by us under the Unsound Food Regulations as being, to use the legal phraseology of the Regulations, " unsound or unwholesome or unfit for human consumption," I desire to make some general remarks which apply not only to this case in particular but to the question of unsound food in general. It is a good principle, founded on universal experience and upported by medical science, that not only should the food we eat be sound and wholesome, but that the raw materials from which it is manufactured should partake of the same qualities. In the War Office specification for tenders for the supply of food for the troops, this principle is adhered to, and I cannot conceive Public Bodies which cater for inmates under their care, such as Boards of Guardians, adopting any lower standard, and specifying that "cooking butter" must not have more than 3·5 per cent. free fatty acids, expressed as oleic acid, and will not be rejected on account of rancidity, or that "cooking eggs" must not have more than one "spot" or have more than 0.5 per cent. free sulphur expressed as sulphuretted hydrogen. Such a specification would expose them to ridicule and be properly looked upon as a scandal. The fact is that these authorities have taken steps on medical advice to protect those under their care, but the general public have no such safeguards. Owing to trade competition and a public demand for cheap and showy articles of food regardless of their physiological food value, there is, I regret to say, a tendency among some importers and wholesale dealers in food, manufacturers of the cheaper classes of food and public caterers, to adopt a lower standard and use any sort of raw materials provided the final product appears wholesome, and many of them think it quite legitimate to utilise unsound materials provided that their presence can be concealed either by the quantity of the other constituents used, by aromatic substances and essences, or by the process of cooking. If taxed with using such materials they reply that better class ones cost more, that the articles in question are really not dangerous to health, and that the public are benefiting from the reduction in price. As far, however, as my experience goes, the public does not benefit in any sense, and the trader and manufacturer pocket any profit there is. This line of reasoning is not sanctioned either by medical men or good cooks, for the former decline to believe that an unsound article may be partaken of with impunity provided you do not know you are eating it, and the latter know that if you want them to make good and wholesome food you must provide sound materials. Many attempts have already been made to invalidate this principle, notably by using unsound fruit for jam and questionable flesh for sausages, and no doubt many more attempts would be made but for the vigilance of Sanitary Authorities and the occasional exposure of the methods of the food-faker in the Courts. Unfortunately these authorities do not always succeed, especially if they are confronted by a well organised trade backed by ample funds, for the pecuniary interests involved are so great that interested parties do not hesitate to go to considerable expense and trouble in getting expert evidence in their favour. Such evidence generally consists of the gentleman who has "been in the trade all his life," analytical chemists and a very occasional medical man. These gentlemen are very excellent in their way and are, I don't doubt, actuated by the highest motives, among which is the laudable desire to prevent waste, but with the best intentions in the world trade experts and analytical chemists are not in a position to express an opinion on the subject of the effect on the human body of 35 eating particular foods, by reason of their want of training in medical science and physiology. Their work, which is valuable in itself is done when they have informed us, as far as they can, whether the article of food analysed by them consists of its normal constituents, and if abnormal ones are present, their nature and amount. I look upon it as a presumption to apply the coarser methods of the ordinary chemical laboratory to the highly complicated physiological processes of the human body, and to endeavour from them to draw conclusions as to the probable effect of this or that drug or article of food under the varying conditions of health and disease; such an attempt is decidedly an incursion into the field of medical science where they are quite out of place. The facts of the case of this butter are briefly as follow :— It contained, according to the Public Analyst, 3·16 per cent. of free fatty acids against a figure for fresh butter of well under 0·5 per cent., i.e., at least ten times as much as it ought to contain, and this coupled with rancidity rendered it in his opinion unsound and unfit for food. Rancidity is a change which is due to either chemical or bacterial agency or both and is readily detected by taste and smell. In other words it was a good butter which had undergone deterioration and become unsound. It was also admitted by nearly all the witnesses for the defence that the butter could not and was not intended to be sold over the counter, i.e., not fit for use as ordinary butter, but that it was nevertheless good enough for the making of cakes, confectionery, toffee, etc. It was also proved that on making cakes with it the taste and smell could be so disguised that the ordinary customer could not detect its presence and that when extracted from the finished article the percentage of fatty acids had increased and the rancidity was not lost. Now if the consumer eats such butter in the ordinary way, he will experience unpleasant after effects, and until it is definitely proved by proper physiological experiments that it is not only quite harmless but a wholesome article of diet, when used for cooking and confectionery, I decline to accept the statement of traders and analytical chemists that its use for such purposes is free from objection. To the statement that it is a wasteful proceeding to destroy the butter or send it for soap-making my answer is that by a suitable process it could be freed from the objectionable constituents and sold as renovated butter, but such a proposition was never put before me. lam fully alive to the difficulties of proving positive danger to health from using this butter in cakes and confectionery, but even supposing this point was not proved to the satisfaction of the Court I still hold that it is unsound and unwholesome, and having made my protest, am freed from the responsibility of allowing a trade in unsound butter for confectionery purposes to spring up without acquainting the public of the nature of the constituents used in the making of cakes and confectionery by certain firms. As the "firm of very high standing" which negotiated for the purchase of this butter preferred that their name should not be made public, I think it is quite legitimate to draw the conclusion that they were ashamed of their bargain. A vendor or importer of butter can be summoned for having 1 per cent. of water in his butter above the prescribed standard, but it seems as if an importer may have 3 or 4 per cent. free fatty acids with impunity. The question of the use of raw materials which are actually unsound or just on the border line is a very wide one, and I feel very strongly that those gentlemen who support a low standard in the manufacture of food are taking a very grave responsibility and opening the door to many abuses. I have already given two instances of such abuses which have come within my personal experience and others I have met are the "working off" unsound coffee and cocoa berries among good ones or if too unsound in bulk making extracts; making flour from unsound and damaged wheat; and utilising damaged and unsound rice for food; using bad eggs for pastry, and lastly, unsound butter for cakes, toffee, etc. Many more examples might be cited, but those above-mentioned will suffice. In fact some traders and manufacturers seem to think that certain raw products are rarely if ever so bad as to be incapable of being utilised for food and one scientific witness in the above case included butter among these. A view seems further to exist among many people fostered by interested parties and often expressed in Courts of Law that because you cannot prove immediate "danger" to health such as the production of some definite complaint like enteric fever or diphtheria or of some form of acute poisoning by ptomaines and the like, your evidence is valueless and the food in question may be considered not only harmless but beneficial. But have these people never heard of slow poisons which attack not only individuals and communities, but races? Physical deterioration of which we have heard so much lately is caused by several factors, one of which is improper food, and this term includes, in my opinion, not only food unsuitable to the individual but also food of poor quality compounded of unsound materials, and surely it is the duty of everyone interested in the improvement of the race to see that every factor prejudicial to the health is, as far as possible, eliminated. These are the grounds on which I have acted in the present instance, but it is verv up-hill work for the individual Medical Officer of Health unless he is backed up by an enlightened public opinion and my hope in commenting at some length on this case is that it may contribute in a small degree to arouse people to the vital necessity of care in the selection of their food. Unsound Bacon. The following report was made to the Council on January 18th, 1916, and on the same date the Council decided to apply for a summons:— "Seizure of Unsound Bacon. We report that at 4 p.m. on 17th December, 1915, food inspector Mr. Scott visited Messrs. Armour & Co.'s premises at 10, Weston Street, and found a barrel of hams, picnics, etc., which he considered unfit for food. He immediately communicated with the office, and was shortly joined by Mr. Ashdown and the Medical Officer. They examined about 20 barrels and found the contents were all quite unfit for food, and Mr. Scott thereupon seized the whole parcel. The owners agreed that this was a fair sample and that the rest of the parcel was in a similar condition. The whole amount seized comprised 825 barrels, 50 puncheons and 25 tierces of pork. An application for an order for the destruction of the quantity seized was made the following morning before Mr. Symons, the magistrate presiding at the Tower Bridge Police Court, who visited the premises and examined the pork. He made an Order for the destruction of the whole parcel, and this has since been carried out. "Representatives of the company attended before us and explained that the bacon in its then condition would not have been sold for human consumption. We have given instructions for counsel to be briefed. "We recommend—That a summons be applied for against Messrs. Armour & Co., Ltd., of 46A, Holborn Viaduct." On March 7th, 1916, the result of the case was reported as follows to the Council:— "We report that the summons against Armour & Co., Ltd., with respect to the seizure of 825 barrels 50 puncheons and 25 tierces of pork at the company's premises, 10, Weston Street, was heard before Mr. Chapman at the Tower Bridge Police Court on the 23rd February. Mr. Bodkin appeared for the Council, and Mr. Muir for the company. The company pleaded guilty. Messrs. Scott and Ashdown and a Mr. J. Gray gave evidence on behalf of the Council, and Mr. Kelly for the company. The magistrate took the view that the company were to some extent the victims of circumstances arising through the war, but were responsible for the negligence and carelessness of their servants. The company were fined £20 and £10 10s. costs. The pork was destroyed by being sold to a firm of soapmakers for the purpose of their extracting the fat. The price paid to the Council was £584 10s. 6d. for 103 tons, and the cost of cartage, destruction and condemnation was £25 17s. 1d. The cost of the prosecution was £14 11s. 0d., so that the total received by the Council amounts to £614 10s. 6d., the total costs and expenses, £40 8s. 1d., leaving a net balance in the Council's favour of £574 2s. 5d." 100 3156¾ 18 46 169 281 644 14966¼ 1025 480 405 13627 2951 3942¼ 35 2260½ Mr. Ashdown „ Scott 462 686 1683¼ 67 216½ 483½ 35½ 22¼ ... 6 712 536¼ 536 33 3¼ ... 678 578 „ Hoskins 550 160¼ 2808¾ 25 7112 148¼ 13 37 906 752 663 387½ 56442 49¼ ½ „ Wood ... ... ½ ... ... ... 1 1 ... ... 1 1 ... ... ... 2099 4446 1030 1770 22422¾ 926 690 72 131 2313 422¾ 1369 15376 4126 6243¾ 57467 Note. —The inspections refer to the number of separate lots, and the weights are only approximate. Register of places where Food is Prepared for Sale. The following table gives the number and kind of the various places where food is prepared or stored: — Bakehouses 84 Butchers 73 Fishmongers, friers and curers ... ... ... 63 Food stores 562 Food wharves and depots ... ... ... 100 Food factories 23 Fruiterers and greengrocers ... ... ... 91 Icecream ... ... ... ... ... ... 95 Milk-sellers 253 Restaurants and eating houses ... ... ... 120 Coffee stalls 12 1,476 Milk Premises. There were 278 milk premises on the Register at the end of 1914. 30 were added and 55 removed during 1915, making a total of 253 on the Register at the end of the year under report. 768 inspections were made and 20 notices served. Cowsheds. There was one cowshed in the Borough, but the same is now closed. This received 3 visits during the year. Slaughterhouses. There is one slaughterhouse in the Borough. 20 inspections were made. No notices were served. Ice Cream Premises. There were 113 premises where ice cream is manufactured on the Register at the end of 1914. 11 were removed during the year under report, making a total of 102. 110 inspections were made and 11 notices served. Army Work (Food). In continuance of the supervision of military contracts for food carried out in this Borough, and mentioned in last year's Annual Report, the two food inspectors were employed throughout the year systematically inspecting food turned out by all the leading food manufacturers in the Borough. This has been of inestimable advantage to our soldiers, for the standards of purity were fully laid down by the War Office, and any deviation from them is followed by confiscation of the articles in question and the prompt removal of the firm from the contract list. If the civil population were as well protected there would be less outcry about adulteration and inferior qualities of food. The number of contracts supervised in 1915, at the request of the Local Government Board on behalf of the War Office, was 46. We received no special request from the Admiralty to supervise similar naval contracts, but there were a great many undertaken in this Borough by the same firms which were fulfilling military contracts. In this case, also, practically all food stuffs manufactured here intended for the navy were supervised by us. Outside these contracts for the manufacture of food several firms in the Borough packed enormous quantities of dried fruits, etc., for the forces, and supervision was indirectly exercised over this packing by the whole of the three food inspectors. This will give some idea of the necessity and the value of having so many special food inspectors. As a matter of fact we could do with a wharves inspector to assist Mr. Ashdown, but I am afraid that in the present crisis it would be impossible to get such an inspector even should the Council decide upon increasing the staff.

Ashdown. Unsound, Food and Foreign Meat Regulations. "Reviewing the operations, under the regulations in this district during the year ended December 31st last, it appears that a comparison with previous years would be useless either as an indication of trade progress or as to the percentage of waste in the various articles landed. The war conditions and other circumstances also render brevity a necessity. "No new legislation or orders have come into operation. With one exception, namely, eggs, we have adhered to the same methods of inspection and disposal of waste as in recent years. "In the case of eggs the quantity was far below the average, but lengthened time in transit caused abnormal waste in the shipments landed in the district and also a great amount of anxiety and trouble. Numerous methods were attempted for the disposal of these unsavoury goods in a satisfactory manner, but the result of proceedings taken against the Council indicate that the Courts were of opinion that the Council had failed in its duty. "A further case of considerable interest, namely, butter, is fully reported upon by the Medical Officer of Health. I' simply direct attention to my remarks made in previous reviews with regard to coffee, and suggest that they apply equally to butter, and show that to the trader's mind butter is like coffee, and none is bad for food, the one and only consideration being market value. Customs Authorities. "The most amicable feeling exists with these officers, and the ever ready and valuable assistance rendered by them is deserving of the warmest thanks. Destruction of Unsound Food. "In my remarks for last year's report I commented upon the difficulty and cost of destroying unsound foodstuffs, the Destructor being, in reality, more used as a Power Generating Station than a Destructor. "At that time removal by barge had been discontinued, but the remarks relative to the Destructor still obtain. At the time of writing barging has been renewed, but I venture to direct attention to the enormous annual cost incurred by the Council in destroying what in most cases is really a useful material. This has now been remedied in the eggs and tinned meat products since these are emptied and the contents of the tins sold for the extraction of fat." FOOD AND DRUGS. In Tables XIII. and XIV. of Appendix will be found a list of the samples taken in 1915, and the action taken; 1,198 samples were taken, compared with 1,186 in 1914 and 1,193 in 1913. Of these 7·4 per cent. were found adulterated, compared with 11·6 per cent. in the previous year and 14·7 per cent. in 1913. It would be noted in the above paragraph that the adulteration was considerably less than in the previous two years. The following paragraph is taken from the Annual Report for 1914: — "The most notable feature of the analysis of samples of this and recent years is the number of adulterations of milk which show the addition of small percentages of water, ranging from 1·5 to 4·0 per cent. This is due to the present standard which requires 3 per cent. of fat and 8·5 per cent. of non-fatty solids. Magistrates and others are liable to forget that this so-called 'standard' represents the lowest limit below which milk must not go. The vast majority of natural milks show considerably higher figures, and the result is that the samples are watered down so as to be as near as possible this 'standard' and the small percentages show that they occasionally overstep the mark." I regret to say that there is no improvement in the adulterations for small amounts. While a few magistrates take a serious view of these and inflict substantial fines, the large majority of magistrates seem to inflict their fines in proportion to the smallness of the adulterations, the result is that it pays very well to water the milk down to the "standard" and risk overstepping of the mark. It is a curious thing, that if a man waters his beer or whisky by small amounts below the standard laid down by the Inland Revenue, a very large and substantial fine is immediately inflicted, the result being that the offence is not repeated. A few really substantial fines would very soon put a stop to all these adulterations. Sixteen per cent. is the amount of water allowed in butter, and it is astonishing how closely manufacturers keep to this amount, but occasionally they also overstep the mark, but even this small percentage beyond the legal limit is very beneficial to the trader if undetected, since he can make a very large profit out of 1 per cent. In Table Q will be seen the percentages of milk fat in the various samples of milk for ten years. In Table R the work of the Food Inspectors is fully set forth. TABLE Q. Total Samples. Milk Fat.

Inspections. In Table XII. of Appendix will be found particulars of the general sanitary work by the District Inspectors during 1915, and in Table IX. the number of premises on the Registers to which special attention has been paid. The house-to-house inspections number 4,374. This is 962 below the total for the previous year, and is an average of 547 per Inspector, against 667 in 1914. 4,356 intimation notices were served, compared with 4,949 and 1,111 statutories, against 1,302 in the previous year. Work in connection with the Military Authorities. In pursuance of the arrangements mentioned in my last Annual Report on the Military duties of Sanitary authorities, the inspectors paid weekly visits to the places where soldiers were billeted in the Borough. These billets were of two kinds—at private houses and at certain important points on the lines of communication where there were more or less permanent garrisons. At various times during the year soldiers were billeted in 191 private houses and to these 1,170 weekly visits were paid by the district inspectors. The number of men in the other billets on various points of the railway averaged about 500 and the total number of visits paid to these were 1,642. The number of letters written to and from the military authorities were 98, and in 24 of these improvements in the billets were effected owing to representations made to Commanding Officers. All cases of infectious disease occurring in connection with the soldiers who were in billets or on leave were immediately communicated to the Commanding Officer of the unit concerned and the soldiers were not allowed to return to camp until they had a certificate of disinfection from this Department. In this connection the number of rooms disinfected were 315 and the bedding and bed-clothing disinfected comprised 1,226 articles. 84 articles of clothing were also disinfected for vermin and infectious diseases. The close connection between the health of the civil and the military population was not fully appreciated in 1914, but with the increase in the number of soldiers both on the continent and in training this became of paramount importance. This has been most noticeable in the recruiting of medical men for the R.A.M.C., which work was handed over by the War Office to the British Medical Association. The latter body on the whole has done the work efficiently, and while anxious to get doctors for the military requirements have not neglected the wants of the civil population. Smoke Nuisances. 88 observations were kept on chimneys and 29 notices served. House Refuse. The following table shows the amount of house and trade refuse disposed of during the year ended December, 1915:- House Refuse— Tons. Cwts. Qrs.

The offensive trades on the Register are as follows:- Tripe boiler 1 Glue and size makers 4 Fellmongers 3 Fat melters 4 Manure manufacturer 1 D2 51 Summer Diarrhaa and Flies. Nothing special was done in the continuance of this campaign, owing partly to shortage of staff, and inspectors being engaged on military work, but some handbills were distributed. On the whole, there was much less prevalence of flies in the Borough owing to the comparatively cold, damp summer. DISINFECTION. The following table shows the number of articles passed through the steam disinfector during the year under report:— Beds 720 Sheets 1,033 Blankets 1,059 Books 347 Bolsters 499 Miscellaneous 4,138 Carpets 2 Verminous Clothing 11,495 Cushions 223 Hair (bundles) 27,851 Mattresses 283 „ (cases) 145 Overlays 247 Total 50,145 Pillows 1,389 Quilts 674 14,379 new tabs were used to replace those taken off mattresses, palliases, and cushions before disinfection. Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. During the year under report 23 male adults, 666 male and 1,263 female children used the Verminous Baths and had their clothing disinfected. The total number of articles disinfected for this purpose was 11,495. Table S shows the work done by the District Inspectors during the year:— 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 House to House.

During the year 1915, it became increasingly evident that the work of the Health Visitors, partly owing to war conditions, became more important, and towards the end of the year the Council were urged to appoint additional Health Visitors making four in all. The question was considered at various Committee meetings. At the latter part of the year and the beginning of 1916, impetus was given to the movement by the generosity of an anonymous donor, who promised to pay the salary of an additional Health Visitor for two years, provided the Council did the same. The Committee, however, felt that in the present uncertainty of the money market produced by the war, coupled with the warning of the Local Government Board to all Sanitary Authorities to be strictly economical, decided to postpone the matter for six months. This letter from the Board was rather unfortunate since the Board had just been urging the advisabilty of paying great attention to infantile mortality and had written us strongly urging the appointment of additional Health Visitors. The Committee was saddled also at the same time with a fresh and unknown expense in the notification of Measles Order, which, no doubt, contributed to the Committee's decision. I trust that, in the near future, the Committee will re-consider this decision for I am of opinion that we are badly under-staffed. The present Health Visitors feel that they cannot overtake the work, and from their point of view it is most unsatisfactory and unpleasant to constantly feel that one's work is only partially done and that one is unable even to see the good result of one's work. The following table summarises the work done by the Health Visitors. I am afraid, however, that there is a tendency among Sanitary Authorities to lay too much stress on numbers, both as regards Health Visitors and Sanitary Inspectors. Numbers are very useful, but if great stress is laid on numbers, it is quite easy for those to be increased by spending a little less time on individual visits and by rushing about. The result is, especially with regard to Health Visitors, that the work is much less efficiently done and the effect is far from lasting. When the Health Visitor visits a mother she must endeavour to make this visit more in the light of a friendly than of an official one. To compass this, they must be prepared to enter into general conversation with the mother and make sympathetic enquiries into the condition of the home, and the difficulties the parents have to contend with, etc., and find out where the mother really needs help. All this takes time and if the effect is to last this first visit should be followed up by others. The same remarks apply to Sanitary inspectors though in a somewhat less degree since the Sanitary inspector is not so immediately concerned with the family. If an official Health Visitor does her work conscientiously the Committee has no occasion to rely solely on large numbers. On the other hand if an official is not conscientious and desires to make a good show, it is very easy to do this though doing no real solid work. The total number of births which took place in Bermondsey last year was 3,482 and of these 3,293 were notified under the Notification of Births Act, 1907. The difficulty in getting the whole of the cases notified still continues, even in spite of the special letters, mentioned in the last report, sent out to doctors and parents. The latter are constantly confusing the Notification of Births with the Registration. I get dozens of letters every year in reply to those special letters stating that they have registered the child and consider that they have done their duty, when this is accomplished. I cannot comprehend why the time for registration is not shortened to, say, seven days, in which case the Notification Act itself would be much more complete. Ido not see any prospect of ever getting a complete list of births from the Notification of Births Act, and the only fault with the registration is that they are given far too long an interval, namely six weeks, before it is necessary to register. This enables people to change their residence and escape vaccination. Of the 3,293 births notified, 2,391 received primary visits, and 512 secondary visits. The whole of the former were breast fed, and as this is the rule in Bermondsey, I may repeat here the remarks on this subject from my last report. This, however, only continues for a period of a month, or six weeks at furthest, after which period working mothers here find it necessary to supplement the meagre income by work of some description. Their infants ate then left in charge of a stranger or some inexperienced member of the family, the result being they are artificially fed, and the wonder is that the infantile mortality is not much greater. It speaks well for the vitality of the infantile population that they survive the extraordinary methods of feeding to which some of them are subjected. Any enquiries into the subject of breast feeding and the best methods of ensuring its continuance will be incomplete if the economic conditions of the mothers is not taken into account. Baby Classes. There are two classes held, one in the suite of rooms used as a tenement in the Neckinger Shelter, and the other at 163, Abbeyfield Road, by kind permission of Sister Miriam, of the Lady Gomm Dispensary. The suite of rooms at the shelter consist of a kitchen and two bedrooms and bath and lavatory accommodation. The kitchen is used as a waiting room, the large bedroom as an undressing and weighing room, and the small bedroom for medical consultations. The clientèle for this class comes mainly from the western district in charge of Miss Nuttall, and she has shown great interest in the keeping up of the attendance with very satisfactory results. She was ably assisted on class day by Mrs. Croke, from whose district a few babies came. The average attendance here was 26. The class in 163, Abbeyfield Road was under the special care of Mrs. Croke. As the space was limited, we had to limit the attendance, the average attendance here being 8 per week. The medical work of these consultations was done by myself, and the year's work impressed me more than ever of the value of these consultations. The mothers take a great interest in them, and appreciate the advice very highly. No attempt was made to treat serious disease since as soon as any is discovered the patient is referred to the private practitioner or Guy's Hospital. Our work aims at prevention rather than cure. We endeavour to impress upon the mothers the importance of breast feeding, and give her advice on the technique of this. There is a prevalent idea that mothers do not require teaching on this subject, and while this may be true of people living in a state of nature, it is not correct about modern mothers, since they are brought up in highly artificial conditions, and need instruction in the art of breast feeding just as much as artificial feeding both in infancy and later life. In addition to the two Municipal Baby Classes mentioned above, there are four similar classes, conducted by voluntary agencies in other parts of the Borough. There is the Rotherhithe and Bermondsey Babies' Institute, which has three branches— one at Princes Street, Rotherhithe, one at West Lane, and one at the Central Hall. There is also another one run in connection with the Princess Club, Jamaica Road, which was moved temporarily to 39, St. James Road. These centres are very well attended by mothers anxious for advice, and a lady doctor attends at each of them on certain days to give advice on feeding and minor complaints, very much on the lines of our own. Maternity and Child Welfare. The question of Maternity and Child Welfare was first considered by the Council in a report on the matter to the Public Health Committee on 24th November, 1914. This was adjourned and re-considered at the meeting on January 26, 1915, when a general scheme was suggested with an estimate. This much was reported in the Annual Report for 1914. The matter was adjourned to February 9th, and it was again adjourned to March 9th. At this date it was adjourned again, and was not taken up till I made the following report to the Committee on the 30th November, with a recommendation of additional Health Visitors to be appointed. "In March of the present year a report was made by me on the above subject, but owing to financial reasons the Council decided to take no action. I have, however, received a most generous offer from a gentleman who has studied the social conditions in Bermondsey, and who desires at present to remain anonymous, which I trust will induce the Council to reconsider their decision. The proposal is, briefly, that if the Council will appoint two additional health visitors he will be responsible for the salary of one of them for the first two years. "The Committee will remember that the report dealt with two schemes, viz.: one proposed by the Board of Education and the other by the Local Government Board. "The proposal of the former was that instruction should be given by lectures and systematic class teaching, and that treatment, if given at all, should be only incidental. They also left out of account ante-natal and natal work. The Local Government Board, on the other hand, suggested a much more complete scheme, which includes ante-natal, natal and post-natal work, lays much more stress on individual than class instruction, and provides for treatment. They promised that approximately half the expenditure incurred by the Sanitary Authority would be met by the Imperial Exchequer. "In the scheme proposed by me in that report an extension of our present work was recommended, the most important item being that which concerned the appointment of two more health visitors. "Experience gained since then has confirmed me in the view that individual instruction, such as one gives to mothers in a babies' class and during home visits, is much more valuable than systematic lectures or courses of any kind. "Last year there were 3,727 births notified in Bermondsey, and of these 2,777 received primary visits, the number of secondary visits being only 322. In many ways I look upon secondary visits as the more important ones since the first visit being official is mainly used for making enquiries, which do not always tend to produce a frame of mind on the part of the mother favourable for receiving instruction, besides the health visitor can hardly find her real needs during one visit, and it is only when she gains the mother's confidence that her advice bears fruit. "I am aware that Sanitary Authorities have been warned against extravagance, but expenses incurred in the preservation of child life specially during the present war not only cannot be included under this head, but are from a national point of view a sound financial investment. On the other hand, Sanitary Authorities may rather lay themselves open to a charge of extravagance by neglecting any reasonable measure to preserve the lives of prospective mothers and their offspring. "I recommend, therefore, that steps be taken with a view to appointing two additional health visitors with the usual qualifications." This was followed, on December 14th, by a further report at the request of the Committee, viz.: — "As some members of the Committee expressed a desire for more information as to why we want health visitors or what exactly are their duties, I shall endeavour, with the aid of a few figures, to furnish a short answer to these perfectly natural questions. "Why do we want health visitors? Because the parents, especially of lower middle and working classes, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of many of the elementary rules of hygiene, especially in matters concerning maternity and the management and care of infants and young children. This is owing to the steady migration from country to town during the last fifty years, with the result that the women have largely abandoned their household duties during early womanhood and taken to work in factories which are the worst possible training schools for motherhood. Town life has also had the effect of causing physical deterioration, so that many of the mothers of the present generation are not so capable of producing healthy offsprings as were their mothers of an older generation. "As a discussion of the underlying causes for this state of affairs would lead one very far afield, I will rest content with the above statement of the facts and show what are the consequences. As a nation our main object in this connection is to maintain a healthy increase of our population so that we may not be swamped by alien races who are propagating themselves faster than we are, and as in monetary affairs this can only be done in two ways, by increasing our income or birth rate and decreasing our expenditure or loss of population by premature death. Unfortunately, as regards the first there is a general tendency for the birth rate in all civilized countries to decrease steadily, and while an endeavour should be made to check this, we, as a sanitary authority, are more concerned with decreasing the waste of human life. Up to the present we have succeeded very well in preserving the lives over one year of age, but, unfortunately, the death rate of the first year of life shows little evidence of the permanent fall which has occurred in the later age periods. There are three periods in which a large wastage is taking place which I will call (1) The ante-natal period, (2) the natal period, and (3) the post-natal period. In the ante-natal period, which comprises the 40 weeks before birth, it is estimated that 150 infants die out of every 1,000, which includes 120 foetal deaths, i.e., deaths during the first 27 weeks of pregnancy when the child, if born, is incapable of a separate existence, and 30 stillbirths, i.e., infants dying in the last 12 weeks of pregnancy when, had they been born alive, they would have had a chance of surviving to adult life. In Bermondsey, with its total of 3,800 births, this means an annual loss of about 570 potential lives. The post-natal period for our purposes will comprise the infant life up to the end of the first 12 months. Deaths occurring during the last period are generally spoken of as ' Infantile Mortality,' and are calculated as so many occurring to every 1,000 births. Thus, the infantile mortality of 1914, in London, was 104, and in Bermondsey 129, a total annual loss for this Borough of 487 infants in the first year of life. If now we add to this figure the estimated ante-natal and natal loss of 570 we get a total annual wastage of potential and actual infant life of over 1,000. This figure might well be considerably increased if the loss of life through the fall of the birth rate, which I have omitted, were taken into account. The causes of this wastage are general classed as maternal and foetal. Maternal causes may be constitutional, such as venereal disease, kidney disease, diabetes and acute fevers, or they may be local, such as uterine tumour or disease, pelvic deformities and the like. Other causes may be termed E 65 violent, such as accidents and drug taking. On the other hand, death of the infant during or shortly after uterine life may be due to causes in the foetus as distinct from the mother, such as inherited weakness or disease of unknown cause. "The next question is, can this wastage of life be prevented or reduced? Reduced it certainly can be, but there will always be a certain amount beyond the reach of medical skill. As the question is a very large one I can only indicate the lines on which it has been recommended, that sanitary authorities might do much good. As we have seen that the greatest amount of wastage is ante-natal and natal, the remedy which immediately suggests itself is to endeavour to get all mothers under some sort of medical supervision during this period; but this can only be done by teaching women the great importance of proper advice during pregnancy. The medical officer of the Local Government Board does not think anything is to be gained by compulsory notification of pregnancy, and most people will agree with him, but the prospective mother should know where she can go to for sound advice, and it is here, in my opinion, that judicious and tactful advice from health visitors will accomplish much good. If the district which a health visitor supervises is not too large she soon gets to know the prospective mothers, for if she is known to be tactful and sympathetic she will never have to force her advice on the young married woman, but it will be eagerly sought by them, and they will make her a confident of their various troubles and difficulties. If the case seems to demand it the health visitor would advise her to consult her medical attendant or, failing this, to seek advice at a maternity centre or ante-natal clinic. Such a centre may be established by the sanitary authority in districts where special hospitals do not exist, or if in a city like London, similar use should be made of the many excellently equipped general or special hospitals for women. In this way only will it be possible to deal with this problem in its first stage. If this succeeds the rest follows easily, for once the women of the district have gained confidence in her advice they will engage proper help during labour, and when the child is born will naturally turn to the same source when the many difficulties connected with rearing which beset the young mother begin. At present she is dependent for advice on the 'Gamp' who attends her at her confinement or on some relative who bases her claim to knowledge of infants on having had a large family, often with a high infantile mortality. So far I have only mentioned what is the most important work of health visitors, but there are many other duties which fall to their lot. Up to the age of three to four, when children come under the school authorities, it should be the aim of the health visitor to keep in touch with the families of her district, and give advice when sought, especially in the many infectious diseases to which young children are liable, to encourage the mother to seek advice as to feeding and clothing at the municipal babies' classes or one of the many voluntary agencies doing similar work in our midst, and now that most of the infectious diseases to which children are liable, including the very fatal disease of measles, are compulsorily notifiable she will have her field of utility much extended. A small portion of her time as heretofore may also be very usefully given to visitation of cases of consumption among the adult population. "To sum up then: (1) There is a waste of actual and potential human lives up to the end of the first year of life, calculated for Bermondsey as over 1,000 per annum, which by appropriate means can be largely prevented, and the first step towards this end is to appoint a sufficient number of health visitors to instruct mothers and prospective mothers; and (2) the duties of these ladies should consist in visiting women before and immediately after a birth, and giving such instruction and advice as will help to secure healthy children coming into the world and keeping them when they are here. "The question of their visiting cases of measles, as suggested by the Local Government Board, is one that requires consideration, and I have some doubts as to the wisdom, except in an emergency, of their visiting houses where there is infectious disease while undertaking the duties mentioned above. They will also, in co-operation with the tuberculosis dispensary, keep the consumptive adults under supervision, so as to limit the disease in advanced cases and advise such steps as will conduce to the recovery of the early ones. Such work as here sketched, conscientiously carried out, will soon bear fruit in a saving of life and raising the standard of health. E2 67 On January 11th, 1916, the following further report on the work of the health visitors was given at the request of the Committee:— "The present duties of the health visitors consist in (1) Paying visits to houses where births have recently occurred. (2) Visiting any cases of the following infectious diseases: phthisis, ophthalmia neonatorum, puerperal fever, polio-myelitis and diarrhoea. (3) Various other special visits are paid by request, or where it is thought the investigations may be more suitably carried out by a health visitor than a sanitary inspector. "The number of births in 1914 was 3,727, and of these 2,777 received primary visits, but the number of secondary visits was only 322. It is calculated that one health visitor cannot on the average make more than 500 primary visits in a year if the babies receiving these visits are to continue under adequate supervision up to school age. From the above figures it will be seen that each of our health visitors paid 1,388 primary visits and 161 secondary visits, and it is, therefore, evident that the large majority of the babies were not kept under supervision at all, as the other work prevented anything but the very worst cases being attended to subsequent to the first visit. With four health visitors all the recent births in the Borough could receive one visit, which means about 900 primary visits to each health visitor. This would not come up to the standard above suggested, but it would, nevertheless, be a vast improvement on the present system, and I think that the children requiring it could receive some supervision up to school age. "The question at present is not one of overworking the health visitors, since it is physically impossible to pay more than a certain number of visits in the day, and their time is at present quite fully occupied. Conscientious visitors may, however, be worried because they feel that their efforts to overtake the work are useless, and such a state of affairs eventually results in inefficient work. "Excluding the visits to births, the total number of other visits paid in 1914 was 1,355, the large majority of them being to phthisical patients. In the suggested addition to the staff a certain number of ante-natal visits will have to be included. I would warn the Committee, however, not to be led away by figures, because if you compute pute the good done solely by the numbers visited, you may be getting an entirely false idea of the results of the work. The piling up of visits for the sake of increasing the figures is an easy matter, but health visiting cannot be compared to the visits of the postman or even the sanitary inspector, because it is absolutely essential, if their visits are to be of effect, that they get on friendly terms with the mother and family, and this cannot be done by a purely formal visit such as that of the sanitary inspector." This last report was adjourned for consideration at the meeting of the Committee on January 26th, 1916, when it was finally decided that the whole subject was to be reconsidered in six months' time. There the matter stands at present, and at the time of writing it has not been before the Committee again. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. During the year under report I assisted personally at the Dispensary at the Monday night consultations. The experience was very valuable, inasmuch as it gave me a clearer insight into the problems which concern the practical administration of Tuberculosis Dispensaries. Though the co-operation as usual between the dispensary and ourselves was not sanctioned by formal agreement, it was, nevertheless, very close. An agreement was drawn up between ourselves and the dispensary authorities on the one hand and the County Council on the other hand, but owing to various delays, they were not finally settled till this year. From the Dispensary Annual Report it seems that during the year there were 539 new patients examined; of these 327 were definitely suffering from or suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis in some form. The number of visits paid by patients to the dispensary was 8,973, and the nunber of visits paid to the homes of patients was 622 by the Medical Officer and 2,289 by the nurses. Hairdressers and Barbers. At the end of 1915 eleven barbers were in possession of certificates. IV.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. In Table X. of the Appendix will be found particulars of the inspections of factories and workshops, and in the following table particulars regarding the trades and persons employed in connection with workshops. There were 328 workshops on the Register in 1915. Including bakehouses, of which there were 70 in use, the total is 398. Owing to war conditions and the placing of large contracts with firms in this Borough, there has been an enormous increase in female labour. This has had great influence on social conditions of the working classes, and if they can be instructed how to spend the extra money now earned wisely, the general result ought to be beneficial. I hope to refer to this subject at greater length in my next Annual Report. OUTWORKERS. There were 549 outworkers on the Register at the end of 1915. 83 lists were sent in by firms in this Borough employing outworkers. Table X. of the Appendix shows the various trades followed by outworkers in this district. APPENDIX. • APPENDIX. Table I.—Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1915 and Previous Years.
