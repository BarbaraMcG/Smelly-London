To The Chairman and Members of the Woolwich Local Board of Health. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report upon the sanitary condition of Woolwich during the year 1894. Mortality Statistics. There have been 769 deaths during the year, of this number 326 occured in the Dockyard Registration SubDistrict and 443 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The gross death rate for the year estimated upon a population of 41,417 is 18.5 per thousand. Of these deaths 190 took place in various medical institutions (Table 7) outside the district, in the appended statistical tables they have however been alloted to their proper registration sub-districts, and calculated as if taking place within the sanitary area of Woolwich. Fourteen deaths occuring within the district were of persons not rightly belonging to Woolwich, if these be deducted from the total deaths, the correct number of deaths occurring in Woolwich during the twelve months ending the 31st December, 1894, will be obtained, viz., 755. Death Rate. The corrected death rate is therefore 18.2 per thousand. The following table shows the corrected death rate yearly, since the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health for the district, on the 29th October, 1889. 1890 20.5 1891 21.6 1892 19.5 1893 19.5 1894 18.2 5 The death rate for the year, which I believe is the lowest on record for the district, bears striking testimony to the success of the efforts which have been made during the past few years to better the conditions under which the inhabitants live, and although it is true the mortality rate for the whole of London during the past year is low, yet it is satisfactory to specially draw attention to this fact. I do not wish to attach undue weight to this fact of a low mortality rate for the year, but I think it may be taken as an indication of an improved condition of things. I have appended tables Nos. 9 and 10, which show comparatively the position taken by Woolwich in this respect to other large towns, and to the various Metropolitan Sanitary Districts. Of these total deaths 290 were of children under 5 years of age, and 465 of persons above that age, of the 290 children, 177 were of infants under one year of age. Here again an improvement is to be noted over the preceding years as illustrated by the following table, the deaths of infants under one year being less than in preceding years. Total Deaths. Deaths under one year. Deaths between the ages of one & five years. 1890 838 215 141 1891 885 222 117 1892 806 198 95 1893 828 210 105 1894 755 177 113 In table 5 will be found a comparison of the deaths occuring in the sanitary district of Woolwich during the years 1892, 1893, and 1894, distinguishing those under 5 years of age and those over 5 years of age. Zymotic Death Rate. The deaths from all causes during the year included 39 from Measles, 22 from Scarlet Fever, 19 from Diarrhoea, 14 from Diptheria, 8 from Whooping Cough, 5 from Typhoid Fever, 4 from Influenza, 2 from Small Pox, and 1 from Croup, in all 114 deaths from diseases classified by the Register General as Specific Febrile or Zymotic. This is equivalent to a Zymotic death rate of 2.6 per thousand. 6 The deaths from Measles, Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria are in excess of those from the same causes last year, when they were respectively 14, 15 and 6. The Zymotic death rate for the past five years is as follows: 1890 2.8 1891 2.8 1892 2.4 1893 2.6 1894 2.6 Phthisis Mortality, etc. In class IV. 126 deaths are recorded as arising from some form of tubercular disease, of which number 54 occurred in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 72 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The great difference between these numbers is occasioned by the deaths from Tabes Mesenterica, Tubercular Meningitis and Hydrocephalus, amounting to 10 in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District and 25 in the Arsenal. 28 of such deaths were of children under 5 years of age and 5 of the remaining 7 were between the ages of 5 and 15. The deaths registered during the past five years as arising from Tubercular causes were as follows : 1890 126 1891 139 1892 112 1893 121 1894 126 I have in previous reports drawn marked attention to the mortality from Tubercular causes in the district, and indicated its grave importance. There is no doubt that in most, if not all of the older houses of the district, there is no provision to prevent dampness, and especially is this the case with the houses in North Woolwich. The Sanitary Authority must insist upon all proper means being adopted to remedy this very great evil, fraught as it is with the most serious injury to health. In class 6, including the deaths from Laryngitis there will be found to be 133 deaths, 55 of these occurred in the Dockyard Registration SubDistrict and 78 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. 7 In 1892 there were 188 such deaths and in 1893, 168 deaths. Sex Mortality. Of the total deaths in the Arsenal Registration SubDistrict there were 230 males and 213 females, in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District 168 males and 158 females, or in other words, of the 769 total deaths in the whole district 398 were of males and 371 of females. 151 deaths were of persons over 60 years of age. Births & Birth Rate. The number of births registered during the year were 1265. Of these 12 were recorded as illegitimate. The birth rate is therefore 30.5 For the past five years the birth rate has been as follows : 1890 30.6 1891 32.7 1892 29.8 1893 31.3 1894 30.5 Marriages. There have been 585 marriages registered during the year, 120 in the first quarter, 136 in the second, 151 in the third and 178 in the fourth. Inquests & Suicides. There have been 77 Inquests during the year. There have been 9 Suicides as follows:—Cut throat 2, Hanging 2, Poison 2, Shooting 1, and Drowning 1. Mortuary. 64 bodies were received into the Mortuary, of which 48 were of persons resident in the district and 16 non-resident. Infectious Diseases. During the year 327 cases of Infectious disease have been notified as follows:- Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 142 73 215 Diphtheria 25 24 49 Erysipelas 18 12 30 Typhoid 11 3 14 Small Pox 9 6 15 Puerperal Fever 3 3 Typhus 1 1 Total 209 118 327 8 Of these 327 cases, 212 were removed to Hospital, as follows:- Arsenal Sub-District Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 106 57 163 Diphtheria 13 11 24 Typhoid Fever 9 0 9 Small Pox 9 6 15 Typhus Fever 1 1 Total 138 74 212 In other words, the following cases were treated at home in their respective districts:— Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 36 16 52 Diphtheria 12 13 25 Erysipelas 18 12 30 Typhoid Fever 2 3 5 Puerperal Fever 3 3 Total 71 44 115 I note with satisfaction the greatly increased number of infectious cases which proceed to Hospital, but I still think the number treated at home is in excess of what might reasonably be expected. The privileges offered to the inhabitants, of free admission to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board is a great boon, and one which it is somewhat surprising is not availed of to its fullest extent. There have however, during the past year been difficulties in the admission of cases owing to the accommodation at the disposal of the Asylums Board being limited, but I hope when the Brook Hospital at Shooter's Hill is opened we shall no longer experience this drawback. The total amount of Infectious Disease present in Woolwich during the year has been much less than in 1893 when 426 notifications were 9 received, the following table will show the prevalence of the principal zymotic diseases during the past five years. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 Scarlet Fever 100 80 338 259 215 Diphtheria 10 8 17 24 49 Typhoid Fever 16 11 18 25 14 Small Pox 2 6l 15 This table is interesting as showing the great increase in the incidence of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria of recent years, the cause or causes of this it is most difficult to determine, indeed on reference to the returns of the Metropolitan Asylums Board we find this increase is progressive in London so far as Diphtheria is concerned, Scarlet Fever, Typhoid Fever and Small Pox showing a diminution in 1894; the notifications received by that Board for the corresponding five years were as follows:— 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 Scarlet Fever 15330 11398 27095 36901 10655 Diphtheria 5870 5907 7781 13026 18440 Typhoid Fever 2877 3372 2465 3663 3360 Small Pox 60 114 423 2813 1192 The increased incidence of Diptheria in London is a question of gravest moment, for many years this disease was looked upon as one peculiar to rural localities, but of recent years it has made serious and fatal inroads upon urban districts, and for some hitherto unexplained reason it appears to have become more prevalent in the South and South Eastern part of England, while its incidence has been less in the Northern and Western part; the increased incidence of this disease in London has imposed upon the Asylums Board the necessity of providing proper Hospital Accommodation for its treatment, which implies wards containing a less number of beds with greater cubic capacity and more expensive administration. We know now more of the cause of Diphtheria than we did, we know that it is associated with the growth of an organism which in the throat finds exactly those conditions most favourable to its development viz., heat, moisture, and a free current of air, and we know further that in its growth it gives rise to a certain chemical product which on its absorption 10 into the system causes those after symptoms with which we are familiar, such as paralysis and the like. From the satisfactory statistical evidence forthcoming it is sincerely to be hoped that in the antitoxic serum treatment a remedy has been found for this serious disease, and it is satisfactory to note that the Metropolitan Asylums Boards have taken every step necessary to ensure that right conclusions may be arrived at on this important subject. One thing, however, still remains to be done, and that is to give the Medical Practitioners of a district facilities for knowing by Bacteriological examination whether or not they are dealing with cases of Diphtheria; doubtless many cases of sore throat of a Diptheritic nature escape notice for some time, during which the patient may be infecting other persons. The Local Government Board have recently made arrangements by which Medical Officers of Health may obtain information of this nature in the earlier cases of any given outbreak, but it is not the Medical Officers of Health who want the facilities but the ordinary Medical Attendants in a district. It is to be hoped the Metropolitan Asylums Boards will seek legislative powers to carry out this useful work, for although from a certain standpoint it is desirable to examine such cases before admission to the Metropolitan Fever Hospitals, it is of greater importance from the point of view of the prevention of disease to give facilities for such examination in the case of ordinary sore throat with the view of isolating the case, if diptheritic, at the earliest stage and thus by prevepting attendance at school, and in other ways, seek to diminish the prevalence of this formidable complaint. Small Pox was notified 15 times, by the prompt removal of the cases to Hospital and by the adoption of all proper measures the disease did not spread. The cases were notified as follows:— Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard. Sub-District. January 1 February 2 1 March 1 April 2 May 4 July 1 September 3 9 6 11 The notification of Infectious Diseases still continues to work well and without the slightest friction with the Medical Practitioners of the district. Disinfection. During the year 6525 articles of clothing, bedding, etc., have been disinfected (Table XVI.) Sickness returns. I append a table giving the sickness returns from various . sources for the year. (Table XVIII.) Common. Lodging houses There are 38 common lodging houses in the district. The control of these houses during the past year has been transferred from the Commissioner of Police to the London County Council, they are generally well conducted, and the proprietors continue to evince a desire to co-operate in every way with the Sanitary Officials. On the evening of Thursday, the 31st January, 1895, the following were the number of persons sleeping in these houses. Single men 475 Single women 39 Couples 79 Children 18 A total of 690 persons. The following was the per centage of the available beds occupied in the district on this night : Single men beds 74.32 per cent. Single women beds 81.25 „ „ Married couple beds 95.4 „ „ Slaughter houses. There are 7 slaughter houses licensed in the district and the licencees generally observe all the regulations in force by the London County Council. I regret that during the year your Board came to a decision contrary to the opinion expressed by other Sanitary Authorities as to the desirability of establishing a public abattoir. In the interests of the trade as well as of the inhabitants generally I consider such an establishment is most desirable, for in the one case an undesirable adjunct to the business premises is 12 removed whilst in the other the opportunity for the regular and systematic inspection of the meat supply of the district is provided. Bakehouses. These have during the year been systematically visited and compliance with the regulations enforced. There are 42 bakehouses in the district, structurally many of them are most defective, but legally the greatest difficulties exist for abolishing them. Rag & Bone Shops. These have been regularly visited and have called for no special action on the part of the officials. Cow Sheds, Milk shops &c. There are three licensed cow sheds in the district, these together with the milk shops, &c., have been subjected to constant supervision. The Market. The market has been systematically visited both by night and day, occasionally only has it been found necessay to seize food as unfit for human consumption, the meat is frequently, however, of poor quality. Dust collection The pail system continues to work most satisfactorily. The dust is removed weekly from every house in the district, and from some of the streets in the poorer parts of the town twice or thrice weekly. The destructor provided by the Board works very satisfactorily both by night and day. I append in Table XXV. an interesting financial statement prepared by Mr. H. O. Thomas, the Surveyor to the Board, relative to its use. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The number of houses dealt with under this Act has necessarily not been so large as in previous years. Certificates were however given in reference to 6 houses and these were subsequently demolished. The question of the provision of better houses for the working classes is one which must soon seriously occupy the attention of your Board 13 even if the time has not now arrived. Many improvements which have of late years been made in Woolwich such as the erection of Board Schools in Mulgrave Place, the erection of the Baths in Market Street, etc., have resulted in the demolition of a large number of houses, but as will be seen by reference to the following figures there is no total diminution in the number of houses in the district. for other houses have been built. Number of Houses Built 207 See Table XXVI. Number Demolished 83 In Woolwich there are however a large number of old and delapidated houses, destitute of such sanitary conveniences as are in the present dayexpected in houses for the poorer classes, which by being patched up, oftimes in a prefunctory manner, are enabled to escape out of my hands, but which remain eminently unsatisfactory and a constant source of trouble and anxiety, of this class examples may be found in the houses of Callis Alley. Rush Grove and part of Artillery Place, to some of these attention was recently somewhat prominently directed. In such a case I think it will be generally admitted that the officials of the Sanitary Authority or even the Sanitary Authority itself should receive any information which gives the impression, rightly or wrongly, of Insanitation, first hand, and not through the columns of the newspapers. The clergy have opportunities of an exceptional character of rendering very real service to the Sanitary Officials in the anxious duties they have to perform, to mention, as example only, the case of overcrowding. The church worker or missionary has a certain limited area under his care, he knows or should know every occupant of every house or room in that area, and he can thus speak with authority on the subject of the number of occupants of a room, when information of a wholly untrustworthy nature is given to the Sanitary Inspector in answer to his enquiries from persons interested in concealing the true state of things. Underground Rooms. The question of underground rooms as dwelling rooms has been under serious consideration so far as Woolwich is concerned, the present stringent regulations on this subject will I think 14 have the effect of abolishing the use of all these places—and here again an additional argument will be found to press forward the consideration of the proper housing of the working classes—for I venture to think it will be impossible for your Hoard to relax the regulations as laid down by the Public Health Act, and I certainly shall be unable from a Public Health point of view to advise any such course to be adopted. Houses let in Lodgings. I regret that the By-laws relative to these have not yet received the approval of the Local Government Board, but when in force I am glad to know we shall have more power for dealing effectively with the houses which will rightly become amenable to them. It will probably be necessary to employ additional help to obtain proper measurments of rooms in houses recommended for registration, and it certainly will be necessary that a re-arrangement of the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors should be made to enable them to deal with the additional work of inspection imposed thereby. Sanitary and other Improvements 1. Doubtless the most important improvement has been the provision of Public Baths at the cost of £28,000, which were formally opened by the Lord Lieutenant of the County, The Duke of Westminster, K.G., on nth June, 1894. They comprise a First-Class Swimming Bath having a superficial area of 4,000 square feet, (100 feet in length and 40 feet in breadth,) containing 127,000 gallons of water. A Second-Class Swimming having a superficial area of 3,600 square feet, (90 feet in length and 40 feet in breadth,) containing 113,000 gallons of water. These Baths are provided with dressing boxes round them, and the First-Class Bath has a gallery to accomodate 500 persons. There are also 52 Private Baths, viz:— Men's First-Class, 10; Women's First-Class, 4; Men's Second-Class, 30; and Women's Second-Class, 8. Since the opening of the Baths till the present time 120,000 persons have used them. 2. The foundation stone of the Brook Hospital was laid on 31st July, 1894, during the meeting of The Congress in London of The British Institute of Public Health. 15 The erection of a Fever Hospital on such an eligible site and in close proximity to Woolwich is one of the greatest benefits from a Public Health point of view that has been conferred upon the district. and it is satisfactory to know that the Hospital will be a Model Institution, embodying all modern improvements and that an Ambulance Station will be associated with it. 3. The river bank at North Woolwich between the Gardens and the Dock entrance has been improved the pathway being asphalted and planted with trees, seats being also provided. 4. Arrangements have been made for the removal of trade refuse, such as Fish Offal, etc., by the provision of air-tight receptacles, trolleys, etc., the refuse being subsequently destroyed in the Destructor. 5. Two new vans have been provided in connection with the Disinfecting arrangements of the district, one for the removal of the infected clothing, &c., the second for the purpose of returning the disinfected articles. 6. Two fire escapes have been stationed in the district, one at North Woolwich, the other in Beresford Square. 7. New labour yards have been opened, one at North Woolwich, the other at Callis Alley. 8. A Soldiers' Institute was opened by H.R.H. The Prince of Wales, in Wellington Street. 9. The Town Hall was connected with the Telephone System. Sanitary Requisites I would again urge upon the Board the desirability of taking the following points into their consideration. 1. The erection of an underground convenience in Beresford Square adequate for the requirements of the district, and on the lines of the admirable structures in other parts of the Metropolis. 16 2. The provision of clerical assistance in the Sanitary Department. This duty, which is now thrown upon the Sanitary Inspectors, interferes greatly with the discharge of their proper duties ; the work in this respect, even during the past two years has doubled itself, and every year brings additional labour in keeping fresh books and making returns. 3. The necessity for taking steps to extend the provisions of the Infectious Disease Notification Act to the Woolwich Garrison. Conclusion. In conclusion I would again acknowledge the kindness and consideration I have received from your Hoard and particularly from the Public Health Committee, to the chairman and members of which I beg to tender my thanks. The inspectors have continued to discharge their duties satisfactorily. Inspector Mackie, at much personal inconvenience, has rendered valuable aid in the ever increasing clerical work of the department. It is satisfactory to note year by year the improvements which are taking place in the conditions under which the people of Woolwich live, improvements which must effect results of a far reaching nature and which in the improved death rate, and in other directions, have already been productive of marked results. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D., D.St., F.R.S., Ed., Medical Officer of Health, and Public Analyst for Woolwich. 17 TABLE I.

Town Hall, Woolwich, 11 th September, 1894. I have much pleasure in presenting my first report of the working of the Refuse Destructor for the period of one year ending the 7th December, 1893. The quantity of refuse that passed through the cells during that period amounted to 9967 loads. The cost of the disposal of which, under the old system of barging away at is. 6d. per cubic yard, would have been £1495 is. od., calculating each load to represent two cubic yards. The outgoings of the Destructor, including Capital and Interest on Loans, Wages, Breeze for Cremator, Gas, Water, and other expenses were as follows:— £ s. d. £ s. d. Capital and Interest on Loans for erection of Destructor 495 0 10 Wages, gross 522 2 4 Cr. Man's time a ”ending to Disinfector, and the value of the Clinkers, &c., used on the roads by Local Board, estimated at 6d. per load 94 2 8 427 19 8 Carting away old tins—115 loads ar 2s. 11 10 0 Breeze for Cremator—292½ cubic yards at 2s. 6d. 36 11 3 Gas 27 6 9 Water 5 3 4 Repairs to Barrows, &c. 10 0 0 New Barrows 13 1 0 £1026 8 2 There was no sale of clinkers or ash during this period. The sale at 6d. per load commenced on the 19th December, 1893. £ s. d. The removal by barges would have cost 1495 1 0 The disposal of the same quantity by Destructor cost 1026 12 10 Shewing saving of £468 8 2 This great saving has far exceeded my expectation. My estimate of the annual saving, dated 13th November, 1893, was £300 per annum. H. O. THOMAS, Surveyor.
