Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report on the public health conditions of your district for the year ending December 31st, 1914. It is obvious that as I undertook duty so late in the year as November, my observations for the most part must be derived directly from the information supplied me. The form in which the late Medical Officer compiled his last Report has been preserved in this. POPULATION. The population at the middle of the year is estimated at 18,000. The number of houses and flats was 4,107. Of this number 3,955 were occupied and 152 unoccupied. The number of houses occupied was 3,823; unoccupied 131. The number of flats occupied was 284; unoccupied 21. BIRTH RATE. The births of 181 boys and 186 girls were registered during the year, making a total of 367, as compared with 359 in 1913. This gives a birth rate of 20'3 per thousand, as compared with 19-9 in 1914. Six illegitimate births (2 males and 4 females) belonging to Harrow occurred outside the District; these added to the 367 births in Harrow give a total of 373 births, and a net birth rate of 20.7. The average for the previous five years is 21.3. The birth rate for England and Wales in 1914 was 23.8, and for the 145 small towns 23.9. 6 DEATH RATE, The total number of deaths registered in the district in 1914 was 120, viz., 57 males and 63 females. Of these 33 were registered in the 1st quarter, 25 in the 2nd quarter, 31 in the 3rd quarter, and 31 in the 4th quarter. Eighteen deaths occurred in the parish of St Mary's, 40 in Roxeth, and 62 in Greenhill. To the above number 120 must be added the deaths of Harrow residents which occurred outside the district less the deaths of Non-residents which occurred within the district, viz., 18, i.e 24 less 6. Total Deaths = 120 + 18 = 138. Particulars of deaths of residents which occurred outside the district and of non-residents which occurred within the district: Six Harrow paupers (one male and five females) died in the Hendon Workhouse. The causes of death and ages are as follows: Atelectasis, age 5 hours 1 Old Age, ages 75 and 85 respectively 2 Cystitis, age 71 1 Anemia, age 55 1 Arthritis, age 60 1 Eighteen Harrow residents died in other outlying institutions. The causes of death, ages and institutions are as follows: Nephritis. 31 years, Middlesex Hospital, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 41 years, Bethnal Green Hospital. Suicide, 23 years, Swanley. Accident, 34 years, Cottage Hospital, Margate. Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 37 years, Colney Hatch Asylum. Pneumonia, 64 years, Middlesex County Asylum. 7 Cerebral Softening, 60 years, Middlesex County Asylum. General Paralysis, 44 years, Middlesex County Asylum. Cancer, 26 years, University College Hospital. Appendicitis, 44 years, Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth. Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 50 years, Northern Hospital. Tubercular Meningitis, 40 years, Brighton. Tubercular Peritonitis, 21 years, St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Atrophic Cirrhosis of Liver, 56 years, London Temperance Hospital. Accident, 20 years, Great Central Railway. Suicide, 38 years, Pinner. Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 41 years, St. George's Hospital. Accident, 21 years, Eltham Cottage Hospital. Six deaths of non-residents occurred in Harrow, viz.:— Pour in the Harrow Cottage Hospital, and two in Harrow, The distribution of these 138 deaths according to age is as follows:— Under 1 year 17 Over 1 year and under 5 6 „ 5 years ,, 15 5 „ 15 „ „ 25 10 ,,25 ,, „ 65 58 „ 65 42 138 This gives a net death rate of 7.6. The corresponding death rate for England and Wales was 14'0, and that for the 145 small towns 12 9. For purposes of comparison with other districts which may have a more favourable or unfavourable population as regards its sex and age constitution, it is necessary to multiply the net death rate by the factor 1 0655 supplied by the Registrar General; the result is the corrected Death Rate of 8.1. 8 INFANTILE DEATH RATE. There were 17 deaths of infants under one year of age «ut of 373 children born, giving an infantile mortality of 48-2 per thousand children born, or 4-8 per cent. Of the above 17 deaths, 3 occurred from prematurity. In 1913 there were 18 deaths, giving an infantile mortality of 49 5, or 5 per cent. In 1912 there were 18 deaths, giving an infantile mortality of 487, or 4'8 per cent. The rate of infantile mortality in England and Wales was 105, and for the 145 small towns 104 per thousand. LONGEVITY OF HARROW RESIDENTS. During the year 47 persons died over the age of 60, or 39 per cent, of the deaths registered. Of these 20 died between the ages of 60 and 70, 17 between 70 and 80, 9 between 80 and 90, and one between 90 and 100. In 1913 the deaths over the age of 60 were nearly 50 per cent, of the deaths registered. HEALTH VISITORS' WORK. The Health Visitors report as follows:— The total number of visits made were 553; Birth enquiries 303, and Infection enquiries 250. Of the 177 babies visited, 146 were breast fed, and 31 bottle fed. The bottle fed babies were fed on cow's milk and barley water. Thee hundred and sixty-four nursing visits were paid to 28 of the babies who were ill. Of these there were 7 cases of Bronchitis, 4 of Whooping Cough and Bronchitis, 4 of Eczema, 2 of Gastro-Enteritis, 2 of Broncho-Pneumonia, 1 of Prematurity, 1 of Marasmus, and and three surgical cases. Two cases of Opthalmia Neonatorum were nursed, 20 visits being paid; four others were reported on only, as these had nurses in residence. All recovered. Infection Enquiries 250. Whooping Cough 109. Chickenpox 73. 9 Whooping Cough has been much in evidence throughout the year; the cases were exceptionally severe and persistent and wTere often accompanied by Bronchitis. A number of cases of Chickenpox occurred in the Spring and again in the Autumn; most of these were of a mild type. There was no case of Measles. Mumps 3. Several cases of swollen glands, sore throats, Impetigo, &c., were reported. Seven Scarlet-fever contacts were examined and reported on; and in connection with these other suspicious cases were kept under observation. This work of the Health Visitors is a most important factor, operating in a number of directions, in the prevention of disease. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Seven cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum have been notified during the year. As this disease is the main cause of blindness in children, all newly born babies suffering from purulent discharge from the eyes should be notified to the Medical Officer of Health, so that the necessary preventive measures may be taken at once. Any waste of time in this matter is highly dangerous. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. One hundred and one cases of Infectious Diseases were notified during the year. They were as follows: — Scarlet-fever 70, Diphtheria 10, Erysipelas 13, Enteric (Typhoid) Fever 1, Ophthalmia Neonatorum 7. There was no death from a notifiable infectious disease during the year. One death was caused by Whooping Cough, and one by Influenza, neither of which disease is notifiable. SCARLET FEVER Seventy cases of this disease were notified during the year as compared with 89 in 1913, 74 in 1912, and 60 in 1911. The disease has been of an extremely mild type, and there has been no case of death. The disease manifested itself at various periods throughout the year, and in November and December assumed epidemic proportions. 1O DIPHTHERIA. Ten cases of this disease have been notified during the year, as compared with 12 in 1913. The majority of the cases were of a mild type. There was no fatal case. DIPHTHERIA ANTI-TOXIN. A fresh supply of this valuable remedy has been kept, as usual, where it can be obtained day and night, at the Isolation Hospital, Roxeth, at the Council Offices, and at the Sanitary Inspector's house, No. 28, Devonshire Road, Greenhill. In cases of Diphtheria, if the anti-toxin be injected during the first 24 hours, the prospects of recovery are good, but every hour that is lost increases the danger. ENTERIC (TYPHOID) FEVER. One case was notified during the year, and was treated in the London Fever Hospital. The "history of this case was thoroughly investigated by Mr. Kramm. Strict precautions are taken to prevent any typhoid excreta passing into the drains. All discharges from the patients are collected by the Council's employees, disinfected and buried. INFLUENZA. One death resulted from Influenza. This disease is highly infectious. Patients suffering from it should be as thoroughly isolated as the circumstances will allow. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. Eighty-nine specimens were sent for examination, 73 Diphtheria, 2 Enteric, and 14 Tuberculosis. Arrangements have been maintained to keep the medical practitioners supplied with the necessary apparatus for sending specimens for bacteriological examination. The Clinical Research Association on receipt of a specimen immediately supplies a new outfit. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. Sixty-one cases of Scarlet-fever (84 in 1913), eight cases of Diphtheria (7 in 1913), were treated in the Hospital, and II the case of Typhoid (Enteric) Fever (1 in 1913) was removed to the London Fever Hospital. The addition to the Hospital, which is in course of erection, is very much needed. Apart from the necessity of isolation it should be widely known that the treatment of infectious diseases and their complications and sequelae can be much better effected in hospital than at home. METHODS OF DISINFECTION. All articles of bedding, wearing apparel, curtains, rugs, etc., are removed to the Hospital and disinfected by means of steam in a Thresh's Saturated Steam Disinfecting Apparatus. Rooms are sprayed with formalin, and then fumigated with vapour of formaldehyde. The staircases, passages, etc., are always sprayed with formalin. Rooms were stripped after cases of infectious diseases in 58 instances. TUBERCULOSIS. Fourteen deaths were caused by Phthisis (Pulmonary Tuberculosis), and four by other tubercular diseases, which amounts to 13 per cent, of the whole mortality. In 1913 the percentage was 9-0, in 1912 8.5, and in 1911 6.8. PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION. Twenty-five cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and twelve other forms of Tuberculosis were notified during the year Sixteen cases were of insured persons under the National Insurance Act, and seven were removed by the Middlesex Insurance Committee for Sanatorium treatment. Of the non-insured persons four were notified by institutions in London where they were receiving treatment. Ten cases were removed by persons interested in them to institutions, and in one case the fees were paid for one month at the Heritage School of Art and Crafts at Chailey. Of the 37 cases, ten had resided in Harrow for a period less than twelve months, 13 for a period over twelve months and under three years, 14 for various periods over three years. 12 Eleven cases worked in London, 16 in Harrow (six were housewives), eight were school children, and two had no occupation. DISINFECTION OF ROOMS USED BY TUBERCULAR PATIENTS. Fifty-eight rooms and 297 articles were disinfected during the year. Cards of instruction, sputum bottles and disinfectants are provided free. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. A Dispensary for Area No. 3 under the scheme of the County Council for dealing with Tuberculosis under the National Insurance Act in Middlesex is now open. The Dispensary is situated at 38, Welldon Crescent, Harrow, and is under the charge of Dr. Munro, one of the Tuberculosis Medical Officers in the Public Health Department of the County Council. CANCER. During the year 20 deaths were caused by Cancer, as compared with 18 from Pulmonary and other Tubercular Diseases. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. There are four houses registered. It became necessary to call the owner's attention to the insanitary condition of one of these houses. He had the necessary work immediately effected. There can be no doubt that many such houses remain unregistered. COMMON LODGING HOUSE. There is one registered Common Lodging House. Periodical inspection has been made, and the premises have always been found in a fairly satisfactory condition. 13 SCAVENGING. A weekly collection of house refuse was carried out during the year. Twenty-three complaints of non-collection were received, a number somewhat larger than usual. I note that most of these have been made immediately after one of the Bank Holidays, notwithstanding the fact that extra carts are then put in service. The collection of trade refuse and fish offal from some of the fishmongers in the district, upon whom a charge is made, has been continued, and has prevented, I believe, considerable cause of complaint to those living in close proximity. DAIRY FARMS, ETC. There are 7 Dairy Farms, 14 Milk Shops, 14 Bakehouses (1 underground), 6 Slaughter Houses, 26 Butchers' Shops, 14 Fish Shops, and 7 Laundries. With few exceptions all these premises have been kept in a satisfactory condition. I recently made an inspection of most of the cowsheds and dairies and found the conditions fairly good. MILK SUPPLY. Thirty-eight samples of milk were tested bacteriologically for B. tuberculosis. Five per cent, were returned as containing B.t. The respective County Councils were immediately advised; in three cases the Veterinary Inspector condemned the cow, which was accordingly destroyed. Owing to the War, the Board of Agriculture saw fit to withdraw the Tuberculosis Order of 1914, which had come into operation in May last; this prevented action being taken in the case of a further infected milk supply. I recommend the Council, however, to continue the examination of milk and to notify the dairymen with whom infected milk is found. I am confident that these men will continue to lend us their loyal support. They are to be commended for the manner in which they have assisted your officers in preventing the sale of infected milk to Harrow. 14 VETERINARY INSPECTION OF COWS AND OTHER BOVINE ANIMALS. Periodical inspection of dairy animals by a competent Veterinary Surgeon is an important item in the prevention of tuberculosis in cows and in milk. FISH FRYING. There are five establishments in Harrow carrying on this business under the Bye-laws regulating offensive trades (Section 112 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by Section 51 of the Public Health Act, Amendment Act, 1907). No complaint was made concerning any of these establish ments. WATER SUPPLY. Analyses of the Public Water Supply (Colne Valley Water Co.) were made four times during the year and showed that the samples of water were satisfactory from the point of view of organic matter. This water is fairly soft. The following is the last report received from the Analyst:— Parts per Grains per (1). Chemical— 100,000. gallon. Total solids (dried at 120° c.) 24.3 17.0 Combined chlorine 2.10 1.47 equivalent to Na C1 3.47 2.43 Nitric nitrogen 0.60 0.42 Nitrous nitrogen Nil Nil Ammoniacal nitrogen Nil Nil Albumenoid nitrogen 0.0054 0.0038 Oxygen absorbed in 4 hours at 27 c. 0 040 0.028 Lead or Copper Nil Nil Temporary hardness (equivalent to Ca Cos) 6.8 4.8 Permanent hardness 8.5 5.9 Total hardness 15.3 10.7 Bacteriological.

Streptocci „ „ 30 „ B. Enteritidis Sporogenes „ „ 100 „ These results show the sample to be of satisfactory bacterial purity. ICE CREAM SHOPS. There are 22 ice cream premises in the district, most of which are also sweet shops. Inspections were made during the Summer, and all the establishments were found in a satisfactory condition. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. There are four registered and two licensed slaughterhouses in the district. Inspections as usual have been carried out when slaughtering is in progress. The butchers afford every assistance to the Inspector in this work; one tubercular pig was surrendered. Mr. Kramm, your Inspector, holds the certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute for Inspectors of Meat and other Foods. TOWN PLANNING. The Council awaits permission from the Local Government Board to prepare a Town Planning Scheme. HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION. Sixty-seven houses in West Street and Crown Street were inspected under Section 17 of the Housing and Town Planning &c. Act, 1909. The principal sanitary defects found were dampness, due to absencejof damp proof courses; defective roofs and gutters; unpaved yards; and absence of portable sanitary dustbins. Four houses unfit for human habitation were voluntarily closed by the owner; but at the end of the year work necessary to render them habitable was proceeding satisfactorily. The owner of Nos. 2, 3, and 3a, Waldrons Yard has given an undertaking to close these houses. 16 The superintendence of work intended to remedy sanitary defects in other houses has absorbed a considerable amount of the Inspector's time; and in this connection it may be noted that the clerical assistance recently provided by the Council has been a boon to the Department. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Home-workers' premises have been inspected during the year. The number of inspections made and sanitary defects found to exist are shown in Table 6. MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. The County Medical Officer of Health reports as follows: Owing to alteration in the age groups required to be individually examined by the Board of Education and to changes in staff, it has only been possible to make two routine inspections of each school during 1914. Nine hundred and four children were examined. Age Group. Boys. Girls. Entrants 4 and 5 years 140 128 Intermediate Group, 8 years 63 52 Leavers 12 years and over 259 230 *Other Ages 17 15 479 425 *Children presented for some special reason for medical inspection, and not coming within the groups required for routine inspection. All the schools were visited twice during the year. In addition to these many other visits were again made in order:— 1. To "follow up" those children who were advised to seek treatment for some defective condition found at the time of inspection. 2. To make more detailed examination of "special children" (these include children in whom the suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis, mental deficiency, or other grave organic defect has arisen at the time of routine inspection). 17 3. To examine children excluded from schools on account of ringworm or other contagious disease as to their fitness to return to school. 4. To examine the children in the schools with the object of controlling the spread of infectious diseases by the discovery of early or "missed" cases of such diseases, which might have been of so mild a type as to be overlooked by the parents and allowed to attend school. In connection with the occurrence of infectious diseases amongst school children, the system of intercommunication between the Public Health Department of the District Council and the School Medical Officer continues to work very satisfactory and is of undoubted value. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. Dr. Young, the Medical Officer of Health, has forwarded me the following particulars of the County Inspector's work during 1914:— Article. Taken. Adulterated. Milk 106 25 Butter 66 Coffee 4 — Castor Sugar 4 White Precipitate Ointment 2 1 Total 182 26 HARROW BOUNDARIES. It is hoped that when the Town planning scheme is. accomplished the Mount Park area will be included in Harrow, as to Harrow it naturally belongs. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. Mr. J. Percy Bennetts, your Engineer and Surveyor, reports:— The number of plans approved by the Council was: 79 Houses, 12 Shops and Dwelling Houses, 2 Flats, 17 Alterations and Additions, 2 new Buildings (not dwellings),, 1 Hall, and 4 Temporary Buildings. 18 51 Shops and 4 combined shops and dwelling houses have been erected and approved on completion. The Mortuary has been used in 12 cases. The additional 8 acres of land acquired by the Council for allotments have been set out and about 6 acres let. The effluent from both sewage farms has been very satisfactory, and no complaints have been received. The Wealdstone Council are proceeding with the necessary works for the purpose of treating the sewage discharging at the Council's Greenhill Farm, and it is expected the connection will be made shortly. This will mean the disuse for the present of the Greenhill Farm for sewage disposal purposes. A scheme for the letting of some portions of the Farm to the Wealdstone Council for allotment purposes has been approved. The following private streets have been taken over as highways repairable by the inhabitants at large, viz.: Kingsley, Eastcote, Whitby, Wargrave, Scarsdale and Wyvenhoe Roads. That portion of South Hill Avenue between Northolt Road and the Council's boundary has been made up under the Public Health Act. The laying out of the Open Space at Lowlands, and the widening of Lowlands Road from the Metropolitan Station Approach to Grove Hill Road has been started. The widening of Byron Hill has also been sanctioned and the land required for the purpose obtained. A new 9" Sewer has been laid from Kenton Road under the Metropolitan and Great Central Railways to Sheepcote Road. Local Government Board inquiries have been held in connection with Lowlands Road Improvement, Byron Hill Improvement, and the laying out of Lowlands Open Space. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. The rainfall for the year was 27-80, which is 5-39 more than in 1913, when it was 22-41. The rainfall for the previous ten years is as follows: — 1913, 22.41; 1912, 31.00; 1911, 28.86; 1910, 28.42; 1909, 27.85; 1908, 27.48; 1907, 28.86; 1906, 26.33; 1905, 22.94; 1904, 24 56. The average for these years is 26.8. 19 The days on which .01 or more inches fell was December 26, March 25, November 18, July 17, February 16, May 13, October 13, January 12, August 11, September 10, June 10,. April 9. The highest temperatures were 88° in July, 85° in May, 81° in August, 79° in September, 79° in May. The lowest temperatures were 17° in January, 27° in March, 28° in February, 28° in December, 32° in April. The highest mean temperatures were 72° in August, 71° in July, 70° in June, 67° in September, 62° in May, 59° in April, 58° in October. The lowest mean temperatures were 31° in January, 36°' in March, 37° in February, 42° in December. 1 append the usual tables of vital statistics, etc. I remain, Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, DAVID SOMMERVILLE„.
