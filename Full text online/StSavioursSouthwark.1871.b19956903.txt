Compiled and published in accordance with the 108th section of 18 and 19 Viet., c. 120- An Act for the better Local Management of the Metropolis, and respectiully presented to the Inhabitants of the District. I CLERK'S REPORT. Since my last Annual R.-port. dated the 24th June, 1871, the street houses and prcilUMI in Holland Street, Blackfriars Road, have Nomenclature been renumbered, and the thoroughfare formerly known by the names of Park Street and New Park Street, has been incorporated under the name of Park Street, and the numbering of the houses B&C. revised and attend, pursuant to orders of the Metropolitan Board, dated the 1st of December, 1871. The Board have extended, in the direction of London Bridge, Borough the Limmer Asphalte which was being put down on the eastern High Street, footway of the Borough High Street at the date of my last Report, and the whole of that footway from King Street to Denman Street is now paved with it. The cost of this Asphalte for footways is about two-thirds of that of York Stone. The Blackfriars Road Paving Works in Blackfriars Road, (carriage way,) also referred to in my Report, are being further extended on the east side of the road, from Kdward Street as far as the Surrey Chapel, at an estimated expense of £1012. This Company have proceeded, under the powers conferred by London their various Acts of Parliament, to stop up John Street and Chatham and Cumberland Street in the Parish of Christchurch, for the purpose of increasing their station accommodation in the Blackfriars Road, but have not yet closed Holland Street. They have widened Green Walk as required by sect. 8 of the 28 & 29 Vict., cap. 269, making it of the dear width of 50 feet throughout. The Com- pany were bound, by an agreement entered into with the Boaid in the year 1864, to pave the carriage way of Green W alk with granite cubes, and the footways with York flags at then own expense, prior to delivering up the Street for the use or the public, but the Board preferring Asphalte, the Company consented to put that down in lieu of stone, and the whole suiface is now 4 paved with Limmer Asphalte. A question has arisen as to whether it was competent for the Company to dispose of any portion of the site of Cumberland Street for other than Railway purposes, they having sold a plot of laud to certain parties for the erection of a public house and other buildings, as surplus land, and the Board have now under consideration the propriety of enforcing a claim for compensation, which they have made against the Company. Tramways. The London Street Tramway Company have a Bill before Parliament to authorise the construction of additional Street Tramways in the Counties of Middlesex and Surrey, and the City of London, and for other purposes, by which Bill, power was sought (inter alia) to lay down Tramways in that part of the Borough High Street, between Southwark Street and the Railway Termini at London Bridge; but, in consequence of the opposition of this Board, the proposal has been abandoned, and clause 33a struck out of the Bill. Copyhold In the year 1864, a plot of copyhold land at the corner of Land Broadwall, and Commercial Road, Lambeth, together with the Broadwall. messuage or tenement standing thereupon, was purchased for the purpose of setting back the frontage, and widening the Street, and the improvement having been effected, a small vacant pieco of land remained fenced in and unproductive. This surplus land the Board have lately sold, at the price of £110, to Mr. John Mills, of No. 59, Broadwall, and the sum has been placed to the credit of Christchurch. Precepti.

Board Room and Offices, Emerson Street, Bankside, Southwark, S.E. June, 1872, 5 MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. Gentlemen The number of the population of London and its sub-districts having been correctly ascertained since the last annual report made to this Board, I am now able to present the statistics of mortality in a form of greater accuracy, so far as respects the comparative tables, than has been possible since the previous census. During the past ten years the number of inhabitants of Saint Saviour's District has considerably diminished. The total population is now 30,250. This number being deducted from that given in 1861, shows a decrease of 5,367. In the parish of Saint Saviour a diminution appeared both in 1861 and 1871, while in Christchurch the returns show a continual increase until the last enumeration. During the past twenty years the total decrease of the population of Saint Saviour has been at the rate of 20, and of Christchurch 8 per cent. There were during the year 1,055 births, and 840 deaths. The births were 65 fewer, and the deaths 91 in excess of the number registered in 1870. It should be observed that the mortality of 1870 was exceptionally small, and although during the past year it was large, it was nevertheless a very little above the decennial average. That this excess of mortality in the district is not due to epidemic disease is an encouraging fact, the deaths under this head being three fewer than those of the previous year. Excluding Small Pox from the calculation, the decrease would have been considerable. From Fever and Diarrhoea alone the deaths registered were 53 fewer than in 1870. The deaths in the Metropolis referred to Diarrhoea in 1871 far exceeded the number registered in any year since 1859. In Saint Saviour's District there was a diminution of 22. As fever and Diarrhoea are the best sanitary tests of the condition of a locality, this is a most satisfactory sign of improvement in your district. The increased mortality is therefore due to diseases which it is impossible to specify in the limited space of a report, and to the prevalence of Small Pox. The existence of a workhouse in your district, exclusively devoted to the reception of aged men, will always cause a comparatively high rate of mortality for the whole district to be exhsltcd. The death rate in London was nearly 25 per thousand, in the South a little more than 24, while in this district it was above 27. But it the numbers in the woikhouse and hospital arc eliminated from the population, as well as the deaths from no the Registrar's books, it will be seen that the death rate of the district is only a small fraction beyond 24 per thousand. Taking the inmates of the workhouse at an average of 450, the death rate would be exactly 220 per thousand, which, when introduced into the estimate for the whole district, gives an apparent excess of mortality as compared with othee lcalities. 6 The death rate from Small Pox in London during the year was 24 per thousand, and in Saint Saviour's district 21. This estimate is probably not strictly accurate, as many deaths occurred in public institutions ; but there is little doubt, if they could be fairly distributed among the various districts of the Metropolis, Saint Saviour's would not be in excess of the average. From Zymotic diseases almost all epidemics arise. The assumption, which appears to be well grounded, is, that these diseases arc originated by the invasion of self-multiplying molecules in the simplest form of life, which generate with marvellous rapidity; and precaution is absolutely necessary to restrain the spread of diseases of that class. To prevent Small Pox, Vaccination is necessary. The diffusion of this disease is doubtless considerably limited by the antidote; but the severity of all epidemics depends on certain conditions, such as clean households, disinfectants, and pure water. Assisted by your inspector, I have endeavoured to secure these objects. Over the Water Companies the local control is comparatively limited; but in other respects the sanitary tables will convince you that our labours have been unremitting. The Hoard of Guardians and their officers have co-operated to prevent the spread of this most offensive disease. When its prevalence became apparent, they instructed the public Vaccinators to impress upon all the necessity of Vaccination, issued notices, and, for the convenience of the public, arranged bi-weekly attendance at the public stations. The Relieving Officers of the respective districts, although not instructed by the Guardians, afforded every information for the detection and limitation of the disease. Houses to the number of 125 were purified, a considerable quantity of bedding and clothes disinfected or destroyed, and the bodies of those who unhappily succumbed to the ravages of the disease were isolated by being removed to the dead-house of the' District. It may fairly bo presumed that these efforts were in some measure instrumental in arresting its progress. From the evidence already adduced, it will be apparent that all a Local Board could do has been done. I have hitherto insisted, year by year, upon the necessity of superior and more convenient domiciles for the poor in the neighbourhood in which they reside. This necessity is now more generally acknowledged than was the case a few years since. Notwithstanding the facilities afforded by Railway Companies for relieving this pressure, there are too many conditions of a working man's life which render it imperative that he should reside near his place of employment; and while a whole family is compelled to squeeze into any lodging obtainable near the industrial centre, one of the most important conditions of health is wanting. Of the necessity for pure water for the preservation of health, and the proper use of disinfectants in times of disease, there can be no question. But a brief reference to these points may very properly find a place in this Report. 7 The disinfectants which arc mostly employed are Chloride of Lune, Carbolic Acid, Chloralum, and McDougall's Powder In cases where gases are evolved from putrefying animal matter, volatile disinfectants are beet. The remarks made by a writer in the ''Times last year an peculiarly appropriate. There is no gas equal to Chlorine, there is none so cheap or thoroughly leflective in altering the character for good of noxious gases and none so easy of application. As long as it is in excess' or, in other words, preponderates over the injurious hydrogen' compounds, it can be recognized by its odour. There is only one serious objection to Chlorine—its Smell. But if it be properly used and not wasted, this objection will be reduced to a minimum. Except in the ease; of Closets, (where it is best to dust a small quantity in the pan above the reach of water,) a solution of Chloride of Lime in the proj>ortion of lib to lOlbs of Water is most adapted for disinfecting air:—a rag as large as an ordinary handkerchief stceped in such a solution, wrung out and suspended in small rooms, will sweeten the air for twentyfour hours. The Chlorine slowly evolved acts partly in decomposing in hurious hydrogen compounds, partly in evolving ozone; it is therefore a grand oxydizing agent. Chloralum, the last discovered disinfectant, cannot be substituted for Chlorine. A fixed non-volatile substance cannot take the place as a disinfectant of volatile substances. When we come to disinfect decomposable matter, it is our task to prevent such matter from decomposing, and we have generally to do with solid bodies. Here, Carbolic Acid is the best disinfectant. The evil of Carbolic Acid is in the deceptive character of the common Sort. The impurities give the disagreeable and disgusting smell, and the odours attending may give a false notion of security. Sprinkled against bricks in a sewer, out of reach of water, all the smell supposed to proceed from Carbolic Acid may continue to be evolved for months, whereas nothing in the way of disinfection is being accomplished. Lastly, Carbolic Acid is readily diffused through air, Chloralum is not. Professor Fkvnki.and, in his report on the analysis of the waters supplied by the Metropolitan Water Companies, during the several months of the year 1870, says: "During the past fear I have investigated Clark's process for softening water by the addition of Lime, and have inquired into the application of this process to the water supplied to London. By an inspection of the beautiful waterworks established by Mr. Homersham, C.E., at Tring and Canterbury, I have convinced myself of the perfect feasibility of applying the method of purification to such Vast volumes of water as those supplied to the Metropolis, and by the use of the process for several months past in softening the Grand Junction Company's water supplied to my own house, I have demonstrated that this admirable method (which is now free from all patent rights) is even more valuable when applied to Thames water, than when used for the softening of chalk 8 spring's; a fact "which had previously been doubted and even denied. Chalk spring water is merely softened by this process; on the other hand, Thames water, which contains a large proportion of nitrogenous organic matter, derived partly from the drainage of 800,000 people in the river above the in-take of the water companies is, by the application to it of Clark's process, not only rendered as soft, or nearly so, as the chalk water similarly treated, but a considerable proportion of the organic matter which it contains in solution is removed by becoming attached to the precipitate of chalk which is produced by the addition of slaked lime to the water. The cost of applying this process to the London Water supply would be, 14s. 7d. per 1,000,000 gallons. This includes labour, cost of Lime, and interest on Capital required for reservoirs and apparatus. Clark's process of softening is only applicable to such water as owes its hardness entirely or chiefly to t lie Carbonate of Lime and Magnesia, held in solution by Carbonic Acid. All the water supplied to London is of this character. The following is the method of performing the operation upon London Water. To soften 500 gallons of the water supplied by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand Junction, Lambeth, New River, or East London Company, slake thoroughly 12oz. of Quick Lime in a pail-full of water, stir up the Milk of Lime, and pour it immediately into a Cistern containing at least 30 gallons of the water to be softened, taking care to leave in the pail any heavy sediment that may have settled in the bottom in the few seconds that intervene between the stirring and pouring. Fill the pail again with water, and stir and pour as before. The remainder of the 500 gallons of water must then be added or allowed to run into the Cistern from the supply pipe. If the rush of the water thus added, does not thoroughly mix the contents of the Cistern, this must be accomplished by stirring with a suitable wooden paddle. The water will now appear very milky, owing to the precipitation of the Chalk which it previously held in solution, together with an equal quantity of Chalk which is formed from the quick lime added. After standing for three hours the water will be sufficiently clear to be used for washing, but to render it transparent enough for drinking, at least twelve hours settlement is required. It deserves again to be mentioned that the patent for this valuable process having expired, the public are now free to use it, but, the system of intermittent supply, which is still maintained in London, oppose a serious obstacle to its adoption in private houses, on account of the necessity of performing the operation in the few minutes during which the water is daily delivered from the Companies' mains. I may here remark, that Section 7 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, enables the Metropolitan Authority,—The Metropolitan Board of Works, after the expiration of eight months from the passing of the Act, to require the Water Companies to afford 9 a constant supply. The Act is dated 21st August, 1871, and [might therefore have been made operative from and after the 21st April last; four months notice has to be given by the Metropolitan Authority, and the owners of houses have previously to provide the requisite fittings, Ac. The probability of an epidemic of Cholera in this country during the ensuing summer, deserves our most serious consideration5. This question cannot lie absolutely decided by any calculation, but we can ensider some important facts, which'may guide us in our (enquiry. In August, last, Cholera prevailed to a great extent in Russia, and there was a manifest diffusion of the epidemic towards the West, some towns in Eastern Germany suffered severely, and the disease was expected in Berlin and in Paris. But as a matter of fact. Cholera did not advance; it never reached Paris, or scarcely Berlin, but attacked Constantinople with the greatest severity. By tyhe end of September, it was abating in every part of the Russian Umpire, but, on the other hand, its ravages in the South East were very severe. It would seem to follow, that as there has been no decided advance of Cholera from the South East to the North West, or from India to England, there can be no corresponding prospect of danger for us in the coming summer; for, in the whole of our experieence in this matter, there is no instance to be found of an invasion of Cholera, without a premonitory outbreak. The only feature in the records of public health carrying any significance with it was an extraordinary prevalence and fatality of Diarrhoea, though chiefly among children. Otherwise, the cases of Sp[oradic Cholera, which occur with greater or less frequency in all summers, were fewer than usual. Judging', therefore, by precedent, we should infer that no especial danger need be apprehended in 1872. For the last five years, Cholera has been more or less epidemic in Russia, and it is not to be disguised that we have Cholera, as it were, settled in Europe; and that if it should be permanently localized in Russia, the risk of an outbreak in this country will always be more or less probable. It behoves us, therefore, to persevere in our most strenuous efforts to maintain such sanitary conditions as experience has taught us are the best safeguards against the approach of this formidable malady. With these few observations I commend to your consideiation the accompanying tables. You will perceive that your inspector has been zealous in his exertions to do his part in staying the progress of disease; and all the officers connected with district have united in endeavouring to promote the general goot. To them and to every member of this board I beg to tender my best thanks for their co-operation. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI.
