The most notable feature in the vital statistics is the further decline in the Infantile Mortality Rate, The number of infant deaths fell, giving an infant death rate of 15 94 per 1,000 live births compared with 20.7 in 1952 This rate shares with that for the year 1950, the distinction of being the lowest on record Of the 32 deaths which occurred, 21 were children under the age of four weeks, thus giving a neo natal mortality rate of 10 46 per 1,000 live birthsi One illegitimate child only, out of 101 illegitimate births, died before reaching the age of 1 year. This gives an infantile mortality rate for this group of 10 00 per 1.000 illegitimate live births This is a reversal of what has prevailed in the past and as recently as 1938 the mortality amongst illegitimate children was double that of the legitimate This is probably due to the increasing care which is being devoted to the unmarried mother and her child and which in return is reflected in a higher sense of maternal responsibility. The corrected death rate for the district was 9 89 per 1,000 home population compared with 11 4 for England and Wales, Heart and associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths, 521 people dying from these causes. Cancer deaths, while second in the principal causes, were less than in 1952 One woman died as a result of childbirth, giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.49 per 1,000 total births which compares favourably with that, for the country as a whole. There was an increase of 1,191 in the number of notifications of infectious disease compared with the previous year, due mainly to an outbreak of measles which commenced in the last quarter of 1952 and continued into 1953 4 The incidence of Poliomyelitis showed little change There is an impression in the public mind that this disease was practically unknown in the country until the post war years. This, however, is not the case as, while the incidence was consistently lower, sporadic cases continued to occur from time to time and, in the year 1930, 6 cases were recorded and there were 2 deaths. Unfortunately for the first time since 1949 a case of Diphtheria occurred, details of which are given in the body of the report Probably the most dramatic reduction in infectious disease following an active measure of control, namely, immunisation, has occurred in this disease with a consequent reduction in the toll of human suffering and invalidism The number of primary notifications of Tuberculosis again fell but the number of deaths from this disease remained the same as in 1952' In an aging population the problem of old people in need of some help continues to increase As before, the policy has been continued of endeavouring to provide assistance in their own homes and in this way avoiding the need for institutional care. In 16 cases, however, where the old people were in need of proper care and attention the Public Health Department was called in with a view to statutory action being taken Fortunately this was not necessary and an improvement was effected informally by the provision of Home Helps and, where necessary Home Nursing, or by the person concerned consenting to be removed to an institution A report on the activities of the Old People s Welfare Committee is given elsewhere and the work done by it and by the voluntary organisations is worthy of the highest praise There has been no relaxation in the field of environmental health Much of the work is the responsibility of the Sanitary Inspectors and it will be seen from the report how extensive and varied their duties are proposed legislation, particularly in connection with Housing and Food and Drugs must inevitably throw increased work and responsibility upon them In conclusion I wish to thank the Members of the Council for their continued support and encouragement and also the members of my staff for their loyal and conscientious service during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, A, FAIRGRIEVE ADAMSON, Medical Officer of Health., 5 SECTION A: STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA, STATISTICS.

The figures for fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those in the list of causes of death supplied by the Registrar-General. The latter refer to the deaths of Hendon residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Hendon or some other outside district. I am indebted to the Town Clerk for supplying me with the figures.

Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 3 10 7 3 In seven cases the cause of the infection was unknown and the agent was identified in sixteen. Cl. Welchii 1 Shigella Sonnei 1 Salmonella Typhi Murium 13 Salmonella Oranienburg 1 Of the twenty three cases, nine occurred in three families the others being single cases spread throughout the Borough. Poliomyelitis. There was an increase in the number of cases of Poliomyelitis, nineteen cases being notified compared with eighteen in 1952. The cases were spread throughout the year as follows:January 3; April 1; May 2; June 3; July 4; August 3; September 2; November 1. Eleven of the cases occurred in the age group 0 -10 years, the ages of the remainder ranging from 13 - 36 years. Of the nineteen cases notified thirteen were Paralytic and six Non-Paralytic.

The case of Para-Typhoid Fever was a boy aged 14 years. He was one of a party of school children who visited Switzerland, Owing to the difficulties of a general strike in France the return journey was prolonged and apparently undertaken under extreme difficulties. On arrival home the boy was stated to have been ill and was removed to hospital. Para-Typhoid Fever was diagnosed some three to four days later. It would appear that the disease was contracted abroad Scarlet Fever. There was an increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year, 227 cases being notified 21 compared with 216 in 1952 Once again the disease was of a mild form and 87 of the cases were removed to hospital The greatest incidence occurred in the age group 5-9 years} 136 cases being notified in this group. Measles. The reduced incidence of Measles experienced during 1952 was not maintained in 1953, 2096 cases being notified As was pointed out in my last report, of the 867 cases notified in 1952, 621 occurred during the last quarter of the year, thus appearing to indicate a considerable out break in 1953 and this proved to be the case Of the 2096 cases, 1965 were notified during the first quarter of the year; 119 in the second; 7 in the third and 5 in the last Whooping Cough. This disease showed a reduction on the 1952 figure, 407 cases being notified compared with 508 last year Malaria. The two cases of Malaria notified were contracted abroad Puerperal Pyrexia, The number of cases of Puerperal Pyrexia again in creased, 151 cases being notified compared with 138 in 1952, 149 of them occurring in hospital. The notification rate for Puerperal Pyrexia in respect of the Borough of Hendon is 73 94 per 1,000 total (live and still) births which is higher than the rate of 18 23 per 1,000 total births for the country as a whole Situated within the Borough is a Maternity Hospital which provides accommodation not only for the Borough of Hendon but also for the surrounding districts When Puerperal Pyrexia occurs in women normally resident in these outside districts who enter the hospital for their confinements, the notification has to be accepted by the Borough of Hendon. Under the Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations, 1951, "Puerperal Pyrexia" means any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within 14 days after childbirth or miscarriage. Under previous regulations the temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit had to be maintained during a period of 24 hours or had to recur during that period. The new regulations, however, make it necessary only for the temperature to occur. These factors combined would appear to 22 be contributory to the high Puerperal Pyrexia rate for the Borough Of the 151 cases notified 49 only were Hendon residents. If this figure is taken the notification rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births is 23 42 This figure approximates to that for the London Administrative County which is 28 61 per 1.000 total births and that for 160 County Boroughs and Great Towns which is 24.33 per 1,000 total births. Diphtheria. During the year one case of Diphtheria was notified. This was the first case to be notified in the Borough since 1949. The Patient, a boy aged 14 years, had been successfully immunised against Diphtheria in 1941 and had received a reinforcing Injection in 1947 Prior to his admission to hospital he had been on holiday in Penzance The boy reovered from the attack. The following table shows the number of notifications received since the inception of the Diphtheria Immunisation Scheme in 1935 TABLE XI Year. No. of Cases of Diphtheria Notified.

Three of them were passengers on board the M.S "Batory" from which a case of smallpox was removed during the voyage and the other 5, contacts of a suspected case from the Yorkshire and Lancashire outbreak. The necessary steps were taken for the surveillance of these contacts and no case of smallpox occurred within the Borough Vaccination The following table, the figures for which have been supplied by the Area Office of the Middlesex County Council, shows the number of persons vaccinated and revaccinated in the Borough of Hendon during 1953 TABLE XIV Age at 31st December 1953 Under 1 year 1-4 years 5-14 years 15 years or over.

F. 728 599 87 73 815 672 1327 160 1487 I am indebted to Dr H.J. Trenchard, Physician-inCharge of the Edgware Chest Clinic, which serves an area comprising the Borough of Hendon and the Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of Harrow and Wembley,, for the following report on the work of the clinic during the year:- Statistics showing the previous Pour Years for Comparison 1949 1950 19S1 19S2 1953 New patients referred to clinic 4,332 4,156 6,107 7,133 8,295 Total attendances 20,665 26,297 30.046 30,183 30,644 Total attendances for refills 10,614 11,711 12,214 11,443 10,114 No of home visits by physicians 281 358 291 300 383 No of persons X-rayed 10,011 16,717 14,552 18,388 16,537 No of contacts seen 2,820 4,545 4,439 4,322 5,375 Tuberculosis Register New Respiratory cases of Tuberculosis 225 172 178 184 171 New non-respiratory cases of Tuberculosis 19 21 24 28 16 Tuberculous cases on register on 3lst December 1,669 1,750 1,753 1,761 1,764 Removed from register because of death 56 31 40 47 44 Removed from register as recovered 26 62 66 72 54 No of tuberculous patients awaiting admission on 31st December 103 115 91 95 48 The attendances at Edgware Chest Clinic have remained at a high level during 1953, and although there has been little change in the total numbers, new patient attendances have increased The winter of 1952-53 brought the notorious smog which caused a great increase in respiratory diseases and deaths therefrom The work in the first half of 1953 was consequently extremely heavy and led to great strain This resulted in the illness of one of the medical staff. It was realised that the staff needed to be strengthened and an additional assistant physician was appointed to undertake some extra sessions at the clinic. 27 The use of the Odelca camera, referred to in the report for 1952, has continued It has resulted in considerable financial economies in the X-Ray Department as most of the routine work, including the X-ray of patients for their general practitioners, is done making use of it It is also employed for the routine X-ray examination of members of the Hospital staff and for ante-natal patients So far as tuberculosis is concerned, the overall picture shows some improvement compared with previous years There has been little increase in the size of the clinic's register of tuberculous patients, and although the problem of shortage of beds is not solved, the position is easier than it used to be and the waiting period before admission is shorter. Certain members of the clinic staff are officers of the Middlesex County Council, the authority responsible for the preventive and care aspects of tuberculosis. They work under the medical staff and assist in the sociomedical aspects of the management of the disease. In addition, a number of surveys of schools have been undertaken on behalf of the local medical officers of health, and some small surveys have also been made of fellow employees of tuberculous patients When a survey is required at a large unit (factory, workshop, etc ) the matter has been referred to the Mass X-ray Units which have the staff and facilities for this type of work The Chest Clinic staff have assisted in the Medical Research Council's investigation into the results of certain methods of treatment of tuberculosis, and a number of Postgraduate scholars have been attached for various periods to obtain experience in chest diseases." 28 SECTION C: GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment. MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL ACT, 1944. SECTIONS 353-363. The Council continued to exercise its function as a licensing authority under the provisions of the abovementioned Act A person requiring a licence or renewal of a licence under this part of the Act must make application to the Local Authority giving certain information, such as age, nationality, technical qualifications and the nature of the Establishment and the business conducted thereat The Council considered the following number of applications:- New Licences 7 Renewals of Licences 23 Certificates lodged under Section 363 by members of the Chartered Society of Physio-therapy 5 Licences Refused NIL NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948. Section 90 - Public Burials. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1948, the Hendon Borough Council is required to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area if in such cases it appears to the Council that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. During the year burial was carried out by the Council in three cases, made up as follows:- one adult female, one male stillborn child and one female stillborn child. The necessary steps were taken to recover the cost of burial in all cases. 29 Section 47. This section deals with securing the necessary care and attention for persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention During the year under review it was not found necessary to take formal action under this section Fourteen cases however, involving six males and ten females, were dealt with by informal action thereby bringing about the necessary improvement in their condition HOSPITAL FACILITES General Hospital Facilities.

There is also a Chest Clinic at Edgware serving primarily those living in the Borough of Hendon and the Stanmore, Queensbury and Kingsbury districts of Harrow and Wembley. 30 Health Services Provided by the Middlesex County Council. The following services are provided by the Middlesex County Council under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946:- Maternity and Child Welfare Services, including Priority Dental Service and Domiciliary Midwifery Health Visiting Home Nursing Domestic Help Day Nurseries Vaccination and Immunisation These services are administered on an area basis, Area No. 4 consisting of the Boroughs of Hendon and Finchley. An Area Committee has been formed which acts as a Sub-Committee of the Public Health Committee of the County Council and consists of representatives of the two Boroughs, Middlesex County Council, certain professional bodies and other persons with special knowledge of these services. Laboratory Facilities. These are provided at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. I would like to express my appreciation of the work carried out by the staff of the Laboratory who have cooperated whole-heartedly with the Public Health Department. A record of the work carried out on behalf of the Health Department is given in the following table:- 31 TABLE XVII RECORD OF EXAMINATIONS Year 1953 Throat/Nose Swabs. Faeces. Sputum. Pertussis.

Medical Examinations During the year 82 employees of the Hendon Borough Council were medically examined for superannuation purposes. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE I am indebted to the Honorary Secretary of the Borough of Hendon Old People's Welfare Committee for the following report on the activities of the Committee during the year 1953-54- 32 During the period under review the Main Committee met on four occasions and it was found necessary only to hold two meetings of the Finance and Executive Subcommittee. Visiting This service continued throughout the year. There is considerable distress at the condition in which many sick and infirm people are found The Committee would welcome additional names of both ladies and gentlemen who could spare a short time to assist in visiting The number of such visits is contained elsewhere in this report Appreciation must be expressed of the services rendered in this connection by the Home Nurses and Home Helps. Chiropody. The importance of this service to old people is becoming increasingly recognised throughout the Country and thanks are due to the British Red Cross Society that such a service has been established in Hendon During the period under review 218 cases were treated and a grant has been made by the Welfare Committee to meet part of the deficit on this service Night Attendant Service. The demand for this service, instituted in the Autumn of 1953 for the purpose of giving those who are looking after old people an opportunity of a night's rest has not been so great as was expected. It is hoped, however, that with increased publicity, the number of cases will increase. The Service is available to necessitous cases free of charge, but in other cases payment is expected up to a maximum of 12/6d per night. The Committee is indebted to the Middlesex County Council for a grant for the purpose of inaugurating this service. 33 Holiday Scheme. In May 1953 a party of 110 old people were able to spend a week s holiday at Cliftonville at reduced rates. It was possible on this occasion to accommodate them in two hotels, instead of, as in previous years, two or three here and there All arrangements, including travelling, were made by the Welfare Committee and financial assistance given where necessary. Christmas Dinners For the past two or three years lonely old people and bed-ridden people have been provided without charge with a Christmas dinner, some 120 of these were distributed on Christmas Eve. Over Sixties club. This Club meets every Monday afternoon and its membership increased during the year by 20 to a figure of 188. Its numerous activities have continued throughout the year Non-Residential Club. It was not found possible to proceed during the year with the acquisition of premises for this purpose, but as a result of recent developments- however, it is hoped that suitable accommodation would be placed at the Committee s disposal to enable such a Club to be opened and provide permanent office accommodation in the near future. 34 VISITS, ETC FROM 1ST APRIL, 1953 TO 31ST MARCH, 1954. Old people who called at the office for advice 700 Visits made from the Office to ill or home-bound people 251 Visits made by other Lady Visitors 698 Old people helped to find accommodation 11 Old people helped to find part employment 28 Help given in arranging for holidays and convalescence 10 1,698 Cases under care from 31st March, 1953 66 New cases 1st April, 1953, to 31st March, 1954 88 Cases sent in by:- Welfare Officer 7 Hospitals 26 Local Authorities 19 Brought to our notice (other than above) 36 88 Districts:- Edgware 189 Mill Hill 200 Burnt Oak 148 West Hendon and Colindale 340 Hendon Central 412 Childs Hill 189 Garden Suburb 45 Golders Green 175 1,698 The office of the Committee is situated in the Methodist Church Hall (Room 3) The Burroughs, Hendon, N W.4, Telephone: HENdon 0404, and is open Mondays , Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays to deal with any enquiry relating to old people and for interviews. 35 SECTION D SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. WATER SUPPLY. The Borough has a dual source of supply. The Northern part is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the Central and Southern portion by the Metropolitan Water Board. The boundary between the two areas is formed by the Borough Boundary at the Welsh Harp Reservoir , Pollard Road, West Hendon Broadway, Station Road Hendon, to Hendon Station, British Railways (Midland Region) Line to junction of Eastern Region Line, British Railways Eastern Region (formerly L.N.E.R.) Line to Borough Boundary with Finchley. The Colne Valley water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk and before distribution to the consumers the water is under constant supervision of a chemical and bacteriological staff which carries out examinations in modern laboratories situated at the works. The water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board is selected Thames water which has been subjected to purification by storage in which time it is freed of the bulk of organisms It is filtered through rapid and then slow filters, attaining a degree of purity which compares favourably with the general supplies in Great Britain, but as a further safe-guard terminal chlorination is applied which ensures a first-class water in every respect. Samples of water are examined bacteriologically, chemically and for taste and other special purposes on every working day. The supply to all areas was satisfactory in quality and quantity. 36 Number of dwelling houses supplied from Public Water Mains:- (a) direct to houses 42,722 (b) by means of stand-pipes — Number of the population supplied from Public Water Mains:- (a) direct to houses 155,500 (b) by means of stand-pipes — HOUSING. I am indebted to the Housing Officer for the following observations and statistics relevant to the housing situation in the Borough during the year under reviews:- "The progress made in the provision of accommodation for inadequately housed families has been maintained, and during the year under review a total of 281 families were rehoused in Council dwellings,, an increase over the previous year's total. The number of Council dwellings now amounts to 3.038 of which 1,751 have been erected in post-war years Despite this satisfactory progress, however, there are still over 5,000 families registered as in need of alternative accommodations and a steady receipt of new applications is maintained. Allocation of houses and flats to Hendon families continues in the new and expanding towns. Some six towns are now active in receiving applicants who have secured local employment and it is hoped this number will increase as the development of other towns progresses. 37 It must not be overlooked that, due to the small amount of land left available in the Borough and which is suitable for development for Council dwellings, the end of the Council's building programme is now in sight. Within the course of the next few years all such land will be developed and it is apparent that the majority of housing applicants cannot be rehoused within the Boroughs. In these circumstances the importance of the contribution which new towns can make towards the lessening of the housing problem in Hendon must not be overlooked. The policy of transferring to smaller accommodation those Council tenants who were living in accommodation in excess of their requirements has been continued during the past year. By so doing it has been possible to make the larger types of houses available for re-letting to bigger families and so relieve the overcrowding formerly experienced in such cases. The demand from evicted families remains acute and although 29 such families were offered emergency accommodation in Half-Way Houses in the course of the year, in many cases it was impossible to assist. A feature of the year's work has been the commencement of the Lawrence Street Housing Scheme whereby a number of applicants able to assist themselves by private building have been nominated by the Council for houses to be built under this Scheme. It is anticipated the completion of this Scheme will result in the satisfying of the housing needs of many applicants on the waiting list. The following table sets out the number of housing applicants assisted during the year ending 31st December,,, 1953:- (1) Number of families rehoused in permanent accommodation:- (a) Pre-war Houses 39 (b) Post-war Houses 238 (c) Temporary Bungalows 4 281 38 (2) Transfers arranged to relieve overcrowding on Council Estates 155 (3) Number of families rehoused in requisitioned property 30 (4) Number of families given emergency accommodation in Half-way houses 29°" SANITARY INSPECTION The following summary of the inspection work, together with a report on the various duties performed by the Sanitary Inspectors, has been submitted to me by Mr0 A0 Ho Smith, Chief Sanitary Inspector0 During the year under review inspections were carried out as set out belows- Inspections made 6,762 Re-inspections after order or notice 10,353 Complaints received and investigated 1,470 Bakehouses 78 Butchers Shops 362 Caravans 90 Dairies 84 Drain Tests 151 Factories 240 Hawkers and Food Delivery Vans) Hawkers Storage Premises and Stalls) 120 Ice Cream Samples 103 Ice Cream Premises 50 Infectious Disease 584 Licensed Premises 110 Milk Samples 273 Other Food Shops 987 Overcrowding 71 Outworkers 17 Piggeries 32 Public Entertainment in connection with Licensing 101 Restaurants, Cafes etc0 146 Smoke Observations 229 Stables 1 Swimming Baths 9 Pet Animals Act 1951 16 Hairdressers 37 39 Notices Served.

Food and Food Premises. 1,937 Inspections were made of premises where food intended for sale for human consumption is prepared} stored or sold. Particular attention has been paid to the implementation of the Clean Food Bye-laws in respect of the proper, screening of foodstuffs to prevent contamination. It was not found necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce compliance although in two cases it was necessary to serve formal notice of infringements of the Bye-laws. During the period under review legal proceedings were taken in two cases in connection with unsound food and infringements under Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Convictions were obtained in both cases and the defendants fined. Attention has also been given to Hawkers of Food, particularly in connection with their vehicles and storage premises which are required to be registered with the Local Authority under the Middlesex County Council Act 1950. No clean food campaign was instituted during the year, it being considered that better results could be obtained by the sanitary inspectors concentrating their efforts on the inspection of food premises and meeting food traders and food handlers at their actual place of work. During the year a talk on the Food and Drugs Act was given by one of the sanitary inspectors to a class of students taking a course in catering. Action taken in connection with Food Stores and Food Shops. 107 notices were served on occupiers of shops and stores for infringements of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, where proper precautions were not being taken against contamination of food. At the end of the year 105 notices had been complied with. 48 The principal matters dealt with were:Sanitary Accommodations Defective sanitary conveniences 6 Defects in drainage systems 4 Choked drains 4 Compartments cleansed 25 Provision of Washing Facilities; Provision of hot water supply 12 Refrigerators: Interiors cleansed 5 Generals Insufficient accommodation for storage of refuse 4 Want of cleanliness 39 Other defects 155 Number and Type of Pood Premises in the Areas Grocers and Provision Merchants 222 Butchers 93 Bakers and Confectioners 49 Greengrocers 94 Fishmongers 37 Dairies and Milkshops 12 Confectionery Shops 91 Restaurants and Cafes 138 Butter Blending Factory 1 Works Canteens 45 Food Warehouses 2 Food and Drugs Act 1938 - Section 14.

(Sampling) The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the Borough of Hendon and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department for the following report on the work of his Department during the year. The total number of samples taken in the Borough of Hendon in 1953 was 570. Of these samples 9 were found to be irregular and were made up as follows:- Two samples of sausages procured from one vendor were sold containing the preservative sulphur dioxide without its presence being declared An official caution was given. Two samples of "smoked haddock" from different fishmongers were respectively smoked cod and smoked whiting. In the first instance a prosecution was launched but the case was dismissed, and in the second Instance a caution was issued. Two samples were of hot milk from one vendor which contained a very small proportion of added water The condition of the samples was brought to the notice of the seller and no further action was taken. A sample of pre-packed caviarre contained prohibited preservative and an official caution was issued to the importers. 53 A sample of "chocolate liqueurs" was found to be in fact non-alcoholic imitation liqueur chocolates and a caution was sent to the manufacturers The last sample was in respect of the sale of "roll and butter" the "butter" content of which was a mixture of margarine and butter. The seller, a cafe proprietor, received an official caution. In addition further duties as the Food and Drugs Authority were under taken by the Middlesex County Council within the Borough during the year, under the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953, and the Imported Food Orders Three hundred inspections were made as to the marking of origin of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruits, eggs and honey, and 1,376 stacks or articles examined A firm was fined £1 with £2. 2. 0. costs for exposing for sale imported poultry not marked with an indication of origin; another firm was fined £2 with £2. 2. 0. costs on a similar offence regarding imported apples; and a third firm was fined £4 with £2 2 0 costs for falsely labelling foreign lamb as "New Zealand". Under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, the premises of a dealer/processor of pasteurised milk in the Hendon area were regularly inspected and 52 samples of the pasteurised milk were submitted to examination and found correct. Slaughterhouses. There are no slaughterhouses in the district licensed by the Ministry of Food. Printed and Produced by Hendon Borough Council. 54 1 1 1 1
