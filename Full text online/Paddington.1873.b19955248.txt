Paddington. 3057 METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OP THE VESTRY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1874. Paddington. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF THE VESTRY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1874. £B YP The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; Its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board its returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (August excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow; viz.:— Ward one. All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 2 ward two. All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1, and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite the West end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the Centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. ward three. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South of Ward No. 1, and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. ward four. All that portion of the said Parish which is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Boro' of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 14 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Luke's, „ John s, „ Saviour's, „ Mary's, „ Michael and All Angels, Holy Trinity, Christ Church, St. Paul s, St. Mary Magdalene, All Saints', „ Peter's, St. Matthew's, „ Stephen's. 3 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road, near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Stainea, Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George, Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board Meeting at the Vestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Vestry, and the Baths were opened in May, 1874, in the Queen's Road, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by the Imperial Gas Light Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.:— the Grand Junction Water Works Company and the West Middlesex Water Works Company. The population, as shewn by the Census taken in 1871, is as under, viz.:— Ward No. 1 21,793 „ „ 2 41,029 „ „ 3 18,469 „ „ 4 15,522 Making a total of 96,813 The number of inhabited houses being 11,874. 4 The Rates levied since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act to the end of the year 1873, are as under, viz.:— S. d. £ For the year 1856 2 1 Based upon a rateable value of 522,570 1857 2 6 „ 538,879 1858 2 4 „ 582,995 1859 2 7 „ 605,382 1860 3 0 „ 625,479 1861 2 8 „ 643,063 1862 2 8 „ 617,840 1863 2 8½ „ 646,256 1864 3 0 „ 663,172 1865 3 0 „ 685,434 1866 3 2 „ 704,714 1867 3 6 „ 729,838 1868 3 5½ „ 740,686 1869 3 9 „ 759,158 1870 4 0 „ 773,524 Under the Provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. 1871 3 4 „ 954,868 1872 3 1½ „ 968,340 1873 3 7 „ 987,741 There are certain Charities under the control of the Vestry, managed by Trustees appointed by the Vestry and the Charity Commissioners, and having an annual income of more than Fifteen Hundred Pounds, which is annually distributed to the Poor in Coals and Blankets, in Grants to the Parochial National Schools, in apprenticing sons and daughters of poor parishioners, and in Annuities to aged persons resident in the Parish, &c.

Vestry Hall; July 6, 1874. Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting you my Seventh Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the Parish. I beg to invite your attention to some matters of interest falling within the routine of my duty as your Officer of Health—matters which, I trust, afford lessons either for administrative purposes or suggestive for future action. I have put upon record (l) the annual and quarterly statistics of births and deaths, (2) of the zymotic disease, (3) of deaths in early life, and (4) of those from tubercular forms of disease. Future reference to these Tables will furnish data when, hereafter, more extended researches are called for to check the ravages of preventible disease among the population, and for averting the high mortality that takes place amongst young children. 4 TABLE I. The following Table shows the number of Births and Deaths, and the Birth-rate and Death-rate, in each of the last 4 Quarters, and for the whole year. Quarter ending Births. Deaths.

A death-rate to the population of 19.27, compared with other places in England having 25 to 39 per 1,000, looks well in the face of returns taken from the whole registration district. The mortality, however, has considerable variations in different streets and classes of population. Amongst the squares and mansions it often ranges as low as 10 and 12 annually per 1,000 of the population, whilst in the crowded streets of the North and South Wharf Road district, the Hall Park district, and in the very highly populated streets of the Harrow Road, near the Lock Bridge, where every house is let in tenements to more than one family, and frequently one family in every room, the annual mortality reaches to 30 per 1,000 of the population, and upwards. The low mortality in the first-mentioned class of houses is explained by the fact that the domestic servants, contributing nearly 40 per cent, of the population in these streets 5 and squares, as a rule, in sickness go away to be cared for, and fatal cases, when they occur, are registered elsewhere. On the other hand, the high mortality in the last-mentioned streets scarcely represents the true death-rate going on in this class of street, for a large proportion of adults die in hospitals or a workhouse infirmary, and are not counted as deaths in the street or district in which they had lived, although they have been counted as units of the population at the time of taking the census. I have estimated that not less than 15 per cent, may be fairly added to the number of deaths that get registered in some of the streets, where the residents are very poor, and when being overtaken by sickness are compelled to resort to the hospital or workhouse a short time previous to death.

There is too great apathy displayed by a large section of the community for checking these common, but virulent, fever poisons (especially by parents, in not taking more caution against) measles, whooping cough, scarlet fever, &c., &c. It is a subject for grave reflection, as to whether sanitary authorities shall not better enforce the performance of parental duty in these respects. And the time is at hand when all patients suffering from contagious malady, will under certain conditions dangerous to others, have to be removed by more stringent measures than we now possess. The extreme indifference displayed with regard to these diseases by many of the lower and middle class is an unmistakable sign of an ignorant belief that they are natural events ; and such a belief leads to a carelessness of management much to be condemned. This indifference to stop disease at the centres of infection, tends to keep up, as well as to increase the severity of all epidemics. The working classes 'generally, visit freely during sickness, allowing their clothing to become saturated with contagious poison; and where isolation is ineffective, and children go to school, it affords means of spreading measles, whooping cough, and scarlet fever infection. It will be seen that out of the 85 cases of diarrhoea, 70 occurred in the summer quarter, and 64 were in young children mostly under one year of age. 7 Small Pox was only fatal in 2 cases, and scarlet fever in 8; Diptheria in 17 cases, including some, doubtful ones, often confounded with croup and simple tonsilitis. In the Fever cases there are many complicating causes of death. TABLE III.

In comparison with the metropolis and other large towns it is much below the average, and looks highly favourable to this parish. But if we take streets or groups of streets in districts and try them separately, different results will appear. The census of 1871 does not give the number of children in any street, or groups of streets or districts, it 8 merely shows the number of children under five in the registration district of Kensington, Paddington being included as a sub-district. I, however, took the precaution to get at the composition of several streets from the enumerators’ books, placed for a short time at my disposal by Captain Clode, the Secretary of the Census Office, for without these data, and without comparing the prevalence of disease and death in different places and under different social conditions, statistics would be very fallacious. In taking 15 streets, typical of the ordinary condition of the dwellings in which the working class reside, I find the annual proportion of deaths under five, ranges from 41 to 75 per cent, of the total deaths, and from 9 to 23 per 1,000 of the population in most of the said streets. The death-rate from all causes, and at all ages, it may be mentioned, in 18 very thickly-populated streets of the same character as now referred to, has been estimated many times during the last ten years, and is found to vary from 21.7 to 50 per 1,000. A. very high proportion of these deaths are children under one year, for many die within six months of birth. It must be remembered that the working class are much more prolific than the middle and higher class, the proportion of young children to the general population, according to the census, revealed the fact that only per 100 persons living in the squares and mansions were under 5 years, whereas 17 to 20 per cent, were under five in the streets and houses let out in tenements. It was further ascertained that among the aristocracy double the proportion of persons were living at the age of 60 and upwards. 9 TABLE IV.

In this Parish every year, the cases exceed in number those of the zymotic class, vide Table V. The 358 deaths, or 18 per cent. of the whole, is a formidable proportion. The 206 deaths from consumption, at ages between 20 and 60, (most of them between 30 and 50), or one in every 500 persons of the population, shows that there exists some general cause, silently working great mischief, and undermining the constitution of parents at a period of life in health and strength when they can least be spared from their families. The result of inquiry into poor law practice shows that consumption brings many widows and children upon the rates. This is not however the worst evil, for we know that the qualities of the parents descend upon the children "unto the third and fourth generation." The tendency may remain dormant under favourable B 10 conditions of life, but it is to be feared that a large majority of those pre-disposed will not be in a position to command all, or any great share of those sanitary comforts necessary to protect themselves or their offspring against the development of a tubercular diathesis. The death-rate of the consumptive class is much greater in some districts than others. Happily, it has removable causes, just as have fevers, cholera, and other zymotics, which science and sanitary regulations are well able to avert as soon as society desires to concern itself seriously about such matters. Mr. Simon's admirable investigations have already prepared the way. The drying of the soil has led to a remarkable diminution of phthisis death-rate in 15 towns, varying from 11 to 49 per cent, of its previous rate.— Privy Council Report, of 1867. TABLE V.

The population increased during the 10 years before the census of 1871, on the average of 2,500 annually, and there is every reason to believe the same rate is going on, for nearly the same number of new houses are built every year, about 250, and an immigration takes place from other parts of the metropolis to the newly-built streets in this parish. The excess of 800 births above the deaths, will not alone account for the large annual addition to the population. The death rate remains about stationary, fluctuating from 18 to 20 annually per 1,000 of the population, for reasons before explained, page 5, it is very low. The birth rate is from 27 to 30 per 1,000, or about the usual average. It is gratifying to find the zymotic or epidemic forms of diseases rather diminish than otherwise, both in amount and in proportion. Since 1868, although more than 18,000 persons have been added to the population, there is no increase under this head. I am however inclined to believe tubercular deaths are slightly tending to increase. The number of deaths of young children remain nearly stationary. Looking at the deaths at ages between 20 and 60, it appears that in 1868 and 1869, they were 53 and 63 in every 10,000, and rose up to 73 in 1874. The number of deaths in aged persons, 80 and upwards, seems also to increase. The general result is, that sanitary measures keep down deaths from preventible causes, whilst more life is preserved, more deaths occur from natural causes, and at later period of life. 12 Vaccination in the Parish of Paddington. The two Public Vaccinators, Dr. Lyle and Dr. Hibbert, have both been awarded gratuities, under the Privy Council authority, amounting to about £16 each, for the superior manner in which the Public Vaccination has been done in their respects c Districts.

During the last year this most useful department of sanitary organization has been conducted by C. J. Biorn, and embraced all the streets, houses, and courts of the parish, inhabited chiefly by working people, comprising a population of about 29,351 persons in 2,515 houses, 17,008 rooms, 2,802 families in single rooms. The sanitary defects are recorded in forms kept for the purpose. In order to get more accurate data concerning the state of the persons living in a certain class of street, I have grouped them into districts,* having a similarity of composition, and the records kept are under the following heads:— name of street, no. of house, no. of rooms, no. of adults, of children, cubic space in basement, ground floor, front and back kitchens, 1st floor, 2nd floor, attics, &c., and no. of persons in one room, when occupied by a single family. The Inspector notices all defects of cleanliness, dust receptacle, water supply, do. of water closets, drains and traps, paving of yards and wash-houses. The sanitary orders issued upon owners or occupiers, are reported to the Sanitary Committee at their fortnightly meetings. The effect * The following are well defined Districts, formed of groups of Streets having a similar composition:— North Wharf Road South Wharf Road, Amberley Road, Moscow Road, Hall Park Estate, and Kilburn Districts. Kensal New Town, Harrow Road Streets, right and left, Woodchester, Cirencester, and Clarendon Streets, and Streets leading out of Westbourne Terrace North. 14 of numerous sanitary orders from time to time, and works completed, have lessened many dangers and discomforts that would have threatened the health of the families of the working people, whilst landlords of houses let out in weekly holdings, become aware of the visits of the Sanitary Inspector, and not only attend to matters before hand, but express a willingness to remove any local causes of unhcalthiness that are pointed out to them. Many, if not all of these streets have, by means of inspection, undergone a very marked change with regard to the character of people who are living in them. Landlords get a better class of tenant in streets known to be kept in good sanitary order. There is none of that absolute squalid misery in any of them, such as might have been seen in Church Place, Dudley Street, North Wharf Road, &c., a few years back. Overcrowding cases are becoming more and more rare in all parts of the parish. The following Cases of Overcrowding have been discovered and abated during 1873:— White Lion Place . .4 adults and 2 children containing 1,100 cubic feet. Dirty people; went out on notice. Cuthbert Street 3 adults and 4 children in a top back room containing 786 feet. Went out within a few days. Church Place 2 adults and 6 children in back room containing 700 cubic feet, Dirty; went out of the Parish. „ 5 adults and 1 child in top back room taining 700 cubic feet. Went out on giving notice. 15 South Wharf Road Adults (Mother and 2 grown-up sons), and 4 children in a kitchen containing about 1,100 cubic feet. 41 Cirencester Street In the front kitchen a woman lived who kept 14 cats, the smell from which was intolerable. They were on the chairs, on the bed, on the table, in the fender; in fact, were Overcrowded by animals. everywhere. She was in receipt of Parish relief and refused to get rid of them. The Inspector, after a great deal of trouble, caused her to give up keeping them, and had the kitchen cleaned. The difficulty is in knowing what to do with overcrowding cases, for it happens that these unfortunate people are compelled to remove to distant houses situated out of the Parish, where they are not so strictly looked after, and where no systematic Sanitary work goes on to detect and prevent the evil recurring in a worse form. What however will much add to the value of the work of sanitary inspection, is a more prompt knowledge of the seat and origin of infectious disease. The books of the Medical Officers of the Union are searched weekly for such cases, and the Relieving Officers are invited to give information of cases of infectious disease, and any local causes of sickness, but the information is only partial, and of little value in comparison with much that might be done in controlling and arresting epidemic diseases by a Registration of Sickness. Periodical returns of sickness have long been called for by Officers of Health. This would prove even more beneficial to the public than death returns of the 16 Registrar-General. These returns should be obtained at any reasonable cost. It is a sine qua non that Zymotic Disease, whether amongst the poor in hospitals or dispensaries, or children in schools, and all this class of cases in private practice, should be made known at once to the Sanitary authority, and not, as now, only after a death has occurred. Social interests demands this information; and every one who has a family, exposed as it is to the danger of these diseases arising from the neglect of others, has a right to a protective benefit, which sanitary laws are intended to confer. This protection would be more perfect if we had but a complete record of the seat and original outbreak of all dangerous contagious diseases. Sanitary Charts. AVhat we much need are sanitary charts of each of these districts, on the Ordnance scale, showing the sewers, gulleys, open spaces, gardens and trees. Each death should be marked by a colored spot or black dot. In a more advanced sanitary administration, when we get a register of disease (as we probably soon shall have, of the Zymotic Disease, at least, as well as of deaths), it will be useful to spot the Zymotics as they occur, blue, red, green, indicating fever, scarlatina, measles, typhoid, &c. Thus, at the end of the year, and for years in succession, they may be inspected by those interested in the sanitary state of the street, town, or district. This would be useful to persons going to buy or sell houses, and would tend to sharpen up house-property men in sanitary matters. 17 The Canal Basin. The water in the Canal Basin was not run off this year at Whitsuntide, when the usual annual cleansing takes place. The Company have caused a considerable amount of mud to be removed by dredging during the winter, and, up to the present time, the water has been tolerably free from malarious exhalations. It generally begins to emit foul gas, generated from the mud at the bottom, when the temperature reaches about 70° F. The putrefactive fermentation of the water in hot weather begins sometimes on a sudden. The manure loading and deposits on the wharves have been much complained of lately, more especially the offensive smells from stable manure, which is kept too long in sunken pits before removal; when so offensive, it ought only to pass along public streets in covered carts, and on no account ought to be deposited on the wharf, but shot at once into barges. These should not remain in the basin over twelve hours; and as a rule this order is complied with. As a large trade of this kind must be carried on somewhere, it is desirable to have it under better control, in order that it may be conducted with as little nuisance as possible. It is a disgrace to sanitary law in the Metropolis that we are not in a better position to deal with this and other offensive trades and nuisances in a more summary manner than at present. All the efforts of the Vestry to control these trades and to prevent nuisances, and even avoid threatening dangers from the foul and stagnant water c 18 of the basin, appear to have been hitherto baffled by legal difficulties. The Directors of the Canal Company ought now that the Basin is in the centre of a populous Metropolitan district, and not as it was originally in the outskirts of London, make more efficient bye-laws for the manure loading, and, with regard to the stagnant water in the Pool, if permitted by the Metropolitan Board of Works, thousands of tons of water, could be let off into the sewers, at times when the Canal is plentifully supplied, which would, like storm water, wash and cleanse them. Rag, Bone, and Fat Collecting. A large number of shops, commonly known as Marine Stores, are found in back Streets and Mews of this Parish; they have for some years past been subject to the vigilant inspection of the Inspector of Nuisances, in consequence of complaints from neighbours of offensive smells arising from them, or from the removal of fat and bones. These offensive businesses should, like Slaughter-houses and other noxious trades, be under a permit or licence, and subject to bye-laws and periodical inspection. We manage to keep them in fair order, insisting upon the fat and bones being kept in covered receptacles and going away at frequent intervals. One nuisance connected with these shops is the noxious effluvia from the Soap-boilers and Bonecollector's waggons, which come round weekly and stand about in the street, emitting their sickening odour, much complained of by ladies and persons going shopping. 19 In any future Bye-law regulating this traffic, covered vans should be insisted upon; and in some neighbourhoods, early hours in the morning should be fixed, before shops open, for the removal of all offensive matters. Inspection of Bake-houses. The whole of the bake-houses throughout the Parish, 81 in number, have been most carefully inspected by T. R. Clifford and myself, and 14 Sanitary orders were issued for cleansing, improved ventilation, and disinhabiting of rooms used as bed-rooms without sufficient light. Beyond what the Act, 26 & 27 Vict., Cap. 40, demands, we have not ventured to materially interfere, but it is obvious that more efficient Sanitary supervision will be needed sooner or later, such as inspection of the materials used in bread making, the quality of flour, of rice, potatoes, and yeast used,whether alum is found on the premises, the quality of water, and the atmosphere of bake-houses should also be noticed and duly reported upon. My own opinion is, that great reforms are needed, and I say this, not only upon personal observations of the trade, but follow Dr. Guy and others, who made inquiries into the subject some years since. The following are circumstances that call for changes, beneficial to the interests of masters and men. These trades should not be conducted in under-ground apartments (caves as the French would call them) where the atmosphere is unnecessarily hot, sometimes fetid and stifling. The men employed in under-ground bakeries are much below the standard of health—asthma, bronchitis, and 20 consumption are common after middle age, and the average age at death is very low. 1 hey suffer much unnecessary exposure to draught, changes of temperature, working as I observe they do, almost in a state of nudity in heated air, and then going home at unseasonable hours. The atmosphere of a bakehouse contains particles of flour, sulphurous acid, and carbonic acid, the latter escaping from the oven or fuel used in it. These more or less irritate the mucous membrane of the lungs when they once begin to suffer from a slight cough or catarrh. In the manufacture of such an important article of food as bread, persons engaged in it should not be permitted to work in a foul atmosphere. The ventilation in almost every instance is bad, and the air in the rooms where the work is carried on by gas-light is very different to what it would be in a room on the ground-floor, and open to day light, with good ventilation. The water supply cisterns are nearly all placed in close proximity to a contaminated atmosphere, either of the bake-house itself, or near to the w.c., or a bedroom on the same floor, where the bed-linen is not very clean, and where the men can easily come out halfdressed. The result is, that from a want of proper sanitary precautions, the men are kept in a sweaty state during the many hours they have to work. The last objection I would make to our modern bake-house regulations is, the repulsive method of bread and biscuit making by manual or pedal operations. % Patent Bread-making Machines have been long in use in large bakeries, and many public institutions, 21 and ought to supersede the rude hands and arms process in vogue so many centuries. The working journey-men bakers made an appeal to the public about a year since to support a reform movement for their trade. The daily papers at the time made some severe comments upon the present system of fabricating bread—there the matter rests. From the Daily News.— "In the middle of the nineteenth century, Dough-making is still a cruel labour! The closed knuckles must be violently thrust into a huge mass of tenacious dough, which must be raised by the muscular effort of the arms, and turned and tossed over repeatedly with the most violent exertion. The workman who performs this hard task has consequently received the too-expressive appellation of moaner (geindre), because the exhaustive nature of his toil is betrayed by the heavy stifled groans which are forced from his chest. Every part of his body is soon overflowing with perspiration, which falls in large drops, and is amalgamated with the dough he is kneading; and he is entirely overwhelmed with fatigue by the time he has reached the end of his killing labour." The Public Baths. The opening of the new Public Baths and Washhouses for use in this parish is a sanitary measure of no little importance, and meets with general approbation. I have in former Reports pleaded for public baths as a needful luxury for the artizan class engaged in dirty occupations, such as stokers, engine-drivers, smiths, stable-men, and others, and am pleased to find this great sanitary want has been supplied for them. It will not only largely contribute to the promotion of cleanliness of person and clothing, but will materially lessen the danger of spreading contagious diseases throughout the community. 22 Cow Sheds, Inspection of Dairies and the Milk Jrade, in connexion with Public Health. There are in this Parish 14 Cow-sheds under inspection, and about 170 cows for the supply of milk to families. The keeping of cows in sheds in the built up parts of London has undergone gradual improvements every successive year that licenses have been granted under 25 and 26 Vic., cap. 102. Many of these places are still in objectionable situations in this and in other Metropolitan Parishes. In our inspection nothing is done authoritatively beyond attention to drainage, water supply, and ventilation—that is, sufficient cubic space for each cow. But in the production of such a delicate article of food as milk, which is now well-known to become infected, and to be a vehicle capable of conveying disease, and is the cause of epidemics, an inspection of the health of cows themselves, their mode of feeding, and of the dairy where Milk is kept, is, in my opinion, an essential part of Sanitary policy protecting the interests of public health. Those who have read my Quarterly Reports on Food Adulteration, cannot fail to remark how much the general quality of milk has improved in this Parish since it has been subjected to the scrutiny of public analysis; but there are yet further efforts needed to bring up the Milk trade of the Metropolis to its perfect status. Milk Epidemics. The Milk Epidemic in Marylebone last August, extending into this and adjoining Parishes the outbreak of Milk Typhoid in Islington and other towns, 23 within the last few years, have now clearly proved the necessity of strict attention to the health of cows, and more scrupulous cleanliness in dairy management. I have long been convinced that many of the dairies of small Milk-dealers have rooms where Milk is received and kept a short time before its delivery to customers, which are in a very improper condition, and in situations bad, for such a susceptible fluid as Milk. I may mention some examples that have come under my own observation of the modes in which deleterious gases poison the air and pollute the Milk exposed to it; so well aware of this are the chief large Dairy-proprietors, and one in particular in this Parish, that they invite public attention of the system they adopt for the reception and delivery of Milk, and they employ a competent staff of officers to advise and report periodically upon all the matters that contribute to the perfection of dairy management. Three striking cases will suffice to show in detail some of the suspicious circumstances alluded to. I have seen Milk exposed for retail sale in a dirty shop where fowls entered from the street by a hole in the wall, their droppings were lying on the floor, and they laid their eggs in a nest under the counter on which Milk stood. The ceilings and walls were dirty throughout. In another instance, milk was kept in a small back parlor, used at night as a sleeping room, it smelt far from fresh and clean during my visit in the day-time, cases of small pox had occured in the same house a year back, while it was used as a milk depot. In the basement of premises in another case where milk was 24 kept, carbolic acid had been thrown down the drains, doubtless to destroy the sewer gas effluvia coming up; on the following day the milk was strongly tainted. The smell from mice, the musk-rat, fungoid vegetation, sewer gas from sinks and drains, and many other volatile matters, readily taint milk exposed to them even a short time, and speedily set up lactic fermentation, in which bacteria soon appear under microscopic examination. The fact that Milk thus changed in its character, will cause illness in both adults and children, has long been known to me, and shows to my mind the reasonableness of more rigid supervision over this branch of industry in large cities. In former Reports on private slaughter houses, I alluded to the dangerous facilities offered through them for the removal to, and killing therein of cows that have become unfit for milk, and not less unfit for human food. Some are positively suffering from disease, as the state of internal organs have shown, yet the flesh has been sold to the public as sound and wholesome food. The history of cows brought to slaughter houses should always be inquired into, and the carcase, if not inspected during life by proper officials, should be inspected after it is killed, and it should be reported to them whether the beast was driven or carted to the slaughter house. At present dairymen and slaughterers of cattle have the transaction all their own way, for no public officers have much cognizance of what takes place. 25 Flushing and Ventilation of Sewers. During the last two years, both the Sanitary and Public Health Committee and the Highway Committee have had Reports upon this subject from the Surveyor and from myself, but the matter is still under their consideration. A large amount of work has been done by the latter authority. Besides the cleansing and ventilation of foul Sewers that have been complained of from time to time by myself, or inhabitants living in their vicinity, a large number of new gullies properly trapped, and furnished with catch pits, have been substituted for old and imperfect ones. Additional ventilating grids have been placed in the middle of the roads, and men have been employed in removal of sand and grit, from sewers where it caused obstructions to the flow of sewage, and consequently generated foul odours. Sewers have also been flushed by water, where the current is found to be sluggish, either from scanty rainfall, or other causes. Although I am of opinion that by careful attention to the flushing and ventilation of sewers where they are foul, obstructed, ill-constructed and defective, will do much to obviate dangers from sewer gas, I am satisfied that a practical solution of the difficulty in managing town sewers has not yet been arrived at. Street grids are simple and effective in ventilating the sewers, not likely to get out of order, but without other precautions, not generally attended to, such as providing an amount of water enough to keep up a constant current in the stream below, they are only dangerous nuisances. The pestiferous vapor issuing from them at night or early D 26 morning, is readily detected, and practically speaking, the foul sewer is as dangerous as an open ditch, and quite as familiar in smell, as the nuisance of an unsewered town. It has been doubted whether sewer gases are dangerous to persons breathing them, and the Metropolitan Board of Works once collected evidence, which appeared to them to prove freedom from danger to the men employed on their works; but no one at the present day doubts that there is generally, or may be at times a compound, capable of producing sickness, or under some conditions bring absolute pestilence amongst us. I have evidence of this malaria affecting the health of delicate and susceptible constitutions of persons living in mansions contiguous to foul gullies, and have known the damp air in the evening when charged with this miasmatic poison to produce vomiting whilst walking past, and breathing it only a few seconds. I, therefore, as your officer of health, insist upon the removal, if possible, of these under-ground nuisances, and it is for that reason that I have endeavoured to inform myself upon everything that relates to their nature and causes, and even investigated them by personal examinations. The result of my inquiries is embodied in three reports, containing suggestions and recommendations, all tending to strengthen the hands of the Surveyor, and those who have the control of the sewers, and are responsible for the removal of the nuisances connected therewith. The question to determine is, either to prevent the gas and smells from water-closet sewage from being 27 generated at all, or how to get rid of them when once they are formed. Charcoal ventilators have been pronounced by most observers to be successful only in exceptional instances, and it is only with special attention they can be used for the deodorization of the sewers, or for disinfecting on any permanent or extensive scale. Street ventilation or open grids have the objection just pointed out, in giving out noxious smells, and are too much at the mercy of changing winds and currents of air, and have no regulated action. Flushing therefore, when thoroughly understood, supersedes all other operations. It will keep the temperature of the air, and of the liquid matters of the sewers at a low temperature, and so materially check decomposition and putrefaction, in fact, it is extremely doubtful whether a temperature 45° to 50° will permit of any smell or decomposition sufficient for creating gases to any extent appreciable outside. The temperature of air in sewers at present is often as high as 70°, and becomes in proportion favorable for putrefaction and diffusing vapours. After all that can be said, and experiments tried, I venture to predict that water is the only agent, that in sufficient quantity, and at all times, can be used as a deodorizer for sewage, while as a motive power it is the cheapest means for carrying it away, and especially of matters, that if permitted to lodge, create the nuisances complained of. It is an affair of engineering detail to show how cold water shall be properly and so usefully employed. 28 Sanitary Legislation in 1874. The Parliamentary Session of 1874 has been rich in measures of sanitary import. Much has been accomplished, and more stands over for next Session. The following Acts passed into law:— 1.— Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, to amend and extend the Public Health Act of 1872, contains 59 clauses, (many referring to the Metropolis,) giving increased powers to the sanitary authority in making Bye-Laws, to be confirmed by the Local Government Board. 2.— The Registration Act Amendment is intended to remedy defects in the registration of births and deaths. A good registration act materially affects the sanitary administration of the Country, which is now rendered more essential since the Public Health Act of 1872 created officers of health, whose duties will be aided by more complete records. The Statistical Society, and the Standing Public Health Committee of the Social Science Association, reviewed this Bill, and made several important recommendations. It was thought that a period of 42 days is too long to elapse for an informant to give notice after a birth, and also with regard to a death, the proposal to allow a maximum of one month to complete the registration they believed to seriously frustrate the collection of returns for sanitary statistics. There has in this country never been any proper safe-guard against the burial of liveborn children as still-born; under the old law stillborn children could be buried without the knowledge 29 of the Registrar, in the present Bill, clause 18 and 19 deal effectually with this; in a former Bill it was proposed that no still-born should be buried without an order, and that particulars of every case should be entered in a separate book. The certification of the causes of death being now obligatory upon the medical men, it would have been only fair that they should be entitled legally to make a charge for such certificates as for other medical services. Clause 28 provides for returns of deaths required by sanitary authority (only those acting under the Public Health Acts) and entitles the registrar to a fee for deaths entered upon the form furnished. 3.— The Slaughter-houses Act is intended to deal and regulate Slaughter-houses, and certain other businesses more or less associated therewith. Blood-boiler, bone-boiling, tripe-boiling, manure-manufacturing, soapboiler, tallow-melters, and knackers and fel-mongers. It repeals the Sec. 55 and 56 of the Metropolis Building Act of 1855, which would have prevented these trades from becoming established in built-up parts of London. The local authority will in future, for the Metropolis, be the Metropolitan Board of Works, and in the City of London, the Commissioners of Sewers. They will make bye-laws, to be chiefly approved by the Local Government Board. Notice is however to be given to the Vestry of the Parish where the premises are situated, and any objection to the granting of the licence will then be heard, and taken into consideration. It appears that the local boards or parishes have very little power under this Act, and the opinions entertained by Medical Officers of Health are in no way 30 mentioned as having any weight in the granting of licences. Much will however depend upon the byelaws and regulations to be put into force by the Metropolitan Board of Works. 4.— The amended Alkali Act extends the power of inspector and sub-inspectors, under the Alkali Act, with respect to noxious gases, other than muriatic acid, viz.:— sulphuric acid, sulphurous acid (other than from the combustion of coals) nitric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen and chlorine; and for this provision is made (in addition to using the best practical means for rendering all these gases harmless) that every alkali work shall secure the condensation of muriatic acid to such an extent that each cubic foot of air shall not contain more than one-fifth part of a grain of muriatic acid. Analysis of Air and Water. The principle here acknowledged in relation to sanitary inspection is very important. The examination and analysis of air and water, polluted or made unwholesome by any cause, lies at the root of evils which have never yet been properly dealt with by statutary authority. Analysis of air, like water analysis, must sooner or later be relied upon, and its chemical and microscopical examination put forward as a crucial test for dangers arising from bad ventilation of rooms, sewers, and work-shops, and for demonstrating other sources of mischief, having their origin from the foul atmosphere in and about dwellings, or in towns with a high density of population. 31 5.— The Factories Act 1874 (Health of Women, &c.) is a sanitary act of immense value, dealing as it proposes, with the health and employment of women the refreshment hours, and education of children. This Bill was strongly opposed, many women believing it to be a legislative fetter upon their right to labour, and believing that they could make their own bargains with employers just as well as men. Women are certainly not allowed to judge for themselves in this instance, and the grounds upon which Parliament judged this politic, was based upon the sanitary aspect of the question, in the Report of Dr. Bridges and T. Holmes— to the Local Government Board on the proposed changes in the hours and ages of persons employed in Textile Fabrics. 6.— The Working Men's Dwelling Act, although only applicable to Municipal Corporations, and does not unfortunately touch the Metropolis where it is most needed, affords increased facility for the acquisition of sites for dwelling houses suitable for persons engaged in manual labor. A Corporation can purchase lands, grant leases of lands, make roads, drains, fences. The Metropolitan Buildings Management Bill, although prepared by the authority of the Metropolitan Board of Works with much care, and referred to a Select Committee, did not meet with enough support to carry it through. There were in it several clauses and bye-laws guarding against sanitary evils admitted by officers of health. These related to the better preparation of the foundation in the basements of new houses by layers of concrete, a damp proof course with dry areas, adequate light, cubic space, and ventilation. 32 These were insisted upon by the promoters of the Bill. When however this measure again comes forward, or when any other Building Bill is proposed, which might as well apply to the country at large, as to London in particular, I hope a clause will not be forgotten that all buildings, public or private, shall be reported upon by the officers of health of the district, as well as the Surveyor, who shall specially examine the drainage, water supply, means of ventilation, removal of refuse, smoke, fire escape, &c., before such buildings be inhabited, or used by the public. Another Bill was prepared, with extensive powers to be entrusted to a Public Commission for providing a Constant water supply, with pressure for the extinction of fires in the Metropolis. The Commission was to borrow an enormous capital to buy up the eight Water Companies, now supplying the Metropolis. It was to carry out the provisions of the Metropolis Water Act of 1852, and that of 1871, to provide hydrants and apparatus for high pressure in case of fire ; to fix apparatus for cleansing and watering the streets, or for any other sanitary purposes. The Bill did not proceed to a second reading, and doubtless requires more time and attention to mature the details, before it can pass into law. We may look forward to some Act of this kind as a necessary adjunct for securing more uniformity of action, greater economy of water supply (perhaps also for gas) when the time comes for a re-construction of the government of London. The Select Committee upon the adulteration of Food has done good service by its inquiry into the working of the Act of 1872. 33 The character and scope of legislation which the Committee on explosive substances recommended, has regard to dangers that have long threatened the public safety. The illegal storage and manufacture of fireworks and explosive substances, is now a continual source of accidents and deaths. A new and comprehensive Act, repealing existing ones, has been framed to protect the public and work-people. It will in all probability pass next session. In addition to the Bills prepared, and Acts passed, theVaccination laws have been strengthened by a short amendment, the Infant Life Protection Act has been amended, and a standing order has passed in the House of Commons that Railway Bills, and other improvements, or demolitions, affecting the dwellings of working people, shall show in what way they propose to substitute other dwellings in lieu of the old ones. Sanitary Missionaries or Nurses. r I would briefly call attention to another step taken during the past year, indicative of the sanitary progress of the age. The Members of the Order of St. John have formed a National Association for providing trained nurses for the sick-poor in London and in the Provinces. This Association has already received the co-operation and support of ladies and gentlemen interested in the diffusion of sanitary knowledge and appliances. The presence of persons of intelligence, conversant with the wants of the sick-poor, has been alluded to in one of my early reports, 1868 - 69, page 15, wherein I expressed my belief that beneficial and unexpected results would in all probability follow the employment of sanitary missionaries, men or women, E 34 whose services could supplement the efforts of the medical officers and the clergy, in visiting the homes and haunts of the poor, the sick and needy, as well as the unthrifty and dissipated, urging them by kindly advice to give personal attention to matters relating to unhealthy lodgings, vicious social habits, negligence in cooking, and other domestic influences belonging to the prevention as well as treatment of disease. This has long been felt to be a desideratum by those best conversant with the operations of our out-door poor law administration. Open Spaces and Vacant Building Ground. In the North-West part of the Parish, not less than 200 acres of fields are still open for building speculations. Ground if not properly prepared for building purposes, is often a dangerous nuisance, it gives out organic eflluvia for many years, where it is made up by "slop-shoots," street-refuse, and "hard-core." In the new Building Bill for the Metropolis, and in the Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, this is to be provided for by suitable clauses, regulating the sub-soil drainage, and the adoption of other precautions. Open space for air and recreation is much wanted for the dense population in the streets of the Harrow Road District. A recreation ground will be called for when it is too late to secure sufficient space to be useful.* A few acres of the fields might possibly now be got within a reasonable distance and at a reasonable price. The Vestry should have power to prevent this dense congregation of human beings, • Since writing this Report, a new workman's city, to be called the "Queen's Park," is proposed for 80 acres situated in this District. 35 without proper air-space, and play-grounds in proportion to the young population. It is a sad thing to see multitudes of young children at play in Woodchester, Cirencester, and Clarendon Streets, where they get no healthy sport, many of them are seen sitting on the kerbstone, breathing over gully gratings for half an hour at a time. In all crowded neighbourhoods landowners should be compelled, under an efficient Building Act, to set apart, or reserve under fixed certain conditions, open spaces, to be planted with trees, if only as a sanitary necessity for young children. If now they were provided, and judiciously managed by municipal authority out of rates, these open spaces might not prove a burden. A cricket ground, with a gymnasium for athletic sports would yield an income; bands of music, volunteer drill, and flower-shows would be attractions tending to improve the value of property. Building-ground should never be allowed to be laid out without an open space of some kind. It will be wanted some day in these crowded neighbourhoods to place a temporary tent hospital, to treat fever as only fever and other epidemics can be properly treated, under canvas, (easily warmed and safe), in all kinds of weather. London, generally, is singularly destitute of open spaces. "Why is it," asks Charles Kingsley, "that there are not covered places where people can take refuge from a shower of rain ?" He also asks very pertinently, "Are not many persons drawn to the public-house for want of suitable places for rest ? " 36 Sanitary Value of Trees. A good-sized tree— for instance, the plane, elm, or lime, has been estimated to produce 7,000,000 leaves, having a surface of 200,000 square feet, or five acres of surface. The influence of such an absorbtion and exhalation going on in the process of vegetable digestion and nutrition should not be lost sight of as a sanitary agency for large cities. In summer, animal and vegetable putrefaction impregnates the atmosphere with deleterious compounds. Animal life is only kept active and healthy by getting rid of its excretions and secretions. Carbonic acid, a deadly poison given off by the lungs, shows its effects if retained for a few minutes. This poison, together with the ammoniacal organic products of man and animal, would soon render the air pestiferous and incapable of respiration did they not become quickly separated and retained by the green leaves and shoots of trees, and fixed in their substance. At the same time vegetation is thus destroying and using up the malaria it is giving out into the atmosphere the life-renewing element "pure oxygen" for the respiration of man and animals. These facts are too much ignored; but they are not the only ones I would venture to notice. Vegetation and trees with their copious foliage tend to cool the atmosphere in hot weather. Trees, like animals, have the power of maintaining a mean temperature in winter and summer, and the air in contact with the foliage in summer is much cooler than the surrounding atmosphere in situations where there are none. This influence, which depends upon the 37 lation of watery vapour from the leaves, is quite independent of the shade they afford from the direct rays of the sun. Shade is most grateful and salutary in populous towns where the pavements become so excessively hot; the radiation from them often affects the eye-sight as well as the health of those who are compelled to expose themselves for long periods to the reflected rays of the sun upon stones and other smooth surfaces unprotected by shade. There should be at least one tree for every citizen in the built-up parts of our large towns, and their control and cultivation should be under a qualified authority, the one charged with the care of streets and public places. The Mortuary or Dead-house. There have been 111 bodies brought to the deadhouse during the year 1873— 1874 (being 38 men, 30 women, 41 children, and 2 still-born), 22 of which have been brought by the police. Nine bodies have been taken from the canal, being two men, one woman, and six children. Five bodies were brought from the Great Western Railway; one case was a gentleman who shot himself in one of the closets; another was a gentleman who fell dead on the platform while waiting for a train ; another was a man who was killed by falling between the carriages and platform when the train was in motion; the other two were newly-born children found dead by the police. There have been 75 inquests held during the year, and 67 post-mortems made. 38 Inspector's Report of Sanitary Work completed during the Year ending March 27, 1874.

REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall ; 30th June, 1874. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this, my Annual Report on the principal Works executed, and the chief business transacted in this Department, during the year ended Lady-day, 1874. Paving. The Footway Pavements in the Streets requiring repair, have been taken up, re-laid, and made good with new flags, and otherwise maintained in good condition. About 270 lineal yards of footway in Harrow Road, hitherto repaired with Gravel, has been paved with new Yorkshire Flag Stones in lieu thereof. The old Carriageway Paving in Brook Mews North, Polygon Mews, Polygon Mews South, Charles 3 Mews, and Connaught Mews, has been taken up. The best Granite Stones were re-dressed and re-laid, and the old Rag Stones and Pebbles carted to the Parish Wharf for macadamizing purposes, and the deficiency was made good with new Granite Paving, which made a great improvement in the surface of the Roads in question. The Channel Paving in various Streets has been re-laid and kept in good repair, and many Water Channels and Crossings have been paved with the best description of Granite. Improvements. The Carriageway and Footpaths in Great Western Road and Kensal Road at their junction with the Carlton Bridge, have been raised and widened, and a thoroughfare formed and completed over the Bridge to Carlton Terrace. General Works. The closing of certain thoroughfares for carriage traffic, as sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works, during the repair of the Roads, and the continued use of our Steam Road Roller, have hastened the operations of the workmen and the consolidation of the metalling, to the manifest improvement of the roadways, and saving of animal power. Several new Streets and portions thereof have been paved by the Vestry, under the powers of "The Metropolis Management Acts," at the cost of Owners of Houses abutting on such Streets. 4 The length of additional Streets completed and taken to as Parish Roads, with the previous extent thereof, make a total of 41 miles, 7 furlongs, and 41 yards, under the control of the Vestry. The Gas and Water Companies and others have opened the Public Streets in 3,017 places for the purpose of laying and repairing pipes, and the costs of re-instating the Roadways and Footpaths have been paid to the Vestry. Lighting. Twenty-four Lamps were erected during the year, making a total of 1,699. The erection of additional Lamps, and alterations in the line of Footways, have rendered it necessary to remove 12 Lamps to new positions. The Imperial Gas Light Company's charges for supplying the Gas, Lighting and Extinguishing the Lamps, Painting and Maintaining the Posts and Lanterns, were during the four quarters, namely, June, 1873, at the rate of £4:8:0 each Lamp per annum — September and December, £4:18:0, and in March, 1874, £5:8:0. Buildings, Sewers, and Drains. Forty-eight Notices were received by the Vestry, in accordance with the 76th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, for the erection of 103 Buildings, namely—a temporary Church; Public Baths and Wash-houses; 3 School Buildings; 93 Houses; and 5 Stables. The orders of the Vestry for the drainage of such Buildings have been served upon the 5 parties concerned, and Copies thereof filed at the Vestry Hall. One hundred and twenty applications for the reconstruction and repair of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways to 140 Houses and Premises, have been received, and the Works executed at the Owners' cost. Brick Sewers were constructed in Woodfield Road and Place, Alfred Road, and Maida Hill West, for the more efficient drainage of the premises there, at a cost to the Vestry of £1,184. A portion of this sum will be re-paid to the Vestry by the Owners of the Houses on application to lay Drains into the Sewers. Pipe Sewers have been laid in Uxbridge Road and Lancaster Grate, for the better drainage of the roadways there, at a cost to the Vestry of £137. The 9-inch Pipe Sewers in portions of Porchester Mews and Chapel Side having become stopped and broken, they were removed and substituted by 9 and 12-inch Pipes, at a cost to the Vestry of £121. Two miles, one furlong, and sixty yards of Stoneware Drain Pipes have been laid down to the new Houses and Premises before mentioned, at an estimated cost to the Owners of Property of £766. « Seven hundred and twenty-two distinct Works relative to the repair of Sewers and Gulleys, laying pipe drains, and fixing traps, have been executed at a cost of £2,689. This sum includes £667 received 6 from various parties for fixing traps at outlets of drains, constructing gulleys in new Streets, laying drain pipes under Footways and Roadways in connection with House drains, and for examining drains as to causes of stoppage in them, and the want of traps. Seventy-seven examinations from Sewers were made as to the causes of stoppage in House drains, and whether trapped at their outlets, at a cost to the Applicants of £15:8:0. In addition to the above mentioned Works, one hundred and sixty subjects of Complaint have been received and entered in a Book kept for that purpose, referring to stoppages in Gulleys and Drains, and other matters. In a majority of instances the drains were relieved, and the remaining cases were promptly attended to. The operations of Cleansing Sewers, Gulleydrains and Catch-pits, were carried out under the general Contracts, from the passing of the Metropolis Management Act in 1856 to March, 1873; but since that period the Works have been performed by workmen under the immediate control of the Vestry with satisfactory results, as under:— Upward of 300 cubic yards of heavy deposits which impeded the flow of the sewage matter have been removed from brick Sewers to the surface of the Streets, and thence carted away. The Catch-pits constructed beneath the grates of the Street Gulleys have been emptied 7 and cleansed, and the deposits removed therefrom at the rate of 42 gulleys per day, making the aggregate of 12,937 removals during the year, and The various Pipe Sewers have been flushed with water and cleansed as often as considered necessary. Improvements in the Sewers and Street Gulleys, as commenced by the Vestry in the year 1859, and continued from time to time as circumstances required, have been further carried out this year, as follows:— The construction of one side entrance in Leinster Gardens, affording ready means of access to the Sewers in the immediate neighbourhood. The formation of 56 Air Openings in the Man-holes over Sewers, with Cast Iron Ventilating Grates fixed level with the surface of the Carriage-ways; and many of these Gratings being moveable are of great service in saving of labour during the Cleansing of the Sewers, as the workmen are thereby enabled to remove the heavy deposits by means of buckets to the surface of the Roads. The construction and re-construction of 191 Gulleys, and the repair of 112 others in various Streets of the Parish. On the south side of Harrow Road, opposite the flank of No. 7, Blomfield Crescent, an Urinal, with Slate screens, and fitted with a constant Water supply 8 apparatus into the basons of Urinal, has been erected for the accomodation of six persons. Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses. The following Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been carried out in accordance with the 87th Section of the Act of 1862. date of order. locality. subsidiary names abolished. no. of houses re-numbered. 1873.

The deaths from zymotic diseases (almost the same as last winter quarter) are very low. It is not uncommon for 20 per cent. of the deaths to be from zymotic diseases, here they are only about 11 per cent. of the total deaths. More than half are from whooping-cough in young children. It was fatal to 30 children, whilst last quarter it was fatal in 28 cases. This disease has now in 15 months, destroyed 94 children, and it is difficult to say the amount that 2 has suffered, but, as probably 10 per cent. are fatal cases, it would be about 1000 children who have been attacked by this disease, occuring chiefly in closely crowded streets and houses. The mischief it causes to the organs of respiration, is often permanent in after life. The deaths of child population under (5 years of age) are within 4 of the corresponding quarters of last and of previous years, viz.:—182 in 1873; 186 in 1872; 180 in 1871. These deaths, as well as the tubercular deaths, are much higher than natural. Consumptive diseases destroy a greater number of people annually, even in this healthy Parish, than the zymotic or epidemic forms of disease. In all probability at some future time, not far distant, it will be known that this destructive disease, in a great measure is preventible, by a superior knowledge and effective execution of hygienic laws. The evil does not end with the death of the individual sufferer, the predisposition of a parent is transmitted silently to the offspring, often in spite of sanitary regulations. But imperfect sanitary surroundings, miserable housing, overcrowding, and bad feeding, where families have an hereditary taint, will for many years furnish an abundant crop of this blighting affection in the population of our large towns. How this result is to be prevented, is a matter in which all classes of society are deeply concerned, and it urgently calls for attention. TABLE II.

It is sad to find so many families living in single rooms— —rooms varying in cubic, space from 750 in a back room to 1250 in the front, allowing for each individual where there is a family, less than 300 cubic feet of breathing space. This, with closed doors and windows at night, is far too little for healthy existence. These places, cabins I may call them, are clean, tidy, and comfortable, and I am sorry to say represent not only the modest dwelling of an aged widow receiving Parish relief, but the homes of artizans receiving high wages. It is satisfactory to say that only a few are the reverse of what may be called respectable and comfortable homes, and when they are otherwise, it is too frequently owing to improvident and drinking habits. The conditions and difficulties under which a family is placed when living in one room can scarcely be realized without occular demonstration. Imagine the picture of a back and front room occupied by two distinct families. Besides the living inmates, man, wife, four children in one room; man, wife, five children, one a grown up lad, a big girl or younger children in another, 7 furniture, garments and bedding, cooking utensils and fuel, have to be stowed away; and in a small landing on the stairs, amongst other things the perambulator has to be hung up. What space can there be to move when all the family are at home ? In a mixed population of streets and houses of this kind, I ascertained from the Census returns of 1871, that about 17 per cent, would be children under 5 years of age; and the Inspector in his enumeration of children in this district under 15 years of age, estimated the amount at 1,200. In the inspection of these streets and houses the works ordered from time to time have pressed heavily upon landlords. The Sanitary Committee have in my opinion done, and continue do, all that as local authority it can attempt to do. It secures as much as possible that indoor-life shall be safe from the smells and nuisances arising from imperfect house drains, from bad water supply, and deficient means of ventilation. The upper sashes of windows are all made to open freely. It is however still to be feared that the young, and even many of the adults, succumb to the influences of polluted air and other evils from overcrowding in built-up parts of this district. There are many diseases affecting the vital stamina, which in time ought to be much better understood, and their causes removed. What we may venture to hope is, that the Vestry, which has already taken the initiative in this Parish (in the opening of St. Mary's Church-yard, and Paddington Green) will avail itself of the opportunity of providing open spaces with seats, or recreation grounds, so that all classes alike may have the privilege of enjoying fresh air and sunshine, weather permitting. At present, old men and women, and young children, and invalids, who cannot get so far as the parks—the large squares being closed to them—are too much exposed to the dangers of street traffic. It is within the range of municipal duty to secure and maintain open spaces, to plant and ornament them for the public benefit. School Boards will ultimately, I hope, as part of their function try to provide proper play-grounds for the recreation of school children, instead of leaving them to play in the street, much to the annoyance of householders, and danger to themselves.

The death-rate from 464 deaths, is 17.7 per 1000 of the estimated population, the birth-rate 27.5. Out of 40 deaths in St. Mary's Hospital, 18 were of persons brought from other parishes; some from adjoining, others from country places. It may be fairly calculated that more persons go away from this Parish, and die at homes elsewhere, than of those who come here to die. 37 deaths took place in the Workhouse, 2 in the Lock Hospital, making 16 per cent. of the total deaths in public institutions of the Parish; this is about the average. 48 Inquests were held in the Parish this quarter. 2 The diarrhœa cases are always high in the Summer quarters. 64 out of 70 deaths were in young children, and more than half of these were registered as suffering from tabes, marasmus, atrophy, convulsions, in fact mal-nutrition generally, indicative of feeble health from other grave maladies, which sooner or later would have proved fatal; the diarrhoea was simply a concommitant symptom with other diseases. In 30 cases where the duration of the diarrhoea is stated, the average period is 10 days, ending generally with exhaustion. Out of 47 deaths in the Zymotic class, there was no smallpox; 25 were from measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough together; 9 were cases of fever, including typhoid; 3 of blood poisoning (a term getting into more general use), and 13 are recorded under erysipelas, pyaemia, &c. (a real blood poisoning). In fact, these fever and pyæmia cases should be better defined as to their origin and known causes. Consumption and its allied diseases are as usual very high, 89 or 19.2 per cent. of deaths from all fatal causes. Out of the 27 deaths from violence, 16, or more than half are from street accidents and railway traffic. There are 4 cases of infanticide, one of suicide by pistol-shot. The public health was upon the whole very satisfactory last quarter. TABLE II. Deaths from Zymotic and other Diseases, from July 5th, to September 27th, 1873. Weeks. ending Small-Pox. Measles.

There is however a less proportion of families occupying single rooms than in many other neighbouring streets. The Woodfield Road District for instance, with almost the same number of houses, has 400 more persons, averaging 13 in each house, and a larger proportion of families occupying single rooms only, but there is ample space on all sides. The canal once divided these two districts, but the opening of the Carlton Bridge now opens up in this suburb a thoroughfare to the east and west, which has long been needed. No. 26.

The severe fog in the early part of December increased the mortality of the following week, and many aged people succumbed to its effects. The deaths of 6 persons, upwards of 90 were registered last quarter out of the 18 who were above 80. The 480 deaths registered in the two sub-districts indicate a rate of 19.08 per 1000 of the present estimated population, and of births 26 per 1000. Whooping Cough was fatal to 11 young children, and Measles to 14. The 12 fever cases are a very mixed category, 2 are registered 2 as Malarious; of the others only 7 are true Typhoid cases. To find 57, or only 11 per cent. of the deaths in one quarter from the Zymotic class of disease in a population of above 100 thousand is a most favorable state of civic salubrity, and, I am afraid will not long continue; indeed the Measle epidemic begins to show itself here. It has been travelling Westward for some weeks. The deaths of young children (under 5 years) arc shamefully high. It amounts to 32.5 per cent. of the whole, or one-third, but that is about the same in all large towns. Ignorance of mothers in child-feeding and child-rearing prevails to a very great extent. There were 30 deaths in the workhouse infirmary; 43 in St. Mary's Hospital, some of these latter were brought from outside parishes. Amongst the deaths from violence, and some not certified, 32 Inquests were held. 27 Bodies were received into the Mortuary during the quarter, and the fever carriage was employed for removals 6 times. Amongst the violent deaths, 3 children died from the effects of burns from clothes taking fire; 5 were accidentally suffocated in bed beside the father or mother. 2 newly-born children were murdered by some person or persons at present unknown; one man committed suicide; 8 accidents were fatal from street or railway traffic; and a poor fellow was torn to pieces by a bear at the Welsh Harp.

It appears upon inspection now made that 618 families, or nearly half the population of this class of street live in single rooms as their dwelling. Sanitary works, and the accustomed visits of the Inspector have kept these houses in decent condition, and over-crowded rooms have been greatly diminished of late years. The houses of the Moscow Road group are getting old, and rather dilapidated, but they have one advantage over more modern built houses for the working class population, that they have small yards or gardens, either in front or behind, or both, and there is more open space. In the Moscow group 325 houses have only a population of 2507 inhabitants, or 7.7 to each house, while in the Hampden Street district 355 houses have 4035 people in them, or 11.3 to each house; neither have the latter space worth calling a yard or garden, back or front. 7 The houses in most of the modern streets are also loftier and narrow, so that fresh air and sunshine in these dwellings are scarce; yet these places are the only recreation grounds for the hundreds of young children who are to be seen playing in the intervals of school time. The child population here varies from about 12 to 17 per cent. of the whole, and it is a sad neglect of civic duty not to have provided for them more open spaces with trees and thick foliage, for in the midst of dense populations they act as lungs in purifying and oxygenating the atmosphere. The houses of Hampden Street, and some other adjoining streets have been under special inspection on account of frequent complaints of smells and dampness. They were originally built upon ground with imperfectly prepared foundations. The basement, ground-floor or parlour-floor is often offensive, and upon examination of drains they are found to be of red earth, tile or brick drains, that have given way at the joints, or going into decay, occasionally stop. The soil becomes saturated. Sanitary orders for constructive works have done much to remedy these defects ; but where deep draining of the soil was originally neglected, the local drainage will never be perfect. Upon referring to table VI. it will be observed that there is a very dense packing of population—700, 800, or 900 in a single street—and where the child population is so large, there is always a high rate of mortality from various causes combined. The chances of life are only half as good as it should be in these streets, compared with more favored places in town or country. The Scavenging of Crowded Streets. The scavenging of many streets throughout the whole Parish is not done sufficiently often. Once a week is not enough. The men and carts ought to come round every second day, or even daily. House-dust as well as vegetable and animal refuse is thrown into the streets from the front windows of the houses, instead of it being taken to the dust bin below. This is done in spite of cautions given continually. I have observed to-day in my visits potatoe peelings and all kind of vegetables, fish bones, scrapings of plates, pieces of bread, a dead cat with bowels protruding, and the dust sweepings from almost every second house, all of which will be allowed to remain until the cart comes round some days hence. 8 The following Reports and Pamphlets on Public Health have been received with thanks:— Manual for Medical Officers of Health, by Ed.
