To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District of Barking Town. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you the Annual Report upon the sanitary conditions of your district during the year 1914. A year in which the amenities of life were to a great extent overshadowed by the international crisis through which we were passing, and as a consequence, public works were directed so as to alleviate any distress that might arise from the sudden transition, from a state of peace to that of war. The adaption was remarkably facile, and it is with some gratification that it can be said that there was no distress of any serious moment, in fact, in many cases the financial position of the household was improved. It has yet to be seen for how long the community as a whole can stand the enormous wastage of life and treasure that is at present occuring. 4 Natural and Social Conditions of the District. The physical features and general characters have been described in previous reports and need not be reiterated, though the fact that the district possesses a waterway suitable for barge traffic, and vacant land on which factories can be built, does not seem to have the influence on industrial growth that might have been expected. The climatic conditions as indicated by the rainfall are as follows:— 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914. January .71 1.44 1.07 3.16 2.48 .53 February .74 2.26 .99 1.46 .59 2.5 March 2.77 .87 1.37 2.09 1.76 3.13 April 1.56 1.45 1.40 .05 1.99 .7 May 1.36 2.01 .80 .90 1.30 1.96 June 2.55 1.92 1.90 2.49 .33 1.52 July 2.94 2.37 .39 1.16 2.02 1.37 August 1.66 1.93 .62 3.88 1.94 .72 September 1.90 .82 1.39 2.01 1.33 .52 October 3.86 1.92 3.16 1.55 3.46 1.1 November .84 3.00 3.03 1.43 2.49 1.38 December 2.58 2.77 3.47 2.19 1.66 4.85 Total 23.47 22.70 19.59 22.37 21.35 20.28 The mean temperature during the summer was above the average, though the main features of the year were the dry autumn and extremely wet December. The gross effect on the health of the Town was not unfavourable. 5 Population. The population in March, 1911 (Census) was 31,294, and the mid-year population for 1914 was estimated at 34,685. The occupations followed by the inhabitants are as follows: — Males. Occupied and Unoccupied 11,510 Retired and Unoccupied 2,016 Engaged in Occupations 9,494 Occupations: — General and Local Government 177 Defence of Country 27 Professional and Subordinate Service 187 Domestic Oudoor Service 20 Domestic Indoor Service 86 Merchants, Insurance and Banking 129 Business Clerks 427 Railway 230 Roads 300 Sea 185 Dock Labourers, Coalporters, &c. 277 Messengers and Watchmen 273 Others 74 Agriculture 344 Miners and Quarries 36 Engineers and Machine Making 391 Iron and Steel Manufacture 137 Electrical Apparatus 123 Ships and Boats 72 Cycles, &c. 54 6 Occupations—continued: Precious Metals, Jewels, &c. 46 Building and Works of Construction 933 Wood Furniture and Fittings 177 Brick Makers 6 Earthenware, China and Glass 97 Chemicals, Explosives and India-rubber 1,213 Skins, Leather 50 Printers 195 Paper Trades 54 Textile Manufactures 28 Tailors 37 Boots, &c., Makers 46 Other Workers in Dress 67 Drapers 85 Food, Drink and Lodging 733 General Labourers 537 Gas 953 Other Services 688 In East Ham and Barking there were 3,856 persons employed in the manufacture of gas, of which 953 resided in Barking. Females. Retired or Unoccupied 8,464 Occupied:— Unmarried 2,330 Married 415 Widowed 212 7 Occupations:— Civil Service 19 Municipal, Hospital, &c. 12 Midwives, Nurses 46 Teaching 102 Professional 18 Domestic Indoor Service 494 Domestic Outdoor Service 144 Laundry and Washing 19 Others in Service 33 Clerks, Bank and Insurance 114 Agriculture 96 Metal and Electrical Workers 98 Jewellery, Games, &c. 5 Furniture and Decorations 8 Chemicals, Soap, &c. 352 Skins and Leather 17 Hair and Feathers 7 Papers and Books 69 Textile 51 Drapers, &c. 83 Tailoresses 41 Milliners 50 Dressmakers 230 Seamstresses, &c. 103 Boots, Clogs, &c. 2 Others in Dress 16 Food Workers 101 General Shopkeepers 197 Board and Lodging 173 Other Occupations 184 8 Proportion per 1,000 population engaged in occupations:— Married 72 Unmarried 473 Widowed 283 Married and Widowed 97 Proportion of Domestic Indoor Servants per 1,000 families, 78. The main occupations for males are Match, India-rubber, Gas, Building Trades and Transport. The proportion of occupied women is high, being approximately 25 per cent, of these over 20 years. The main occupations for females are match-making, domestic indoor service and dressmaking, in its various branches. It is to be noted that in 93 per cent, of the families of the town, no indoor domestic help is obtained. The number of outdoor domestic workers is also small. The proportion of married workers is 7 per cent., a small figure when the type of district is borne in mind. The occupations followed are not specially prejudicial to health, and no deaths can be directly attributed to their injurious effects. The amount of poverty, as judged by the Poor Law Administration, has not been great. The figures are as follows:— 1913. 1914. Out-Relief £1,973 6s. 7id. £2,206 15s. l¼d. Men. Women. Children. Men. Women Children. Admissions to Infirmary 76 25 13 88 44 20 ,, ,, House 89 32 90 68 41 45 165 57 103 156 85 65 Total 325. Total 306. 9 In view of the events of the past year, the figures are most gratifying. The extent to which voluntary charities have been used cannot be definitely stated, as no returns can be obtained from the London hospitals. Sanitary Circumstances. Water Supply.—The town itself is supplied by the South Essex Water Company, and no complaint as to the quality of the supply has been made. The rural part of the district is supplied by wells. In two cases contamination was detected and a notice was served on the owner to provide a proper water supply. The matter is still pending. Rivers, &c.—Some complaint was made during the warm weather of offensive odours arising from the sediment left opposite the Town Quay, when exposed at low water. A more frequent cleansing of the basin seems desirable. Drainage and Sewerage.—The question of drainage and sewage disposal has received attention. Information is being collected, and will be submitted at a suitable opportunity. Closet Accommodation.—The whole town is on the water carriage system with the exception of 61 cesspools, 19 pail closets, and 42 privies. The latter are in the rural parts of the district. Scavenging.—The owners of property are required to supply and maintain a suitably covered receptacle for house refuse, which is collected once weekly by the Council's own workmen. The district is worked by two gangs, each under a working foreman. 10 Some help would be afforded if all house-holders could be persuaded to burn all perishable material before placing it in the covered recepticles provided. It would help to alleviate the fly nuisance which is apt to occur in the warmer months, and also assist materially should any difficulties arise in the sanitary services during the coming summer. Sanitary Inspection of the District. Premises Inspected:— House to House 772 Complaints 118 Infectious Disease 266 Miscellaneous 2,841 Total number of premises inspected 3,997 The chief defects discovered were dirty and defective walls and ceilings, defective water closet and connections, pans and flushing apparatus, defective roofs and spouting, defective yard paving, and dilapidated dustbins. To abate the defects and nuisances discovered, 951 preliminary and 146 statutory notices were served, all of which have been complied with. Premises and Occupations which can be controlled by Bye-laws or Regulations—Offensive Trades—The offensive trades conducted within the district are: —Blood Drier, one; Fat Boiler, one; Gut Scraper, one; Marine Store Dealers, nine; of which four have been closed during the year; Piggeries, nine, of these two were closed during the year. 11 Proceedings were instituted against two firms under the Nuisance Section of the 1875 Act. The firms concerned admitted the offence, and the prosecution was conditionally withdrawn. The works required have in one case been satisfactorily carried out, but in the other certain work is still outstanding, and no action has been taken in the matter up to the end of the year. The dust shoot at Creeksmouth was re-opened in November, and is receiving some 200 tons or more of refuse per day. This is to be regretted, and should it still continue, rigid bye-laws should be drawn up so as to lessen the nuisance that is inevitable. It is hardly possible to prevent the shoot from firing, and the fumes that will be given off are highly offensive. Some increase in the fly nuisance is to be expected. Common Lodging Houses.—There are six licensed common lodging houses in the district, the accommodation provided is for 126 persons. There is no underground sleeping accommodation. Schools.—The sanitary condition of the schools has been maintained. No schools were closed during the year on account of epidemic disease. Several cases of whooping cough occurred at the Castle School in July, the holidays supervened and no further cases were noted when the school re-opened. Subsequently the disease spread over the whole town and caused some disturbance in the attendance. After a period of low incidence, Scarlet Fever also become prevalent from September onwards. The disease was widely diffused, and no particular school could be selected as being a centre of spread. Food. Milk Supply.—There are two small dairy farms within the district, the remaining supply comes from large central 12 depots in the City of London. Rather a larger proportion of condensed than fresh milk is consumed within the district. The number of samples taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for the year ending December 31st, 1914, were:— Milk, 62; Butter, 72; Other Samples, 3; Total, 137. The results of legal proceedings were as follow:— Milk Adulteration:— 1 person fined £10 and 9/- costs. 1 person fined £2 and 9/- costs. 1 person fined 10/- and 9/- costs. 1 person fined 10/- inclusive. For assault one person fined £2 and 4/- costs. 1 person ordered to pay costs. 1 case was withdrawn. Other Foods.—156 inspections have been made to shops where food is exposed and prepared for sale. 166 inspections to slaughter-houses during slaughtering. No tubercular meat has been condemned. The following articles were destroyed at the request of the owners:—Three cases of rabbits, a quantity of overripe fruit, one box of haddocks and one box of cod. Housing The number of persons per family and size of tenement occupied as shown by the Census of 1911 are as follows:— 13 Number of Rooms per Tenement.

These had a population of 3,348, giving the proportion per cent, to population in private families as 10.8 or in 10.8 of the families of the town, this standard of overcrowding had been exceeded. It is to be noted that the estimate of overcrowding given by ourselves was 122 houses in 1914. The buildings comprising the town and the use to which they are put are as follows:— 15 1911. Total, 1901. Total, 1911. Ordinary Dwelling Houses. Blocks of Flats. Shops. Hotels and Public Houses. Offices, Warehouses and Factories. Institutions Others. Vessels. Sheds. Vag rants.

The estimated number of dwelling-houses in the District of the Local Authority 6,721 2. The estimated number of dwelling-houses within the limit of rent applicable to the District under Section 14 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909 2,900 3. The number of dwelling-houses which have been inspected under and for the purposes of Section 17 of that Act and the particulars required by the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910, duly recorded:— (a) Within the limit of rent applicable to the District under Section 11 1,484 (b) Above that limit 459 4. By what date can the inspection of dwelling-houses within the limit of rent above referred to be completed and the necessary records made? 2 years 5. (1) How many of the dwelling-houses inspected were found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation:— (a) Within the limit of rent above referred to 93 (b) Above that limit 19 17 (2) And how many of those houses are still in that state:— (а) Within the limit of rent referred to 6 (b) Above that limit 5 6. (1) How many of the dwelling-houses inspected, though not found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, were seriously defective from the point of view of danger to health or structural faults:— (a) Within the limit of rent above referred to 1,129 (a) Above that limit 261 (2) And how many of those houses are still in such defective condition:— (а) Within the limit of rent above referred to 95 (b) Above that limit 2 7. The number of vacant houses suitable for persons of the working classes and in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation nil 8. The number of houses which are overcrowded on the basis adopted in the Census Returns, viz., more than two persons to a room 122 it. Number of new houses which in the opinion of the Local Authority is required to provide any necessary accommodation for persons of the working classes in the District and the nature and extent of such accommodation, e.g., separate houses, tenements, number of rooms. The Council are now erecting about 130 additional houses for the working classes. Further schemes for the erection of additional houses will shortly be submitted to the Board. 18 The work done by the sanitary staff under the Housing Acts is as follows:— Number of dwelling-houses inspected under Section 17 682 Number of dwelling-houses dangerous or injurious to health 345 Number of representations made to the Authority 11 Number of Closing Orders made *11 Number of defects remedied without Closing Order 334 Made fit after Closing Order *11 * In abeyance. General character of defects found were dilapidated condition of inside walls and ceilings; insufficient ventilation to room; damp walls owing to no damp course and no under floor ventilation; defective floors and woodwork. it is to be noted that a shortage of house accommodation still exists, in spite of the number of houses built by the Council. The inevitable result is a rise in rentals as the following figures taken from the London County Council's report on new working-class accommodation show. Rentals in 1911 (census):— Three rooms, 4/6; four rooms, 5/10½; five rooms, 8/1; six rooms, 11/6; or an average rental of 1/6 per room. Rentals in 1913:—Three rooms, 5/6; four rooms, 8/6; five rooms, 9/4; or an average of 1/11¼ per room. This constitutes a rise of 5¼d. per room per week, or nearly 30 per cent. It is obvious that private enterprise is not meeting the demand, and a 19 situation is produced which justifies the action of the Council in building cottages to supply the obvious need. The alterations in the buildings are as follows:— 1913. 1914. Houses Erected 163 227 Houses Demolished 4 — Shops Completed 5 7 Factories and Workshops 4 12 Alterations and Additions 31 5 This shows a substantial increase on the previous year. The houses erected by the Council under the powers given by the Housing Act are as follows:— Situation. No. of Houses. Date of Occupation. Accommodation. Rental per week. Frontage in feet. Depth of land to each house. ft. in. ft.

Wood Block Paving.—Ripple Road from St. Paul's Road to Westbury Road, 3,670 surface yards. 20 Sanitary Administration of the District. The work of the department has undergone some change during the year. The visiting relative to Tuberculosis was handed over to the County Authorities, the object being to prevent any overlapping in the spheres of influence. The Tuberculosis ()fficer has been appointed Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Tuberculosis by the Council. Staff.—The staff employed during the year was as follows:— Medical Officer of Health. R. J. Ewart, M.D., F.R.C.S., D.P.H. Assistant Medical Officer for Tuberculosis. Vacant. Medical Officer to the Maternity Centre. A. W. G. Woodforde, M.B. Sanitary Inspector. H. Wood, Certified Sanitary Inspector, Meat and other Foods Inspector. Assistant Sanitary Inspector. W. Claydon, Certified Sanitary Inspector, Meat and other Foods Inspector. Female Assistant Sanitary Inspector. Aliss M. Holman, Certified Sanitary Inspector and Midwife. Matron Isolation Hospital. Miss M. J. Chrystie. 21 The scope of the work undertaken by the male Inspectors includes the supervision of the sanitary arrangements of all premises, dust collection, lodging-houses, slaughter-houses, offensive trades, workrooms, van dwellers, and meat and other foods. The administration of the Foods and Drugs Act, is undertaken by the County Authorities. The female officer is mainly concerned with the sanitary arrangement of schools, the administration of the Notification of Births Act, and duties relative to the Maternity Centre. Hospital Accommodation.—The new administrative block was occupied at the beginning of the year and the Medical Officer of Health became resident at the Hospital in May. The accommodation provided has been increased from 50 to 65 beds or one to every 500 of the population, a figure that is in excess of requirements of the Central Authorities. From January to September the Lower Hospital was temporarily closed, as the accommodation at the Upper Hospital sufficed for all needs. The laundry unfortunately gave considerable trouble, and towards the end of the year its capabilities were severely taxed. The question of replacing this unsuitable building by one on more modern lines should be considered; certain improvements of an inexpensive nature might be made at the Lower Hospital so that the facilities for out-door exercise during inclement weather may be obtained. The staff has changed considerably during the year owing to an attempt to keep a reasonable balance between the numbers of patients and nurses. The number of patients and staff for the first half-year were approximately equal; for the second half there were two patients for every member of the staff including the Medical Officer. The hospital cannot be said to have been understaffed. The cost of the hospital for the year was £2,122 16s. 6d., against £1,623 12s. 10d., or approximately an increase ot 22 £500. This increase is dependent upon £178 for interest and repayment of loans, £75 for furniture, £50 for construction of discharge block and certain extra baths, £50 for making up the grounds, planting, etc., and £60 for alterations required for Medical Officer's residence, all of which constitute items involved in the erection of the new building. Excess of expenditure over original loan on the building and cost of fencing are not included. The Cost of Food was £413 2s. 0d., as against £383 6s. 4d. or an increase of £69, which can be accounted for by the allround increase in prices of commodities, and also to the greater number of admissions and increased staff. The cost of food per day per patient and staff was 9½d. being the same as that for the year 1913. The cost per day per patient was calculated to be 5d. and per member of staff 1/4. Admissions to Hospital.—The number of cases admitted and their nature were as follows:— 148 were suffering from Scarlet Fever; 35 Diphtheria; 10 Enteric Fever; and 14 Diarrhoea (infants) giving a total of 207. The previous year the total number of admissions was 153 or 54 less. The discrepancy was mainly due to an increase of 35 cases of Scarlet Fever during the current year. There were 10 deaths in the Institution, two from Scarlet Fever, one Enteric Fever, one Pneumonia, and six Diarrhoea. The average duration of stay in Hospital for each disease was as follows:— 1914. 1913. 1912. 1911. Scarlet Fever 37.26 37.1 39.5 52.44 days Diphtheria 27.7 22.7 32.1 40.8 ,, Enteric Fever 25.0 19.5 41.2 40.0 ,, 23 The mean number of occupied beds was 18 and staff 11. The corresponding figures for the previous five years were patients 18 and staff 10. of the 148 cases of Scarlet Fever 12 were returned cases, and arose from six infecting cases or a leakage from the hospital of five per cent of all admissions. The number of return cases in each family were four in one, three in two, two in two, and one in one instance, respectively. Five of the return cases were admitted within 14 days, and the rest within six weeks. The percentage is high, and is somewhat disappointing, as the precautions taken were very elaborate. In four of the cases there was no sign in the child discharged, that might possibly have been indicative of the existence of infection. The complications were 10 per cent. Ear discharge, four per cent. Nephritis, two per cent. Abscess of Cervical Glands, and in one Laryngeal Obstruction, which necessitated tracheotomy. In six per cent, the original diagnosis was incorrect, and one of these subsequently developed the disease. Two children admitted for Diphtheria also developed Scarlet Fever whilst in hospital. In 10 or 28 per cent, of the cases of Diphtheria the original diagnosis was incorrect. One case of Diphtheria required tracheotomy. There were no deaths. Out of 10 cases of Enteric Fever six proved to be suffering from other diseases. One case died. In accordance with the regulations passed by the Council in July last, 14 babes suffering from Marasmus and Diarrhoea were admitted, and out of these six died, or 43 per cent. It is extremely doubtful whether these infants were in any way improved by their stay in hospital. 24 Legal.—The General and Adoptive Acts in force in the district arc as follows:— Public Health Act, 1875. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890 (Parts II., III., & V.). Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885. Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889. Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890. Factory and Workshops Acts. Tuberculosis Regulations, 1911, 1912 & 1914. Order of Local Government Board, making Tuberculosis compulsorily notifiable. Housing of the Working Classes, Acts 1890 to 1903. Housing and Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899. Notification of Births Act, 1907. Baths and Wash.houses Acts. Bye.Laws relating to Public Health. Common Lodging.houses. Nuisances. Slaughter.houses. Management of a Mortuary. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. Houses let in Lodgings. Removal of filth through streets, 1912. Fish Fryers, 1913. New Streets and Buildings, 1913. Public Baths. Offensive Trades. Bakehouses. Temporary Van Sheds and similar structures. 25 Application was made during the year for the renewal of a Knacker's Licence; the application was refused, and an appeal to Quarter Sessions was made, but was subsequently withdrawn. Chemical and Bacteriological Examinations. Examinations of tubercular material is, in pursuance of the arrangement with the County, undertaken by them. All doubtful cases of Diphtheria are examined for Bacilli, and also all cases before discharge from hospital. Twenty.five initial and 35 final examinations were made. Examination of contacts were undertaken, but in no instance was isolation considered necessary as a result of such examination. Prevalence of and Control over Acute Infectious Diseases. There were 586 notifications received during the year compared with 477 and 301 in 1913 and 1912, respectively. The number consisted of 162 cases of Scarlet Fever, 46 Diphtheria, 11 Enteric Eever, 304 Tuberculosis. The rates for 1913 and 1914 are: — 1913. 1914. Scarlet Fever 3.92 4.67 Diphtheria 1.04 1.32 Enteric Fever 11 .32 Tuberculosis (all forms) 7.03 8.7 26 Deaths from Zymotic Diseases.—These include: — Enteric Fever, 1; Scarlet Fever, 3; Diphtheria and Croup, 3; Diarrhoea and Enteritis, 30; total, 3.7. All the rates are larger than in previous year. The distribution of the disease over the year was as follows: — 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter Scarlet Fever 26 30 27 79 Diphtheria and Memb. Croup 6 5 11 24 Phthisis 76 89 60 79 Enteric 3 1 3 4 Erysipelas 15 5 9 18 Ophthalmia Neonatorium Poliomyelitis and 3 3 3 6 Meningitis 1 - - - It is seen that the increase in Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria occurred during the last quarter of the year. A detailed inquiry was made into the circumstances influencing the spread of these diseases. The report is, however, too voluminous to include in the present statement. The procedure relative to the notification of these diseases is as follows:—On receipt of information a member of the Sanitary Staff or the Medical Officer himself calls and arranges for the removal of the patient, by this means 148 out of 162 cases of Scarlet Fever were removed. Inquiry is made relative to the health of all immediate contacts, and in cases of poverty, should any further illness supervene, the facilities of the Out.Patient Hospital are placed at their disposal. All bedding is disinfected, and if necessary the rooms occupied are stripped and re.decorated. 27 Antiseptic is supplied for purposes of washing linen and disinfecting drains, etc. Suitable instructions are given as to precautions necessary to prevent further spread through healthy contacts. The action taken relative to the non.notifiable diseases is narrative in the part dealing with the Medical Inspection of School Children. Vaccination.—The figures for the last three years are: — 1912. 1913. 1914. Successfully Vaccinated 420 360 309 Insusceptible — — 1 Conscientious Objections 343 394 417 Died Unvaccinated 71 75 66 Postponed 6 8 7 Removed to Places Unknown To be dealt with (not six 53 40 40 months old) 8 136 146 The percentages successfully vaccinated for the last six years are: 66.3, 59.6, 54.6, 46.6, 35.5, 30.4. Comment on this shrinkage is needless. It is to be hoped that the inevitable chaos in the sanitary services of Europe will.not lead to an outbreak, which would in course of time involve this country. Prevalence of and Control over Tuberculosis. There were 304 notifications of tuberculosis forwarded to the office, including 212 new cases. These consisted of 143 28 Pulmonary and 69 other forms. The rates being 8.7 ner 1,000 inhabitants. Pulmonary. Other. Form A (Primary Notifications) 125 65 Form B (School Cases) 18 4 Form C (Admissions to Institutions) 45 2 Form C (Discharges from Institutions) 41 4 Taking the figures for last year and subtracting the number in institutions, the number dead, the number discharged from the dispensary, there are at least 330 persons or 10 ner cent, of the population who are suffering from this disease, and who may be the source of further infection. The age distribution was: — Under 1 year 1.5 515 15.25 25.45 45.65 Over 65 Total. Phthisis 3 11 42 39 87 40 7 229 Other Tubercular Diseases 2 19 28 15 10 — 1 75 The total number of deaths was 55. The mean death.rate from Tuberculosis prior to compulsory notification was .96 per 1,000, subsequent to notification it is 17 or nearly twice as great. The following figures are extracted from the monthly returns made by the Tuberculosis Officer to the County Authorities, and in pursuance of his appointment by the District Council as Assistant Medical Officer for Tuberculosis are included in the present statement. 29 The dispensary was opened in April, and the following figures deal with the last nine months of the year: — Insured. Uninsured. Patients treated at the Dispensary 56 53 Total, 109 Discharged during the nine months: — With working capacity restored 6 Worse and ordered Dom. Treatment ... 12 Sent to Sanatoria 12 Left District 7 Domiciliary Visits paid by Tuberculosis Officer 53 Domiciliary Visits paid by Nurse ... 317 Deaths from Tuberculosis.—There were 55 deaths certified as due to some form of Tuberculosis, as against 28. 40, 30, 35, and 69 in the previous five years, the rates being 1.03, 0.86, 115, 0.81, and 1.9 respectively. The details are as follows: — 1914. 1913. 1912. Phthisis . 48 50 28 Tubercular Meningitis . 6 13 1 Other Tubercular Diseases 1 6 6 30 Investigation of Other Diseases. The cause of death deserves a little comment: The number amongst males was 234, and females 170, a ratio which Is usual. There were no deaths from Measles, as against 30 for the previous year. The same applies to Whooping Cough. The deaths from the other zymotic diseases show little variation, the rate being 1.1 (37) as against 1.98 (67). Diarrhoea and Enteritis accounted for 31, as against 30 for the previous year. The conditions of August, 1914, were very much more favourable to these diseases than that of 1913, and hence the figure may represent some improvement. The experiment tried during July of addressing a personal letter to all mothers who are known to possess an infant from the 6th to 18th month does seem to have led to an amount of extra care and consequent benefit to the child. Pneumonia in all forms is low as compared with 1913, the figure being 29, as against 54. The number of deaths arising from Congenital Malformations, etc., shows an improvement, the figure being 35, against 68. Much is due to a favourable year, but some at least is dependent on the sanitary administration. Cancer or Malignant Disease was responsible for 16 deaths,, which closely approximates to that for the previous year. Out.Patient Dispensary. The following table gives the nature of the ailments treated at the above. The number of children under school 31 age was more than double that of the previous year, namely, 525, against 235. Those over school age show a corresponding increase:— Other than School Children. Under School Over School Age. Age.

The Need for Pre.natal Clinics.—Tlie following figures speak for themselves. Of all "conceptions" 10 per cent, are lost through abortion or other accident before the sixth month of gestation and approximately 4 per cent, are still.born, that is, they had reached such a stage of development where'independent life was possible, and 5 percent, die within a few weeks of birth. Thus close on 20 per cent, or one in five are lost through errors and defects in the nutrition of the child during its developmental period. This mortality is unfortunately extremely heavy on the males. The ratio for all conceptions is 125 males per 100 females, whilst at birth it is only 106 to 100 females, a fact of great significance at the present time, when large numbers of our best manhood are being sacrificed for the sake of national honour. 2. Financial Assistance.—Grants to the extent of 50 per cent, of actual expenditure will be refunded by the Local Government Board for such work as has been approved by them, and such as comes strictly under t(he scope of their circular of July, 1914. All grants, whether for expenditure incurred by the Authority or by voluntary agencies in the district will be paid through the Council. 3. Work to be undertaken in connection with Plaistow Maternity Charity.—This will comprise the following: — (a) Pre.natal.—The compilation of a register of expectant mothers, based on returns from the Certified Mid. wives in the district. 33 Each mother will be visited by one of the Council's servants or a voluntary worker, and advised to attend the Maternity Centre. A medical practitioner of the district will attend once weekly at a convenient place and will examine and advise all those presenting themselves. He will correct errors of life and treat such abnormalities as are observed. In such cases where food is deficient certain charities are available whereby nourishment can be obtained. The cost of this portion of the scheme will be : — Medical Attendance one noon, per week £52 per annum Visiting £15 „ Incidental Expenses £5 „ Rent of Room £25 „ £97 „ (b) Puerperal Abnormalities or Difficulties of Labour.—All cases of complicated pregnancy, such as severe bleeding and difficulties of delivery, which cannot be treated at home, are to be removed to the Plaistow Maternity Centre by means of the ambulance already possessed by the Council. In such cases where midwives require medical assistance and the husband is unable to pay the necessary fee, application should be made to the Council for assistance, which may be paid in whole or part, according to the circumstances of the household. The following scale is suggested:— For delivery with Forceps or other £ s. d. operation requiring Cholroform and after treatment 2 2 0 Difficult Delivery and Attendance 1 1 0 Single Attendance at Night 0 5 0 Single Attendance during day 0 2 6 34 Leaving out of account cases treated by the Plaistow Maternity Centre, the probable cost to the Authority in granting this facility will be about £2b.£30. Complications, subsequent to delivery, such as Puerperal Fever and Ophthalmia Neonatorum are treated at your Isolation Hospital and expenditure in this direction will qualify for grant. (c) Infant and Child Welfare.—This portion of the scheme is already in operation, and grants will be obtained for work already done. Further developments and amplifications will be necessary in the future, but for the present the work in hand as far as it goes has been approved . The estimated expenditure for the coming year should not exceed £150, half of which will be repaid. Work done by the Health Visitors. There were 983 births notified during the year and 977 registered. As many as 88 per cent, of the number of births notified received a visit from the Health Visitors. Out of 983 cases 406 were attended by a general practitioner and 577 by midwives; of these 232 received their assistance from the local branch of the Plaistow Maternity Charity. The following table gives the figures for the last four years:— 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914. Total number registered 1,005 964 1,009 977 Total number notified 885 908 934 983 Attended by doctors — 382 412 406 Attended by midwives — 556 522 577 Number visited 779 936 971 857 35 In 320 cases revisits were necessary; the total number of revisits being 1,230, which included visits paid to children born in 1913. The reasons why further supervision was required were: 141 first children, 10 twins, 35 poverty, 14 cleanliness, 34 artificial feeding, and 42 other causes. At the time of the first visit out of 857, 695 were entirely breast fed, 25 mixed, 24 artificially fed. At about the third month 227 were entirely breast fed, 56 mixed, and 37 artificially. Thus, within a short period of birth 93.4 are fed entirely at the breast, and 70 per cent, after three months. This point is also exemplified by the statements made as to the length of time the previous child to the one under enquiry was suckled. Age at which Last Child was Weaned, per 100. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914.

The following figures give some idea as to the reason of death other than its immediate cause. The last column gives 36 the percentage dying in first year, based on the experience cf the vears 1912.1913 : — Total Numbers 1913. 1914. Numbers dying in first year 1914.

Meetings are held from two to five on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at the School Clinic. The waiting room is used for general assembly purposes, and the consulting room for weighing and examination of infants. The weighing is performed by the Health Visitor in charge, and simple advice is given to the mothers on clothing, feeding, etc.; any infant whose progress is not satisfactory is examined by the Medical Officer of Health. A cup of tea is provided for each mother by the members of the Infant Care Association. The holding of an additional meeting on Thursday afternoons was commenced towards the end of last year, as some mothers found Tuesday, owing to domestic duties, an inconvenient day. This practice resulted in an increased attendance. In the year 1913 the average attendance per week was 18; in 1914 it had risen to 25; during the warm weather the weekly average was 30 to 35. The number of individual mothers who attended during the year was 244, of these 42 attended once only, the total number of attendances being 1,159, making an average attendance of four per mother. There are many who come regularly, either weekly or fortnightly, but the number should be larger. Regular attendance is most necessarv, as far more can be done for ' such a child than for one who is only brought up when it begins to show signs of wasting. The most regular attendants are those with "first" babies. Speaking generally these mothers seem greatly to appreciate the opportunity for obtaining advice with regard to feeding, clothing and so on. Great interest was shown in a model set of baby clothes (made in the workroom for unemployed women, from material supplied by the Council), and a "banana crate" cradle. Paper patterns of these garments are given to those who wish for them, and many mothers have availed themselves of this opportunity. 38 Infants' Milk Depot. This depot has now been in existence for two years, having been opened under the auspices of the Infant Care Association in February, 1913. Since March, 1914, the milk has been given in dried form. This change has the following advantages, it does not turn sour, is practically free from germs, is not liable to contamination by flies, etc., and the exact quantity required for each feed can be made as required. This food, "Lac.tos" is manufactured under the supervision and instruction of the Public Health Department, and is an exact imitation of human milk in dried form. It is sold at just over cost price. It is a great boon to the poorer mothers who could not afford similar foods, and who would otherwise feed their babies on condensed milk containing a low percentage of fat. A feeding depot is also a useful auxiliary to any infant care scheme as the child is under more constant supervision. With very few exceptions such infants are weighed at regular intervals. At the half.year the number of infants being fed on " Lactos " was 35 at the end of the year this number had increased to 51. The total number of infants who have received the food during the year is 135, with 10 deaths, a rate of 7.4 per cent. The following are particulars of some cases fed at the Milk Depot during the year: — Number 26. (Illegitimate). Breast fed for three weeks then artificially feed; brought to Clinic when two months old, weighed only 6 lbs.; after having Lactos for three months gained 4 lb., and at one year was a fine child normal weight. Number 122. Brought to Clinic when four months old, condition poor, fed on the breast and a patent food, food changed to Lactos; mother lost breast milk at five 39 months and child fed on Lactos only; steadily increased in weight and at 11 months weighed 241b. Number 123. (Illegitimate). Brought to Clinic when three weeks old weighing 71b. 6oz., fed on cows' milk and barley water, not thriving; put on Lactos, at once began to make good progress, and at 11 months weighed 20 lb.

There is no doubt that some of the improvement in the death.rate can be attributed to the steady decline in the birth.rate. 41 Marriages and Births. The conditions of the population as regards marriage in 1911 were as follows: — Persons. Males. Females. Females 14.45 years. Unmarried 18,745 9,627 9,118 2,919 Married 11,383 5,642 5,741 4,043 Widowed 1,166 417 749 110 There were 221 marriages, a figure practically the same as the previous year. The rates per 1,000 population for the last four years are 15., 9., 6.4 and 6.3 respectively. Out of the above number 188 were solemnised in the Church of England. Births. There were 977 births registered in the district and 12 were returned as of mothers ordinarily resident in the district and registered elsewhere, the total number being 989. Of these 36 were illegitimate. The percentage equals 3.7 of the total number of births, the figure for the previous year being 2.5. The relative number of sexes was 507 males and 482 females, the rate per 1,000 of the population works out to 30.4. The relation of this figure with previous years is given in the table, page 44. If the rate per 1,000 women 15 to 45 years of age is considered, it is seen to be the lowest on record. Peculiarities of the Areas of the District. Areas of a town have often been taken as a means of indicating the influences of surroundings on life expectancy and social amenities. Such comparisons are often fallacious, for two reasons, firstly, because the districts vary in age distribution, that is, certain areas contain a larger proportion of young adults or good lives than others; and secondly, the environment may attract people of certain peculiarities, and 42 what is observed may be the outcome of this rather than a reflection of the effect of the surroundings. The first of these can be allowed for, the second cannot. Bearing these reservations in mind the following figures are of some interest.
