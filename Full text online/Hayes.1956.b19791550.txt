To The Chairman and Members of the Council, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, A glance at the tables will show that there has been relatively little infectious disease in the district this year, the greatest incidence being that of upper respiratory infections. The number of notifications of measles is again very low. Although the biennial epidemic nature of the disease has been known for some time, it has not usually been evident in the statistics for a district such as this. Since 1953. however, the alternation in successive years of large with small numbers of notifications has become very marked. The majority of cases have occurred in children between the ages of 4-7 years. I expect these phenomena to continue, certainly for another year. There was some increase in the notification of dysentery and food poisoning but 15 of these cases occurred in Germany among a party returning to Hayes. In spite of this, the incidence of these disorders is of some concern to me, as the number of notifications received is no real indication of the amount of disease actually prevalent. The majority of doctors naturally do not bother to notify every case of diarrhoea they see, and furthermore many people with minor symptoms do not even see the doctor. As soon as word gets around that the sanitary man will come snooping round and keep your children away from school for weeks every effort is made to avoid the eye of authority. Any attempt at control of people carrying the germ is thus rendered farcical and the time has come when the whole position should be reconsidered. By special request of some members of the Public Health Committee an attempt has been made to show the age incidence of deaths from certain diseases. The table re 3 veals the kind of figures one would expect. In the age groups 30-49. approximately half the deaths are due to malignant disease. In the higher age groups this proportion decreases and the number of deaths from malignant disease equals that from cardiac causes but after the age of GO deaths from cardiac causes predominate more and more. It is interesting to note in passing that 4 of the 7 suicides occurring during 1956 were in the age group 50 59. There has been an increase in the estimated population of the district this year and both the birth rate and death rate are higher than they have been for a few years. Com parison of the corrected figures with the figures for England and Wales however shows that the birth rate for this district is lower and the death rate higher than the corresponding rates for the whole country. The infant death rate and the stillbirth rate for Hayes and Harlington are both lower this year than last and compare favourably with the rates for the district over the past few years. The vaccination against poliomyelitis foreshadowed in 1955 has materialised and details will be found elsewhere in this report No untoward effects are known to have occurred in this district but it is too early to be able to assess the effect on the incidence of the disease as a whole. Only 6 cases (with 1 death) were notified in this district as compared with 22 in 1955 but the rather poor summer we experienced may have had some bearing on the matter. New legislation this year has included the Clean Air Act which came into force on December 31st. It will be a long time before the full effects are felt but it is hoped that some improvement will be noticed with the gradual introduction of smokeless zones. Public Health in the district has received more publicity this year owing to some of the Council s activities. In May, detailed evidence of the work carried on was given at the public enquiry in connection with the petition for the grant of a Charter of Incorporation. At the Delegate Conference in November the Chairman of the Public Health Committee was well received when he presented a paper deal ing with the history of public health in general and the work carried out in the district at present. Included in 4 the Conference handbook was a comprehensive synopsis of all services relating to the health of the district. This covered those services provided by the County Council and other bodies as well as those of the Urban District Council. I hope this may have spread a little enlightenment regarding public health work, and may prove a useful reference when required. The printing of this report has been done this year by the Council's newly instituted printing department, and my thanks are due to its members for their co-operation. As a result I am able to present the report earlier than in previous years. Changes in personnel in the department which I reported in 1955 continued to occur in the early part of 1956, but had ceased by the end of the year, and successful efforts were made by the Public Health Inspectors to catch up with some of the arrears of work. The clerical staff have also had extra work owing to the Charter of Incorporation and the Delegate Conference and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking all members of the department for their willing support. I should also like to thank those members of the Council who have taken a particular interest in public health work during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant. V.SHAW. Medical Officer of Health. 5 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres)5 159 Population (Census 1951)65 608 Population (mid year 1956 Registrar Generals estimate of civilian population)66 460 Number of inhabited houses at 31st December 1956 18 967 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December 1956 £1 031 131 Product of penny rate £4 468 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births M F Total) Birth rate per Legitimate 513 463 976 1,000 of the Illegitimate 23 14 37 estimated pop ulation 15.2 Comparability Factor is 0.94 giving a corrected birth rate of 14 3 Birth rate for England and Wales 15.7 Birth rate for County of Middlesex (corrected) 13.2 Stillbirths M F Legitimate 9 10 Illegitimate Deaths: M F 282 27 Total) Rate per 1,000 19 total (live & still) births 18.4 Total Death rate per 499 1.000 of the estimated population 7.5 Comparability Factor is 1,62 giving a corrected death rate of 12.5 Death rate for England and Wales 11.7 6 Death rate for County of Middlesex (corrected) 10.8 Deaths from puerperal causes 1.0 Maternal mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 total (live & still) births 1.0 Maternal mortality rate for County of Middlesex 0.6 Death rate of infants under one year of age: (a) All infants per 1,000 live births 14.8 (b) Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 15.4 (c) Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births Nil Death rate of infants under one year of age in the County of Middlesex 19.1 BIRTH AMI) DEATH RATES, ETC.

Harlington Cottage Hospital Sipson Lane Harlington for maternity cases. Beds are available at hospitals within a few miles of the district for the treatment of most conditions including mental disease and infectious disease. Ambulance Service This is provided by the Middlesex County Council for the conveyance of all cases to hospital and one ambulance is based in Hayes other ambulances operate from Hillingdon Hospital, Tuberculosis The number of new cases of tuberculosis notified in 1956 is slightly less than in 1955. Modern methods of treat ment are fully used in this area and are largely respon sible for the improvements in incidence and prognosis of this disease. The Chest Clinic is situated at the Local County Offices. Uxbridge and provision for treatment is made at Harefield Hospital Mount Pleasant Hospital Hillingdon Hospital and other places. Child Welfare Clinics etc There are numerous Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics in the district; these are administered by the Middlesex County Council and the services provided are available free of charge. Sessions are held regularly in clinic buildings and certain church halls. The mobile clinic now visits three districts in the area which are a long way from established clinics. Immunisation As forecast in my report last year the British anti poliomyelitis vaccine became available in the spring of 1956. and some children born in the months of March and 10 November in the years 1945 54 were inoculated in connection with Medical Research Council trials. The figures for this district alone are not available but in Area 8 (comprising Uxbridge Yiewsley and West Drayton Hayes and Harlington Ruislip and Northwood) 995 children received protection against poliomyelitis Vaccination will continue as further supplies of material become available. Vaccination against smallpox and immunisation against whooping cough diphtheria and tetanus have been carried out as before and the figures overleaf, kindly supplied by the Area Medical Officer show an increase over those for the previous year. As the immunisation programme was suspended for 2 months during both years these results are encouraging and bear tribute to the quiet but persistent persuasion exercised by the staff responsible for this work. I feel that discussion at every possible opportunity gives better results than an annual publicity campaign where the facts put forward are often forgotten by the public as soon as the newspaper page is turned or the feature film flashes onto the cinema screen. Water Supply The greater part of the district is supplied with water by the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Co. but a small area in the South is supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co. During the year 3 samples have been taken and all have proved of a satisfactory standard, Medical Examinations of Council Staff. The total number of examinations carried out during 1956 was 152. Of these 37 were for Superannuation purposes alone 26 for admission to the Councils Sick Pay Scheme 66 for Sick Pay and Superannuation and 23 for various special purposes. 11 TUBERCULOSIS New Cases and Mortality during the year, 1956 Age Periods New Cases Mortality Respiratory NonRespiratory Respiratory Non Respiratory M F M P M P M P Under 5 years - - 1 - - - - - 5-14 2 - 1 - - - - - 15 - 24 6 4 1 1 - - - - 25 - 44 10 10 1 1 - 1 - - 45 - 64 5 3 - 1 2 - - - 65 & over 4 - - - 2 - - - Age unknown - - - - - - - - Totals 27 17 4 3 4 1 - - TUBERCULOSIS 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 New Cases 109 101 88 73 59 51 Deaths 24 12 8 11 12 5 12 13 Age Number of Children Who Completed a Full Course of Primary Immunisation Number of Children Who Received a Secondary (Reinforcing) Injection Persons Vaccinated or Re- Vaccinated Diphtheria Only Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Whooping Co ugh Only Diphtheria Only Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough f/'ho oping Cough Only Vaccination Re- Vaccination Under 1 43 512 - - - - 517 - 1 16 204 - - - - 11 - 2-4 17 101 2 41 94 - 27 2 5-14 65 26 1 968 440 - 30 21 15 & Over - - - 3 2 - 42 172 TOTAL 141 843 3 1P12 536 - 627 195 TOTAL 1955 91 650 21 536 298 5 573 107 TOTAL 1954 176 777 34 848 187 8 584 279 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER THAN TU3ERCUL0SIS) DURING THE YEAR 1956 Disease Notified cases confirmed Deaths Scarlet Fever 88 - Whooping Cough 87 - Acute Poliomyelitis & Encephalitis 6 1 Measles 77 - Dysentery 14 - Meningococcal Infection 2 - Pneumonia 82 38 Erysipelas 4 - Food Poisoning 21 - Puerperal Pyrexia 9 - Enteric or Typhoid Fever 1 - INCIDENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Disease 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 Scarlet Fever 101 144 84 52 117 88 Pneumonia 95 79 101 42 6O 82 Diphtheria 0 0 0 0 0 0 Meningococcal Infection 1 4 2 0 1 2 Puerperal Pyrexia 20 16 12 6 6 9 Erysipelas Ophthalmia 4 2 7 8 6 4 Neonatorum 1 3 0 0 0 0 Measles 634 680 938 75 1,154 77 Whooping Cough 331 143 257 73 59 87 Dysentery Group 25 25 1 12 0 14 Poliomyelitis and Encephalitis 10 14 7 1 22 6 Food Poisoning 0 4 0 1 8 21 14 15 ANALYSTS OF TOTAL CASES Disease AT AGES Under 1 yr 1 2 3 4 5-9 10 -14 15-24 25 & over Age unknown TOTALS Scarlet Fever 2 1 7 7 14 42 9 4 2 - 88 Whooping Cough 4 6 7 10 12 42 2 - 1 3 87 Acute Poliomyelitis - - - 1 1 1 2 - - 5 Measles 8 9 13 2 23 16 2 2 2 - 77 Dysentery - - 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 14 Meningococcal Infection 1 - - - - 1 - - - - 2 Disease AT AGES Under 5 yrs. 5-14 15-44 45-64 65 & over Aqe unknown TOTALS Pneumonia 14 11 18 21 16 2 82 Encephalitis - 1 - - - - 1 Erysipelas - - - 4 - - 4 Food Poisoning 1 1 11 6 1 1 21 Puerperal Pyrexia - - 9 - - - 9 Enteric or Typhoid Fever - 1 - - - - 1 REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR I have the honour of presenting my seventh annual re port on the sanitary circumstances of the district. The change of designation from sanitary inspector to public health inspector which was brought about by the Sanitary Inspectors (Change of Designation) Act 1956 did not pass without comment from various interested sources. Some of this comment was good natured leg pull some arose from complete ignorance of the duties involved in the job and some from quarters where any improvement in the lot of the inspector appears to be resented. There can be no doubt however that although the new designation may not be ideal it gives a far more accurate idea to the general public of the range of the inspectors work than the old one did. There were fewer staff changes than in recent years and consequently the additional duties and responsibilities imposed by new legislation were absorbed without upsetting the normal routine of the department. The Pood Hygiene Regulations. 1955 came into force in part on the 1st January, 1956. and all the necessary inspections and surveys were made during the early months of the year. The routine inspection of dwelling houses which was discontinued two years ago due to staff shortages was recommenced. Unfor tunately however it was necessary to call a temporary halt to the clearance of unfit houses. Owing to procedural de lays in connection with several Clearance Areas a con siderable number of Orders became operative within a short space of time to the acute embarrassment of the Housing Committee. It is not expected that the clearance programme as a whole will be adversely affected by this set back and all unfit houses in the district should be cleared within the time originally scheduled. The Clean Air Act reached the Statute Book and parts of it including the power to declare Smoke Control Areas came into force on the 31st December. The opportunities offered by this Act could if accepted, have a more bene ficial effect on living conditions in the towns and cities of this country than any other piece of public health legis lation for many years. With hard work by the inspectorate unwavering support from the elected representatives, will ingness by the ratepayers to foot the bill and ever in 16 creasing efforts by the manufacturers of smokeless fuels it should become possible for Englishmen to breathe clean air without having to go to Scandinavia or Switzerland to do so. All aspects of the work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors were shown at the Annual Delegate Conference by means of a comprehensive display of photographs, charts, statistical tables and posters. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following five headings: - I. Sanitary Administration, viz: inspection of the district complaints,, notices served, legal proceedings., offensive trades, atmospheric pollution, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent control, ponds, ditches and watercourses, II. Pood, viz: milk supply, ice cream, inspection of meat and other foods, food hygiene, hawkers of food, sampling of food and drugs, food poisoning, inspection of food premises, III. Housing, viz: inspection, repair, demolition clos ure, overcrowding. Improvement Grants,.Certificates of Disrepair moveable dwellings, new houses, IV. Factories and Shops, viz inspection of factories defects found, outworkers, inspection of shops, V. Miscellaneous duties, viz Petroleum (Regulation) Acts, Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, Pet Animals Act. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN S. HODGINS. Chief Public Health Inspector. 17 PART I SANITARY ADMINISTRATION Inspection of the District.

(a) Food and Drugs Act 1955 Proceedings were taken against the occupier of a green grocers shop (a) for failure to keep the premises clean and (b) for failure to provide proper washing facilities. The defendant was fined £2 on the first charge and conditionally discharged upon payment of £1.1.0. costs on the second. (b) Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Proceedings were taken on two occasions against a local farmer for permitting land to be used by caravans. 19 The first time he was unconditionally discharged on payment of £5.5.0. costs and on the second occasion he was fined £3 and ordered to pay £3.3.0. costs. Offensive Trades. There is no establishment in the district carrying on an offensive trade. Atmospheric Pollution Although all industrial boiler plants were closely watched no contraventions of the Smoke Byelaws were recorded. This satisfactory state of affairs is the result of the great efforts which have been made by the inspectors in this district over a period of several years. On occasions when smoke in excess of the amount which need be emitted from an efficiently operated plant was seen discussions with the management of the factories concerned took place and usually led to improved operation of the plant. Certain provisions of the Clean Air Act 1956 including the power to establish Smoke Control Areas came into operation on the last day of the year. In anticipation of this welcome event the Council had previously approved in principle, the establishment of Smoke Control Areas in the district and agreed to my suggestions for their intro duction to be based on the following broad principles (1) That in order to safeguard the future the first areas to be declared should as far as poss ible include all the existing undeveloped land in the district. (2) That in order to introduce the idea of Smoke Control Areas as smoothly and at as little expense as possible those areas containing premises least likely to require alterations to firegrates etc. be selected before areas where extensive alterations are likely. On this basis dwelling houses would as far as possible be brought into Smoke Control Areas in the following order. (a) All premises constructed since 1st January 1956. (b) Council houses equipped with draught controlled grates. 20 (c) All post war privately built houses. (d) Council houses not included in (b) and owner/occupied houses constructed be tween 1919 and 1945. (e) The remaining private houses constructed between 1919 and 1945 and pre war Council houses. (f) All remaining premises. NOTE It should be understood that the above mentioned order of inclusion is no more than a flexible guide. It is probable that Smoke Control Areas will for geographical reasons often have to include premises out of sequence. (3) That Smoke Control areas should wherever poss ible be separated from uncontrolled areas by a belt of open space in order to avoid a situation arising where it would be an offence to emit smoke from a house on one side of the street but not on the other. (4) That Council owned premises should figure pro minently in the first Smoke Control Areas to be declared in order to demonstrate in the best possible way the Councils firm belief in clean air. Since the Clean Air Bill was first introduced all applicants for byelaw approval of new buildings have by arrangement with the Engineer and Surveyor been informed of the possible effect of this new legislation and been requested to instal at the outset grates boilers or furnaces capable of smokeless operation. By arrangement with the Estates Manager a special appeal was addressed to the tenants of all Council houses fitted with draught controlled firegrates pointing out the advantage of using smokeless fuels in these grates and asking them to use this type of fuel. The film Guilty Chimneys" was shown several times at the Town Fete, held in the Town Hall Park in June and the subject of clean air figured prominently in the display arranged at the Queens Hall in November in connection with the Annual Delegate Conference. 21 During the year, three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method were set up. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. The figures for sulphur dioxide are given below the figures for smoke are not given as it is thought that they are not sufficiently reliable to be of value. The method of measuring smoke involves the visual comparison between a stain caused by passing air through a filter paper and a standard scale of shades. As the texture 01 the filter paper is not the same as the paper on which the scale of shades is printed comparison is difficult and, to be accurate, requires considerable experience.

Pour cesspools and ten pail closets were abolished during the year leaving 61 cesspools and 33 pail closets still in use, In approximately half of these cases a sewer is available within a reasonable distance or likely to be • come available in the near future. The Council make a 50% contribution the maximum grant permissible under Section 47 of the Public Health Act 1936, where owners of premises provide a water closet in place of a pail closet and are also prepared to undertake the work of connecting the drains to the sewer from premises with cesspools, if the owners agree to pay half the cost. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer and Surveyors De partment. The practice of clearing stopped drains free'of charge was continued and nuisances from this cause thereby reduced to a minimum. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under Section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs horses and cattle are in force. The byelaws deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, the storage of manure, boiling of swill, drainage etc , and have proved of considerable assistance to the Public Health Inspectors in their efforts to minimise nuisances from this source. In view of the suspicion which has fallen on flies in the spread of poliomyelitis these additional powers of control over premises which are particularly liable to in festation are useful and necessary. Uodent Control. Treatment at dwelling houses is carried out free, but a charge based on the cost of labour and materials is made for treatment at business and industrial premises. All complaints are investigated by the Public Health Inspectors before treatment is carried out in order to find out whether the infestation is the result of defective drains, accu mulations of refuse, improper keeping of animals etc. Ditches, undeveloped sites, rubbish dumps and other places 23 where infestation is likely to occur, are subject to regular routine inspection. During the year 251 treatments were carried out at dwelling houses and 205 at business premises. Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses; Etc. These sites are regularly inspected for rodent infestation pollution, general nuisances and, particularly in summer mosquitoes. When adverse conditions are found remedial action is taken. PART II. FOOD. Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are: Milk Distributors 21 Dairies 8 The following licences have been issued: Designation Dealers Licences Supplementary Licences Tuberculin Tested 11 10 Pasteurised 12 10 Sterilised 17 12 An order made under Section 23 of the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950: specifying this district as one within which the use of special desig nations in relation to milk sold by retail is compulsory, is in force. During the year twelve samples of pasteurised mi1 k were taken for bacteriological examination; all passed the Phosphatase test but two failed to pass the Methylene Blue test and were referred to the licensing authority, the Middlesex County Council, 24 In addition seven samples of raw milk were taken in the district by officers of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli all gave negative results. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations 1949 to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream One hundred and nine persons are registered for the sale of ice cream in the district including fifteen who are registered for its manufacture. All the latter use methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations. A new method of testing ice cream has been adopted by the Public Health Laboratory Ealing, where all samples from this area are taken for bacteriological examination. A plate count test and faecal coli test have been substitu ted for the methylene blue test and the following provisional grades set up. Grade Count Faecal Coli I II III IV below 500 5 00 10 000 20 000 100 000 over 100 000 0 0 0 or Present In practice this test was found to be much more exact ing than the old one dual tests showed that samples which achieved Grade I under the Methylene Blue test often fell into Grade IV under the new tests and that gradings in gen eral were considerably lower than had been experienced in previous years. As a result more attention was given by the Public Health Inspectors to the methods of manufacture and storage of ice cream than would have been the case if the gradings had been up to usual standards and gradually the bacteriological quality, as measured by the plate count faecal coli tests, was improved. Of the 15 samples (ice cream and ice lollies) which were placed in Grade IV, 8 were taken in July 3 in August, 2 in September and 2 in 25 October. The grading of all samples of ice cream and ice lollies based on the plate count and faecal coli tests as described above, was as follows: Ice Cream Lollies Grade I 13 Grade I 18 " II 36 " II – III 11 „III 1 " IV 10 " IV 5 All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water soap towels and nail brushes. The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods The two licensed slaughterhouses in use are proving more than adequate for the needs of the district. Details of the animals slaughtered and diseases found are set out on page 27. The inspection of meat in slaughterhouses which is carried out to the standards laid down in Memo. 3/Foods resulted in the condemnation of 693 pounds of carcase meat and 260 pounds of offal whilst in retail shops 547 pounds of raw meat and 2.633 pounds of tinned meat were condemned. In addition over 12 tons of corned beef were condemned at a Government Buffer Depot. The following foods (other than meat) were also con demned during the year. Cheese 3.223 lbs. Eggs 15 doz. Fish 108 lbs. Fish (tinned) 8 lbs. Frozen foods 23 lbs. Sandwich Spread 406 lbs. Fruit (dried) 1,958 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 14 722 lbs. Bacon 18 lbs. Milk and Cream (tinned) 139 lbs. Tomato Puree, etc. (tinned) 2,987 lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 425 lbs. Miscellaneous tinned or bottled food 95 lbs.

In November the Council submitted for approval to the Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food draft byelaws relating to sanitary conditions and management of private slaughterhouses. These followed closely the Model byelaws but strengthened them by making provision for (a) hanging accommodation outside the slaughtering or dressing room (b) covered accommodation for the storage of manure (c) the taking of all reasonable precautions to prevent access by domestic birds or animals not intended for slaughter into the slaughterhouses. The draft, as submitted, was provi sionally approved in December and formal application made for confirmation. Food Hygiene The hygienic standard of premises equipment and plant used in the preparation of food has again improved during the year mainly due to the additional requirements of the new Food Hygiene Regulations most of which came into force on the 1st January. A summary of the Regulations was supplied to all food traders and also posters for the atten tion of their employees. All premises to which the Regula tions applied were inspected and the occupiers notified of the matters which would require attention to bring their premises up to the new standards 256 such notifications were served and at the end of the year all but 29 had been complied with. The number of items of improvement dealt with was 522 details of which are given on page 31 the corresponding figure for last year was 94. It would be good to be able to report that improvement in standards of food handling had kept pace with the structural standards of food premises but although some progress has been made there is still much to do in this direction. All food pre mises were visited on average seven times during the year and the opportunity was taken on these occasions to discuss all aspects of food hygiene with the occupiers and staff particularly points involving personal hygiene. 23 Propaganda posters and photographs were exhibited on the Councils notice boards in all parts of the district and were also supplied to local food factories and other food traders. The new film Food Without Fear prepared by the Milton Deosan Co. Ltd. was shown at the Civic Restau rant to an audience of 40 people (nearly 400 invitations were issued) and on another occasion to 350 employees of the Kraft Foods Co. Food hygiene figured prominently in the display on health topics shown at the annual Delegate Conference. Byelaws made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act. 1938 have been in force in the district since July. 1950. The Food Hygiene Guild, in its present form was made redundant by the new Food Hygiene Regulations which laid down standards for food premises higher than those specified in the Guilds Codes of Practice. Therefore if the Guild is to remain in existence and continue the good work it has done since its inception in 1949 new codes of practice will have to be adopted. Consideration has not yet been given to this matter by the Guild because it is understood that new Codes are in course of preparation by the Food Hygiene Division of the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and it is felt that these should form the foundation on which to build new Codes for the Guild. It is to be hoped that their publication will not be delayed much longer. Havkers of Food The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and immed iately after the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950 came into force the Council adopted Section 11 of the Act to extend the registration of hawkers to cover all classes of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Food Hygiene Regulations. 29 Sampling of Food and Drugs (a) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analy sis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control Officer 250 samples were taken including 131 of milk 23 (22 of which were milk) were found to be un satisfactory. All cases except one were dealt with by cautions. In this case successful proceedings were taken, (b) Miscellaneous foods such as shell fish cream cakes watercress and meat products are regularly sampled by the Public Health Inspectors for bacteriological examina tion and the results are of considerable assistance to them in their contacts with food handlers illustrating as they often do that the greatest care is necessary in the storage and handling of this class of food. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk ice cream water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory Ealing I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respec tive headings. Food Poisoning Six cases of food poisoning were notified during the year four due to Salmonella typhi-murium and two to Shigella sonnei. There was also one outbreak (due to Salmonella typhi murium) involving 15 members of the Hayes and Harlington Athletic Club immediately upon their return from a trip to Germany. All the available evidence pointed to the out break having been caused by a meal taken by the party on the train from Hamburg to Hook of Holland. The German health authorities were notified and given all the details of the outbreak. 30 Inspection of Food Premises (a) Inspections Premises Total Number in District Inspections made Restaurants and Cafes 93 730 Ice Cream Dealers and Manufacturers 109 493 Licensed premises 39 134 Dairies and Milk Distributors premises 29 88 Preserved Food premises 59 309 Bakehouses 15 110 Butchers shops 34 366 Grocers shops 73 661 Fish shops 16 148 Greengrocers shops 34 360 Food Hawkers premises 8 21 Mobile canteens 4 9 31 (j) Defects remedied Total Cleanliness improved 92 Structural repairs 54 Lighting improved 19 Ventilation improved 4 Equipment improved 41 Hot water supplies improved 60 Clean towels provided 29 Food storage accommodation improved 15 Rodent infestations abated 4 Sanitary accommodation provided or improved 18 Sinks provided or renewed 42 Other improvements 144 PART III, HOUSING Due to the circumstances mentioned in the introduction to this report, the Council, in October suspended for a period of six months their programme for the clearance of unfit houses. It was however found possible to resume the routine inspection of houses under the Housing and Public Health Acts and 313 visits were made for this purpose. Arising from this work 88 notices were served for repairs and the abatement of nuisances. Inspection of Houses during the year 1. (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 470 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 2,100 2.

(a) Closing Orders made under Section 10(1) 2 (b) Number of dwellings closed 2 Overcrowding. The figure of overcrowded premises given in previous reports has always been arrived at by adding new cases to the previous year's total and deducting the cases known to have been abated. During the year a check was made of all premises shown on our records as being overcrowded and it was found that the number actually overcrowded was much smaller than had been assumed. . At the end of the year 31 dwellings were overcrowded, i.e. 0.17% of the total dwellings in the district. The average number of occupants for each inhabited house in the district is now 3.50, the lowest since 1939 when the figure was 3.44. This figure, together with those given in the previous paragraph, shows that overcrowding is not a serious problem in the district. Improvement Grants. The increased interest reported last year in this method of modernising dwelling houses has not been 34 tained and only one application was received during the year a grant of 50% of the cost of improvements was made. Certificates of Disrepair It is evident that the conditions laid down in the Housing Repairs & Rents Act 1954 for increasing the rent of dwelling houses have not proved acceptable to property owners in this district Since the Act came into force only 52 applications for Certificates of Disrepair have been received and last year there were none at all During the year one application for revocation of a Certificate was received but was not granted. "toveable Dwellings. It is five years since I first referred in these reports to the proposed municipal caravan site. Construe tionofthe site was commenced in October and when completed should compare favourably with any in the country. It will accommodate 95 vans and all will have an impervious standing there will be proper roads and paths to all parts of the site no van will be more than 100 ft. from a water supply and slop disposal point and the ablution block will contain water closets wash basins baths and deep sinks for laundry purposes. On completion of the site it is the Councils in tention to take action to close the existing unauthorised sites which represent from a sanitary and public health point of view some of the district s most unsatisfactory features. New Houses. During the year 1956 the following dwellings were completed by the Council and private developers Council Houses 39 Old Persons dwellings Plats 74 Maisonettes 6 Private Development Dwellings 322 35 PART IV. FACTORIES AND SHOPS Factories Act, 1937. There are one hundred and sixty five factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including: Aircraft, building materials, caravans, carbon products, cheese, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, electrical transformers, furniture, lubricating oil, optical lenses, potato crisps, radio, radar, television, gramophone records and gramophones, rubber, tarmacadam, and wood block floors.

Outworkers. Part VIII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons to carry out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months Ninety one noti fications were received and 194 inspections made in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops Act All parts of the Shops Act are administered including hours of closing assistants half holiday Sunday trading comfort and welfare of assistants, etc, The Act applies to 599 premises in the district and the Public Health Inspectors made 3 230 visits including 1 872 outside normal office hours i.e. in the evenings and on Sundays. As a result 24 informal notices were served but in no instance was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises is held in the Public Health Department. PART V MISCELLANEOUS. Petroleum (Regulation) Acts These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but 37 to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide. During the year 107 licences were issued in respect of:- 105,725 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures. 45,005 gallons of cellulose solutions, 5,824 lbs. of calcium carbide, 330 gallons of other oils. The Council have adopted the latest recommendations of the Home Office for the electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps and this work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified officer in the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The shortage of petrol arising from the Suez crisis in the Autumn of the year resulted in the illegal storage of petrol in domestic garages on a fairly wide scale. Six cases were reported to the Public Health Committee but as only small quantities of petrol were involved and there were also other mitigating circumstances the matters were dealt with by cautionary letters. During the year 263 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and ten minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstery is carried out at several premises in the district all but one on account of the type of filling used, fall outside the scope of the Act. These premises are registered and were visited twice during the year. The other premises used for upholstery and similar trades are also visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and a type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted".Such appliances 38 are sold at 24 shops in the district and 17 visits were made to these premises by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act, Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Pour premises are licensed under the Act and 23 visits were made by Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the licence. No contraventions were found. 39
