The London County Council, as Local Health Authority, is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the provision of ambulance facilities within the Administrative County of London. The Home Service Ambulance Department (Order of St. John of Jerusalem and British Red Cross Society) and the Hospital Car Service act as agents of the County Council in supplying some of the ambulance and car transport provided under the Act. The Headquarters of the London Ambulance Service are at The County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.I. Ambulances may be summoned as follows: — (1) Accidents— Sudden illness in the streets, public places or places of employment. (Note—For sudden illness in the home a doctor, not an ambulance, should be summoned.) Dial " 999 " (or follow the instructions given on the telephone instrument) and ask for— "AMBULANCE." (2) Maternity patients (who have booked a bed in a hospital or maternity home)— Very urgent illness in the home (provided a medical practitioner certifies that the case is one of life or death and arrangements have been made with a hospital for the patient's admission). Telephone— WATerloo 6000 CENtral 6301 REGent 4000 RELiance 3622 or NEW Cross 2645. 10 (3) Illness, infectious disease, etc.— Normally the hospital to which the patient is to be admitted will summon the ambulance, if one is necessary, by telephoning WATerloo 33]]. This applies also to patients being discharged from hospital or attending there as out-patients. Emergency Bed Service. (King Edward's Hospital Fund for London). The Emergency Bed Service was founded in 1938 to assist general practitioners in finding beds for acute emergency cases. Since the 5th July, 1948, the Service, working in close co-operation with the Ambulance Service, has acted as agent for the four Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards for the admission of all types of cases except mental and tuberculous. The Central Office of the Emergency Bed Service removed from Old Jewry to 28, London Bridge Street, S.E.I, on 1st June, 1954, and the telephone number was changed from MONarch 3000 to HOP 7181. On the 8th June, 1954, the branch offices were closed and all calls are now made direct to Central Office. 11 SECTION 2. Births and Deaths. STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1953. Population.

The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last eight years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that these neoplasms produce a wastage of life practically equal to that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 17 SECTION 3.

Notifications. During the year 366 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 63 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 20). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1922-1953 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 22 and 23). Diphtheria. It is very gratifying to report that for the third year in succession no case of diph theria was notified. Dysentery. Eight cases were notified and one was removed to hospital. Encephalitis. One case of post vaccinial encephalitis was notified and was removed to hospital. Enteric Fever. One case of typhoid fever was notified and was removed to hospital. The patient was one of a party of American students who had been touring Europe, and had arrived in England only two days prior to the patient's admission to hospital. Erysipelas. One case was notified and was treated at home. Food Poisoning. Two cases were notified, one of which was removed to hospital. In addition, two cases of suspected food poisoning were notified, both of which were nursed at home. Malaria. One primary case of benign tertian malaria was notified and was removed to hospital. The patient had been resident in Karachi up to four months before the date of onset, and had travelled extensively in Europe in the intervening period. It was therefore problematical as to where the infection had been acquired. Measles. One hundred and ninety-five cases were notified and fifteen were removed to hospital. Two cases removed to hospital were subsequently re-diagnosed, one as chicken-pox and the other as coryza. Meningococcal Infection. Two cases were notified and were removed to hospital. 19 Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Three cases were notified and were treated in hospital. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal). Four cases were notified, and two were removed to hospital. Poliomyelitis. Seventeen cases were notified, all of which were removed to hospital. Only two of these cases were Holborn residents. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re diagnosed as upper respiratory tract infection. Puerperal Pyrexia. No cases were notified during the year. ScABIBS. Six cases were notified, all of which were treated at home. Scarlet Fever. Ten cases were notified, and three of them were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as allergic reaction. Smallpox. In March a ship arrived at Southampton from Bombay having had a case of smallpox on board. The patient had been removed to hospital at Gibraltar. Twenty-one passengers presumed to be contacts were kept under observation for a period of sixteen days. Also in March ten persons believed to have been contacts of cases in the Todmor den outbreak were kept under observation for a period of sixteen days. Tuberculosis. See page 51. Whooping Cough.

The Borough Council provides bacteriological confirmation of diagnosis tree of charge in connection with certain diseases. This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.I, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 67 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results: — Disease. Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria — 30 30 (Nasal and throat swabs) Dysentery (Faeces) 3 12 15 (Faecal swabs) 3 5 8 Salmonella typhi-murium — 1 1 (Faeces). Streptococcus haemolyticus 2 — 2 Tuberculosis — 1 1 (Sputum).

Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carriei or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox. The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 239 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 220 were in respect of smallpox, 16 for cholera, 2 for typhoid, and one for tuberculosis. 22 23 TABLE No. 7. Comparative Figures of Infectious Disease for the Years 1922-1953.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. No complaints, regarding unsatisfactory water being supplied for drinking purposes, were received during the year. Drainage. During the year 3,044 inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 92 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 88 Combined Drainage Orders were made Smoke Abatement. During the year 27 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 243 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Sanitary Inspectors. In one case it was found necessary to serve a Notice under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Bombed Sites. Accumulations of refuse on bombed sites present a considerable problem to local authorities. In very few cases are the accumulations such as to warrant the service of notice in respect of a " nuisance and there is also the difficulty of assessing responsibility for the accumulations. In 1949 the Council made a by-law governing fly tipping on vacant sites in the Borough, but considerable difficulty is experienced in tracing offenders. Sites cleared by Council, e.g., bedding removed18 Sites cleared as a result of the service of notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 3 War-Time Reservoirs for Emergency Water Supplies. During the year it was agreed by the Home Office that the cost of cleansng emergency water tanks should rank for 75% grant under the Civil Defence Act, 1948, the remaining 25% of the cost to be borne by the London County Council as fire authority. I It was also agreed that the work of cleansing might be done by the Metropolitan Borough Councils as agents for the London County Council. As a result of this arrangment eight emergency water tanks in Holborn were cleansed during the year. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act, the Poisons Rules, 1952/54, and the Poisons List Order, 1952/54, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1953, 32 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. Two applications were received for entrv on the list. 29 Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed. Five premises in the Borough are registered under the Act, but no premises are licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock. Housing Acts, 1936 and 1949.

A person proposing to use a special designation authorised by the Regulations is required to apply to the licensing authority of the area in which the milk is to be sold, for a licence to use the designation. Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area rrom which the designated milk is to be sold.

The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows: — Grade 1 35 Grade 2 9 Grade 3 2 Grade 4 1 Three coloured ices and four iced lollies did not respond to the test. These samples were examined for the presence of faecal coli, which in one case were found to be present, and in the other three cases absent, in 1 ml. of the sample. In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading.

The campaign for the early detection of Tuberculosis was continued during the year by Mass X-Ray Unit II of the North-West Regional Hospital Board. Facilities were afforded to persons living or working in Holborn for X-ray examination of the chest during July, September and October. A large number of firms in the Borough were invited to allow their employees to undergo examination by the Unit, and the managements proved very co-operative. Once again the total number of volunteers from Holborn examined was larger than on any previous occasion. The following are particulars giving the results of the examinations: — Analysis of Survey of Persons Living or Working in the Borough.
