To The Worshipful The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington. Dear Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, In presenting you with the Sixtieth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health, which deals with the health and sanitary state of your borough for 1915, as well as with other matters appertaining to them, 1 regret that I am not able to congratulate you either on an increased birth-rate or a decreased death-rate, for unfortunately the former has never been so low since the registration of births became compulsory nor the latter so high since 1896. Consequently, the natural increase in the population, which was only 5 69 per 1,000 inhabitants, has never been so low. It has been steadily growing less since 1870-80, when it was 16.32 per 1,000 of the inhabitants. It is this ever diminishing figure, not only in Islington but throughout the Kingdom, that makes infant life so valuable and has prompted the Government to call on Local Authorities to use every effort to stop the great wastage that is everywhere taking place. The call has not been in vain, for, as you have been told by the President of the Local Government Board, nearly all of them are responding to it. I regret very much that Islington is not enrolled among them, although I feel confident the time is not far distant when it, too, will be found doing its utmost to save those lives which are so necessary for carrying on the work of the nation in the next generation. There are also strong humanitarian reasons why public authorities should not allow these infants to be sacrificed, especially as many of the preventable and curable diseases from which they die are characterized by most excruciating pain. The Council, I trust, will perceive that public health work does not finish with what is popularly known vii. as sanitation,—a word which is wrongly thought to embrace only nuisances and the like—but that in the era which opened with the twentieth century it also seriously concerns itself with the persons who have been attacked as well as with the diseases themselves, so that the patients may be cured and the diseases prevented. In the last few years sanitary authorities have been asked to interest themselves in infantile diseases, and in tuberculosis, and before this report appears in print they or the London County Council will probably be called on to unite with other authorities in mitigating the evil results of those so-called social diseases—the extent of which is scarcely recognised—which for years have been sapping the vitals of the people. I am anxious that your Borough shall play its part in this modern public health work, which some years ago I told you was approaching. It will most certainly result in preventing disease and death and in ensuring a stronger and healthier race, on whose shoulders will rest the burden of that great Empire which will be their heritage. With regard to child sickness and mortality, you have been told that this is a work which should be undertaken by philanthropic agencies. I must remind the Council, however, that a very great deal has been, and is being, done by them by means of general hospitals, children's hospitals, maternity and child welfare centres, creches, and similar agencies, which are practically, if not entirely, supported by voluntary funds. Nevertheless, Sanitary Authorities have their part to perform, and that is to assist mothers to get into touch with these agencies at the right time, whether before or after the birth of their children, so that they may derive advantage from them ; and also to provide instructors so that mothers may be taught how best to nurse and rear their children, to prepare food for them and to arrange their homes, and, in fact, to do many things which, combined, might well be called home hygiene. It would enable parents, and especially young parents, to bring up children on wholesome food and in healthy homes. Believe me, such instruction would contribute largely to diminish sickness and mortality among infants and young children. It could best be given by health visitors, who up to now— although sorely needed—have been lacking in Islington. I am, Your faithful servant, July lst, 1916. Medical Officer of Health. viii.

Population, 316,242—The population of Islington, on which the mortality rates are based, has usually been estimated on the assumption that the rate of increase or decrease during the preceding inter-censal period had continued; but in view of the fall in the rate of natural increase since 1911, and an increased loss of men of military age by migration owing to the war, the Registrar-General has found it impossible to adhere to the methods of estimation of local populations hitherto in use. In these circumstances it was found that estimates based on the census returns were inadmissible, and, therefore, the Registrar-General has thought it necessary to find a substitute for them in the National Register Returns made on August 15th, 1915, which refer to a date only six weeks removed from that for which the estimates were required viz.:—the middle of the year 1915. By these returns it was possible to derive an estimate of the civil population of each administrative area. No attempt has, however, been made to increase these by making an allowance for members of the fighting forces, owing to the difficulty of ascertaining the average military population of each district during the year. In present circumstances, only civilian deaths are tabulated; and, therefore, in this report it is proposed to limit the tabulation of deaths to those of civilians, and to calculate the death rates on the Registrar-General's estimated civil population of the borough for 1915 (310,242), which is based on the returns of the National Register above mentioned. The population used for the calculation of the Birth-rate, however, is . based upon the existing estimates for 1914; as the births registered are not 2 1915] only those of the children of civilians; and, therefore, the estimate of the civil population would form an unsuitable basis for the calculation of birthrates. It is obvious in existing circumstances that the estimated population of the borough is hypothetical and liable to serious error, owing to extensive migration having occurred, so that beyond the total rates, it is not proposed to give the birth and death rates of the Wards and Sub-Registration districts.

Marriages, 4,252; Marriage Rate. 26-12.—The number of persons married was 8,504, as contrasted with 6,376 in the preceding year, which is an increase of 2,128; and the marriage rate per thousand inhabitants was 26.12, as compared with 19.59 in 1914. The rate is a phenomenal one for Islington, and was undoubtedly due to the large number of war marriages contracted throughout the year. The nearest approach to it was 19.77 in 1865, while the rate in 1914 was 19.59, which was also due to the war. The following statement shows the figures for the decennial average 1902-1911, and for 1912, 191-3, 1914 and 1915. 3 [1915 Persons married, decennial average,) 1902- 1911 ) 5,856 17.71 per 1,000 inhabitants ,, in 1912 6,182 18 94 ,, ,, in 1913 5,968 17.98 ,, ,, in 1914 6,376 19.59 ,, ,, in 1915 8,504 2612 ,, Table II.

BIRTHS. Births, 7.537; Birth Rate, 23.15.—Of this number 133 births occurred in districts outside the borough, which were transferred by the Registrar-General to Islington, where the parents resided. The number of births actually registered in the borough was 7,404, as contrasted with 8,0(i0 in the preceding year. The birth-rate, inclusive of the transferred births, was 23.15 per 1,000 inhabitants, which is the actual birth-rate of the borough. The rate arising from the births registered in the district was 22.74 per thousand, whilst the return in 1914 was 24.82. These figures are considerably below those registered in past years, and the birth-rate for the 4 1915] year 1915 is the lowest hitherto recorded. It is seen in the succeeding statement that in the decennial periods from: — 1841—1850 the birth rate averaged 28.65 1851—1860 do. 34.54 1861—1870 do. 37.20 1871—1880 do. 36.60 1881—1890 do. 32.49 1891—1900 do. 29.31 1901—1910 do. 26.36 Table III.

Illegitimate Births, 271—The number of illegitimate births shows a decrease of 33 as contrasted with 1914, and is 20 below that registered in 1913; it is equal to a rate of 3.59 per cent. of the total births. The number of illegitimate births in the borough since 1841 is shown in the following statement: — Periods. Illegitimate births. total births.

The Notification of Births.—6,483 Notifications were received, and represent 86 per cent. of the total number of births registered. These are a decrease of 638 on the return for 1914. In the preceding years the figures were as follows:— Births. Notifications. Failures to notify. Per cent. notified.

The following statement shows by whom the notifications were made since the Act came into operation:— 7 [1915  By Medical Practitioners. By Midwives. By Parents and other Persons.

In 62 instances the mother was attended by a midwife. In 19 instances the mother was attended by persons other than a doctor or midwife. In 174 instances no information could be obtained for the reasons which follow:— Information refused. Wrong address on certificates. Futile calls. Removal from the house since birth of child. Death of child before registration. Stillborn Births, 133. — There were probably more stillborn births than this figure indicates as there is no doubt that all such births were not notified to the Medical Officer of Health by the persons legally responsible. The following return shows by whom the notifications were made:— Stillborn Births. 1915. Doctors. Notified by Certified Midwives. Others.

Deaths, 5,523*; Death Rate, 17.46.—The death-rate of the borough was the highest recorded during the past 15 years. It was also 2.62 above the mean decennial rate (14.84) for the years 1905-14. The causes of the increased mortality will be found on page 12, under the heading of "Classified Causes of Death"; where it is seen that the deaths were 831 above the decennial average. The ages at which there was an increased number of deaths are given in Table VII (p. 11). The death-rate is above that of London in which it was 161 per 1,000, and also of the Great Towns, wherein it was 15.6. The highest mortality occurred in the first quarter of the year, when the deaths numbered 1,768, and were equal to an annual death-rate of 22.36 per 1,000 of the civil population, while the lowest was recorded in the third quarter, 1,038 deaths, when the death-rate was 13.3 per 1,000 annually.

Infant Deaths, 805; Mortality Rate, 107—The deaths of 805 infants under one year old were registered during the year, representing an infant mortality rate of 107 per thousand infants born. This rate is 2 per 1,000 below the mean annual record of the preceding 10 years, and is 3 per 1,000 above the rate of 1914; whereas it equalled that of 1913; while it was 21 per 1,000 births in excess of the mortality of 1912, when the rate was 86 per 1,000 births. The mortality in the registration sub-districts ranged from 65 per 1,000 births in Tufnell, to 135 in Tollington, which district frequently exhibits high rates. Thus in 1905 it was 117; in 1906, 127; in 1907, 132; and in 1911, 131, while the mean decennial rate was 109. An examination of the subsequent Table shows that in Tollington, Upper Holloway, Lower Holloway, Barnsbury and Islington South East, the average rates are far too high. Attention is also drawn to Table XIII., which proves that an enormous mortality occurs in the earlier weeks of the infants' lives, which are largely due to causes which are preventable, if only the mothers could be reached before as well as after, the births of their children, so as to instruct them or to put them in touch with the philanthropic institutions of the borough or of the metropolis, where they would have the benefit of such medical or other assistance that they required. This can be done by Health Visitors, and is one of the many reasons why the Council is invited by the Government to appoint them. 14 1915] TABLE IX.

There it will be seen that a very large proportion of them had never been fed at their mother's breast; for during the last seven years, only 17, or 20 per cent., of the 85 infants under three months old, were properly fed; while out of 232 children under six months old, only 31, or 13.3 per cent., were breast fed.

Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fevers ("Typhus, Enteric and Continued) and Diarrhœal Diseases. Four hundred and fifty deaths were registered during the year, which were equal to an annual death-rate of 142 per 1,000 of the civil population, as contrasted with 422, and a death-rate of 1.33 per 1,000 in the ten years immediately preceding. As compared with the year 1914, the number of deaths was 15 in excess, and showed an increase in the death-rate of 0 08 per 1,000. A return, giving the record of deaths from the principal epidemic diseases for the last 30 years is attached, from which it is seen that notwithstanding the almost continuous fall from 3.69 per 1,000 in 1885, to 0.97 in 1913; the last two years exhibit a slight rise in the death-rates for those periods, viz: 1.34 in 1914 to 1.42 in 1915. Yet when taking the corrected average number of deaths during 1885-1914, the past year shows a decrease of 208 on the thirty years average. In London the total epidemic deaths represented a death-rate of 1.57 per 1,000 of the population, while in the Encircling Boroughs it was 1.52 per 1,000. 23 [1915 Table XVI.

Pulmonary Phthisis, Tabes Mesenterica, Tubercular Meningitis, Tuberculosis of the Larynx, General Tuberculosis, and other forms of Tuberculosis, such as Lupus, Tuberculous Caries, and Pott's Disease. These diseases were responsible for 631 deaths, a number considerably in excess of those registered during the past ten years, being 65 above the average for that period. The deaths represent 1.99 per 1,000 of the civil population, and 114 per cent. of the deaths from all causes during the year. 1915] 34 It is significant that notwithstanding the increase in the number of deaths yet the actual notified cases of the disease fell to 944 from 1,150 in the preceding year. The number of deaths from tuberculosis in each year for the preceding ten years has been as follows:— Year. Deaths.

Under the Provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Principal Diseases Comprise:— Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup Enteric or Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Erysipelas, Continued Fever, Relapsing Fever and Cholera. There were 2,210 cases of these diseases which are notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, but in addition to them there are other infectious diseases, such as Tuberculosis, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Acute Poliomyelitis, and Cerebro-Spinal Fever, which are notifiable either under Orders of the Local Government Board or of the London County Council with the approval of that Board. The total cases notified are 737 below those of the previous year (2,947), but are 170 above the average of the preceding ten years. The greatest increases when contrasted with the decennial averages are to be found in the returns from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, which was respectively 142 and 126 in excess, while Puerperal Fever also showed an increase of 3. Enteric Fever and Erysipelas, however, showed decreases of 58 and 42 cases respectively; and Small Pox of 1 case. The 2,210 cases equalled an attack-rate of 6.98 per 1,000 of the civil population. In London the attack-rate was 6.82 per 1,000 or 0.16 less than in Islington, while in the Encircling Boroughs it was 7.17, or 0.19 more than here.

Twenty-eight cases of Enteric Fever were notified, which is a decrease of 58 on the average of the ten years 1905-14, and are equal to an attack-rate of 0.09 per 1,000 of the civil population. This return is the lowest hitherto recorded, and the following statement shows the periodical decreases that have occurred in the notifications of this disease:— From 1891—1895 there were 1,088 cases notified. „ 1896—1900 „ 1,334 ,, „ 1901—1905 „ 894 ,, „ 1906—1910 „ 522 ,, „ 1911—1915 „ 276 ,, The notifications of the disease in the encircling boroughs is given in the following statement:— Cases St. Pancras 28 Stoke Newington 4 Hackney 39 Hornsey 18 Finsbury 6 Shoreditch 22 Islington 28 Hospital Isolation—Twenty-three, or 82.1 per cent. of the 28 cases notified were removed to Hospital for isolation: the remaining 5 cases were treated at home. Fatality.—As five deaths occurred from the disease, the fatality is 17.8 per cent., which is a decrease of 0.6 per cent. on the return for 1914. The fatality among the cases nursed in Hospital was 13 per cent., and of those treated at home 40 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. No case was known. 54 1915] ERYSIPELAS. Two hundred and three cases were ascribed to Erysipelas, which represented an attack-rate of 0.64 per 1,000 of the civil population. When compared with the decennial average, the return shows a decrease of 42 cases. The highest number of cases occurred in Islington South-East sub-district, from which 66 were notified; the disease was also prevalent in Highbury and Upper Holloway, in which there were 31 and 30 cases respectively. Hospital Isolation—Fifty-nine cases, or 29.1 per cent. of the 203 cases notified were removed to or occurred in hospitals, whilst 144 remained at home Fatality.—The 11 deaths represented a fatality rate of 5.4 per cent., which is 0.6 per cent lower than that of the preceding year. PUERPERAL FEVER. Twenty-three cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, or two less than in 1914. The average for the preceding ten years 1905-14, was 20. Hospital Isolation.—Sixteen cases, or 69.5 per cent., were isolated in hospital, while the remaining 7 cases were treated at home. Fatality.—The deaths numbered 8, which represented a fatality of 34.8 per cent. The deaths, occurring in hospital numbered 7, and equalled a fatality rate of 43.7 per cent., while of those nursed at home one died, which was equal to 14.3 per cent. Tufnell Upper Holloway.

In ten instances it was noted that the patients had been in direct contact with soldiers recently returned from military camps, while two patients were Army men; but it cannot be proved, however much it may be suspected, that they (the soldiers) were the source of the infection. A return of the cases of the disease since it became notifiable is given in the following statement:— 1907. 1908. 1909 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914. 1915. Total Cases 1907-15.

This inflammatory disease of the eyes of infants was notified in 40 instances, of which 33 were forwarded by members of the medical profession, and 7 by midwives, and as a result 24 cases were referred to hospitals for treatment, while 16 were attended to in their homes, of which 20 were cared for by nurses. There can be no doubt that this early notification has been of great benefit to the children, and will be the means of preventing much blindness among them. Tufnell. Upper Hollowatf. Tollington.

Tuberculosis. During the year 994 cases of Tuberculosis in its different forms were notified. The attack-rate was equal to 3.14 per 1,000 of the civil population. In 1914 the number was 1,150, and the attack-rate 3.54 per 1,000. Thus the notable decrease in the notifications remarked on last year, when they were 533 less than in 1913, is again markedly continued in 1915; though to a much less extent, viz.: 156. Pulmonary Phthisis.—780 cases were ascribed to Pulmonary Phthisis, of which 444 were males and 336 females, and represented an attack-rate equal to 2.46 per 1,000 of the civil population. The cases notified during the year were 180 less than in 1914, while they were 523 below the number received in 1913. The incidence of the disease was greatest in South-East Islington, where 258 cases were known. Barnsbury came next with 173 cases; Highbury followed with 127 cases; while Tollington gave the lowest return with 87 cases.

Nine hundred and seventy-six cases of the notifiable infectious diseases, or 44.2 per cent. of all the cases notified under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; occurred among the scholars attending the Public Elementary Schools of the borough, of which 708 were Scarlet Fever, 267 Diphtheria and 1 Enteric Fever. These contrast with a ten years' average of 899 scholars and a percentage of 44.1 of the total cases notified. Table XXXVII.

Six thousand two hundred and eight cases of those Infectious Diseases, which are not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were reported by the school teachers to the Medical Officer of Health, and of these 1,897 were Measles, 1,012 Chicken Pox, 724 Whooping Cough, and 2,575 various other diseases. 63 [1915 The return contrasts with an average of 5,024 in the preceding 10 years, of which 1,568 were Measles, 756 Chicken Pox, and 660 Whooping Cough, while 2,040 related to various other infections. The record for Measles was 329 more than the decennial average, while, Chicken Pox showed an increase of 256 cases, Whooping Cough of 64 cases, and other infections 535 cases. Table XXXVIII.

During the year 1,284 examinations were made of sputum and blood of patients of the medical profession for the detection of Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Phthisis. This number shows a decrease of 281 on the return for 1914, and was 78 less than that for 1913. Diphtheria.—483 swabs were submitted, of which 123 gave positive results, and 360 negative. The results of these and other samples were immediately forwarded to the medical practitioners, some being sent by telephone or telegraphed direct to the doctors from the Lister Institute where the examinations were made. Enteric Fever.—35 examinations of blood taken from enteric fever patients were made, as contrasted with 59 in 1914, of which 16 proved positive, and 19 negative. Phthisis—766 specimens of sputum were examined, of which 198 gave positive results, and 568 negative. This return is 44 less than that for 1914, and 37 above that for 1913. It may be remarked that examinations for tubercle bacilli have of late years largely increased. This is due, of course, to the notification of Tuberculosis. The following Tables give the results of the examinations that have been made during the last 17½ years. Diseases. Total Examinations. Positive Results. Negative Results.

Disinfection of Rooms.—2,202 rooms were disinfected, as contrasted with 3,249 in 1914. For this purpose formaldehyde, either in a gaseous form or in solution, is usually employed, although it is sometimes augmented by sulphor dioxide, when it is necessary to kill vermin, for which purpose it has been found most effective.

There has been a considerable increase in the work of late years, more particularly since 1908; which demonstrates that full use is made of the plant. The disinfections included 65,251 articles removed from infected homes, as well as 46,144 articles, mostly second-hand garments, forwarded for disinfection by a large firm of dealers in such apparel. The description of the former are set out in the following statement. It may be mentioned, however, that the return does not include the garments of verminous school children, which were disinfected while they receive their baths. TABLE XLIV.

Cleansing of Verminous Children. — The new disinfecting apparatus has enabled the Engineer to disinfect these children's clothing at a steam pressure of 20 lbs., equal to a temperature of 260 degrees Fahrenheit, and to dry them while the children themselves are undergoing cleansing at the hands of the nurse whom the Council has appointed for the work. An arrangement between the London County Council and the Borough Council came into force in the early part of 1913, by which it was agreed that the latter body should receive 2s. for each set of baths given to a child during a calendar month. Under this arrangement, however, the expenditure of the Borough Council for the year ending Lady-day 1915, exceeded the amount received from the County Council by £9 8s. 7d., and accordingly representations were made to the County Council intimating that the Borough Council should not be called upon to suffer any monetary loss in connection with the work. Subsequently a new agreement was entered into with the London County Council for one year, for the cleansing of verminous children, and a guaranteed payment of 2s. per head for each complete cleansing of 1,000 children; the County Council also undertaking to pay the sum of 2s. for each child cleansed above the number guaranteed, such payment to cover the cost of any number of baths given within one calendar month from the date of the first bath. This agreement came into operation in October 1915. 74 . 1915] The total amount received during the year was £116 6s., being the sum payable for 1,163 sets of baths which were given to children. These baths were as under— 269 sets of 1 bath to each child. 191 do. do. 2 baths each do. 501 do. do. 3 do. do. 121 do. do. 4 do. do. 29 do. do. 5 do. do. 9 do. do. 6 do. do. 6 do. do. 7 do. do. 36 do. do. 8 do. do. 1 do. do. 9 do. do. *1,163 do. do. 3,176 baths * 57 of these sets were commenced in 1915, and completed in 1916. The average daily attendance of children at the baths throughout the year was 15, ranging from 1 to 30 per day. At the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, the homes of 721 children were visited and examined for verminous conditions. Of these requests 410 were forwarded through the Islington Cleansing Station, and 311 through Cleansing Stations outside the Borough. In 67 cases notices were served on the parents of children, and in 71 cases on the owners of the houses; in 8 cases bedding and clothing were removed for disinfection. Copies of these 721 reports were duly forwarded to the London County Council Education Department. In 8 cases the London County Council instituted legal proceedings under Section 122 of the Children Act, 1908, and the prosecutions resulted in fines varying from 6s. to 10s. as follows:— Amount of fine 6/- 10/- Number of cases 1 7 75 [1915 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ADMINISTRATION.

Of these notices 17 were served on the owners of factories, 31 on the owners of workshops, and 27 on the owners of restaurant kitchens. In addition to these nuisances, 182 were discovered on Outworkers' premises, necessitating the service of 34 notices. Registers.—There were 5,984 workshops on the Register, as contrasted with 5,246 in 1914, while the total number of workrooms was 7,031 as contrasted with 6,293 in the previous year. 1,351 workshops were added to the Register while 613 were removed from it.

There was an absence of dustbins, or a defect in them, in 53 instances. In 13 places the w.c. accommodation was insufficient; in 70 cases they were foul, and in 67 they were unsuitable or defective. In 12 instances separate accommodation for the sexes had to be provided. Altogether 429 sanitary defects had been remedied at the close of the year. One hundred and eighty-four nuisances were discovered in the homes of outworkers, from which 36 cases of infectious diseases had been notified. The following Table shows some of the work dealt with since 1896:— 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 Total Overcrowding 26 12 15 14 22 14 4 13 4 13 30 9 8 9 24 14 14 17 7 11 280 Ventilation 14 13 2 5 4 3 5 8 11 4 8 31 12 29 20 23 33 30 9 13 277 Dirty Premises 311 195 109 99 217 218 231 423 630 412 448 970 719 425 505 449 476 256 266 95 7,454 Drains 554 458 375 313 216 177 90 50 19 15 4 19 261 61 *.. *.. *.. *.. *.. *.. 2,612 W.C.'s 420 325 341 355 411 375 154 161 165 151 190 620 573 677 522 471 517 463 334 162 7,307 Water supplies 79 41 35 20 19 13 83 54 18 38 17 23 45 40 46 53 16 20 26 *.. 686 Surface drains 79 109 87 51 78 81 2 53 40 34 39 45 72 99 116 47 28 34 *.. *.. 1,094 * Now included in District Inspector's summary. Cleanliness.—The reports of the Inspectors show that 95 premises were found in an uncleanly state, and that 94 were remedied. In the eight preceding years the numbers have been as follows:—1907, 505; 1908, 425; 1909, 719; 1910, 970; 1911, 449; 1912, 476; 1913, 256; and 1914, 252. These figures conclusively prove that greater cleanliness is now to be found in the workshops and workplaces of the borough. Effluvium Nuisances. -None were detected. Ventilation.—Thirteen cases of insufficient ventilation were discovered, of which 11 had been remedied before the end of the year. Overcrowding.—In 11 instances overcrowding was disclosed, and 13 were remedied, which included some remaining over from 1914. Want of Drainage of Floors.—4 cases, invariably in laundries, were discovered where the floors were not so drained as to prevent the water standing on them. Notices were duly served, and all were complied with before the year had closed. 77 [1915 Sanitary Accommodation.—In only 12 workshops was separate accommodation for the sexes required, and it was provided before the end of the year. In 13 cases the number of w.c.'s was insufficient, but 12 had been provided before the close of the year. Uncleanliness of closet pans was found existing in 70 cases, and 66 of these were duly cleansed, while 67 that were unsuitable or defective were removed. Bakehouses.—Of the 236 registered bakehouses, only 173 are actually in use. The Chief Inspector, Mr. J. R. Leggatt, made his annual inspection of them, and reports thereon, as follows:- Public Health Department. Town Hall, Upper Street, N. 19th June, 1915. To the Medical Officer of Health. Dear Sir, I have completed my annual inspection of the hakehouses in use within the Borough, which number 173. As you are aware Inspector West has been absent from his duties for six months, and as the systematic inspection of the bakehouses is part of his work, I did not find them in such a satisfactory state as in former years. In a great many instances the reason given for the cleansing, etc. not having been carried out, was that owing to the War, labour is scarce. This is to an extent correct; as I found that in one case the occupier and his wife did the whole of the necessary work, and several of the bakehouses have been either painted or distempered by the occupiers themselves. I found that prior to my inspection a great many of the bakehouses occupied by Germans had been severely damaged as the result of rioting, and as a consequence were closed; but I am able to say that the majority of them have been re-opened. I have in previous reports referred to the necessity of regular inspection, and I was not at all surprised to find that owing to Mr. West's unfortunate illness, and of course his inability to carry out his duties that advantage had been taken of it by several occupiers by not exercising the same care and attention as they have previously done. Mr. West, who was so well known in the borough, took a great pride in this branch of his work, and he was most attentive to every detail, remembering as he did the importance of cleanliness being observed in the making and baking of bread, etc. I have communicated in every case the requirements of the department, and I am glad to state that the work is being, and will shortly be completed. It is being supervised by the District Inspectors, to whom I am indebted for their assisfance. I am, Yours faithfully JAMES R. LEGGATT Superintendent and Chief Sanitary Inspector. 78 1915] Outworkers' Premises.—There were 3,676 outworkers' premises on the Register, or 739 more than in the preceding year, when there was an increase of 302 as compared with 1914. The lists received from the employers in Islington contained the names and addresses of 3,432 outworkers, while there were also received from the Medical Officers of Health of other Boroughs, within and without the County, the names of 2,959 outworkers who resided here. It is once more to be noted that the lists are reluctantly forwarded by local employers, who, for the most part, do not send them until several applications have been made for them. During the year 280 letters were sent to employers reminding them of their failure to comply with the law. From these lists the names of 1,079 persons living outside Islington were abstracted and forwarded to Medical Officers of Health of the boroughs where they resided. How necessary is the work of inspecting the homes of outworkers may be clearly perceived from the fact that during the year it was found that in 8G instances these people were engaged in making wearing apparel in unwholesome houses; in making umbrellas and artificial flowers in 27, and paper boxes or bags in 20, while brush-making was carried out in 14. It was discovered also that 25 outworkers were making wearing'apparel in infected houses, artificial flowers in 3, and paper boxes, etc. in 4. Restaurants and kitchens where food is prepared.—There are now on the register 660 of these places, containing 889 separate rooms, and of these 260 inspections were made. A large amount of work is yet to be done in connection with them, for it was found that, out of 22 hotel and restaurant kitchens inspected, 4 were in an unsatisfactory state, while 40 out of 132 coffee and dining rooms were in a similar condition. The examination of 13 refreshment rooms showed that 2 were not satisfactory; while of 93 provision dealers, 28 were not as cleanly as they should have been. Improper storage of food was found in 5 instances, and 4 of these had been remedied at the close of the year. Dirty utensils were also discovered on 5 occasions, and these were all subsequently attended to. Workshops notified to H.M. Inspector.—Under the provisions of Section 133 of the Factory and Workshop Act, it is required that the Medical Officer of Health, when he becomes aware that any woman, young child, or person is employed in a workshop, shall forthwith send notice to H.M. Inspector of Factories. 60 workshops were reported during the year in accordance with this section. 79 [1915 Workshops notified to Home Office, 1915. Trade. Number of Workshops.

Outdoor Paupers.—On an average 3,437 persons were relieved in each week, as compared with 4,030 in 1914, with 4,619 in 1913, and with a decennial weekly average of 5,063. Of these paupers, the number of adults was 2,159, and of children under 16 years of age 1,278. Vagrants.—No vagrants were relieved, as the wards were closed in January, 1909.

This duty is performed by Inspector Wilkinson, Certificated Inspector of Meat. His work during the year has resulted in preventing the sale of a considerable quantity of unsound or diseased meat, which otherwise would have found itsway to the public. Unsound Food.—The total weights of the unsound food dealt with by the Inspector was 1 ton 10 cwts. 3 qrs. 25 lbs.; as contrasted with *12 tons 0 cwts. 2 qrs. 24 lbs. in 1914. * This total included 9 tons of damaged sweetmeats removed at owner's request. The following were the foodstuffs which were seized or surrendered and destroyed:— Tons. cwts. qrs. lbs.

The premises were found to be well kept. 4 premises were vacated during the year owing, it was stated, to the prevailing high prices of meat. The Inspector paid 1,303 visits to the premises, and found that the slaughtering was satisfactorily conducted, and that the slaughtered animals were of good quality and remarkably free from disease. The slaughtering of animals for food consumption in the borough is gradually decreasing as butchers now deal largely in the meat of animals which have been slaughtered in public abattoirs elsewhere. The War has, however, considerably checked the importation of foreign, chilled and frozen meat for home consumption. How far this will stimulate the market for home-bred cattle remains to be seen. In Islington there was an increase of 1,458 sheep and lamb killed in comparison with the year 1914. The number of animals slaughtered in the borough was 27,828, of which 947 were oxen, 8 were calves, 26,859 sheep and lambs, and 14 pigs. In the following return it will be noticed that pigs were slaughtered in the borough for the first time since 1908. It is given in order to show the gradual decrease in the number of animals slaughtered during the past 17 years:— Year Oxen. Cows. Calves. Sheep Lambs. Pigs.

Cowhouses—Only 4 cowhouses are in use in the borough, and these were visited upon 52 occasions. In two instances unhealthy conditions of the udder of cows were found and duly reported to the London County Council. As a result of the veterinary examination which followed it was shown that in one case the cow suffered from tuberculosis of the udder, and was therefore seized and slaughtered under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. Upon another occasion a diseased cow was discovered on the premises, but it was not giving milk. With these exceptions the cows were healthy. 97 [1915 List of Licensed Cowhouses in the Borough of Islington. Name of Licensee. Situation of Premises. No. of Cows licensed to hold.

To these a total of 12,475 visits were made, apportioned as under, viz.:— Butchers, Provision Dealers, etc., Shops 6,291 visits. Sausage Factories, etc. 251 ,, Butcher and Provision Stalls 253 ,, Fish Shops 1,618 ,, ,, Stalls 192 ,, Fruit Shops 2,712 ,, „ Stalls 1,158 ,, Total 12,475 visits. Offensive Trades.—The 3 tripe boilers, 2 gut scrapers and the knacker's yard received 99 visits during the year. In one case an official caution was sent to a tripe boiler because offensive smells were noticed in the road outside the premises, while in another instance defects in the floor of the tripe house were discovered and duly remedied. Milkshops and Dairies. At the close of the year there were 573 milk shops and dairies on the register, 9 having been added, and 21 removed, from it. They received 1,199 visits from the District Sanitary Inspectors, who served 43 notices for the execution of various sanitary improvements and the cleansing of dirty utensils. THE ADULTERATION OF FOODS AND DRUGS. During the year 1,207 samples of various foods and drugs were obtained by Inspector Burrell and submitted by him to the Public Analyst (Mr. Frank L. Teed, D.Sc.) for examination. Of these 1,080 were genuine, while 127, or 10.5 per cent., were adulterated. This is 0.7 per cent, higher than the percentage of adulteration in the preceding year, but 0.3 per cent, below the average rate during the last 24 years. 99 [1915 Table L.

The course adopted was to submit a number of samples to the Public Analyst without previous division, the samples so treated being dealt with as informal samples. Altogether 15 samples of cream were submitted, seven of which were purchased as preserved creams containing boric acid not exceeding 0.5 per cent., and 8 as creams free from preservatives. The Public Analyst reported four of the latter contained boric acid in amounts varying from 0.13 to 0.42 per cent. Three official samples were then purchased from the vendors who infringed the Act, and who made no declaration at the time of the sales, and the Public Analyst reported that all of the samples contained boric acid in quantities varying from 0.27 to 0.5.3 per cent. The general results obtained are set forth in the following tabular summary as prescribed by the Local Government Board:— 1. Cream not sold as Preserved Cream. Date. (A) Number of samples examined for the presence of a Preservative. (B) Number in which a Preservative was reported to be present. July 14 5 4* July 27 3 3† (B.) In every instance the preservative reported by the Public Analyst consisted of boric acid. * These were informal samples, against the vendors of which no action was taken. † These were official samples purchased as a result of the analysis of the informal samples. The vendors were afforded an opportunity of making a written explanation to the Public Health Committee, which was accepted in each case, and ultimately all were cautioned against a repetition of the offence. 2. Cream sold as Preserved Cream. (a) Instances in which samples have been submitted for analysis to ascertain if the statements on the labels as to preservatives were correct. (i) Correct statement made 5 (ii) Statements incorrect 2 Total 7 118 1915] Determination made of milk fat in cream sold as preserved cream. (i) Above 35 per cent. 7 (ii) Below 35 per cent. — Total 7 (c) Instances where (apart from analysis) the requirements as to labelling or declaration of preserved cream in Article V. (2) of the Regulations had not been observed. V (2) Cases 3 (d) Particulars of each case in which the Regulations have not been complied with, and action taken. Case 1.—The vendor served the cream from a jug, and, although the vessel handed to the purchaser had a label attached to the effect that the contents was preserved cream containing boric acid not exceeding 0.5 per cent., yet the vendor's storage jug was not so labelled. Case 2.—The offence was similar to No. 1, but the cream was sold as free from preservative. The action taken against the vendors was as stated above. 3. Thickening Substances. Any evidence as to their addition to cream or preserved cream Nil. Action taken, when found — 4. Other observations, if any. INFORMAL SAMPLING OF FOOD. During the year Mr. Burrell, the Food and Drugs Inspector, obtained 722 samples of food informally, which were subsequently tested by him. <S2 of these samples were found to be adulterated, or 11 per cent. of the total purchased. In 53 instances the informal investigations were followed up by the purchase of official samples, which were submitted to the Public Analyst for complete analyses, and who reported 51 for prosecution ; also that 1 milk sample was adulterated with less than five per cent. of added water, while a sample of gin was declared to be genuine. 119 [1915 The vendor of the milk sample referred to above, together with a very deaf shopkeeper who had sold wood vinegar as malt vinegar, and stated he had not heard the word "malt" when the purchase was made, were cautioned. In the remaining 50 cases, summonses were issued, resulting in the defendants being fined with costs, a total amount of £131 16s. The several foods tested were as follows:— Number of Samples. Genuine. Adulterated. Percentage Adulteration.

Notes.—This Table is arranged to show the gross births and deaths in the district, and the births and deaths properly belonging to it with the corresponding rates The rates are calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population † In Column 6 are included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, eg., casuals, are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. In Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of "non-residents" are deducted, and in Column 9 the number of deaths of "residents" registered outside the district are added in calculating the nett death-rate of the district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, work" houses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such Institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) it this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known; and (i) failing this, to the district where the body was found.
