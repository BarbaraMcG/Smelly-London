(i) Bed Bugs. During the year 44 complaints were received of infestation of premises by bed bugs. The number of houses and/or their contents found to be infested was 47 (including 8 in the Council's possession). In suitable cases, and on the request of tenant and owner, the disinfestation of the premises and contents were simultaneously carried out by the Department. In all other cases the premises were disinfested by the owners, and the contents by the tenants. In all necessary cases bedding was steam disinfected by the Department. The usual method of disinfestation insisted upon is to strip as much woodwork from walls, etc., as possible, seal the premises and use a sulphurous gas or spray with contact fluid. Close supervision was made of premises which had been disinfested, and tenants were given suitable advice and instruction on methods of prevention and destruction of vermin. (ii) Rats and Mice. 710 visits were made to premises in connection with rat infestation. 89 complaints were received, and at 119 premises infestation was remedied, 22 In order to assist those affected with rat, etc., infestation, especially in view of the prevailing conditions, a whole-time rat-catcher has been engaged since the commencement of October, 1941. His services have been found very useful and have met a definite need. In addition to dealing with rodents on private property, he also undertook similar duties on the properties in the possession of the Council. During the three months of his service he attended at 19 private properties, paying 18 visits for this purpose. 8. Food Inspections. (i) Meat Inspection.

The large majority of the cesspools drain premises not within a reasonable distance of a sewer, and the few that drain premises within this distance were constructed prior to the laying of the sewer.
