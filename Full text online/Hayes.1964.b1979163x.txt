Page 2 MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT Tel: HAYes 1901 Public Health Department, Springfield House, Hayes End Road, Hayes, Middlesex, March, 1965. To the Chairman and Members of the Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my last annual report on the health of the Urban District of Hayes and Farlington. The incidence of infectious diseases was low in 1964. There have been outbreaks of "winter vomiting" in 3 schools in the district during the spring and summer. These followed the well known pattern of brief illness of dramatic onset with rapid recovery affecting mainly "infants"; no causative agent was isolated and the occurrence of school holidays put an end to the spread of infection. There was also an outbreak of Sonnei dysentery in a residential nursery. This infection was introduced by 2 children who already had the disease on admission. It was not severe and was eradicated without difficulty but not until most of the children and some of the staff had contracted it. In anticipation of the biennial measles epidemic of winter 1964/65 the Medical Research Council carried out trials of a measles vaccine in September and October and a number of parents in the district took advantage of the protection offered to their children. Those selected were in the age group 10 months to 2 years and a follow up during the early part of 1965 when the measles incidence will be at its height should show how satisfactory the vaccine is. Turning to the other end of the age scale, there have been improved facilities available for old people in the district. The local welfare committee is a very active voluntary organisation which has provided meals on wheels and holidays for the disabled for some years. The scope of the meals has been doubled, and in addition there has been a scheme for subsidised meals to be obtained at the Civic Restaurant. In co operation with the County Council as local health authority chiropody has been provided for both the ambulant and the house bound and a 3 long felt need has now been filled by the institution by the County Council of an incontinence pads service. Only those who have had to cope with all the washing and unpleasantness involved in nursing the incontinent, can appreciate fully the benefit of disposal pads, and the provision of the service has meant that a number of people who would otherwise have to enter hospital have been able to stay at home. Work on Home Safety has continued quietly chiefly by talks and films, some given to clubs and a few to school children. Although local statistics about the number of home accidents treated in hospital have been available for some time, it was felt that this is not sufficient and that if home accidents were notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health more could be done in prevention by judicious visiting and advice. Pending action on a national scale the Health and Safety Committee decided to try and achieve local notification voluntarily, and approached the Uxbridge Group Hospital Management Committee with a request that the matter should be considered. At the time of writing no reply had been received but the request was under consideration. The vital statistics are very similar to those of previous years. There has been another small rise in the birth rate and I am pleased to be able to report a fall in the still birth rate to the lowest for 20 years but the infectious diseases'and Perinatal death rates have risen which is less encouraging. Finally I should like to thank the members of the Council especially those of the Public Health Committee for their support during the year. This is my opportunity to record my appreciation of the work of the Public Health Department staff who have been so willing and loyal over the years; unfortunately the better their work is done the less conspicuous it becomes and smooth running is almost the only sign of efficiency. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, V. SHAW Medical Officer of Health * Tables showing the incidence of infectious diseases will be found on page 46. 4 STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5,159 Population (census 1961) 67,912 Population (mid-year 1S64) Registrar General's estimate of civilian population 68,870 Number of inhabited houses as at 3lst December, 1964 20, 935 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December, 1964 £4,599,119 Product of penny rate £18,925 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR Live births: M F Total Legitimate 679 623 1,302 Illegitimate 32 31 63 1,365 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 19.8 Comparability factor is 0.93 giving a corrected birth rate of 18.4 Birth rate for England and Wales 18. 4 Illegitimate live births expressed as a percentage of total live births 4.6 Still births: M F Total Legitimate 6 9 15 Illegitimate 1 - 1 16 Bate per 1,000 live and still births 11.6 Total live and still births: M F Total 718 663 1,381 5 Infant mortality (deaths under 1 year) M F Total Legitimate 19 6 25 Illegitimate - - - Total infant deaths per 1,000 live births 18.3 Legitimate infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 19.2 Illegitimate infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births - Neo-natal deaths & mortality rate: M F Total Neo-natal deaths (under 4 weeks) Legitimate 13 5 18 Illegitimate - - - Neo-natal mortality rate (deaths under 4 weeks) per 1,000 total live births 13.2 Early neo-natal deaths (under 1 week) Legitimate 13 3 16 Illegitimate - - - Early neo-natal mortality rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births 11.7 Per inatal mortality rate (still births and deaths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) 23.2 Maternal mortality (including abortion): Number of deaths - Rate per 1,000 total live and still births - Deaths: M F Total 321 224 545 Death rate per 1,000 of the estimated population 8 Comparability factor is 1.48 giving a corrected death rate of 11.8 Death rate for England and Wales 11.3 6 7 BIRTH AND DEATH RATES, ETC.

Water is supplied to the district by the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Company and the South West Suburban District Water Company. It is adequate in quantity and quality and samples tested during the year have been satisfactory. The water is hard and has no plumbo-solvent action and its fluoride content is less than 1 part per million. Recommendations that this should be raised to the level of 1 part per million have been made but no action has been taken as yet. All dwellings in the district receive a direct mains water supply but there are approximately 130 caravans and for these water is supplied from stand-pipes. Samples taken from these pipes have been satisfactory. Medical Examination of Council Employees. These figures are lower than in previous years owing to a change of policy arising out of the pending amalgamation with neighbouring districts. A medical history questionnaire is completed by all candidates and if this is satisfactory no physical examination is carried out. This provides a saving of time for both medical and other personnel. Altogether 152 questionnaires were received. 69 examinations were carried out - 20 for superannuation, 13 for sick pay and 10 for superannuation/sick pay and 26 for other reasons. Vaccination and Immunisation. The tables relating to vaccination and immunisation are included by courtesy of the Area Medical Officer.

Owing to pressure of work in connection with London Government re-organisation and the desirability of completing this report before the 3lst March it will, apart from this foreword be almost entirely statistical. By the time this report is read the Urban District of Hayes and Harlington will have passed out of existence and the area will be part of the London Borough of Hillingdon. It seems appropriate therefore that an attempt should be made to draw a pen-picture of the state of environmental hygiene in Hayes and Harlington on the eve of its integration into the new Borough. Dealing first with the basic necessities of life it can be said that every dwelling has a piped supply of water every house has a water closet, (97½% of them are inside the house) eleven houses are not connected to the sewer (of these, two have private sewage disposal plants, another three are due for early demolition and the rest have well-constructed cesspools): only 2% of houses lack bathrooms and a supply of hot water on tap, the provision of the standard amenities to every house in the district has been approved in principle by the Council and one Improvement Area declared. Only one house in every 1,235 is statutorily overcrowded and the average rate of occupation is 3.30 persons to every self-contained dwelling. Despite a large reservoir of immigrant population in neighbouring districts multiple occupation has been kept under control and does not represent a serious problem, but the need for continuing vigilance cannot be over-emphasised. So far as unfit houses are concerned., on the highest practicable standard, 33 houses are deemed to require demolition. Ten years ago the Council constructed, on an orchard site at Harlington, a caravan site for nearly 100 moveable dwellings. The site was laid out to a very high standard and continues to serve a most useful purpose. 13 Food hygiene lends itself to written assessment less than almost any other aspect of a Public Health Inspector's workbut the following jottings can be regarded as a guide to the prevailing standards. Although there is a great deal of large-scale catering in the district e.g. large factory canteens, aircraft catering establishment and civic restaurant as well as the usual run of restaurants, school canteens etc. no major outbreak of food poisoning has occurred for many years every hawker of open food and every mobile ice-cream dealer carries proper washing facilities; food premises are inspected on average 6 or 7 times a year; a lot of attention is paid to health education of food handlers by means of lectures, film shows etc. to supplement the educational work carried out as a normal part of the Inspectors' routine visits samples of those foods most commonly associated with food poisoning (cooked meats, cream cakes etc.) are taken regularly for bacteriological examination and particular attention has been given to the special problems associated with aircraft catering which is carried out on a large scale in the district. Only 4 houses need regular routine visits by the Public Health Inspectors for the purpose of ensuring that a reasonable standard of domestic cleanliness is maintained: the incidence of bugs and fleas amounts to 7 or 8 cases a year and the level of rodent infestation can be judged from the fact that treatment in dwellings, shops, commercial premises and some factories (the larger ones are treated by private operators) occupies the services of only one operator for about 15 hours a week. Nuisances (in the public health sense) are not numerous. Open sites, hedges and ditches are used for the dumping of household refuse in spite of the availability of a free removal service and builders rubble too is often deposited on these sites the adoption, some years ago, of Byelaws for piggeries and stables led to a considerable reduction in the number of these establishments and to a big improvement in the remainder every year the canal feeder which runs across the northern part of the district gives rise to complaints but trouble here is more visual than physical; in spite of the district's industrial background complaints about noise, apart from aircraft noise, are very few. There are, of course, no legal powers available to Local Authorities to deal with this nuisance and the ever increasing power and size of aircraft lead one to believe, however regretfully, that noise from this source is unlikely to grow less. 14 The ten-year programme to cover the whole district with Smoke Control Areas is nearing completion Smoke Control Orders have been made for 90% of the area and 80% of the dwellings in the district. Any visible smoke from industrial premises is so unusual as to call for comment and investigation, According to figures published by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research the degree of pollution in the district is now as good as or better than many small non-industrial towns with a reputation for salubriousness. This is a picture of a busy industrial town, clean, pleasant and well-run which can, thanks to a progressive Council and a keen hardworking staff enter the new consortium with its head held high. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following headings:- I. Sanitary Administration, viz:- inspection of the district, summary of complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage and sewerage, keeping of animals, rodent control, destruction of vermin and insect pests, disinfection, ponds, ditches and watercourses. II. Air Pollution, viz:- smoke control areas, height of chimneys, new furnaces, the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958, grit and dust, byelaws re. new heating and cooking appliances, pollution from road vehicles, pollution from railway, industrial bonfires, measurement of atmospheric pollution, publicity West Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee.

Offensive Trades There are two establishments in the district at which the trade of rag sorting is carried on. In both cases the premises are satisfactory and proper supervision over the disposal of the rags is exercised. Drainage and Sewerage The table below includes all premises in the district which are not on main drainage. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging was continued. Cesspool Drainage Pail closets A. Premises within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 2 - B. Premises within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension - - C. Premises where no sewer is likely to become available 13 4 D. Premises likely to be demolished soon 3 - Totals 18 4 19 Four small private sewage disposal plants are in use. A 50% grant is available for the conversion of pail closets to water closets and for the abolition of cesspools. Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. Keeping of Animals Bye laws under section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure, etc. Rodent Control Infestation in the district is at a very low level and one assistant, with many duties in addition to rodent control is well able to cope with all the treatment necessary. At dwellings this is free but a charge is made for work carried out at business premises. The statistical report on rodent control is set out in Appendix II. Destruction of Vermin and Insect Pests During the year the following treatments were carried out:- wasps 4 Cockroaches 2 Bugs 5 Ants 15 Pleas 2 Disinfection In accordance with current practice terminal disinfection of premises or personal property is no longer carried out except in the case of the more serious infectious diseases. All library books, however, which have been in infected premises are disinfected before they are returned to the library. 20 Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses, etc The routine inspection of these sites for rodent infesta tion, pollution, general nuisances and mosquitoes was carried out and remedial action taken where necessary. 21 PART II - AIR POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas. The ten-year programme to bring the whole of the Urban District under Smoke Control continued according to schedule and by the end of the year the following progress had been made:- No. of Smoke Control Orders Acres No. of Dwellings Involved Other Buildings Involved Local Authority Private In operation 22 4,141 2,412 11,088 760 Confirmed but not yet in operation 1 180 496 785 119 Orders made but not yet confirmed 2 302 168 1,725 23 Totals 25 4,623 3,076 13, 598 902 These areas account for 90% of the area of the district and 80% of the dwellings in the district. No exemptions to Smoke Control Orders have been granted except in the case of premises likely to be demolished in the near future. Exemptions permitting the use of sticks and paper for kindling have not been necessary as gas is readily available throughout the district and where a householder has a rooted objection to the use of gas, electricity is invariably available as an alternative. (b) Height of Chimneys. Plans submitted for byelaw approval are passed to me by the Engineer and Surveyor for a decision on this particular point. During the year 3 plans were examined for this purpose; in two instances the height had been previously agreed and in the other it was necessary to ask for a taller chimney than was shown on the plan. 22 (c) New Furnaces. Nine notifications under Section 3(3) of the Clean Air Act were received regarding the installation of new furnaces; eight were oil-fired, and one gas-fired. Two applications for prior approval under Section 3(2) of the Act were received and agreed. (d) The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. These regulations lay down the maximum period for which dark and black smoke may be emitted from industrial furnaces. Industrial boiler plant in the District is now operated at a very high degree of efficiency and most installations are for all practical purposes, entirely smokeless in operation. Ko contraventions were observed during the year. (e) Grit and Dust. A complaint of nuisance from soot smuts emitted from a factory chimney was received, following representations from the department the nuisance was abated. ({) building Byelaws re. Heating and Cooking Appliances, A building byelaw, made under Section 24 of the Clean Air Act, has been in force in this district from 1st September, 1957. It requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating and cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity or oil or solid smokeless fuels. (g) Pollution from Road Vehicles. Although the Council has no statutory powers to deal with the emission of smoke or fumes from road vehicles any cases which are observed are drawn to the attention of the owners of the vehicles and in most cases a co-operative attitude is met with, two letters were written to the owners of offending vehicles. (h) Pollution from Railway. The main line of the Western Region of British Railways which runs through the industrial part of the district is now largely dieselised. 23 (i) Industrial Bonfires. Section 47 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1961, which closes one of the gaps in the Clean Air Act by prohibiting dark smoke from industrial bonfires, is in operation, and is proving a most valuable additional aid in the clean air campaign. (j) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution. Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. 24 Monthly Averages for Sulphur Dioxide, 1964.

More than 10,000 leaflets were distributed in proposed and actual Smoke Control Areas. These leaflets are supplied free of charge by the Ministry, the Coal Utilisation Council, Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, the North Thames Gas Board and the Southern Electricity Board. (1) Vest Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee. Three meetings were held during the year and a wide range of topics discussed including fixing costs and revised arrangements for grants; displays of electric storage heaters and gas fires were arranged by the respective Boards and members paid a visit to Charringtons new mechanised fuel handling Depot, Neasden. Towards the end of the year arrangements were being made to amalgamate with the Hammersmith Inter-Borough Smoke Control Committee. The following authorities with a population of approximately 650,000 and an area of 40,050 acres are represented on the Committee:- Acton Borough Council Brentford & Chiswick Borough Council Ealing Borough Council Feltham Urban District Council Hayes & Harlington Urban District Council Heston & Isleworth Borough Council Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council Southall Borough Council 26 PART III - FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is naintained and the numbers shown on the Register are:- Milk Distributors 27 Dairies 2 It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1959, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream. Twenty premises are registered for the manufacture of ice cream but only 7 of these are now actually used for this purpose. A further 109 premises are registered for the sale of ice cream, in the majority of cases only wrapped ice cream is sold. The requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are complied with by all manufacturers in the district. Sixty-four samples of ice cream were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, for bacteriological exam ination. The grading of samples taken was as follows:- Grade I 30 or 46.80% Grade II 21 or 32.89% Grade III 5 or 7.81% Grade IV 8 or 12. 5% Of the eight samples in the lowest grade six were from one itinerant vendor from outside the district. Hie Inspection of Meat and Other Foods By Orders (S.I. Nos. 2154 and 2155-1960) made by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood under the Slaughterhouse Reports (Appointed Day) Order, 1959, the Construction Regulations contained in the Slaughterhouse (Hygiene) Regulations, 1958, and the Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations, 1958, are in force. 27 There are no licensed slaughterhouses in the district. A large proportion of the meat sold in the district comes from the London wholesale markets and there does not appear to be any demand from the trade for slaughtering facilities in this district. One slaughterman's licence was issued. The following foods were condemned during the year:- Cooked Meats 63½ lbs. Meat (raw) 1,648½ lbs. Meat (tinned) 1,713¾ lbs. Pish (raw) 462 lbs. Fish (tinned) 33 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 933½ lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 509½ lbs. Miscellaneous Food (tinned) 176¼ lbs. Other Miscellaneous Food 103½ lbs. Miscellaneous Frozen Pood 938½ lbs. Miscellaneous Frozen Meat 40 lbs. Eggs 150 Condemned foods are disposed of, whenever possible, to a manufacturer of animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers. Small quantities of condemned foods are buried, under supervision, on the Council's refuse tip. Food Hygiene. Emphasis has again been placed on the education of food handlers, as the general standard in this aspect of food hygiene still falls short of the structural standard of food premises. Twenty-four lectures were given to a total of 396 people. No certificates of exemption from certain requirements of the Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, have been granted. Byelaws under Section 15 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950. 28 Hawkers of Food The registration of hawkers of all classes of foodstuffs is compulsory under the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Pood hygiene Regulations. Mobile shops from which groceries, meat, fish, ice cream, refreshments or any other open food are sold, are all fitted with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels, and nailbrushes. Number of Hawkers registered 72 Number of hawkers' storage premises registered 11 The difference between these figures is accounted for by (a) the fact that it is common for these traders to buy their produce from day to day, and (b) many hawkers having storage premises in other districts. Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) The routine sampling of miscellaneous foods was continued during the year. The following samples were examined:- Frozen Complete teal 1 Cream Cakes etc 12 Imitation Cream 14 Pish Cakes 2 Cooked Tinned Meats 113 Trifle 1 Frozen Whole Egg 1 114 Although there are no bacteriological standards for these foods, the reports received, apart from giving an assurance of the absence of pathogenic organisms, are a useful guide as to the standard of handling practised in the food trade. The bacteriological examination of samples of ice cream, water and some of the miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory for their ready assistance 29 at all times; also to the Director and Staff of the Central Public health Laboratory, N.W. 9 for their valued assistance in connection with samples of miscellaneous foods. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. (b) The Chief Officer of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council states that owing to staff shortage it is not possible to supply the usual information about samples of food and drugs taken in the District for chemical analysis. Food Poisoning. No outbreaks of food poisoning occurred during the year. Complaints about Food. Forty two complaints were received about food alleged to be contaminated, unsound or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded. Some were of a trivial nature but it was decided to take proceedings in five cases.

During the year 4 new cases were discovered but 5 cases were abated leaving 17 outstanding at the end of the year. The average number of occupants to each self contained dwelling was 3.30. Houses in Multiple Occupation Ten new cases were reported for action and in four of these notices were served under Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961, requiring the provision of additional amenities in accord ance with the Standards adopted by the Council. As commonwealth immigrants are often involved in multiple occupation it is a considerable advantage that a member of the clerical staff of the Department can speak both of the principal languages of the Indian sub-continent. Certificates of Disrepair The following action was taken under the Rent Act, 1957, in connection with Certificates of Disrepair:- Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (Form I) 4 Landlords notified of proposals to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 2 Undertakings given by Landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 2 Applications by Landlord or Tenant for Certificate as to the remedying of Defects which Landlord has undertaken to remedy (Form 0) 3 Certificates issued as to the Remedying of Defects specified in a Landlord's undertaking to remedy Defects (Form P) 2 Application for Cancellation of Certificate of Disrepair (Form M) 3 Certificate of Disrepair (Form R.C. 2) 2 Improvement of Dwelling Houses 38 applications were received for Standard Grants. 34 3 applications were received for Discretionary Grants. An area which includes 108 of the older type properties which are lacking in one or more of the standard amenities was declared an improvement area for the purpose of Part II of the Housing Act, 1964. Moveable Dwellings. To avoid involving both the Health and Safety Committee and the Town Planning Committee in this Matter and as planning consent is an essential preliminary to a site licence the enforcement of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, has been entrusted to the Town Planning Committee. Consultation between the Engineer and Surveyor's Department and the Public Health Department takes place on applications for Site Licences. New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and Private Developers:- Council: Bouses Nil Old Persons' Dwellings 14 Flats 62 Maisonettes 12 Private Development: Dwellings 1ll Housing Association: Dwellings Nil 35 PART V - FACTORIES, SHOPS, OFFICES, ETC. There are one hundred and eighty four factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including:- Aircraft, bread and confectionery, building materials, car accessories, carbon products, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, electrical condensers and transformers, electronic devices, fibre glass articles, furniture, light and heavy engineering goods, lubricating oil, meat products, optical lenses, plastics, precision tools, printed paper articles, radar, gramophone records, rubber products, tarmacadam, toys and woven wire articles and steel wool. Full details of the inspections carried out and notices served are set out in Appendix 1 to this report. Outworkers. Part VII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons carrying out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. There are 111 outworkers in the district and 220 inspections were made, in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops. Prior to the introduction of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, all parts of the Shops Act were administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants etc. The Act applies to 632 premises in the district to which the Public Health Inspectors made 842 visits. It was not necessary to serve any notices for infringements. Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, This Act came into operation during the year and 694 premises were registered by the Council. 8 accidents were reported and investigated. The occupier of one premises applied for exemption from provisions as regards temperature, sanitary and washing facilities but the application was refused. 36 PART VI - MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. During the year 110 licences were issued in respect of:206,920 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures 27,142 gallons of cellulose solutions Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act Although upholstering is carried out at several premises in the district the Act does not apply to any of them as the type of filling generally used is outside the scope of the Act. All premises used for upholstery and similar trades are visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and the type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas, electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards. Such appliances are sold at 39 shops in the district and all were visited by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Pour premises are licensed under the Act, and seven visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to secure compliance with the conditions of the Licence. Agriculture (Safety, Health & Welfare Provisions) Act 1956. Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and in this district, which is still partly rural, the Act serves a useful purpose. 37 Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the Local Authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises, of which there are six. are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected. Swimming Pools, There is no public swimming pool in the district. There are practice pools at three local junior schools, all have automatic dosing equipment and continuous filtration. There is a swimming pool at one of the new hotels in the district. Continuous filtration and automatic chlorination is carried out. Samples of water were taken regularly from ail these pools, 9 samples were unsatisfactory, but on subsequent samples these, and all others, were of excellent bacteriological quality, show ing that the arrangements for the purification of the water were adequate. Land Charges Act, 1925 During the year 1,818 applications for information from persons proposing to acquire premises in the district were dealt with. Each one required answers to questions about sanitary notices or orders (outstanding or contemplated), Smoke Control Orders, Certificates of Disrepair and Slum Clearance. Licensing Act, 1961. Seven applications for the issue or renewal of a licence were investigated and all were found to be satisfactory. Noise Abatement. London Airport is by far the greatest source of noise in the district; aircraft however are exempt from the provisions of the Noise Abatement Act. Twelve complaints of noise nuisance were received and these were dealt with by informal methods. 38 Appendix I Part A.
