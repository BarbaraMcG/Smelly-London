H. , Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1962 BY B. BROADBENT, M. A. ,M. B. ,M.R. C. S. ,D. P. H. , Medical Officer of Health. Printed by WATERLCW & SONS LIMITED. S.S.8090 2. To the MAYOR, ALDERMEN and COUNCILLORS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I apologise for the fact that my Annual Report is rather later than usual, but this is due solely to the fact that it was unable to be completed earlier owing to the late arrival of certain figures which we, in this Department, regard as essential for making it complete. I am pleased to be able to say in this report, (which is my final one before reaching retiring age) that the usual vital statistics for the Borough are better than average, in that the birth rate is up, death rate down, infant mortality rate below 21, neo-natal mortality down to 13.4, with (again) no maternal deaths, the one disconcerting figure being the rise in stillbirths from 16 to 29. Infectious diseases were remarkable for their absence, and the only deaths attributable to infection were 9 from tuberculosis. This could be improved if people would only respond to the free chest X Rays which are always available, and for which there will be a special week at the Geffrye Museum at the end of September. Although the death rate has improved in spite of the relatively large number of old people in this Borough, I regret to have to say that the death from cancer of the lung have risen from 20 to 35, and the deaths from coronary thrombosis have increased from 63 to 89, some of these deaths now occurring before the age of 45, and a larger number than formerly being among women. As both these diseases are largely preventable by avoiding cigarette smoking, and cancer of the lung capable of earlier diagnosis by X Ray examination (thus making it more hopeful of successful treatment) their increase would seem to indicate a failure of our poster campaign. But we must bear in mind that it requires 20-25 years of abuse to produce a lung cancer, and there are other causes of coronary thrombosis, though it has been proved that if cigarette smoking is stopped even late in life, the chances of developing these conditions are considerably reduced. Suicides have trebled this year, although a total of 6 for this Borough is not excessive in these days of turmoil, especially now that suicide is no longer regarded as the criminal act that it has always been. The more detailed report of the 1961 Census findings, published earlier this year, shows several interesting points in Shoreditch which might be briefly summarised here. For example, the population of the Borough had dropped from 97,000 in 1931 to 45,000 in 1951, and. further to 40,500 in 1961 (it is now estimated even below 40,000 but the daytime population seems greater than ever, especially on the roads.) In terms of Wards, Moorfields has shrunk almost to 1,000, while Haggerston has actually increased, the others spreading their decrease evenly. Despite the reduction in population the figure for old age pensioners is still 5,665, of whom 9 were over 95 years old and 47 over 90. I was somewhat surprised to find that, of these, 1,645 live entirely 3. alone, and. more than 3,000 have only pensioners in the dwelling, thus showing how necessary it is to have our 3 visitors for old people. Of the whole population, 13.6% (over 5,500) have still more than l½ persons living and sleeping in a single room (in Moorfields Ward nearly 22%) though only 1,200 were born outside the British Isles, and all this despite the fact that almost 2/3 of all dwellings are municipally owned and not over-crowded. There were no caravans or other mobile dwellings (though one caravan has this year attempted to "rest" here). More than 36% of all households still had neither piped hot water nor a fixed bath, and yet despite this, scabies and lice are almost unknown now. But to return to the contents of this report, it is encouraging to report that thanks to the "Friends of the Chest Clinic" headed by Councillor J.D.Welch and other regular supporters, the T©B. Care Committee has never had such good financial backing, despite the reduced sale of "seals". The improvement in the nature and quality of meals served to old age pensioners has been so great since the service was transferred to the Town Hall Canteen during the year, that 120 old people each day are receiving these 10d. twocourse hot meals, either in their own homes or in the Council's clubs, and this is contributing a great deal to their continued good health - and the service is still continuing to increase. The changed use of the Council's coach, for taking about a dozen homebound old people to the clubs each weekday has paid dividends also, in that these people have improved beyond all recognition - e.g. the crippled can now walk upstairs normally, and the absent-minded are quite clear-headed. With the opening of the new seaside Holiday Hotel at St.Leonard's in 1963, there should be a further improvement in health all round, for those who so rarely can afford to leave London (the country home at Copthorne had unfortunately to be closed for lack of staff). The 3 old people's visitors paid more than 4,400 visits during the year and so contributed a great deal to their comfort and health. Great progress was made in several directions during 1962, in purely sanitaxy matters, and this cannot be summarised satisfactorily in fewer words than is presented in the preamble to "Sanitary Circumstances" (page 24 ). Shoreditch has become well-known as the Borough where the noise of road drills has been reduced on Borough contracts, by the insertion of a conditional clause in these agreements. The reduction of fumes from diesel engines passing through the Borough is also well-known, as is the introduction of pocket tape recorders for reducing time spent by Public Health Inspectors in clerical work. Two new smoke control areas became operative (Pitfield in June, Wenlock in September), and it is hoped that fuel difficulties will be much reduced before the winter of 1963 by ensuring the purchase, at reasonable prices, of smokeless fuel by slot machine. (P.S. Hope of this is now, alas,fading). The rat population has been much further reduced this year by finding and sealing off disused drains so that breeding places are minimised, and in this work the "Revealer" has helped enormously, by tracing the run of these drains very effectively (page 52). So much have these items helped, that not a single complete "take" of 108l was recorded. 4. The advent of parking meters in the Borough has produced quite a series of difficult decisions from a medical viewpoint, as to whether exemption should be granted, and has probably saved many afflicted persons from deteriorating. The authentication of International vaccination certificates has been sufficiently prolific to show that many more Shoreditch people than one would imagine are otherwise being exposed to smallpox and similar risks, so that it is imperative that we keep our defences in working order. The medical referee work is worthy of its former placing in Harley Street, but can be more closely followed by a local worker and probably a fairer decision can be reached for all concerned. Similarly superannuation examinations of both manual and office staff give one the satisfaction of being able to guide incoming staff on methods of avoiding later, otherwise unnecessary breakdowns. Finally, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to thank all those members of the Council, other Departments, and especially the staff of the Health and Welfare Departments, who have unstintingly given of their best in improving the health and welfare of the Borough's inhabitants. Yours faithfully, B. BROAD BENT. Medical Officer of Health. Shoreditch Town Hall, Old Street, E.C.I. SHOreditch 7600. 5.

The Registrar-General's estimate for the mid-year 1962 population was 39,580, a decrease of 950 on the previous year. This figure is used for statistical purposes throughout this report. The density of the population is 60 persons per acre. The Area Comparability Factors for the Borough are Births 0.95 and Deaths 0.84, and the rates shown in this report have been adjusted accordingly. BIRTHS. The number of registered live births allocated to the Borough during the calendar year 1962 were as follows Total live births - (legitimate and illegitimate) Males 356 Females 315 Total 671 Illegitimate live births Males 36 Females 30 Total 66 The birth rate for the Borough was 16.10. For England and Wales the rate was 18.0 and for London 19.6. The illegitimate births represented 9.83 per cent of all births in the borough. STILLBIRTHS. The number of registered stillbirths allocated to the borough was 20, or 2.89 per cent of all births. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages during the year was 315 and the marriage rate was 15.9 per 1,000 population. The marriage rate for the Metropolis was 21.3 and that for England and Wales 14.9. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the borough in 1962 was - 571 Transferable deaths - Non-residents registered in Shoreditch - 242 Shoreditch residents registered elsewhere - 202 The number of deaths allocated to the borough is therefore- 531 This gives a death rate for the Borough of 11.26 compared with 11.9 for England and Wales, and 12.0 for London. In connection with these deaths 20 inquests were held. 414 or 79 per cent of the people belonging to Shoreditch who died during the year, died in hospital. The table on page 9 showing causes of death at all ages has been supplied by the Registrar-General. 11. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of infants under one year numbered 14 of which 9 were males. These deaths amounted to 2.64 per cent of the total net Shoreditch deaths from all causes, as compared with 3.45 per cent in 1961. The infantile mortality rate (death rate of infants under one year per 1,000 live births) for Shoreditch was 20.86, the rate for England and Wales being 21.6 and that for London 21.1 Four illegitimate infants died. The number of deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age was 9* which gives a neo-natal rate of 13.41. INFANTILE MORTALITY IN THE BOROUGH DURING 1962.

COMPULSORY REMOVAL OF AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to the Court for an Order for the removal to hospital or other institution of a person who is aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, and who is living in insanitary conditions and "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention". In addition, during 1951, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act came into force. Under this Act, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and other practitioner, emergency removals of such people for periods not exceeding three weeks may be enforced by the Courts. Powers under these Acts were used on two occasions during the year. A man aged 67, living alone in filthy conditions was unable to care for himself and refused to be helped by anyone. After difficulty a doctor managed to see him and found he was suffering from a grave chronic disease. An Order was obtained under the Amendment Act for his immediate removal to St. Matthews Hospital. There his health improved and after a few months he was transferred to an L.C.C. Old People's Home. The other patient, a woman aged 67, who was suffering from a chronic disease was incapable of caring for herself and yet refused assistance from other persons. For her sake it was necessary to arrange for compulsory removal and she was admitted to an L.C.C. Old People's Home. These two represent the failures, but the vast majority of people were amenable to persuasion and derived benefit. BURIAL OF THE DEAD. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is responsible for arranging for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made. During the year onlyone case occurred where the Council had to arrange for burial. The Council have not yet carried out any cremations, as although it may appear at the time of death that there are no surviving relatives, there is always the remote possibility that at some future date, one may come forward and start enquiries which might result in the Council's action being disputed . III - INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES During the year only 233 notifications of infectious disease were received and over 50% of these were in respect of measles. SMALLPOX AND VACCINATION. No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year and no vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpx Prevention) Regulations, 1917, though many awkward questions were answered, and many suspected cases were proved not to be instances of that disease. 13.

PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS 1925- These regulations prohibit a person suffering from tuberculosis, and who is in an infectious condition, from following any employment or occupation in connection with a dairy which would involve the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of vessels used for containing milk. No formal action was necessary during the year. 18. mass miniature radiography I am indebted to Dr. Thompson, Medical Director of Unit 6D for the following report :- "Introduction During 1962 the Unit examined 40,706 males and 27,056 females making a total of 67,762. Up to the end of 1962 the Unit has examined 453,067 males and 306,732 females - making a grand total of 759,799 since it commenced operations in May 1950. Fifty-six (56) cases (49 males and 7 females) with a significant tuberculous lesion have been discovered which gives on overall rate of .826 per 1,000 examinees. While the number of men X-rayed during 1962 was approximately the same as the average over the past five years the females aggregate showed a 4.7% increase on the average figure. The rate of significant cases for men produced an overall figure of 1.204, but for women it was only .259. The highest incidence of tubercle was discovered in men within the 45-54 Age Group with the Age Group 20-24 slightly lower. The highest incidence for women was found in the 15-19 Age Group. During the past few years the highest incidence among men has consistently been found among the 45-54 Group, but that for women has varied while remaining below the 34 age limit. Five cases of carcinoma of the lung (all men) were discovered during the year, which is a considerable fall on previous years' results. Unit's Operations The zone of the Unit has remained the City of London, and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch. The Unit operated for eight months at the Mass Radiography Centre, 20, Golden Lane E.C.l., while for the remaining period (excluding the three week period for annual leave) the Unit visited various firms which could offer appropriate accommodation. Commencing on the 1st February 1962 the Unit changed over to the "unnumbered" Record Card, which eliminated the use of the "Personal Details" Form previously employed by this Unit. An appropriate quantity of these Record Cards is now supplied with their programme of appointmentsto firms and organisations. Each card is completed by the examinee prior to his/her arrival at the Unit. This new procedure has been greatly appreciated by firms, etc., as the time spent at the Unit is even less than was previously the case. A special effort was made during the year under review to re-awaken the interest of firms who had not used the Unit's services for some years. A special appeal was sent out to some two thousand firms with quite gratifying results. Continuous endeavour is made to increase the Unit's register of firms. Doctors' Referrals Some of the General Practitioners in our zone make full use of the Unit's services but we would welcome more. There is every indication that this is being achieved during the current year. All doctors are fully advised of the Unit's movements. Doctors' referrals did produce an incident rate of 4.81 per 1,000. 19. Medical Procedure The unit has continued its procedure of referring abnormal cases to the appropriate Chest Clinic via the examinee's own doctor. Clinics have recorded their sputum findings and fourteen cases with a positive sputum have been reported of which thirteen were male and one female. Conclusion Throughout the year friendly and helpful relationships have existed between the Unit and Dr. J. Greenwood Wilson, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, the Medical Officers of Health for the Boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch and the Divisional Medical Officers of Divisions 3, 4 and 5. Grateful acknowledgment must be made to Dr. Neville C. Oswald, Dr. Graham Hayward and their colleagues at St. Bartholomew's Hospital for their helpfulness over cases outside the scope of a Chest Clinic; to the Central Group Hospital Management Committee and the Regional Hospital Board for their willing assistance at all times; and finally to all members of the Unit staff for their loyalty and support. 20. SHOREDITCH TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE I am grateful to Mrs. J.M. Rix, the Secretary, for the following report of Care Work for the year from April 1962, to March, 1963. "Members of Care Committee Councillor F.G. Aldred (Chairman) Shoreditch Borough Council Miss R. Glennie (Vice Chairman) Soldier's, Sailor's & Airmen's Families Association. The Rev. Meredith Davies M.B.E. L.C.C. Health Committee Dr. S. King Divisional Medical Officer. Dr. B. Broadbent Medical Officer of Health, Shoreditch. Mrs. W.G. Dibble Women's Voluntary Services. Miss M.W. Sweeney Superintendent - Shoreditch & Bethnal Green District Nursing Association. Miss Hartigan Almoner - St. Leonard's Hospital. Councillor J.D. Welch Shoreditch Brough Council. Ex-Officio: Dri W.F. Richards Chest Physician. Miss M.D.M. Nutt Health Visitor. Mrs. D.M. Burke Health Visitor. Mrs. J.M. Rix Care Committee Organiser. The past twelve months have been one of change for the Committee. In November 1962, Mrs. Rix joined the staff at the Chest Clinic as Welfare Officer and took over the Secretaryship of the Care Committee. Our thanks go to Miss Nutt who had been doing this work in addition to her own, in the absence of a permanent Secretary. The other major change was the Committee's decision in May 1962 to form a money raising sub-committee. This small committee, under the chairmanship of Councillor Welch, took upon itself the formidable task of making good the deficit in income caused by the drop in Seal Sales over the past few years. However, the enthusiasm and hard work of this committee in the first few months of its existence, resulted in just over £100 being added to the Fund. A large part of this sum was raised through a swimming Gala which was held at the Haggerston Public Baths. This event proved to be so popular that it is hoped that it will become an annual event. A beautiful shield, given by Mr. Barnes-Oak, a member of the sub-committee, will be held by the winning team for one year. We are greatly indebted to Councillor Welch and his Committee. The Seal Sale resulted in £128 being paid into the Fund after expenses had been deducted. Other donations included - Sunday Cinemas £45, United Charities of St. Leonard £10. Rotary Club of Shoreditch £5 and Hoxton Schools Treatment Centre £50. We are most grateful to these donors. " 21. Our work has been as always, an attempt to alleviate financial distress among our patients and their families. We are indebted to the many voluntary organisations which have helped us in this task. These include S.S.A.F.A., The Forces Help Society, The Glasspool Trust, The Benevolent Society of St. Patrick, N.S.C.R., The Chest & Heart Association and the W.V.S. Typical cases have been those needing help with rent and H.P. Arrears, wireless and television rentals and licences, coal, clothing, holidays and fares to enable relatives to visit patients in hospitals and sanatoria. We were also able to distribute £20 amongst our elderly patients at Christmastime. The letters of thanks received were proof of how much this was appreciated by them. Finally we would like to record our thanks to the Auditor, also to the Borough Treasurer and Mr. Kirtland for their kindness in preparing and auditing the accounts. SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES. The various services provided for the welfare of old people continued to function throughout the year and the four full time old people's clubs again proved very popular places where the pensioners can meet their friends to sit and talk in comfort, play games, listen to wireless or television, and find from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. that companionship which so many of them lack in their homes. The premises occupied by Moorfields Club were sold in September for redevelopment of the site, but fortunately accommodation was found nearby at St. Michael's Church Hall and the club soon settled in the new surroundings and membership began to increase. Use has been made of the Council's small coach to transport some of the crippled and in-active pensioners to and from the clubs daily and at the time of writing 11 old people are being given this opportunity to enjoy the club amenities. The improvement in their condition is already unbelievable. The special club concert given at Hoxton Hall every Friday afternoon still attracts a big attendance. I am sorry to have to report that the Council's Holiday Home at Copthorne continued to experience great difficulty in obtaining sufficient staff to function satisfactorily and eventually the position became so impossible that it had to be closed at the end of September. However negotiations are proceeding for the purchase of a Holiday Hotel at the seaside and the Council will be able to provide holidays for Shoreditch O.A.P.'s and some of the poorer families next year. A great stride forward was made in the "Meals on wheels" service in November, when following several complaints regarding the quality of the meals served, the Council's staff canteen agreed to undertake the supply. This proved very popular and the number of meals served at clubs, and by W.V.S. and Salvation Army to homebound folk, rose by the end of the year to 120 per day and is still increasing. 22. Our three lady visitors maintained their good work of visiting the old people and arranging for any of the countless services available to be provided where needed. Over 4,400 visits were made. A reasonably comprehensive list of amenities provided directly by the Borough Council,(through my department) for old people in the Borough includes free baths, free chiropody (though 4/- at home), clubs, (full and part-time) with almost every amenity, home visiting (twice annually to every pensioner by one visitor, and for emergencies, etc. by one of the three visitors), assisted holidays, free laundry facilities for the incontinent, l0d.mid-day two-course meals both at clubs and for the homebound (22,000 in all), provision of bedding, clothing, furniture, etc. where needed, Christmas parcels (670), Christmas dinner (and 2 weeks at Copthorne for 30,as well as Club dinner for 400), Church Service at St. Paul's Cathedral, clothes mending at one club, redecorating of premises, entertainments, talent competition, exhibition of handicrafts (and annual sale of work also), assistance with fuel, Harvest festival gifts distribution, home nursing requisites (including 20 wheel chairs), library books delivered to housebound, assistance with ophthalmic and dental services where needed, lowering of gas and electric meters where needed, a regular shoe repair service (free, by Lion Boys' Club) S.O.S. cards for pensioners living alone, summer outings for both active and housebound groups, various goods at reduced prices or free, wireless for the bedridden, legal aid assistance - and in fact other help such as collection of pensions for housebound and almost every possible assistance in any form of difficulty. Birthday cards and Christmas cards are sent to all club members, even if in hospital at the time. Since 1953 a register of all known pensioners has been kept and has remained fairly constant at about 4,000, despite the fact that we are able to keep up-to-date on all deaths and removals, while at the same time not receiving information of new pensioners unless and until they need help (or unless they are discovered during the routine street-by-street six monthly visits to the whole Borough). In addition to these services, and in very close liaison with our own welfare visitors, the pensioners receive a great deal of help from the District Nursing Association, the L.C.C. Home Help Service (incidentally, by local arrangement the L.C.C. Health Visitors pass on to our visitors any old age pensioners who apply to them for help), the staff of St. Matthew's (geriatric) Hospital, and of course the National Assistance Board. We have appreciated the help given by the W.V.S. and Salvation Army in distributing meals-on-wheels in Council-owned vehicles, and we are indebted to the City of London and East London Dispensary Fund for £275 towards the salary of the full-time visitor., 23. The number of persons who attended the Shoreditch Holiday and Rest Home at Copthorne during 1962 were as follows:- Adults 97 10-18 years 17 5-10 years 48 9 months - 5 years 73 Under 9 months 13 Old Age Pensioners 225 Conference members - Total 473 The following table shows the average attendances at the Old People's Clubs during the year (1) (2) (3) Old People's Clubs Average number of attendances Av. weekly No. of Mon.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES Before detailing sanitary circumstances under its various headings, certain significant features of the part of the Report worthy of special mention are herewith summarised. Staff. As a complete contrast to the gloomy preamble of last year's Report which underlined the difficulties of carrying out important duties due to a depleted staff of Public Health Inspectors, it is a pleasure to report that owing to the determined efforts of the Council, for the first time for over a decade on January 1st 1962 a full complement of Public Health Inspectors had been established. At the beginning of the year the prospect of being able to complete a full programme of basic routine inspections of all premises in the Borough considered to be the very foundation of the Public Health Inspectors' work was for the first time for many years a practical possibility, and assisted by the use of pocket tape recorders and making full use of the Public Health Inspectors' technical abilities ultimately reducing clerical and paper work to a minimum, it is with humble pride one is able to report that one hundred per cent basic routine inspections of all premises in the Borough have been completed for the first time for many years. Having a full complement of Public Health Inspectors including a nucleus of well experienced Public Health Inspectors it is now possible to continue with an extensive and comprehensive scheme of training for Student Public Health Inspectors.) We now have three Students in the Department, two of whom will sit for the Public Health Inspectors Examination in 1963 and one in 1964. The Prevention and Suppression of Excessive Noise. Under this subject, of significant importance is the fact that during the year, Shoreditch Borough Council became the first local authority in the country to resolve that in any future contracts let out by them a clause shall be included limiting the noise of road breakers and preventing all excessive unnecessary noise from them. A great deal of investigation and research work has been carried out by the Chief Public Health Inspector in very close liaison with manufacturers and users of road breaking equipment, and further important research work in this direction has already been organised to take place during 1963, details of which are fully enumerated in the body of this section of the Annual Report. Atmospheric Pollution. Under this subject of paramount importance are two features (a) the confirmation and operation of two further Smoke Control Orders within the Borough and the submission of a third Smoke Control Order to the Minister for 25. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES (Contd.) confirmation, the speed of progress in this direction exceeding the original Smoke Control programme, and (b) investigations and research work carried out in respect of 648 heavy vehicles passing through Shoreditch during the year. Once again details of this work will be fully elaborated in the body of this Report. Mechanical Aids for Public Health Inspectors. The policy of introducing tape recorders in the Department for the use of each Public Health Inspectorin an effort to take full advantage of his technical abilities and at the same time reduce the amount of clerical work to a minimum, has proved successful, and there can be no doubt that where Public Health Inspectors are properly trained in the use of this equipment, their work can be carried out more efficiently and more pleasantly (particularly in inclement weather) and output of Public Health Inspectors work is very considerably increased. Another mechanical aid recently applied to the Department is known as a "Revealer". This instrument fully described under the Rodent Section of this Report is capable of locating the run, depth and diameter of any drain, and has already been used by the Public Health Inspectors, solving problems in a few minutes which hitherto could only be solved by methods of trial and error at an exorbitant cost. Housing Act 1961. Whilst the Housing Act 1961 became operative towards the end of 1961, the problem of dealing with houses in multiple occupation which are in a squalid state does not present a serious problem in this Borough. In only a few instances has the Act been applied and in each case success has been achieved by making informal approaches to the owners of the premises in accordance with the spirit of the Minister's Circular. Food Administration. The employment of a Senior Food Inspector in the Department since January 1962 has resulted in full basic routine inspections of all food premises in the Borough being made this year. It is the first time that this has been achieved for many years together with a one hundred per cent programme of food sampling. The growing tendency for the use of chemical additives to foodstuffs has not gone unnoticed by the Department and plans are being formulated to concentrate on this work during the coming year. The use of pesticides and their effect on foodstuffs has also been noted and this too will have considerable attention in the near future. 26. NOISE ABATEMENT A great deal of research and investigation has been done during the year in the prevention and suppression of unnecessary and excessive noise,particularly from road breakers. This work has been widely publicised both by the B.B.C. and the I.T.V. authorities, in the B.B.C. overseas broadcasts, in the national press and in professional journals. On the representations of the Chief Public Health Inspector in September this year the Council decided to include in all future contracts let out by them a clause limiting the amount of noise from road breakers. It is believed that Shoreditch is the only local authority in the country to adopt this measure and already many enquiries are being made from other local authorities for advice on this important subject. The result of Shoreditch Borough Council's determination to reduce the noise from road breakers in the Borough has had repercussions far beyond our expectations and at least one firm have produced a prototype model which will soon be on the market of an entirely new design which will surpass the amount of work done by any existing type of road breaker at a very much reduced noise level. Advice was sought by the firm from this Department as to various details of manufacture which have been incorporated in the design. Hereunder is quoted extracts from a Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector of demonstrations and trials which have taken place throughout the year in connection with this important subject. In April this year, invitations were extended to engineers of the four statutory undertakings (exempt from the Noise Abatement Act), together with representatives of local authorities, manufacturers of equipment and many other interested parties, to witness that a dramatic reduction in noise can be achieved with the loss of little efficiency using silencers (muffle covers) on road breaking equipment. These tests proved that a dramatic reduction in noise,more than 50%, with a loss of efficiency of not more than 10% could be achieved. As a result of the publicity given to this work, a well known firm of electric road breakers issued a challenge that their electric road breaker would hold its own and perhaps surpass the performance of any pneumatic road breaker,with less noise,even when the pneumatic road breaker is provided with a silencer. It was therefore arranged for the electric road breaker to compete against the pneumatic road breaker in Shoreditch,on the hardest section of road which could be found. The electric road breaker surpassed the performance of the pneumatic road breaker, at the same time doing the work at a much reduced noise level. The publicity given to this demonstration aroused certain manufacturers of pneumatic road breakers who made very strong representations, requesting that they may be allowed to provide their best equipment and compete against the electric road breaker which had done so well in the previous demonstration. This was agreed and the competition took place in Shoreditch on 23rd August 1962. The electric road breaker and two pneumatic road breakers commenced 27. operations at the same time and each dug out 16 square feet, the time being taken for the work. Noise pressure readings were taken. The table given below enumerates the amount of noise produced and the time taken to complete the work by each appliance. Appliance Sound Recordings in Dbs Times Breaking surface Beneath surface Time Total time in minutes at 4' at 20' at 4' at 20' started finished No. 1 Pneumatic Road Breaker 92.5 84 95 86 11.50am 12.21pm 31 No.2. Pneumatic Road Breaker 102 89 98 91.5 II 12.22pm 32 No. 3. Electric Road Breaker 90 78 92 80 fl 12o20pm 30 The decibels readings are extremely intricate to evaluate, therefore their meanings are amplified thus 60 decibels is 10 times noisier than 50 decibels 70 decibels is 100 times noisier than 50 decibels 80 decibels is 1000 times noisier than 50 decibels In breaking the surface, the noise made by the pneumatic road breaker with built-in silencer was almost twice that of the electric road breaker and the pneumatic road breaker with muffle cover was fourteen times noisier» At 20 feet distance, with the chisels beneath the surface, the muffled breaker was fifteen times noisier than the electric road breaker, and the other pneumatic road breaker was four times noisier than the electric road breaker. The electric road breaker took 30 minutes to break a 16 square feet against 31 minutes and 32 minutes by the other two competitors, but when one compares the noise made by the electric road breaker with that made by the pneumatic road breakers, it has been established for the second time beyond doubt that so far as performance is concerned the electric road breaker equals that of silenced pneumatic appliances, and produces far less noise for the same amount of work when used to break up concrete roads. It is important to note that the electric roadbreaker which costs £130 can be operated from a 13 amp power point and no expensive compressor (£1000) is required as in the case of the pneumatic road breaker which in itself produces more noise than this road breaker. 28. From the results of this work, I strongly recommend, the Committee to seriously consider making recommendations to the Council that in all future contracts a clause should be inserted restricting road breaking appliances to a reasonable decibel level, thus setting an example to others in this vital field of Public Health, "the prevention and suppression of unnecessary noise". The advent of a new type of road breaker, which incidentally is hydraulically driven by a ten horse power unit is proving of considerable interest. Unlike the compressor this new power unit is so quiet that normal conversation can be carried on immediately adjoining the unit and this has inspired me to arrange for a demonstration to take place some time in the spring between pneumatic road breakers, electric road breakers and this new type of road breaker. Letters have already been sent by the Department to all manufacturers of road breaking equipment inviting them to a round table conference to discuss the whole subject of silencing road breaking equipment, and to take part in a demonstration to be held under the auspices of this Department and with the cooperation of scientific bodies. It is confidently hoped that very valuable information may be obtained from this demonstration and no doubt the manufacturers, bearing in mind the possible outcome of Sir Alan Wilson's Governmental Report sometime in 1963, are fully conscious of the possibility of legal standards becoming law as a result of this report. Ice Cream Chimes. No complaint has been received concerning ice cream chimes being broadcast in contravention of the Noise Abatement Act. No doubt the deterrent of several warning letters and successful prosecutions has had its effect. At the same time the Public Health Inspectors are alert to this vital subject. Other Noise Nuisances. Several complaints of minor noise nuisances have been received during the year but in eachcase informal action has proved to be successful. 29. FOOD ADMINISTRATION Introduction The appointment of a Food and Drugs Specialist in January of this year created the opportunity to implement a more uniform procedure in the Food and Drugs Section of the Department than had hitherto been possible owing to staff shortage. The following summary of the year's activities under precise headings presents the results of the adoption of a system in line with that of the District Public Health Inspector, but adapted to suit the field of Food and Drugs. General Serious adulteration of foods is now a rare occurrence and when discovered it is usually found to be an error rather than an intention to defraudo This change of attitude has undoubtedly been brought about as a result of the combined effect of the following - the higher standard of manufacture of foodstuffs; keen competition in business to produce a good article; public demand for a worthwhile product, and the enforcement of food legislation# The foregoing is no reason to suppose that the work of the Food and Drugs Section has been lightened; on the contrary, the increase in the number of chemicals used in foods has imposed another responsibility upon that Section of the Health Department whose duty it is to endeavour to see that thes’e new additions are not used in any other way than is prescribed by legislation. 'Keen competition in business' is sometimes interpreted as justifying actions which call for an alertness on the part of the Food and Drugs Staff to detect the reason for differences between Grades I and II, to study price range in relation to quality, and such methods of trading as could be regarded as misleading to the consumer. Some pesticides promote such healthy growth of crops and reduce wastage that they seem likely to be a permanent feature of agriculture. Unfortunately some of these pesticides are not only toxic to the pests against which they are used but may also constitute a danger to man if applied incorrectly. The number of illnesses which may be transmitted by food is large and many foods may be the vehicle of these diseases, the most important of which are meat and meat products, milk products and shellfish. To add to this there is now the unknown cumulative effects of additives, antibiotics, pesticides and suppressants. Legislation to safeguard the purchaser has to be administered and enforced which requires a little different technique than was hitherto employed. New Legislation Of the various and sundry new food legislation issued during the year the following are worthy of special mention. 30, FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd). The Preservatives in Food Regulations 1962. These Regulations became operative on 26th July 1962 and re-enact with amendments the Public Health (Preservatives in Food) Regulations 1925-58. The main provisions are contained in the new schedule which is more comprehensive and tabulates changes in the list of permitted preservatives and extends the specified foods which may contain those preservatives. The Regulation also provides that where certain food is certified by a Public Analyst as containing any preservative not permitted by these Regulations, that food may be treated as being unfit for human consumption. Lead in Food Regulations 196l. These Regulations became operative on 16th April 1962 and restrict the amount of lead which may be present in food and beverages intended for human consumption* The new schedule lists many specified foods and beverages with prescribed limits of lead. All other foods are subject to a maximum of 2.0 parts per million by weight. Two years after the date upon which these Regulations became operative, the limits are to be reduced in relation to certain specified foods. The Labelling of Food Order 1953 arid Amendments to 1962. These take on a new significance when considering the interpretation of 'ingredients' in relation to the required 'true statement'. Additives in the form of preservatives, antibiotics and suppressants are ingredients and their presence should be disclosed on labels or packages. The Emulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food Regulations 1962. These Regulations become operative on 14th January 1963 and will control the use of (emulsifiers and stabilisers) any substance other than that of a natural food substance which is capable of aiding the formation of and maintaining the uniform dispersion of two or more substances to increase the appeal of a food to the consumer. (a) No flour intended for sale as such, shall contain any emulsifier or any stabiliser. (b) No bread shall contain any emulsifier or any stabiliser other than those permitted under these Regulations. (c) No cream or reconstituted cream shall contain any thickening substance. - are just some of the requirements contained in this Regulation. Milk. There is no collecting centre, pasteurizing or bottling plant in the Borough. All milk is heat treated and prepacked by one of the three main milk distributing companies before arrival here. In consequence, the milk sampling policy was reviewed at the commencement of the year and directed to be operated under three headings for the purpose of Chemical and Bacteriological Sampling. General - to include shops and roundsmen. Schools - monthly samples. Vending machines - spot sampling. General Schools Vending Machines Total Chemical 45 5 4 54 Bacteriological 22 8 1 31 67 13 5 85 31. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) One informal sample under the General heading was reported as being deficient in milk fat, the milk was described as raw Kedassia, produced and bottled outside the Borough. The findings of the Public Analyst were communicated to the sampling authority in whose area the farm was situated. Repeat samples were reported as having been taken with results warranting a Ministry rulings Therefore the case was reported as having been put to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. All school milk samples were reported as satisfactory both chemically and bacteriologically, as were the samples taken from vending machines. A little difficulty was being experienced during the early part of the year in getting a satisfactory condition of cleanliness in some of the milk vending machines. This has been overcome and a most commendable standard of hygiene is now being maintained. One complaint of a dirty milk bottle was reported to the Department and appropriate action was taken in respect of the dairy concerned. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations 1960 Dealers and Distributors' Licences under the above Regulations are now valid for five years and details of issuing during the year are as follows. Pasteurized Sterilized T.T.(Pasteurized) T.T. New Licences 7 3 5 5 Transf ers 6 6 3 Totals 13 9 8 5 Ice Cream The table of bateriological reports on the twenty seven ice cream samples taken during the year calls for explanatory comment - Wherever a provisional grade below II was reported on a sample, investigations into possible causes were instituted the Food and Drugs Section, suggestions put forward and acted upon and repeat samples taken until a satisfactory result was obtained. The most prevalent cause for unsatisfactory results was found to be the condition of the serving implements in connection with ready mixed ice cream. It is hoped that a more constant level of high grade ice cream will be maintained as a result of this year's investigations. Bacteriological Reports on Ice Cream Samples Grade I Grade II Grade III Grade IV 13 4 9 1 32. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Food Hygiene. Through the years, certain basic principles and procedures have been developed for use in the application of food hygiene. It has long been realised that people need good food for good health, and food spoilage can be the product of poor hygiene. The Food Hygiene Regulations illustrate proper steps to be taken to minimise the potential hazards against which adequate safeguards must be taken at all stages of preparation, distribution and sale. It has not been found necessary to serve any informal or formal notices for breaches of these Regulations; the hygiene standard in food premises in the Borough in general has shown a steady improvement and is being maintained. Through direct and indirect advice sought from and recommendations given by the Food and Drugs Section, no less than six establishments have effected such major improvements as will go to illustrate beyond doubt the effect of the public health education resulting from regular routine visits and personal contact. The vexing problem of the traditional open shop front has not escaped the attention of the Food and Drugs Section. The presence of stalls on the streets which have shops adopting this practice is an instrumental factor that creates this type of trading. The shopkeeper imagines that he is the victim of unfair trading competition. Very little can be done to discontinue this practice without specific legislation. However a keen watch was kept to see that certain standards of hygiene were maintained. Reference was made last year to the regrettable legal position in relation to punishment for the offence of smoking whilst handling open food. Difficulties in the field in connection with the administration of this particular piece of legislation cannot be expected to be eased when support is not forthcoming from the source from which it should. Six instances of employees in food premises and food stalls found to be smoking whilst handling open food were reported to the Public Health Committee. In four cases warning letters were sent and the remaining two offenders were prosecuted. 1 conditional discharge and costs £3. 3. 0d. 1 fined 10/- and costs 10/- It is hoped that the resolution passed by the appropriate committee and communicated to the Street Traders' Association whereby the Council reserve the right to review the position regarding the renewal of the licence of any street trader convicted on a second occasion of an offence which could render the applicant unsuitable will have the desired effect. 33. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Routine Inspections There are 925 types of food businesses and food stalls in Shoreditch designated as follows:- Cafes and Restaurants 102 Dining Clubs & School Meals Service 26 Factory & Warehouse Canteens 89 Ice Cream Shops 110 Butchers Shops and Stalls 42 Milk Shops and Depots 78 Fried Fish Shops 9 Wet Fish Shops 7 Bakers 17 Food Warehouses 15 Grocery & Provision Shops 92 Confectioners’ Shops 86 Public Houses 108 Food Stalls 93 Coffee Stall 1 Greengrocers 28 Chemis ts 16 Off Licences 6 The number of routine Inspections made to all premises in the Borough which are in any way connected with the preparation, distribution, handling, storage, or sale of food were as follows - Basic routine inspections made 2738 (100%) Re-inspections made 808 Total number of inspections 3546 34. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) The sampling of foodstuffs for Chemical examination 219 samples were submitted for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst during 1962. Details are as follows:- Almond Oil 2 Marzipan 2 Baking powder 2 Meat paste 4 Butter 6 Meat products Cheese Spread 1 Canned 3 Chocolate liqueurs 1 Meat products Coffee extract (Pies) 4 Confectionery flour 5 Medicated pastilles 1 Confectionery Sugar 1 Medicines 2 Cooking Pat 1 Milk 54 Cod-liver oil capsules 1 Milk, Dried 1 Cough Linctus 1 Mincemeat 3 Cream (sterilised) 1 Oil, cooking 1 Curry powder Oil, olive 1 Dessert powder 1 Paraffin, Medicinal 1 Drinks, Soft 5 Peel, Candied 3 Dripping 1 Quinine, Ammoniated Pish Cakes 1 tincture of 1 Pish Paste 6 Quinine and cinnamon Plavouring essence 13 tablets 1 Flour 2 Rum 1 Fruit, Canned 2 Saccharin tablets 1 Fruit fillings 2 Sauce 2 Fruit syrups 5 Sausages 11 Gin 4 Spice (nutmeg) 2 Ginger, Ground 1 Suet, Shredded 4 Halibut-liver oil capsules 1 Soup preparation 1 Ice Cream 7 Treacle 1 Ice lolly 1 Vegetables, canned 4 Iron and yeast tablets 1 Vinegar 2 Jam Vinegar, imitation 3 Jelly tablet 1 Whisky 4 Lard 1 Wine, Alcoholic 3 Margarine 5 Zinc & Castor Oil Cream 1 Marmalade 1 Zinc Ointment 1 35. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) 10 were notified as being non genuine by the Public Analyst and action was taken as follows:- Details Results Action taken Glycerin & Blackcurrant Pastilles. Proportion of glycerin (2%) was considered too small to justify the description. Letter sent to manufacturers drawing attention to recommended "Code of Practice". Milk, Kedassia Deficiency of 6% milk fat. Result of informal sample communicated to Local Authority in whose area farm is situated. Shredded Beef Suet (2) Contained less than 83% fat (81.8% and 79%) Follow up formal samples taken contained 83$ fat. Malt Vinegar Contained salt 1%, the presence of which was not disclosed on the label. Letter sent to manufacturer pointing out requirements of Labelling of Food Order 1953, Part II. Vinegar Sample was not vinegar but consisted of Water 98.7% Acetic Acid 1.1% Caramel colouring a small quantity. Vendor prosecuted. Fined £35 and five guineas costs. (Previous conviction)0 Instant Coffee (2) Contained sulphur dioxide 400 and 450 ppm. Foreign product.Importer notified and agreed to withdraw from sale all tins from particular consignment recognised by coding. Marzipan (2) Contained sorbic acid the presence of which was not disclosed on the label. Manufacturers notified of omission, replied that correction to label would be made. 36. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) The sampling of food stuffs for Bacteriological examination Samples of foodstuffs were submitted for bacteriological examination. Details as follows:- Ice Cream Soda (Soft Drink) (2) pH.3.8 Water Ice 2.6 Ice Lollie 3.0 Ice Lollie 3.2 Banish Mussels in solution 3.8 Ready cooked Winkles - No pathogenic organisms isolated. (it is generally accepted that where a commodity has a pH value of 4*5 or less, it is considered bacteriologically satisfactory as it is indicative of sufficient acidity to make heat treatment unnecessary)® Four of the sundry samples taken for bacteriological examination were in connection with suspected food poisoning enquiries.In neither examination was anything revealed that could incriminate either of the products thought to be causative agents. Details of Unsound Food No instance occurred during 1962 which required seizure of unfit food. All food found upon inspection to be unfit for human consumption was voluntarily surrendered. Certain commodities were allowed to go forward for technical processes under guarantee that no portion would be used for any other purpose whatsoever. Herewith is a list of surrendered unsound foodstuffs:Apricot Pulp 5 tins, 15 kilos; Beans 23 tins; Beef 8l lbs; Beef Loaf 14 tins; Beetroot 1 jar; Bigos 1 tin; Biscuits 87 packets; Brussels Sprouts, Frozen 23 pkts; Cake Mix 1 packet; Celery 1 tin; Chestnut Puree 3 tins, Chestnut Spread 1 lb 1 ozo 7 tins; Chewing Gum 135 packets; Chicken Fillets, Frozen, 7 packets; Chicken Pies, Frozen 5, Chicken Tinned, 49 tins; Chocolate 152 bars, Chocolate Spread, 1 pot; Cooking Fat 8 packets; Corned Beef 105 tins; Corned Mutton 17 tins; Cornflakes 48 packets; Cranberries 420 grams.s Cream 6 oz; Creamed Rice 4 tins; Coffee 1 tin; Cucumbers 331 jars, 23 barrels; Drink, Fruit 1 bottle, Duck, Boned 1 tin; Flour 112 lbs.; Fruit Syrup l8l bottles; Fruit tinned 10 tins; Fish Tinned 5 tins; Garden Peas, Frozen 25 packets; Gammon 919 lbs.; Gherkins 1 jar; Goulash 9 tins; Ham 57 lbs. 48 tins; Irish Stew 14 tins; Jellied Veal 19 tins; Kidneys 105 lb. 4 tins; Lentils 56 lb.; Liver 52½ lb; Liver Sausage 120 lbs.;Margarine 12 packets; Luncheon Meat 144 tins; Meat Tinned 17 tins; Mushrooms 4 tins;Pepper 1 lb 5 oz.; Pease Pudding 15 tins; Pineapple Pieces 6 lb. 8 oz.; Pork 77 lbs.; Pork Cutlets 7 lb. 4 oz., 9 tins; Potato Chips, Frozen 10 packets; Puff Pastry 4 packets (frozen).;Milk, evaporated, 5 tins; Raisins 13 lb.; Salt 8 packets, 5 bags, 13 blocks; Sauce 1 jar; Sausages 34 tins, 404 lb.,; Salmon 127 lb.,89 tins; Skate 5 stone; Sauerkraut 24 tins 20 jars; Spam 2 tins; Steak Fillets, Frozen 42 packets; Fish Fillets, Frozen 50 packets; Sausage Rolls 3 packets; Potato Crisps 3 packets; Lollipops 44., Sugar 16 lb.; Shoulder Cooked 1034 lb. 3 oz.; Spaghetti 12 packets; Stewed Steak 4 tins; Tea 3¾ lb.; Tea Bags 240 Bags; Tomatoes Tinned 218 tins; Tomatoes Whole 10 lb.15 oz.; Polish Sausages 3518 lb.; Tomato Paste 23 tins, 51 tubes; Tongue 7 lb., 17 tins; Soup 1 tin, 1 packet; Tripes 1 tin; "Vegetables 8 tins; Pies, 7; Wiejska 28 lb.: 37 FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Pharmacy and. Poisons Act 1933. Thirty four licences under the above Act were renewed during the year and three new licences were granted. Regular observations and routine visits were made to shops and stalls for unauthorised sellers. One minor infringement was observed during the year - one of the prescribed disinfectants was exhibited for sale from a stall in a market. When the attention of the licensed shopkeeper, who was also the stall owner, was drawn to the offence being committed, the commodity was immediately withdrawn, apologies were tendered and no further action was considered necessary. Pharmacy and Medicines Act 1941. Observations were kept in connection with the requirements under the above Act and no contraventions were noted during the year. Merchandise Marks Act 1926. There were no contraventions of the above Act during the year and strict observation was kept of all food premises and stalls in the Borough in relation to this subject. Food Complaints. All instances reported to the Department by members of the public involving complaints of the condition of food stuffs were dealt with to the satisfaction of all concerned. In some instances the complainants' unwillingness to testify in court has prevented the instituting of proceedings, although the means to the end does not always lie in the direction of the courts. Complaint Result of Action Taken Foreign body in slice of corned beef. Foreign body bore striking resemblance to the material which is used for wiping down surfaces in manufacturing premises - Importers interviewed. Suggestion made that manufacturer's attention be drawn to complaint and more strict precautions taken. 58. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Food Complaints (Contd.) Complaint Result of Action Taken Mouldy condition of pork pie (Thorough investigation made in relation to this complaint. Manufacturer's explanation was that interpretation of coding made it impossible for purchase to be made when stated. Small piece of rubber in frozen chopped spinach Manufacturers notified of complaint. Satisfactory explanation received. Piece of wood embedded in loaf of bread Bake-house was well maintained. Rather old pieces of plywood in close proximity to dough mixer to be renewed and flour sifter to be installed. Warning letter sent. Suspected unsoundness of chocolate sponge roll. Submitted for chemical analysis - nothing deleterious was detected - chocolate slightly bitter. Letter to manufacturers - satisfactory reply received. Small piece of foil in crust of loaf. Investigation at Bakery failed to reveal any similar type of foil - Bakehouse maintained in clean condition. Flour sifter operated. Small fly in cake Letter sent to Bakery Company. Representative of Bakers inspected cake - the precautions taken to prevent the ingress of flies to be checked. Complainant reimbursed. Hairy substance in meat pie. Submitted for analysis - hairy substance was piece of hairy hide - letter sent to manufacturer.Representative called to office. Strong warning letter sent. Area of discolouration in loaf of bread(2) Wrapped bread was sold as delivered from bakery. Area complained of was mixture of ingredients normally found, in wholemeal bread - no further action. 39. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Food Complaints (Contd.) Complaint Result of Action Taken Icing on wedding cake was sour and cake stale. The standard of cake was lower than normally expected and icing was discoloured. Investigation into baking process made and samples of ingredients analysed cake was substandard only. Suspected Cream Soda (Soft Drink) Control sample purchased and submitted with suspected sample for chemical and bacteriological examination. Nothing abnormal reported from either laboratory. Peculiar taste to butter. Sample submitted for chemical examination - nothing abnormal reported. Localized abscess in shoulder of lamb. Abscess was encapsulated in thick membrane, appearance of musculature was normal. No visible signs to indicate presence of abscess. Unsound can of corned beef. Decomposition had commenced, no external evidence of cause. Remainder of stock appeared satisfactory. Cigarette end embedded in loaf of bread. Condition of bakehouse in general was well maintained. Baker prosecuted. Fined £10 and £3.3.0d. costs. Piece of string embedded in slice of bread. Bakery was well maintained - staff had been instructed to hand sieve flour before use. Automatic sifter to be installed. Warning letter sent. Suspected vinegar Sample submitted for chemical examination found to be non brewed condiment below standard requirements. Vendor prosecuted, fined £35 and £5.5.Od costs (previous conviction). Piece of wood embedded in loaf of bread. Bakehouse in general was well maintained, but inspection revealed worn and broken condition of oven "peels", Baker prosecuted fined £5 and £3.3.0d. costs. 40. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Food Complaints (Contde) Complaint Result of Action Taken Foreign body in loaf of bread. Discovered to be part of a bus ticket. Strong warning letter sent to Bakery Company. Suspected apple slices. Three people complained of having diarrhoea after eating apple slices purchased from bakers shop. Bakery visited and found to be maintained in satisfactory condition. Samples of ingredients submitted for examination# Nothing abnormal discovered. 1 <4 Cold Storage. During March 1962 a Cold Storage Company became operative in the Borough, the first of its kind, receiving foreign carcase meat," cartoned jointed meat, offal, poultry and other foreign foods by road transport from the ports. The liaison between these ports and the Food and Drugs Section assures that notification is received of the arrival of all consignments. Inspections are carried out and where necessary percentage examinations. The contents of sealed refrigerated containers from Yugoslavia via Harwich are received into cold storage chambers. During the examination of these consignments of jointed pork nothing abnormal has been discovered, the quality and packaging is always very good. Forward notice is received from port authorities of any imported food product destined for the cold store which is thought to require further attention. One such Uruguayan consignment of 580 quarters of beef and 900 sides of veal contaminated by mould was given 100% examination and classified according to the evidence of mould into either manufacturing or animal feeding quality and dealt with accordingly. Prepacking Mussels. Investigations into the source from whence a quantity of mussel shells, dumped on waste ground, could have come, revealed certain information which justified further inquiries. It was discovered that as a result of remarks passed by a Billingsgate Fish Market porter to the effect that "there was money in it" and that he could "find a buyer", a scrap metal dealer had purchased two bags of mussels, a quantity of jars and caps, and had started up in the business of prepacking mussels in his junk yard and had disposed of the shells on the adjacent waste ground. 41. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd.) Fortunately production had not long started when the discovery was made and no deliveries had taken place. When it was pointed out to the 'would-be producer' that certain conditions were required under legislation before he would be permitted to continue ixi this type of business, he immediately decided to discontinue, and nothing of a similar nature has been carried on since. bo-operating with Police. Following is an interesting example of how the multifarious duties of the Public Health Inspector, the bounds of which are unlimited, can be utilised to the general advantage of other public bodies. The conduct of some of the people frequenting one of the cafes in the Borough came under suspicion by the police. The limitations of their powers of entry restricted the furtherance of their enquiries so the co-operation of the Chief Public Health Inspector was enlisted. A complete inspection of these premises was carried out by "two officials from the Health Department" and the result played an important part in the outcome of the case against offenders, prosecuted and convicted for illicit trafficking in harmful drugs. In Conclusion. It is true to say that every new development brings in its train some obstacle which has to be overcome.The year has seen the commencement of a system in the Food and Drugs Section which it is hoped will confine the problems involved in keeping up to date, to within manageable limits.The existance of different trends of thought on the approach to a particular problem is perhaps inevitable, but the interpretation of usefulness in relation to research in any field should be a point upon which agreement should not differ. It is only by exploring every avenue that positive facts are revealed. Even negative results have a positive bearing and are just as vital in the process of elimination. It is logical to agree that unless the ultimate product of any research work results in something tangible no purpose has been served, but anything that helps to forestall an anticipated problem even by eliminating possibilities is surely serving some useful purpose. To isolate organisms is laboratory work, whereas methods of investigations into possible sources of contamination and infection are best operated by field staff and an amicable combination of the two should resolve itself into satisfactory results. 42. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Smoke Control Areas. Two Smoke Control Orders became operative during the year (a) the Shoreditch (Pitfield) Smoke Control Order was confirmed on 14th March 1961 and became operative on 1st June 1962, and (b) the Shoreditch (Wenlock) Smoke Control Order was confirmed on 26th December 1961 and became operative on 1st September 1962. As a matter of interest there were no objections to either of these Orders. About one third of the Borough is now subject to Smoke Control Orders, and it is considered that progress in the adaptation and replacement of fireplaces in the areas confirmed is progressing to satisfaction. The attitude of occupiers of premises in the Areas in operation is most encouraging and the only complaints received by the Department concern the lack of choice and supply of premium fuels. Another real problem is the lack of storage accommodation for fuel in the majority of dwellings in this Borough, and what is considered to be exorbitant prices of prepacked fuel in small quantities. The details of the number of applications for adaptations and replacement of fireplaces in the confirmed Areas together with the number of conversions completed and the number of notices served upon owners and occupiers together with other relevant information which may be useful and interesting is tabulated below. No. of applications for adaptation received 881 No. of conversions completed 385 No. of notices requiring carrying out of adaptations 789 Proposals have been sent to the Minister of Housing and Local Government concerning the establishment of what will be known as the Shoreditch (Hoxton and Kingsland) Smoke Control Order. It was originally intended that this area should be submitted as two proposed Smoke Control Areas, one to become operative in 1963 and the other in 1964 but in order to hasten the complete smoke control programme of the Borough it has been possible to combine these two areas into one Smoke Control Area to become operative on November 1st 1963. By the end of the year one objection concerning the price of smokeless fuels had been received to the proposed Area, which was submitted to the Minister, confirmation being expected early in the New Year. When this proposed Area becomes operative then at least two thirds of the Borough will be fully smoke controlled and it is estimated that the whole of the Borough will be under smoke control by 1965. This would be two years in advance of the original programme as submitted to the Minister, thus completing the programme in five years instead of seven. 43. No. 1. Shoreditch (Hyde Road) S.C.O. Operative 1st September, 1959 No. 2. Shoreditch (Pitfield) S.C.O. Operative 1st June, 1962 No. 3. Shoreditch (Wenlock) S.C.O. Operative 1st September, 1962 44. Atmospheric Pollution from Heavy Vehicles. In their passage to and from the London Docks from all parts of the country it is estimated that almost two million vehicles travel through this concentrated square mile of London every day, and the amount of atmospheric pollution exhausted from these vehicles is a factor of considerable importance to the local authority. As in 1961 the policy of writing to the owners of vehicles observed to be emitting an undue amount of smoke has continued throughout 1962, and the campaign has "been intensified bearing in mind the significance of this work. 648 letters were sent to owners of vehicles during the year, suggesting that the resultant pollution may be due to faulty maintenance and operation of the vehicles concerned, drawing attention to the very serious atmospheric pollution being caused, and inviting their observations and measures they may be taking to alleviate these conditions. The response to these letters has been encouraging and the general attitude of owners is that they welcome any information Public Health Inspectors may be able to supply, concerning the operation of their vehicles, often hundreds of miles from their bases. Many letters of appreciation have been received, and it has been possible to summarise a list of the type of defects which upon examination have been found and remedied. Defective fuel injectors 28 Defective fuel pumps 22 Defective governor diaphragm 1 Defective governor spring 1 Engine change required 2 Defective fuel timing 2 Defective exhaust pipe 1 Cylinder head gasket broken 1 Oil change required 1 Defective carburettor choke 1 Excessive engine wear 1 Defective cylinder valve 1 Dirty air filter 1 Overhaul required 1 Vehicle scrapped 1 There can be no doubt that the amount of time devoted to this work is of real value in our efforts to rid the air of pollution and it is to become an established policy of the Public Health Department of this Borough to continue with the work in the hope that other local authorities may in their wisdom follow our example. The Smog December 1962. During the smog which invaded the London area in December hourly readings of sulphur dioxide and solid pollution were taken during normal working hours. Reference to the charts on the pages 46 & 47 present a very concise picture of the extent of atmospheric pollution as compared with a normal amount of atmospheric pollution taken at a similar period last year when the atmosphere was devoid of fog. 45. Whilst the smog prevailed, the work was carried out in very close liaison with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and the services of the Department offered to Doctor Lawther, Head of the Atmospheric Pollution Department of St.Bartholomew's Hospital, were very enthusiastically accepted by him. At the end of the smog the information collated by this Department was supplied to Doctor Lawther and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and their appreciation of our work has underlined its value. Conferences. (a) The Annual Conference of the National Society for Clean Air held in Harrogate in October was attended by the Vice Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor C. Turner B.E.M., and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. T. H. Marshall, and a full Report was submitted to the Council on the Proceedings of the Conference. (b) Your Delegates also attended the Conferences of Co-operating Bodies on the Prevention of Atmospheric Pollution held in London in May and November. Course of Lectures on Atmospheric Pollution. The Chief Public Health Inspector attended a course of lectures on atmospheric pollution held at the Atmospheric Pollution Department of St. Batholomew’s Hospital. This was considered to be a most excellent course and dealt with the subject of atmospheric pollution in all its branches. Education and Publicity. A great deal of publicity has been given throughout the Borough to assist owners and occupiers in carrying out the provisions of the Clean Air Act. The services of the Women's Advisory Council have been employed in giving lectures and demonstrations, and the results of volumetric measurement air pollution have been exhibited both in the Public Libraries and in the Town Ball in prominent positions for the benefit of the public. It is felt that this visual demonstration of atmospheric pollution has a convincing effect on those who witness it. Every dwelling in the confirmed operative Smoke Control Areas has been visited by members of the Staff during the year, to assist and advise and collate facts concerning the number of appliances converted, the type of fuels being used, and any difficulties experienced. Number of Inspections made 2453 Number of Re-inspections made 1072 Total number of Inspections made 3525 46. 47. 48. HOUSING. Individual Dwellings - Clearance Areas. During the year rapid development has taken place particularly under part V of the Housing Act, and under the five years Slum Clearance Programme, one small clearance area involving five houses has been represented and a Clearance Order in respect of these dwellings was confirmed. Particular progress has been maintained in re-housing the occupants of Whitecross Place, and at the end of the year 67 families had been re-housed from these dwellings leaving only 25 families to be re-housed to complete this part of our Slum Clearance Programme. The 196O-1965 Slum Clearance Programme therefore is virtually completed two years in advance. With increased staff, house to house inspections have again been made and during the year 286 houses were inspected. Whilst it is gratifying, it should be noted that more progress would have been made if it had not been for the fact that the Department was without a Smoke Control Officer for three months during the year, and the District Public Health Inspectors carried out work under the Clean Air Act (which would normally have been carried out by the Smoke Control Officer) at the expense of other district work. At the end of the year the Council were fortunate in obtaining the services of a Smoke Control Officer, and it will be possible again to implement a full programme of house-to-house inspections. Details of Redevelopment during 1962. As some indication of the work involved during 1962 1 Clearance Area was resolved 3 Compulsory Purchase Orders were confirmed involving 195 premises 1 Demolition Order was made 2 Closing Orders were made 36 Undertakings not to re-let until premises were made fit, were accepted. 308 Premises were demolished 249 New flats were completed 597 New flats were in course of erection 286 Routine inspections under Section 3, Housing Act, 1957• Loans and Grants. 3 Applications for loan to repair were received 2 Applications for Standard Improvement Grants were received and approved 6 Applications for Discretionary Improvement Grants were received and approved Underground Rooms During 1962 representations were made to the Public Health Committee resulting in - 2 Closing Orders being made 3 Undertakings being accepted not to re-let until premises rendered fit 49. HOUSING (Continued) Underground Rooms (Continued) 2 undertakings specifying works of repair accepted - undertakings specifying works of repair not accepted 2 underground premises made fit and Orders determined. Derelict sites Derelict sites throughout the Borough still present many problems but gradually are disappearing as new buildings take their place. Their value as parking places for cars, now that parking meters are in operation in Shoreditch, has greatly increased and this automatically results in keeping many sites presentable which would otherwise develop into refuse dumps. Drainage plans All drainage plans submitted to the local authority are perused by the Public Health Inspectors before they are submitted to the appropriate committee for approval. During the year 78 plans were perused and numerous interviews have taken place with architects, builders, owners and others concerned in the works involved. Overcrowding and Preferential Treatment At the end of I96I the number of overcrowded cases on the Public Health Department Register was 56, and the number of cases on the Register for Preferential Treatment on medical grounds was 19. During the year 10 cases of families living in overcrowded conditions were found and added to the Register, and a survey of all premises on the Register revealed that 11 families had been rehoused or had found alternative accommodation themselves. 5 cases were removed from the Preferential Treatment Register. The number of cases remaining on the Overcrowding Register at the end of the year therefore was 55, the number remaining on the Preferential Treatment Register being 14. 37 visits of inspection were made. Rent Act 1957 No applications were received during the year under the Rent Act 1957. Housing Repairs & Rents Act 1954 No applications were made to the local authority under the Housing Repairs & Rents Act 1954 during the year. Housing Act 1961. Houses let in multiple occupation do not present a major problem in this Borough, and in implementing this work regard has been made to the 50. Ministry's Circular No.3/62 in which the Minister advised that only houses of a squalid nature which are let in multiple occupation should receive attention for the time being, although plans should be made as to the future survey of houses let in multiple occupation which do not come in this category. During the year 2 houses let in multiple occupation have been dealt with successfully by the Department, and again following the Minister's requirements that every effort should be made to effect improvement without resort to Statutory Action, in each of these premises a full measure of success has been achieved by informal action. Already negotiations have taken place with several owners of properties in the Borough with a view to providing proper amenities and facilities in houses let in multiple occupation which are not in a squalid condition. Number of inspections made 44 Number of reinspections made 1 Total number of inspections made 45 51. RODENT CONTROL. (Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949). The small number of complaints of rodent infestations throughout the year is a matter of the utmost significance and confirms the wisdom of spending so much time in order that all disused drains are abolished as demolition of premises takes place. This work takes a great deal of the Public Health Inspectors time in ascertaining drainage layouts before the demolition of premises takes place, and supervising the effective sealing of all disused branch drains before the Areas are redeveloped. Once again the evidence of the black rat in Shoreditch is conspicuous by its absence. Sewer Treatments. Whilst a great deal of success had been achieved in the use of Warfarin poison baits in sewers throughout the Borough, at the Ministry's request the policy of the use of Warfarin was discontinued and substituted by direct poisoning with 1081 (Fluoracetamide). All manholes and side entrances throughout the Borough were treated with 1081 three times during the year and a test baiting was carried out immediately before the third treatment in the autumn. The result of this type of sewer treatment has been most successful, and is to be continued during next year. Throughout the whole of the Borough, the test baits at the end of the year revealed no complete takes, and only 168 partial takes in a total of 415 manholes and side entrances. The rat population in the sewers of Shoreditch is greatly reduced and therefore during next year less than 50% of the sewers in the Borough will need to be treated. At the end of next year all manholes and side entrances will be test baited to assess the rat population in the sewers. Sealing of disused branch drains. If all disused branch drains were completely abolished as demolition takes place practically all the breeding grounds for rats would be abolished. Rats do not breed in the sewers but in the disused branch drains. Rats use the sewers as a means of travelling from one place to another in search of food. To do this work assiduously and effectively a great deal of time is spent in preparing plans of existing drainage before premises are demolished. When demolition eventually takes place a great deal of attention is paid to effectively sealing the disused drains and it is the policy in Shoreditch to fill all branch drains with a mixture of lime and sand or cement concrete down to the sewer where it is impossible to enter the sewer and seal off in the sewer. This work is done under the supervision of the Public Health Inspector and takes up a great deal of time. Consideration is being given to the appointment of a non-qualified operative, one with good practical building experience to work under the supervision of Public Health Inspectors to enable the qualified Inspector to devote more time to more important routine Public Health work. 52. The Revealer. An instrument known as a 'Revealer' came to our attention towards the end of the year, which has resulted in the saving of a great number of man hours and expenditure in tracing the run of disused drains which could only otherwise be discovered by hit and miss methods at uneconomic costs. The instrument not only determines the run of disused drains without any excavation being made, but also determines the depth, the diameter of the pipe and the substance with which it is made. These claims at first appear to be fantastic, but in practice the instrument fulfils all the claims of the manufacturers and whilst it has been used for a matter of weeks, it has resulted in a vast saving of time, labour and expense. The Mouse The presence of the mouse in factory and commercial premises is still a matter of concern, still being on the ascendancy. At the end of the year contracts were operative in respect of 75 premises yielding an annual income of £1,714. 31 single treatments were carried out amounting to £216. Once again the mechanical manhole lifting apparatus is responsible for a saving of labour costs of at least REPORT FOR PERIOD 1st JANUARY - 31st DECEMBER 1962.

DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. 15 rooms were disinfected following infectious diseases and for other reasons. 339 rooms were sprayed against vermin. 94 articles were disinfected at the Council's disinfecting station, following infectious diseases. 5394 verminous articles were treated at the Council's Disinfecting Station. No Notice was served in respect of verminous premises. 344 visits were made to premises, 137 in respect of infectious disease enquiries and 207 in respect of vermin. Articles belonging to private firms were disinfected at their request and charges amounting to £6 were made. During the year 268 families were removed to new Council dwellings as compared with 297 in 1961. All furniture is subjected to Hydrogen Cyanide disinfestation and all mattresses are put through the Council's disinfector prior to removal to their new accommodation by private removal contractors under the supervision of the Officers of the Department. Prior to removal the Officers of the Department visit the premises, assess the amount of furniture to be removed, and arrange for the number of removal vans required. On the day of removal an Officer of the Department supervises the placing of all furniture in the vans and arranges for the reception of soft furniture in a room which can be securely locked until tests carried out to ensure that the furniture is clear of Hydrogen Cyanide have proved satisfactory. 28 sites were sprayed to prevent further nuisance from vermin and flies and at the request of the Public Health Inspectors 49 mattresses and other articles were removed for destruction by the Cleansing Department. The measures taken to prevent the breeding of beetles in heating ducts on new Local Authority Estates whilst in construction are a vital duty of the Public Health Inspectors. Personal Cleanliness. The arrangement with Finsbury Borough Council whereby residents of Shoreditch requiring treatment for Scabies, or vermin are sent to that Authority's Cleansing Station at Pine Street, was continued throughout the year. The number of treatments carried out are shown in the following tables:- 55. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION (Contd.) Verminous Persons.

FACTORIES (Factories Act 1957 to 1959) Number of Factories in Shoreditch 1066 Number of (a) Basic Routine Inspections made 2239 (100%) (b) Re-inspections made 890 Total number of inspections made 3129 Whilst the erection of many new factories, offices, garages and petrol filling stations continues in the Borough the numerous small factories, because of lack of accommodation, provide a very serious problem where nothing more than the bare requirements of facilities and amenities for the staff according to the Factories Acts can be provided. The problem of the retention of trade refuse and its disposal in such limited accommodation continues to present a real problem, particularly in Smoke Control Areas where for economic reasons of disposal and the provision of cheap space heating an attempt is made to dispose of these trade wastes in inefficient fireplaces and appliances. Particulars of the administration of the Factories Act, 1957 in the form required by Ministry of Health Circular l/62 are as follows Part 1 of the Act Premises Number on Register Inspections Number of Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted (i) Factories in which Sections 1,2,3,4, & 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 202 183 11 — (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by L.A. 864 2924 213 — (iii) Other premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the L.A.

One must again repeat, that if an obligation were placed on the firms responsible for supplying local authorities with lists of outworkers, to notify the several authorities in which their outworkers reside, it would be to everyone's advantage, and very much reduce the work of the clerical staff of local authorities. 58, Bart VIII of the Act Outworkers Nature of Work Section 110 Section 111 No. of Outworkers in August list r'qd by Section 110 (l)(c) No. of cases of default in sending lists to Council No. Of prosecutions for failure to supply No. of instances of work in unwholesome premises Notices served Prosecutions Wearing apparel (making etc) 366 — — — — — Artificial flowers 15 — — — — — Making of boxes 25 — — — — — Brush making 6 — — — — — Carding of buttons 45 — — — — — Leather goods 28 — — — — — Christmas crackers 13 — — — — — Total 498 — — — — — (b) Rag Flock premises Under the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951, the number of registered premises where filling materials were used at the end of 1961 was 117 and during the year 9 licences were issued in respect of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored.

It will be noted that 100% basic routine inspections of hairdressing establishments were completed. SHOPS. (Shops Act 1950 and London General Powers Act 1958) Total number of shops, wholesale establishments and warehouses subject to the requirements of the Shops Act 1950 and the London General Powers Act 1958, 769. Number of basic routine visits made 2945 (100%) Number of re-inspections made 842 Total number of inspections made 3787 Number of notices served 11 During the year 1 application was made and 1 certificate of exemption was granted in respect of sanitary accommodation. PET ANIMALS ACT 1951 Six premises were licensed under this Act during the year. In 5 cases a considerable business is carried on, mostly in budgerigars and goldfish, but the other one deals on a very small scale only, in pigeons. 15 inspections were made of these premises, and in no case were conditions of the licence being contravened. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT 1952 General observation was kept on the sale of heating appliances to ensure that they complied with the Regulations made under the above-named Act. In several cases the sellers and users of heating appliances requested that their guards be tested. 60. OFFENSIVE TRADES An establishment order under Section 140, Public Health (London) Act,1936, was renewed during the year in respect of the business of Fur Skin Dresser. The number of visits made was 4, WELLS There are 2 wells in use in the Borough. In 1 case the water is used for washing down and cooling purposes and in the other case, which is a factory, the water from the well is used for all purposes. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS Shoreditch has now only one swimming bath (indoor) built in 1904, situated in Whiston Road, Haggerston open all the year round for mixed bathing at all times. (Sunday swimming from May to September only). The pool is 100 long by 35' wide, constructed of blue and white glazed bricks, with a depth of 3.4" at the shallow end, increasing gradually to 6.4" at the deep end, at which there is one 3 metre fixed diving stage and 3 lower fixed boards at each side. The surround is 3' wide, of non-slip tiles and seats rise in tiers from the surround up to the dressing cubicles at the back. The seats which are made of teak, also form clothes lockers for use by children during peak periods. Male and female toilets and foot-baths are situated at each side of the pool at the shallow end. Entry to the pool from the dressing cubicles is via the toilets and footbaths and into the pool by teak steps fitted at each corner. The pool has a capacity of 109,000 gallons continuously filtered through pressure sand filters at the rate of 20,000 gallons per hour, chlorinated and heated to a temperature of 74 degrees F. in winter. Chemical treatment of the pool is by Alumina Ferric and Sodium Carbonate. A chlorine content of 1.0 to 1.5 parts per million is maintained during trade, with a pH value of 7.6. Back washing of filters is done by air agitation of sand and washing through to waste by M.W.B. water from a main storage tank. The pool is emptied and refilled as conditions and analysis indicate. Cleaning of the pool sides and bottom is carried out every morning before opening and during the day as circumstances permit. During the year 24 samples of water were taken from the bath and sent for Bacteriological examination and Chemical analysis. Results received from both laboratories showed the water to be satisfactory in every case. RAG DEALERS There are 2 premises in the Borough in which the business of Rag Dealer is carried out. 3 visits of inspection were made. WATER SUPPLY The water supply of the Borough is controlled by the M.W.B. and is relayed from public mains direct to premises. 61. PUBLIC HEALTH PROPAGANDA Health propaganda posters were posted and regularly changed from time to time on the Public Health notice boards which are fixed in positions on the Council's housing estates, in the Town Hall, and Public Libraries. There is also a large notice board situated in St. John's Churchyard. A rack containing leaflets of various type is kept filled, at the entrance to the Department, and in addition to this, Public Health leaflets have been distributed through the courtesy of the Borough Librarian and the Public Libraries, In-so-far as propaganda under the Clean Air Act is concerned, all occupiers and owners of properties have received information letters and booklets. Very wide publicity is being given to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, particularly those affecting Smoke Control Areas. All occupiers in proposed Smoke Control Areas and. the owners of the properties have received relevant literature in this direction. Articles have been written and published in the "Newsletter" published monthly by the Council, but the main propaganda has been by direct verbal transmission in the kitchens of cafes and restaurants, factories and offices, and all types of premises, for it is firmly believed that this type of propaganda really carries a great deal of weight. A great deal of publicity of the work of the Public Health Department has been afforded through the medium of the Television Authorities, in the BBC's overseas programmes, in the National and local Press and in professional journals. ANTI-FLY CAMPAIGN The campaign to combat the fly nuisance has been continued. By arrangement and with the co-operation of the Cleansing & Transport Superintendent, all dust bins and dust chutes are dusted during the fly breeding season with gammexane after the receptacles are emptied by the Council's refuse collectors. A full survey has been made of all refuse container compartments at the foot of dust chutes in local authority flats because of the rapidly changing nature of refuse as the Smoke Control Programme continues. Working in close harmony with the Borough Engineer, work of repair and improvement commenced to bring refuse container compartments up to the standard of the British Code of Practice No. 306 (1960). FREE WASHING FACILITIES Free washing facilities are installed in every public sanitary convenience in the Borough, but these are unfortunately not being used as much as we should like to see. 62.
