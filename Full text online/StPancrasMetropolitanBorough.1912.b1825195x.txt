Being the Report for the Year 1912. I.—INTRODUCTION. The following is the Fifty-Seventh Annual Report upon the Vital and Sanitary Condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last-mentioned date have been great. Changes were made in 1900, at the census of 1901, and again in 1906, when the two southern Sub-Districts were amalgamated. So that now the four Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, except for slight deviations of the outer boundary, coincide with the four Parliamentary Divisions. CENSUS. The following tables give the results of the Census of 1911, and the comparative figures of that of 1901, so far as they are available. 11 Registration District and. Sub-Districts, with their constituent Civil Parish; Area; Houses and Population, 1901 and 1911; and Separate Occupiers, 1911. (The Registration District is co-extensive with the Civil Parish.)

Aggregate number of Marriages, Births and Deaths registered in each Registration District during the intercensal period, 1891—1901; increase or decrease of population compared with difference between Births and Deaths. Note.— The last two columns of this Table show how the increase or decrease of population in each District is the result of the difference between births and deaths and the balance of migration. For comparative purposes the value of the figures in these two columns is, however, seriously affected by the deaths occurring in large hospitals situated in certain Districts.

The Notification of Births Act, 1907, came into operation on 9th March, 1908. Primarily, the duty of notifying a birth to the Medical Officer of Health devolves upon the father of the child if he be resident in the house at the time of the occurrence ; secondarily, upon any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth. The notice must be given by posting a prepaid letter or post card within 36 hours after the birth, or by delivery of a written notice of the birth at the office of the Medical Officer of Health within the same time. The local authority must supply, without charge, addressed and stamped post cards containing the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife residing or practising in their area who applies for the same. The notification is in addition to and not in substitution for the requirements of the Act relating to the registration of births, and it applies to any child born after the expiration of the 28th week of pregnancy, whether alive or dead. Liability to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings is incurred by any person who fails to give notice of a birth unless there is reasonable ground to believe that notice has been duly given by some other person. 29 ACTION TAKEN DURING THE YEAH.

During the year 1912,of 5008 live births registered, 4660, or 93.1 per cent., wore notified within 36 hours, and. in addition, 123 still-births. The sending of cautionary letters in cases where there has been omission to notify is having the effect of bringing the notifications in earlier. The effect upon the infantile mortality has been as follows: In 1904 = 151.6 deaths of infants per 1000births. „ 1905 = 135.7 „ „ „ „ 1906 = 131.1 ,.1907 = 113.8 „ 1908 = 115.0 „ 1909 = 108.8 ,,1910=107 8 „ 1911 = 121.3 (112.1)* „ 1912 = 94.3 (88.0)* The Position of St. Pancras. When it is called to mind what a large proportion of infant mortality is caused by summer diarrhoea and other diseases due to improper feeding in the hot weather, it is apparent that the principal test of the value of a system of saving infant life by breast-feeding is the total mortality in the third, or summer quarter of the year. The prevalence of measles exerts its main effect in the second and fourth quarters, and cold in the presence of poverty, which connotes insufficient clothing and warming in the first or winter quarter of the year, and prematurity, more or less, all the year round.

PANCRAS PREVENTIVE SCHEME. The St. Pancras preventive scheme of infantile mortality is briefly as follows:— 1. Notification of Births.—From these are selected the most suitable cases to visit, commencing with the poorest houses in the poorest streets. 2. Advice Cards to Mothers.— A copy of the Advice Card is sent to the mother of every newly-born child as soon as the birth is notified. Supplies of these cards are also sent to the medical practitioners, hospitals, dispensaries, and midwives for distribution. 3. Medical Advice.—In cases where mothers are suffering from disease they are referred to doctors, hospitals, and dispensaries, and where mothers are in need of extra food and milk to continue breast-feeding they are referred to religious and charitable organisations, and especially the St. Pancras Schools for Mothers. During the year, as previously, the work of the Woman Inspector in advising expectant mothers and in correcting defective and improper feeding has been supplemented by assistance received from a number of lady voluntary visitors. The St. Pancras Mothers' and Infants' Society, supported by voluntary contributions and voluntary workers, with its SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS at No. 1, Ampthill Square, supplements the municipal work, and is doing a great good in the southern part of the Borough. In 1911 a North St. Pancras School for Mothers was started by a Committee of Ladies and Gentlemen, who obtained the use of a large room at 4, Rhyl Street, Maiden Road, Kentish Town. This new School is doing excellent work and increasing rapidly. REPORT OF THE WOMAN INSPECTOR AND HEALTH VISITOR. Report of the work done for the Prevention of Infant Mortality in the Borough of St. Pancras during the year 1912. The work has been done on the same lines as in previous years, though the numbers of infants visited have been somewhat smaller than usual, owing to the diminution of help from qualified voluntary visitors during the past year. This is to be partially accounted for by the increased number of Boroughs which have made use of the services of newly qualified unpaid workers in this way, and partly by the decrease in the number of educated women who are entering the Public Health Service. 34 In June of this year the London County Council scheme for the cleansing of children came into operation at the St. Pancras Cleansing Station. Since that date there has been a large increase in the clerical and visiting work connected with the cleansing of school children. The result has been a considerable curtailing of the infant work. Fortunately, owing to the cold summer, there was no epidemic of infantile diarrhoea, so there was no necessity for a special Infant Mortality Inquiry as in 1911. I have again to record the invaluable help I have had in the co-operation of the two St. Pancras Schools for Mothers, and also from the variousphilanthropic and charitable bodies working in the Borough. These have been of the greatest assistance in dealing with difficult and necessitous cases. The clerical work in connection with the Notification of Births Act has been done on the same lines as in previous years. Advice cards are sent to each mother on the receipt of the Birth Notification. Comparisons are made weekly between the Notified and Registered Births, and cautionary letters sent to those fathers who have failed to comply with the Notification of Births Act. Complete indices are also kept of all births and deaths of infants occurring in the Borough. The subjoined table A shows the proportion of breast-fed, mixed-fed and hand-fed infants in those cases inquired into during the year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum.—Eighteen notifications of this disease have been received. All these were being nursed at home when the first inquiry was made. Three were afterwards admitted to hospital. In four cases Queen's or other district nurses were called in, while 11 mothers were taught how to carry out the doctor's instructions themselves. I have in every case made the inquiry on the day of the receipt of the notification, and have afterwards kept the case under observation, paying 57 re-visits, and arranging for the disinfection of the clothing and bedding on the patient's recovery or removal to hospital. It is satisfactory to note that there has been a diminution in the number of these cases, only 18 having been notified during the entire tvear, as compared with 26 during 9½ months in 1911. It will be seen by the accompanying table that all these notifications were received during the first four weeks of the infant's life, and 13 out of 18 during the first fortnight. The proportion of doctors and midwives attending at these confinements may therefore be of interest, and is set out below :— Doctors' cases 6 Midwives 10 18 Confinements in hospital 2 It may be noted that there has been no case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum notified this year where a Professional Assistant—i.e., a Medical Student attached to one of the Medical Schools situated in or near the Borough—has attended at the confinement. It is necessary to again emphasize the need for more instruction to be given to the untrained nurse or relation who attends the mother and infant in the intervals between the visits of the doctor or midwife. The trouble with the infant's eyes can often be traced to this source. 35 The London County Council arranges courses of instruction for nurses of this kind during the winter months, and it is very desirable that these classes should be more widely known and taken advantage of. Puerperal Fever. —There have been 20 cases of Puerperal Fever notified in St. Pancras during 19102. The proportion of Doctors, Midwives, and Prof' ssional Assistants attending these confinements were as follows :— Doctors' cases 8 Midwives' cases 4 Professional Assistants' cases 7 Confinement in hospital 1 20 Fourteen cases were removed to hospital or infirmary, 12 recovered, 8 died. In every case I made an inquiry on the day of the receipt of the notification, and arranged fur the disinfection of the patient's bed on her removal or recovery. With regard to Puerperal Fever and Ophthalmia Neonatorum cases, we have co-operated with the lady Inspectors of the London County Council with good effect. Although there has been a great reduction in the number of deaths due to Epidemic Diarrhoea, and some reduction in those due to Respiratory Diseases, further work remains to be done. The percentage of deaths due to prematurity and debility is still large, and we are carefully considering this problem as occasion permits, in order to suggest any further possible action for the prevention of mortality from these causes.

Scorch.—An epoc-marking impetus has been given of recent years to personal hygiene and preventive medicine by the method of search. In inquiring into any infectious disease it is ascertained whether there are any other persons in the house unwell, and, if so, they are advised to seek medical advice forthwith. In cases of consumption the health-visitor or nurse searches out contacts, suspects, and susceptible persons and sends them to be medically examined as to their condition and to have their symptoms or disease diagnosed. A systematic search is now made amongst school children for any defects or diseases present, and the search being conducted by medical practitioners the examination and diagnosis are made at the same time. Bacteriological Tests.—When cases of suspected infectious diseases occur there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examinations are broutrht to bear noon doubtful tvnes. and to check or confirm the diagnosis. The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid, or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows :— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 127 .. 190 317 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 15 .. 10 25 Bacillus Found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 37 .. 109 146 39 Swabs of the secretion of the throat or nose are taken in three sets of circumstances for bacteriological examination— 1. In order to verify the diagnosis of diphtheria at the earliest moment. 2. In order to ascertain that a patient is free from diphtheria bacilli before release from isolation. 3. In order to obtain information whether apparently healthy contacts are harbouring diphtheria bacilli in the throat or nose.

They were advised that erysipelas had not for some time past been regarded by the medical profession as a disease which was liable to spread by contagion or infection, and that, although in their Borough disinfection was carried out, yet in certain Metropolitan Boroughs this practice had been abandoned ; also that if notification were discontinued, there would be, obviously, a saving to the rates of the notification fees and other expenses. Your Council were not in agreement with the opinion of the Stepney Council as they believed the notification of erysipelas in the past has had a very beneficial effect in lessening the disease and its fatality. The average number of cases of this disease notified in St. Pancras during the past ten years has been 201 per annum, and the deaths have averaged 11 per annum. Notification is considered valuable, as it results in an inspection of the premises with the possibility of the service of notices for the abatement of nuisances, and the cleansing and disinfection of bedding, &c. Dirt, effluvia, and overcrowding are predisposing causes of this as well as other diseases, and in the absence of notification proper steps could not be tak n by the Sanitary Authority to remove as far as possible these causes of the disease. For these reasons the Stepney Borough Council and the Local Government Board were informed that this Authority did not favour steps being taken to remove erysipelas from the list of notifiable diseases. This matter was considered by the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in 1906, and it was decided that it was undesirable to take any steps to remove erysipelas from the list of notifiable diseases. DIPHTHERIA. An outbreak of Diphtheria occurred atthe Foundling Hospital, Guilford Street, W.C. The last serious epidemic which was an outbreak of Typhoid occurred in 1891. Previous to that period there used to be outbreaks of various kinds of diseases once or twice a year. Subsequent to that period there has been no serious outbreak until the present. This may reasonably be attributed to the fact that formerly the infirmary was on the top floor of the west wing of the building, and after the Typhoid outbreak the Governors were advised to build a separate infirmary. With this infirmary the procedure is to examine the children in the wards or classes, and if any abnormality of health presents itself to send such as are affected to the Infirmary. If in the Infirmary a definite disease of an infectious or notifiable nature develops, the children are promptly sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, so that for notifiable infectious diseases the hospital infirmary acts as a quarantine station and provides a duplicate stage of protection. 46 The present epidemic of Diphtheria commenced with a single ease on the 17th August. On the 25th August, two further cases occurred, and so at intervals of one or two days cases continued to occur until the 8th September ; then there were intervals of six days, four days, two days, and one day, and the last three cases occurred on the 21st September. The total number of cases was 54, of which only 4 were girls, all the rest being boys, the disease evidently spreading by personal infection from certain boys in ward 1, thence to wards 2, 3, and 4. the cases being more numerous in the two former wards, and less numerous in the two latter wards, towards the end of the epidemic. Of the 54 cases, in no less than 38, the diphtheria bacillus was found but there were no patches in the throat; in 10 cases the diphtheria bacillus was found in conjunction with patches in the throat; and in 6 eases there were patches of membrane in the throat, but no bacteriological examination was made before removal of the patient to hospital. There seems little doubt that the prompt removal of diphtheria bacilli carriers to the Asylums Hoard Hospital, and disinfection carried out by the Foundling Hospital Authorities after each case, put an end to the epidemic. In addition to the resident officers and the household servants, there are about 350 inmates in the institution, of whom about one half are boys and one half girls. In the course of examining the drainage, it was found that certain openings into the drain for surface water had been enclosed, or built in, or surrounded by building, and the architect and surveyor to the estate was advised that these openings should be placed outside the building, and the surface drainage has been diverted for this purpose. In any case, the specific diphtheria bacillus is not conveyed by sewer gas or drain air. There is no reason to think that the condition of the drainage was the cause of the outbreak, since the weather of August was cold, wet, and gloomy enough to lower the vitality of the children and to produce relaxed throats. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. Extract from Rules and Regulations in regard to Infectious Diseases affecting children attending the Council's Public Elementary, Day Special, and Day Industrial Schools. Adopted 12th July, 1910, and 7th May, 1912. Diphtheria. Rules for Guidance Immediately diphtheria appears in a school great attention should be directed to all children who are suffering from sore throat or sore nose, especially those in the same class in which the patient sat, and those who are likely to have been in any way associated with the patient. Special instructions to exclude all children suffering from these symptoms will be sent to the school by the school medical officer when diphtheria threatens in any class, together with a supply of cards (M.O. 35) to be distributed to the children so excluded. Children examined by the school doctor and found to be harbouring diphtheria bacilli will also be excluded. Any child excluded under any of the above circumstances must not be allowed to return to school within four weeks unless a medical certificate has been produced to the effect that a culture has been taken and that no diphtheria bacilli have been found. Forms M.O. 95 are supplied for this 47 purpose. Particulars in regard to all children so excluded must be reported on form 84. 111 the event of the required medical certificate not being submitted within four weeks head teachers are to communicate with the school medical officer for instructions as to re-admission of the children. PROPOSED COMPULSORY NOTIFICATION OF LEPROSY. On the 28th February, 1912, the Council informed the Local Government Hoard that they were of opinion that leprosy should be made a notifiable disease for the purpose of controlling the movements and habits of the patients, but that before passing the necessary resolution to effect this, as they are empowered to do by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Council would be glad to receive the views of the Board on the subject. A communication, in reply, was received from the Board, stating that they had the matter under consideration, but would be glad to be informed what action the Council contemplate should be taken in the event of cases of leprosy being made compulsorily notifiable. On the 12th June, 1912, the Local Government Board were informed that the action the Council contemplate should be taken in the event of cases of leprosy being made notifiable by Local Government Board Order is as follows :— 1.—To localise and ascertain history of cases. 2.—To observe whether number is increasing or decreasing. 3.—To ascertain whether a case is of (a) close or (b) open type. (ia) If of close type no special precautions would be necsssary. (b) If of open type, to obtain medical opinion as to any precautions to be taken in the home, and if the patient be seriously ill to provide proper segregation and nursing. 4. — Not to put any enactment into force which imposes a penalty or restricts the occupation of a patient. I11 reply to n question in the House of Commons on the 20tli March, 1913, the President of the Local Government Board stated—"There are only a few cases of leprosy in this country, and so far as I am aware, the disease is not spreading here. I am advised that measures for the compulsory segregation of persons suffering from leprosy in this country would not be justified at present. I may add that the whole question is under the careful consideration of my Department." 48 CONSUMPTION (PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS*. Deaths from Consumption.

Report of the Chief Clerk upon the Administrative Measures in St. Pancras in relation to Tuberculosis. It is desirable in the first instance to indicate the course of events relating to this subject from the time of the passing of the National Insurance Act, 1911. The National Insurance Act, 1911—Section 8 (1) provides that: — " Subject to the provisions of this Act, the benefits conferred by this part of this Act upon insured persons are * * * (b) Treatment in sanatoria or other institutions or otherwise when suffering from tuberculosis, or such other diseases as the Local Government Board, with the approval of the Treasury may appoint (in this Act called ' sanatorium benefit'.)" Section 16 (1) provides that:— "For the purpose of administering sanatorium benefit, Insurance Committees shall make arrangements, to the satisfaction of the Insurance Commissioners—(ff) With a view to providing treatment for insured persons suffering from tuberculosis or any other such disease as aforesaid in sanatoria and other institutions, with persons or local authorities (other than poor law authorities) having the management of sanatoria or other institutions approved by the Local Government Board, which treatment it shall be lawful for a local authority to provide as respects insured persons resident outside as well as respects those resident within their area; and (h) With a view to providing treatment for such persons otherwise than in sanatoria or other 51 institutions, with persons and local authorities (other than poor law authorities) undertaking such treatment in a manner approved by the Local Government Board, which treatment (including the appointment of officers for the purpose) it shall be lawful for a local authority, if so authorised by the Local Government Board, to undertake." Section 16 (2) specifies the sums payable out of the insurance fund and out of moneys provided by Parliament for the purpose of defraying the expenses of sanatorium benefit. Section 17 provides that if the Insurance Committee thinks fit, similar treatment may be extended to the dependants of insured persons, or to any class of such dependants. If the amount available for defraying the expenses of sanatorium benefit is insufficient to provide for the treatment of insured persons and such dependants, the deficit may, with the sanction of the Treasury and of the Local Authority, be made up in equal shares out of moneys provided by Parliament and out of the rates. Under section 64 (4) an Insurance Committee, with the consent of the Insurance Commissioners, may enter into agreements with any person or authority (other than a poor law authority), that, in consideration of the provision of treatment in a sanatorium or other institution or otherwise for persons recommended by the Committee for sanatorium benefit, the Committee will make annual or other payments, subject to such conditions and for such period as may be agreed, towards the maintenance of the institution or provision of treatment. Under section 64 (1) of the Act, and section 16 (1) (b) of the Finance Act, 1911, a capital sum of £1,000.000 is available " for the purposes of the provision of or making grants in aid to sanatoria and other institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis or such other diseases as the Local Government Hoard with the approval of the Treasury may appoint," which grants shall be distributed by the Local Government Board with the consent of the Treasury after the latter has consulted the Insurance Commissioners. The sum mentioned is to be apportioned between England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, in proportion to the respective populations as ascertained by the census of 1911. If any such grant is made to a County Council, the Local Government Board may authorise the County Council to provide, manage and maintain sanatoria and other institutions, and any expenses incurred, so far as not defrayed out of the grant, will be defrayed out of the county fund. Report of Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis—In April, 1912, a Departmental Committee which had been appointed " to report at an early date upon the consideration of general policy in respect of the problem of tuberculosis in the United Kingdom in its preventive, curative and other aspects, which should guide the Government and local bodies in making or aiding provision for the •treatment of tuberculosis in sanatoria or other institutions or otherwise," issued an interim report in view of the coming into force of the National Insurance Act, 1911. They recommended that for the prevention, detection and treatment •of the disease, existing public health administration should be supplemented by 52 the establishment and equipment of two units linked up to the general public health and medical work carried oil by the Medical Officers of Health (1) the tuberculosis dispensary, and (2) sanatoria, hospitals, etc. The principal recommendations of the Departmental Committee are to the following effect:— " That with a view to encouraging the early provision and equipment of* tuberculosis dispensaries, capital grants should be made up to fourfifths of the amount required, provided that this sum should generally not exceed £ 1 per 750 population, or an average of £240 per dispensary." " That for the provision of the additional sanatorium beds for adults required at the outset, capital grants should be made up to three-fifths of the cost per bed, provided that the total sum does not exceed an average of £90 per bed." ' That grants should be made for beds other than sanatorium beds." "That schemes dealing with the whole population should be drawn up by the councils of counties and county boroughs, or by combinations of these bodies, at the earliest possible date, on the lines recommended in the report, with due regard to the incidence of the disease and the special conditions and circumstances of the area." " That the early establishment in working order of an adequate number of tuberculosis dispensaries is essential." "Thatso far as possible grants in aid of tuberculosis dispensaries should only be given when such institutions will eventually form constituent parts of complete schemes." " That, in framing complete schemes, regard should be had to all the existing available authorities, organisations and institutions with a view to avoiding waste bv overlapping, and to obtaining their cooperation and inclusion within the schemes proposed." " That special regard should be given to securing the co-operation of medical practitioners in the schemes, particularly in the relation to the early detection of the disease and its domiciliary and dispensary treatment." " That special attention shoidd be paid to securing suitably qualified and experienced medical practitioners for the senior appointments iu connection with institutions established, as the ultimate result obtained by the treatment recommended must depend to a great extent iq)on their medical and administrative qualifications." " That in erecting or adapting institutions, local authorities and other bodies should avoid pretentious and extravagant buildings, and should aim rather at providing institutions of a simple and inexpensive character." 53 "That, as regards London, it should be considered whether some of the sanatoria and hospitals required should not be provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and whether dispensaries should not be provided by the metropolitan borough councils." Action taken by the Government—The Local Government Board in a circular letter, dated 14th May, 191 2, called attention to the report of the Departmental Committee, and stated that they agreed generally with the findings of the Committee, including the financial recommendations in regard to the distribution of the capital grant. The Board suggested that the council of each county and county borough should forthwith take the matter into serious consideration, and by conference and consultation with the other councils, determine what action they should take. As a first step in formulating a scheme, the Board suggested that the Medical Officer of Health should be asked to submit a report setting; out the existing means for the treatment of tuberculosis within the county or county borough, whether in the hands of local authorities or otherwise, and his estimate of the needs of the area generally. It was followed by a further circular letter, dated 6th July, 1912, addressed to county councils, and county borough councils, dealing with provisional arrangements for the treatment of insured persons recommended for sanatorium benefit, and urging that complete schemes relating to the whole population, and not only to insured persons, should be prepared in conference with the insurance committees and sanitary authorities, the unit area for such schemes to be generally the county or county borough. On the 27th July, 1912, a further letter was sent by the Board to county councils, sanitary authorities and insurance committees in England and Wales relative to the domiciliary treatment of insured tuberculous persons and •enclosing copy of an Order under Section 10 (1) [b) of the National Insurance Act. In this letter the Board observe that when the provision for combating this disease which has been recommended by the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis is complete, a dispensary with an expert consulting officer will be available in every area as part of the general public health organisation. The Order provides that the consulting officer of a dispensary approved by the Board shall be the consulting officer for the purpose of the regulations, and that until such officer has been appointed, the Medical Officer of Health of the county or county borough shall act in that capacity, outside London, and in the Metropolis, the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority. Article If. of the Order provides that the treatment shall be carried out under the care and direction of a Medical Practitioner subject to the following conditions, and to such other conditions as the Board from time to time approve, that is to say :— (1) That the Medical Practitioner attend each patient at such intervals as may be necessary in the interest of the patient. (2) That the Medical Practitioner give the patient such instructions as are required as to his mode of living, diet, rest and work, and as to precautions necessary to protect the patient against re-infection. 54 (3) That the Medical Practitioner keep on a card or sheet, in the form set out in the Schedule, a continuous record of the clinical history of the illness of each patient and particulars of the treatment given, to the patient under his direction. (4) That the Medical Practitioner submit the said card or sheet to the- Consulting Officer at such times as may be arranged between them. (5) That the Medical Practitioner prepare and transmit to the Consulting Officer at such times as may be arranged between them, not being less often than once in three months, a report in regard to each, patient, giving particulars as to :- (a) the progress of the patient; (b) whether the conditions under which the patient is living and receiving the treatment are satisfactory ; (c) the behaviour of the patient in carrying out instructions given to him; and (ri) whether in the opinion of the Medical Practitioner any form of institutional treatment has become desirable. (6) That the Medical Practitioner confer with the Consulting Officer at such times and in such circumstances as may be arranged between them in regard to patients under the care of the Medical Practitioner. (7) That the Medical Practitioner from time to time inform the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary District in which the patient resides of any circumstances known to the Medical Practitioner which may affect adversely the sanitary conditions under which the patient is living, and in respect to which action by the Medical Officer of Health or of the Sanitary Authority would, in the opinion of the Medical Practitioner, be necessary or desirable. On the 6th December, 1912, a further circular letter was issued by the Local Government Board with reference to schemes for institutional treatment of tuberculosis. A copy of a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to Mr. Henry Hobhouse, on the subject of the representations made on behalf of the County Council's Association in regard to the financial arrangements, was appended. Under "Preventive Measures" it states that the "The Board wish to emphasise the fact that it is the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of the sanitary district, upon the receipt of a notification under the tuberculosis regulations, either himself or through an officer acting under his instructions, to make such enquiries and take such steps as may appear to him necessary or desirable for preventing the spread of infection and for removing conditions favourable to infection. These enquiries will necessarily include investigation into sources of infection, search for contacts, and inquiry into housing conditions." 55 Under "Finance" and in regard to maintenance grants it states that the National Insurance Act requires Insurance Committees to make arrangements for insured persons to receive treatment, and empowers them to extend their arrangements so as to include also the dependants, or any class of dependants, of insured persons. The Act also provides that any estimated excess of expenditure over income may be met as to half by the Local Authority and as to the other half from the Exchequer in cases where the expenditure has been sanctioned by the Local Authority and the Treasury. It has now been decided that the Exchequer will definitely pay half of the deficiency in all cases where the Local Authority has accepted the like responsibility. It has, however, been represented that it would be a great advantage in the interests of the community as a whole, if schemes could be undertaken which would cover not only insured persons, and their dependants, (who together form the great bulk of the population), but also those who fall within neither category. The Government are willing, therefore, that in this case, also, the Exchequer should, under the conditions described below, bear half of any deficiency. The intention is that the amount of the annual grant should be one-half of the total net cost incurred within reasonable limits, after deducting the amounts received from the Insurance Committees out of the moneys available under the Act for sanatorium benefit, and any sums received in respect of the treatment of non-insured persons or otherwise. The National Insurance Act requires that Insurance Committees should be primarily responsible for seeing that insured persons, and any class of the dependants of insured persons to whom they have extended sanatorium benefit, receive the appropriate treatment, and this responsibility necessarily remains under the system now proposed. Subject, however, to this responsibility, it is competent to the Insurance Committees to enter into arrangements with the Local Authorities for providing institutional treatment and to pay over the sums available under the Act for the purposes of such treatment. The Council, on the 5th February, 1013, informed the London County Council that the grant for the maintenance of the St. Pancras Tuberculosis Dispensary should be allotted to the Council direct. Sanatorium Benefit.—By the Insurance Act provision is made to give what is known as sanatorium benefit to insured persons suffering from tuberculosis (not pulmonary tuberculosis alone), but these persons are not entitled to such benefit unless the Insurance Committee recommends the case (Section l(J (3) ). Dependants of insured persons may also receive this benefit if the Insurance Committee think pioper (Section 17 (1) ). It is not necessarily treatment in a sanatorium. It may be given in one of the following forms :—(a) At home (domiciliary treatment); (A) At a dispensary; (c) As an out-patient of a hospital ; (d) In a hospital ; (e) In a sanatorium. The Insurance Committee itself has no power to provide the treatment, it can only make arrangements with other bodies or persons to give it. There is no legal obligation on local authorities to build sanatoria or dispensaries, but in order to obtain a share of the capital sum of a million and a half provided by the Finance Act, 1911, local authorities have to satisfy the Local Government Board as to the suitability of their schemes. Apart from the above mentioned sum, the Insurance Act (Section 16 (2) ) provides a sum of Is. 3d. per insured person for defraying the expenses of sanatorium benefit, but since January last, in 56 accordance with an arrangement made by the Treasury, this amount has been depleted to the extent of 6d. per head, which has been allocated to the panel doctors. In London this represents a sum of about £36,000 per annum. One penny per head has also been earmarked for administration expenses, leaving only 8d. per head out of the original Is. 3d. provided by the Act. According to the Press, the London Insurance Committee report that the amount remaining is inadequate for dispensary and out-patient hospital treatment, the provisions of drugs and accessories, and administration expenses, and that the Committee had made representations to the Treasury on this inadequacy. The Treasury replied regretting that they saw no prospect of making arrangements whereby domiciliary treatment of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis could be provided for out of funds other than those appropriated under the National Insurance Act, 1911, for the purposes of sanatorium benefit, and that, pending the putting into operation of the provisions of Section 17 of the Act or the adoption of a general scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis on the,lines proposed in the recent Local Government Board circular.it will be necessary that the expenditure of the Insurance Committee in respect of all forms of treatment, including domiciliary, should be kept within the amount available under sub-section (2) of Section 16. It has been previously pointed out that under Section 17 the Treasury and the Local Authority may, if they think fit, meet the deficiency in equal shares. Domiciliary Treatment—Reference has already been made to the < >rder of the Local Government Board with regard to the domiciliary treatment of insured tuberculous persons. The following important communication, dated the 28th September, 1912, was addressed to the Acting Clerk of the London Insurance Committee by the National Health Insurance Commission (England): — " In reply to your letter of the 17th instant, relating to the temporary scheme of your Committee for the administration of sanatorium benefit, I am directed by the National Health Insurance Commission (England) to point out that their letter of the 16th ultimo had reference to the supply of medicines and accessories of treatment for insured persons recommended for sanatorium benefit. Under Section 16 of the National Insurance Act an Insurance Committee is required to make arrangements with persons or local authorities (other than poor law authorities) undertaking the treatment of tuberculosis, with a view to providing treatment for insured persons suffering from tuberculosis, and in such cases the medicines, etc., must be supplied by the persons or local authorities undertaking the treatment. Section 15 (5) of the Act to which you call attention deals solely with the administration of medical benefit. In reply to your second enquiry I am to state that your Committee are not themselves empowered to supply any beds, special forms of food, and other accessories of treatment direct, but that arrangements may be made for the provision of any such accessories as may be ordered for the patient in the course of the treatment by the persons or local authorities undertaking the treatment." 57 On the l5th January, 1918, a further letter on the same subject was received from the Clerk of the London Insurance Committee: — " With reference to previous correspondence on the question of supplying food to insured persons, I am directed to draw your attention to the National Health Insurance Commissioners' letter of the 28th September, 1912 (a copy of which was sent to you) from which you will note that the Committee themselves have 110 power to supply beds, special forms of food and other accessories of treatment direct to persons receiving sanatorium benefit under the provisions of the National Insurance Act. The Committee are, however, now advised that they may make arrangements for the supply to insured persons receiving home treatment as their patients of such special food or extra nourishment as may be recommended as part of that treatment by the medical practitioner attending the case. In these circumstances they propose for the present to accept liability for reasonable expenditure incurred by medical practitioners who have already undertaken domiciliary treatment of their patients in ordering articles forming part of, or which are strictly ancillary to that treatment. It must, however, be carefully borne in mind that 110 account for unreasonable expenditure will be passed and that the Committee have no power toarrange for the provision of ordinary food, etc., to necessitous insured persons who are in an impecunious position. The Poor Law Authority is charged with that power." It will be remembered that there was 110 waiting period provided for sanatorium benefit ; it took effect from the commencement of the Act, namely the 15th July, 1912. From this date it was the practice of the London Insurance Committee, in those cases which were recommended for domiciliary treatment, to communicate with the Medical Officer of Health asking him to arrange for such treatment, the result of which was to co-ordinate home treatment with the Public Health Department, but since the middle of January, 1913, when the panel system came into operation, the Public Health Department receives no information from the Insurance Committee of the cases which are being treated at home, the patients being referred direct to their panel doctors. Local Control—Each applicant for sanatorium benefit is required to fill up a form and to be examined by his panel doctor. In cases where the applicant is an inmate of an institution, the form may be signed by the Medical Superintendent of the institution concerned. The following note appears on the form: — " No person is entitled to receive sanatorium benefit unless recommended by the Insurance Committee. The Committee are not prepared to accept liability for the maintenance of insured persons who enter institutions without the previous sanction of the Committee. A person applying for sanatorium benefit must produce his or her contribution card and insurance book and such other evidence as may be required by the Insurance Committee. Sanatorium benefit may, at the discretion of the Committee, take the form of treatment in a sanatorium, hospital, dispensary or the patient's home." 58 The form is then sent to the Insurance Committee and subsequently the patient is examined by the Committee's expert medical adviser who recommends the kind of treatment that should be given. The attention of your Committee was directed to the unsatisfactory manner in which certain cases of insured persons in St. Pancras suffering from tuberculosis have been dealt with by the London Insurance Committee. Your Committee felt that the delays and failures result from the fact that central control is insisted upon, and no local discretionary powers allowed, and were of opinion that the District Committees should have granted to them adequate authority to arrange for the treatment of all cases residing in their districts in order to avoid the delay of sending the applications to the Central Committee and waiting for decisions to be arrived at. It is obvious that better results will be obtained if the District Committees are allowed to deal at first hand with local cases, as by enquiries and visitation, if necessary, thev will be aware of the actual circumstances and needs thereof. The clear intention of the Act was to dissociate insured persons from the Poor Law, but owing to the delay in obtaining institutional treatment several St. Pancras cases have availed themselves of the Infirmary. It was the opinion of your Committee that the applications for sanatorium benefit should be made to the District Insurance Committee and the patients •examined by the Tuberculosis Officer at the Dispensary, and then, if necessary, those patients recommended for treatment in a sanatorium could be seen by the medical referee of the Central Committee. "With a view to obtaining this result the Council, on the 19th March, 1913, passed the following resolution:— " That representations be made to the Insurance Commissioners and the London Insurance Committee urging that powers be given to the District Committees to arrange for the treatment of all cases of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis who are resident in their districts." On the 1st April, 1913, a reply was received from the London Insurance Committee stating that they do not at present see their way to agree that powers should be delegated to the District Insurance Committees as proposed. Action taken by the Borough Council—St. Pancran Dispensary.—An application was made to your Committee on behalf of the St. Pancras Dispensary asking the Borough Council to apply to the Local Government Board for their approval of the tuberculosis department of the dispensary as an institution to serve the needs of the Borough under the National Insurance Act, 1911, and to make a grant in aid thereof. A deputation attended before your Committee on the 19th June, 1912, for the purpose of supporting the application and explained the position of the institution and the scheme at present working and being further developed. The St. Pancras Dispensary was established in 1810 as the "St. Pancras an<l Northern Dispensary," and has been at work in the Borough ever since that date—102 years since. It has some half-dozen departments, and amongst them a general medical department, in which during the past four years all the contacts, suspects, and persons suspected of tuberculosis sent by the Borough Council have been examined, diagnosed, and reported upon, with the approval of 59 the Governors. This tuberculosis dispensary or department has grown to sufficient importance to separate it from the general medical department and to be constituted a department of its own, and an expert diagnostician (a specialist in tuberculosis) has been appointed head of the department. This has necessitated the dispensary removing from 126, Euston Road, n.w., to 39, Oakley Square, N.W., where the premises are much larger and more convenient. They are admirably suited and centrally situated for the purpose of a tuberculosis dispensary or department for the Borough. The new department is being fitted with the latest and most scientific appliances for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the premises are being altered, adapted, repaired, and decorated at considerable expense. The expense of developing this tuberculosis dispensary or department has practically exhausted the funds of the general dispensary. The capital expenditure incurred, and to be incurred is approximately £1,000, and the annual maintenance will probably amount to not very much less, a considerable portion of which will have to be specially allocated to the tuberculosis dispensary or department of the institution. The deputation also urged that a great deal of trouble and expense would be saved in adapting and adopting the existing institution, which has been doing the work for the last four years, .than in establishing a new and rival institution. A. The St. Pancras Dispensary consists of the following Departments :— General Medical. General Surgical. Maternity. Diseases of Women and Children. Diseases of the Throat, Nose & Ear. Diseases of the Eye. Dentistry and Diseases of the Teeth. Tuberculosis and Diseases of the Chest. (1) The Tuberculosis Department is managed by a special Committee of Management, which will be re-organised, and upon which will sit representatives of the Dispensary, the Borough Council, the General Practitioners of the Borough, and local cognate institutions, the proportions to be approved by the Local Government Board. (2) The Officers of the Tuberculosis Department will consist of the Tuberculosis Officer, who will conduct the consultations, the Resident Medical Officer (who will act as assistant to the Tuberculosis Officer and under his instructions when necessary during part of the time), the Chemical, Pathological and Clerical Assistant (who will also keep the records of the Department and copies of the Medical Practitioners' Reports), the Nurse (whose whole time will be devoted to the patients), and the Housekeeper (part of whose time will be given to the care of the part of the house occupied by the staff of the Tuberculosis Department). The proportions of the salaries of these various officers to be approved by the Local Government Board. 60 (3) The portions of the premises at 39, Oakley Square to be occupied and used wholly or partly by the Tuberculosis Department will be:— wholly the first floor, consisting of waiting room, consulting room, dressing room, and laboratory. partly the rest of the building. (4) The funds of the Tuberculosis Department, both capital and maintenance, will be kept separate and distinct from the general fund of the Dispensary, and will be under the control of the Special Committee of Management. B. The organisation of the Borough Scheme is as follows :— (1) Search, (2) Examination and Diagnosis, (3) Notification, (4) Treatment, (a) Domiciliary, at home or at surgery, (b) Dispensary, (r) Institutional, sanatorium, hospital, or incuratorium. (1) The search will be made in this manner. The contacts, suspects, and susceptible persons will be sent or brought by medical practitioners, midwives, nurses, health visitors, sanitary inspectors and others to the St. Pancras Dispensary. (2) A thorough examination of each patient sent to the Dispensary will be made by the Tuberculosis Officer, who will record his diagnosis and when necessary will refer the patient to a medical practitioner on the Roll for notification and treatment. (N.B. Copies of the Roll of all medical men and women practising in the Borough are displayed on the walls of the Dispensary). (3) The treatment at home will be conducted by the medical practitioner chosen by the patient; if treatment in an institution be required this will be provided on the certificate of the medical attendant and Tuberculosis Officer. (N.B. The stabling attached to No. 39, Oakley Square forms part of the premises under the lease; it is at present sub-let, but could be re-occupied at short notice and the Dispensary extended over the site of the stables when desired.) Your Committee, after questioning the members of the deputation on many points, were satisfied that the Tuberculosis Dispensary was being conducted in such a manner as to meet the needs of the Borough, and on the 24th July, 1912, the Council decided to apply to the Local Government Board for a capital grant for the extension and equipment of the Institution. The subsequent correspondence is so important that it is reproduced in full. On the 25th October, 1912, the Board replied as follows: — " The Board have received a report made by their Inspector, Dr. Coutts, after a visit paid by him to the Institution on the 30th August 61 last, and it appears to them that the proposed arrangements for staffing the dispensary need further consideration. As at present advised, they are disposed to consider that, in addition to a part-time Consulting Officer, a Medical Officer will be required who possesses special qualifications for the treatment of tuberculosis, and who will give the whole of his time to the work of the tuberculosis dispensary. The Board also wish to be informed whether the time given by the Consulting Officer to the work of the tuberculosis dispensary will be sufficient to admit of his examining all persons who attend at the dispensary. I am further to state that in the Board's view the tuberculosis dispensary should be a centre for treatment as well as diagnosis, and they would wish to receive an assurance that provision will be made at the dispensary for the treatment of all cases which can properly be treated at that institution. I am also to state that before further considering the question of making a grant the Board would require to be satisfied (1) that suitable arrangements have been made for co-ordinating the work of the tuberculosis dispensary with the preventive work of the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough and (2) that the Borough Council will be adequately represented on the Committee of Management, the Medical Officer of Health being a member. I am to add that as a condition of making a capital grant towards the cost of the tuberculosis dispensary the Board would require the authorities of the dispensary and the Borough Council to enter into an agreement providing that the tuberculosis dispensary should be handed over to the Borough Council and maintained by them to the satisfaction of the Board in the event of the authorities of the dispensary failing to do so. As regards the estimated cost of the dispensary, shown in the statement enclosed with Dr. Sykes' letter of the 27th ult., the Board desire to be informed on what ground it is considered equitable to charge to the tuberculosis dispensary two-thirds of the total cost, and, in the case of the X ray apparatus and the laboratory fittings, the whole cost. The Board gather from a comparison of the statements as to capital cost and to cost of maintenance that the lease of the premises has been purchased for £750 out of borrowed moneys, provision being included in the maintenance estimate for the repayment of this sum in apparently 30 years, and if such is the case they would be glad to be informed why a capital grant is required towards the cost of acquiring the lease. In this connection I am to draw attention to the Financial recommendations on page 27 of the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis, and especially to paragraph 1 under "Capital" as to the amount of capital grants available for dispensaries." The following reply was directed to be sent by the Council on the 18th December, 1912:-— " The Council is informed that the St. Pancras Dispensary offer the following replies for the purpose of complying with the requirements of your Board, as expressed in your letter of the 25th October last. 62 The Consulting Physician (a specialist in tuberculosis of years' experience), as at present arranged, will attend at the dispensary to examine patients suffering from tuberculosis who may present themselves, and any suspects, contacts, or susceptible persons who may be sent to him. If necessary the consultations can be extended or increased. The Resident Medical (Officer will be a whole time officer. Theexisting Resident Medical Officer in addition to his University qualifications is acquainted with the methods of Dr. Philip's Dispensary at Edinburgh, had charge of the consumptive patients when resident at the Nottingham General Hospital, has taken the Special Tuberculin course at the Brompton Hospital, and also the Special Post Graduate course in Tuberculosis at the same Hospital, for the last nine months he has seen all the consumptive cases sent to the St. Pancras Dispensary, and is now assisting the physician in the preparation and use of tuberculin. The Tuberculosis Dispensary will be a centre and clearing house for the diagnosis and treatment of all cases of tuberculosis. The records of domicilary treatment by general practitioners will be kept there in accordance with the Order of the Board, and provision will be made for the treatment at the Dispensary of cases which can be properly treated there. With regard to co-ordinating the management and work of the Tuberculosis Dispensary (1) The Tuberculosis Dispensary will continue to pursue the practice followed during the last four years of medically examining all suspects, contacts, and susceptible persons sent to the Institution by medical practitioners or by the Medical Officer of Health, and to report upon such persons as to whether they are suffering from tuberculosis or from any other of the various causes of similar early symptoms. The records of the Institution will be at all times open to the inspection of the Medical Officer of Health, and such written information as he may require he will be furnished with. It is now proposed with the approval of the Board to constitute the Committee of Management in the following number and proportions, namely, the Committee to consist of 18 members, one-third representative of the original St. Pancras Dispensary, one-third representative of the Borough Council, one-sixth representative of the local medical practitioners, and one sixth representative of local cognate institutions, that is, the Ranyard Nurses, St Pancras Public Welfare Association, St. Pancras School for Mothers, and in addition the Medical Officer of Health and Woman Inspector ex-officio. With regard to the finance of the Institution, the original St. Pancras Dispensary is prepared to enter into an agreement with the Borough Council that the Tuberculosis Department should be handed over to the Borough Council and maintained by them to the satisfaction of the Board in the event of the Committee of Management failing to maintain the Tuberculosis Department to the satisfaction of the Board, provided that the Local Government Board and the liorough Council re-imburse the original St. Pancras Dispensary for the proportion of capital expenditure disbursed by the original St. Pancras Dispensary for the establishment and equipment of the Tuberculosis Department. The Capital Expenditure- 63 apparently amounts to £468 13s. 4d., and it is expected that four-fifths of this will be re-imbursed by the Local Government Board. As regards the estimated cost of the Dispensary, shown in the statement enclosed with Dr. Sykes' letter of the 27th September last, the grounds on which it is considered equitable to charge the Tuberculosis Dispensary with two-thirds of the total cost are that the expenses of the new premises and the equipment have been incurred specially for the purpose of providing the Tuberculosis Department with an up-to-date establishment and organisation which were not necessary for the original Dispensary, and because it was thought that the Board would not be satisfied with anything less complete or efficient. It was not contemplated originally that the X ray apparatus and the laboratory fittings should be used for any other purposes than for tuberculosis, but with the approval of the Board, if so used they could also be apportioned as to two thirds of the cost instead of the whole cost. For the simplification and uniformity of the Capital Amount, the whole amount apportioned to the Tuberculosis Department might then be reduced to two-thirds, so that the total proportion would then stand at £1,218 13s. 4d. In the Maintenance Account the cost of an "Annual Sinking Fund " has been so entered in error, and should have been entered in the form of " Rental," as the lease was not purchased with borrowed money, but with cash derived from the sale of securities, and if it is to remain entirely the property of the original St. Pancras Dispensary the sum of £750 should be deducted from the original capital expenditure of £1218 13s. 4d. and it would then stand at £468 13s. 4d. The last sentence of the Board's letter refers to the Financial recommendations in the penultimate group of paragraphs of the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee oil Tuberculosis. There, under the head of Capital the first paragraph recommends that Capital grants should be made up to four-fifths of the amount required. With a view toarriving at a practical adjustment of the Capital Expenditure it appears that if the Board would indicate the amount that they would be prepared to contribute, the Committee of the St. Pancras Dispensary could ascertain what amount would still be available for Capital Expenditure, as the original St. Pancras Dispensary is coming to the end of its resources and incurring debts beyond them in order to finance the Tuberculosis Dispensary, facilitate the working of the National Insurance Act, and assist the Local Government Board and the Borough Council in providing for sufferers from Tuberculosis. I am to add, on behalf of the Council, and in reply to the fifth paragraph of your letter of the 25th October last, that the Borough Council is prepared to enter into an agreement with the authorities of the dispensary that the tuberculosis dispensary should be handed over to the Borough Council and maintained by them to the satisfaction of the Board in the event of the authorities of the dispensary failing to do so provided that satisfactory terms and conditions can be arranged." 64 The Local Government Board replied to the following effect on the '28th January, 1913 : — " As regards the medical staff of the dispensary I am to state that the Board are willing to accept the proposals contained in your letter on the understanding that if at any time the Board are advised that the staff proposed is not adequate to discharge satisfactorily the work of the tuberculosis dispensary, such alterations or additions will be made as may be necessary. With regard to the management of the dispensary I am to state that the Board assent to the proposal that the Borough Council of St. Pancras should appoint one-third of the Committee of Management, with the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough an ex-officio member. As regards the financial arrangements to be made in the event; of the tuberculosis dispensary being handed over to the Borough Council I am to state that the Board could not undertake to reimburse the dispensary authorities any portion of the capital cost of the tuberculosis dispensary beyond the grant which the Board are now prepared to make. This grant will, subject to the consent of the Treasury, and to a satisfactory agreement being made with the Borough Council, amount to £375. The dispensary authorities should negotiate with the Borough Council as to the precise conditions on which the tuberculosis dispensary would be handed over in the event of the authorities failing to maintain it to the satisfaction of the Board, and the Board will need to be satisfied that any agreement which may be made in this matter will be legally enforceable." It will be seen from the correspondence that the Local Government Board stipulated that an agreement should be entered into between the Dispensary Authorities and the Council as to the precise conditions on which the Tuberculosis Dispensary would be handed over to the Council in the event of the Authorities failing to maintain it to the satisfaction of the Board; also that the agreement would be legally enforceable. The Trustees of the Dispensary submitted a draft agreement, which was carefully considered by the Council's Solicitors, Messrs. Davenport, Cunliffe and Blake, and amendments were made which brought it into agreement with the conditions made by the Council. A copy of this agreement as amended was submitted to the Local Government Board, and a reply was received, dated the 27th February, 1913, stating that the Board would be prepared to accept the agreement in the form proposed. The agreement as finally approved by the Council on the 19th March, 1913, reads as follows :— An Agreement made the 11th day of April, 1913, between Adolphus Edward Bridger, of Foley Lodge, 5. Langham Street, Portland Place, in the County of London, Gentleman, John Poland, of Home Cottage, Seal, in the County of Kent, Gentleman, and Herbert Peter Bodkin, of 23, Gordon Street, Gordon Square, in the County of London, Solicitor, Trustees of the St. Pancras Dispensary, 39, Oakley Square, St. Pancras, London (hereinafter called the Trustees), of the one part, and The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, in the 65 Administrative County of London (hereinafter called the Council) of the other part whereas the St. Pancras Dispensary was instituted in the year 1810 with the object of affording to poor persons medical and surgical attendance and medicine and for other purposes, and is supported by voluntary subscriptions and donations, and is managed by a Committee appointed annually by the Governors, and whereas the Committee of the St. Pancras Dispensary have recently purchased for £700 the lease of 39, Oakley Square aforesaid, and such lease is now vested in the Trustees for the residue of a term of 99 years from Lady-day, 1855. at a rent of £23, and whereas the said Committee have opened a department for the treatment of tuberculosis cases at 39, Oakley Square aforesaid, and have provided for the same certain fixtures, fittings, and apparatus, and whereas the Committee have, under the National Insurance Act, 1911, applied to the Local Government Board for a capital grant towards the cost of such department, but the said Board require as a condition precedent to making such grant that the Trustees and the Borough Council shall enter into the agreement hereinafter set out, now it is hereby Agreed between the Trustees and the Council as follows :— I. If at any time during the currency of the said lease the said Board shall, in writing, express to the Committee of the Dispensary their dissatisfaction with the manner in which the said tuberculosis department is being carried on, the Trustees will report to the Borough Council such expression of dissatisfaction, and will, on being requested so to do by the Council, and upon a resolution of the Committee to that effect, transfer to the Council such department and all the fixtures, fittings, and apparatus as then existing, and used in connection therewith, and the premises in which the said tuberculosis department shall be carried on upon the terms and conditions following, that is to say: — (a) Such request of the Borough Council shall be in writing under the hand of the Town Clerk for the time being, and shall embody the written expression of dissatisfaction as received from the Local Government Board, and shall be communicated to the Committee by service of the same upon their Secretary for the time being, or by letter addressed to him and forwarded by registered post, and shall state the date within a period not exceeding three months, on which they intend to take over the said department to the intent that from such date the Borough Council shall maintain the said department in accordance with the National Insurance Act, 1911. (h) Upon a resolution of the Committee authorising it the transfer shall be carried out by the Trustees granting to the Borough Council an underlease of so much of the premises, 39, Oakley Square aforesaid, as shall for the time being be set apart or used for the said tuberculosis department for the residue of the term granted by the 66 said lease except the last two days thereof, at such rent and on such proper terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Trustees and the Council, of which underlease the Council shall execute a counterpart. (c) The Borough Council shall take over the department as a going concern, with the staff employed in working the same, subject to the terms of the several engagements entered into by them with the Committee, and shall purchase and pay the Trustees for the fixtures, fittings, and apparatus as then existing, and used in connection with the department, at such price as may bo agreed upon between the Trustees and the Council. (d) Any dispute or failure to agree upon any of the foregoing terms of transfer shall be settled by arbitration under the Arbitration Act, 1889. II. This Agreement as regards the Trustees is provisional only, and shall not bind the Dispensary unless and until confirmed by resolutions of the Committee and the Trustees. On the 16th April, 1913, the Council appointed the following representatives on the Committee of Management of the Tuberculosis Dispensary:— Councillors G. Blount, Dr. K. II. A. Kellie, A. Davis, A. II. Edwards, G. Gardner, and the Rev. Z. B. Woffendale. Notification.—The compulsory notification of pulmonary tuberculosis has been progressive, and has come about in the following stages :—(1) the Regulations of 1908 which required Poor Law cases of pulmonary tuberculosis to be notified ; (2) the Regulations of 1911, which required hospital cases of pulmonary tuberculosis to be notified; and (3) the further Regulations of 1911, which required all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis to be notified. During the past year 1,772 certificates were received under these Regulations, including 806 from the Poor Law. The number of deaths was 326, as compared with 330, 297, and 374 during the three preceding years respectively. On the 20th December, 1912, the Local Government Board issued a further series of Regulations which consolidate and amend those above mentioned. These Regulations came into force on the 1st February, 1913, and apply to non-pulmonary as well as to pulmonary tuberculosis. During 1912 the number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis was 399. Compulsory notification has therefore proceeded by stages to its completion. Borough Scheme.—The St. Pancras scheme for the control, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis works out thus :— 1.—All cases diagnosed are medically certified to the Medical Officer of Health. 2.—To all cases certified a card of advice is sent. 67 3.—Any person can apply to the Officers of the Public Health Department for advice and as to the available means of assistance. 4.—The families of cases certified are visited for the purpose of inquiry and advice, where necessary, by the Woman Inspector or her assistant. 5. —Contacts, suspects, and susceptibles are given introduction cards to- the St. Pancras Dispensary for the purpose of medical examination, diagnosis, and report. 6.—The treatment of patients is referred to (a) Medical Practitioners, (h) Poor Law Authorities, (r) Hospitals and Public Dispensaries, (d) Private Dispensaries, Clubs, &c., and (e) to various Philanthropic Agencies. Provision for isolation of advanced cases of Consumption. The Council have on previous occasions urged that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should provide sanatoria and hospital accommodation for consumptives, and en the 13th July, 1910, thev resolved that a representation be made to the Metropolitan AsylumsBoard urging them to take immediate steps to provide a central home for incurable consumptive cases. In reply to this representation a communication was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the 10th July, 1910, pointing out that the Managers had no power without the consent of the Local Government Board to make provision for sanatoria for consumptives, and that although the subject had been frequently discussed, and several communications had been addressed to the Local Government Board on the matter, the Managers had hitherto received from the Board no official indication of the view they took thereon. Your Committee again considered the serious disability under which London is endeavouring to combat tuberculosis, having regard to the fact that there are no means of isolating far advanced cases. It is well known that these cases are the most infectious and the most difficult to nurse, and to prevent the spread of infection, accommodation for such cases is the most urgent of all. If such accommodation were provided, the difficulty experienced in dealing with the worst cases of this disease would vanish, inasmuch as, if the consulting officer certified that a case was unfit for a sanatorium, and the medical attendant or consulting officer certified that it, was fit for an " incurable " institution and urgently required to be removed thereto, insured persons in an advanced stage of consumption would feel that they had been provided with a sanatorium for incurables to which they could be removed by the Medical Officer of Health, if without proper lodging or accommodation for their disease. In regard to the statement made by the Metropolitan Asylums Board that they have no power to make provision for cases of consumption without the consent of the Local Government Board, since then, on the 18th February 1911, the Local Government Board made an Order by which they directed that the Asylums Board might, with their consent in writing, appropriate any of the fever or small-pox hospitals, or any part thereof, for the reception and treatment of such classes of poor persons as may be specified in the said 68 consent, and on the 30th May, 1911, and the 9th and 20th August, 1912, made further Orders, under Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 189], enabling the Metropolitan Asylums Board to receive persons into their hospitals, not being paupers, suffering from measles, whooping-cough and puerperal fever respectively. It only requires the extension of this policy to tuberculosis to overcome the grave difficulty standing in the way of treatment of advanced cases of the disease. If the Metropolitan Asylums Board would resolve to receive cases of tuberculosis, and if the Local Government Board would consent to such reception, limited as they might think fit to certain type or classes of cases as, for instance, advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, and would make an Order under Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, admitting nonpauper cases, it would then follow that the Borough Councils could, through their Medical Officers of Health, obtain the removal to the hospitals of the Asylums Board of both insured and uninsured persons in the advanced stages of the disease who were without proper lodging or accommodation adequate for their treatment and the protection of their families and the community. Thus, the most infectious form of tuberculosis would have the same advantage as other forms of infectious diseases in having proper provision made for its isolation and treatment, and uninsured as well as insured persons could be protected from infecting other persons, both insured and uninsured. Feeling strongly the urgent need for steps to be taken in this direction representations were made on the 30th October, 1912 (a) to the Local Government Board asking them to make an Order authorising the admission of advanced cases of consumption into the Metropolitan Asylums Board hospitals, and (b) to the Metropolitan Asylums Board asking them to agree to the admission of such cases into their hospitals. The following replies were received, viz.: — From the Local Government Board, dated 18th January, 1913, stating that the suggestions of the Borough Council have been uoted for consideration ; and From the Metropolitan Asylums Board, dated 1st April, 1913, stating that it is understood that the whole question of the provision by the Board of accommodation for cases of Tuberculosis is now under consideration by the Government Departments concerned, and that the views expressed by the Borough Council have been duly noted. A. Povvel Coke, Chief Clerk. 69 REPORT OF THE WOMAN INSPECTOR Upon the work done in St. Pancras during the year 1912 in connection with the prevention of Consumption. The Numbers. Paring the year 1912, the total number of cases notified as suffering from Consumption was 1196. During the previous year the corresponding number was 1015. These figures are of interest, in view of the fact that notification of all classes of consumptive patients became compulsory at the beginning of the year 1912. A table giving details as to the composition of this total appears elsewhere. We may note here in addition some figures of more special interest. The " Homeless" were fifty in number. Sixteen men and two women were notified from Common Lodging Houses, while sixty-one men came from Rowton Houses. We had thus a total of 129 persons known to be pronounced or advanced cases who were without any provision for adequate care, apart from their intermittent stay in Poor Law Institutions. One of the women is probably a typical case. When first notified several years ago she was a respectable dressmakers' worker, living at a private address. After a considerable interval she was notified as living at a Common Lodging House. When last notified she appeared among the homeless. At the beginning of the present year a Special Inquiry was made in order to ascertain how many of those notified during 1912 remained at the same address. Only 426 were found, and of these 128 were stated to be persons insured under the National Insurance Act. It is significant of the uncertain circumstances and advanced state of disease of those notified that so few were found still resident at the addresses originally notified. I desire here specially to mention the useful work done in connection with this Inquiry by Miss Mary Giles, who was appointed to give temporary help. She proved a most valuable assistant, and was well received, both by the patients and by our many friends among the voluntary workers of the Borough. The Patients. As has been noted in previous years the patients are for the most part respectable and industrious persons, whose illness is due to no fault of their own. In only twenty-one cases was the patients' home so dirty or uncared for as to call for special comment on the part of the visitor. Many patients were found working far beyond safe limits to maintain their homes, or to carefor their families. In sixty-three cases the investigation papers contain notes as to the inadequacy of the patients' food supply. No points of special interest emerge as to the connection of industrial conditions with the disease, except that a postman, a coal-porter, and a stoker complained of dusty conditions ; a newspaper tricycle boy of undue muscular strain ; a bandsman of the lung strain involved in blowing his instrument; two basement workers of 70 want of light and air; and a jeweller of the effect of his stooping position in a badly ventilated room. In four cases babies were found boarded-out with, or adopted by, consumptive patients, and efforts were made to remove these infants from the infected surroundings. Perhaps the most hopeless family visited was one in which out of twenty-five children, thirteen had died, and most of those remaining at home appeared to be tuberculous. There is greater readiness to take reasonable precautions for the avoidance of infection, but such precautions as the separate room, and even the separate bed, are beyond the means of most of our poor patients. Some attempt was made to effect segregation by arranging the sleepers head to feet in the same bed. In two cases children sent up as suspects to the Dispensary were found to be suffering only from ill-health, resulting from pediculosis capitis. It is not generally recognised by the mothers that actual ill-health results from dirty and unwholesome conditions of this kind, and our visitors are careful to explain this to the mothers visited. In many cases the patients have been delicate from childhood, or from early infancy. Some patients retard their possible improvement, and endanger their families by leaving Infirmary or Hospital too soon, or by lack of perseverance as outdoor patients. Some who would remain away indefinitely, in hope of cure, return home to die when hope is no longer possible. In 95 cases it was stated that no previous case of tuberculosis had occurred in the family. In 116 cases previous instances of the disease had occurred, or existed, in the families of the notified patients. The Dispensary. This Institution has been of enormous value. It is impossible to speak too warmly of the ready co-operation, both of the Committee and of the Staff, with the work of the Public Health Department, or of the consideration shown to every patient and coutact sent. The usefulness of alliance with the General Dispensary is continually apparent, for, on the one hand, the possession of tuberculosis by no means connotes the lack of every other physical ill, and, on the other hand, the general patients are a hunting ground for the special tuberculosis work. We have sent contacts and suspects in fair numbers, although not to the extent originally contemplated, and we find a very pleasing readiness to take advantage of help which involves neither label nor stigma. Owing to lack of funds, and to various delays and impediments, less has been done than was hoped and expected in the earlier days of our alliance, but even under all these difficulties, it has been evident that the Dispensary is one of the most valuable adjuncts to Public Health work which could possibly be desired. 71 The Borough Council addressed a communication to the London Insurance 'Committee, drawing attention to the small number of cases sent by that Committee to the Dispensary. Insured Patients. Persons insured under the National Insurance Act were permitted to apply for Sanatorium Benefit immediately after the Act came into force. During the latter part of the year 1912, therefore, considerable time was occupied both in dealing with individual cases of peculiar difficulty, and in trying to organize some mode of co-ordinating the work of the local Insurance Sub-Committee, of which the Medical Officer of Health, ex-officio, was a member, with the work of the Public Health Department. Twenty-nine special cases were dealt with by the Committee. During this period the London Insurance Committee sent certain cases away to Sanatoria, and decided to award to other cases treatment in their own homes. The cases dealt with at home were usually referred to the Medical Officer of Health, who was requested to arrange for the domiciliary treatment desired by the Committee. In the hope of providing a model for true Sanatorium treatment at home we devised, and in one case carried successfully into operation, a scheme which it may bo of interest to place on record. The scheme involved the close co-operation of the agents concerned in the care of the tuberculous insured persons. It assumed that every local Medical Practitioner treating an insured person was upon the Visiting Staff of the Borough Dispensary, and that the Borough Dispensary was regarded as an essential factor in the work of the Public Health Department. On receipt of the request from the Insurance Committee to arrange domiciliary treatment, the patient was visited by an Inspector of the Public Health Department to ascertain what individual doctor was preferred by the patient, and what were the patient's general circumstances and needs. The doctor selected by the patient was then requested to undertake the care of the patient, and on consenting to do so he drew up, usually in collaboration with the Inspector to whom the case was known, a list of necessaries which he considered essential to the patient's progress. This list, with an estimate of the probable cost, was submitted by the Medical Officer of Health to the Insurance Committee. If approved, the necessaries prescribed were obtained and supplied to the patient through the Dispensary Nurse, who visited the patient daily to give any nursing attention necessary, and to carry out any instructions of the doctor, and who brought up to the Inspector, and if necessary to the Medical Officer of Health, accounts, reports, and any special difficulties arising out of the patient's condition or the general needs of the family. It was hoped, by the establishment of an Invalid Kitchen, and by various frugal devices within the powers of the Dispensary, to arrive in time at a thoroughly efficient mode of treatment, at a very reasonable cost. The scheme worked perfectly in actual fact, but owing to financial difficulties it had to be abandoned. 72 The plan of working through local doctors, approached by the Medical Officer of Health, generally worked extremely well. In practically every case I saw and explained the situation to the doctor concerned. In no case was there any resentment aroused by the intervention of the Public Health Authority. In every case the medical practitioner was most kindly ready to help me with advice and information of the greatest use to my plans for the general care of the families. Had it been possible to continue this friendly co-operation of the medical profession with the Public Health Department, and with the Dispensary there can be no doubt that we should have attained results beyond all expectation. It is among the many disappointments of 1913 that this work has been wholly discontinued. No scheme, whether for dealing with insured or non-insured patients (a purely arbitrary decision from the Public Health point of view) can be satisfactory if the aim is merely the provision of medical advice and drugs. Consumption is not purely a medical matter, and on the frank recognition of the problem as one of medico-psycho-sociology depends much of the success of any measures devised, more particularly those which apply to the ignorant, the poor, and the helpless, who claim special care from such a Department as our own. Decentralization. As is mentioned in the Report upon Administrative Measures in relation to tuberculosis by the Chief Clerk of the Department, the Borough Council has commented upon the difficulties arising from central control of Sanatorium Benefit. How great and how real those difficulties have been can only be realized by those in intimate connection with individual cases. On the one hand the Central Authority is apt to make its decision without full knowledge of the whole circumstances of the patient. On the other hand the forms issued, and portions of the letters addressed to insured persons are puzzling to the less educated among our people. Both in visiting in the homes and at the Town Hall we have continual requests for help to hasten the action of theLondon Insurance Committee, to obtain the provision of supplementary necessaries, to explain the forms, and help in their filling in, and to interpret the phraseology of the communications. The introduction of an additional Authority into the Tuberculosis question,, which is essentially a Public Health matter, seems gravely to have complicated an already intricate and difficult subject. Our Needs. First, and as a condition of effective work in other directions, we needliberal help, both in money and personal service for our Dispensary. We need, in connection with the Dispensary, a system resembling that of the Sick Room Helps, so ably organized by Mrs. Model, in Whitechapel, to help in the care of the homes and children of our patients. We want an open air School for the pre-tuberculous, and a Day Hospital for the definitely notified cases among children. 73 Further provision for advanced cases is imperatively needed. Sanatorium accommodation for the non-insured, now very difficult to obtain, is a further crying necessity. An effective system of after care for returned Sanatorium patients is essential if the work done in the Sanatorium is not to be entirely wasted. To touch the affairs of a consumptive in any way is usually to involve oneself in responsibilities extending over a long period, and both individuals and authorities should recognize this. Co-ordination. Co-ordination is the word of the moment. In St. Pancras we have always aimed at making the Town Hall an informal centre for work which touches health matters, and we have been helped in the kindest way by individuals, and by Associations throughout the Borough Effective, as distinguished from theoretical, co-ordination can only be brought about by inducing some person to take much trouble in understanding and in communicating with the various persons and Societies concerned. I am more particularly indebted to the Public Welfare Association, the Organiser, and many members of Care Committees, the Secretary and many members of the Juvenile Advisory Committee, Poor Law Guardians, Schools for Mothers, and Nursery Schools. I hope also to establish a friendly connection with the treatment centre for School Children. There are many others to whom my warmest gratitude is due. M. E. Bibby. 74 GLANDERS. In Part VI. (Legislation) of the Animal Report for 1907 the London Order of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, dated 12th September, 1907, as to the Notification of Glanders in Horses was quoted, and also the Regulations of the London County Council thereunder. In Part III. (Infectious Diseases) of the same Annual Report paragraphs relating to human glanders were quoted, and it was explained that in future, by the Order, a Veterinary Inspector must report the existence of glanders to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough as well as to the County Council. During the year 1912, the Veterinary Inspector reported 6 outbreaks of glanders in horses in various stables in the Borough. § 3.-ISOLATION AND EXCLUSION.

On the loth December, 1909, your Council asked the Metropolitan Asylums Board to consider the necessity for providing hospital accommodation for puerperal septic diseases. On the 16th July, 1910, the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board resolved to inform the Local Government Board that they were prepared to make arrangements for the reception of certified cases of Puerperal Fever into their hospitals. On the 29th November, 1911, your Council resolved to ask the St. Pancras Board of Guardians to press upon their representatives at the Metropolitan Asylums Board the desirability of urging the Local Government Board to give their consent to the provision of accommodation for Puerperal Fever cases in the Asylum Board's hospitals. On the 20th May, 1912, the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board stated that the Board had not yet received the consent of the Local Government Board. On the 5th June your Council made representations upon the subject to the Local Government Board and the Members of Parliament representing the Borough. The number of Puerperal Fever cases notified during the four years, 1908 — 1911, was as follows :— 1908. 1909. 1910. 1911. Mean. St. Pancras 8 15 14 16 13 London . . 228 287 292 302 277 The reason for the apparent increase is due to the notification at an earlier stage of the symptoms of the disease, and from the preventive point of view, a great advance in the possibilities of early treatment and saving of life. In London, of less than 300 cases a year, only a proportion would require hospital treatment, but in these cases it would be urgent, and putting this proportion as high as a half, say 150, each case lasting say a month to six weeks, then a provision of two dozen beds would cover the requirements of the Metropolis. It is the extreme urgency of this disease in small dwellings, and not the magnitude of its prevalence that calls for hospital provision. Questions were addressed to the President of the Local Government Board by Captain H. M. Jessel, m.p., and Mr. Felix Cassel, k.c., m.p., to which the following reply was given:— " The question of further extending the functions of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in various directions, including that referred to in the question, has been and still is engaging my attention. Recently the Managers have, under my authority, made arrangements for the reception of cases of measles and whooping cough. Cases of this kind were not previously received by the Managers. In addition 9,000 sick and weakly children have been treated by the Managers at two hospitals formerly used for infectious cases. The Hon. Member is, no doubt, aware that the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis have raised the question whether the Managers should not be empowered to provide sanatorium beds for London. I hope that satisfactory arrangements will shortly be carried through for dealing with cases of puerperal fever." 76 On the 20th August, 1912, the Local Government Board issued an Order under Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prescribing regulations and restrictions under which non-pauper cases of puerperal fever may be received into the hospitals provided by the Board of Management of the Metropolitan Asylum District. The Order provides that such non-pauper cases shall be received into hospitals of the Board of Management only when there is room available beyond the requirements of pauper cases of puerperal fever. These cases may only be admitted upon the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health of the locality in which the person is residing, and the recommendation must be accompanied by such information respecting the circumstances of the case as the Board of Management require. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR WHOOPING COUGH. On the 9th August, 1912, the Local Government Board made an Order under Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prescribing regulations and restrictions under which non-pauper cases of whooping cough may be received into the hospitals provided by the Board of Management of the Metropolitan Asylum District. Similar conditions attach to the admission of these cases to the hospitals as are referred to in the Order relating to puerperal fever. 77 EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL ON ACCOUNT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND DISORDERS.

THE CLEANSING OF CHILDREN. During the year the baths were used by 1 ,292 adults (males, 1,263; females, 29). The children bathed numbered 2,822. Bedfellows of children to the number of 642 were also cleansed. The addresses given by the male adults included Rowton Houses, 164; Common Lodging Houses, 787; and 281 stated that they had slept in the open on the night previous to making application. The children resorting to the baths from the schools in the Borough have received a considerable amount of attention during the year, and numerous visits have been paid to their homes by the Woman Inspector. The statutory powers of the Council for dealing with the cleansing of verminous persons are briefly as follows: — 81 The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, empowers the Borough Council to expend money in providing a cleansing station. The General Powers Act, 1904, enables the Borough Council to deal with the homes. The General Powers Act, 1907, confers compulsory powers on the County Council for the removal of verminous school children and verminous inmates of common lodging houses to cleansing stations. The Children Act, 1908, enlarges the powers with regard to school children, and compels the Borough Council to permit the use of their cleansing station by the local education authority for the cleansing of school children upon an agreed payment. On the 20th May, 1912, an agreement was entered into with the London County Council, renewable at the end of one year upon terms, for the cleansing of verminous school children who may be sent by the County Council to this Authority's Cleansing Station upon a payment of 2s. in respect of each child, to cover a period of one calendar month from the date upon which the tirst cleansing takes place irrespective of the number of baths required before the child could be regarded as cleansed. Up to the 31st March, 1913, the sum of £84 12s. 0d. has been received from the County Council. On the 3rd July, 1912, your Council informed the County Council, in answer to their enquiry, whether it would be possible for arrangements to be made whereby verminous children attending schools within a mile radius of the Station may be cleansed, that so far as possible, after the children residing in the Borough and those attending schools in the Borough had been cleansed, this Authority were prepared to cleanse verminous children attending schools outside the Borough within a radius of one mile of the Station upon payment of 1s. per attendance. Subsequently a reply was received from the Education Officer of the London County Council stating that the Committee of the County Council who had considered the subject were advised that the agreement entered into between the two Authorities required the Borough Council to cleanse any school children who may be sent to such Station by the County Council upon payment of 2s. in respect of each child to cover a period of one calendar month, provided that they were in attendance at public elementary schools maintained by the County Council, and hoping that the Borough Council would raise no objection to cleansing, at the rate referred to in the Agreement, all school children requiring such treatment who attended schools within a mile radius of the Station. In regard to this further communication your Council pointed out that the agreement between the Borough Council and the County Council never contemplated the question of cleansing children from outside the Borough. It was obvious that the interpretation placed upon the agreement by the County Council's Committee would entitle the County Council to send all the school children in London to the St. Pancras Cleansing Station, which would be unreasonable, and, therefore, could never have been intended by either party. This new interpretation arose since the County Council gave instructions to limit the cleansing area to within a radius of a mile from the Station. In further proof of the fact that children outside St. Pancras were never intended to be included in the original agreement, the arrangement shortly afterwards 82 entered into by the Borough Council with the County Council in respect of the cleansing of inmates of common lodging houses specially provided for the cleansing of inmates of houses outside the Borough at the charge of 1s. per attendance, and it was upon this last arrangement that your Committee based their proposal in regard to cleansing children from outside the Borough. Since the agreement was made between the Authorities and the mile radius arrangement was adopted by the County Council, it was ascertained that in North St. Pancras the following schools were treated as outside the mile radius, namely,—Carlton Road, St. Dominic's, Fortess Road, Burghley Road, Mansfield Road, and St. Anne's, Brookfield, and only the following North St. Pancras schools were treated as inside the mile radius, and their children brought to the Cleansing Station, namely,—Falkland Road, Holmes Road, Wilkin Street, and Rhyl Street School. Your Council were strongly of opinion that the verminous children from all the schools in St. Pancras should be brought to the St. Pancras Cleansing Station, and if necessary by conveyance, and passed the following resolutions on the 30th October:— (a) That this Authority do not agree to children from outside St. Pancras being admitted to their Cleansing Station on the same terms as those who are resident within the Borough, and they adhere to their previous decision that such children should only be dealt with after the children in St. Pancras have been attended to, and that the rate of payment in respect of the children attending schools outside the Borough within a mile radius of the Cleansing Station should be 1s. per attendance. (b) The Borough Council strongly desire that the children from the whole of the Borough who require cleansing should be cleansed at the St. Pancras Cleansing Station, and are of opinion that if the distance of any part of St. Pancras is considered sufficiently far to require it, the County Council should provide means of conveying children who may need cleansing to the Station. The subject has not been further pursued by the County Council so that at present the verminous school children cleansed are (1) those residing in and attending schools in the Borough and their bed-fellows; (2) those attending schools in the Borough and residing outside, but in these cases the bed-fellows are not cleansed at the Station. Cleansing of Inmates of Common Lodging Houses Outside St. Pancras.—On the 17th January, 1912, your Council reported in regard to the arrangement made with the London County Council for the cleansing of persons at this Authority's Cleansing Station sent from common lodging houses in other Boroughs, and recommended that the County Council be asked to agree that the cleansing of such persons who presented themselves at the Cleansing Station might be there and then carried out, and the payment of 1s. per attendance be made upon notification being received from the Borough Council's Officers that the cleansing had taken place. This recommendation was made in order to obviate the necessity of refusing persons admission to the Cleansing Station until they had obtained an order from the Lodging 83 House Inspector of the County Council, as it was found that when persons were informed that they would have to obtain this they did not return for cleansing. A communication was received from the County Council, in reply, stating that, after very careful consideration of all the facts, they were prepared, so far as the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras was concerned, to adopt for the next six months, as an experiment, the undermentioned variation of the scheme of cleansing hitherto in vogue, viz.:— " The Borough Council to cleanse forthwith any applicant who claims to " be an inmate of a common lodging house, and the Council will, on " the receipt of a claim from the Borough Council, pay 1s. for each " person cleansed who can be identified as coming from a common " lodging house situated outside the Borough, the names and " addresses of the persons to be supplied to the Council immediately " the cleansing has been carried out." As the proposal of the County Council ensured payment for persons cleansed only when identified as coming from lodging houses situated outside the Borough, your Council considered it necessary for the per-ons attending to produce some evidence which would so identify them, and they, therefore, suggested that the admission cards in use at the Station be supplied to the Superintendents of common lodging houses adjoining the Borough, so that they might give them to any of the inmates of their lodging houses who desired to come to St. Pancras for cleansing. The County Council were therefore informed, on the 24th April, that if the suggested use of these cards be agreed to, this Authority were prepared to carry out the proposed experiment. Subsequently a reply was received from the County Council stating that, to meet the wishes of this Authority, they had arranged for keepers and deputies of common lodging houses outside St. Pancras to be supplied with vouchers, signed by their Inspector, authorising the bearer to be cleansed, and for the Inspector to call at the Council's cleansing station each week for the purpose of obtaining particulars of those persons from common lodging houses outside the Borough who had been cleansed. A payment of 1s. per person so cleansed to be made by the County Council. This proposal was agreed to, and the County Council were so informed on the 12th June. The sum of £5 8s. 0d. has been received in respect of this work up to the 31st March, 1013. 84 § 5.—VACCINATION—The following are the Returns kindly supplied by the Clerk to the Guardians:— Return respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in the Parish of Saint Pancras, from 1st January to 31st December, 1911, inclusive.

Smoke—In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There are 343 smoke shafts on the Register ; 600 observations of these were taken, and 110 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes, and often twice as long. The Inspectors are now instructed to limit their observation of a chimney to half an hour, and only to prolong it beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. (See Minutes of Public Health Committee of 30th January, 1907.) Effluvia. — Of various businesses and places producing effluvia or offensive emanations there are 132 on the Registers, and of these 163 inspections and 18 re-inspections were made.

(a) House-to-House Inquiries and Inspection.—(i) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting 301 inquiries and 390 re-visits were made as to the occupation of houses in tenemented streets, (ii) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house, a complete inquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house. (iii) When it has been decided to register a tenement house, each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters are made were quoted in the Annual Report for 1904. (b) Tenement Houses.—During the year 91 inspections and 21 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2358 houses were upon the Register. Of these houses 2424 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 5396 re-inspections after the service of notices ; also of the 207 dwellings entered in the Register of Inscribed Dwellings, 84 inspections were made, and 436 re-inspections after the service of notices. The following is a record relating to registered tenement houses:— On Register in 1911 2353 Registered during 1912 11 Total 2364 Ceased to be registered houses in 1912 6 On Register at end of 1912 2358 97 By-laws relating to Tenement Homes.—The question of the amendment of the By-laws of this Authority relating to houses let in lodgings was again under consideration. It has formed the subject of prolonged negotiations in the past with the Local Government Board and the London County Council, but has remained unsettled owing to the difficulty experienced in arriving at a satisfactory exemption clause. The Local Government Board suggested a clause fixing a limit of rental under which a house should be registerable, but this was found to be impracticable in St. Pancras having regard to the varying conditions of occupation in different parts of the Borough, and the proposal made by this Council to have an exemption clause fixing a limit to the degree of sub-letting (i.e., number of rooms in the separate dwellings) which should make the house registerable was not acceptable to the Board. The chief difficulty experienced in the case of exemption has been found to be that the desire to exclude houses which do not require regulation from the operation of the By-laws was apt to lead to the adoption of a clause which exempted houses particularly requiring regulation. The Local Government Board appointed an Inspector to hold a Local Inquiry in the Borough in regard to the amendment of the Council's Tenement House By-laws, and the Inquiry was held in the Town Hall on the 15th and 22nd September, 1908. Sir Shirley Murphy, the late Medical Officer to the London County Council, who was under examination at the Inquiry, was asked whether he was prepared to suggest for the consideration of the Board that no exemption or limitation clause should be inserted in the Tenement House By-laws, when he replied: "Yes, I think that is the best solution because it would then give the Borough Council all the powers they needed to deal with the houses that specially require regulation. They would not be hampered or limited by anything in the By-laws, and, further, it would preserve for the London County Council that position that is given it by the Act of Parliament, but which is lost in some degree, and very often in a very material degree, if exemptions are put in. Of course, in the application of sanitary laws there must be the exercise of discretion, and I do not, myself, see why the Borough Council of St. Pancras should not accept the responsibility of exercising that discretion, and so long as the regulations are administered in a bona-fide way, as we have every reason to hope they would be, then no difficulty would arise. I will not be invidious by speaking of St. Pancras, but take the position of the County Council with regard to the districts of London generally. If a sanitary authority under those circumstances be lax in its administration it would preserve for the County Council the power of intervention which Parliament obviously intended it should exercise if necessity arose." This view against the advisability of including an exemption clause in the By-laws commended itself to your Public Health Committee, and they were of opinion that the present By laws did not in that respect require amendment. The London County Council subsequently called attention to Section 16 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, which extends the power of making By-laws with respect to lodging houses for the working classes, and 98 stated that they were advised that the Section referred to reverses, in effect, the decision of the Divisional Court in 1909 in Arlidge r. Islington Borough Council (73 .T.P., 301), so far as that decision applies to lodging houses intended for the working classes. With reference to the Arlidge case, the Divisional Court held that the Islington By-law as to cleansing made under Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was unreasonable, and, therefore, void, as it cast upon landlords an obligation which they might not be able to obey without committing a breach of the peace or trespass. J he provisions of Section 16 of the Act of 1909, however, do not validate By-laws made under Section 94 of the Act of 1891 if made before the xVct of 1909 came into force. The County Council stated that it was, therefore, necessary that any By-laws made before the Act of 1909 became law should be remade in order to make them effective with regard to the landlords of lodging houses intended for the working classes, and suggested the desirability of the Borough Council remaking their present By-laws under Section 94 of the Act of 1891, and proposed that in doing so it might be considered desirable to include a requirement for the separation of the sexes in sleeping rooms. Were it not for the passing of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, it might be necessary to remake the By-laws, but inasmuch as the effect of the Town Planning Act will be to call for periodical inspection of the class of houses which would, amongst others, be included on the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings, it did not appear to your Council necessary to amend the By-laws in question, as it was anticipated that the inspections carried out under the Town Planning Act would very largely supersede inspection under the powers conferred by the Tenement House By-laws. For these reasons your Council informed the London County Council on the 15th May, 1912, that this Authority did not consider it necessary to take action to amend the By-laws relating to Tenement Houses. Inspections under the Housing and Toicn Planning Act, 1909.—Consideration was given as to the procedure to be adopted in carrying out the obligations imposed upon the Council under this Act in regard to the inspection of houses in the Borough. Under Section 17 of the Act it is enacted that it shall be the duty of every local authority to cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district with a view to ascertaining whether any dwelling house therein is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. In connection with this provision the Local Goverment Board made Regulations (dated 2nd September, 1910), known as the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910, in which it is provided that the local authority shall, as part of their procedure, make provision for a thorough inspection, to be carried out from time to time according to the varying needs or circumstances, of the dwelling houses or localities- in the district of the local authority, and shall cause to be prepared from time to time by the Medical Officer of Health a list, or lists of dwelling houses the early inspection of which is in his opinion desirable. 99 The list or lists may, if thought fit, relate to the dwelling houses within a defined area of the district without specifying each house separately therein. The Officer making the inspection of any dwelling house shall examine the state thereof in relation to the following matters, viz.:— 1. The arrangements for preventing the contamination of the water supply. 2. Closet accommodation. 3. Drainage. 4. The condition of the dwelling house in regard to light, the free lation of air, dampness, and cleanliness. 5. The paving, drainage, and sanitary condition of any yard or outhouses belonging to or occupied with the dwelling house. 6. The arrangements for the deposit of refuse and ashes. 7. The existence of any room which would in pursuance of Sub-section 7 ot' Section 17 of the Act of 1909 be a dwelling house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. 8. Any defects in other matters which may tend to render the dwelling house dangerous or injurious to the health of an inhabitant. Records of such inspection are to be prepared under the direction and supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. In considering as to the carrying out of these matters, your Council had their attention directed by the Medical Officer of Health to the fact that there were about 2,365 houses in the Borough on the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings which, in addition to the houses on the InscribedXist, were already periodically inspected, and he proposed that the whole of the houses in the streets in which the majority of the registered and the inscribed houses were situated should be taken as those areas which should be selected for inspection under the provisions of the Town Planning Act. He had selected the streets in that manner for inclusion in the list, and there were found to be 3,834 houses therein. In regard to the inspection of the drainage of the houses as required by the Regulations, your Council were of opinion that the word "drainage" therein could not reasonably be interpreted to mean the testing of all the drains of every house every six months, but to refer to the general inspection of its conditions which would only lead to testing if there were nuisances suggesting obvious defects or some complaint made revealing obvious nuisance. The following arrangements for carrying out the duties above referred to were approved and adopted by the Borough Council on the loth May, 1912:— (a) That the whole of the houses in the streets in which the majority of the houses are at present registered or inscribed for the purpose of half-yearly inspection, as drawn up by the Medical Officer of Health, be adopted as the. areas to be inspected half-yearly, or as nearly so as possible, by the Sanitary Inspectors. 100 (b) That the results of these inspections be recorded on a case paper for each separate house. (c) That a model case paper containing the particulars required by the Local Government Board be drawn up by the Medical Officer of Health and be adopted and printed for the use of the department. (d) That from the case papers reports be prepared periodically for the information of the Public Health Committee, the Council, and the Local Government Board. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING ACT, 1909.

For the purpose of periodical inspection a list of Inscribed Dwellings is also kept. This list includes— 1.— Cottages of one, two, three, or more rooms occupied by one family and which cannot be registered, e.g. Equity Buildings. 2.— Dwellings over Stables which require periodical inspection, but cannot be registered, e.g., Wakefield Mews. 3.—Houses in certain areas represented under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, some of which are registerable and some not, e.g., Chapel Grove, and Eastnor Place areas. 4.— Tenement Houses let in separate dwellings, but in which the dwellings are not separately assessed, or, if separately assessed, in which the dwellings do not differ in arrangement or construction from those in an ordinary tenement house, but which houses, it may be contended, are not registerable as a whole. 5.— Working Class Flats habitually overcrowded or kept in an insanitary condition. (c) Underground Dwellings.—At the end of the year there were on the Register 435 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and have been ordered to be closed, and of which 131 inspections have been made and 30 re-inspections after notices served. Time is allowed to the occupants of these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the time allowed the illegallv occupied rooms are kept under observation, and the number vacated or otherwise occupied ascertained and reported. The houses in which these dwellings are found are added to the register of registered tenement houses. 101 (d) Common Lodging Houses.—There are 8 registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council. Rowton Houses are not so registered; of these there are in St. Pancras one at the southern end of King's Cross Road, in South St. Pancras, and another at the northern end of Arlington Road, in West St. Pancras. (e) Canal Boat Dice/Zings.—During the year 76 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal.

HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. Goldingtoii Buildings.—Your Public Health Committee considered as to the increase in the loss of rent by empties at Goldingtoii Buildings. These Buildings were opened for the reception of tenants in June, 1904. Excluding the first nine months when they were only partially occupied, the following figures show the loss from empties:— Year ended. £ s. d. 31st March, 1906 53 8 0 equal to 3½ per cent. „ 1907 122 11 0 „ 8 „ „ 1908 26 3 0 „ 2 „ „ 1909 111 12 0 „ 7.4 „ „ 1910 102 13 0 „ 6.8 „ „ 1911 127 4 6 „ 8.4 „ „ 1912 193 6 9 „ 12.8 „ 1st April, 1912, to 30th Sept., 1912 111 16 6 „ 14.2 „ The high percentage of empties is due to a large extent to the fewness in the number of two-room flats, as the experience at Goldingtoii Buildings, Flaxman Terrace, and Prospect Terrace is that tenants can nearly always be found for two-room flats, but not so readily in the case of three-room flats. At Goldingtoii Buildings there are only 2 two-room flats as compared with 48 three-room flats; while at Flaxman Ter race the proportion is 36 to 48, and at Prospect Terrace 34 to 36, respectively. 102 It was felt that the flats would let better if the rents were lowered, and your Public Health Committee recommended that the scale of weekly rentals at Goldingtoii Buildings fixed by the Council on the 20th April, 1904, be varied by the rents of the undermentioned flats being reduced as follows:— Flats of three rooms. Seven on ground floor from 11s. 3d. to 10s. 6d. per week. Eight on first ,, ,, 12s. 0d. „ l1s. 56d. ,, Nine on second ,, „ l1s. 3d. „ 10s. 9d. „ Flats of four rooms. One on second floor from 15s. 0d. to 14s. 0d. per week. One on third „ ,, 14s. 6d. ,, 13s. 6d. ,, These alterations were approved by your Council on the 18th December, 1912.

Flaxman Terrace. These flats continue to let exceedingly well. During the year the loss from empties only amounted to £9 10s. 6d. (equal to .46 per cent.) out of a gross rental of £2,067. The sum of £16 4s. 0d. was also received for the use of the perambulator and bicycle sheds. Prosper Terrace. These flats also continue to let well. The loss from empties only amounted to £10 16s. 6d. (equal to .62 per cent.) out of a gross rental of £1758 5s. 6d. A sum of £10 4s. 2d. was also received for the use of the sheds, and £203 4s l1d. from the baths, as compared with £190 7s. 4d for the previous year. There is a credit balance of £211 6s. 5½d. on the Golding-ton Buildings Account. £700 9s. 8½d, on the Flaxman Terrace Account, and £318 7s. 11½d. on the Prospect Terrace Account, making a total of £1230 4s. 1½d. now standing to the credit of the Repairs Funds at 31st March, 1913. UNDERGROUND ROOMS. Underground Dwellingx. - These are controlled under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sections 96, 97 and 98. Underground Sleeping Rooms.—On the 20th December, 1911, your Council submitted for approval to the Local Government Board a series of draft regulations made under Section 17 (7) of the Housing and Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, as to underground rooms habitually used for sleeping purposes. Section 17 (7) reads as follows:— A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a dwelling house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either— (a) is not on an average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling; or (b) does not comply with such regulations as the local authority, with the consent of the Local Government Board, may prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation : Provided that if the local authority, after being required to do so by the Local Government Board, fail to make such regulation or such regulations as the Board approve, the Board may themselves make them, and the regulations so made shall have effect as if they had been made by the local authority with the consent of the Board. Provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which this sub-section applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place ; and that, if the occupier of the room 104 after notice of an order has been served upon him fails to comply with the order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, be made against him: A communication was subsequently received from the Local Government Hoard acknowledging the receipt of these draft regulations, and stating that a series of regulations in strict accordance therewith could, if the Council sodesired, be submitted to the Board for their consent. It was, however, pointed out that the Board had caused inspection to be made of a number of rooms in Metropolitan areas coming within the provisions of section 17 (7) of the Housing and Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, and upon the information obtained they had further considered the form which it was advisable the regulations under the section should take. They were advised that regulations for securing light and ventilation which were based primarily on the height of the room above the surface of the ground and on the width of the area in front of the room did not afford in all circumstances a satisfactory working rule, and they had prepared a series of regulations with a view toremoving this objection. The Board forwarded a copy of these regulations for the consideration of the Council. Your Council decided that the amended regulations submitted by the Local Government Board should be accepted, and they were approved and adopted on the 5th February, 1913. The regulations are as follows:— Every room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room shall comply with the following regulations namely:— 1. The subsoil of the site of the room shall be effectually drained by means of a subsoil drain properly trapped and ventilated wherever the dampness of the site renders such a precaution necessary. 2. Every drain passing under the room other than a drain for the drainage of the subsoil of the site of the room shall be gas-tight and water-tight. 3. The room shall be effectually protected against the rising of any effluvium or exhalation by means of a layer of asphalte or of good concrete at least six inches thick or four inches thick if properly grouted laid upon the ground of the site of the entire room or in some equally effectual manner. 4. The space, if any, beneath the floor of the room shall be provided with adequate means of ventilation. 5. (i) Every wall of the room shall be provided with a proper horizontal damp-proof course which if the floor of the room be formed of woodwork shall be beneath the level of the lowest timbers or woodwork of such floor, and in every other case shall be not less than one inch below the level of the upper surface of such floor. (ii) No part of any wall of the room shall where it is practicable to avoid it be in contact with the ground or earth. Provided that 105 where any wall of the room is in contact with the ground or earth such wall or such part thereof as is so in contact shall unless constructed as a hollow wall have an efficient vertical damp-proof course extending from the base thereof to a height of at least six inches above the surface of such ground or earth. 6. Unless the room is provided with a fireplace and a flue properly constructed and properly connected with such fireplace, it shall be provided with special and adequate means of ventilation by one or more suitably placed apertures or air shafts. 7. An area or open space properly paved with impervious material and effectually drained by means of a properly trapped gully shall adjoin the room and extend either throughout the entire length of one side thereof or at least throughout the entire width of any window or windows required by these regulations and (except where the area of such windows shall be of not less extent than one-seventh of the floor area of the room) for three feet on both sides of such window or windows. Such area or open space shall be not less than two feet wide in every part thereof and shall be open upwards from a level three inches below the level of the damp-proof course in the adjoining wall of the room. Provided (a) that where a bay window in the room having side lights overlooks such area the width thereof in front of such window may be one foot at the least and (b) that any steps necessary for access to any part of the building comprising the room may be placed in or over such area if they are so placed as not to be over or across any window of the room required by the regulation in that behalf. 8. (i) The room shall be effectually lighted by means of one or more windows opening directly into the external air. (ii) Every such window shall be so constructed that one-half at the least may be opened and that the opening may extend to the top of the window. (iii) The total area of such window or windows clear of the sash frames shall be equal at the least to one-eighth of the floor area of the room, and a portion of such total area equal in extent to at least one-tenth of such floor area shall be so situated that a line making an angle of 30 degrees with a horizontal plane can be drawn upwards from any point thereon in a vertical plane at right angles to the plane of the window so as not to intersect within a distance of ten feet measured horizontally from the window of any wall of any area adjoining the room or any other wall or any kerb or other obstruction except an open fence. For the purposes of this paragraph a bay window having side lights shall be assumed to be equivalent to a flat window of the same area and of the same height in relation to the room and situated at a distance from the outside area wall equal to the mean width of the area. 106 (iv) In estimating the area of a window or windows for the purpose of this regulation no account shall be taken of any part of any such window which is above the mean level of the ceiling of the room. (v) Any such window or windows shall overlook the area or open space provided in pursuance of the regulation in that behalf. The Common Seal of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras was affixed hereto this 17th day of March, 1913. By Order, C. Barrett, Town Clerk. The Consent of the Local Government Board is hereby given to the foregoing' Regulations this 2nd dav of April, 1913. H. C. Monro, Secretary. Acting on behalf of the said Board under the authority of their General Order dated the 26th day of May, 1877. § 4.—SCHOOLS. The Board of Education having decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children under the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins, many authorities are •ceasing to admit school children from three to five years of age. Infectious Diseases as concerning schools is dealt with in Part III., § 3, Isolation and Exclusion. § 5—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 408 and the Women Inspectors 107 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 37 and 1 inspections of factories respectively were made, and 27 and 1 re-inspections after notices served. Workshops.—The Men Inspectors had 1314 fapart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 404 workshops apart from laundries) on the Registers for periodical Inspection. During the year 270 and 7 inspections respectively of these premises were made, and 117 and 0 re-inspections after notices. 107 Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—The Woman Inpector has 71 of these on the Register, of which 0 inspections were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of year. Laundries.—On the Register are 74 laundries, at which the Woman Inspector made 4 inspections. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Men Inspectors had 175 and the Woman "Inspector 158 on the Registers. At the former 99 inspections and 0 re-inspections were made, and at the latter 22 inspections and 0 re-inspections. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 167 workshopbakehouses. Of these, and of the five factory bakehouses and the three bakehouses in hotels, 286 inspections and 321 re-inspections were made. Offensive Trade and Effluvia Businesses.—These are dealt with under the section relating to Nuisances.

During the year 1912 the general pressure of the work of our Section of the Department has been so great, and the special claims of the Tuberculosis problem have been so insistent, that very little inspection of workplaces where women are employed has been done. Unless the development of our Tuberculosis scheme relieves me very considerably of special duties I shall be compelled to ask for some assistance in order to carry out the duties for which T was originally appointed. The work of our part of the Public Health Department has grown enormously, both in extent and complexity, since my appointment eleven years ago, and the organisation and co-ordination which are essential to the frictionless running of our machinery, occupy a very large portion of my time. Very few complaints as to the condition of womens' workplaces were received during the year. Although this may indicate that their general condition is not markedly bad, which I believe to be the case, it is very desirable that inspection should be resumed with as little delay as possible. Quite apart from the discovery of contraventions of the law, inspection is important as keeping both employers and employed in touch with the official who has special interest in the health of employed women and girls. I have sent out the usual reminders to actual and possible employers of outworkers with a view to their duly sending in the required lists. I have also distributed the names and addresses of outworkers to their respective Boroughs when not resident in St. Pancras. With a view to obtaining information as to any special need for my intervention I have joined the voluntary and the official Committees formed for the care of the employment of young persons, and have found reason to believe that this connection has been reciprocally helpful. The close connection of other social problems with that of industrial employment is, perhaps, a sufficient reason for temporary neglect of the direct, in favour of the indirect, care of our industrially employed women, but I am exceedingly anxicus to take such steps as shall ensure that routine inspection is resumed with the least delay possible.

The substitution of mechanical for horse traction is rapidly reducing theamount of horse droppings in the roadways and the amount of manure stored in mews, and incidentally the number of flies. § 9— NUISANCES, &c. Offensive Trades.—The two licensed noxious trade premises in St. Pancras have been regularly inspected, and the tallow-melting works in Tudor Place have been kept under continual observation. Effluvia Businesses.—In addition to the above businesses producing offensive effluvia, the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, a fish-curer, and a rag and bone dealer have been brought under control by Section 10, Part II., Sanitary Provisions, of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1898. By this section the County Council may make by-laws for regulating the conduct of these businesses, and with respect to the premises, utensils, and appliances used in connection with these businesses, and it is the duty of the Borough Councils to enforce these by-laws. The framing of these by-laws is still under consideration. Smoke.— During the year the usual observations of smoke shafts were made by the Inspectors, and re-inspections made after notices served. The Inspectors limit their observations of a chimney to half an hour, and only prolong the observation beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. § 10.—SUMMONSES.

Fond Infection.—As usual, the places where food is prepared and sold have been frequently inspected and the stock examined, and with few exceptionshave been found satisfactory. The cowhouses and slaughterhouses have also been regularly visited. A large number of animals were killed and dressed at the slaughterhouses during the course of the inspections, the carcases and organs being subsequently carefully examined with a view to the detection of disease. The markets and market streets have been specially inspected on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the four summer months from June to September. Councillor C. A. Coggan and the Chief Clerk attended the annual meeting of the London County Council on the 28th October, 1912, for the licensing of slaughterhouses and cowhouses. Your Council received a report from their representatives that the County Council's Public Health Committee, upon receiving objections from their Inspector, refused to renew a slaughterhouse license at No. 10, Charlotte Mews, in this Borough, the reason of the objection being that guts were kept upon the premises contrary to the provisions of the by-laws regulating the conduct of the business of a slaughterer of cattle. An appeal was, however, made by the applicants to the County Council on the 19th November, 1912, when the decision of their Public Health Committee was reversed and the license in question renewed. Objection was also raised by the County Council to the renewal of the. slaughterhouse license at No. 3, Prince of Wales Crescent, on the ground that the premises were unsuitable for the purpose, but at the adjourned meeting of 116 the Committee it was decided to renew the license after hearing the views of this Authority. In the first-mentioned case attention was called to the fact that, although the County Council's Inspector found a breach of the by-laws at the slaughterhouse, no notice thereof was given to this Authority, as is always done in respect of nuisances found on other premises, If an intimation of an infringement had been received, a notice could have been promptly served in regard thereto. The County Council were therefore asked, on the 27th November, that in future in all cases where breaches of the by-laws were found to exist in this Borough, information be forthwith forwarded to the Borough Council so that inquiries may be made, and, if necessary, notices served in respect thereof. This practice has since been adopted. SUMMONSES.—MILK PREMISES. Under the Dairies. Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885; Amending Order, 1886. Situation. Offence.

In 46 cases summonses were issued, with the result that penalties were inflicted amounting to £85 19s. Od., and costs £33 2s. Od., which have been recovered and paid to this authority. The following table shows the number of samples analysed during the last nine years, and the number and percentage of adulterated samples:— Year. Number of samples analysed.

Sale ot Mill; irit/i Added Water. — X communication was received from the fctepney Borough Council, forwarding copy of a report upon the result of legal proceedings which were instituted against a milkman in their Borough for selling milk adulterated with water,—the case being dismissed inasmuch as the purchaser admitted to the Magistrate that she knew she was getting milk and water. The Stepney Council pointed out that the report emphasises the fact that it is a good defence in legal proceedings if the milkman declares to the purchaser that the article sold is milk and water, and that this is frequently done if the milkman recognises or suspects the Inspector or his agent. Considering the time had arrived when the sale of milk with added water for human food should be prohibited by Statute, they asked, the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture to take the necessary steps to insert a provision tothat effect in the proposed Milk Bill. Your Council concurred with this opinion, and a similar representation was made to the Local Government Board and the Hoard of Agriculture on the 3rd July, 1912. 121 Summon.—Under the Stile of Foocl and Drugs Aets—Adulteration.

Sir, I submit herewith my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1912. Markets.—The market streets, costermongers' barrows, stalls, fish shops, and curing premises have been inspected daily, 2,058 inspections being made. The following articles of food have been destroyed, the same being unsound •or diseased, and unfit for human food:— Oranges, 3 boxes. Rabbits, 6. Plums, 24 lbs. Food linkers.—I have made 370 inspections where food is prepared, such as sausage polonies, pies, &c., and have found all the ingredients used sound, wholesome, and fit for food, and the premises generally in a clean and sanitary condition. Ice Cream Makers.—117 inspections have been made by me, and I have not found it necessary to report to the Committee any cases for prosecution. Slaughter-houses.—I have made 230 inspections of the slaughter-houses in my district, and have not found any diseased or unsound animals; the premises have been kept clean, and the London County Council By-laws properly observed by the holders of licenses. Coiwsheds.—There are two licensed cowsheds in my district, registered for 43 cows. 29 inspections have been made, the animals kept clean, and the London County Council's By-laws observed. Milkshops and Dairies — I have made 330 inspections of the above-named places during the year, and there have not been any prosecutions for infringement of the By-laws. It is very difficult to get the keepers of small general shops to use any precautions to protect the milk from contamination, and I find it useless calling their attention to the danger. They seem to treat the matter as of no importance, and as official "busybodyism" if you do speak about it. Food and Drugs Act.—I have submitted 325 articles of food to the Public Analyst, of which 27 were adulterated. Legal Proceedings.—I have attended at the Police Courts 22 times in connection with my duties as Food Inspector. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Food Inspector. 123 To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and 1884. I submit herewith my Annual Report under the above Acts, 1877 and 1884. During the year ending 31st December, 1912, I made 64 inspections, and found the regulations carried out by the owners and occupiers. In no case lias it been necessary to serve notices. There has not come under my notice any cases of infectious disease or other illness, and all the requirements of the Acts have been fairly well observed. I am Sir, Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Cannl Boats Inspector. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year 1912. I made 613 visits to the market streets, 64 visits to premises where food is in course of preparation for sale, and took 100 samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. I made 88 visits to the licensed slaughter-houses, where I saw the following animals killed and dressed, viz.:— 164 Sheep 36 Bullocks. 2 Lambs. and re-examined the following:— 38 carcases of Mutton 7 „ Beef. 146 inspections of cowsheds, milkshops and dairies, were made. I bad the following food destroyed by fire at the Council's Dust Destructor:— 1 Ox liver. Flukes 1 „ Abscess 1 „ Flukes Fore quarter, lungs and head of an Ox. Tuberculous Head and tongue of a Heifer. „ 1 Ox liver Flukes 1 trunk of uncured Haddocks Decomposed 1 „ mixed Fish „ 1 am, Yours obediently, W. G. Auger, Food Inspector. 124 To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1912, as Inspector of Food and Food places. Markets.—I made 2,010 inspections of the various market places including butchers, pork butchers, fishmongers, and greengrocer's shops and stalls, and made applications when necessary to the magistrates sitting at the Police Courts to condemn and order to destroy certain unsound food. The following articles were removed and destroyed, being unfit for the food of man, in cases where the food was not seized it was removed at the request of the owners in writing under Sub-section 8 of section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— 5 tons 6 cwt. 2 qrs. of onions. ¾ cwt. of haddocks. 1 case of eggs. 3 pieces of mutton. 19 tins of condensed milk. 9 tins of tomatoes. 1 tin of apricots. 6 lbs. of cherries. Foodmakers.—I made 325 visits to the premises where sausages, tripe, &c.r are made and found the premises generally satisfactory, utensils clean, and the food sound. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—There are 4 slaughter-houses in my district, I made 237 inspections, and generally found the premises clean and kept in accordance with the bye-laws. During these visits I saw 441 sheep, 72 bullocks, 105 pigs, 50 lambs and calves killed and dressed, and such organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed and destroyed; the owners signed the unsound food form under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following table shows the number of animals and organs found to be diseased, nature of diseases, etc.:— No. Description of Carcase. Disease. Where affected. How disposed of. 1 Pig Tuberculosis Carcase and Organs Destroyed by burning at the Dust Destructor. 1 „ Abscess Liver „ „ 6 Oxen Flukes Livers „ „ 3 „ Abscess „ „ „ 2 „ Tuberculosis Lungs „ „ 1 Ox Abscess „ „ „ „ 2 Oxen Ecliinococcus Cysts „ „ „ 125 Licensed Cowsheds.—I paid 46 visits to the cowsheds and found them satisfactory, and the Byelaws generally observed. Milkshops.— I made 575 inspections of milkshops, and with few exceptions found the milk vessels clean, hut there are shops where milk ought not to be sold. During these visits I found 17 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—I obtained 325 samples of food and drugs, and submitted them to the Public Analyst for analysis under these Acts, 33 of which were adulterated, 17 being butters and 11 milks. Of the samples of milk 30 were taken promiscuously at the St. Pancras (51.R.), Kentish Town (M.R.), and King's Cross (Gr.N.ll.) Stations, and only one was found to be -adulterated, and that too small for prosecution, while 25 samples were taken at the request of the consignor, and 5 of them adulterated. Ice Cream Makers.—I made 161 inspections of ice cream makers' premises and barrows, and on 11 occasions found breaches of the by-laws as to dirty utensils, etc. In some cases the proprietors were cautioned by order of the Public Health Committee. During the year I attended before the Magistrates at the different Police Courts 47 times in the discharge of my duties. Harry R. Child, Inspector of Food and Food Places. 126 VI.—LEGISLATION. In the Annual Report for 1909, under Part IV.—Sanitation, § 1—Inspection, and paragraph "Staff" a list of General and Special Acts, Orders, By-laws and Regulations, passed since 1888 to 1909 inclusive, affecting Public Health, was given. § 1.—GENERAL ACTS. During the year no General Act of Parliament of Public Health or Sanitary importance became law. § 2 LOCAL ACTS. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1912, contained noprovisions affecting public health. § 3 ORDERS. On the 26th July, 1912, the Local Government Board issued an Order under section 16 (1) (b) of the National Insurance Act, prescribing the manner of domiciliary treatment of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis. On the 9th and 20th August, 1912, the Local Government Board made Orders for the admission of non-pauper cases of Whooping Cough and Puerperal Fever respectively into the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. § 4.-BY-LAWS. No new By-laws were made during the year. § 5.—REGULATIONS. Milk and Cream Regulation. — On the 6th August, 1912, a circular communication was received from the Local Government Board enclosing a copy of "The Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912." The regulations are designed to secure that no preservative shall be added to milk, or to cream containing less than 35 per cent. by weight of milk-fat, at any stage from the place of production to that of delivery to the purchaser. In the case of cream containing over 33 per cent. of milk-fat, the addition of boric acid, borax, or a mixture of these preservative substances, or of hydrogen peroxide, is not prohibited by the Regulations, but it is subject to a system of declaration which is required to be followed by all persons dealing with such cream for the purpose of sale for human consumption. By this system it is intended that, preserved ere nn as an article of commerce shall in all stages be differentiated from .cream to which no preservative has been added. The addition of any thickening substance to cream or preserved cream is also prohibited. 127 It is provided that before the local authority institute proceedings against any person for contravention of these Regulations, the authority shall afford him an opportunity of furnishing an explanation, and shall duly consider such explanation and all the circumstances of the case. Skimmed or Separated Milk.—On the 20th August, 1912, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries forwarded a copy of the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1912. These Regulations amend the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901, in so far as they relate to skimmed or separated milk, and replace the limit of 9 per cent, of total milk-solids, on which, under Article 3 of those Regulations, a presumption that the milk is not genuine is based, by a limit of 8.7 per cent. of milk-solids other than milk-fat. § 6. -LEGAL DECISIONS. KING'S BENCH DIVISION. (Before Lord Alverstone, C.J., Channell and Avory, J.J.) Spiers find Pond, Limited v. Green. 77 J.P. 11. Public Health—Milk—carrying on the trade of purveyor—Refreshment buffet—Occasional sales—Necessity for registration—Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885, Art. 6 (1). The appellants were summoned for carrying on the trade of a purveyor of milk without being registered as such in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885, as amended by subsequent Order of 1886. It was proved that the appellants were occupiers of a refreshment buffet at Farringdon Street Station, and sold there articles of food and drink, including milk. The sale of milk by the appellants was extremely small, amounting to about three or four glasses per week—the takings for milk being about 4d. (Ait of £50 a week, and no milk was sold for consumption off the premises. Held that the appellants were not carrying on "the trade of a purveyor of milk" within the meaning of the Order, and that, therefore, they did not require to be registered. KING'S BENCH DIVISION. Williams v. Friend. 107 L.T.R. 93. Upon a summons under Section 6 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1875, the appellant was convicted of unlawfully selling to the prejudice of the purchaser an article of food—to wit, cream—not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded by the purchaser. 128 The appellant was the proprietor of a shop, where he carried on the business of a dairyman. On the 27th June, 1911, one B., who was an assistant to the respondent, an inspector under the Food and Drugs Acts, went to the appellant's premises, and demanded and purchased half a pint of cream, for which he paid. Nothing was said by the appellant when the sale was made. Before he was supplied with the cream, the said B. saw and read a notice which was exhibited in a conspicous position in the appellant's shop, and which was to the effect that all cream sold at that establishment contained a small portion of boron preservative, not exceeding one-half of 1 per cent.. to keep it sweet and wholesome. The cream sold contained a smaller proportion of preservative than that specified in the notice. There was on medical or chemical evidence before the Justices beyond the certificate of the Public Analyst. It was contended that the sale of thecrcam was to the prejudice of the purchaser, and that the onus was upon the appellant to show the added preservative was not injurious to health. Held (allowing the appeal), that the sale was not to the prejudice of the purchaser. KING'S BENCH DIVISION. (Before Lord Alverstone, C.J.. Hamilton and Bankes, J.J.) Dairy Supply Company, Limited, (apps.) v. Houghton (resp.) 106 L. T. R. 220. Adulteration—Milk—False warranty—Reason to believe that statements therein were true—Power of Court to draw inferences of fact—Supreme Court of Judicature (Procedure) Act, 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 16), s. 2 — Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899 (62 & 63 Vict. c. 51), s. 20, sub-sect. 6. The appellants, who were wholesale dealers in milk purchased from farmers in the country, were summoned under sect. 20, sub-sect. 6, of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, for giving a false warranty in writing to a retail dealer named J., who purchased the milk from them. A sample of the milk sold by J. was found to be deficient in milk fat, and J. proved that he purchased it with a warranty from the appellants. The milk from which this sample was taken was supplied to the appellants under a warranty from the farmer who supplied it, and the particular consignment bore a ticket warranting the milk to be pure. No sample was taken by the appellants of this particular consignment. and nothing was done to it before it was sent to the dealer, but the appellants had from time to time taken samples of the milk sent by the particular farmer, who was a registered milk seller, and it was always found to be up to the standard. The appellants also took various precautions to insure that the milk supplied to them was pure, and upon the day in question they took samples of many consignments of milk, but none of the milk supplied by the particular farmer. On these facts the appellants were convicted for giving a false warranty to J., and this conviction was affirmed by the quarter sessions and a case stated. Held, that upon a case stated by the Court of Quarter Sessions the High Court has power under sect. 2 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Procedure) 129 Act, 1894, to draw any inferences of fact which might have been drawn by the Quarter Sessions, and that the proper inference to be drawn from the facts was that the appellants had proved that when they gave the warranty to J. they had reason to believe that the statements therein were true, and were therefore protected under sect. 20, sub-sect. 6, of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. KING'S BENCH DIVISION. (Before Lord Alverstone, C.J., Channell and Avory, J.J.) Ross v. Helm. 77 J. P. 13. Sale of food and drugs—Whiskey—Prejudice of purchaser—Purchase bv Inspector—Evidence of appointment—Necessity of proof of appointment —Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 (38 & 39 Vict. c. 63), s. 6. On an information by the appellant, an Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, against the respondent for selling to the prejudice of the appellant whiskey which was not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded, the appellant stated in evidence that he was an Inspector under the Food and Drugs Act. After the close of the case for the prosecution, it was objected that the appellant had not produced his appointment, and that it was necessary for him to prove that he was a duly authorised officer. The Justices upheld the objection and dismissed the information. Held, that the case must be remitted to the Justices to be heard and determined, per curiam on the ground that there was evidence before the Justices that the appellant was an inspector, and, per Channell and Avory, J.J., on the ground that it was not necessary for the appellant to prove that he was an inspector, as the prosecution was under s. 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. KING'S BENCH DIVISION. (Before Ridley, Lord Colekidge, and Phillimore, J.J.) Rex. Local Government Board; ex parte Arlidy. 77 J. P. 131. Housing and Town Planning—Closing Order—Refusal to determine—Appeal to Local Government Board—Right of appellant to be heard—Local Government Board Act, 1871 (34& 35 Vict. c. 70), s. 5— Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, c. 44), ss. 17 (6), 39 (1). By s. 17 (6) of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, if a local authority refuse to determine a closing order the owner may appeal to the Local Government Board, and by s. 39 (1) on any such appeal the Board may make such order in the matter as they think equitable. Held, that the Local Government Board are not bound, before determining an appeal, to hear the appellant personally. 130 CHANCERY DIVISION. (Before Swinfen Eady, J.) Adams v. Ursell. 108 L. T. R. 292. Nuisance—Fried Fish Shop—Injunction. The plaintiff in 1907 purchased H. House where he practised as a veterinary surgeon. The defendant entered into possession of the adjoining house in November, 1912, and started the business of selling fried fish there, which he cooked from 11.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m., and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., causing (it was alleged) a smell pervading every part of the plaintiff's house which was so unbearable he had to keep all his windows closed. The defendant alleged that he had the most up-to-date ranges. He lived in a manufacturing town and the premises were in the lowest part of the town and had been used as a pork butcher and bacon curer's shop. Held, applying the definition in Walter v. Selfe (4 De G. & Sm., at p. 322), that a common law nuisance had been proved which must be restrained by injunction till trial of the action. Gwynne v. Clarke. 77 J. P., 173. (Before His Honour Judge Johnston, K.C.) Local Government—Public Health—Infectious Disease—Pulmonary Consumption—Liability for infection—Lodger in Boarding-house—Warranty or misrepresentation. A person who, knowing that he is suffering from an infectious disease, succeeds in gaining admission as a lodger to the house of another person, by either falsely representing that he is not suffering from any infectious disease, or by warranting that he is not suffering from some particular infectious disease, renders himself liable in damages, the amount depending upon the actual loss which reasonably followed from the false representation or the breach of warranty. In a common law action the degree of infectiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis is one of fact in each particular case. A person suffering at the time from pulmonary tuberculosis came to a boarding-house to take lodgings. The landlady recpiired a statement as to whether he was suffering from tuberculosis, and she was assured by a friend of his in his presence that he was not, but was just recovering from congestion of the lungs. She made no further inquiries and was satisfied with that assurance. Held (following the principle laid down in Heilbut Symons & Co. v. Buckleton (1913) a.c.p. 64) that there was evidence of an intention on the part of the parties that there should be a contractual liability in respect of the accuracy of the statement and that the landlady was entitled to recover damages from the executor of the consumptive in respect of breach of warranty. 131 VII.- REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH.
