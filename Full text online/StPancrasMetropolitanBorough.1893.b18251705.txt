THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1893. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Thirty-eighth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of St. Pancras. Upon the front page will be found a map of the Parish of St. Pancras, showing the Registration Sub-Districts. This map will explain better than words the area comprised in each of the Sub Districts of the Registrars of Births, Deaths, and Marriages, and the statistics in this Report will be more readily understood, localised, and compared, with the assistance of the map. In the body of the Report, under the head of Water Supply, will be found certain points of the law, bye-laws, and regulations in reference to this subject, which is important, from the fact that it is generally accepted that, even if sporadic cases occur, Cholera can obtain no foothold where the water supply is pure, protected, and ample. The Clauses of the Acts defining drains, and especially combined drains, will be found quoted under drainage, so that the position of your Authority in dealing with this question may be evident. The progress in improving the condition of the Regent's Canal is reported in an epitomised form, with a prospect of its early completion. The immense improvement that has taken place in the removal of house refuse will be found, under that head, to be evident from the comparative figures for the past three years, and no doubt with the completion of the Dust Destructor in the King's Road a period of further improvement in removal and disposal will take place. As in previous years a table of the principal meteorological data is given overleaf. 8 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1893. Barometer. Temperature. Daily range of Temperature. Degree of Humidity. Rainfall.

The number of Births registered during the year was 6937, being 45 more than in the preceding year, and 461 less than the annual average during the preceding decennium. The 219 births occuring in Public Institutions having been re-distributed according to population, the number of births and the birth-rate of each of the Sub-Districts and of the District were as follows:— Sub-Districts.

It has been the custom to regard the mortality from the "principal zymotic diseases" as one of the criteria of the health conditions of a district. Another standard is now introduced in the form of the mortality from the "notifiable infectious diseases." The following table will enable the diseases included under the respective heads to be seen at a glance: — Notifiable Infectious Diseases. Small-Pox Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever Diphtheria or Membranous Croup Typhus Fever Typhoid or Enteric Fever Continued Fever Relapsing Fever Puerperal Fever Cholera Erysipelas Principal Zymotic Diseases. Small-Pox Scarlet Fever Diphtheria Typhus Fever Enteric Fever Continued Fever Measles Whooping Cough Diarrhœa Dysentery It will be noticed that the first six diseases, namely, Small-Pox, Scarlatina, Diphtheria or Membranous Croup, Typhus, Enteric, and Continued Fevers, are included under both heads. Relapsing and Puerperal Fevers, Cholera, and Erysipelas are notifiable infectious diseases not included amongst the principal zymotic diseases. Measles, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery are included amongst the principal zymotic diseases, but are not notifiable infectious diseases, at least in St. Pancras. Thus, by taking the deaths of the first six diseases, and adding either group of the succeeding four, the number of deaths and mortality of the one or of the other classification may be obtained. 13 At the end of the Report in Table VII c will be found set out the number of deaths under 5 years of age, and at 5 years upwards from each of the notifiable Infectious Diseases in the respective Registration Sub-Districts, and the entire District of St. Pancras. In Table VIII. in a similar manner the deaths from the non-notifiable "principal zymotic diseases" will bo found set out. From these two Tables the mortality of the respective diseases and each of the groups may be obtained. The Notifiable Infectious Dieeases.—The number of deaths from this group of diseases in the Sub-Districts, and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 55 1.5 72.3 Tottenham Court 48 1.8 83.2 Gray's Inn Lane 40 1.4 53.4 Somers Town 52 1.6 62.7 Camden Town 17 1.2 48.3 Kentish Town 171 1.8 90.2 St. Pancras 383 1.6 74.2 London 6695 1.6 73.1 The Principal Zymotic Diseases.—The number of deaths from this group of diseases in the Sub-Districts, and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths were as follows: — Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 117 3.1 153.8 Tottenham Court 82 2.2 142.1 Gray's Inn Lane 88 3.1 117.5 Somers Town 147 4.4 165.3 Camden Town 54 3.8 153.4 Kentish Town 285 2.9 150.4 St. Pancras 773 3.3 149.7 London 13233 3.1 144.6 14 Reference to Table V., at the and of the Report, shows that 9 deaths from small-pox were registered in St. Pancras during 1893, compared to 2 in 1892, and none in the three years previous to that. Scarlet Fever caused 101 deaths against 67 in the previous year, and 42.6 the annual average for the past ten years. Diphtheria mortality continues apparently to rise, 187 deaths being attributed to this cause, compared to 114 last year, and 73.2 the annual average of the past decennium. Typhus and continued fevers caused no deaths. Enteric fever caused 24 deaths, two less than in the previous year, and 21.2, or approaching one-half less than the decennial average. Measles was the cause of fewer deaths in the past year than in the previous year—namely, 149 as compared to 229, and a decennial average of 137.1. Whooping-cough also showed a fall from 147 in 1892 to 103 in 1893, the ten years' average having been 142.9. Diarrhoea and Dysentery, on the other hand, showed a rise, the deaths from these causes last year being 188, and the previous year 139 in number, with a decennial average of 177.7. Relapsing Fever caused no deaths. Puerperal Fever was the cause of 12 deaths, the same number as last year. Two deaths were attributed to Cholera, there having been none in the previous year, and 5 in 1891. Erysipelas caused 36 deaths, compared to 9 and 12 in the two preceding years. CERTAIN OTHER DISEASES. Phthisis.—This disease, as typical of the tubercular group of diseases, caused 458 deaths, compared to the same number in 1892, and 513 in 1891. The incidence of these diseases in the Sub-Districts was as follows: — Sub-Districts. Numbers. Per 1,000 Population. Per 1000 total Deaths.

UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. The number of uncertified deaths registered in St. Pancras was 14, nine more than in each of the two preceding years, in both of which the number was 5. INQUESTS.

During the past year, according to the preceding tables, Camden Town had the highest, and Regent's Park the lowest, birth-rate. Gray's Inn Lane the highest, and Kentish Town the lowest, death-rate at all ages. The infantile death rate was also highest in Gray's Inn Lane, followed by Somers Town, and lowest in Regent's Park, closely followed by Kentish Town. Somers Town appeared highest in deaths under five years of age, closely followed by Somers Town, whilst Kentish Town was lowest. The mortality from the 16 "notifiable infectious diseases" was highest in Kentish Town and Tottenham Court, and lowest in Camden Town; whereas the mortality from the "principal zymotic diseases" was highest in Camden Town, and lowest in Tottenham Court. The mortality figures of the latter group of diseases are about double those of the former, due to the addition of the essentially infantile complaints, measles, whooping cough, and diarrhoea. From phthisis the highest mortality prevailed in Camden Town, and the lowest in Tottenham Court; and from bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy, the highest was in Somers Town and Gray's Inn Lane, and the lowest in Regent's Park and Kentish Town. III.—INFECTIOUS DISEASES. NOTIFICATIONS. The number of cases of the Notifiable Infectious Diseases certified to your Medical Officer of Health during the year 1893, and the Sub-Districts in which they occurred, are shown in the following table: — Population—1891 Census.

The number of Scarlet Fever cases rose from 1279 to 2465, of Diphtheria from 432 to 732, of Small-Pox from 31 to 112, and of Enteric Fever from 119 to 163. Puerperal Fever, Continued Fever, and Cholera remained about stationary, Erysipelas increased from 426 to 678 cases, and Typhus and Relapsing Fever were altogether absent. In order to show the seasonal variation in the prevalence of the notifiable infectious diseases, the table appended has been compiled. It records the number of cases of each disease notified from week to week throughout the year. The total number is a few less than the number in the previous table due to the fact that certain further duplicate notifications have since been excluded. SAINT PANCRAS, LONDON.

(2) Power was given, should occasion arise, to make such compensation as may seem reasonable to the owner of any article infected by Cholera or by Choleraic Diarrhoea that may require to be destroyed. (3) Power was also given to send stools or portion of intestine in any doubtful case of Choleraic disease to a skilled Bacteriologist for examination. (4) Authority was given to communicate to Medical Practitioners in and adjoining the Parish as to the sending of stools or portion of intestine for examination, and to request them to notify Choleraic diseases, that is, Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhcea, and at the same time to forward to them a copy of the precautions prepared for the prevention of Cholera. (5) In case any Medical Attendant named on the list attended a suspected case of Cholera, he was to be paid a fee of 5s, it being understood that he would then direct the patient to the Parish Doctor, or to his regular Medical Attendant, if necessary. Scarlet Fever Milk Epidemic.—On the 1st November, I reported to your Health Committee, that on the 31st October, it came to my knowledge that eight cases of Scarlet Fever had arisen in the course of a week amongst customers of a certain milk vendor at Highgate. I was also informed that cases were occurring in Hornsey, the adjoining Parish. I proceeded to Hornsey, and had an interview with the Medical Officer of Health, who stated that he had had eleven cases of Soarlet Fever notified to him recently, who had obtained milk from Mr. Z , of Highgate, the same vendor as supplied the cases in Saint Pancras. I inspected the premises of Mr. Z., and the cows appeared to be in good health. He stated that the milk from his own cows supplied a quality of milk called "Nursery Milk," and that none of the names of those who had fallen ill with Scarlet Fever were supplied exclusively with this quality of milk. His ordinary milk he obtained from a farmer, Mr. Y, of Hendon. One of Mr. Y's milkmen was found on October 21st, to be suffering from Scarlatina, and was removed ou the 22nd to Hospital. In Hendon three cases of Scarlet Fever had occurred amongst the customers of two milkmen supplied by Mr. Y. Upon hearing this statement, I warned Mr. Z. not to supply milk in Saint Pancras from Mr. Y's farm at Hendon. I then proceeded to Hendon, to Mr. Y.'s farm. There I learned that the County Veterinary Inspector had been over to the farm, and had ordered five cows with sore teats and inflammatory symptoms to be isolated, and the milk from these cows to be stopped from sale. I informed Mr. Y. that I had warned Mr Z. of Highgate not to sell his milk in Saint Pancras, as it had evidently spread disease, whether due to the infected milkmen or infected cows I could not say, and I warned him not to send infected milk into Saint Pancras for the purpose of sale as human food. Your Committee instructed me to engage a Veterinary Surgeon and to take him with me to the Dairies mentioned. I ascertained that Professor Axe had been retained to act for Mr. Y., and I retained Professor Penberthy to act on behalf of the Vestry, In order to obtain a signature to the Order, I called 23 upon four Justices of the Peace in Saint Pancras, and found they were not available. I proceeded to Hendon with Professor Penberthy, and after calling upon five Magistrates and driving a great number of miles, I at last obtained a signature to the Order, and obtained admission to Mr. Y's farm. Professor Penberthy examined the animals. I ascertained from Mr. Y, that A, a milkman employed by him on the farm, on Tuesday morning, 17th October, at 6.30 a.m. went away ill, and that it had been since ascertained that he had Scarlet Fever. A lad B, fell ill on Sunday, the 22nd October, with Quinsy; he was not a cowman, but he had occasionally milked and worked on the farm. On Sunday, the 5th November, I called on several London Magistrates, and finally obtained a signature to the Order to enter Mr. L.'s Dairy, at Highgate, and took with me Professor Penberthy. He then had 12 cows, four of which had come in since the 30th October. The produce of these cows he delivered as " Nursery Milk," and the surplus was mixed with the other supply. He again stated (and I had no evidence to the contrary), that amongst those customers who were exclusively supplied with " Nursery Milk," no Scarlet Fever had occurred. In reference to the distribution of milk in Highgate, I learnt that Mr. Z. had three sources of supply; (1) from his own cows, (2) from Finsbury Park, (3) from Hendon. (1) His own cows supplied him with Nursery Milk, and the surplus was added to the Ordinary Milk. Six customers and their families were supplied with Nursery Milk exclusively, no ordinary milk being delivered to them. No case of Scarlet Fever occurred in the families of these customers. (2) The milk from Finsbury Park was distributed in the afternoon on two rounds only ; on the third round none of this milk was delivered, so that the third round never received any of this milk. In the two rounds to which the milk was delivered there are 191 customers, and there were eight cases of Scarlet Fever amongst these customers, or 4.2 per cent. (3) The milk from Hendon was delivered in all three "rounds" in the morning; that is, to all the customers served with ordinary milk, but in the afternoon was only delivered on one round, called the "street round," the other two rounds being supplied with the Finsbury Park milk. In this particular round, called the "street round," there were exactly 100 customers, and there were 20 cases of Scarlet Fever amongst these customers, that is 20 per cent. So that out of a total of 28 cases amongst Z.'s customers, 20 or 71.4 per cent. of the cases occurred in this round, to which the ordinary milk from Hendon was delivered, and from which the Finsbury Park milk was altogether excluded. Mr. Z. had a certificate from the Veterinary Surgeon of the London County Council, to the effect that all his cows were in perfect health. The above analysis showed, firstly, that the "Nursery Milk" from Z.'s own cows was not the cause of the spread of the disease, because no case occurred amongst those customers exclusively receiving it; secondly, that the Finsbury Park milk was not the cause of the spread of the disease, because in the round from which it was altogether excluded, the disease was spread nevertheless ; in fact, five-sevenths of the cases occurred in this round, therefore taking these facts in conjunction with the events at Hendon, I was of opinion that the milk delivered from Y's. farm at Hendon was spreading infectious disease in Highgate. 24 Pursuant to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, notices were duly served on the Dairyman (Z.), and on the Farmer (Y.) to appear before your Committee to shew cause why Orders should not be made by the Sanitary Authority requiring them not to supply any milk from the Dairy and Farm referred to within the district of Saint Pancras, until the withdrawal of such orders by the Sanitary Authority. On the consideration of the subject Professor Penberthy and Mr. Yillar, the Veterinary Surgeon for the Couuty of Middlesex, were present with your Committee. The Dairyman and Farmer attended, and failed to show why Orders should not be made against them, but on the contrary consenting to such Orders, your Committee made prohibition orders against Z. and Y. in accordance with Section 71 of the Act referred to. ISOLATION. The cases of Notifiable Infectious Diseases removed to hospital and the SubDistricts whence they were removed, are recorded in the following table:— Diseases. Regent's Park.

During the last three years the number of cases of the principal diseases removed, have been :— 1891 1892 1893 Small-Pox 1 31 95 Diphtheria 61 252 289 Scarlatina 426 811 885 Typhoid 92 56 71 Total (of three last) 579 1119 1245 25 But although this increase in the actual number of cases removed has been taking the number of cases notified has increased still more greatly, so that the proportion of cases removed to the number notified has been diminishing, as shown by the percentage figures:— Number of cases removed of every 100 cases notified. 1891 1892 1893 Small-Pox 100 100 85 Diphtheria 21 58 39 Scarlatina 69 63 36 Typhoid 47 43 Total (of three last) 51 60 37 During the last three years the total annual admissions from all London to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board has been 7,873, 16,624, and 21,129 respectively, compelling the Managers to provide additional accommodation. This accommodation has been provided by the erection of temporary hospital structures at Tottenham and at Lower Tooting. Sites for hospitals have also been sanctioned by the Local Government Board at Hither Green and Shooter's Hill, whilst the re-construction of portions of several existing hospitals—such as Hampstead, Fulham, and Deptford is being proceeded with, and an increase of the permanent accommodation at the Gore Farm Small-Pox Hospital is also being carried out. In my Annual Report for 1891, in recording an outbreak of Scarlet Fever, I commented adversely upon the situation of the sick wards at the Orphan Working School, and expressed the opinion that every large school should provide a separate isolated building for sick children, and that infirmary wards on the topmost floor of the building are not satisfactorily situated for many reasons. I regret to say that the condition remains the same. In a Special Report upon Enteric Fever in the same year, I also commented upon the sick wards at the Foundling Hospital, which were also situated at the top of the building, and again expressed the opinion that the infirmaries of all public institutions should be isolated buildings. In this instance I am happy to say that the Governors of the Foundling Hospital have constructed a convenient isolated infirmary in the grounds of the Institution. VACCINATION.

The number of articles disinfected in the steam chamber was 38,793, an increase of 17,417 on the previous year, and the number destroyed by fire in the destruction chamber was 1,964, an increase of 1,352. In 90 instances the fumigation and storing were done during the night— 55 before midnight and 35 after. Tn 52 instances the stripping and cleansing were done under the direction and at the expense of the Vestry. In stripping walls it is frequently necessary to remove a whole series of papers that have been hung one over the other. DETAILS OF DISINFECTION.

This has been rendered necessary on account of the inability of two Vans, one for infected, and the other for disinfected articles, to cope with the transport of articles during the busiest time of the year, and this van will also be ready upon emergency to replace either of the other two in case of disablement. The van is built to carry one ton, weighs 13 cwt. 3 qrs., has a capacity of 202 cubic feet, and is constructed of a special shape, resembling a furniture van, with a capacious well at the rear end. 29 Family Shelter.—During the year the Family Shelter at the Disinfecting Station was in course of erection, and as it was fully described and illustrated in the Annual Report for 1892, reference may be made to that Report for details. IV.—SANITATIO N . GENERAL WORK OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. In October last I made a Report to your Health Committee upon this subject, which was presented to your Vestry 20th December, 1893. The staff of the Department then consisted of 19 permanent officers, or practically of 20, for the temporary Clerk has been temporarily engagel now about two years, and his services cannot possibly be dispensed with, In addition three temporary Sanitary Inspectors were engaged during the third quarter of the year, and a temporary Special Inspector was appointed for three months to survey the houses in that portion of the Somers Town area north of Drummond Street. Certain figures appeared in the Report, and are reproduced now as being of permanent interest, especially as the fourth quarter of 1893 has since been added to complete the triennium.

During the same [period the following number of inspection of premises, &c., were made :— 1891. 1892. 1893. Inspections. Re-inspections Dust. Inspections. Re-inspections Dust. Inspections.

It is interesting to compare the amount of work done at the commencement of the sanitary era with the amount done at the present day. 1856-7 1893.

DWELLINGS. House to Home Inspections.—The number of streets inspected from house to house during the year was 18, consisting of 701 houses, of which 651 were occupied, and 55 unoccupied and passed over; the inspected houses contained 4462 rooms, of which 4284 were occupied and 178 unoccupied, by 1793 separate families, consisting of 3823 adults and 1796 children (Table II). Houses Occupied in Separate Dwellings.—A list of blocks of houses constructed in separate and self-contained dwellings in St. Pancras will be found among the Reference Lists at the end of the Report. The number of houses occupied in separate dwellings, which are not self-contained is very large and is unknown. Registered tenement houses.—The number of houses occupied in separate dwellings or " let in lodgings to members of more than one family," that are registered under the bye-laws in force is 164. These houses were re-inspected in the autumn by the Temporary Sanitary Inspectors, and such notices were served as were necessary to place them in conformity with the bye-laws. Registered common lodging-houses.—The supervision of these houses is about to be handed over from the Metropolitan Police to the London County Council, when no doubt a new and improved code of Bye-laws will be framed. Underground dwellings. —The number of underground rooms closed against occupation as separate dwellings during the year was 53. Canal boats used as dwellings.—The following Canal Boats were inspected during the year with the results quoted:— Name or Number of Boat. Place of Registration. Registered No. Condition. Remarks.

In July, 1888, the dwellings over the stables in Fortess Mews were represented under the Artizans Dwellings Act, 1868, as unfit for human habitation, and the Chief Surveyor having recommended demolition, the owner closed the mews. Recently certain of these dwellings were found to be re-occupied. Your Vestry thereupon resolved that, provided the owner give an undertaking not to use any part of such Mews for human habitation, no objection will be made to the use by him of the Mews as stables and coach-houses provided always that any repairs necessary are executed in such a manner as to prevent any nuisance, and to fit them properly to such uses, and that they continue to be maintained in a sanitary condition. 34 UNHEALTHY AREAS. As stated in my Annual Report for 1891, the enquiry into the Insanitary Areas, commenced by the Arbitrator, on behalf of the Home Secretary, on 23rd of October of that year was adjourned. The enquiry was resumed in February, 1893, and occupied further four days. Upon the Report of the Arbitrator your Yestry received the following letter, conveying the award of the Home Secretary :— Whitehall, 27th June, 1893. Sir, "With reference to the letter from this Department of the 3rd September, 1891, notifying that, in compliance with an application of the Vestry, as the Local Authority for the Parish of St. Pancras, made under Section 73 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, in consequence of a resolution of the London County Council, that the case of certain insanitary areas in that Parish- viz., (1) Somers Town Churchway and Weir's Passage ; (2) Prospect Terrace, and Derry Street; (3) Brantome Place and North Crescent Mews was not of general importance to the County of London, and should be dealt with under Tart II. of that Act; the Secretary of State had appointed an Arbitrator to hold a Local Inquiry, and to report in the manner indicated in the said Section 73, I am directed by the Secretary of State to acquaint you, for the information of the St. Pancras Vestry, that having received the report of the said Arbitrator; and, having considered the same, the Secretary of State, in pursuance of the said Act and Section, makes award as to the matters referred to in the said application as follows:— As to Area No. 1 Somers Town. (a) That so much that lies to the west of Chalton Street, but South of Drummond Street, excluding Christopher Place, should be dealt with by the London County Council, under Part I. of the Act. (b) That Christopher Place, and so much as lies to the west of Chalton Street, but north of Drummond Street, should be dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. of the Act, without any contribution from the County Council. (c) That so much as lies to the east of Chalton Street should be dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. of the Act, the County Council contributing one-third of the expense. As to Area No. 2, Prospect Terrace and Derry Street. As to Area No. 3, Brantome Place. That these Areas should be dealt with by the Vestry under Part II. of the Act, the County Council contributing one-half of the expense. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Godfrey Lushington. 35 The plans of the several areas having been published in the Annual Report for 1891, it is unnecessary to reproduce them here. With reference to the area to be dealt with by the County Council, under Part I. of the Act, in accordance with advice of Counsel, I made a new representation to the County Council to deal with this area. The following is a copy of the representation so made, viz.:— Health Department, Vestry Hall, St. Pancras, 22nd July, 1893. Housing of the Working Clams Act, 1890, London (Churehway, St. Pancras) Improvement, 1893. To The London County Council, Take Notice that pursuant to Section 4 of 53 and 54 Victoria, 1890, Chapter 70, above named, I do hereby make an Official Representation to you, the above-named London County Council, that in the Parish of Saint Pancras, and in the district of Somers Town, in that Parish, and within the area, bounded by Seymour Street, Drummond Street, Chalton Street, and Euston Road, excluding Christopher Place, which area is delineated and coloured pink on the plan hereunto annexed, and signed by me to the effect following, that is to say : — 1.—That houses, courts, or alleys within the said area are unfit for human habitation, and — 2.—That streets and houses or groups of houses within the said area, from their narrowness, closeness, bad arrangement, and bad condition, and the want of light, air, ventilation, proper conveniences, and other sanitary defects, are dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants within the said area, and of the neighbouring buildings. These evils and sanitary defects cannot be effectively remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and reconstruction of the streets and houses within this area, or some of them. John F. J. Sykes, D.Sc., M.D., Medical Officer of Health of the Parish of St. Pancras, in the County of London. With regard to the area north o f Drummond Street, and west of Chalton Street, which, on sanitary grounds, was the least objectionable of the separate areas, as divided by the Home Secretary's award, and in respect of which area the Vestry were required to carry out any necessary amendments without a contribution from the County Council, your Vestry found that it was not necessary to prepare any scheme, but decided to appoint a temporary Inspector for three months to make a house-to-house inspection and report thereon, with the view to taking any necessary action to cause the individual houses in this area to be put into proper sanitary condition. 36 With regard to the other areas, your Vestry passed the following resolutions on 26th July, 1893 :— Somers Town Area, East of Chalton Street. Blocks 1 and 2. 1.—That the "closeness, narrowness, bad arrangement, and bad condition of the buildings within the area bounded by Chalton Street, Chapel Street, Ossulston Street, and Euston Road, being Block I., and also within the area bounded by Chalton Street, Chapel Street, Ossulston Street, and Phoenix Street, being Block II., and the want of light, air, ventilation, proper convenience and other sanitary defects in the said buildings is dangerous and prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, both of the buildings within the said area, and of the neighbouring buildings. 2.—That the demolition or the re-construction, or re-arrangement of the said buildings or some of them is necessary to remedy the said evils. 3.—That the said area, and the sites thereof are too small to be dealt with as unhealthy areas under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 4.— That Mr. Keith Downes Young, of 17, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, be directed to prepare a scheme for the improvement of the said area, and submit it to the Health Committee for consideration and report to the Vestry at the earliest possible date; and that Mr. Young be requested to consider, in preparing the said scheme, whether the two blocks can better be dealt with in oDe scheme, and to prepare a report accordingly. Brantome Place. 1.—That the closeness, narrowness, bad arrangement, and bad condition of the buildings within the area bounded by Burton Crescent, Crescent Place, Burton Street, and Mabledon Place, known as the Brantome Place area, and the want of light, air, ventilation, proper conveniences, and other sanitary defects, in the said buildings is dangerous and prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, both of the buildings within the said area and of the neighbouring buildings. 2.—That the demolition or the re-construction or re-arrangement of the said buildings, or of some of them, is necessary to remedy the said evils. 3.—That the said area and the site thereof is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy area under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 4.—That Mr. Keith Downes Young, of 17, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, be directed to prepare a scheme for the improvement of this area, and submit it to the Health Committee for consideration, and report to the Vestry at the earliest possible date. Prospect Terrace. 1.—That the closeness, narrowness, bad arrangement, and bad condition of the buildings within the area bounded by Wellington Place, Prospect Terrace, and Sidmouth Street, known as the Prospect Terrace area, and the want of light, air, ventilation, proper conveniences, and other sanitary defects in the said buildings, are dangerous and prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants, both of the buildings within the said area and of the neighbouring buildings. 37 2.—That the demolition or re-construction, or the re-arrangement of the said buildings or some of them, is necessary to remedy the said evils. 3.— That the said area and the site thereof is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy area under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 4.—That Mr. Keith Downes Young, of 17, Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, be directed to prepare a scheme for the improvement of the said area, and submit it to the Health Committee for consideration, and report to the Vestry at the earliest possible date. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. In the Annual Report for 1891, I recited the sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, referring to factories, workshops, and work-places, and the powers and duties of Sanitary Authorities in regard to them. Iu the Annual Report fcr 1892, I recited the Order of the Home Secretary in reference to lists of outworkers in certain trades. When a complaint has been made in reference to any factory, workshop, or work-place, it has been punctually attended to, and any nuisance, defect, or infringement promptly remedied. Any attempt to systematically inspect all work-places in St. Pancras—from premises to premises, upon the principle of house-to-house inspection, would require, if the inspections were made twice a-year, a very large increase in the staff of your Inspectors. House to house inspection is of more importance than inspection from work-place to workplace. Bakehouses. The bakehouses have been systematically inspected twice in the year, and notices served where necessary. In order to obtain a complete record of the condition of the bakehouses, it will be necessary to obtain information upon all the following points: — Address. Name of occupier; if vacant, date when closed. Distance of the floor of the bakehouse above or below ground level. Height of bakehouse. Width. Length. Deductions for fittings and furniture. Cubic capacity of' bakehouse. Position of the ashbin with regard to the bakehouse. Position of the urinal (or place used for this purpose) and sink with regard to the bakehouse. Position of the W.C. with regard to the bakehouse. If the draw-taps be not on the main, the situation and cleanliness of the cistern. Disconnection of the W.C. water supply from the cistern, if supplying draw-taps. Number and situation of any drain-openings within the bakehouse, Flooding or back flow from any drain-openings within the bakehouse, and the dates of occurrence. 38 The condition of the flooring as to lodgment of refuse, soakage, and the rising of ground air. (A hard, smooth, impervious flooring, extending under the trough.) Condition of the lower part of the walls as to dampness. (Impervious surface, dry area, damp-course, &c.) Number, size, and situation of the ventilating openings (Fanlights, windows, doors, &c., especially as to the admission of dust and dirt). Size of open yard, and size of opening above area Situation and condition of the places, stores, or rooms for flour, butter, &c. The kind of baking that takes place (e.g , bread, pastry, &c.)., and the hours when carried on. Number of occupants of bakehouse when in full work Whether the bakehouse is used for any other purpose, and for what. Condition and cleanliness of fittings and utensils. Condition and cleanliness of floor, especially under troughs. Condition and cleanliness of walls, ceiling, and woodwork. Any further observations. It is to be observed that in addition to the objections attending underground bakehouses, they lead to the production of further evils by the enclosure of the cellars, yards, and areas, causing obstruction to ventilation, and leading to the placing of drain-openings in bakehouses, from inability to place them elsewhere. Laundries. The principal points of attention in laundries, in addition to the present one of overcrowding, are paving, levelling, and draining, to minimise the dampness; ventilation, especially for the outlet of steam and heat; and the exclusion of infection, whether conveyed directly or indirectly. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The Health Committee, as Sanitary Authority, having authorised the Medical Officer of Health to grant the certificates now required under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that new houses have a proper and sufficient supply of water, in order to understand the requirements at present in force, the Sections of the Act, together with the Regulations and Bye-laws, are here quoted. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. Section 48 (1) An occupied house without a proper and sufficient supply of water shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act, and, if it is a dwelling-house, shall be deemed unfit for human habitation. (2) A house which after the commencement of this Act is newly erected, or is pulled down to or below the ground floor and rebuilt, shall not be occupied as a dwelling house until the Sanitary Authority have certified that it has a proper and sufficient supply of water, either from a water company or by some other means. (3) If the Sanitary Authority refuse such Certificate, or fail to give it within one month after written request for the same from the owner of the house, the owner of the house may apply to a petty sessional court, and that court after 39 hearing or giving the Sanitary Authority an opportunity to be heard may, if they think the certificate ought to have been granted, make an order authorising the occupation of the house; but, unless such order is made, an owner who occupies or permits to be occupied, the house as a dwelling-house without such certificate, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds, and to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which it is so occupied, until a proper and sufficient supply of water is provided; but the imposition of such fine shall be without prejudice to any proceedings for obtaining a closing order. Section 2 (1) For the purposes of this Act— (f) Any such absence from premises of water fittings as is a nuisance by virtue of Section 33 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, set out in the First Schedule of this Act. Section 4 (3) Provided that— (d) Where the nuisance is such absence of water fittings as is declared a nuisance by Section 33 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, (set out in the first Schedule of this Act), such absence shall be deemed to render the premises unfit for human habitation unless and until the contrary is shown to the satisfaction of the Court. Schedule 1.—Section 33 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871.—Absence of proper water fittings in premises to be a nuisance. The absence in respect of any premises of the prescribed fittings after the prescribed time shall be a nuisance within Section 11 and Sections 12—19 (inclusive) of the Nuisances Removal Act for England, 1855, and within all provisions of the same or any other Act applying, amending, or otherwise relating to those sections, and that nuisance, if in any case proved to exist, shall be presumed to be such as to render the premises unfit for human habitation within Section 13 of the Nuisances Removal Act for England, 1855, unless and until the contrary is shown to the satisfaction of the Justices acting under that Section. Regulations made under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871. Reg. 1.—No "communication pipe" for the conveyance of water from the waterworks of the Company into any premises shall hereafter be laid until after the point or place at which such "communication pipe" is proposed to be brought into such premises shall have had the approval of the Company. 2.—No lead pipe shall hereafter be laid or fixed in or about any premises for the conveyance of or in connexion with the water supplied by the Company (except when and as otherwise authorised by these regulations, or by the Company), unless the same shall be of equal thickness throughout, and of at least the weight following, that is to say — Internal Diameter of pipe in inches. 3/8 inch diameter. ½ ,, ,, 5/8 ,, ,, ¾ ,, ,, 1¼ ,, ,, Weight of Pipe in lbs. per lineal yard. 5 lbs. per lineal yard. 6 7½ „ „ 9 12 16 40 3.—Every pipe hereafter laid or fixed in the interior of any dwellinghouse for the conveyance of, or in connexion with, the water of the Company, must, unless with the consent of the Company, if in contact with the ground, be of lead, but may otherwise be of lead, copper, or wrought iron, at the option of the consumer. 4.—No house shall, unless with the permission of the Company in writing, be hereafter fitted with more than one " communication pipe." 5.—Every house supplied with water by the Company (except in cases of stand-pipes) shall have its own separate " communication pipe."

The connexion of every "communication pipe" with the pipes of the Company shall be made by the Company's workmen, and the Company shall be paid in advance the reasonable costs and charges of and incident to the making of such connexion. 8.—Every " communication pipe "and every pipe external to the house and through the external walls thereof, hereafter respectively laid or fixed, in connexion with the water of the Company, shall be of lead, and every joint thereof shall be of the kind called a " plumbing " or " wiped " joint. 9.—No pipe shall be used for the conveyance of, or in connexion with, water supplied by the Company, which is laid or fixed through, in, or into any drain, ashpit, sink, or manure-hole, or through, in, or into any place where the water conveyed through such pipe may be liable to become fouled, except where such drain, ashpit, sink, or manure-hole, or other such place shall be in the unavoidable course of such pipe, and then in every such case such pipe shall be passed through an exterior cast-iron pipe or jacket of sufficient length and strength, and of such construction as to afford due protection to the water-pipe. 10.—Every pipe hereafter laid for the conveyance of, or in connexion with water supplied by the Company, shall when laid in open ground, be laid at least two feet six inches below the surface, and shall in every exposed situation be properly protected against the effects of frost. 11.—No pipe for the conveyance of, or in connexion with, water supplied by the Company, shall communicate with any cistern, butt, or other receptacle used or intended to be used for rain water. 12 —Every "communication pipe" for the conveyance of water to be supplied by the Company into any premises shall have at or near its point of entrance into such premises, and if desired by the consumer within such 41 premises, a sound and suitable stop-valve of the screw-down kind, with an area of waterway not less than that of a half inch pipe, and not greater than that of the " communication pipe," the size of the valve within these limits being at the option of the consumer. If placed in the ground such "stop valve" shall be protected by a proper cover and " guard-box." 13. Every cistern used in connexion with the water supplied by the Company shall be made and at all times maintained water-tight, and be properly covered and placed in such a position that it may be inspected and cleansed. Every such existing cistern, if not already provided with an efficient " balltap," and every such future cistern shall be provided with a sound and suitable "ball-tap" of the valve kind for the inlet of water. 14.

And the position of such "warningpipe" shall not be changed without previous notice to and approved by the Company. 16. No cistern buried or excavated in the ground shall be used for the storage or reception of water supplied by the Company, unless the use of such cistern shall be allowed in writing by the Company. 17.

Every watercloset-cistern or watercloset-servicebox hereafter fitted or fixed in which water supplied by the Company is to be used shall have an efficient waste-preventing apparatus, so constructed as not to be capable of discharging more than two gallons of water at each flush. 42 22. Every urinal-cistern in which water supplied by the Company is used, other than public urinal-cisterns, or cisterns having attached to them a selfclosing apparatus, shall have an efficient "waste-preventing" apparatus, so constructed as not to be capable of discharging more than two gallons of water at each flush. 2 i. Every " down-pipe " hereafter fixed for the discharge of water into the pan or basin of any watercloset shall have an internal diameter of not less than one inch and a-quarter, and if of lead shall weigh not less than nine pounds to every lineal yard. 2i. No pipe by which water is supplied by the Company to any watercloset shall communicate with any part of such closet, or with any apparatus connected therewith, except the service-cistern thereof 25.

BYE-LAWS. Made by the London County Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 39 (1.) With respect to waterclosets, eat thclosets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. * • * 3.—Every person who shall construct a watercloset in connection with a building shall furnish such watercloset with a cistern of adequate capacity for the purpose of flushing which shall be separate and distinct from any cistern used for drinking purposes, and shall be so constructed, fitted, and placed as to admit of the supply of water for use in such watercloset so that there shall not be any direct connection between any service pipe upon the premises and any part of the apparatus of such watercloset other than such flushing cistern. Provided always that the foregoing requirement shall be deemed to be complied with in any case where the apparatus of a watercloset is connected for the purpose of flushing with a cistern of adequate capacity, which is used solely for flushing waterclosets or urinals. » * * Bye-Laws. Made bv the Vestry of the Parish of St. Pancras, in the County of London, being the Sanitary Authority for the said Parish, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 39 (2). For Securing the Cleanliness and freedom from Pollution of Tanks, Cisterns, and other Receptacles used for storing of Wattr used, or likely to be used, by Man for Drinking or Domestic Purposes, or for manufacturing Brink for the use of Man. Interpretation of Terms. 1. — Throughout these bye-laws the expression, "the Sanitary Authority," means the Vestry of the Parish of St. Pancras, in the County of London. 2.—The owner of any premises who shall provide thereon a tank, cistern, or other rcceptacle to be used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall cause the same to be so constructed and placed that it may conveniently be cleansed. 44 3.—The owner of any premises on which a tank, cistern, or other receptacle not provided by the occupier of such premises is used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall cause every such tank, cistern, or other receptacle which is erected outside a building, or which being; erected inside a building is not placed in a suitable chamber, or otherwi-e constructed or placed so as to prevent the pollution of the water therein, to be provided with a proper cover. 4.—The occupier of any premises on which a tank, cistern, or other receptacle is used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, shall empty and cleanse the same, or cause the same to be emptied and cleaus.d, once at least in every six months, and at such other times as may be necessary to keep the same in a cleanly state and free from pollution. He shall cause every such tank, cistern, or other receptacle which is erected outside a building, or which, being erected inside a building, is not placed in a suitable chamber, or otherwise constructed or placed so as to prevent the pollution of the water therein, to be kept at all times properly covered. Provided that in every case where any tank, cistern, or other receptacle used for storing of water used, or likely to be used, by man for drinking or domestic purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man, is used for supplying water to persons occupying two or more separately occupied premises, the foregoing requirements shall apply to the owner of such premises instead of to any occupier thereof. The person in occupation of, or having the charge, management, or control of the premises; or, if there is no such person, then any person in occupation of or having the charge, management, or control of anv part of the premises, and in the case of any premises, the whole of which is let to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the lodgers, either on his own account, or as the agent of another person, shall, for the purposes of this bye law be deemed to be the occupier. 5.—The occupier of any premises or any other person shall not obstruct or interfere with the owner of such premises, or with any person duly authorised by him in that behalf, in the execution of any work to which the foregoing bye-laws relate. Penalties. 6.—Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority. Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law. 45 The capacity of watercloset flushing cisterns has been a subject of consideration not only in St. Pancras but throughout the metropolis. Clause 21 of the Regulations made under the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, runs— " Every watercloset-cistern or watercloset service box hereafter fitted or fixed in which water supplied by the Company is to be used shall have an efficient waste-preventing apparatus, so constructed as not to be capable of discharging more than two gallons of water at each flush." The Regulation provides only for a maximum. The experience of London Sanitary Authorities and the experiments of the Sanitary Institute justify the conclusion that this maximum is not even a sufficient minimum. Your Yestry passed a resolution that the Regulation be amended to read, " so constructed as to be capable of discharging not less than three gallons nor more than three and a half gallons at each flush." It appears that there would be little difficulty in altering the maximum flush from two gallons to two gallons and a half, if the water companies did not oppose it. But us the Regulations are not made for sanitary purposes but in order to prevent waste of water, it also appears that there is some hesitation in inserting a minimum flush even if the water companies would agree to this course. It has been proposed to overcome this objection by a bye-law fixing the minimum flush, the bye-law to be inserted either in the County Council's byelaws, "with respect to water closets, etc.," or better still, in the Vestry's byelaws, "with respect to the keeping of waterclosets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action." I would recommend your Vestry to so amend the bye:law as soon as it is opportune. In the meanwhile, nothing can be done so long as the way is blocked by the present maximum limit of two gallons in Regulation 21. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Combined drainage. — As this is a question of some difficulty it is desirable to set out the sections of the Acts bearing upon the subject. In order to make the matter clear it is also desirable to quote the definition of "a drain" and of "a sewer." The rulings under the Public Health Act, 1875, are often quoted to support the action of owners in the metropolis, but this Act does not apply to London, and as will be seen the law in the metropolis materially differs from that prevailing in the provinces. Public Health Act, 1875. Section 4.— "Drain" means any drain of and used for the drainage of one building only, or premises within the same curtilage, and made merely for the purpose of communicating therefrom with a cesspool or other like receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into which the drainage of two or more buildings or premises occupied by different persons is conveyed. 46 "Sewer" includes sewers and drains of every description, except drains to which the word "drain" interpreted as aforesaid applies, and except drains vested in or under the control of any authority having the management of roads and not being a local authority under this Act. It is clear from this that what is termed in London a combined drain is a sewer when situated outside the Metropolis. Section 41.—On the written application of any person to a local authority, stating that any drain, watercloset, earthcloset, privy, ashpit, or cesspool on or belonging to any premises within their district is a nuisance or injurious to health (but not otherwise), the local authority may, by writing, empower their surveyor or inspector of nuisances, after twenty-four hours' written notice to the occupier of such premises, or in case of emergency without notice, to enter such premises, with or without assistants, and cause the ground to be opened, and examine such drain, watercloset, earthcloset, privy, ashpit or cesspool. If the drain, watercloset, earthcloset, privy, ashpit or cesspool on examination is found to be in proper condition, he shall cause the ground to be closed, and any damage done to be made good as soon as can be, and expenses of the works shall be defrayed by the local authority. If the drain, watercloset, earthcloset, privy, ashpit or cesspool on examination appear to be in bad condition, or to require alteration or amendment, the local authority shall forthwith cause notice in writing to be given to the owner or occupier of the premises requiring him forthwith or within a reasonable time therein specified to do the necessary works, and if such notice is not complied with, the person to whom it is given shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten shillings for every day during which he continues to make default, and the local authority may, if they think fit, execute such works, and may recover in a summary manner from the owner the expenses incurred by them in so doing, or may by order declare the same to be private improvement expenses. Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890. Section 19.—(1) Where two or more houses belonging to different owners are connected with a public sewer by a single private drain, an application may be made under Section forty-one of the Public Health Act, 1875, (relating to complaints as to nuisance from drains), and the local authority may recover any expenses incurred by them in executing any works under the powers conferred on them by that Section, by the owners of the houses in such shares and proportions as shall be settled by their surveyor or (in case of dispute) by a court of summary jurisdiction. (2) Such expenses may be recovered summarily or may be declared by the urban authority to be private improvement expenses under the Public Health Acts, and may be recovered accordingly. (3) For the purposes of this section the expression " drain " includes a drain used for the drainage of more than one building. The Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, is not a compulsory but an adoptive Act, and any Sanitary Authority outside London adopting this Act modifies the definition of the word "drain" as defined in the principal Act before quoted. It will be observed that for the first time we here have mentioned a "public sewer," and a" private drain." Is the inference that it may be possible to have a private sewer, and. public drain ? It will also be observed that there is no mention of combined drainage in the sense conveyed by the Acts governing the metropolis as will be seen by the following sections— 47 Metropolis Local Management Ad, 1855. Sec. 250 * * * * * * The word " drain " shall mean and include any drain of and used for the drainage of one building only, or premises within the same curtilage, and made merely for the purpose of communicating with a cesspool or other like receptacle for drainage, or with a sewer into which the drainage of two or more buildings or premises occupied by different persons is conveyed, and shall also include any drain for draining anv group or block of houses by a combined operation under the order of any vestry or district board ; and the word " sewer " shall mean and include sewers and drains of every description, except drains to which the word " drain " interpreted ar; aforesaid, applies. Sec 73.—If any house or building whether built before or after the commencement of this Act, situate witliiu any such parish or district, be found not to be drained by a sufficient drain communicating with some sewer, and emptying itself into the same, to the satisfaction of the vestry or board of such parish or district, and ii a sewer of sufficient size be within one hundred feet of any part of such house or building, on a lower level than such house or building, it shall be lawful for the vestry or board at their discretion, by notice in writing to require the owner of such house or building forthwith or within such reasonable time as may be appointed by the vestry or board, to construct and make from such house or building into any such sewer a covered drain, and such branches thereto, of such materials, of such size, at such level, and with such fall as shall be adequate for the drainage of such house or building, and its several floors or storeys, and also of its areas, waterclosets, privies, and offices (if any), and for conveying the soil, drainage, and wash therefrom into the said sewer, and to provide fit and proper paved or impermeable sloped surfaces for conveying surface water thereto, and fit and proper sinks, and fit and proper syphoned or otherwise trapped inlets and outlets for hindering stench therefrom, and fit and proper water supply, and water supplying pipes, cisterns, and apparatus for scouring the same, and for causing the same to convey away the soil, and fit and proper sand traps, expanding inlets, and other apparatus for hindering the entry of improper substances therein, and all other such fit and proper works and arrangements as may appear to the vestry or board, or to their officers, requisite to secure the safe and proper working of the said drain, and to prevent the same from obstructing or otherwise injuring or impeding the action of the sewer to which it leads; and it shall be lawful for the said vestry or board to cause the said works to be inspected while in progress, and from time to time during their execution to order such reasonable alterations therein, additions thereto, and abandonment of part or parts thereof, as may to the vestry or board, or their officers, appear, on the fuller knowledge afforded by the opening of the ground, requisite to secure the complete and perfect working of such works; and if the owner of such house or building neglect or refuse during twenty-eight days after the said notice has been delivered to such owner or left at such house or building, to begin to construct such drain and other works aforesaid, or any of them, or thereafter fail to carry them on and complete them with all reasonable despatch, it shall be lawful for the vestry or board to cause the same to be constructed and made, and to recover the expenses to be incurred thereby from such owner in the manner hereinafter provided. Sec. 74.—If it appear to the vestry or board of any parish or district that a group or block of contiguous houses, or of adjacent, detached, or semi-detached houses, may be improved and drained more economically or advantageously in combination than separately, and a sewer of sufficient size already exist or be about to be constructed within one hundred feet of any part of such group or block of houses, whether contiguous, detached, or semi-detached, it shall be lawful for such board or vestry to order that such group or block of houses be drained and improved, as hereinbefore provided, by a combined operation. 48 Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862. Sec, 112 ****** the word " drain " shall be deemed to apply to and include the subject-matters specified in the two hundred and fiftieth section of the firstly-recited Act, and also any drain for draining a group or block of houses by a combined operation, laid or constructed before the 1st day of January, 1856, pursuant to the order or direction or with the sanction or approval of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers. ****** In London, therefore, we have this position, that the " drain " also includes " any drain for draining any group or block of houses by a combined operation under the order of any Vestry or District Board" and it is " lawful for such Board or Vestry to order that such group or block of houses be drained * * * * * by a combined operation." This definition being subsequently extended to include "any drain for draining a group or block of houses by a combined operation, laid or constructed before the 1st day of January, 1856, pursuant to the order or direction or with the sanction or approval of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers." A combined drain constructed before 1856, without the order or direction or sanction or approval of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers is illegally constructed, and a combined drain constructed subsequently to 1855, without the order of the Yestry or District Board, is also illegally constructed. As to combined drains constructed subsequently to 1855, it would be advisable for your Yestry to have extracted from the Minutes and indexed all the orders made by your Vestry for this purpose, and I would beg to recommend that this course be adopted. As to combined drains constructed prior to 1856, it would also be advisable for your Vestry to cause (o be extracted and indexed from the records of the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, in possession of the London County Council, a list of all the applications made, and of the orders, directions, sanctions, or approvals made or given by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers. Even without any formal order or direction, if it is to be assumed that drains were constructed with sanction or approval, the owners are responsible for their maintenance, andif,having served their time and become defective andnuisances, new drains require to be laid, Section 73 of the Act of 1855, above quoted, would appear to apply. REGENTS CANAL. The notice served on the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company on the 14th November, 1892, not having been complied with, your Vestry decided on the 27th September, 1893,— (a) That a further statutory notice be served on the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company, requiring the Company to abate within a period of seven days, certain nuisances existing in that portion of the Regents Canal, in the Parish of St. Pancras, and for that purpose:— 49 1.—To forthwith properly cleanse and scavenge the surface of so much of the Regent's Canal and the banks thereof as lie within the said Parish of St. Pancras, and henceforth to do so three times a week, on alternate days, throughout the months of June, July, and August in each year, and twice in each week throughout the other remaining months in each year. 2.—To forthwith cleanse and scavenge the bottom of so much of the said Canal as aforesaid, including the lav-byes and basins thereof, and to that end to clear away and remove therefrom the mud and all other deposits, by dredging, or other effective means, and henceforth to perform these and any other necessaay works once in each year. .3.—To concrete such parts of so much of the said Canal as aforesaid, including the basins and lay byes, and other places adjacent to wharves as are likely to allow mud and other deposits to accumulate. 4.—To construct an overflow at the southern end of Cumberland Market Basin, so as to change water in such basin and prevent stagnation thereof. (b) That in case the said Company make default in complying with the notice referred to, the matter be referred to the Vestry's Solicitors to take such proceedings_ as may be necessary for the abatement of such nuisances. In November, your Vestry called the attention of the County Council to the insufficient flow of water in the Regents and Grand Junction Canals, and asked for the necessary steps to be taken to obtain legislation to remedy the evil. Subsequently at a Conference of the various Sanitary Authorities at the London County Council, it was decided to address a communication to the Board of Trade as to the insufficient flow of water along the Canal. The Statutory Notices served upon the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company not being complied with, [ examined the Canal in detail throughout iis course in St. Pancras and ascertained the situation, extent, and depth of the accumulations of mud along the channel and in the lay-byes and off-shoots. The North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company subsequentlyagreed to a conjoint sounding and inspection of the Canal, &c., by a representative of the Company and a Sanitary Inspector of the Vestry, for the purpose of verifying the accumulations of mud stated to exist. Many lay-byes and docks being in the occupation of private owners, responsible for their condition and maintenance, contained accumulations of mud, and as they were not the property of the Canal Company notices were served upon the owners to remove the deposits and accumulations. Many hundreds of tons of mud have been removed from the water way, lay-bves, etc. of the Canal, and there is now a fair prospect of improvement in the condition of the Regent's Canal. The laying of a sewer to drain the Zoological Gardens is still under the consideration of your Vestry, in conjunction with the Vestry of St. Marylebone. 50 REFUSE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL. The following are the numbers of dust-complaints received each quarter during the last three years :— 1891 1892 1893 1st Quarter 6812 8404 49 2nd „ †5170 *1867 60 3rd ,, 3092 26 2 4th „ 3571 38 11 Total 18,645 10,335 122 t Transferred from Works to Health Department. * New system of collection introduced. The effect of the weekly collection of dust from house to-house must be beneficial to the health, comfort, and peace of mind of the inhabitants of the whole District. Your Vestry wisely recognised that it would not be possible for yorr Authority itself to efficiently undertake the work of collection and removal of dust until provision had been made for its disposal. The Destructor now being erected in the King's Road will remove the great difficulty of disposal, compared to which collection and removal are more simple matters. In expectation of the completion of the Destructor, clauses have been inserted in the " Dust Contracts" requiring the contractors when called upon to deliver the refuse at the Destructor for disposal, and to allow a rebate per cubit yard so delivered. NUISANCES. Dead Animals.—Last year I called attention to the difficulty of destroying small domestic animals, dogs and cats, and of disposing of the bodies of such animals, whether killed properly or accidentally, or dying of age or of disease. I suggested that it was worth the consideration of your Vestry to provide a place where such animals might be painlessly put out of existence and their bodies disposed of without nuisance, instead of encumbering the Regent's Canal, vacant spaces, and thoroughfares. The possession of a Destructor will enable the bodies to be destroyed readily, and in addition it simply requires a small Kennel furnished witb a charcoal brazier to put painlessly out of existence any animals that may be brought, by those who are frequently distressed beyond measure by their inability to provide a painless death for their domestic companions. 51 SUMMONSES Under the Public Health (London) Act, Metropolis Local Management Acts, Factory and Workshop Acts, and Housing of the Workino Classes Act.

During 1893, three Acts of Sanitary importance were passed. The Rivers Pollution Prevention Act, 1893 (56 8f 57 Vict., Chap. 31), provides that where any sewage matter falls or flows, or is carried into any stream, after passing through or along a channel which is vested in a sanitary authority, the sanitary authority shall for the purposes of sec. 3 of the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act of 1876, be deemed to knowingly permit the sewage matter so to fall, flow, or to be carried. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Amendment Act, 1893 (56 Sf 57. Vict., Chap. 47), empowers Vestries and District Boards to incur expenses in acquiring land, wharves, destructors, plant, and equipment for the collection, removal and disposal of refuse. The Isolation Hospitals Act, 1893 (56 & 57 Vic., Chap. 68), empowers Countv Councils to make enquiry into the provision of hospitals for infectious diseases and to establish hospital districts and boards. An 1893 Amending Act of the Shop Hours Act, 1892, also became part of the law of the land. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN F. J. SYKES. 59 Table No. 1. ST.
