UXBR 3 UXBRIDGE RURAL DISTRICT COUNCIL. 1898. ANNUAL MEDICAL REPORT BY CHARLES ROBERTS, Mdical Officer of Health Lucy & Birch, General Printers, Uxbridge. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. 1898. Uxbridge, 24th February, 1899. To the Chairman and Member of Uxbridge Rural District Council. Geneleman- In presenting my Annual Report for the year 1898, I beg in thefirst place to acquaint you that 313 deaths took place from all causes during the Year in the District, but from these 58 have to be deducted as having occurred within the district among people not belonging thereto, of these 29 belonged to SouthallNorwood Urban District and 29 to the Uxbridge Urban District, leaving 255 which belonged to our own District. I have calculated the gross population to the middle of last year at 15,355 but from this number 32 have to be deducted who were living in our district but did not belong to it, this makes the total of our population 15,323. Dividing the number of deaths by the population gives a death rate of 16.6 per thousand which is rather higher than last year when it was 15'02; the increase is due principally to deaths from diseases of the lungs which in 1897 amounted to 43, but in 1898 to 72. The death-rate in each parish is as follows:— Population 1891. Population 1898. Number of Deaths. Death Rate per 1000. Hayes 2651 2651 47 17.7 Northolt 504 510 12 23.5 Hillingdon East 2383 2521 34 13.4 Yiewsley 2623 2782 35 12.5 Cowley 802 853 18 21.1 West Drayton 1118 1198 21 17.5 Ruislip 1836 2111 29 13.7 Harefield 1866 2129 24 11.2 Ickenham 396 410 5 12.1 4 The various causes of the deaths are stated in Table A and are as follows:- Scarlatina 1 Diphtheria 35 Enteric Fever 5 Measles 6 Whooping Cough 1 Diarrhoea and Dysentery 19 Phthisis 34 Bronchitis &c. 48 Heart Disease 28 Injuries 12 All other Diseases 124 313 The deaths which have to be deducted as not belonging to our district are Diphtheria 29; Diarrhœa 1; Phthisis 4; Bronchitis 6; Heart Disease 3; and all other Diseases 15; Total 58. The births amounted to 456 which gives a birth-rate of 29.7 per 1000 which is less than last year when it was 33.02. During the year I received 117 notifications of Infectious diseases classified as follows:— Scarlatina 39 Diphtheria 38 Enteric Fever 15 Erysipelas 25 117 The total is less than last year by 38 5 The various Parishes were answerable for these diseases in the following proportions. scarlatina.

Deaths in our district from Zymotic diseases amounted to 37, which gives a death rate from these diseases of 2.4 per 1000. I will now deal with each parish. Hayrs.—This parish has shown a more healthy record than during the previous year, notifications only amounting to 21, as against 54. There were however more cases of Diphtheria, but many less cases of Scarlatina. There still exists the unsatisfactory condition of foul ditches and stagnant pools, and it is very desirable that a thorough system of drainage should be carried out. An enquiry was held at Dr. Triplett's Schools, in the Autumn by an Inspector from the Local Government Board. I understand a difficulty has arisen with that Board as to the outfall site, and also as to the drainage of Yeading. I trust this difficulty will be overcome, and the much needed drainage of this parish carried out. In the spring the water from the public pump at Yeading was found to be of inferior quality. I, together with your Inspector, made a thorough examination of the well and wrote your Council a report on June 17th in which I stated that " I " could find no source of contamination; the one exception is that the crown of the " well is lower than the surrounding ground, and on removing the lid of the well " we noticed the upper courses of the bricks were damp, and were informed that " during rain, water collects over the Crown. We are of opinion that this is a " source of contamination, and advise that the Crown of the well should be raised, 6 " so that the land shall fall from instead of towards it, and also that the brick " courses shall be rendered in Cement so as to prevent any percolation." I have recently made a qualitative Analysis of this water and am sorry to say I find it still to be of very inferior quality." In July and August three cases of Scarlatina were notified at a Farm in this parish, and from enquiries made I came to the conclusion that in all probability these cases arose from communication with friends in another district, where illness of a very suspicious nature had occurred. During the year I have inspected many foul ditches, piggeries, and dirty cottages in this parish, all of which cases were brought to your notice by your Inspector. Northolt.—The death rate in this small parish 23.5 per 1000 is unusually high, but it is not due to any special disease, and the only deaths due to infectious diseases are two from Measles. Hillingdon East.—The general condition of this parish has been healthy, and the death rate is low; only 15 notifications were received throughout the year. Two cases of Enteric Fever occurred, one in Beaconsfield Terrace and the other at Little London Farm, one was in February and the other in October. I found nothing wrong with the water, and was unable to trace the cause of disease in either case. All cases of Scarlatina, 6 in number, were removed to the Isolation Hospital, to which fact I attribute the non-spreading of the disease. In December I was requested to inspect a Gipsy encampment on "No Mans Land" and reported to your Council on the subject; there were 4 caravans and 4 tents which each contained on an average 4 inmates: all appeared healthy and happy, and there was no nuisance, and I need not enter into the legal aspect of the matter. Yieicsley —This parish shows the second best death rate of all the larger parishes, being only 12.5 per 1000, but it exceeded its sister parish, Hillingdon East, in the number of infectious cases notified, which was 30 as against Hillingdon East, 15. In January action had to be taken in consequence of a large heap of London sweepings having been deposited on land adjoining the Canal and close to the Para Rubber Works: the case was taken before the Magistrates and a Prohibitory order was obtained. I think this has had a salutary effect, as we have not been troubled so much of late by these nuisances to which I called your attention in my last annual report. 7 In May a large heap of London sweepings was deposited on land close to Ernest Road, Horton Road, in all about 360 Tons, and reached to within six feet of a row of Cottages. I reported this matter to your Council and stated that I thought it would be a source of danger in the future and should be removed. I regret your Council did not view the matter in the same light. Complaint was made in October of another enormous heap of this same refuse which had been deposited on land near the Varnish Works, but as this was in an isolated position, and had been covered by earth, I did not consider it a nuisance injurious to health. In March an epidemic of Measles occurred, and it was considered advisable to close the schools for a time. Cowley.—This small parish, like Northolt, has I am sorry to say a very high death rate 21.1, but this is due to general causes and not to any specified disease, and only two cases of infectious disease were notified during the year, viz. :— from Erysipelas. I am of opinion that the condition of this parish will be much improved by the new system of drainage which will shortly be brought about. West Drayton.—The death rate of this parish is not excessive, but is 2 per 1000 higher than last year. Nothing to call for notice in this report occurred during the year. Ruislip.—In my last annual report I commented on the high death rate of this parish 18 2. I am pleased to state on this occasion it is only 13.7. In February an epidemic of Measles occurred at Northwood, and the schools were closed for a period of three weeks. In September a case of Enteric Fever was notified, and this was followed by three others in October, and one in December. I made a careful inquiry in order to ascertain the cause if possible, and came to the conclusion that the four first cases might have arisen from water in an unclean cistern, and the one in December to water in a pond which I certified to be of bad quality. In December four cases of Diphtheria were notified from Northwood, and gave rise to alarm in that portion of the parish. I recently made a special report to your Council on these cases in which I stated I was unable to trace the cause or sequence of the cases, at the same time the general condition of this part of the parish is favourable to this disease, as the soil is of clay which holds a considerable amount of moisture, and drainage is sadly wanted; this is a growing district, prettily 8 situated, and within easy distance from London, the sooner therefore a proper system of drainage is carried out, the better it will be for the welfare of the neighbourhood; all present drains and cesspits should be abolished, together with dirty ditches and stagnant pools. Harefied.—As usual this parish has the lowest death rate of all the large parishes, being only 11'2, which is due in my opinion to its elevated position, gravel soil, and systematic flushing of the sewer. In April and May three cases of Scarlatina were notified. I wrote to the Vicar advising, that no child should be admitted to the schools from any infected cottage, and at the same time an Epidemic of Measles arose with regard to which I gave the same advice. No more cases of Scarlatina occurred, but I cannot say whether it was the same with regard to Measles, as it is not a notifiable disease. With these exceptions this parish has been in a healthy condition during the year. Ickenham.—In this small parish four cases of Diphtheria were notified, and one of Enteric Fever. In February the case of Typhoid occurred in a travelling caravan ard might have arisen in another district, or from drinking foul water near where the van was located. In October a child of the master of the school developed Diphtheria, and was at once sent to the Isolation Hospital, the school was closed for a week and no other case occurred. In December however three other cases were notified: these were at once removed to the Hospital and no further case Occurred. Joint Hospital.—During the year 227 patients were admitted into this institution and belonged to the various districts as follows:— Scarlatina. Diphtheria. Total. Uxbridge Urban District 7 85 92 Uxbridge Rural District 31 18 49 Southall Norwood District 7 79 86 45 182 227 There were 34 deaths, one being from Scarlatina and the remainder from Diphtheria: of these 14 belonged to the Uxbridge Urban District, 15 to Southall Norwood and 5 to our own district. 9 The patients admitted from our own district belonged to the parishes as follows:— Scarlatina. Diphtheria. Total. Hayes ll 3 14 Northolt 3 0 3 Hillingdon East 6 l 7 Yiewsley 4 7 11 Cowley 0 0 0 West Drayton 5 0 5 liuislip 0 0 0 Harefield 2 1 3 Ickenham 0 6 6 31 18 49 This compares favourably with last year when we sent 90 into the Hospital. This Institution is well conducted, but is at times overcrowded, and I would still urge that Southall Norwood should have an Institution of its own. Workhouse.—This Institution is as clean and well conducted as ever. Two cases of Enteric Fever were notified from it during the year, but they were both imported cases. Water.—I have made qualitative analyses of 13 samples of water during the year, 4 of which I condemned as unfit to be used for domestic purposes, and sent Certificates to that effect to your Council, and where water has been of doubtful quality samples have been sent to Dr. Muter for a quantitative analysis, and the results in all cases submitted to your Council. Soft Core.—Your are aware that for years past large quantities of this most offensive manure has from time to time been imported into our district, more especially in the parishes of Yiewsley and Cowley ; it is a nuisance, injurious to health, and I would advise your Council to take strong measures to exclude it except in isolated positions: in addition to being a nuisance, it is detrimental to the value of property when deposited near habitations. I am pleased to acquaint your Council that the Uxbridge Urban Sewage Works have been completed and the etHuent is much purer than under the old system: the discharge is however still somewhat offensive and there is a yellow deposit. Drainage.—The sewerage of Hillingdon East, Yiewsley, West Drayton, and Cowley has been in progress for some months past, and is now approaching 10 completion. I am of opinion that it will be a great boon to all those parishes in the improvement of their sanitary condition. I hope ample means will be provided for systematic flushing, as sewers without this provision are often a source of disease. I have already stated with regard to Harefield that I believe its comparative immunity from Zymotic diseases is due to this provision, and I am of opinion that if it were more stringently adopted generally, there would be far less of these diseases. I trust that during the present year your Council will earnestly take into consideration the drainage both of Hayes and Ruislip, as I consider both parishes are urgently in need of it. Appended to this report is a statement of matters dealt with throughout the district by yourlnspector and Assistant Inspector. Both officers have acted promptly and cheerfully in all matters I have submitted to them, and the former has supplied me with the statistics relating to the Joint Hospital. The following is a summary of their report:— Cowley 38 *Harefield 80 *Hayes 110 Hillingdon East 116 Ickenham 20 Northolt 15 *Rui8lip 104 *West Drayton 29 *Yiewsley 95 607 Periodical scavenging has been carried out during the year in the Parishes marked with an Asterisk. All Dairies and Cowsheds in the Dis-trict in respect of which certificates have been granted, (numbering 46) have been duly inspected, as required by the regulations relating to same. The master of the Workhouse has been good enough to supply me with the statistics relating to that Institution. I am Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHAS. ROBERTS. M 3.
