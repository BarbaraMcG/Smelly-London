The district, with an acreage of some 20,000, is one of the largest Urban. Districts in the country and has many open spaces, parks and recreation grounds. Many of the factories and dweilinghouses use smokeless fuels and consequently the atmosphere is comparatively free from smoke pollution.

Two of these are a considerable distance from the road, but two premises are within 80 ft. of the Metropolitan Water Board Main. Fourteen week-end bungalows are not connected to a main water supply. The total number of premises still dependent upon stored rainwater or well supply is made up as follows:- WARD Number of premises with Stored rainwater Well Supply Biggin Hill 10 – Chelsfield 2 – Cudham 2 – Downe 2 – Farnborough – 3 Green Street Green 3 – Knockholt 1 – 20 3 The Metropolitan Water Board supplies the main water for the whole of the district. The Public Health Department obtains samples of this water at monthly intervals from various dwelling houses throughout the district. Forty-seven samples were taken and the Analyst's reports show that they were all satisfactory. The Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly reported on the water supply to the Urban District during the year 1964:- "The water supply to the Orpington Urban District was satisfactory in quantity and quality during the year 1964. The supply to the district of Orpington was derived from Sundridge, Lullingstone, Eynsford, Horton Kirby, Orpington and North Orpington Wells. There vrere no new sources of supply instituted by the Board in this area during the year 1964 and there were no new important extensions of trunk mains, but a total length of 3,922 yards of local supply mains were laid in your area during the year." The following tables give the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the various supplies to Orpington during 1964. 25.

SECTION D HOUSING 28. SECTION D, HOUSING- CLEARANCE AREAS AND INDIVIDUAL UNFIT DWELLINGS As reported last year, there are no clearance areas to be dealt with but there is a small number of individual unfit houses to which attention will be given in the amalgamated programme for the new borough. RENT ACT, 1957 This Act came into force on the 6th July, 1957° The role of the Health Department in the administration of the Act is confined almost entirely to the consideration of applications made by tenants of controlled houses for Certificates of Disrepair. In broad terms the possession of this Certificate enables a tenant to resist the rent increase permitted by the Act and the granting of a Certificate is justified only where the dwelling is in disrepair by reason of defects which ought reasonably to be remedied "having due regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling". Five applications for a Certificate of Disrepair were received during the year. HOUSING ACT, 1961 This Act extends and amends the principal Act of 1557° Twenty-six Applications for Improvement G-rants were approved during the year, the majority of these being from owner/occupiers. HOUSING- ACT 1964. This Act came into force in August 1964. Amongst other things, it confers powers upon Local Authorities to compel the carrying out of works for the improvement of dwellings which are without any or all of the standard amenities, viz:- a fixed bath or shower, a wash-hand basin, a hot and cold water supply at a fixed bath or shower, a hot and cold water supply at a wash-hand basin, a hot and cold water supply at a sink, a water closet and satisfactory facilities for storing food. 29. HOUSING STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1964 Total number of valuation assessments, houses and flats, at 31st December, 19&4 25,370 (1) (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for defects (under the Public Health or Housing Acts) 119 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 475 (2) Number of dwelling houses (included under sub-head (l) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations,1925 Nil (3) Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. 2 (4) Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 87 (5) Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Ox ficers 66 (6) (a) Unfit houses demolished Nil (b) Unfit houses closed 2 MOVEABLE DWELLINGS Sixty-three visits were made to the six caravan sites. The position is the same as last year, There are two licensed sites and four more are still under consideration. Consideration is now being given to the estimated cost of establishing a site for twelve gypsy caravans at St.Paul's Cray Hill Park of which mention was made in last year's report. 30 EE-HOUSING I am indebted to the Housing and Estates Manager for the following statistics on re—housing carried out by the Local Authority Prior to 1964 During 1964 Total as at December 1964 l.(a) No..of "permanentdwellings built by Local Authority 2,532 42 2,574 (b) No. of pre-fabricated dwellings built by Local Authority 308 - 297 (II demolished) 2.(a) No.of families occupying l(a) 2,574 plus lodgers (b) No.of families occupying l(b) 297 plus lodgers 3.
