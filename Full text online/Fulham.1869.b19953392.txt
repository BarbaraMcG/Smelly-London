HAMMERSMITH, 28th May, 1870. Gentlemen, We have examined the Books and Vouchers of your Board for the year ending March 25th, 1870. We found a balance at the commencement of the year of £938. 7s. 3d., and we leave a balance in favor of the Board of £1504 0d. 9d. We are painfully conscious of the considerable amount due from the Parish of Fulham to your Board, but inasmuch as former arrears have been made the subject of comment on other occasions, we decline saying anything further on the matter. We have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the great clearness and accuracy with which the Books have been uniformly kept. We are, Gentlemen, Yours very truly, (Signed) THOS. DURRAN, JAMES S. WHICHELOW, HENRY DORMAN, Auditors. 9 FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS, FULHAM DISTRICT. Gentlemen, Another year has passed away, and it is my duty to lay before you a resume of the sanitary condition of our District, since my last Annual Report. It is in these yearly documents, too little read and far too much disregarded by the public, that they have laid before them the danger or security they have experienced. It is in them that they are told what has been done to mitigate or avert the perils of epidemic sickness, and what is necessary to be accomplished in order to reap the full benefit of Sanitary Science. It is in them they see the result of the almost silent working of our Hygienic system, and how they have more or less shared the good arising out of Sanitary Laws, here so unobtrusively carried out, as to escape even the semblance of complaint or of oppression. Now and then a tale of trouble is told, an outbreak of Scarlet Fever comes only to be nipped as it were in the bud; it finds no resting place as hitherto amongst us. Small Pox too by isolation and prompt removal of early cases to the Hospital takes no stronghold. The Zymotic diseases incidental to childhood, certainly have lost much of their intensity and fatality through sanitary regime, whilst the more malignant Epidemic, Cholera, we know can be satisfactorily checked and kept in abeyance. Who then can murmur at the insignificant cost of carrying out protective laws so full of good? It may indeed be said, that no large communities can now exist without a special Board of Health, as one of their necessities. In 1861, the population of London was 2,803,989, of which the western districts contained 463,388. In the middle of June, 1869, London was computed, by the Registrar General, to contain not less than 3,170,754 inhabitants, and of these, I have no doubt the western districts still contained their due proportion, in fact from the marvellous increase in building operations around us during the last decennial period it is more than likely that the proportion had considerably increased. The Registrar General indeed computes the number for the middle of the present year at 540,647 in the western group. In my last report I gave a summary of the principal drainage works, which had been carried out by your Board, for the Sanitary improvement of the District. During the last year little has been done in this direction, for, it may be said, our present requirements are all but satisfied. The drainage of St, Peter's Square, Ravenscourt Park 10 i • and of some private roads in Fulham form the principal portion of the work. In almost all my previous reports I have felt necessitated to refer to that blot in our Escutcheon, the "Creek." It still continues in all its abominable features, a most disgusting source of mischief, and of constant complaints. The time has arrived when something effectual must be done to rid us once and for ever from this filthy cesspool. The formation of a handsome street leading to the river front, was some years since planned by Mr. Bean, a most worthy substitute for the existing mud pool. This would be an ornament to our Town, and form a most useful approach to both middle and lower Malls. The formation of Lock Gates at the entrance, to keep it constantly full of water, would be more immediately practicable, and might be so arranged as not to interfere with wharfage rights, or the storm overflow of the Stamford Brook Sewer. The conversion of the Creek from its present pestilential state appears almost to offeran indefinite number of propositions for good to our Town. Here is another. It has very recently and with much good sense been proposed to convert the Serpentine into a sea bathing place for Londoners, by the conveyance of sea-water from Brighton through stone-ware culverts. The pumping of the water to a reservoir on the Brighton Downs, about 80 feet above the level of the sea being considered sufficient for the purpose, and from which the water would flow by gravitation to the London basin. It is contemplated that by setting aside a certain portion of the water thus conveyed for private bathing, that a sufficient amount might be realized for defraying all but the entire expense of the undertaking, but whether or no this may be the case, the benefit to Londoners in general could not be overstated, It is not my view to extend this abstract idea to the "Creek," I only wish again to draw the attention of our District to the Fever breeding pool within us, and to shew how easily it might be converted to a health giving means. It will be unnecessary to remind the inhabitants of Hammersmith how often I have pointed out this spot as that most fitted for a public swimming bath. Thanks to the perseverance of a comparatively small band of energetic men, this great desideratum for Hammersmith has been accomplished, though not upon the site of the Creek. And here, as Officer of Health, I feel bound to say a great boon has been conferred upon us. A visit to the Baths in Blacks Road will convince the most sceptical, that our Town can boast of both Swimming and Private Baths (as means of health) which may rank amongst the most handsome and best conducted in the Metropolis. The cool and refreshing invitation offered here by the noble Swimming Bath, in the Summer months ought to be irresistible, whilst the elegant and comfortable provision for private hot and cold Baths during all seasons of the year, cannot fail to prove also a source of profit and satisfaction to the Company. The advantages of this Institution, however, are as yet confined to 1st and 2nd class bathers. It is here my purpose to offer a plea for those unable to avail themselves of them. Cannot the Creek be made available for a free public Swimming Bath for the working classes? The annals of the Coroner's Court have shewn 11 a mournful sacrifice of life from "Drowned whilst bathing in the Thames." Here, at a comparatively small and insignificant cost, a Free Swimjtiing Bath may be formed by a Philanthropic effort, which while it saves the loss of life, may render no longer necessary the issue of the annual Police notice of caution against "Indecent Bathing in the Thames," and will exempt the residents of the immediate vicinity of the Creek from the present disgusting and baneful effects. The mortality of London in 1869, the Registrar General says, has been exceptionally high, and therefore, as might be expected, that of the Fulham District has coincided, though the excess has certainly not arisen from any special outbreak of Epidemic disease amongst us. Our total number of deaths has been 1,395, of which Hammersmith has contributed 823 and Fulham 572. The average mortality, the Registrar General says, for 30 years, of the five regions of London, ranges from 23 in the north and 23 in the west, to 25 in the south, 25 in the central, to 26 in the east districts. In the year 1869, the mortality exceeded these averages everywhere, "except in the west districts, and in south London, where the effects of drainage are manifest. The mortality was at the rate of 28 per 1000 in the east districts." Scarlet Fever has prevailed not only in London, but throughout the country, and is one of the most difficult Epidemics to stay by Sanitary measures; its poison (the most subtle of any) is most easily conveyed, and the disease affecting to a great extent the better classes of society, renders the necessary supervision more difficult to carry out. The practice of sending children to schools from infected houses, and of sending children home from school, where the disease appears, is a most constant means of propagating it. The number of deaths from Scarlet Fever within the Fulham District in 1869 has been 67, from Fevers of various types 42, from Measles 6, from Whooping Cough 49, from Diarrhœa 110, and from Diptheria 9. No death from Small Pox has been registered. The number of Births registered in the 52 weeks ending Saturday, January 2nd, 1870, was 2,161. I am, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, Hammersmith, June 8th, 1870. FREDk. J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE FULHAM DISTRICT.
