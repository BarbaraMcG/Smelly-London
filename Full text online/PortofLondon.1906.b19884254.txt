LONDON: Printed by Charles Skipper & East, 49, Great Tower Street, E.C. 1907. TRELOAR, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 11th day of April, 1907. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Port to the 31st December, 1906; which was read. And a Motion being made and Question put, That this Court doth agree with the Committee in their said Report, the same was resolved in the Affirmative. Ordered, That the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Eight Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. We whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation, as the Port of London Sanitary Authority, by the Local Government Board, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Herbert Williams, the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London, for the year ended the 31st December, 1906, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work done in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. The Aliens Act, 1905, came into operation on the 1st January, 1906, and the Medical Officer of Health was appointed the Medical Inspector under that Act. Particulars are given as to the number of alien immigrants arriving, and of the work carried out in connection with their medical inspection. The number of cases of Infectious Disease dealt with during the year shows a large increase both in the number of cases reported, and also in the number treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital. Outbreaks of Enteric Fever on the Training Ship "Cornwall" and of Scarlet Fever on the Training Ship "Arethusa" are fully described. The Medical Officer of Health also points out that some of these Training Ships are provided with insufficient accommodation for the isolation of cases of Infectious Disease; he furthermore expresses a doubt as to whether the practice of training boys on board ship should be continued. The Merchant Shipping Bill passed both Houses of Parliament during the year, and your Committee instructed Mr. Remembrancer to confer with the Medical Officer of Health, and to do what was possible to improve the sanitary condition of the crew's quarters on board ships, with the result, that a clause was inserted in the new Act which increased the cubical space per head from 72 to 120 cubic feet, and from 12 to 15 square feet of superficial area. The Medical Officer of Health also reports on the condition of the River Thames and the River Medway within the jurisdiction of this Authority. Samples of water were taken at various points, and the results of the analyses are set out in tabulated form. These figures show clearly that the water coming over Teddington Weir contains much impurity, and in its passage from there to the sea it is subject to considerable pollution, but owing to the tendency of running water to purify itself, the river water, except in certain places in the vicinity of sewer outfalls, cannot, be said to be in a gross state of pollution. The analysis of samples of water taken during the flood tide from Woolwich to London Bridge shows that some of the sewage effluent discharged at Barking is brought up the river during the flood tide, as high as London Bridge, and the Medical Officer of Health points out that it is important that those who discharge such effluent into the river should adopt the best possible means of purifying the effluent before so discharging it. Reference is made to the want of additional powers in dealing with the sanitary defects on shore premises within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. • Your Committee have already made representations to the Local Government Board as to this. In accordance with the Order of your Honourable Court, an account of Receipts and Expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary Authority, for the year ended 31st December last, is appended for the information of the Court. All which we submit to the judgment of this Honourable Court. Dated this ninth day of April, 1907. Horace S. Dove. T. Hastings Miller. W. H. Williamson. E. H. Haywood. cuthbert w. whitaker. Chas. M.

TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1906, being the fifth of the series. The result of the work carried out by the Staff is shown in figures which are tabulated under their respective headings. Viewed generally, these show a condition of steady progress. Notwithstanding that the number of vessels arriving at Gravesend from foreign ports was less than during the year 1905, there was an actual increase of trade in the Port of London during the year. It appears from figures supplied by the Thames Conservancy that there was a substantial increase in the amount of tonnage entering the Port. Considerable and special attention has been paid to the inspection of that class of vessel employed wholly on inland waters, namely, canal boats, barges and the like, with satisfactory results. It should, however, be noted that a much larger number of these boats has been inspected during the past year than in any previous year, and that this fact is also related to the increase in trade previously mentioned. Improvements in the sanitary condition of barges and like craft are becoming more general. Owners and lightermen are beginning to appreciate the importance of attention to this point, especially in those vessels engaged in the carriage of foul and offensive cargoes. Details of these will be found under the heading devoted to nuisances on vessels. Growth in another direction of the work of the Authority is shown in the ections dealing with nuisances on shore, drainage and other sanitary works. (See Tables XXVI. and XXVII.) 8 Even at the present time cesspits are largely relied upon in certain of the Docks as a means of sewage disposal, but improvement in this direction is gradual, and drainage into local sewers, wherever practicable, is now insisted on. This development adds materially to the work of your Officers. Special reference was made to this in my last Annual Report, where it is shown that some difficulty is experienced in dealing with sanitary defects in shore premises owing to the lack of adequate powers, and that application was then about to be made to the Local Government Board to extend certain further sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to the Fort Sanitary Authority. This application was accordingly made in February of the year now under review, and there the matter at present stands. The several Dock Companies cannot understand why they should be under the jurisdiction of two Sanitary Authorities, and this renders it difficult to get certain necessary sanitary works carried out. MEDICAL INSPECTION. Gravesend.—Table I. The number of vessels arriving in the Port of London from "foreign" ports was less during 1906 than the previous year, and slightly below the average for the previous five years. Owing to the continued presence of Plague in various ports, stringent medical inspection of arrivals from those ports has been necessary, with the result that more vessels were medically inspected during 1906 than in any previous year. Sheerness.—Table II. The figures for Sheerness show a considerable advance in the number of vessels arriving from "foreign" ports during the year, the total being above the average for the previous five years. The number of vessels medically inspected was 320; and this duty has been satisfactorily carried out by Dr. Legge, who is in charge of the station there. 9 TABLE I. MEDICAL INSPECTION—GRAYESEND.

The Aliens Act, 1905, came into operation on January 1st, 1906, and I have been responsible for the carrying out of the medical inspection in the Port of London under that Act, with the aid of the Assistant Medical Officers at Gravesend. According to the Act, any ship that brings more than 20 alien steerage passengers, or such number of those passengers as the Secretary of State may fix, is an immigrant ship. The number was at first fixed at 12, but in the early part of March this order was withdrawn, and the number now remains at 20. The work of inspection has been carried out between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.. and arrangements were made so as to have constantly the services of two medical officers available for the work of medical inspection, whilst the medical officer on boarding duty could act in case of any emergency. The alien immigrant vessels arrive—in the majority of instances—several hours after the expected time of arrival, and this unpunctuality has necessitated many hours of tedious waiting on the part of the officers concerned in the work of inspection, no information respecting them being available between the time of departure from the Continental port and the arrival of the vessel in Gravesend Eeach. The medical inspection was carried out at the same time as that performed by the Immigration Officer, a private cabin being usually placed at the disposal of the Medical Officer in order that the medical examination might be carried out decently and in order. A certain proportion of the alien steerage passengers were found to be "undesirable" on medical grounds, and were refused leave to land. In nearly every instance these persons appealed to the Immigration Board, which met at Brunswick Wharf, Blackwall, and a certain number of the appeals were allowed, and the appellants permitted to land. I have personally attended the majority of these meetings, after a careful examination of any alien passenger who had been rejected on medical grounds, so that any alien passenger who has had to return to his own country on account, of medical grounds has been rejected on the opinion of myself as well as that of the medical officer who examined the passenger at Gravesend. 11 Aliens arriving in the United Kingdom during the twelve months ending December 31st, 1906, according to the official returns issued by the Home Office:— All Ports.

Non-Immigrant and Immigrant Ships. During the year, 1,975 non-immigrant ships arrived in the Port of London, bringing 29,290 passengers; and 550 immigrant ships, bringing 43,534 passengers. Transmigrants were all examined with a view to the detection of any case of an infectious disorder amongst them, whilst the immigrants were subjected to a more careful and thorough examination.

The total number of visits of inspection paid by your Inspectors during the year was 35,348. Of these, 13,013 were made on vessels from "foreign" ports, 3,917 on vessels arriving "coastwise"; 16,881 referred to barges and other vessels engaged in other than sea-going trade, including canal boats, while 1,537 inspections were of premises on shore within the area of the Docks. The cleansing of the crew's quarters was ordered in 2,960 cases. The nationalities of the vessels inspected—in order of importance—were: British, 81 per cent.; Swedish and Norwegian, 4 per cent,; German, 3 per cent.; Dutch and Belgian, 1 per cent. respectively, and various others in lesser proportion. 13 TABLE III General Summary, and Analysis, of the Sanitary Inspection of Vessels, &c., in the Port of London, for the year ending 31st December, 1906.

The total number of cases of Infectious Disease of all kinds reported on vessels entering the Port during the year was 336, a number largely in excess of the average for the previous five years. Table IV. gives particulars of these, from which it will be seen that Scarlet Fever heads the list with 82 cases, of which 28 were treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital, Enteric Fever being next in frequency with 81 cases, 27 being treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital. Of Measles, 68 cases were reported, but only three were treated at Denton Hospital, the remainder being cases which occurred either on one of the training ships, or on vessels during the voyage. The total number of cases treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital was 91, the average number for the five preceding years being 79'6. CHOLERA. There appears to have been no outbreak of Cholera on the Continent of Europe during the year 1906, though a few cases were reported in the early part of the year in certain parts of Western Russia. Cholera existed, of course, in India, especially in the Bengal Presidency where, up to August, some 130,000 persons died. Cholera also existed in Siam, Ceylon, Straits Settlements, and the Philippine Islands suffered from a severe epidemic. A few cases occurred in Japan, and also at Shanghai, Foochow and Hong Kong. The following Table gives a list of the vessels arriving at Gravesend reporting that cases of Cholera had occurred during the voyage, and so were technically infected according to the Regulation of the Local Government Board relating to Plague, Yellow Fever and Cholera. In each instance full particulars were sent to the Local Government Board:— TABLE V. (Cholera.) Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry, and Official Number. Where from. Number of Cases.

There is little to remark respecting this disease beyond the fact that it continues endemic in those places in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes recognised as its special habitat, and where it is sufficiently deadly. In Brazil, Cuba, the States of Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica; at Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, San Domingo, and in French West Africa, this disease has been reported. Modern research, in exposing the probable origin and method of propagation of the disease by insect hosts, has indicated the lines for its suppression. The results so far are encouraging, Cuba, the home of this disease, having been free from the disease for nearly three years, until last year, when a few cases occurred, probably as a result of some relaxation of the stringent precautions in force during the previous years. Two cases of this disease were reported by the Master of a vessel arriving at Gravesend. The patients had been removed to hospital at Buenos Ayres, and the vessel thoroughly disinfected there. All persons being well on arrival at Gravesend, no further precautions were necessary. As the vessel was technically infected, the facts were reported to the Local Government Board. TABLE VI.

During the year 1906 Plague continued its ravages throughout almost the whole world, but in India there is some evidence that the disease is diminishing in virulence. In 1905 there were notified in the Indian Empire about 1,000,000 cases of Plague. As an example of the virulence of this disease, the outbreak in the City of Poona may be mentioned—the population of which, with the cantonments, being nearly 150,000; of these, 9,000 persons were attacked, and 8,000 died during a period of about four months. 17 At Hong Kong there appear to have been about 1,000 cases, with 900 deaths. Plague also existed at Canton, Swatow, Foochow, and Amoy, and also in the Kwang Tcheou territory. Japan was also infected, but there was not any very extensive outbreak, with the exception of Formosa, where there appear to have been about 3,000 cases, with about 2,300 deaths. Other places infected were the Philippines, Straits Settlements, Singapore, Penang, Saigon in Cochin China, Bangkok in Siam. There were a few cases in Sydney, New South Wales, which were associated with an outbreak of the disease amongst rodents in that town. Cases occurred at Brisbane, Rockhampton, at Cairns and Queensland. In South Australia only a single imported case occurred at Adelaide. In Western Australia, at Fremantle, Geraldton and at Perth. Plague existed also in New Caledonia and Noumea. In South America Plague appears to have become endemic. Many places in Brazil suffered, especially Rio de Janeiro. In the Argentine Republic a few cases occurred at Buenos Ayres and San Nicolas. In Peru and Chili several localities were infected. Plague also occurred in Russia, in the government of Astrakhan and a few other places, but there has been no outbreak in Western Europe. In Africa, Egypt suffered more from Plague in 1906 than in 1905, the towns particularly invaded being Alexandria, Port Said and Suez. In South Africa the disease was discovered amongst rats and mice in several localities. A valuable Report has been issued by the Advisory Committee appointed jointly by the Secretary of State for India, the Royal Society, and the Lister Institute. Elaborate experiments were carried out on a large scale, and it appears to be definitely proved that the infection may be spread by means of the flea which exists on the rat. No cases of actual or suspected Plague were brought into the Port of London. 18 Eight ships arrived which were technically infected—particular of these appear in the following Table:— TABLE VII.

Total 9 The French Government issued a Decree dated 4th May, 1906, containing Regulations for the destruction of rats on ships coming from ports infected with Plague. "Article I.—The destruction of rats exclusively practised by means of "an apparatus whose efficiency has been recognised by the Superior "Council of Public Health of France, is compulsory before admission into "French ports in the case of (a) Every ship coming from a port considered "as 'infected' with Plague, or having made call there, (b) Every ship "having taken on board more than 50 tons of merchandise coming directly "from a country considered as 'infected' with Plague." The Regulations are applicable to ships having already discharged the whole of their cargo in one or more foreign ports. "Article II.—The destruction of rats can be dispensed with in the "following instances :— "1. Ships which have landed passengers in a French port without "accoster ' and making, therefore, only a stay of a few hours. "2. Ships making a call of less than twelve hours, and discharging "less than 500 tons of merchandise. "Article IV.—The destruction of rats can be carried out during the "voyage by every French vessel having on board a medical officer, and "provided with an apparatus as mentioned in the first article." This same regulation is applicable to foreign vessels, provided they carry a medical officer of the same standing as French vessels are required to do, and the apparatus used be the same as that in the first Article. "Article V.—In ports, the destruction of rats is to be carried out before "the vessel is discharged." These Regulations are much more stringent than those in force in this country, where the official destruction of rats is only required when Plague has occurred either in persons or in rats on board ship, and may be done either before or after the discharge of cargo. 19 TABLE VIII.

The number of cases of Small-pox reported and dealt with on vessels during the year was above the average for the previous five years. Thirty-one cases in all were reported, whereas the average for the period referred to is 30.8. This number is the highest since 1902, when the disease was prevalent in London, and 93 cases were reported. A full list is given in the Table following, from which it will be seen that the disease occurred almost entirely on vessels which had arrived from or called at Indian ports and ports on the Persian Gulf. Other cases were derived from South Africa and Spain, and one occurred on a steamer which plies between London and Newcastle-on-Tyne. As a result of the prevalence of this disease in the East, I thought it desirable to issue to shipowners a circular, as follows:— "23rd February,1906. "In consequence of cases of Small-pox having occurred on several "vessels homeward bound from Eastern ports, and with a view to "preventing the introduction of that disease into this country, I have to "recommend to your notice the following suggestions:— "That all members of the crews of your vessels trading with Indian "ports that have not had Small-pox, or have not been recently "successfully re-vaccinated, say within five years, should be re-vaccinated "at the port of departure before embarking on the vessel. "That a supply of lymph should be carried on board, and in the event "of a case of Small-pox occurring during the voyage, any person on "board not protected by recent vaccination or Small-pox should be "re-vaccinated. "I urge this, not only in the interests of public health in this country, "but also with a view to shipowners avoiding the delay and expense which "is entailed by the presence of infectious disease on board their vessels." The terms of the circular met with prompt co-operation on the part of the principal shipowners. During June, a communication was received from the Secretary to the Local Government Board enclosing some correspondence which had been received from the Town Clerk of Newcastle-on-Tyne, in which it was alleged that Small-pox had been introduced into Newcastle from a vessel viâ the Port of London. 21 The facts were as follows:—The s.s. "Ninian Stuart" arrived at Gravesend from Huelva on the 6th May last, and was visited by an officer of H.M. Customs, accompanied by one of the Assistant Medical Officers of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. In reply to the usual questions put by the Customs Officer, the Master stated that all were well on board, and there had been no sickness or death during the voyage. Huelva was not a port infected with Plague, Yellow Fever, or Cholera, so the vessel was not boarded by the Assistant Medical Officer on duty at Gravesend. Moreover, it was not known that Small-pox existed in that port, and as the answers of the Master to the questions proved satisfactory, the vessel was allowed to proceed to her berth. Subsequent enquiry showed that, on the 3rd May, one of the crew had complained to the Master of being unwell, but the Master was unable to find anything the matter with him. This man left the ship on arrival in London, where he was paid off, and proceeded to Newcastle, so that he could not have felt really ill. Up to this time the appearance of the man had not caused any suspicion in the minds of those who had seen him that he was suffering from any infectious disease. He duly arrived in Newcastle, and on the 10th May was removed from his residence to hospital suffering from Small-pox. The facts were laid before the City Solicitor, who, in the absence of any evidence that the Master knew that the man was suffering from an infectious disorder, was not satisfied that there had been any breach of the bye-laws, and therefore did not advise a prosecution. This case simply serves to illustrate the difficulty that exists in dealing with imported Small-pox. It is one that arises from time to time, and is one for which, at present, there is apparently no practical remedy. The detention of every vessel arriving from a foreign port, and the detailed medical inspection of every person on board, is not, at present, within the power of Port Sanitary Authorities in this country. The powers of the Port of London Sanitary Authority are practically the same as those existing in the port of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and it would have been more discreet had the Authorities of Newcastle-on-Tyne enquired as to the practice pursued in their own port, before alleging neglect of duty on the part of the officer of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. The facts as above were communicated to the Local Government Board, and the incident ended there. 22 TABLE IX. (Small-pox.) Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official No. Where from.

A serious outbreak of Scarlet Fever occurred on the training ship "Arethusa," lying in the River Thames off Greenhithe. On the 20th September the Medical Officer of the ship reported that cases of Scarlet Fever had occurred on board, and on visiting the ship it was found that four boys were suffering from the disease, two of the boys having been taken ill on the 17th and two on the 20th of that month. The boys had been removed to the Isolation Hospital at Dartford, and I advised that no persons should be allowed to visit the ship from the shore pending developments of the outbreak. On the 24th September notifications were received of three more cases, two of which were removed to the Isolation Hospital at Dartford, and later on one was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton. On my visit I found that means of isolation were practically non existent; the boys, as they became ill, were placed in the fore part of the 'tween decks, and separated from the other occupants by palings through which those boys in the isolation place were distinctly visible. The remainder of the deck was occupied as a sleeping place by about half the boys. It therefore became obvious that all those boys must be treated as contacts, as they had been exposed to the risk of contracting the infection. This settled in the negative the question whether to send the boys to their homes, as this would have meant the dissemination of the disease in various parts of London and in the country. On discussing the matter with the Commander, and pointing out the necessity of promptly isolating and removing to hospital the cases of suspicious symptoms, I was informed that the hospital at Dartford could not take any more cases, and that a cottage on shore was the only means of isolating efficiently any further cases that might occur. I suggested to him that he should make arrangements with the Metropolitan Asylums Board to take any further cases which might arise. These negotiations failed, and the Commander then requested that the Port Sanitary Authority would take any further cases that might occur, into their hospital at Denton, otherwise he saw no possibility of getting them treated in hospital. 24 Finally it was agreed to take a limited number of cases into the hospital of this Authority at Denton, on the condition that reasonable out-of-pocket expenses should be paid. The epidemic continued, and the limited number which the hospital at Denton could receive having been reached, it became necessary to make the lower deck of the ship into a hospital and treat the boys there as they became ill. In all, 31 cases occurred from the 20th September to the 27th October, when the epidemic subsided. Occasional cases, however, continued to occur. Thus, from the 28th October to the 24th November there were 5 cases, following which there was a recrudescence of the epidemic, 14 cases occurring between the 24th November and the 31st December, making a total of 70. The ships each contain from 200 boys upwards, all of an age which renders them liable and susceptible to contract the various infectious diseases. In some cases arrangements have been made to isolate cases of infectious disease as they occur, but the "Arethusa" has hitherto only provided a small cottage on shore where four or five boys at the most can be received. I append for the information of your Worshipful Committee a list of the training ships moored in the River Thames, and the arrangements made for dealing with cases of infectious disease arising thereon. In 1901 this question came before your Worshipful Committee in respect of an outbreak of Diphtheria on the training ship "Warspite," and the three training ships stationed at Greenhithe were communicated with by your Worshipful Committee, and recommended to combine and erect and maintain a common hospital for the treatment of cases of infectious disease. Two of these vessels preferred to erect and maintain their own hospitals, and the scheme fell through. I quote from my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1901, in which I stated: "I am convinced that the proposal would have been the "best solution of the difficulty, as it must be borne in mind that with a "number of boys congregated together, all of an age particularly liable to "contract infectious disease, it is probable that an epidemic may occur with "which the present means are incapable of dealing." 25 The arrangements made by training ships moored in the River Thames for isolating cases of infectious disease are:— "Worcester," moored off Greenhithe - Hospital accommodation provided on shore. "Warsfite," ditto Ditto. "Arethusa," ditto A small cottage provided on shore, sufficient to accommodate four or five cases. "Exmoutb," moored off Grays Cases removed to politan Asylums Board's Hospitals. "Cornwall," moored off Purfleet A small hospital provided on shore, and cases are also removed to Wennington Hospital. The question of providing adequate accommodation for the isolation of cases of infectious disease which might arise on training ships is one which has been before the Port Sanitary Committee on previous occasions. It is practically impossible to ensure the satisfactory isolation of actual or suspected cases of infection on board such vessels, with a result that the disease soon spreads and becomes uncontrollable, especially as the boys on board are of an age which renders them peculiarly liable to contract infectious disease. These ships contribute nothing towards the expenses of the Port Sanitary Authority, and it is not reasonable to expect that sufficient hospital accommodation should be maintained for the treatment of a large outbreak of infectious disease on such ships. The accommodation allowed on board would not be tolerated on shore, and in my opinion the time has come to consider the desirability of abolishing these vessels and of erecting suitable buildings on shore with recreation grounds and adequate hospital accommodation for the treatment of cases of infectious disease. I would exempt H.M.S. "Worcester." This vessel is used as a nautical school for boys intending to enter the Mercantile Marine as officers. The occupation is not constant, the cadets having regular terms for work and vacations for holiday; and a large house on shore, standing in its own grounds, has been taken and fitted up as a hospital where three separate diseases can be isolated, and accommodation exists there for 50 boys in all, which should suffice for the needs of any ordinary epidemic of infectious disease. 26 TABLE X.

During the year a small epidemic of Enteric Fever occurred on the training ship "Cornwall," which is moored off Purfleet in the River Thames, and used for the reception and maintenance of boys from reformatory schools, the number on board being 255 on January 1st, 1906. The vessel is moored in an attractive position near the North bank of the River, where the tide ebbs and flows strongly twice in each twenty-four hours, but the sewage effluent from the London County Council's main drainage system is discharged at Crossness and Barking, a distance of five and seven miles respectively above the ship's position, whilst about 300 yards above the vessel the effluent from the septic tank of a small military station situated on the shore is discharged into the River, and the waste water from several houses on the riverside discharge in the immediate vicinity. The amount of the latter is inconsiderable. I was informed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district that there had been no case of Enteric Fever amongst the soldiers in the small military station above referred to, neither had there been any cases even suspicious of Enteric Fever amongst the inhabitants of the village of Purfleet. 28 Water Supply:—The drinking water supply is obtained from the shore by means of a flexible pipe, which was renewed less than three years ago, through which the water is received into a tank on board the vessel, from whence it is distributed throughout the ship. The tank was thoroughly cleaned out about two months ago, and the hose on being overhauled,was found to be in good order. A sample of this water has been analysed, and I give herewith a copy of the certificate given by Dr. F. L, Teed, F.I.C., the City Analyst:— 9, Mincing Lane, London, E.C., February 9th, 1906.

Not knowing the history of the water I cannot say whether any of the constituents vary from the normal for such water. FRANK L. TEED. In the early part of the year 1903 there was an outbreak of Enteric Fever amongst the boys on this ship, numbering in all sixteen cases, which was attributed to blankets purchased at second-hand which had been used in the Concentration Camps of South Africa, and some of which blankets were found, on bacterioscopic examination, to be stained with urine and fæecal matter, which furnished almost pure cultures of the Bacillus Typhosus. Since then the following cases of Enteric Fever have been notified:— 1903, August 13th - Enteric Fever. October 22nd Do. 1904 None. 29  Name. Ailed. Isolated in Hospital.

C. - ” 16 ” 16 Food:There are no shellfish, such as oysters, cockles or mussels, known to exist in the vicinity, or even to be obtainable by purchase in the neighbourhood, but the boys have been seen to eat biscuits and other foodstuffs which they had taken out of the river water; neither the names of the boys doing this were known, nor could they be identified with the boys who were ill. No eatables of any kind have been allowed to be sent to the boys from their friends for the past six months. Bedding.—The boys sleep in hammocks, wear flannel Nightshirts, and are covered with blankets, no sheets being provided. These blankets are stated to be sent to a steam laundry to be washed about once in every four months, or three times a year. Each boy occupies at night the same hammock, which is always slung from the same hooks, he uses the same blankets, which are marked with his name or number, and I am informed that an officer makes an occasional tour of inspection in order to ascertain that the boys are using their own blankets, and sleeping in their own hammocks, but it has been known that a boy occasionally has stolen blankets from another boy. The hammocks are slung at 8 p.m., and unslung at 6 a.m., when the whole of the bedding is stowed away after being tied up, with the exception of that of a few of the boys who are subject to nocturnal incontinence of urine. These are slung up in the open air to dry every morning. 30 The whole of the bedding is aired at least once a week, when it is slung up in the open air on the upper deck, and is never hung up in the sleeping or living quarters. The blankets, when removed for disinfection, were found to be apparently clean. No second-hand blankets have been purchased. Milk.—The milk supplied comes from one source, namely, a farm situated about one mile from the ship. The milk is brought in sealed cans to the ship. The Medical Officer to the ship, who is also the Medical Officer of Health for the district, informs me that the farm buildings are in a good sanitary state, that the cows drink apparently good water, and that there has been no history of any suspicious illness at the farm, or amongst any of the persons employed thereon; he also states that many families in the neighbourhood have been supplied with milk from the same farm, and that there has been no sickness occurring in members of these families. Sanitary Conveniences.—The closets used by the boys consist of a trough of glazed earthenware, fitted with nine seats, which with a urinal discharges by means of a soil pipe into the River at the water's edge. The soil pipe is continued upwards and acts as a ventilator, and there is also a trough closet and urinal for use at night on the upper deck. The troughs are flushed by means of an automatic tank which discharges automatically sixty gallons of water every thirty-five minutes. The floor is cemented, with a suitable gradient towards an opening, and is always kept in good and cleanly condition. Carbolic acid is used to flush down the closets every day; and since the early part of December, I am informed by the Medical Officer, the closet seats have been washed down three times a day and the place thoroughly flushed out with a solution of carbolic acid. It will be seen from the above tabulated list of cases that a boy (E. B.) who had been away on leave, ate some cockles on August Bank Holiday. He returned to the ship, ailed on August 21st, and suffered with Enteric Fever until September 17th. When he was discharged from Hospital he returned to the ship, and remained there until he went on leave at Christmas time. 31 H.M. ... ailed on November 27th. G. G. ” „ December 5th. R. E. „ „ „ 14th. *C. E. „ „ „ 15th. C. F. ” January 11th. W. E. „ „ „ 27th. * This boy bad been in Hospital for six weeks with ear disease, and was in all probability infected there. In the opinion of the Medical Officer of the ship all these cases were genuine Typhoid Fever, several of them having a large crop of definite ”rose-coloured" spots. Between October 30th and December 14th there were three boys suffering from prolonged Diarrhoea, but in neither case was there any rise of temperature, and in one boy who died the post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death as due to Tubercular Peritonitis. To sum up, this small outbreak, consisting of several consecutive cases, is obviously not due to water or milk, or there would have been several boys infected at the same time, and Enteric Fever would probably have occurred amongst the families on shore supplied with milk from the same source, whilst the analysis of drinking water would probably have shown some evidence of organic pollution. All the sewage is discharged overboard, and there is no connection with any sewer, and the closets, &c., are kept clean and in good order. No shellfish appear to have been obtainable in the neighbourhood, and although boys are stated to have eaten food stuffs picked out of the River, these boys cannot be identified with those taken ill with Enteric Fever, although it is possible that they might have been infected from this source. There was no Enteric Fever existing in the vicinity, and the boys were not allowed ashore. We have, therefore, the following facts to reason from. E. B., after ailing with Enteric Fever for one month, was allowed to return to the ship. It is well established that patients, even when convalescent from Enteric Fever, may retain the poison for many months afterwards either in their urine or intestinal tract, and a slight soiling of the blankets of E. B. would constitute them a potential source of infection. 32 The blankets vised by the boys are only washed once in four months, and it is possible that some of B.'s blankets might have been voluntarily or involuntarily exchanged with those of other boys, or that organisms of Enteric Fever might have blown from E. B.'s blankets to those of other boys during the weekly process of airing, and as H. M. was discharged on January 15th, the cases occurring after February 1st might have been infected by him. One case, C.E., was definitely infected in Hospital. The outbreak pointed to the source of infection being on the ship, and although this could not be definitely traced, the suspicion pointed to its being due to some articles of bedding which had in some way or other become infected accordingly. All the bedding, clothing and effects, in all 767 bundles, were removed to Denton Hospital on February 5th, where they were disinfected by means of steam ; on the same day the ship was thoroughly washed down inside with a solution of "Cyllin," the water tanks were cleaned out, and the bilges and sanitary conveniences disinfected. The fresh-water hose was overhauled and found to be in good order. Although four cases have been reported since February 5th, two of them were first noticed ailing on February 4th, and as the incubation period of this disease is roughly about 14 days, the other two boys were probably infected previous to that date, so that the outbreak ceascd as soon as all the bedding had been disinfected. I have pointed out that persons, even when convalescent, may retain the organisms of Enteric Fever within their body for some considerable time, and are, therefore, a potential source of danger, and I represented to the Captain and Medical Officer that the period of convalescence should be prolonged as far as possible before the return of the boys to the ship, and that the blankets should be washed more frequently. Dr. Dunlop, the Medical Officer in charge of the ship, visited the boys and examined them daily, and at once isolated any boy who was at all ill, and in this way the majority of the cases were isolated from the very first day of the disease, a result not commonly attained in dealing with cases of Enteric Fever. I have to thank him for his cordial co-operation, also Captain Steele and the officers of the ship for the ready and willing assistance they rendered the officers of this Authority in dealing with the outbreak. 33 TABLE XII.

The Medical Officer of Health for the City for London reported during June that he had received information of an outbreak of Enteric Fever in West Ham, and that of 52 cases reported, 24 were found to have eaten cockles a short time before the onset of the illness. The majority of these cockles were stated to have been purchased from a dealer in Billingsgate Market, who had obtained his supplies from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. Some samples of these cockles were taken, which showed, on examination by Dr. Klein, that the majority of the cockles contained an abundance of organisms in a living state, and in consequence the Fishmongers' Company prohibited the sale in Billingsgate Market of cockles from Leigh. On June 28th I visited the locality where the cockles are usually collected. This place is situated on the Maplin Sands, nearly abreast of the Mouse Lightship, and about eight miles below Southend. The sand and water in that vicinity showed to the naked eye no evidence of sewage pollution. Samples of the cockles, sand and water from this locality were taken by an Inspector of the Fishmongers' Company in my presence, and submitted to Dr. Klein for bacterioscopic examination, together with some cockles which 36 had been steamed in my presence at Leigh; and by the courtesy of the Fishmongers' Company I herewith give his report:— "Nos. 272-279. "St. Bartholomew's Hospital, E.C. " July 31st, 1906. "Dear Mr. Towse, ”The result of the bacterioscopic analysis of the samples of Water, Mud and "Cooked Cockles, which were delivered here on Sunday last by Mr. Roberts, is "as follows:— Samples of Mud, Water and Cockles, Nos. 272-279, taken 28th July, 1906, from Maplins and Leigh. Sample No. 272 (a) Mud.—Taken from the Maplins at a point off Black Tail Spit. The mud was taken immediately below the surface, i.e., where the cockles are embedded. "Sample Mud A, Maplin Sands surface.—Has Spirilla (Sewage ?) " per c.c. "About 5,000 bacteria per 1 c.c. "B. coli per 1 c.c., not per 1/10 c.c. "No streptococci per 1 c.c. "No sporogenes per 10 c.c." Sample No. 273 (b) Mud.—This mud was taken within the same area as sample (a), but at a depth of about a foot. "Sample Mud B, Maplin Sands, 1 foot deep. "About 5,000 to 6,000 bacteria per 1 c.c. "No streptococci or spirilla per 1 c.c. "No sporogenes per 10 c.c. "Mud A has no growth per 1/20 c.c. Phenol broth. Mud B has growth per " 1/20 c.c. Phenol broth. "On the whole, I think neither Sample of Mud is bad, although Sample" Mud A might be, on account of the spirilla (supposing these are derived from "sewage), considered not so good as Sample Mud B." Sample No. 274 (a) Water.—This water was taken at a distance of about a hundred yards from whence the mud was taken and from near the surface. The tide had been flowing for about an hour. "Sample Water A, from Maplin Sands.—Very Good." 10 bacteria per 1 c.c. "No B. coli and no streptococci per 1 c.c. " No sporogenes per 10 c.c." 37 Sample No. 275 (b) Water.—This water was taken from a barrel in Meddle's Hut, Leigh. It was tap water, i.e., Leigh's drinking water. This water was put in the barrels for the purpose of washing cockles after cooking. " Sample Water B, from barrel in steaming shed.—Not Good. " 17,760 bacteria per 1 c.c. "B. coli per 1/20 c.c. "Streptococci per 1/20 c.c. "No sporogenes per 10 c.c." Sample No. 276 (a) Cockles.—Taken from the Maplins at a distance of about 300 yards from where mud and sample (a) water were obtained, thence taken to Leigh, where they were cooked by steam in oven for five minutes, at a pressure of about 25 lbs. "Cockles.—A.—Clean, sufficiently heated." Sample No. 277 (b) Cockles.—Taken from near the bed of the creek and within 200 yards of Leigh Sewage Works outfall. The cockles had been relaid in this creek for about ten days. The cockles were steamed in oven for five minutes at a pressure of about 25 lbs. "Cockles.—B.—Two of eight have B. coli, a third has coli-like microbe. "No streptos." Sample No. 278 (c) Cockles,—Taken from the same parcel as those constituting sample (a), but were subjected to 5½ minutes steaming at a pressure of about 25 lbs, "Cockles.—C.—One of eight has B. coli. No streptos." Sample No. 279 (d) Cockles.—Taken from the same parcel as those constituting sample (6), and were steamed for six minutes in oven at a pressure of about 25 lbs. "Cockles.—D.—One of eight has B. coli. No streptos. "Very truly yours, "E. KLEIN." Samples 272-279 inclusive were all placed in bottles supplied from Professor Klein's Laboratory. In January, 1903, I visited Leigh-on-Sea, and took samples of water, mud and cockles from Leigh Creek, and Dr. Klein reported then respecting:— A.—Water from Leigh Creek. B.—Mud from Leigh Creek. C.—Cockles from Leigh Creek. 38 "A.— Water.—This water contained at least ½-million microbes per 1 c.c. The "water contained abundance of bacillus coli communis and spores of bacillus "enteritidis sporogenes, of the latter at least 10 spores per 1 c.c., of the former at " least 100 per 1 c.c. "From this it follows that this water is practically dilute sewage. "B.—Mud.—1 gramme of mud was distributed in 10 c.c. of sterile water; after "allowing the mineral matter to settle, of the slightly turbid fluid c.c., ¼ c.c. "and 1 c.c. were used for demonstrating the presence of bacillus coli communis and "the spores of the bacillus enteritidis sporogenes, and the result was practically "the same as stated of the water, viz., abundance of bacillus coli communis and of " spores of bacillus enteritidis in c.c. "C.— Cockles.—Twelve of the cockles were used, only the exterior beinu; "employed. The result was this : All cockles contained the bacillus coli communis "and the spores of bacillus enteritidis. In one (possibly two) cockle we isolated, "besides, a microbe which, so far as was possible in the two days, answers to the "tests of typhoid bacillus, but, of course, this time is not sufficient to make a "definite statement on the subject. I may, however, add that typhoid blood "agglutinates the emulsion of the bacillus in question as 1 in 100, better, of course, "as 1 in 50. "E. KLEIN," Dr. Klein further reported that from the cockles "the typhoid bacillus, or at" any rate a bacillus corresponding to it and answering all the tests of the " bacillus typhosus, was discovered in them." I have no knowledge that any change has taken place in the nature or disposal of the sewage effluent at Leigh, so the above report may be taken as practically the same as exists at the present day. At that time the sale of cockles in Billingsgate Market was prohibited, and they were only allowed to be sold in the market again conditionally on their being steamed for a period of five minutes, and that no cockles should ever be re-laid in the Creek. I find that since Easter it has been the practice of the cockle fishermen to re-lay cockles in the Creek for period of two tides, say 24 hours, in order that they might purge themselves of the sand. The sewage effluent from Leigh pours into this Creek, and it is therefore evident that, while purging themselves of the sand, they fill themselves with sewage, contaminated water and mud from the Creek. When it is considered that large numbers of the working classes of London visit Southend, and a large proportion of them partake of cockles, and that, in addition to this, large quantities of cockles which have been insufficiently steamed are sent to Billingsgate, there to be sold in small quantities in different parts of the County of London, there is great danger to the public health arising from the re-laying of the cockles in the sewage-polluted water of Leigh Creek. 39 The Fishmongers' Company have very properly prohibited the sale of any cockles in Billingsgate Market which have been relaid in Leigh Creek. It has been said that the process of steaming renders the cockles quite free from danger when eaten, but this is not so, as the above bacteriological examination shows; and even if they were rendered sterile, cockles containing sterilised sewage in their interiors should not be allowed to be sold for human consumption. On my recommendation a circular letter was accordingly sent to each of the fishermen at Leigh, and an advertisement inserted in the local Press to the effect that no person shall deposit any shellfish in the water of Leigh Creek or the vicinity thereof, and that instructions have been given to the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London to seize and carry before a magistrate any shellfish so deposited, with a view to their being condemned, and legal proceedings will subsequently be taken against any person owning such shellfish, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. CAUTION. Sewage Polluted Shellfish. All persons are hereby warned against depositing any Shellfish in the water of Leigh Creek, or the vicinity thereof, having regard to its polluted state. The Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London has been directed by the Corporation of London, the Port Sanitary Authority, to seize and carry before a Magistrate, any Shellfish so deposited, with a view to the same being condemned and destroyed. Anyone acting in contravention of this Notice will be liable on summary conviction before a Magistrate to a fine not exceeding £50 for every parcel of Shellfish so condemned, or, at the discretion of the Court, without the infliction of a fine, to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, with or without hard labour. By Order of the Port Sanitary Authority. JAMES BELL, Guildhall, London, E.C., Town Clerk. September, 1906. An Inspector has visited Leigh Creek at intervals, and he reports that at no time has he seen any cockles being laid in the Creek, and as far as his observations went, the cockles now appear to be brought direct from the gathering grounds on the Maplin Sands and are cooked forthwith. 40 ERYSIPELAS. The total number of cases reported was seven, of which one was treated in the Port "Sanitary Hospital, and three were inmates of the Seamen's Hospital at Greenwich. TABLE XIII. (Erysipelas.) Date.

Total 7 MEASLES. ♦ Sixty-eight cases of this disease have been notified during the year. This is a considerable number, and is above the average for the Port. It will be seen, on reference to the Table, that a large proportion of these cases are due to an epidemic of this disease on the training ship "Worcester." where, as is usual when disease breaks out in any places where the inmates are of a susceptible age, all who have not previously suffered from the disease are attacked. Each case as it occurred was promptly isolated in the ship's hospital on shore, and this probably prevented the epidemic assuming larger proportions. The total number of cases was 39. Thorough measures of disinfection were adopted, and as soon as possible the boys were sent away, and the vessel thoroughly disinfected. 41 TABLE XIV. (Measles.) Date.

"Skjalm," from Archangel, which arrived at Gravesend on the 2nd November, and landed two of the crew at the Port Sanitary Hospital with Continued Fever. They were, however, subsequently discharged as not suffering from any infectious disease. There had been on this vessel a succession of cases of sickness, which were reported as Enteric Fever. They occurred as follows:— Taken ill. Removed to Hospital at. Chief Officer 12th September Barry, 18th September Second Mate 15 th ” Aalsund, 23rd ?? Seaman 23rd ” Tromsoe, 27th Cook 24th ” ” 27th ” Seaman 25th r Archangel, 7th October Second Mate 7th October ” 7th ” Fireman 8th ” ” 8th ” Pilot 17th ” Tromsoe, 21st ” Sailor 25th ” Aalsund, 26th ” Whatever the nature of the outbreak was, it seems to have closely resembled Enteric Fever, and may perhaps be attributed to the drinking of polluted water or some article of food. It may be noted that the vessel had been disinfected at each port where cases of sickness had been removed to hospital, and that the water tanks were specially steamed out and cleaned both at Archangel and Tromsoe. No further cases occurred during the stay of the vessel in London. 43 TABLE XV. (Continued Fever.) Date Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official Number. Where from. No. of Cases.

This disease was notifiable in the Port of London from 30th November, 1905, to 31st May, 1906. On the 7th February I received a message by telephone that there were some Lascars on the s.s. ''Bantu," of London, official number 114,778, from Antwerp, lying in the Royal Victoria Dock, who were suffering from an illness suspicious of Small-pox. I visited the vessel, and formed the opinion that they were suffering from Chicken-pox ; and, as there was no accommodation for isolating the men on board, they were removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital at Denton. On the 10th February three other cases were removed to the same hospital. The s.s. "Clan Stuart" arrived at Gravesend on the 21st April. 44 The vessel left Calcutta on the 7th March. On the 18th, a native greaser and a Lascar were landed at Chittagong, after examination by the Port Medical Officer, as suffering from symptoms suspicious of Small-pox. All the natives were bathed, and their effects and quarters disinfected before leaving. A Lascar who joined the ship at this port complained of headache on the 2nd April, that is, 14 days later, and a rash appeared on his face the same day. He was landed at Suez on the 6th April, and disinfection of the native quarters again carried out. A fortnight later, on the 19th, a deck tindal was taken ill with pains in back and other symptoms, the rash making its appearance next day. He was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital on the vessel's arrival at Gravesend on the 21st, where disinfection of all the native quarters, bedding and effects was carried out. In view of the history, precautions were adopted to prevent the spread of infection, the names and addresses of passengers and other persons leaving the vessel being taken and forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health for the districts to which they were going. This case was definitely Chicken-pox, and probably the previous cases were also of this nature. The series is of interest as showing how disease may be brought to this country by a vessel after a voyage of several weeks. These cases further illustrate the possibility of mistaking Chicken-pox for Small-pox, and it frequently happens that cases of modified Small-pox are diagnosed as Chicken-pox. This may lead to most dangerous consequences, and therefore it is wise at all times, when Small-pox is in any way prevalent, to include Chicken-pox as a notifiable disease. The total number of cases notified was 32, of which 25 were treated in the Port Sanitary Hospital. 45 TABLE XVI. (Chicken.pox.) Date. Name of "Vessel, Port of Registry, and Official Number.

The first patient was taken ill on February 20th, and was removed to the Seamen's Hospital on arrival of the vessel in London on the 21st, death taking place the same day. The second case was admitted on the 22nd, as Bronchial Pneumonia. In former times this disease was known as "Famine Fever," and is now practically unknown in this country. TABLE XVII.

On the 14th June, it was reported to me that a man had been admitted to the London Hospital suffering from Anthrax. He resided in Poplar, and had been employed in the St. Katharine's Dock loading hides into the s.s. " Alice," bound from London to Hull. These hides were ascertained to have gone from St. Olave's Wharf to St. Katharine's Dock in a van.

Particulars of each are given under the heading of the disease in question. The recurrence of such epidemics, as has been on several occasions pointed out, is more or less inevitable, in view of the environment and susceptible age of the inmates. TABLE XXII.

At a Court of Common Council held on 21st June, 1906, it was resolved: " That, having regard to recent legal decisions on the question of " sewage pollution, this Court is of opinion that the time has arrived when a " conference of the various Authorities interested in the subject of the " purification of the estuary of the River Thames, and elsewhere, should be " convened for the purpose of considering the existing situation, and with a " view to taking such action as should be deemed necessary in the interest of " the public health, and that it be referred to the Port of London Sanitary '' Committee to arrange and hold such conference accordingly." At a Meeting on the 18th September, 1906, of the Port Sanitary Sub. Committee, I was instructed to obtain evidence as to the extent of the pollution of the River Thames; River Med way and its estuary, either local or general; and further, to obtain information or evidence as to the pollution of the River within the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority. On considering the question, I decided that an opinion based upon the results obtained by chemical analysis, in preference to bacterioscopic examination, would answer the purpose and would cost much less. A series of samples of river water was taken and submitted to the City Analyst, Dr. F. L. Teed, F.I.C., and I append the results of his analyses on pages 50 and 51. Table XXIII., Part A., p. 50—Represents the analysis of samples of water taken from the River Thames in its course from Teddington Weir to nearly as far as the Nore, and the River Medway from Stangate Creek to Garrison Point. These samples, except No. 35, were taken during the last one and a half hours of the ebb tide, before the tide began to flow, and may therefore be considered, for the purposes of comparison, as having been taken under similar conditions of tide. Dr. Teed suggests, and I agree with him, that (for the purpose of comparing the various analyses) the figures shown under the heading of Free Ammonia (N H3) may be taken as indicating the degree of sewage pollution. It will be seen that the water passing over Teddington Weir shows evidence of considerable pollution, a fact not to be wondered at when it is considered that the sewage effluent from the houses of Kingston and Surbiton is discharged into the River above that point. 53 The evidence of the pollution of the River increases during its course as far as London Bridge, showing an increase of Free Ammonia from .068 grains per gallon at Teddington Weir to .195 grains per gallon at London Bridge, taken at the central arch. In this part of the River the effluent from the sewage works of Richmond, Kew and Sheen, discharges into the River as well as several storm outfalls from the main sewer of the London County Council, especially at Hammersmith and Blackfriars, which is a possible explanation of the increase of the pollution. At Greenwich the Free Ammonia falls to .102 grains per gallon, rising at Woolwich to .1445. At Greenhithe the sample shows a great increase in pollution, which is explained by the discharge of some two hundred and fifty millions (250,000,000) of gallons per day of sewage effluent at Barking and Crossness from the London County Council sewer outfalls. In connection with this I would refer to Table " A,'' Nos. 7-15, which shows the analysis of the effluent at Barking, and the result of the pollution of the River below that point. At Gravesend, the condition of the River has improved, and the evidence of pollution there is about the same as that of the River at Greenwich. The sample taken off the Chapman Lighthouse shows a great improvement, and agrees with the results of the analyses made and published in the Reports of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal. The effluent from Leigh is much more impure than that from Barking, and apparently more than that of Southend and Sheerness. These two latter could not be obtained in an undiluted condition at the outfall; they are mixed with sea water and show evidence of better condition. It will be remembered that it has, until recently, been the practice of the Leigh fishermen to lay down cockles in Leigh Creek, in the vicinity of the Leigh sewer outfall, and persons eating cockles from this place have subsequently developed Enteric Fever. An increase in the pollution below Southend Pier was obviously caused by the discharge of sewage from Southend, but a comparatively low figure is again reached about halfway between the West Middle and Shoebury Buoys, 54 Apparently there is much greater pollution on the Southend side than on the Sheerness side, as is shown by the sample between West and Middle Shoebury Buoy, 0.034, compared with sample taken one mile below Garrison Point Fort, 0'0035, but the former sample was taken in the track of the Southend effluent when it was at its maximum intensity. whereas the effluent from Sheerness at that time must have been small in quantity, and the degree of pollution not so great. Nos. 7-15, taken under similar conditions, represents the pollution due to the outfall of sewage effluent at Barking, and the condition of the water greatly improves from 2.099 to 0.536 one mile below the outfall. There is an outfall at Crossness which would have shown similar results, but for the purposes of this Report it was not deemed necessary to take samples at Crossness. Nos. 22.26 represents a series of samples. The first specimen was taken within three yards of the outfall of the Southend sewer. Crude sewage containing masses of human excrement was pouring out in great volume, and the odour given off was extremely offensive. The outfall could be located at a distance by the presence of a large number of seagulls feeding there, and in the vicinity by its appearance ; it was interesting to note that the solid constituents of the sewage floating in the water were being attacked by numerous living creatures of the crustacean type akin to the shrimp. The stream of sewage could be distinctly traced for nearly a mile by the scum visible upon the surface of the water as well as by floating human excrement. The samples of water were taken a foot below the surface, and it will be noted that the quantity of free ammonia diminishes from 1.079 to .034 halfway between West and Middle Shoebury buoys, and agree practically with the sample taken above the Southend outfall. Nos. 27.29 show the condition of the water in the Medway above the outfall of the Sheerness sewer at Minster. A sample taken 200 yards above the outfall shows .003, and at the outfall .019. This diminishes to .005 at Garrison Point, increases to .0065 below Garrison Point, which may be due to the pollution from Garrison Point Fort and Dockyards, and again improves lower down. 55 It is obvious here that the effluent from the outfall at the time could not have been at its maximum volume, for I have on a former occasion seen the discharge from the outfall when it was quite black and extremely offensive in smell. Table XXIII., part B.—Is intended to show the effect of the pollution of the Thames from the outfall at Barking, and the extent to which it extends up the River. No. 7 shows the analysis of the effluent taken at Barking, followed by a sample at low water at Woolwich, and at the same spot at two hours' flood, four hours' flood and high water. Samples were also taken at low water at Greenwich and high water at Greenwich, and at London Bridge four hours before high water, two hours before high water, and at high water. The samples taken at Woolwich show an increase of pollution from 0.1445 to .255. At Greenwich, from 0.102 to .272. At London Bridge, from 0.0765 to .170. These all show a greatly increasing pollution with the flood tide, showing that the pollution of the River at Barking and Crossness is brought up the River during the flood tide as far as London Bridge. General Conclusions. The chief sources of pollution are 1. The River water as it comes over Teddington Weir, polluted by the sewage effluent of Kingston and Surbiton. 2. Storm overflows of London County Council sewers. 3. Outfalls at Barking and Crossness—some 250,000,000 gallons daily. 4. Vessels and craft— Negligible. 5. Discharge from sewers at Gravesend. Military forts at Sheerness and elsewhere. Negligible. 6. Leigh.on.Sea. 7. Southend. 8. Sheerness and West Minster, into Medway. 9. Sewage from Rochester and Chatham entering the River Medway. There is, therefore, a considerable amount of sewage entering the River Thames and Medway, but the general conditions of the water in the Thames estuary within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority cannot be considered as being in a state of serious pollution. 56 No nuisance liable to be dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, can be said to exist, whilst the shellfish layings within the present jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority are few and comparatively unimportant. Samples taken one mile below the sewer outfalls of Southend and Sheerness respectively show no evidence of gross pollution with sewage. This is mainly due to the inevitable large dilution with sea water, but the effluent discharged at Barking and Crossness oscillates with each flow and ebb of the tide, even as high as London Bridge, and as the amount discharged is so great and of increasing quantity, it is important that the latest scientific results should be employed there to purify the effluent to as great an extent as is possible. The Southend.on. Sea Corporation have introduced a Bill into Parliament for powers to construct new sewerage works at an estimated cost of 150,000/. I understand this will include the removal of the grosser impurities by means of a series of screens, and consequently the discharge into the sea of a much purer effluent than is done at present. The Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal have not yet reported as to the best method of purifying sewage effluent, whether for discharge into rivers, or tidal waters, obviously a lesser degree of purity is required where it is intended to discharge sewage into tidal waters than in the case of rivers, inasmuch as in the latter case the sources of drinking water supply may be polluted. It has been estimated that the Thames, from its source to Teddington Weir, receives the sewage effluent of nearly a million persons. Enquiries were made of the Masters of the picturesque eel boats which lie off Billingsgate Market as to what they thought of the condition of the River. They state that their impression is that the water in that locality is not in such good condition as formerly. Ten years ago they were able to keep their eels alive in the river water from October to May inclusive, but now they can only do so from December to April. Even during the winter the condition of the water varies as shown by its effect on the eels, being injurious in dry weather and the reverse after heavy rain. The Public Bodies concerned in the purification of tidal waters within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority are the Conservators of the River Thames and Med way respectively. These bodies have special Acts of Parliament which give them special powers for dealing with the discharge of sewage effluent into the rivers and tributaries within their jurisdiction, whereas the Port of London Sanitary Authority can only deal with such under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 57 The figures showing the amount of salt present in the River Thames at various localities are interesting. It should be borne in mind that the greater proportion of the salt used or misused in households, &c., finds its way into the sewer, and thence into the River. At Teddington there are 3.13 grains of common salt in each gallon ; this gradually increases to 15.35 per gallon at London Bridge, and 38'89 grains at Woolwich at low water, 1,216 grains at Greenhithe, 1,495 grains at Gravesend, 2,064 grains at the Chapman Lighthouse near the lower end of Canvey Island, and 2,252 grains at the Nore at high water, which may be taken as the usual amount in sea water. As would be expected, the amount increases with the flood tide :— At London Bridge, from 15.35 to 68.21. „ Greenwich, „ 15.59 „ 178.78. „ Woolwich, ,, 38.89 „ 362. It is not likely that any water from the sea reaches as high as London Bridge, and the increase is probably due to the salt in the sewage effluent from Barking being brought up on the flood tide. In relation to this matter, the question arose as to whether certain of His Majesty's vessels moored in the estuary of the Medway do not contribute substantially to the pollution of that estuary, and in particular a vessel on vessels moored in the mouth of Stangate Creek, there being in another portion of the same creek certain oyster beds or layings. I accordingly visited the spot, and by the courtesy of the officer commanding H.M.S. " Actteon," was allowed to inspect the arrangements for the disposal of sewage, garbage and slop water from the vessels forming the Torpedo School. At the time of my visit, the number of officers and men living on board the School Ship numbered about 250 in all. I found that the discharge of soil, &c., from the heads and urinals, went direct into the River, and that a man was specially detailed to supervise this arrangement, and his duty was to see that the troughs receiving the drainage were only emptied into the River during the first two hours of the ebb tide. It was also evident that the accommodation was sufficient for the temporary storage of the sewage during the flood tide, and that the arrangement was a perfectly safe and reasonable one. Slop water from the kitchens, garbage, &c., was thrown into a shoot at the side of the vessel, at the bottom of which shoot was a grating. The grating stopped the solid garbage which, with the ashes from the ship, was once a week collected in a dirt boat and sent ashore. The garbage would be collected oftener than once a week if required, the ship being provided with a special boat for the purpose. 58 As the tide runs out of Stangate Creek at the rate of about 1½to 2 miles an hour, and the distance from H.M.S " Actæon" to Garrison Point is 21 miles, if the sewage is discharged from the vessel during the first two hours of the ebb tide, there should be time during the remainder of the ebb for the whole to pass quite clear of the River Medway—certainly there appears to be little danger of any returning to Stangate Creek. The closets used by the officers and petty officers, numbering eight in all, were, as is usual, discharged into the River as often as used, and this would be comparatively unimportant. UNSOUND FOOD. The year 1906 was not remarkable for any abnormal seizures of unsound food. The total quantities are shown in Table XXIV., and the quantities generally are less than in the previous year, with the exception of " Wet Fish," of which a larger quantity than usual was seized and destroyed. An Inspector, on looking through the cargo of a steamer which had arrived from Singapore, observed that there were 48 cases, each case containing 100 tins of sardines. It was obvious that these articles of food were not ordinary imports from Singapore, but had been returned for some unusual reason. The examination revealed the fact that the contents of the tins were unsound and unfit for human food. The facts were brought to the notice of the owners, who asked that they might be allowed to inspect them with a person who was described as an expert. Facilities were afforded them, and they expressed the opinion that the tins were a little " slack," but still perfectly good. I personally examined the contents of four cases without finding a single good tin amongst the 400 examined, and therefore I notified the owners that it was my intention to carry the sardines before a Magistrate with a view to having them condemned under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The owners requested that they might take samples for submission to an Analyst with a view to refuting my evidence before the magistrate. 59 They were allowed to do this, but twelve hours before the time fixed for taking them to the Police Court they communicated with me, asking that the sardines might be destroyed, stating that the report of their Analyst was not so favourable as they had anticipated. It is clear, but for the action of the Food Inspector, the whole of this consignment would have been manipulated in some way and sold again for the food of man. Large quantities of boned meat and casks of sausage meat continue to be imported. This has been examined carefully, but no evidence has been found which would indicate that this meat was otherwise than sound, and, in consequence, it has been allowed to go for human consumption. The carcasses of animals killed in the country or imported as such are rigorously inspected, and if found diseased or unsound, are seized and destroyed. In the case of meat cut up into small pieces no guarantee can be obtained that it has not come from animals the subject of disease in some form or other, and certainly a large loophole exists here for the importation of the flesh of diseased animals, or even of animals not usually eaten by human beings in this country. An unusual seizure was recently made in the Royal Victoria Dock of twelve turtles which were found to be dead, and unfit for the food of man. They were accordingly seized and destroyed in the usual manner. Large quantities of " renovated " butter continue to be imported ; it is almost certain that this consists of butter which has become rancid, then treated chemically to remove the rancidness, and subsequently churned with fresh milk and exported to this country. I had samples taken of one of the first consignments which entered the Port of London, but the report of the Analyst did not justify my taking any further action. On the 21st September last an Inspector discovered 14 cases containing tinned goose livers, which had been landed in the St. Katharine's Dock. The goods were consigned to the order of a firm of carriers. On inspecting them, it was found that a large percentage of the tins were blown and full of gas, and that the top and bottom of the tins were quite convex, and that it was impossible to indent them by pressure. On communicating with the firm of carriers, it was ascertained that the owner of the goods lived in Austria, and at their request the usual proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were put in abeyance until they could communicate with the owner. 60 He subsequently appointed a firm of merchants in London to act as his representatives, and they were requested to sort the contents of the cases under the supervision of an officer of this Authority, and to hand over the unsound tins for the purpose of destruction. This they declined to do, alleging that the goods were perfectly sound and fit for human food. They were then notified that the unsound goods would he taken before a Magistrate with a view to having them condemned, and on hearing this, the owner's representatives consented to have the goods sorted as directed. The result was that 1,388 tins were found blown and unfit for human food, and were destroyed in the presence of an Inspector of this Authority. Application was made by the owner's representatives to be allowed to return these goods to Austria, but it was felt that foodstuffs which were unsound and unfit for the food of the inhabitants of this country, were likewise unfit for the food of the inhabitants of any other country, and furthermore, there was the possibility of the contents being sterilised, re.tinned, and again exported to this country, so that the only safe course was to have them destroyed in this Port. It has been necessary to keep a careful watch upon tinned foodstuffs coming into the Port from various places, which appear to have been purchased at various times at sales in South Africa, Avhen surplus army stores were disposed of. These goods do not always arrive direct from South Africa, neither is the date of their purchase from the Government known, so that whatever their condition may have been at the time of sale, it is usual, on examination, to find a quantity unfit for human food. A point of some interest arose from the fact that these goods were entered in as " Government Stores." From this description on the bills of entry it might be inferred that the goods were stores the property of the Government, and as such, outside the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority. Investigation showed, of course, that this was not so, but that the stuff was private property, having been previously purchased from the Government. Of this class of goods, on the 7th December 42 tins of sardines were seized, and on 20th December 1,750 tins of beef essence ; these were all destroyed. 61 A most interesting inquiry and investigation has been made by Dr. Buchanan, of the Local Government Board, into the question of the condition at the present time of beef essence which had been prepared several years ago and sent to South Africa during the war, and a Report has been issued from which it would appear that large consignments of this substance have been found at certain ports, not London, where it had been landed from South Africa during the year. Most of this beef extract was packed in tins, but some in glass bottles. On examining the stuff there appeared to be no question of unsoundness in connection with either of the materials used in enclosing the beef essence. The essence had been manufactured by different English firms, and most, as already stated, was in sealed tins. The examination of the consignment, of course, exposed a certain proportion of " blown " tins, but the samples—the subject of the investigation—did not include any tins of this description. The point about the tins which attracted most attention was that the contents appeared to be quite fluid, which condition was confirmed on opening the tins, whereas new samples consisted of a firm mass of jelly. Again, further samples were clear and amber.coloured, whereas the contents of the tins in question were turbid and dirty.looking. Bearing in mind the fact that beef essence is probably often used for administration to invalids, and in acute and severe illnesses, as a nourishing stimulant, it appeared very probable that the change which had obviously taken place in the constitution of beef essence were such as to render the material quite unsuitable for that purpose. The result of the enquiries was to show that the material change which had taken place in the essence was due not to bacteriological processes, but to metallic contamination from the interior of the tins The essence had dissolved tin from the receptacle, and the turbidity of the essence was due to the subsequent precipitation of tin in organic combination. The quantity of metallic tin present in the samples was such as to render it extremely probable that poisoning might result from partaking of the same, and the conclusion arrived at was that the deterioration had taken place rom the essence being kept in a tinned receptacle for too long a period. 62 The importation of frozen mutton and lamb into the Port of London continues to increase in amount. During the year 1906 the following quantities arrived :— London. No. of carcasses. Other Ports. No. of Carcasses. Australia 1,339,677 392,651 New Zealand . 3,818,506 329,782 South America 932,986 1,986,290 6,091,169 2,708,723 It will be noted that the greater proportion of the frozen mutton and lamb from Australia and New Zealand came into the Port of London, whilst that from South America went chiefly to Liverpool and other ports. The arrangements for keeping the meat at a low temperature have been much improved, and it is only occasionally, when some defect in these arrangements occurs, that the meat on examination is found to be unsound. The bulk of the meat arrives in first.class condition, as is shown by the fact that only 4,279 carcasses of mutton, and 844 quarters of beef have been found unfit for food during the year as a result of unsoundness, and not a single carcass has been seized on account of disease. The greatest difficulty has been experienced in regard to the preservation of chilled beef, which requires very careful management. It has been suggested the meat should be exposed to the action of oxygen or carbonic acid gas before shipment, it being maintained that meat so treated can undergo a larger variation of temperature during the voyage without undergoing deterioration. The first shipments of meat thus treated will be inspected with interest. Special attention has been given to the inspection of railway wagons, horsed vans and lighters used for the conveyance of meat, with the result that many of them have been found to be in an unsatisfactory condition. In each instance the owners have been communicated with, and in every case instructions have been given that the vans and lighters are to be regularly and systematically cleansed. On December 31st, 1906, there were 172 steamers fitted with refrigerating machinery and engaged in the frozen meat trade, and capable of carrying 11,594,000 carcasses. Some of these vessels can each carry 150,000 carcasses, a larger number than was brought in any one year until 1890. The following Table, from Messrs. Weddel and Company's 19th Annual Review of the Frozen Meat Trade, will illustrate the great growth of the importation of frozen mutton and lamb into the Port of London and other ports :— Year.

During the year 1906, a Bill to amend the Merchant Shipping Act was introduced into Parliament, and was referred by the Court of Common Council to the Port Sanitary Committee to report thereon. The Bill, after being read a second time in the House of Commons, was referred to the Standing Committee on Trade. The Bill, as originally drafted, contained no provision for amending the original Act of 1894, so as to increase the cubical capacity and superficial area for seamen, and also for improving in other ways the conditions under which seamen have to live. I duly reported this to the Port Sanitary Committee, and I was instructed to submit a list of my recommendations, which were approved, and Mr. Remembrancer took the necessary steps to have them brought to the notice of the Standing Committee on Trade. My recommendations were as follows :— (1) Plans, drawn to scale, and specifications of all living quarters and sanitary conveniences on board every new ship, must be submitted to a Port Sanitary Authority for approval. This should preferably be the Port Sanitary Authority of the port in which the vessel is built. No new vessel shall be considered to comply with the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act unless and until the inhabited spaces and sanitary conveniences have been inspected and certified by an Officer of a Port Sanitary Authority as being satisfactory. (2) The minimum of cubic space should be raised to at least 120 cubic feet per head. (3) The superficial floor space should be at least 18 square feet per head. (4) The ventilation should be efficient, and not merely mean the provision of a ventilator situated in an unsuitable position. (5) The lighting to be adequate. No bunks shall be allowed to be placed in such a position as to obstruct the light. (6) A separate room should be provided for the crews to take their meals in. (7) All bare iron surfaces in living quarters shall be efficiently insulated. 66 (8) Heating and Cooking Stoves. Cooking stoves should not be permitted in inhabited spaces, and heating stoves, where used, should be so constructed, and with efficient flues, so as to prevent the escape, into any inhabited space, of noxious or injurious fumes or gases. (9) The fore part of steamers is an unsuitable place for the berthing of crews, and where possible they should be berthed aft. No alteration shall be made in any living quarters after registration unless with the consent and approval of a Port Sanitary Authority, preferably the Sanitary Authority who originally inspected the vessel before registration. Sir Gilbert Parker, M.P. for Gravesend, moved a new clause before the Standing Committee on Trade, which proposed to amend the principal Act so as to provide that the minimum space in the sleeping compartment on board ship should be 120 cubic feet per head, in place of 72 cubic feet, and the superficial space should be 18 instead of 12 feet. He also proposed a new sub.section enacting that, where practicable, accommodation for seamen or apprentices should be provided in the after part of the ship, and a separate room set apart for the crew's meals. He pointed out that if 72 cubic feet were to be accepted as the standard of comfort of seamen, then we had a standard lower than that provided for criminals and cattle. The cubical capacity proposed, namely 120 cubic feet, was practically one. third of that which was already provided in factories, lodging.houses and military barracks, and it was the least that ought to be granted. He also pointed out that it was impossible to give the same light and ventilation in the fore part of the ship as would be the case in the after part. The President of the Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, expressed the opinion that what crews really required was not so much an increase in the sleeping accommodation as in the messing accommodation, inasmuch as they had to eat in their sleeping quarters, and that was not desirable. Petty Officers had mess rooms, but the crew had to do everything in the one room allotted to them. He suggested that 120 cubic feet of space proposed by Sir Gilbert Parker should stand, but that the shipbuilder should be at liberty to give the extra space if he chose in mess.rooms, bath.rooms, and washing.places, and should deduct their measurement from the total, so long as the minimum sleeping accommodation did not go below the present standard of 72 cubic feet. 67 He invited the Committee to substitute a clause which he had drafted, for that moved by Sir Gilbert Parker, which provided that in future 120 cubic feet and 15 superficial feet should be the minimum accommodation for seamen and apprentices. In estimating the space so apportioned, there may be taken into account the space occupied by any mess.rooms, bath.rooms or washing.places appropriated exclusively to the use of seamen and apprentices, provided always that the space set apart for sleeping shall not be less than 72 cubic feet and 12 superficial feet. This new clause was then added to the Bill. In does not apply to any ship (a) registered before the passing of this Act ; (b) any ship of not more than 200 tons burthen ; (c) fishing boats ; (d) space occupied solely by lascars and appropriated solely to their use. The Section (64) will be found quoted on a subsequent page. It will thus be noted that largely as a result of the action of the Port Sanitary Committee, Section 64 was added to the new Bill, and subsequently became law. Although the superficial area is much below what should be allowed, and what could be allowed to seamen, yet there is no doubt it will effect considerable improvement in the conditions on board ship, and may be taken as an instalment on account of additional accommodation and comfort to be provided by future legislation. I append some extracts from the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, which should have the effect of improving the hygienic conditions on board ship. Section 13.—A "passenger steamer" shall include every foreign steamship, whether originally proceeding from a port in the United Kingdom or from a port out of the United Kingdom, which carries passengers to or from any place, or between any places, in the United Kingdom. Section 14.—Defines a " steerage passenger,'' which shall mean all passengers except cabin passengers, and persons shall not be deemed cabin passengers unless— " (a) the space allotted to their exclusive use is in the proportion " of at least thirty.six clear superficial feet to each statute adult ; " and " (b) the fare contracted to be paid by them amounts to at least " the sum of twenty.five pounds for the entire voyage, or is in the 68 " proportion of at least sixty.five shillings for every thousand miles " of the length of the voyage ; and " (c) they have been furnished with a duly signed contract " ticket in the form prescribed by the Board of Trade for cabin " passengers." Section 16.—A ship shall not carry passengers, whether cabin or steerage passengers, on more than one deck below the water line. Section 17.—Gives the Board of Trade power to prescribe regulations, scales, conditions, and forms in substitution for those contained in the Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Schedules of the 1894 Act, which relate to (a) the number of persons carried on emigrant ships ; (b) the accommodation for steerage passengers on emigrant ships (c) the provisions and water to be issued to steerage passengers on emigrant ships ; (d) the carriage of horses and cattle on emigrant ships, and (e) the forms to be used under Part III. of that Act. Section 18.—The master of every emigrant ship shall, on request produce to any steerage passenger a copy of the scale of provisions to which that person is entitled, and shall post up copies of the scale in at least two conspicuous places between the decks on which steerage passengers may be carried. The master shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding forty shillings for every day during any part of which by his act or default copies of the extracts are not posted up, and shall, if he fails to produce a copy of the scale as required by this section to a steerage passenger, for each offence be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. Section 25.—The master of every ship for which an agreement with the crew is required under the Merchant Shipping Acts shall, if the agreement is made after the first day of June, nineteen hundred and seven, furnish provisions to every member of the crew (who does not furnish his own provisions) in accordance with the scale set out in the First Schedule of this Act. If the master of a ship fails to furnish provisions in accordance with this section, and the court before which the case is tried consider that the failure was due to the neglect or default of the master, the master shall be liable on summary conviction, in addition to paying compensation, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, This section shall not apply to lascars or natives of India, or others not accustomed to a European dietary. 69 FIRST SCHEDULE.

The issue of provisions for which a total weekly, and no daily, amount is given in the above scale, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the week. 2. The issue of soft bread under the scale shall not be required:— (a) in a ship of less than one thousand tons gross registered tonnage; or (b) if rough weather renders the making of the bread impracticable; or (c) in any ship until the date of the first agreement with the crew entered into after the first day of January, nineteen hundred and eight ; but where soft bread is not issued, an equivalent amount of biscuit shall be issued instead. 3. An equal quantity of fish, up to an amount not exceeding threequarters of a pound, in any one week, may be substituted for preserved meat under the above scale. The fish issued, whether under the scale or as a substitute, must be fresh fish, dried fish, or canned salmon or canned herrings. 4. Within the tropics, a pound and a half of preserved meat, or three pounds of fresh meat, may be substituted for two pounds of salt pork. 5. Fresh potatoes must be issued for at least the first eight weeks of the voyage in the case of every ship leaving a port within the home-trade limits at any time between the last day of September and the first day of May, and at any other time when they can be procured at a reasonable cost. When fresh potatoes are not so issued, an equal amount of yams, or vegetables preserved in tins, or an equivalent amount of dried or compressed potatoes or dried or compressed vegetables in the proportion of one pound to six pounds of fresh potatoes, must be issued in their place. 6. Fresh vegetables, or vegetables preserved in tins, may at any time be substituted for dried or compressed vegetables in the proportion of half-apound of fresh vegetables, or vegetables preserved in tins, to one ounce of dried or compressed vegetables. 7. A mixture of coffee and chicory, containing not less than seventy-five per cent. of coffee, may at any time be substituted for coffee in the proportion of five ounces of the mixture to four ounces of coffee. 8. The dried fruit issued under the above scale must be raisins, sultanas, currants, figs or prunes. 71 9. The onions to be issued under the above scale must be fresh onions when in season; and, when fresh onions are not in season, an equal amount of onions, or vegetables preserved in tins, or an equivalent amount of dried or compressed onions or vegetables in the proportion of one ounce to half-apound of fresh onions, must be issued. 10. In port:— (a) soft bread shall be issued in lieu of biscuit ; and (b) when procurable at a reasonable cost, a pound and a half of fresh meat and half-a-pound of fresh vegetables shall be issued daily, and, when fresh meat and fresh vegetables are so issued, salt and preserved meat and dried or compressed vegetables need not be issued. 11, The stokehold hands are to receive sufficient oatmeal and one quart of water extra daily while under steam. SUBSTITUTES AND EQUIVALENTS—NOT TO BE USED WITHOUT REASONABLE CAUSE. Fresh meat 1½ lbs. To be considered equal. Salt meat 1 lb. Preserved meat ¾ ” Coffee ½ oz. To be considered equal. Cocoa ½ ” Tea ¼ ” Flour 1 lb. To be considered equal. Biscuit 1 ” Rice 1 „ Split peas 1/3 Pt. To be considered equal when issued with meat rations. Flour ¾ lb. Calavances or haricot beans 1 pt. Rice ¾ lb. Marmalade 1 lb. To be considered equal Jam 1 " Butter ½ „ Mustard - To be considered equal. Curry powder - Section 26—Gives power to an inspecting officer appointed under the Act of 1894 to inspect any provisions or water intended for the use of the crew of any British ship, and if he finds that the provisions or water are in any respect deficient in quality, the ship shall be detained until the defects are remedied to his satisfaction. Section 27—After the 30th June, 1908, every British foreign-going ship of 1,000 tons and upwards, going to sea from any place in the 72 British Isles, or on the continent of Europe between the River Elbe and Brest, shall be provided with a certificated cook who is able to prove one month's service at sea in some capacity. Section 34.—(2) If the master or a seaman is, on account of any illness, temporarily removed from his ship for the purpose of preventing infection, or otherwise for the convenience of the ship, and subsequently returns to his duty, the expense of the removal and of providing the necessary advice and attendance and medicine, and of his maintenance while away from the ship, shall be defrayed by the owner of the ship, without any deduction on that account from his wages. This, at first sight, would seem to enable the Port Sanitary Authority to claim from the owner the expenses in connection with seamen landed from vessels on account of infectious disease, but the section contains " only in the event of his subsequently returning to his duty." The master usually takes the first opportunity of "paying off'" at the nearest shipping office any man so landed; thus he is unable subsequently to return to duty, and, in my opinion, the expenses cannot be recovered under this Act. Section 64—Amends Section 210, so that Section 210 will now read as follows :—(1)—Sub-section (1) of Section 210 of the principal Act (which provides for the space required for each seaman or apprentice in any place in a British ship occupied by seamen or apprentices and appropriated to their use) shall be construed as if a space of not less than one hundred and twenty cubic feet, and of not less than fifteen superficial feet measured on the deck or floor of that place, were substituted for a space of not less than seventy-two cubic feet, and of not less than twelve superficial feet measured on the deck or floor of that place. (2) In estimating the space available for the proper accommodation of seamen and apprentices, there may be taken into account the space occupied by any mess-rooms, bath-rooms, or washing places appropriated exclusively to the use of those seamen and apprentices, so, however, that the space in any place appropriated to the use of seamen or apprentices in which they sleep is not less than seventy-two cubic feet and twelve superficial feet for each seaman or apprentice. (3) Nothing in this section shall affect — (a) any ship registered before the passing of this Act, or which was in course of construction on the first day of January, nineteen hundred and seven; or (b) any ship of not more than three hundred tons burden; or (c) any fishing boat within the meaning of Part IV. of the principal Act, or require any additional space to be given in the cases of places occupied solely by Lascars and appropriated to their use. This Act shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, come into operation on the 1st June, 1907; but some of the clauses become operative from the date of the passing of the Act, viz.:— 73 TABLE XXV.

Following the system adopted last year, the nuisances found on vessels have been kept distinct from those discovered elsewhere, and are dealt with in Tables XXV. and XXVI. respectively. The total number of nuisances discovered on vessels was 4,042 against 4,095 in the previous year, but the total number of vessels structurally defective was, in 1906, 396, as against 333 in the previous twelve months. The largest number of complaints will be seen to be with regard to the dirty condition of the quarters occupied by seamen and firemen, while other nuisances were in regard to ventilation, lighting and heating, leaky decks, &c. Smoke nuisances to the number of 231 were received and dealt with. This number is less than in 1905, when it was 257. With regard to the premises other than vessels, the total number dealt with during the year was 340 as against 237 in 1905. The largest proportion is, as in the case of vessels, complaints with regard to the generally dirty condition of sundry premises. Twenty-eight related to smoke, of which number 11 were recurrences, 16 related to the condition of sanitary conveniences, and 15 to accumulations of offensive matter. In dealing with these nuisances, written intimations to the number of 562 were sent, while 159 Statutory Notices were served. A steamship of 7,530 tons register, built at Belfast in 1905, has recently been inspected in this port. It was found that no accommodation was provided for the storage of provisions, which are issued for the use of the native crew. As a result, in the quarters occupied by the native crew, a carcass of a sheep was found lying across a barrel partly filled with flour, potatoes and other vegetables, bread, &c., were found in the bunks, and bags of rice, &c., were lying about the quarters. The tanks containing the drinking water for the native crew were fitted in the closets on each side, with taps through the bulkhead. In order to fill the tanks a person had to enter the closet and fill them by removing covers twelve inches in diameter. The covers were off at the time of inspection, and the water was in consequence exposed to the tainted air. The defects were brought to the notice of the Marine Superintendent, who has given instructions to have them remedied at once. It is strange that this arrangement of storing the drinking water could have been considered satisfactory by the Authority concerned with the registration of the vessel. 76 Legal proceedings were recommended in nine cases, but were found necessary only in two.

In the following Table a list is given of the barges which have been found during the year carrying, or engaged in the carrying of cargoes of offensive matter, and on which there has been a nuisance due to the defective structure of the vessel. A good deal has been done by the Port Sanitary Authority in the direction of bringing the owners of barges to some recognition of their duty in this respect, but it still occasionally happens that the condition of things found in the cabins of barges carrying cargoes of the nature referred to is indescribably filthy. The following are two recent cases which are typical of a large number:— The barge "Scarboro'," which was inspected on the 2nd October last, had been carrying a cargo of dung. This cargo was only separated from the living quarters by a bulkhead of single planks, this bulkhead extending only to the lining of the vessel, leaving, therefore, a clear space between the lining and the skin at the sides and bottom, through which foul emanations and liquid would gain access to the living quarters in the cabin. The cabin floor was fixed, that is, nailed down, and could not be lifted so that any filthy accumulation underneath might be removed, and the bed lodgings were found to be the home of a quantity of maggots. 78 The barge ''Sunbeam," mentioned in the Table following, is a case of a recurring nuisance, a Statutory Notice having been previously served upon the owners of the vessel. The barge was seen on the 1st October last, carrying a cargo of dustbin refuse. As in the previous case, the bulkhead separating the offensive cargo from the cabin was ineffective. The cabin floor was in disrepair, and, on lifting it, the bilges were found to be exceedingly foul, containing an accumulation of offensive black liquid matter, while the woodwork was befouled with slime and maggots. From this it will be seen that the repulsive conditions found in the cabins of these barges constitute a serious nuisance. While this Report was in preparation, a Deputation of the Trade Union Congress Parliamentary Committee waited upon the President of the Board of Trade, and amongst other things considered was the question of insanitary barges. The President of the Board of Trade was asked to take action with a view to ensuring the sanitary inspection of all barges navigating the Thames, in the interests of health, and that pressure should be brought to bear on the Watermen's Company when registering barges, to see that these vessels were in a proper sanitary condition. The President of the Board of Trade is reported to have said that something was being done by the Board's Surveyors, but that their powers in this matter were very slight. He hoped, however, when the Government took in hand the question of the administration of the Port of London that he would be able to deal more effectively with the grievances mentioned. It is interesting to notice that lightermen themselves are moving in the matter, as some indication that the conditions repeatedly exposed by your Medical Officer in his Reports, and the action taken by the Port Sanitary Authority in the matter, have been fully justified. 79 TABLE XXVIII.

The number of infringements against the Bye laws relating to Offensive Cargoes reported during the year was 20. One case was of somewhat unusual interest, the facts being as follows:— On the 23rd June, the s.s. "Pomeranian," of Glasgow, 85,193, arrived in the Surrey Commercial Dock, having landed cattle at Havre, the cattle dung and fittings remaining on board. The dung was removed into a barge named the "William Howard," of Rochester, 44,594, but the Customs, acting under an order of the Board of Agriculture, refused to allow it to be landed in this country, or for the barge to be removed from the Dock. 81 As there seemed no prospect of the matter being dealt with, I drew the attention of the Board of Agriculture to the Bye-laws of this Authority relating to Offensive Cargoes, which provide that:— "Where, for the purpose of removal within, or carriage through the "District of the Port Sanitary Authority, any cargo, load or collection "of fœcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid has been put into or "upon any ship, boat or vessel, the owner or consignee, or any person "who has undertaken to deliver such cargo, load or collection, or who is "in charge of the same, or of such ship, boat or vessel, shall not without "a reasonable excuse, permit or allow or cause such ship, boat or vessel "containing such cargo, load or collection, or any undischarged portion "thereof, to remain within the said district for a longer period than "forty-eight hours." As a result, the barge was allowed to leave the Dock on condition that the dung was either exported or thrown overboard at sea, the latter alternative being adopted and carried out under the supervision of an officer of H.M. Customs. It has not been necessary to take any legal proceedings under these Bye-laws. TABLE XXIX. HOSPITAL. Number of Cases Admitted, Cost of Maintenance, &c.

The total number of cases treated in the Hospital during the year was 91, an excess of 31 over the number for 1905. The increase was due principally to the admission to Denton Hospital of a number of boys from the training ship "Arethusa," suffering from Scarlet Fever, which I have dealt with in my remarks on that disease. The average number of days treatment for each case was 23.19, while the average daily cost of maintenance per head was 1s. 4.34d. Of the cases admitted, two only had a fatal termination, one a case of Enteric Fever* and the other from Acute Tuberculosis. There were eight remaining undischarged at the end of the year. In the beginning of the year it was decided to abolish the existing system of lighting the Hospital by means of oil lamps. This was, of course, practically the only available method of lighting the Hospital in the absence of a public gas supply. The Gravesend and Milton Gas Company were approached, and they agreed to lay a main pipe to the Hospital in consideration of a payment of 100. towards the expense of doing this. The installation was completed during March, and the ground and hospital generally are much better illuminated. Water Supply.—The pump and machinery have been thoroughly overhauled during the year, and an ample supply of drinking water of an excellent quality has been obtained. The disinfecting apparatus is still continuing in efficient use after 14 years' service. The boiler is inspected periodically by the Engineer of an Insurance Company, who reports it as being in good condition. Drainage.—The excrement from patients is cremated, and only slopwater and laundry waste is allowed to pass into the drains. These discharge into a collecting tank, whence it passes through a contact bed, and a satisfactory effluent thence discharges into the River. * This patient was a sailor who came to this country as a member of the crew of a Japanese Man-o'-War. At the request of the Japanese Consul the remains were cremated in the Corporation Crematorium at Ilford and the ashes delivered to the Consul for conveyance to Japan. 88 STAFF. In order to efficiently perform the work of medical inspection under the Aliens Act, 1905, it was necessary to appoint an additional Medical Officer, and Dr. A. H. Hogarth was accordingly temporarily appointed as an Assistant Medical Officer for duty at Gravesend. At Sheerness, the work of medical inspection still continues to be carried out in a satisfactory manner by Dr. E. V. Legge. Office Staff and Inspectors,—There are no changes to report in connection with this section of the Staff. Steam Launches and Hulks.—The only change amongst these crews is that one of the deck boys resigned his position in order to farther develop his qualifications as a waterman, and another boy has been engaged in his place. Denton Hospital.—There were, at the end of the year, two vacancies in the Staff of the Hospital. The Assistant Nurse, Miss Isabel Deehan, who had held the appointment since July, 1904, having left to take a more important appointment elsewhere, and one of the N urse Probationers, Miss I. Walker, appointed in 1905, also resigned. The maidservant, E. Batchelor, resigned in September, and was replaced by Esther Robinson. CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with the requirements of Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I herewith report as to the execution of the Canal Boats Acts, 1877 and 1884, and the Regulations made thereunder, within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority during the year ending 31st December, 1906. (1) The general arrangements for the inspection of canal boats continue the same as in previous years. Each Sanitary Inspector has been appointed an Inspector of Canal Boats, and is required to inspect and report on a prescribed form the results of his examination of all canal boats found within his district. The following is a list of the names of the Sanitary Inspectors, together with the present remuneration of each Inspector. For official purposes, the address of each Sanitary Inspector is:—51, King William Street, Greenwich, London, S.E. 84 Inspector Garland 201/. 10s. per annum. Western District. London Dock. St. Katharine's Dock. Regent's Dock. Surrey Commercial Dock. Inspector Wetjen 175/. 10s. per annum. Eastern District. East India Dock. Royal Albert Dock. Royal Victoria Dock. Inspector Burr 175/. 10s. per annum. Central District. West India Dock. South West India Dock. Poplar Dock. Millwall Dock. Inspector Lambe 149/. 10s. per annum. Gravesend District. Tilbury Dock.

Inspector Romeril 201/. 10s. per annum. Lower District. Erith to seaward limits of Port of London (including part of River Med way). Inspector Rolfe 149/. 10s. per annum. 85 (2) The total number of boats inspected during the year was 1,502. This number is a substantial increase on the number inspected in any previous year in the Port of London since the Acts came into force, and may possibly be accounted for by a larger number of canal boats bringing goods into the Port of London, in consequence of improved trade conditions especially connected with an increase in exports and imports. Of the total number, 1,377 were found to conform to the Acts and Regulations. The total number ot infringements found was 164. A written notice was sent to the owner in each case, to which is attached a form which is to be returned when the infringement no longer exists, with a statement to that effect signed by an Inspector of Canal Boats. The total number of cautions given was 113. The difference in these numbers is accounted for by the fact that one notice, in many instances, covers several infringements. One hundred and seven of these Notices have been returned showing that the requirements of the Acts and Regulations have been complied with, leaving six only outstanding at the end of the year 1906. The various infringements are set out in the appended Table, and it will be noted that the largest number is in respect of structural defects and want of cleanliness respectively. These numbers compare favourably with those of previous years, and therefore indicate that inspection with regard to these particulars had been carefully carried out. The infringements next in order of importance in regard to numbers refer to the absence of certificates of registration and improper or inadequate lettering, marking and numbering of the boats. The frequency of this form of infringement is merely evidence of the carelessness of owners in regard to the provisions of the Acts, more especially when boats change owners. The number of boats found to be unregistered within the meaning of the Acts was ten. This number is less than that in any previous year. In these cases steps are always taken either to place the matter in the hands of the Registration Authority to which the boat belongs, or to register the boat with this Authority. Five boats have been registered by this Authority during the year, two of which were new registrations. 86 Eight instances of overcrowding were met with—in five cases persons of both sexes exceeding the maximum ages fixed by the Acts were found in occupation of cabins not registered for their occupation. These cases have all been dealt with without recourse to police court pro ceedings, and with satisfactory results, but in order to enforce compliance with the Acts, several cases were referred by your Worshipful Committee to the City Solicitor for any action he might deem desirable. In each instance a letter from him succeeded in bringing to the notice of the owner the necessity of at once taking steps to remove the cause for complaint. The "Trent," registered at Wolverhampton, No. 894, was inspected on the 26th February, 1906. The after cabin is registered for three adults or two adults and two children, and the fore cabin is registered for one adult or two children under twelve years of age. The boat was occupied by the master, his wife, her sister and three children, being one child in excess of the number for which the boat is registered. The Canal Boats Regulations III. (8b) provide that— "A cabin occupied as a sleeping place by a husband and his wife shall "not at any time while in such occupation be occupied as a sleeping "place by any other person of the female sex above the age of twelve "years, or by any other person of the male sex above the age of four" teen years." In the case of the above boat, the sister of the master's wife, age 17 years, was stated to occupy the fore cabin. This cabin was very damp and contained no evidence of occupation, and from appearances all the persons on board occupied the after cabin. The " Sandon," registered at Wolverhampton, No. 872, was inspected on the 23rd March, 1906. The after cabin is registered for three adults, or a man, his wife and three children, and the fore cabin is registered for two adults or three children. The boat was occupied by the master, his wife, and five children, and it was stated that they all occupied the after cabin. There was no evidence of occupation in the fore cabin. Both the boats belonged to the same owners, There being no legal power of entry between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., there was, of course, no opportunity of obtaining the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction. 87 On the 8th August, 1906, the canal boat "Joseph," registered at Berkhampstead, No, 363, was inspected, when it was found that the after cabin was occupied by one person in excess of the number for which it is registered; and further, that this cabin, while occupied as a sleeping place by the master and his wife, was also occupied as a sleeping place by another person of the female sex above the age of twelve years, namely, a daughter fifteen years of age. The infringements of the Acts and Regulations were brought to the notice of the owner of the boat on the 9th August, when he was called upon to remedy the same. The boat was again inspected on the 30th August, when it was found that the infringements still continued; and further, that the fore cabin was not in a habitable condition, inasmuch as the top was leaky and the cabin was in a dirty condition. This was one of the cases referred to Mr. Solicitor, and the owner took steps to have the girl removed and the necessary repairs done. No case of infectious disease has been met with during the year on any canal boat in the Port. Only one boat was met with which had no proper provision for carrying a supply of water for drinking. It will be seen that this compares very favourably with the experience of previous years, and it undoubtedly indicates that much more attention is paid to this important part of a canal boat's equipment than was formerly the practice. For many years past your officers have invariably insisted upon adequate provision of this kind being made upon every boat registered or met with in the Port, and it will appear that this course is now producing a definite and satisfactory result. A case of some interest with regard to the registration of a boat occurred during the year. On the 18th June, 1906, the canal boat "Providence," registered at Rotherhithe, No. 22, was met with, but no certificate of registration could be produced, The owner was communicated with, and he having no certificate, applied to the Rotherhithe Registration Authority for a copy of his certificate. He found that Rotherhithe as a Registration Authority under the Canal Boats Acts no longer existed. 88 Formerly the District Council of Rotherhithe was a Registration Authority under the Canal Boats Acts, but with the formation of the Metropolitan Boroughs under the London Government Act, 1899, the Council of Rotherhithe ceased to exist and the district became merged partly into the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford and partly into the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey, Neither of these Boroughs, however, have been constituted a Registration Authority under the Acts, and the owner was therefore called upon to register the boat with the Port of London Registration Authority, and in the end, the boat was re-registered accordingly, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HERBERT WILLIAMS, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London.
