THE VESTRY OF THE parish of Saint Scorge, HANOVER SQUARE. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 25th MARCH, 1884. JUNE 1884. LONDON : PRINTED BY PHIPPS & CONNOR, 13 & 14, TOTH1LL STREET, WESTMINSTER. 1884. HAN33 REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE Parish of St. George, Nanober Square, for the year 1883. BY W.H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (Lond.), Professor of Hygiene and Public Health in University College, London, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST. (BEING HIS TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT.) To the Vestrn of Parish of St. George, HANOVER SQUARE. My Lords and Gentlemen, The death-rate of this Parish for the year 1883 was lower than that of any previous year. This continual lowering of the death-rate for the past few years shows, we may most reasonably hope and believe, continued and progressive sanitary improvement. It is, however, hardly likely that so very low a rate will be maintained. 2 Table I. YEAR. Gross Total of Deaths. Deaths in Public Institutions. Proportional Share of Deaths in Publio Institutions.

Of this gross total of 1,845 deaths, as many as 829, the highest number yet recorded, occurred in Public Institutions in the Parish, while our share of the deaths occurring in all 3 the Public Institutions of London was only 390. Thus our corrected total of deaths was only 1,406, or 208 less than the annual average for the preceding 10 years. This is equivalent to a death-rate of 15.70 per thousand per annum, the average during the preceding 10 years having been 17.71. Table Ia.

The death-rate of London proper with an estimated population of 3,955,814, was 20.4, the lowest death-rate on record in London ; that of the twenty-eight large English towns (including London) was 21.6. The death-rate of Greater London, estimated population 4,990,952, was 19.7 per thousand per annum (against 20.6 in 1882), being, as just stated, 20.4 in London proper, and 16.7 in the Outer Ring; or, when corrected for the deaths in the three Middlesex County Lunatic Asylums, only 16.2 in the Outer Ring. Not one of the twenty-eight large English towns had nearly so low a death-rate as this Parish ; the nearest to it are the following:— Bristol 17.9 Derby 18.1 Bradford 18.4 Portsmouth 18.6 Brighton 19.2 Leicester 19.4 4 Norwich 19.7 Birkenhead 19.8 Halifax 20.1 Cardiff 20.2 London 20.4 and these vary from 2 to nearly 5 per thousand above it. Of fifty large town districts in England only one had a lower death-rate than this Parish in 1883, namely, Barrowin-Furness with 15.4. The average rate for these fifty towns was the same as in 1882, viz., 20.4 per thousand per annum, and the highest was Ashton-under-Lyne with 261. The death-rate of Dublin has risen from 27.9 in 1882 to 29.2 for this year. Glasgow had also a higher death-rate, having had 25.4 in 1882 and 28.2 in 1883. Next to these come Manchester with 27.6, and Liverpool with 26.7. Our death-rate was, as usual, considerably below that of any foreign city; the lowest among these being Christiania 17.3, Philadelphia 22.2, Geneva 22.8, Baltimore 23.0, and the highest Madras 39.4, Prague 35.3, St. Petersburgh 32.6.

The birth-rate was also in consequence lower, being 20 97 per thousand per annum. The birth-rate in London proper was 33.9, being lower than any recorded in the previous 22 years; while the marriage and the death rates were lower than any previously recorded. In Greater London the birth-rate was 34.0, and in the Outer Ring 34.5. The average birth-rate of the 28 largest English towns was 34.7, the highest being those of Sunderland, 41.9 ; Nottingham, 39-5 ; Cardiff, 39.2; and the lowest those of Halifax, 29.0 ; Brighton and Bradford, 29.2. The deaths of children under one year of age were 287, being only a very few more than in the two previous exceedingly low years. The percentage of these deaths to the registered births was 15-28, and the percentage to total deaths was 15.56, both higher numbers than those of the previous two years, but easily accounted for by the extremely low birth-rate. The mortality of children under one year was 152 to 1,000 births; the average for the 28 large English towns was 156, and for London the number was 146. Twelve of the 28 large towns had a lower number, which is probably accounted for by the higher birth-rates. The number was highest in the following towns:— Preston 210, Leicester 189, Liverpool 185, and Manchester, 177. Table III. YEAR. A. Persons aged sixty years and upwards. b. Violence. O.

As expected, this percentage is much higher than that for London generally, but when compared with the population living, it is low. Thus in this Parish the 537 deaths are equivalent to 59.9 per 1,000 persons living, while in London generally there are 71.3 such deaths to every 1,000 persons living. In none of the 28 large English towns is the mor tality of persons of 60 years of age and upwards as low as in this Parish. The lowest are Nottingham 62.7, Derby 64.3, Leicester 65.1; the highest is Halifax with 102.9; and the average for the 28 towns is 75.3. The percentage of violent deaths is slightly higher than last year, and, as usual, is higher than that of London generally. The percentage of inquest cases is very slightly over the average of the previous 9 years, and is lower than that for London generally. The uncertified deaths were 27, or 1.46 per cent, of the total deaths, as against 1.22 per cent, for London generally. From Tables IV. and IVa. we see that the birth-rates and the death-rates are very low in all the Sub-Districts, and are, indeed, lower than any recorded for 8 years at least, except the birth-rate for Mayfair, which is 16.61, and was 16.54 in 1875. Mayfair has the lowest birth-rate and the lowest deathrate, while Belgravia has the highest birth-rate and the highest death-rate of the three Sub-Districts. The death-rate of Mayfair, which was very low last year, 11.87, is still slightly lower this year, being only 11.34. 7 Table IV. SU B-DISTRICT. Population at middle of 1883. Births. Birth-rate.

Hanover Square Sub-District - 63-77 years. Mayfair 72.62 „ Belgravia 51.83 „ Whole Parish 55.09 „ The mean duration of life in this Parish during the last 9 years has been as follows :— In 1875 it was 46.67 years. „ 1876 „ 47.96 „ „ 1877 „ 49.52 „ „ 1878 „ 48.03 „ „ 1879 „ 48.55 „ „ 1880 „ 58.01 „ „ 1881 „ 50.26 „ „ 1882 „ 52.56 „ „ 1883 „ 55.09 „ So that the mean duration of life in this Parish during those 9 years has averaged 50.74 years. The mean duration of life in London during the last 6 years has been, according to my calculations, as follows:— In 1878 it was 34.24 years. „ 1879 „ 34.23 „ 1880 „ 35.17 „ „ 1881 „ 35.87 „ „ 1882 „ 36.82 „ „ 1883 „ 37.88 „ So that the mean duration of life in this Parish has been increased by 9 years since 1875, and that in London by more than 31/2 years since 1879.

The 129 deaths are equivalent to 1.44 per 1,000 persons living at all ages, while the rate for London was 2-74, and that for the twenty-eight large towns 2.86 per 1,000 living. Of these towns only three were below this number namely, Norwich l.0l, Halifax 1.04, Bristol l.23, while that of Bradford, 147, was nearly the same; the highest was Liverpool with 4.49. The deaths from each of the infectious diseases and from diarrhaea were all considerably below the decennial average, with the exception of diphtheria, which is credited with 27 deaths, and simple continued fever with 8 deaths. Small Pox.—There were no deaths registered from this disease in the Parish during the year. Measles caused only 13 deaths, a smaller number than in any one of the preceding ten years except 1878, when it caused only 11 deaths. On account of a wide-spread outbreak of this disease in Belgravia, in March 1884, I considered it necessary to order the closing of three schools for three weeks. Scarlet Fever caused only 11 deaths, the only years in which it caused a smaller number being 1873 and 1878, in each of which it caused 9 deaths. One of the deaths registered as from Scarlet Fever was that of a non-parishioner at St. George's Hospital, from Kidney Disease after Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria caused, as already stated, no less than 27 deaths, a much higher number than in any one of the preceding ten years, the highest number before being 18 in 1880. Of the 27 deaths from this disease, 7 were those of 12 non-parishioners at St. George's Hospital, 1 was that of a case known to have been imported, and 1 was probably from Croup; on the other hand 1 death of a person from this Parish occurred in Marylebone. Diphtheria was very prevalent in London generally in 1883, and caused no less than 503 deaths more than in 1882. Whooping Cough caused only 21 deaths, a smaller number than in any of the ten preceding years, except 1877, when it caused 19, and 1881, when it caused only 15 deaths. Typhus Fever.—No death from this disease was registered in the Parish during the year. Enteric (or Typhoid) Fever.—The number of deaths from this disease registered in the Parish, 21, was the same as in 1882; of these, however, 8 were deaths of nonparishioners in St. George's Hospital, 3 were those of oases known to have been imported, and 1 was that of an infant, registered as " Gastric Fever." Simple Continued Fever.—Of the 8 deaths registered as from this disease, 4 were merely cases of disease accompanied by Fever, 1 being a case of Cancer. Diarrhoea.—Only 27 deaths were registered from this disease, a smaller number than in any of the preceding ten years. One death from English Cholera was also registered. A death of an infant from " Gangrenous Chicken Pox " was registered, and also 1 from " Infantile Remittent Fever." Small Pox in London. The number of deaths from Small Pox, in London, which had been 2,371 in 1881, and 431 in 1882, still further declined to 134 in 1883. 13 Sanitary Work. For the Year ending March 31st, 1884. The following Table has been compiled for me by Mr. Joseph Snook, your Sanitary Inspector, from the Report Book:— Table VI. Various kinds of Complaints of Nuisances, §c., from April lst, 1883, to March 31st, 1884. Total number of Complaints 678 Notices served 122 Houses and premises limewhited 35 Houses disinfected after infectious diseases . 87 Old brick drains abolished, and glazed stoneware pipes substituted 4 ew drains constructed .... 6 Drains unstopped and repaired ... 81 Drains trapped and ventilated, sinks disconnected, &c 42 Closets supplied with water ... 24 Closets unstopped and repaired ... 32 Roofs repaired ...... 2 New dust bins provided .... 5 Dust bins renewed, repaired, new covers, &c. 19 Cisterns repaired, new covers, &c. . . 27 New cisterns provided . . . .11 Waste pipes disconnected .... 74 Removal of animals improperly kept (cases of) 1 Meat, fish, &c., condemned (cases of) . 1 Overcrowding abated 2 Cesspools abolished 10 Accumulation of dung, straw, &c., removed 21 Various nuisances removed 31 No cause for complaint or inspection 22 Legal proceedings taken 2 Cases could not assist 6 Cases referred to Surveyor 19 14 Cases referred to Police 1 Licensed cow-houses 1 Licensed slaughter-houses 9 Cases removed to Hospitals 43 Inspection of houses after cases of infectious diseases, viz.— Typhoid and low fever . . .13 Typhus fever .... 0 Scarlet fever 82 Small-pox 5 Diphtheria.22 The articles disinfected in the hot-air disinfecting chamber belonging to the Parish were as follows:— 70 Beds 40 Waistcoats 120 Mattresses 35 Trousers 40 Palliasses 62 Carpets 92 Quilts 30 Hearth-rugs 220 Blankets 33 Curtains 122 Sheets 75 Towels 92 Bolsters 30 Cushions 195 Pillows 40 Table Covers 29 Dresses 30 Rugs 23 Shawls 14 Suits of Clothing 35 Coats And a large quantity of sundry articles. The total number of complaints attended to and of notices served was larger than in 1882—678 as compared with 603. The old hot-air disinfecting oven had become worn out, so your Committee of Works sanctioned the purchase of a new one, and I recommended the fitting up of one of Dr. Ransom's, and the construction of a new disinfecting chamber with an entirely separate room for the articles after disinfection ; this work has been carried out very thoroughly, and the system works well. The two cases in which it was necessary to take legal proceedings on account of neglect to comply with the notices for Sanitary Improvements were as follows :— 15 In one the water had been cut off on account ot nonpayment of water-rate, and a nuisance was produced by the state of the water-closet; the magistrate granted five days for the defendant to pay the rate and get the water put on, and mulcted him in the costs; this had the desired effect. In the other a variety of sanitary defects had to be remedied, and the magistrate made an order and fined the defendant 25s. and costs; the work was executed within the fourteen days allowed. The markets have been regularly inspected and kept in good order, so that it has only been necessary to condemn food exposed for sale in one case. The slaughter-houses and cow-houses have been also regularly inspected, and kept in good condition. No application for a license has been opposed; but licenses were not applied for in the cases of one slaughter-house and one cow-house. Your Committee of "Works decided to memorialise the Government as to the desirability of replacing the duty of inspecting the bake-houses in the metropolis in the hands of the Sanitary Authorities; this has since been done by " The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883," and the bakehouses are now regularly inspected and kept in a cleanly condition. On account of a communication from the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with regard to Lancashire Court, New Bond Street, which I had formerly reported as an area suitable to be dealt with under the " Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, 1875," I made a special inspection of that Court, and prepared a report, showing that nearly the whole of the houses there had been since converted into workshops, and that no overcrowding existed in any part of the court; this report was adopted by your Committee of Works, and forwarded to the Secretary of State. In view of the existence of Cholera in Egypt, I thought it desirable to commence preparations for a possible outbreak of it in London in 1884, and accordingly searched 16 the Parish for a site for a Cholera Hospital. Three possible localities were found, but I only considered one of them well suited for the purpose, and I therefore applied to the Duke of Westminster, the owner of the land, for permission to use it for the purpose in question, should it be needed. His Grace gave permission at once, and gave the present occupiers notice to quit; fortunately, we have not, as yet, found it neccessary to avail ourselves of the privilege so freely granted.

In both cases the average quality was superior to that of the preceding year, and this was especially the case with the Chelsea Company's water. The common gas supplied by the London Gas Company has been examined by me from time to time at their testing room, and has always been found to be above the required standard of illuminating power, and to satisfy the prescribed tests for ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen. For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases is kept at the Workhouse, in Mount Street; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply to the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington; or, in case of small-pox, at the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, where they can be accommodated on favourable terms. I have the houour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. H. CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (London). 10, Bolton Row, Mayfair, W., June 1884. APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health. Summary of Analytical Work for the Year ending March 25th, 1884. NAME OF SAMPLE. Genuine. Or doubtful Quality. Adulterated. Total. Milk 15 5 3 23 Bread 16 — — 16 Tea 15 — 1 16 Coffee 2 — 2 4 Mustard 4 — 12 16 Pepper 5 — 13 18 Flour 16 — — 16 Sugar 18 3 — 16 Arrowroot. 6 — — 6 Vinegar 0 — — 9 Cocoa — — 4 4 Lemon Juice 1 — — Butter 1 — — 1 103 8 35 146 19 Of these 146 samples, only two, viz., a sample of lemon juice and a sample of butter, were brought by private purchasers; each sample was found on analysis to be genuine, and I gave certificates to that effect. Of the fifteen genuine samples of Milk, two were purchased with the view of prosecutions at shops where adulterated samples had previously been obtained. Of the three samples of Milk certified as adulterated, two were purchased for information, the other was purchased at a shop where an adulterated sample had previously been bought. A conviction was obtained by your Inspector, on my certificate of adulteration, in this case as follows:— James Ely, of 5, Westmoreland Street, for selling milk containing 14 per cent of added water. Fined 10s. and 2s. costs. The samples of Milk classed as " of doubtful quality " were poor or partly skimmed. The sample of Tea classed as " adulterated " contained exhausted leaves; of the fifteen other samples twelve contained small quantities of " Lie " tea. The adulterated samples of Coffee contained more or less chicory. The adulterated samples of Mustard contained more or less wheat starch, and with one exception, were coloured with turmeric. The adulterated samples of Pepper contained rice flour, and one sample also contained turmeric. The three samples of Sugar classed as " of doubtful quality" were dirty samples containing fragments of cane, dust, &c. 20 Of the four samples of Cocoa examined, two contained arrowroot, and two contained " much arrowroot" and sago. The number of samples found to be adulterated is the same as that for the previous year. W. H. CORFIELD, Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry, Public Analyst.
