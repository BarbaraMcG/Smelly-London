AC439(1) ACT 54 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1951 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1951 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1951 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit the Annual Report of the health of the Borough of Acton for the year 1951. During this year the fifteenth Census was taken and it is interesting to compare some of the population figures, published in the preliminary report, with those of the previous census of 1931. The population of the Borough of Acton in 1931 was 70,008 persons, and in 1951 it was 67,424 persons, a decrease of 3.7% or 2,534 persons. Set out below are some population statistics of particular interest with the percentage increase or decrease of the population in 1931. England & Wales 43,744,924 persons + 9.49% County of London 3,348,336 ,, - 23.8% Greater London (roughly the Met. Police Area) 8,346,137 ,, + 1.6% County of Middlesex 2,268,776 ,, + 38.4% The populations of some of the outlying districts of Middlesex have increased amazingly, e.g. Harrow—127.1%; Ruislip-Northwood 325.8%. 4 As a rule the Census is taken at the end of the first quarter. If it was taken later, summer holiday resorts would show excessive populations. This year the Census was taken on the 8th April and it is upon this figure that the Registrar General estimates the mid- year population. One should note that this year's estimate is 67,540 persons. Of this number 5,272 are children of 0-4 years, and 7,327 are children of 5-14 years. The report reveals that, since the beginning of the century, the percentage of all men over 65 has increased from 6.6 to 9.3, and the percentage of women in that age group has risen from 8.3 to 12.3, whereas the percentage of adult males (15-34 years) has declined from 33.8 to 27,9, the percentage of women in the same: age group has fallen from 33.0 to 26.9 due to the fall in the birthrate. The most difficult aspect of an ageing population—and this has been known for some time—is the welfare of old people. Old per sons who are able to walk and be active are well catered for, but there is another group who have reached a further stage at which they are unable to care for themselves and have no relations to help them. These do not necessarily need hospital care, but do need someone at the back of them to keep them clean and tidy, and save them from losing interest in themselves. All old persons like to feel the rooms they occupy are their homes, however limited is their physical ability to maintain their surroundings in a tidy state. For this group of old people an almshouse type of building is needed, where each person has a bed-sitting-room with means of making hot drinks and storing food, but where there is also a common dining-room where one or two meals could be provided for them. There should also be a resident nurse who is responsible for the old persons' welfare, and who can supervise the cleanliness of persons and rooms. Such a type of establishment would, I believe, help many lonely old persons to live out the twilight of their lives contentedly. The figures for immunisation against diphtheria are set out in the body of the report, as also are the School Health Services returns for the Borough. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the staf of the Public Health Department my appreciation for their co operation and loyalty throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient Servant, George E. B.

The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. 13 Type No of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 214 Ear Swabs 6 Sputum for T.B. 6 Faeces 744 Hair, Widals, etc. 15 Methylene Blue Reductase Tests on Milk and Ice-Cream 323 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the teminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and these cannot be given in the home. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 No cases have been dealt with under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, but in those cases which have come to our notice it has been possible, by co-operating with the local hospital, to arrange for these persons to be admitted. The Borough of Acton carried out its obligations under Section 50 of this act. MASS X-RAY The North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Mass X-ray Unit visited Acton from the 30th July to 19th October, 1951. This period was interrupted by one or two short visits elsewhere. X-ray examinations were confined to: (i) people under 35 years of age. (ii) people over 35 years of age not previously X-rayed. The facilities of the Unit were not available to children under 14 years of age. Most of the period was given to group appointments from factories and other establishments, but on three days open sessions were held for the public to attend without an appointment. 14 I am indebted to the Physician in Charge of the Mass X-ray Unit for the following particulars of the persons who attended for examination. The statistics given do not necessarily relate only to persons residing in Acton, as the facilities were available to all, whether they resided in the Borough or not. Number of persons examined: Males 6,749 Females 3,595 10,344 Recalled for large films 351 Disposal of large film cases: (a) No further action 237 (b) To return to Unit for further X-ray 19 (c) Further investigation required (this does not necessarily indicate tuberculosis) 78 (d) Known cases had or having treatment 6 (e) Failed to return for large films 11 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council are responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 1,153 necessitating 21,979 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE The new Child Welfare Clinic at Trinity Way, East Acton, was opened on the 30th July, 1951, and took the place of the 15 Clinic previously held at John Perryn School, the rooms in which it was formerly held being needed for school purposes. The building at Trinity Way served as Sports Pavilion to the C.A.V. Athletic Club until recent years, and was converted to provide accommodation for a Child Welfare and Ante-Natal Clinic, and Dental and Minor Ailments Clinics. The new Clinic was not developed to its fullest extent during the year, but it was hoped to implement this early in 1952. The use of St. Gabriel's church hall, Noel Road, was continued throughout the year, as the new clinic in Cloister Road was not ready for occupation until January, 1952. Towards the end of the year a re-arrangement of the area provided for seven Health Visitors' districts, and from September onwards the bi-weekly sessions at Noel Road were shared by two Health Visitors. This arrangement was far from satisfactory as the accommodation provided was not suitable for dealing with large numbers, but it had been hoped that Cloister Road would have been available by that time. At the close of the year there were therefore five Clinics accommodating seven Health Visitor's districts. Each Health Visitor held two sessions weekly, generally one with a doctor in attendance and one without, but at Trinity Way the numbers warranted a doctor's attendance at both of the weekly sessions. At Steele Road a doctor attended on the second Monday of each month to carry out Diphtheria Immunisation in addition to the weekly doctor's session on Thursday afternoons. After the second Health Visitor's district had been transferred to St. Gabriel's Hall, Noel Road, two doctor's sessions were held there, but this still failed to remedy the overcrowding, and as soon as the transfer could be made to Cloister Road, an additional session without a doctor was given to each Health Visitor. Owing to the re-organisation of the district, a comparison of average weekly attendances with those of the previous year is not possible, but I am submitting the average attendances per session grouped under the five Clinics:- Avenue Road (4 sessions per week) 30.5 John Perryn and Trinity Way (2 sessions per week) 32.5 St. Gabriel's, Noel Road (2 sessions per week) 26.5 Palmerston Road (2 sessions per week) 30. Steele Road (2 sessions per week) 28. 16 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits made during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area: To expectant mothers—First visits 438 Total visits 671 To children under one year of age—First visits 958 Total visits 3,616 To children between the ages of one and five years—Total visits 4,878 INFANT WELFARE CLINICS Total number of children who first attended the Clinics during the vear, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: Under one year year of age 884 Between the ages of one and five 79 Total number of children in attendance at the end of the year: Under one year of age 709 Over one year 2,374 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under one year of age 12,345 By children between one and five years 5,791 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by; the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. During 1951, 303 women were recommended for admission to Central Middlesex County Hospital for their confinements and most of these were accepted. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS During the first nine months of the year, three sessions a week were held at Avenue Road and a fourth at Palmerston Road clinic, but in October one of the Avenue Road sessions was temporarily discontinued. 17 It was intended to start this session again during 1952 at one of the two new Clinics. Number of new Cases attending Clinics during year 697 Total number of attendances made 3,150 Average number attending weekly 61 The arrangements made by women for their confinements are tabulated below: % Confined in Central Middlesex County Hospital 46.2 Confined in Queen Charlotte's Hospital 23.1 Confined in other Hospitals 7.8 Confined in Nursing Homes 2.1 Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's Midwives attending) 20.4 Private Doctors and Midwives .4 EXERCISE CLASS FOR MOTHERS The classes for expectant mothers were continued throughout the year, the total number of women attending in 1951 being 61, as against 99 in 1950. The number of attendances also showed a decrease—785 as against 1,411 for 1950. This drop in figures may possibly be due to the fact that exercise classes are now held at the Ante-Natal clinic at Central Middlesex Hospital, and the mothers who have booked for their admission will probably attend the class there. PREMATURITY Emergency apparatus for this purpose were kept and maintained at the Fire Station, Gunnersbury Lane. The total number of premature live infants bom at home during 1951 was eight. Two of these were nursed entirely at home and survived the first month. The remaining six were transferred to hospital. All eight children were living at the end of the year. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued. One clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, South 18 Acton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. Nine patients were referred for advice in 1951. HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 10 Full-time Home Helps, and 41 Part-time Staff. The following Table shows the number of cases booked and those actually attended:— Maternity: Total number of cases booked 52 Number of cases attended 44 Number of cases cancelled 8 Tuberculosis cases attended 31 Other cases attended 199 DAY NURSERIES As indicated in my Annual Report for 1950, a Panel of members of each Area Health Committee of the Middlesex County Council was set up to review applications for retention in, or admission to, the Day Nurseries. This work has gone on steadily throughout the year, the Panel reporting to the Area Health Committee at regular intervals. The accommodation at the four Acton Day Nurseries is unchanged. The table below shows accommodation, numbers on the registers at 31st December, and average attendance throughout the year. Accommodation No. on Register at 31-12-51 Average Attendance Bollo Bridge Road 35 33 29 Horn Lane 60 62 38 Friars Place Lane 45 43 34 " Lonecot," Newton Grove 44 41 36 The attendance at Horn Lane shows a big decrease and this was due very largely to an outbreak of Sonne Dysentery which occurred in the Spring, and which necessitated the closure of the Nursery for a period of ten days. Following this a Measles epidemic accounted for a lowered attendance at all Nurseries. 19 SECTION D INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES, SCABIES AND OTHER CONDITIONS DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION Immunisation was carried out along the lines indicated in previous reports, the following routine being practised:— (1) A notice was sent to the parent of each 6 months old child. (2) All infant welfare attenders were approached. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were given protection. (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfare Centres, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer was in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases were followed up and, at the end of three years, each child was offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this was preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who had not had the disease, were inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they were inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e. they had three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. 58.02% of the population under 5 years of age, and 94.02% of the population aged 5 to 15 is now protected.

Of the total cases 975 were in respect of measles, an increase of 522 cases over last year. Diphtheria. There were no cases during the year; 2 patients suspected to be suffering from the disease were found after admission to hospital to be suffering from laryngitis and tonsillitis respectively. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers. The 2 cases of Typhoid Fever notified were members of one family—a mother and her child, aged 8. Although most extensive enquiries were made and many specimens were taken from contacts, the source of infection was not discovered. Of the two cases of Paratyphoid Fever one occurred in a girl aged 6. She was admitted to hospital because of pyrexia, which she had had for a week without any obvious cause. After laboratory investigations, paratyphoid was diagnosed and she was removed to an isolation hospital. The other case occurred in a woman, aged 54, but the diagnosis was open to doubt. In neither case could the source of infection be found, but there appeared to be no connexion between them. Food Poisoning. There was no outbreak of food poisoning during the year. Four single cases were notified, 3 of them being members of one family. In no case was it possible to identify the food causing the illness. Dysentery. Of the 67 cases of Dysentery notified, 29 cases were of children who attended Acton Day Nurseries; 21 of these cases occurred at Horn Lane Day Nursery during March. I closed the Nursery for a period of 10 days, after which no new cases were reported. Scarlet Fever. Cases continued to be of a mild character, 42 of the 72 notified being nursed at home. In most cases patients were only removed to hospital where the home conditions were such that they could not reasonably be treated or isolated at home.

(a) Completed and occupied 31.12.51:— 230 230 274 SECTION F SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Notifications of waste of water have been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 76 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of the water supply, have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. 27 Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. In the case of one well in a factory premises it was discovered that, while the well supply was satisfactory, storage conditions were adverse, and work of cleansing and some reconstruction of plant was effected to put the matter in order. In the course of the year a total of 100 samples of water were submitted to the Council's analyst or the pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Stormwater is filtered and emptied into the Thames. PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1951 was 16,541 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 867 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,861 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test treatment of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been continued in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff have been divided as occasion has demanded between disposal of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment, and the regular visiting examination and treatment of business premises. There is no serious infestation of rats or mice in the Borough, and there can be no doubt that this is largely due to the Council's policy and practice of maintenance treatment in business premises, Particularly those where food for human consumption is manufactured or stored. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 2,525 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,729 to business Premises, and 796 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES the number of factories in the Borough has lessened to 648, and these have been subject to inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and 28 regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been maintained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 78 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease.

During the 30 year 74 Notices were passed to the Town Clerk for work to be done in default of owners. The following table indicates the extensive and varied nature of the defects and dilapidations which have been made good following inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors. Sanitary dustbins provided 82 Yards paved or yard paving required 50 Insanitary forecourts remedied 4 Defective drains repaired or reconstructed 132 Defective soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired or renewed 29 Defective fresh air inlets repaired or renewed 22 Defective gullies removed and replaced by new 26 Rainwater downpipes disconnected from drain — Dishings or curb gully repaired or new gratings fixed 25 Defective W.C. pans and traps removed and replaced by new 56 Defective W.C. flushing apparatus repaired or new fixed 72 Defective W.C. seats repaired or new fixed 42 Defective flush pipe connections repaired 23 Insanitary sinks removed or new fixed 47 Sink waste pipes repaired or trapped 70 Insanitary wall surface over sinks remedied 23 Ventilated food cupboards provided 30 Drinking water cisterns cleansed 3 Defective covers to drinking water cisterns repaired or new fixed 5 Insanitary sites beneath floors concreted 5 Spaced beneath floors ventilated 49 Dampness in walls from defective damp proof coursing remedied 258 Dampness from defective roof, rainwater gutterings, etc, remedied 1,662 Defective plastering repaired (number of rooms) 1,441 Rooms where dirty walls and ceiling have been cleansed and redecorated 2,074 Defective floors repaired 273 Defective or dangerous stairs repaired 46 Defective doors and windows repaired 1,796 Defective kitchen ranges and firegrates repaired 400 31 Defective washing coppers repaired 16 Coal cupboards provided or repaired 3 Accumulations of offensive matter removed 18 Drains unstopped and cleansed 74 Drains tested, exposed for examination, etc. 287 Smoke observations taken 41 Smoke nuisances abated on service of notice 5 Miscellaneous nuisances abated 336 New W.C. apartments 5 RENT RESTRICTIONS ACT Certificates granted to occupiers 1 Certificates granted to owners 1 PREMISES UNDER PERIODICAL INSPECTION Factories and Workshops 648 Piggeries 3 Rag Dealers 4 Mews 4 Public House Urinals 31 Hairdressers 43 School Buildings:— Grammar 1; Primary and Secondary 11; Technical 2; Special 1; Private 3 Total 18 Butchers' Shops 38 Fish Shops 39 Fish and Chip Shops 15 Greengrocer's Shops 89 Premises where food is manufactured or prepared 43 Grocery and Provision Shops 154 Dairies 12 Bakehouses 25 Slaughterhouses 2 Restaurants, Cafes, etc. 129 Industrial Canteen 203 Premises where ice-cream is manufactured 11 Premises where ice-cream is sold 98 32 SECTION G INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD FOOD INSPECTION The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. Under the direction of the various Departments of the Minis4 try of Food, much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes subject to control by the Local Authority, and the Sanitary Inspectors carry out necessary examinations to ensure that only sound material is used; this accounts generally for the bulk surrenders. Two large wholesale grocery Depots are within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs:— Corned beef and mutton 235 lbs. Fresh meat, various 2,021 lbs. Tinned meat, various 2,255 tins Ham (tinned) 10,886 lbs. Bacon 39 lbs. Sausages 29 lbs. Rabbits, fresh 75 Bakers Sundries 152 lbs. Confectionery 26 lbs. Preserves, various 934 tins Fish 26 stone Fish 1,032 tins Fruit and vegetables, various 14,115 tins Rabbits (tinned) 68 tins Offal 49½ lbs. Chickens 19 Turkeys 3 33 Pastes, pickles, etc. 124 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 96 tins Milk, condensed 2,378 tins Milk, dried 20 cwts. Sugar 32 lbs. Tea 16 lbs. Shell eggs 60 Dried Fruit 1,216 lbs. Dried Fruit 79 packets Dried Fruit 17 boxes Coconut (dessicated) 8 lbs. Cereals, various 28 packets COMPLAINTS During the year there were 30 complaints as to unsound food or food not of the nature, quality or substance demanded, and in two cases the Council instituted Court Proceedings, resulting as follows:— A dairy delivering milk from outside the Borough was fined £15 for selling a pint bottle of milk containing foreign material showing a profuse growth of mould and bacteria. The Council were awarded ten guineas costs. A firm of grocers was fined £6 in respect of the sale in a local shop of two ounces of ham which was unsound and contained maggots and a dead blowfly. The Council were awarded three guineas costs. FOOD HYGIENE Following the Clean Food Exhibition held in 1950 lectures fllustrated by "Kodaslide" have been given by the Sanitary Inspectors, and have proved of great interest to those attending, who have included social groups, staffs of food premises, technical college students, and senior school children. MILK There has been no change in the number of establishments in the Borough where milk is bottled preparatory to local distribution, and the good standard of hygiene has been maintained, 84 Of 93 samples taken throughout the Borough and submitted to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, there was only one failure in respect of the methylene blue test, while all phosphatase tests were satisfactory. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and of the 38 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, 36 were found to be sterile. The remaining 2 were unsatisfactory, and on checking with the dairy laboratory it was found that the trouble was due to a temporary breakdown in detergent application to a bottle cleansing machine, which deficiency had been discovered by the dairy on examination of bottles which were 'side-by-side' sampled with those referred to in this report. ICE-CREAM The manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough remain at 11, while there are 98 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 280 samples were taken, 124 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 106 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in ice-cream manufactured outside the Borough. The grading of samples noted below and expressed in percentages indicates an improvement in the very good standard of ice-creams manufactured in the Borough. Grade I. 83.9% Grade II. 8.1% Grade III. 6.4% Grade IV. 1.6% Premises, plant, processing and storage conditions are well and satisfactorily maintained.

There was a slight increase in the number of horses slaughtered for human food at Hanbury Road, and the quality of the flesh was maintained. TOTAL NUMBER OF CARCASES INSPECTED WITH DETAILS.

On the 19th November, because of numerous outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease in north-east and eastern coastal areas, the Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries made a large controlled area under the Foot and Mouth Disease (Controlled Area Restrictions) General Order of 1938. On 20th November this area was extended to include Acton, and immediately the movement of all clovenhoofed animals into the Borough was controlled and could only be made on licences granted in accordance with the terms of the Order. This area was still scheduled at the end of the year, by which time the department had issued 1,528 movement licences, and 17,379 pigs had been moved into Walls' Slaughterhouse on licence. The work of issuing licences from the office, checking licences, inspecting animals and supervising the disinfection of vehicles at the Slaughterhouse, entailed the working of a considerable amount of overtime by members of the staff. There were 41 contraventions of the General Order. In the course of correspondence and investigation it appeared that none of these cases occurred as a result of deliberate intent but rather as results of errors or misunderstandings and in some cases through misinformation from official sources. In each case a warning letter was sent and acknowledged, and there were no further contraventions by the offenders. SECTION H ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION In February, seven atmospheric pollution stations were established in the Borough on sites selected in consultations with the Fuel Research Section of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Each station was equipped with one Lead Peroxide apparatus. Owing to delay in the supply of the Deposit Gauge 39 equipment, the three stations which were to be furnished with this apparatus were unable to commence operations until August. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The table on page 40 gives the monthly figures for each station in the Borough. The station with the highest average was Bashley Road (1.84), which also had the highest monthly reading, 2.93. That with the lowest average figure was Acacia Road (1.34), and that with the lowest monthly figure Kenday Avenue (0.35). For the purpose of comparison the monthly average figure for all stations is given in the form of a graph on page 41. DEPOSIT GAUGES The table on page 4*2 gives the monthly deposit of solids from the atmosphere in tons per square mile for the five months during which the gauges were in operation. The highest average monthly deposit (33.87) and highest month's deposit (44.65) were at Bashley Road, and the lowest monthly average and month's deposit were at Kendal Avenue (17.89 and 12.11). The graph on page 41 shows the comparison between the average monthly figures for the three stations. Of the total of 361 tons of material deposited per square mile at the three stations, some 21% or 76 tons, was classed as combustible material and may be accepted as an indication of wasting of fuel—irrespective of waste in gaseous form. 40 ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY LEAD PEROXIDE INSTRUMENTS Weight of SO2 in Milligrams per 100 Square Centimetres per day. 1951 Town Hall Canham Road Wells Hse.
