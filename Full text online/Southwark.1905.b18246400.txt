Sou 30 Borough of Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of health, for the YEAR 1905. G, Millson, Medical Officer of Health. london: T. Cornell & Sons, Commercial & General Printers, 63, Borough Road, S.E. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Nineteenth Annual Report on the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1905. With the exception of Measles and Diphtheria the mortality from infectious disease has been singularly low. The death-rate, for so densely populated an area as Southwark, is a matter for congratulation. The suckling of babies by the mother is almost universal throughout the Borough. The only cases in which that is not done is where the mother is physically incapable of producing the food for the infant. I am sure good serviceable work has been done by the sanitary staff during the year, which I am glad to thankfully acknowledge, I beg, also, to thank the Public Health Committee and the Council for their support and encouragement in the work. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. TABLE OF CONTENTS. page.

The deaths of Infants under one year of age to 1,000 births were 148 during the year 1905. The deaths under one year of age to 1,000 births for the last 13 years were as follows: 1893 178 1900 192 1894 163 1901 168 1895 201 1902 166 1896 192 1903 148 1897 187 1904 174 1898 190 1905 148 1899 199 6 During the year under consideration good progress has been made with the rebuilding on the Clandon Estate area. There are still portions of the estate, many acres in extent, which have simply been cleared of the old houses and are awaiting building operations. The houses already built comprise many different types. They are all well built, and appear to be in every way suitable for the class of persons about to occupy them. The rent which is reasonable for the accommodation provided, is beyond the capacity of the "unskilled" portion of the population to pay. The local management of the estate has been wisely placed in the hands of Miss Octavia Hill and her staff of ladies. This is not the only property similarly administered in the Borough, and I am able to say with the best results. The letting of property and the economic repairing of it need constant and close attention in this district if the homes of the people are to be kept clean and satisfactory. In St. Paul's Ward smallclass property of two floors has been extensively renewed. Much of the house property in the more residential part of the Borough which used to, be let to single tenants, is now let out in floors, a family to a floor. This kind of occupation, where the only supply of water is in the basement, hardly tends to the well-being and cleanliness of the family, especially where the cooking and other domestic matters have to be carried on in the tenement. We have been able during the year to get a large number of these houses provided with a water supply and a sink on each floor, which is much appreciated by the tenants. Within the last few years it is easy to see what a great change for the better has taken place in many parts of our neighbourhood by the clearing away of rookeries and slums of evil repute. Although much has been done we still have areas of a most insanitary character, notably that in connection with Tabard Street. I should be sorry to see it burned down or shaken by a small earthquake, but I am sure it requires something of a drastic nature to cure it of its many diseases. Much attention has been given in the year to the sampling of imported food stuffs the result of which can be seen by a reference to the tables in the report. POPULATION.

Of the 3,397 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,093 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 369 belonging to Southwark, and 724 to other boroughs of the metropolis. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,175. Of this very large number as many as 717 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 30'5. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

The deaths were more numerous in the Wards of St. Michael, St. George and St. Paul. The notifications showed 110 great fluctuation in the several months of the year. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year, numbered 11, as against 18 for 1904. The total number of cases notified was 74 for the present year, and 92 for 1901. The percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 14-8. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0-05. Deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years: 1896 26 1901 18 1897 21 1902 23 1898 20 1903 23 1899 32 1904 18 1900 39 1905 11 51 Of the 74 cases notified, as many as 67 were removed to hospital, with 7 deaths, a mortality of 10.4 per cent. 7 cases were treated at home, with 4 deaths, a mortality of 57.0 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 90.5. Cause of the disease:— Nine cases occurred in persons after eating mussels, and where no other food taken was in any way suspected. A group of six cases occurred in Aylesbury Street. The first case was the father who fell ill shortly after relaying a very offensive school drain. His wife and four children subsequently sickened, four with Enteric Fever, and one, a daughter, with severe diarrhæa only. Two children of two other families in the same street fell with the complaint;, and for some time it was difficult to connect the cases as any intercourse between the persons affected was stoutly denied. It was found out on persistent enquiry that the daughter of the first family attacked, who had severe diarrhea, had visited the second and third families, and must have infected them. In four cases cockles were strongly suspected in the absence of any other apparent cause. In nine cases a previous case in the house was most likely the cause. DIARRHAEA. The deaths during the year from this disease were 383, as against 282, 197, 169 and 222 for the four preceding years. This is an important decline, which I hope was largely due to more of our mothers breast.feeding their children. During the last few years we have flooded the district with literature urging upon mothers the necessity of such a practice We have also made personal visits to see if the infants were thriving. All this work. I feel, must have had some considerable effect in calling for more care in regard to infant life. Enquiry during the year was made at the end of the first three months of infant life in many thousand births, and it was found that 81.8 per cent, were breast.fed, 11.0 per cent, were partly breast.fed and partly hand.fed, and that 6.4 per cent, were entirely hand.fed. This shows a great improvement on the state of affairs which existed ten years ago. The Municipal Milk Depot question does not find much encouragement from the Council of this Borough. The annual rate per 1,000 living was 0.88. 52 Deaths from diarrhæa during the last ten years: 1896 214 1901 222 1897 300 1902 169 1898 306 1903 197 1899 260 1904 282 1900 233 1905 183 In every case of death from diarrhæa the house was examined, and the history of the case in regard to the feeding of the infant (when such deaths occurred in infants) was reported upon, together with the cleanliness of the home and the habits of the parents. Directions will be again issued this summer to prevent as far as possible infantile diarrhæa. TYPHUS FEVER. No death has occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 154, as against 191, 83, 164 and 161 for the four preceding years. The Wards chiefly affected were those of All Saints, St. Peter, St. John and St. Michael. The death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.74. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years: — 1896 192 1901 161 1897 184 1902 164 1898 145 1903 83 1899 171 1904 191 1900 116 1905 154 WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 80, as against 118, 68, 114 and 98 in the four preceding years. The Wards of St. George, St. John and St. Michael, in the orde named, were those most affected. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.38. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years — 1896 140 1901 98 1897 126 1902 114 1898 93 1903 68 1899 146 1904 118 1900 120 1905 80 53 TABLE 31.

The following Report was made to the Public Health Committee:— 6th March, 1905. To the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, I have to report that we are receiving, under the General Powers Act of 1904, notice of many cases of verminous rooms, persons and bedding. We have experienced lately the greatest difficulty with regard to the cleansing of the occupants of the rooms when many children are concerned. It is necessary to have them removed to the Reception House whilst their rooms are being fumigated and themselves cleansed. It is unfortunate that we are compelled to bring these verminous people into the Reception House which ought never to be used for such a purpose. There is a distinct risk of cleanly people who reside in the 58 Beception House whilst their rooms are being disinfected after Infectious Disease, getting vermin upon their person during their residence. This cleansing of persons and rooms is a very important duty that the Local Authority has to perform, and I would advise a house being taken until a proper building can be put up. ("Signed) G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. (Since this report was written the Council have decided to fit up a Bath Boom adjoining the Beception House which will remove the danger referred to in the report.) TABLE 36 MORTUARIES.

It will be seen that an order made by the Magistrate on the relieving officer to bury will tend to weaken the obligation that friends have of burying the bodies of their relatives, and so a serious burden of expense is likely to be cast upon the rates. In most cases the friends of dead relatives will bury the body if they are given sufficient time to collect the money, or to obtain the necessary funds in other ways. This difficulty of detention is to be surmounted by providing the water-tight metal chests which exist in other mortuaries. In these chests the bodies could be retained for any length of time without danger to the Public Health, and to the avoidance of expense and scandal to the Public Authorities." (Since writing this report a metal air-tight tank has been provided at each Mortuary.) TABLE 37. WATER SUPPLY. Water supplies have been laid on to houses in the Borough after having been withdrawn as follows :— WARDS. St. Mary's. St. Paul's. St. Peter's. St. John's. Trinity. All Saints'. St. Michael's.

In January notices were served with the object of getting the houses in the above Court closed on representation made by the Medical Officer of Health under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The Magistrate at the hearing decided to view the premises. Having done so on the 7th February he gave his decision, that the houses were not in such a state as to justify him in making a closing order. The Magistrate therefore dismissed the summons with £5 15s. 0d. costs against the Council. He thought that, with certain alterations made by the landlords so as to secure through ventilation in the rooms of the houses, the houses in respect to healthiness would be much improved. Report on Nos. 60 to 70 Tabard Street. The following Report was submitted to the Public Health Committee : — " The houses numbered 60 to 70, Tabard Street are, with the exception of No. 70, which is wholly brick, partly brick and partly wooden in structure. There are three habitable floors with a cellar beneath. On the ground floor there is a large room in the front 10 feet by 16 feet, and a smaller room at the back 8 feet by 8 feet. The smaller room at the back has running on two sides of it a passage leading from the front entrance into the yard at the rear. The yard is 20 feet by 9 feet and there is a washhouse 12 feet by 4 feet. There is one water-closet for the whole house. The water is obtained from a stand-pipe in the yard and there is no water supply on either the first or second floors. On the first floor there are two rooms each 14 feet square, and a garret above of one room 14 feet square and 6 feet 6 inches high. All the other rooms exceed 8 feet in height. The staircase is old and dilapidated. The walls of the rooms are in fairly good condition and are colour-washed. The arrangement on the ground floor whereby a passage is provided, renders that and the back room dark. The rooms in nearly all the cases are let furnished and separately occupied. The residents are of the lowest of the casual class. These rooms like the other furnished rooms in Tabard Street, are often let to persons of immoral character. Cases of overcrowding frequently occur which are dealt with by the Lady Inspector. The general sanitary condition of the premises is fair, the rooms are clean and the sanitary appliances are in good order. The worst features are the ill-arrangement of the rooms on the ground floor and the unsatisfactory character of the people living in the houses. I should like to see houses of this description closed, but I am unable, owing to the cleanly way in which they are kept, to recommend the Committee to issue notices with that object, as I feel satisfied that we should be defeated in such attempt" 61 PHYSICAL DETERIORATION. From time to time, in a more or less sporadic way, small portions of the population of this country have been examined as to height and weight at certain ages. The number taken on each occasion was far too small to enable an effective comparison being made. To state the general result, it was found on comparing the two extreme classes, that the average stature of boys in our public schools was five inches more than that of boys of the same age in industrial schools. Unfortunately, we are bound to admit in the consideration of this matter of physical deterioration that, at the present time, we have no data by which an accurate comparison can be made of large sections of the various classes at certain ages of the population in regard to height, weight, chest measurement, breadth of shoulders, breadth of hips, and, what is most important, size of the jaws, at the present time and the period of, say 50 years ago. We are, therefore, thrown upon our own individual experiences for an opinion as to the amount of degeneration which is going on in the race at the present time. I do not believe that any one is disposed to admit that the fine young men and women of the upper and middle classes we see around us, as a whole, show any signs of degeneracy. On the contrary they appear to me by their athletic habits, to be more vigorous and healthy than those of a quarter of a century ago. I am sorry that we cannot say as much for the non-technical and casual labour classes in our large and crowded commercial centres. The most casual observer, whose duty it is to reside or work among these sections, cannot fail to be deeply impressed by the fearful waste of human life that is occurring and which is brought about largely by the filthy, drunken, and careless habits of the people. These habits have been largely induced by parental neglect, and by the failure to equip the male portion in early life with a trade or calling which will develop and maintain them as respectable citizens. It has been said over and over again by all our best authorities on the subject, and I am sure we are pleased to second it, that among the lower classes of the population the three or four years immediately succeeding a boy's elementary school life effectually determine his character, career and future prospects. The boy who is turned upon the street to get his living at 14 years of age, or who takes to such casual vocations for which he is unfitted at the age of 18, runs a great chance of finding himself in the ranks of the great army of undesirables when he has reached manhood. Many of these join the Services, and as many of them are the product of the same unfortunate class, they are often tainted with disease that physically unfits them for sustained labour. It was in consequence of the gloomy reports sent home 62 of the feeble physical condition of many of the young recruits serving during the late war in South Africa that public attention was directed to the matter. The sense of uneasiness was much increased by an article on the national health published in the Contemporary Review of January, 1902, by Sir Frederick Maurice, whose duty it had been for many years to visit the Herbert Hospital, at Woolwich, which takes in the sick of the Woolwich garrison and men belonging to the artillery invalided from abroad. He was called upon to sanction the discharge from the army of men brought forward by a medical board as unfit for service. On his examination he found that sixty per cent, of those wishing to be soldiers were found physically unfit after two years' service. He traced the cause (1) to heart disease, pulmonary troubles and rheumatism, due to a low anæmic condition consequent on a poor development of the body (2) to fiat feet arising from badly constructed shoes, (3) to bad teeth, the outcome of improper feeding in infancy, and bad management by ignorant mothers, and (i) to early marriages in unsuitable subjects. Among other causes he pointed to the continual rush of the people from rural districts to towns, where the pay was insufficient to support them, and to the unhealthy condition of crowded towns generally for those ill-fed, and compelled to live under insanitary conditions. He emphasised what has been so often said, that it is to the healthy, mental, moral and physical condition of the women and children we must look, if our race is to be properly maintained. In March, 1902, a Royal Commission was appointed, with the Earl of Mansfield as chairman, to inquire into the opportunities for physical training available in the State-aided schools and other educational institutions in Scotland. The Commission took a mass of evidence, but were unable to come to any definite decision as to whether or not there exists a progressive deterioration of the slum population of Great Britain generally, or of its large towns as a whole. They found, however, that there was ample evidence of an undeniable degeneration of individuals of the classes in which food and environment are defective, calling for attention in obvious ways, one of which is the provision of a well regulated system of physical training. Dr. Don, deputy surgeon general, and senior medical officer of the London Recruiting Station, when before this Commission said:— "I am convinced that judicious physical and military drill, if combined with sufficient food and heathy environment, will signally contribute to the moral as well as the better physical development of boyhood and early manhood." He laid stress on the fact that physical training should be accompanied by sufficient food if good results were to be obtained. The publication of this report from Scotland on physical training produced a great impression on the public mind in England. Questions were asked in 63 Parliament on the subject. In April, 1903, the Director General of the Army Medical Service, in a memorandum on the physical fitness of men offering themselves for enlistment in the army, pointed out that in spite of the large proportion of men found physically unfit for service, the public health Statistics appear to show progressive improvement in the national health, and that feats of strength, agility, and endurance point, at any rate, to an improvement in the physique in the well-to-do classes. He went on to state that at the last census 25 millions of the 32½ millions live in towns, the town population having increased 15 per cent, in the last decade, that the bulk of our soldiers are drawn from the class of unskilled labourers from the towns, and that the highest number of rejections are among men employed in indoor occupations. That the deterioration of the physique of the urban poor is attributed to insufficient and poor quality of food, defective housing, overcrowding, and insanitary surroundings. Of the 77 per cent, of the population estimated to live in towns, about 25 per cent, would appear on trustworthy investigations, to be not only poor, but living in such poverty as to be unable to rear their children under conditions favourable to health and physical fitness. In the autumn of 1903, Parliament appointed an inter-departmental committee on physical deterioration which held its first meeting in December of that year. The evidence taken before the Commission is contained in a bulky volume of some 500 pages. The evidence given by Dr. Eichholz is so excellent throughout, when he speaks of the condition of school children, that it is almost impossible to refrain from quoting it in detail. He thinks that the condition of some of the children in our poor schools portrays a serious condition of affairs brought about by the absence of proper food and clothing, the presence of overcrowding, drunkenness in the parent, uncleanliness, and general lack of practical knowledge in home management. In his general evidence he says:— "there is in the nation an upper class well-to-do and well cared for, to whom our methods afford every chance of mental and physical improvement. They come out well, and furnish a population probably not excelled by any in this country or any other. At the other end of the scale we find the aggregation of slum population, ill-nourished, poor, and badly housed. They are the degenerates for whom this enquiry is presumably instituted. Between these two is the third and largest stratum consisting, of an average industrial artisan population, in which the bread winners are in regular employment. It is the aggregation of the slum population which is largely responsible for the prominent public notice called to their physical condition." Dr. Colley says:—"Physical infirmity is practically confined to the poor and lowest strata of the population, whose children are improperly and insufficiently fed and 64 inadequately housed, and where the parents are improvident, idle and intemperate." The whole of the evidence given before the Commission on this physical deterioration shows that the casual labour class of the population are sadly defective in their mental, moral and physical conditions, and that unless remedies are provided they will, in the future, be a serious menace to the State. The death rate of England and Wales during the last half century has fallen six per thousand. The death rate for London, which was 24.8 in the censal period of 1841-50, declined in 1904 to 16.1, whilst the birth rate in London was for the same periods, 1841-50, 33.6, and in 1904 27.4. The marriages, which were in 1851-60 20.6 per 1,000 living, declined in 1904 to 17 per 1,000. The marriages have taken place earlier in life in London and later in the country. Phthisis, which is the scourge of slum populations, has declined in the whole of England and Wales by 50 per cent., and in London 40 per cent, during the last fifty years. These reductions in the death rates we may fairly assume have been brought about by improved methods in private and public health, the better feeding of the people attainable by higher wages, and, let us hope, to the improvement in the habits, exercise and cleanliness of the community generally. In the infant mortality rate there is not seen to be any decline, for up to 1900 the rate was the same. In the years since 1900 there has been a small decline due to exceptional circumstances. Southwark, in regard to its infant rate, if not the worst in the metropolis, is among the the three placed at the bottom of the scale. One-third of the total infant deaths, that is deaths under one year of age, occur under one month, and more than 65 per cent, of these die within the first week of life. An illegitimate child in London has only half the chance that a legitimate one has of seeing its first anniversary. The percentage of illegitimate births to the total births for 1905 in Southwark was 2 2. The causes which produce this high mortality in infants are (1) hereditary taint; (2) employment of mothers late in pregnancy and too soon after child birth ; (3) the decrease in breast feeding; (4) defective milk supply; (5) parental ignorance and neglect; (6) the drink habit in the parents ; (7) the overlaying of infants; (8) the overcrowding in the dwelling; and (9) insanitary conditions. The remedies are the better housing, the better feeding, and the moral and intellectual elevation of the masses. To attain these desirable objects milk depots and creches should be established. There is a great necessity in London for the supply of clean country milk properly cooled whilst in transit. It is also necessary that there should be great reforms in the condition of the dairies and cowsheds of the country, the greater part of 65 which are at the present time in a very insanitary and dirty condition. I have advised the Borough Council to undertake this sale of clean milk, which I am sure would assist considerably in the diminution of this high infant mortality. For years past the Council of the Borough has issued a circular to mothers on how to feed infants, recommending among other things that mothers, as much as possible, should breast-feed their children. Last year a very large percentage of the children born in Southwark were periodically visited by our lady inspectors, and from their reports I find that 81.8 per cent, of all the children visited were breast fed, 11 per cent, were partly breast fed and partly hand fed, and only 6.4 were entirely hand fed. I expect if we can only keep up this high percentage of breast fed children in the future we shall see a large diminution in the infant mortality. With regard to the overcrowding of our tenements in the Borough, it is impossible to prevent much of what now exists, as long as Southwark remains the home of the "undesirables," and as long as such manufacture continues. This overcrowding is always accompanied by uncleanliness, foul air and bad insanitary conditions. The standards of 300 cubic feet for adults, and 200 for children in sleeping rooms are not sufficient, unless good ventilation is well maintained. Therefore the sleeping with open windows is a necessity for good health. In the census of 1901 it was found that 22.35 per cent, of the population of Southwark lived in a state of overcrowdedness, that is, had more than two persons to each room; 9,896 persons out of a population of 206,180 also lived in single room tenements. Although there is a reduction in the overcrowdedness by some 5 per cent, on the figures of the census of 1891, it must still be considered excessive. Sir Benjamin Richardson's estimate for his City of Hygeia was 25 persons per acre. In Southwark there is an average of 182 persons to the acre, and in some parts near the Old Kent Road there are as many as 281 to the acre. The Southwark Borough Council issued a short time ago a circular on the evil effects of alcohol when taken in excess, or even when taken very moderately as a beverage. The lamentable diseases it induces and the wreckage and degradation it causes, call for strenuous efforts on the part of everyone to combat this grave evil. It is very difficult to convince people that a small amount of alcohol, if regularly taken, has a decidedly bad effect on the constitution. It is easier for anyone to prove for himself how much better he is for work and how much his temper is improved by abstaining from alcohol altogether. For the excessive drinker his only hope of salvation is in total abstinence. Alcohol is in no sense a food, it cannot repair our tissues, and therefore it cannot benefit us during continued fatigue. 66 With regard to the education of children in elementary schools this subject has been before most of the health officers during the last year. We are decidedly of opinion that a child under the age of five years should not be allowed to attend school. We are also of opinion that children in these elementary schools are being taught a multitude of abstruse subjects which are positively harmful to their proper education, and many of which subjects might with advantage to the intellects of the children be discontinued. Brain fag in children is a well recognised complaint, and due largely to the system of education now in vogue. With regard to the underfed children attending school the opinion is strongly held that the aid of the State should only be called in after all charitable resources have been exhausted. I should like to acknowledge the good that is being done in this direction by the Rev. Canon Horsley and others working on the same lines. With regard to the food of the people in the poorer districts, this is often found, if not distinctly prejudicial, to be unsuitable in character. The varied dietary of the well-todo classes in this country is acknowledged to be the best in the world. In no other country is food so excellent nor so cheap. A wholly vegetable and fruit diet may be found beneficial for those taking little physical exercise, but for the man who has to undertake heavy, or even moderate labour the ordinary mixed diet is by far the best. The poorer classes in regard to food are very wasteful both in the purchase and in the cooking of it. They do not buy the foods that according to price give the best results. With the limited money at their command this is a vital matter for them. White bread, beef, mutton and tea, as the main portions of a dietary, rank far below brown bread, porridge, bacon, cheese and milk. I advise a circular being distributed throughout the district setting out clearly the dietaries most suitable for the maintenance of health of those of poor means. Having briefly passed under review some of the many causes affecting public health, I should like for a moment or two to consider what are the remedies for some of the more important of the evils. The question of the casual labourer stands out prominently. Without the means to earn sufficient money for the proper maintenance of himself and his family he is a prey to overcrowding, semi-starvation, disease and all the host of evils associated with the squalid poor. As I have said before, the important time of a boy's life is the four years following his elementary school life. The old system of apprenticeship which is now dead, had many advantages. It not only taught a boy a trade, but it subjected him to a discipline which tended to make him a good citizen. Our Polytechnics, though splendid institutions, are concerned almost exclusively in improving young men already engaged in 67 their trades. They do not receive ordinary lads who have not commenced any technical training. In some of the great commercial centres in France there are trade schools ready to receive boys without any technical training, who are taught, during a period of three or four years, everything necessary for their equipment as craftsmen. The old custom among the Germans, from the sovereign downwards, to learn a trade was a very excellent one. In Germany the boys attend school up to seventeen years of age, and in Switzerland until eighteen years of age, the later years being spent in learning a trade. This compulsory teaching of a trade, which would have to be worked in conjunction with the trades unions, appears to me to be the only way of stopping the present manufacture of the undesirab'e casual portion of the population, or those who by the absence of any early training never have worked and never will work. With regard to the treatment of the residuum, or unemployable of the population, additional powers of a compulsory character will have to be obtained from Parliament,. I do not think the sending of the father of the family away to a trade colony is likely to prove a great success. Some endeavour should be made, I think, to plant families in their entirety upon the land, something after the fashion of what Lord Carrington has done with his small holdings, which have proved so successful. This planting of families on the land has its limits. When we consider that upwards of 60,000 persons are added every year to our London population the struggle for existence among the abjectly poor must be terrible. The idea of any legal restriction in the families of the destitute class of the population is a distasteful subject to talk about. We ought to institute in our district a health association of ladies similar to what is now in vogue in Manchester and Salford, Liverpool and Birmingham, where these associations have proved so beneficial. This association, with a lady superintendent at its head, should be in close touch with all the district visitors and officers in connection with our institutions. The object would be to influence by their personal attention and by the distribution of literature on food questions and on house management the female portion of the population. We should then have the institutions and the sanitary authority working closely together. We must acknowledge that we are passing through a period of great social and economic change, which I believe must tend to the ultimate good of our race and our country. 68 ALCOHOLISM. The following translation of a Government document which is posted up in all the public offices in France was widely distributed throughout the Borough of Southwark. During the year a copy was left twice at every tenement in the district, whilst large circulars were posted in prominent parts of the Borough— "Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. PHYSICAL DETERIORATION AND ALCOHOLISM. The Report of the Committee, presented to Parliament, by command of His Majesty, states that:— The abuse of alcoholic stimulants is a most potent and deadly agent of physical deterioration. Alcoholic persons are specially liable to Tuberculosis and all inflammatory disorders. Evidence was placed before the Committee showing that in abstinence is to be sought the source of muscular vigour and activity. Certain Insurance Tables show that of 61,215 men, between the ages of 25 and 65, 1,000 die in one year, but in abstainers only 560 die in the same period. The lunacy figures show a large and increasing number of admissions of both sexes which are due to drink. The following facts recognised by the medical profession are published in order to carry out the recommendation of the Committee and to bring home to men and women the fatal effects of alcohol on physical efficiency. (1) Alcoholism is a chronic poisoning, resulting from the habitual use of alcohol (whether as spirits, wine or beer) which may never go as far as drunkenness. (2) It is a mistake to say that those doing hard work require stimulants. As a fact no one requires alcohol as either food or tonic. (3) Alcohol is in no sense a food and cannot repair the tissues. It is really a narcotic, dulling the nerves like laudanum or opium, but it is more dangerous than either in that often its first effect is to weaken a man's self-control whilst his passions are excited; hence the number of crimes which occur under its influence. 69 (4) Spirits as usually taken rapidly produce alcoholism, but milder alcoholic drinks as beer, and even cider, drunk repeatedly every day produce after a time alcoholic poisoning with equal certainty. (5) The habit of drinking leads to disgust for work, the ruin of families, the neglect of social duties, misery, theft and crime. It leads also to the hospital, for alcohol produces the most varied and the most fatal diseases, including Paralysis, Insanity, diseases of the stomach and liver, and Dropsy. It also paves the way to Consumption, and frequenters of public houses furnish a large proportion of the victims of this disease. It complicates and aggravates all acute diseases; Typhoid Fever, Pneumonia and Erysipelas are rapidly fatal in the subject of alcoholism. (6) The sins of alcoholic parents are visited on the children ; if these survive infancy they are threatened with Idiocy or Epilepsy, and many are carried away by Tuberculous Meningitis or Phthisis (Consumption). (7) In short, alcoholism is the most terrible enemy to personal health, to family happiness, and to national prosperity. Remedy for Alcoholism. Total abstinence from all alcohol.

Town Hall, Walworth Road. 70 The following drainage ease is worthy of being recorded Drainage of Hayles Buildings. This case came before Mr. Francis on February 3rd, on a summons taken out by Mr. Long for the Southwark Borough Council against the Trustees of the Hayles Estate (a Lambeth Parochial Charity), complaining that the drain serving Nos. 13 to 22, one of a number of blocks of tenements in St. George's Road, Southwark, of which the Trustees are the owners, was defective. Evidence was given by the Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspector, that the examination of the drainage arose on a case of Diphtheria which occurred at No. 54, on November 1st, 1903. The drains were tested by water at the Medical Officer of Health's request, the Block tested numbering from 53 to 62. The drains were found very defective and great leakage occurred. The drains of Block 64 to 88 were also water tested and found very defective, as were also the drains of Block 13 to 22. Communications took place between Messrs. Waring & Nicholson, agents to the Trustees, and the Medical Officer of Health for the Council, in which Messrs. Waring & Nicholson stated that the drains were sound, and they continued their assertion in regard to Block 64 to 88. When these drains were opened and water tested, the water escaped and filled the trench. The soil under the pipes was found to be blackened with sewage. The main drain of Block 64 to 88 was amended and made sound, but with regard to the drainage of the other blocks, all of which were found to be leaky on applying the water test, the Trustees refused to repair them. In the application of the water test no more pressure was put upon them than would occur if the drains were blocked at the lowest point in the ordinary way with sewage. The head of water in any case was never more than two feet. The testing of the drainage, the case in relation to which came before the Court, was on November 24th, 1903, and was made by Mr. Hyde in the presence of the Medical Officer. The attempt to fill the drain with water failed as the water escaped from the drain and ran freely through the wall of the chamber. Mr. Francis adjourned the hearing of the summons on February 3rd for 14 days, so that the drain might be uncovered in the meanwhile, to enable both parties to inspect its condition. In the inspection of the uncovered drain every obstacle was placed in the way of the Borough 71 officials by the defendants and their witnesses to a proper examination, and only two joints in the drain were thoroughly exposed. The two joints in question were found to have blackened earth beneath them and to leak. On the resumed hearing on February 17th, the Trustees argued that the water test which was originally applied was not a fair one for an old drain such as this was, and that the drain was a good one for all practical purposes. The Borough Medical Officer gave evidence at some length, as to the conditions which he found when the drain was opened for inspection, and said he came to the conclusion that it was defective. For the defence Dr. J. Priestley, Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth, stated that although a drain might leak under water pressure it would not necessarily leak in ordinary use. His Council had passed a resolution that the water test should not be applied to old drains, except with the consent of the owner. At this stage the case was further adjourned for 7 days at the request of the defendants, in order that the Magistrate might examine the defective drain, which he did on Saturday, February 18th. On the adjourned hearing on 24th February, the defendants' counsel intimated that if it was understood that the rights of the Trustees were not to be prejudiced as regards the remainder of their drains, they would be prepared to meet the Borough Council in regard to this particular drain. The Magistrate stated "that he felt that the defendants had approached the matter in a very proper spirit. He had seen the drain and had come to the conclusion that it was defective. How soon that defect (and all these cases must be a matter of degree), small though it is now, might develop into a serious one, no human being could tell. How soon a drain would give out when once it leaked it was imposible to form any accurate opinion. It depends entirely upon the pressure put upon it, and so forth.'' Defendant's counsel said he did not think it would be necessary to ask the Magistrate to come to a finding in regard to this particular case one way or the other. What he was anxious about was the attack upon the drains of these buildings generally. The Council contended that the Public Health Act of 1891 was sufficient, practically to enable them to cause drains laid under their own supervision in 1883 to be now replaced by drains which would stand the water test, of course his contention would be that they could not do that. Mr. Topham, Solicitor for the Borough Council, said he was told by the Medical Officer of Health that it was not proposed to take similar proceedings to these in regard to any of the other drains, and the Medical Officer had instructed him to say that he was willing to give an undertaking that the water test should not be applied to the Trustees' drains 72 in future without notice. The Magistrate remarked that there appeared to be a great deal of conflict as to the water test. He believed that some of the most experienced civil engineers thought that it was a proper test. On the other hand, there were a great many who thought that it was too severe a test to apply to an old drain. Old drains very often answered their purpose without in any way being defective or causing a nuisance, but they would not stand the severe water test now applied to new drains. He should have thought the Borough Council as a public authority, would undertake that they would not apply that test without giving notice to the owner. The Borough Solicitor stated that the Borough Council were now prepared to do that with regard to Hayles' Trustees. The Magistrate said he was sure that the gentlemen constituting the Trustees, if they were satisfied that a nuisance existed or was likely to exist, would be the first persons to see that the health of the numerous families in the dwellings was not in danger. The further hearing of the summons was adjourned sine die, upon the undertaking of the defendants to properly repair and make good the drain. Queen's Buildings. The occupation of the basement rooms of these dwellings, which are generally so dark as to require always the use of artificial light, has been for years past the subject of constant complaint. Various reports have been made by me, and action taken by the Council, yet still they are very undesirable places for families to inhabit. The following report, made at the latter end of the year, shows how matters stood then:— "I am submitting a detailed report of the number of persons living in, and the conditions of occupation of the basement dwellings of Queen's Buildings. It will be in the remembrance of the Committee that some two years ago a communication was sent to the owners of these buildings pointing out how undesirable it was for these dark and consequently dirty basement rooms to be occupied by children. A reply to this communication was received from the managers of the buildings to the effect that in future families having children would not be allowed to occupy them. It will be seen by the report that at the present time in the basement dwellings of the ordinary blocks A to L nine of the basement tenements are now occupied by children. In regard to the cellar dwellings of Scovell Road, with the exception of Nos. 285 and 273, all the rest of the cellar dwellings are used chiefly as washhouses. 73 In Collinson Street the basement rooms have, by the means of staircases, been connected with those of the ground floor, the two being let as one occupation. This has been done to avoid the Public Health Act in regard to underground rooms. I find, however, that in two cases the basement proper has been sub-let to other families, and so has contravened Section 96 of the Public Health Act. The basement dwellings of the blocks A to L have not the surface of the floors of any of the rooms more than three feet below the surface of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to them. They are therefore not underground rooms as defined by the 96th Section of the Public Health Act. With regard to the basement rooms in Collinson Street only those separately occupied can be brought under the operation of the Section on underground rooms. I advise that, unless the Managers of these buildings are prepared to abide by the previous arrangement not to allow any children to occupy these dark and dirty basements in the blocks, some of the worst tenements in regard to light and ventilation be taken under Section 2 before the Magistrate for his decision. The same remarks would apply to the cellar dwellings in Collinson Street when both basement and ground floors are occupied by one family. In regard to the basement being occupied in contravention of Section 96, notices will be at once served upon them. Although, as a whole, these basement dwellings are quite unfit to be used as dwellings, I would advise the Committee to proceed in the way I have pointed out." Report on the King's Court Area. The following report was submitted to the Public Health Committee :— In accordance with the request of the Public Health Committee, I beg to submit a report on the structural condition and general sanitary state of the houses, with statistics in relation to the population of the Courts contained in the area which is bounded on the North by Suffolk Grove, and on the East by Southwark Bridge Road, and od the West by Great Suffolk Street. This area, which was represented under the Housing of the Working Classes Act some seven years ago by the late Medical Officer of Health for the parish of St. George the Martyr, has been variously named and sub-divided. I am disposed to apply the name King's Court Area to the space included in the above-mentioned boundaries. 74 The area has a population of 872 persons, with an acreage of 2 acres 12 perches and 20 yards, making a population to the acre of over 400 persons. There are 177 houses, each tenement in Victoria Buildings being reckoned as one house. The death.rate shown in the table submitted for the years 1901.4 was respectively 24 0, 26.3, 27.5 and 22.9, making an average death.rate for the four years of 25.1, against an average death.rate for the same period of 19.4 for St. Mary.s Ward, 16.2 St. Paul.s Ward, 191 St. Peter.s. 21.0 St. John.s, 19 5 Trinity, 21.4 All Saints, 23.1 St. Michael.s, 18.5 St. Tude.s, 22.1 St. George.s, 22.0 Christchurch, 20 4 St. Saviour.s and 20.3 for the whole Borough. The number of cases of Infectious Disease notified for the years 1901.4 was 40, making a yearly average for the four years of ll.4 per 1,000, which is about the same as that of the Borough. The average death.rate for the four years for the seven principal Zymotic Diseases was 6.0 per 1,000 of the population in this area as compared with 2.79 for the whole Borough, and for Phthisis 3.7, against 2.4 for the Borough. In describing the structural condition of the houses, the area may be divided into three parts— (1) that portion bounded on the North by the Fire Brigade Station and Suffolk Grove, and on the South by Lant Place, having an area of 1 rood 15 perches 6 yards, which may be termed the Grotto Place Sub.Area; (2) the portion containing Princess Place and Caffrey Place bounded on the North by the houses in Suffolk Grove, on the West by the houses in Great Suffolk Street, and on the East by the houses in King.s Court, having an area of 1 rood 4 perches 2 yards, which may be termed the Princess Place Sub.Area; and (3) the remaining portion comprising King.s Court and Queen.s Court, the West side of Sturge Street and the North side of Great Suffolk Street from No. 85 to 106, with 19 to 21, Lant Place, and having an area of 1 acre 1 rood 33 perches and 12 yards. In the Grotto Place Sub.Area the houses, with the exception of 1 to 5, Lant Place, are of the two.room type, the ground floor room and a bed room above, the floor space of the rooms averaging 10 square feet, the rooms having generally a height of 7 feet; with a very small yard and washhouse at the back. The brickwork and structure of the houses is in an indifferent state of repair, in fact worn out. The courts of this sub.area are from 3 to 6 feet wide and open at one end only. The water.closet accommodation is fair, but the drainage generally is defective. The narrowness of the courts and the high wall at the North side prevent proper ventilation and restrict the light to the sub.area. Upon this sub.area there are 42 houses and a population of 188 persons. The death.rate for 1901.4 was respectively 58.5, 15.9, 21.2 and 47.8, making an average for the four years of 35.8 per 1,000. 75 In the Princess Place Sub.Area the houses, with the exception of No. 21 Princess Place, are of the two.room type, one room above the other, each having a floor space of 10 square feet and a height of 7 feet. There is a small washhouse and a very small yard in connection with each. The rooms in the houses in Caffrey Place are less that 7 feet high and the house structure is very dilapidated. The structure of the houses in Princess Place is in better condition, but not satisfactory. The courts average a width of 12 feet and are only open at one end, the blind end abutting on warehouses. Each house has a water.closet in a good state of repair. The population is 115 persons and the death.rate for the four years 1901.4, was respectively 17.3, 17.3, 52.1 and 26.0, making an average of 28.1 per 1,000. The houses in the remaining portion of the King.s Court Area, with the exception of those in Sturge Street and Great Suffolk Street, with four in Queen.s Court, are one.storey dwellings contained in King.s Court and Queen.s Court. These one.floor dwellings have two rooms, 8 and 10 feet square, and open on to a common yard at the rear in which one water.closet for two dwellings is situated. The King and Queen.s Courts are 22 feet wide. With dwarf buildings of this kind there is sufficient light and ventilation. In Sturge Street the houses are of two.storeys, and consist of four rooms, excepting Nos. 10, 11 and 17, which are rather larger. The rooms average from 11 to 12 feet square with a height of 8 feet for the lower rooms and 7 feet for the upper. The structure of the houses is fair and the sanitary appliances are in good order. Each has a small washhouse and a back yard. The houses in Great Suffolk Street are three storeys high, and the lower storey in the houses 106 to 92, with the exception of the "Moonrakers" P.H. and the Victoria Model Dwellings, are used as shops, with a small room at the back. The remaining houses from 91 to 85 are three storey private houses, each having a cellar basement with two rooms on each floor. The lower storey of No. 85 is divided between a private room and a barber.s shop. The houses are old, but in a fair state of repair, possessing all the necessary sanitary appliances, with a small yard and washhouse at the back. There is no deficiency in regard to the light and ventilation of the Sturge Street houses or those in Great Suffolk Street. In the four years 1901.4, 402 notices were served in connection with the houses in King.s Court Area, of which 91 were for drainage, 55 for cleansing alone, and 127 for defective water.closet appliances, yard paving, roofs, &c., with the cleansing of the premises. 76 With regard to the two sub-areas, Grotto Place and Princess Place, there can hardly be two opinions as to the desirability of getting rid of them, both from the high death-rate that is present among the population and the closeness of the courts which are narrow and closed at one end, and therefore do not admit through ventilation. In the other portion of the main area, although King's Court and Queen's Court are wide and the houses have plenty of light and air, the buildings are of such a depraved type that I think this portion should be included in any scheme. Further, in consideration of a scheme for clearing an area, it would hardly be practicable to cut out the portion I have mentioned, leaving a total absence of frontage which is given by the inclusion of the one side of Sturge Street and the portion of Great Suffolk Street. The Victoria Buildings and the " Moonrakers" P.H. should be omitted from the scheme. To take Grotto Place Sub-Area alone under a scheme would do but little good as the area is so small, and to take it under Section 32 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act to close and demolish the houses would hardly meet the case, as the owners would simply rebuild without very much modification. I have thought carefully over this matter, and I am of opinion that any scheme proposed for the amelioration of the conditions present in this district should embrace the largest area, that is the King's Court Area. 77 TABLE 38.

The following report was submitted to the Public Health Committee:— The Report on the condition of the "Provided" and " Non- provided'' Schools shews that the public schools of the Borough at the present time are in a highly satisfactory condition. In the whole Borough there were only three schools found, after a severe examination, to require reconstruction of the drainage. In the group of " Non-provided " Schools, which number twenty-four, one school is about to be closed and the drainage was not examined, eight require slight amendment of the drainage, six require important amendment, two require reconstruction, and seven are in perfect order. Of the "Provided" schools, the number of which is twenty- nine, seven require slight amendment of the drainage, two require important amendment, one requires reconstruction of the drainage, and nineteen are in perfect order. The test in each case consisted in filling the drain and man- holes with water. (a) Non-Provided Schools. Name of School. Result of water test of the drainage.

Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to limewashing shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such ceiling or wall is painted, or where the material of or with which that surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where the said surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 16.— Subject to the provisions of these Bye-laws, the landlord of a house let in lodgings shall provide adequate means of ventilation in or in connection with every common passage or staircase in the 121 house let in lodgings, and shall cause the said means of ventilation to be maintained at all times in good order. 17.—Subject to the provisions of these Bye-laws, the landlord of a house let in lodgings shall cause all such means of ventilation as are provided in or in connection with any room in the house let in lodgings to be maintained at all times in good order. 18.— Where, in pursuance of any statutory provision in that behalf, an order of a justice has been obtained for the removal from a house let in lodgings to a hospital of a person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disease and is without proper lodging or accommodation, the landlord of the house let in lodgings, where the landlord resides in any part of the premises and the lodger to whom any room whereof the person aforesaid may be an occupant has been let shall, on being informed of the order, forthwith take all such steps as are requisite on the part of the landlord and of the lodger, respectively, to secure the safe and prompt removal of the said person in compliance with the order, and shall in and about the removal, adopt all such precautions as, in accordance with any instructions which the landlord and the lodger respectively may receive from the Medical Officer of Health of the Council, are most suitable for the circumstances of the case. 19.—Where a duty imposed upon or a prohibition applied to the landlord of a house let in lodgings is by any Bye-law expressly imposed or applied subject to the provisions of these Bye-laws, proceedings shall not be taken against the landlord for an offence against the Bye-law unless and until the landlord, after service upon him of a notice in writing by the Council requiring him within such reasonable time as is specified in the notice to comply with the Bye-lav/ has failed to comply with the Bye-law within the time so specified.

Information was received on January 2nd from the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London that 20,000 bags of coffee and 2,150 bags of cocoa damaged by river water had been removed from the sunken S.S. "Caravellas" which had been in collision with another steamer at a spot in the Thames two miles below Greenwich, and that the coffee and cocoa were to be landed at the West Kent Wharf. Samples of the coffee were taken and roasted, and an infusion made. It was considered that the high temperature of roasting had completely destroyed all sewage contamination, and that the coffee when roasted would be sound and fit for human food. Some portion of this cargo had been landed in Bermondsey, and there seized and samples taken before a Magistrate. It was decided by the Magistrate that the coffee had been rightly seized and was unsound in its raw state, but that it was in a state of being prepared for sale, which state was not completed until after the process of roasting had taken place. The Magistrate further stated that when the coffee was roasted he considered that it would be sound and fit for human food. He therefore refused to condemn it. In the case of the cocoa, which was roasted and prepared, no more objection could be taken to it than with the case of the coffee. A summons had been previously carried out before the Magistrate for its condemnation, but, after the decision in the Bermondsey seizure, it was withdrawn and the cocoa allowed to be removed for sale. At market the cocoa and coffee fetched very nearly the usual prices paid for such articles. 140 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT.
