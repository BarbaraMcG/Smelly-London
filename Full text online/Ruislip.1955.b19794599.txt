I would like therefore to place on record my appreciation of the work of the Chief Sanitary Inspector and the other members of the Department, The vital statistics for the District are set out in the body of the report in the usual manner. The mid-year population for 1955 was very slightly up on the previous year and now stands at 72,700 and it is estimated that there were 21,332 inhabited dwellings. The principal figures call for little comment - the corrected birth rate of 13 02 and the corrected death rate of 9 4 compare with the national rates of 15 and 11.7 respectively. The infant mortality rate for the District of 22.83 shews a very slight increase over the figure for 1954 but is still lower than the national rate of 24.9 In this connection it should be remembered that comparatively small numbers are being dealt with; consequently considerable variation in the infantile death rate can be brought about by quite small changes in the number of deaths. These deaths of infants under one year are a challenge to preventive medicine, but as time goes on it is found that more and more of them are 2 due to conditions about which we know very little and about which a great deal of research is still necessary I have included a table shewing the causes of the infant deaths which took place during the year In connection with infectious disease, the main feature was the great increase in the number of measles cases. This disease is epidemic in roughly biennial cycles and 1955 was a peak year - in 1954 there were 27 cases and in 1953 there were 1051 cases. Whooping cough notifications were more numerous than in the previous year while those for scarlet fever were lower. There was no death from any of these infectious diseases. Once again there was no case of diphtheria notified It has now been absent so long that it has ceased to be a public health problem in the sense of being dangerous to a large number of persons every year. However, it must be remembered that the infection is still with us in this country and any slackening of its control could lead to a very serious outbreak. The control of diphtheria depends on the immunisation of infants and the boosting of the immunity as produced by an additional injection during childhood. As cases of diphtheria and the resultant family tragedies disappear into the past, it is becoming more and more difficult to persuade parents of the paramount necessity of having their children immunised - especially as it is to protect them against something of which the general public have no experience. As time goes on the techniques of the protective immunisations are being steadily improved and it is now the general practice to combine with the diphtheria immunisation, substances which give some protection also against whooping cough and tetanus. In recent months a vaccine has been introduced which gives some protection against poliomyelitis. If this proves to be as successful as it is hoped, it may be that poliomyelitis will be controlled in the same way as is diphtheria. Looking further ahead it may be that in the future it will be possible to combine these various innoculations and to give an infant a single course of injections which will protect it against these more dangerous infectious diseases. Another perennial problem is that of smallpox. Although there was no case of this disease in the District during 1955, I make no apology for referring to this matter year after year. Not enough infants are being vaccinated to give the necessary immunity against this disease. Living as we do adjacent to a major airport, it is only a matter of time before a case of smallpox will be introduced into the District. When that happens secondary cases are bound to occur - if they occur in unvaccinated individuals the results will be tragic, as experience in other districts in recent years has shewn only too clearly. Primary vaccination in the infant is comparatively safe and gives a protection against the disease which only slowly wanes over the years. It has this very great advantage, however, that it makes subsequent vaccinations - whether necessary because of contact with the disease, or because of 3 the requirements of foreign travel or service in the Forces a comparatively trivial procedure. Primary vaccination in an adult can however, be a most disturbing experience I wish therefore, once again to make a plea for much more attention to be paid to this need for infant vaccination The work in connection with food hygiene has now reached the stage when it has become part of the routine work of a Public Health Department and it is no longer regarded as a special activity. The traders concerned with food handling have co-operated willingly with the department and are becoming more and more aware of the hygiene standards required The new Food and Drugs Regulations also will be the means of making a further advance in the standards regarded as generally acceptable. Two other activities of the Public Health Department should be mentioned In connection with the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 a number of inspections were made and, the necessary action taken Inspections were also made under the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 It is gratifying to be able to report that appliances now on sale comply with the conditions set out under the regulations made under this Act Unfortunately, however, there are many thousands of old appliances still in use which do not reach the specified standards the department has no power to deal with these and it is the responsibility of householders to see that the heating appliances they use are properly safeguarded I would like to thank the members of the Public Health Committee for their great help and encouragement shewn to the department during the year My thanks are especially due to the Chairman of the Committee who has at all times been most interested in the work of the department and has given most valuable assistance in the solution of a number of rather difficult problems. I am, Yours obedient Servant, O. C, DOBSON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 2,088 acres Eastcote Ward 1,231 acres Ruislip Ward 1,757 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,507 acres 6,583 acres POPULATION The Registrar General's estimate of the population for the mid-year:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 69,640 71,220 72,130 72,070 72,700 Population Census 1951 68,288 Estimated Number of Inhabited Dwellings 21,332 BIRTH RATE NO.
