FR1 12 Friern Barnet Urban District Council REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, FOR THE YEAR 1915, BY FRANK A. SPREAT, F R.C S .Eng., D.P H., R.C.PS. Member of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health medical officer of health. London: Roberts & Newton, Printers Tottenham Lane, Crouch End N 1916. to the CHAIRMAN and MEMBERS of the Friern Barnet Urban District Council. March 14th, 1916. Gentlemen, In presenting my Report for the year 1915, I have, with a view to reducing the expense of printing, limited myself strictly to the tables of statistics, and a few brief comments upon them. Owing to the extensive migration throughout the country, and the consequent depletion of the male population under 40 years of age, on account of the war, it is impossible to give a correct estimate of the population in many districts. The district of Friern Barnet, however, has not been affected by munition work, nor the billeting of troopa|, building works have been practically suspended, and there are somewhat fewer unoccupied houses. I have, therefore, for the purpose of estimating the population, adhered to the method of obtaining data from the rate books. With a view to assisting local Medical Officers of Health, the Registrar-General has prepared an estimate of the population for every local administrative district, based on information supplied by the National Register of August, 1915. This figure for Friern Barnet is given as 13,238, the Census of 1911 gave us 12,201, a difference of 1,037 for a period of four years. 2 Knowing that building operations were particularly extensive in the years 1912 and 1913, and that the rate books show that these houses were quickly occupied, it is obvious that the Registrar-General's figure is too low for the purpose of calculating our rates in 1915. The method used by the Registrar-General was to take the ratio of the total population less the males (aged 15-65) to the number of females (aged 15-65) in 1911. and to apply this factor to the number of females (aged 15-65) on the National Register of 1915, the resulting product, plus the males (aged 15-65) on the National Register, was assumed to be the civil population for 1915. There is no guarantee that the National Register has fully enumerated the population (aged 15-65) and further, the Registrar-General has assumed that the ratio between the females (aged 15-65) to the number of children below 15 years of age, in 1911, is the same in 1915. By following my usual method, my estimate will be too high by the number of male absentees, and these numbered in the middle of 1915 approximately 500. North. South. Central. Total.

These numbered 325, 126 in the district and 199 in the Asylum; 205 were transferred away from the district, leaving a nett number belonging to the district of 120. The nett death-rate based on my estimate of the population is 10.1, allowing for absentees, this is increased to 10.4, and using the Registrar's estimated population, it becomes 12.0. Infantile Deaths. The deaths under 1 year numbered 34, giving a death-rate of 105 per 1,000 births; this is somewhat 3 higher than usual, and is to be attributed to the large decrease in the number of births, and to an increase in the number of deaths due to congenital defects. Births. These numbered 323, against 403 in 1914, giving a birth-rate of 20.6 (on an estimated population of 15,735), increased to 21.0 when allowing for absentees; this rate is further increased to 24.4 if the Registrar-General's estimate of 13,238 is used. The illegitimate births numbered 8, an increase of 7.6 above the average for the last five years. Infectious Diseases. These numbered 96 against 105 for 1914. There was a marked decrease in Scarlet Fever, but this was counterbalanced by an increase in Diphtheria. In concluding this Repprt, I wish to thank Mr. Albert Harman, the Sanitary Inspector, for his assistance in the preparation of the Statistics, and have pleasurle in expressing to the Members of the Council my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and assistance during the past year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. A. Spreat, Medical Officer of Health. 4 table 1. Vital Statistics of Whole district during 1915 and Previous Years. Name of District—FRIERN BARNET. Year.

The rates should be calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population, as stated in Col. 2, without the use of the standardising factor for the district given in the Annual Report of the Registrar General. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a net population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of Inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. * In Column 6 are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the calendar year as having actually occurred within the district, but excluding the deaths of Soldiers and Sailors that have occured in hospitals and institutions in the district. Information as to the number and causes of such deaths should, however, be given in the text of the report. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6, corrected 5 by subtrattion of this number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in f-he number given in Column 9. + The Medical Officer of Health will be able from the returns made to him by the local Registrar of Deaths, as well as from the quarterly lists furnished by the Registrar-General, to fill in Column 8 in accordance with the rule in the next paragraph below. The RegistrarGeneral, either directly or through the County Medical Officer of Health, will supply the Medical Officer of Health with the particulars of deaths to be entered in Column 9; and all such deaths must be included in this Column, unless an error is detected, and its correction has been accepted by the Registrar-General. For Column 4 the Registrar-General will furnish, about the end of January, to the Medical Officer of Health a Statement of the number of births needing to be added to or substracted from the total supplied by the ocal Registrar. ‡ "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, e.g., casuals, must not be included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (6) below. The Medical Officer of Health will state in Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of " non-residents " which are to be deducted, and will state in Column 9 the number of deaths of " residents " registered outside the district which are to be added in calculating the nett death-rate of his district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (6) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, it known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, it known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.
