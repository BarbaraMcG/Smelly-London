LICENTIATE OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, ED., ETC. HONORARY SECRETARY OF THE BRITISH METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY. AUTHOR OF NUMEROUS ESSAYS RELATIVE TO VITAL STATISTICS, AND ON MEDICAL METEOROLOGY. Printed by Order of the Board. London; ANDREW T. ROBERTS, PRINTER, 5, HACKNEY ROAD, 1866. SANITARY REPORT For the Year 1865. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, One of the most interesting subjects to which I shall have to refer in my report for this year is the Rinderpest, or Cattle Plague. There can be now but little doubt that the disease was brought from the Continent to London, and spread from thence over the country; but there is no proof whatever as to the mode in which it was imported, or the country from which it came. The earliest known case occurred at Lambeth, on the 24th of June; the next at Islington, on the 27th ; and the third at Hackney, on the 28th of June. Soon after this the disease appeared in a large proportion of the Hackney cow-sheds, and has raged with more or less intensity up to the present time. I was unable in many instances to ascertain the mode of propagation, but in the largest proportion was satisfied that the disease was brought to the sheds by cattle bought in the market. There can also be little doubt that the disease was spread over the country to a great extent by the cows being sent from infected London dairies to the markets for sale. The Orders in Council assisted most materially in disseminating the disease, for it was the interest of the cowkeepers to prevent the Government Inspector from visiting the 4 sheds, as the cows were ordered to be slaughtered without compensation, or the animals were kept in the infected sheds. One result of the Orders was, that the owner, on the outbreak of the disease, frequently sent his stock to market, and as the period of incubation was nine days, often with the disease in the blood, although the animal was apparently healthy. If compensation had been given early in the epidemic for cattle killed by order of an Inspector, and if every animal had been promptly destroyed as soon as the earliest symptoms appeared, there can be but little doubt that the disease would not have spread over England as it has done. The course which the disease has taken is however that which epidemic diseases usually pursue. The early cases occurred here and there, and were nearly all fatal. The disease then assumed a decidedly epidemic form, causing an increased number of deaths every week, until its highest point was attained, and then gradually diminished in intensity and frequency. The mortality has almost precisely corresponded with a curve calculated by Dr. Farr, from the deaths during the early period of the epidemic, so that we have every reason to believe that the deaths will be reduced to a small number after June next. It is however a question if we shall entirely get rid of the disease for some time. The sanitary effects of the cattle-plague may be considered chiefly under the following heads, viz., the influence on the health of the people by the greater or less use of diseased meat; by the use of diseased milk; and by the increased price of meat. As regards the first points, I do not think that any appreciable injury to health has been sustained by the use of diseased flesh or milk, because joints taken from animals slightly affected have been eaten, after being well cooked, without disagreeing with those who partook of them; and because 5 no cases were observed which could be attributed to the eating of diseased meat. The use of diseased milk could not under any circumstances be great as the secretion of milk was immediately diminished and often ceased on the development of the disease. There can however be but little doubt that milk from affected animals was sold, and has caused diarrhoea. The continuous high price of meat is however a far more serious matter, as English people, and especially children, require a fair amount of meat, otherwise they become ancemic and inclined to consumption or other diseases of debility. The mortality in the Hackney District was rather in excess during last year, but not to so great an extent as in the whole of London. The number of deaths was smaller in 1865, after allowing for increased population than in 1864, 2187 deaths having been registered in 1865, against the corrected number of 2228 for 1864. By the "corrected number" I mean the number which would have died in 1864 if the population had been as numerous as in 1865. The rate of births was also more favorable, being 155 to each 100 deaths in 1865, against 148 to each 100 deaths in 1864. TABLE 1. 1865.—Births in each Sub-District. Quarters.

In 1860 the number was 2633; in 1861, 2752; in 1862, 2768; in 1863, 3075; in 1864, 3170; and in 1865, 3356, or an increase of nearly 700 since 1860. The table also shows that 190 births were registered in Stoke Newington sub-district, being at the rate of 57 in each 1000 births for the whole District. There were 167 or 50 per 1000 in Stamford Hill sub-district; 772 or 230 per 1000 in West Hackney; 1368 or 407 per 1000 in Hackney; 8.59 or 256 in South Hackney. As compared with the residents in 1861, we find that the birth rate was less than the per centage of population in Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, and West Hackney, but was greater in Hackney and South Hackney. The ratio between the births and population of the sub-districts has altered so greatly since 1861 as to show that the relative number of residents has also enormously altered by increase in Hackney and South Hackney.

Now although the per centage has declined in Stoke Newington, and Stamford Hill since 1857, yet the absolute numbar of births is greater in both. In 1857 there were 167 births in Stoke Newington to 190 in 1865; 153 in Stamford Hill to 167 in 1865. But in West Hackney the births were absolutely less, having been 780 in 1861 and 772 in 1865. The per centage of births decreased most in West Hackney, having been 32.2 in 1857 and only 23.0 in 1865. TABLE III. 1865.—Deaths in each Sub-District. Quarters Stoke Newington Stamford Hill.

This number 1033 in Hackney includes the deaths in the East London Union, German Hospital, and Union Workhouse. I have hitherto deducted the deaths in the Union and spread them over the other Districts pro rata to the population, but do not propose doing so for the future as the residents in Hackney and South Hackney have increased out of all proportion to the other 8 sub-districts. The per centages, therefore, in the next line represent the mortality, less the deaths in the East London Union and German Hospital. The per centages of deaths as compared with the total mortality are as follows : 6.0 per cent. in Stoke Newington, 5.3 per cent. in Stamford Hill, 24.0 per cent. in West Hackney, 41.1 per cent. in Hackney, and 23.6 per cent. in South Hackney. If we now turn to the table at the end of the Report, we can ascertain the cause of, and age at, death of each person registered during the year; and I shall first point out the totals of the various groups. In the first group are included all epidemic diseases. To prevent misunderstanding I will mention that the term "zymotic or epidemic" diseases is used in the Registrar General's classification to signify diseases which can be propagated by contagion or infection, or which are supposed to arise from some fermentative action in the blood. I must say that I do not think many of the diseases included in this group should be placed there. The next group includes gout, cancer, dropsy, and mortification, and shows a mortality of 77. Tubercular diseases caused 397 deaths, brain diseases 261, heart affections 107, lung diseases 351, affections of the abdominal organs 81, premature birth and debility 73, old age 167, and atrophy 46. There were also 70 deaths from accidents and suicide, and 3 from murder and manslaughter. The next table shows the per centages which these classes of deaths bear to each other during 9 years. From this we see that epidemic diseases have been proportionably less fatal in 1865 than in 1858, 1859, 1862, and 1863. This is very satisfactory considering the outbreak of Fever at the Orphan Asylum. TABLE IV. Per Centages of Deaths in 1857-65—From All Diseases.

The rate of tubercular affections, 18.1 is also higher than it has been since 1857, but it, as well as the Zymotic is not so high as in most districts. Deaths from diseases of the nervous system were fewer than usual, the proportion being 11.9 per cent. Diseases of the heart were less fatal than usual. Affections of the lungs also caused fewer deaths, the average of the nine years being 16 3 per cent., and that for 1865 16.1 per cent. The other classes do not require any special mention, except "from old age," under which head we find a larger proportion than usual. 10 TABLE V. 1856-65—Deaths from Seven Epidemic Diseases. 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 49°0 51°0 49°2 50°7 47°0 49°4 49°5 50°3 48° 5 Small.Pox 13 1 0 5 2 1 2 41 12 6 Measles 39 22 36 10 43 36 32 37 79 22 Scarlet Fever 51 41 76 82 64 58 83 125 64 98 Diphtheria – — 27 27 11 24 27 34 15 22 Whooping Cough 29 57 64 36 51 62 56 28 48 56 Diarrhœa 65 69 50 87 19 55 25 60 71 125 Fever 62 59 51 55 38 55 89 49 77 75 Total 259 249 304 302 228 291 314 374 366 404 The above table shows the number of deaths which have been registered from the seven most fatal epidemic diseases, viz: small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, diarrhoea and fever. The mortality from small-pox was less than the average, having been only 6, or less than 1 in each 3,500 deaths. Measles also caused an unusually small mortality, viz: 22, whilst scarlet fever was very fatal, 98 deaths having been registered from this cause. The deaths from diphtheria were below an average, viz: 22; whilst whooping cough was slightly above it, viz: 56, against an average of 53. Diarrhoea was unusually fatal, having caused a mortality of 125, against 71 in 1864; whilst fever was less fatal than in 1864, having caused a mortality of 75 against a corrected number of 80. The rate of deaths from fever was rather more than 1 in 30 from all causes, which is by no means a large average. The deaths registered from cholera were comparatively unimportant 5 out of the 7 deaths having occurred in children under 5 years of age, I made enquiry in these cases, and came to the conclusion that not one was true cholera but only severe diarrhoea with great prostration. Cases of this kind are more or less 11 prevalent during the hot weather. These numbers are uncorrected for increase of population, so that 4 per cent. should be added for each year, i.e., 36 per cent. for 1856, 32 per cent. for 1857, to render the comparison correct.

Hitherto the mortality of children under 1 year old has been unusually small, but we must expect a larger rate for the future as there have been a very great number of small houses erected in the District, and it is well known that the rate of death in infants is much higher amongst the poorer than the wealthier classes. But this is not the only reason for the unusually large proportion of deaths in infants during last year, as an examination of the table at the end of the report shows an immense increase in the deaths of infants from diarrhoea. This is a warning that the greatest care must be exercised in removing all causes which may induce diarrhoea, in remedying any sanitary defects which may exist, and in carefully selecting proper food for children. How far bad milk may have assisted in causing this increased mortality I cannot say, but I did not discover any adulterations except water and salt in any of the specimens of milk which I examined during last year. The mortality between 1 and 5 years of age was less in 18C5 than in 1864, so that the total under 5 varied very little, the rate in 1864 having been 38.7, and in 1865 39.1 percent. A comparison of the deaths under 5 years of age from diarrhoea and scarlet fever entirely account for the excess of deaths in children during 1865. The great excess of deaths from fever in 1865 between five and fifteen years of age is very striking, but arises chiefly from the outbreak at the Orphan Asylum, and the prevalence of Typhoid instead of any other form of fever. The deaths from fever above fifteen years of age were fewer than usual. The variations in the mortuary rate at the other ages are scarcely worth notice, except that an unusually large proportion died in 1865 between 75 and 85 years of age as compared with 1864. There were no less than 236 deaths of 13 persons above 75 years of age, or at the rate of 108 in each 1000 deaths. The average rate of death for the whole of London was 243 in each 10,000; in 1864 it was 246 in each 10,000. The rate of death for the whole of the Northern Metropolitan Districts was as nearly as possible the same in 1865, viz: 245 per 10,000 residents. These numbers of course are calculated on a population corrected at the same rate of increase as occurred during the years 1851-61. I think this is too high for the Northern Districts generally as it was 2.34 per cent. per annum. The population of Hackney increased during the same time at the rate of 4 per cent, but I believe has increased more rapidly since 1861. The deaths in the Hackney District in 1865 were 2187, of which however 227 occurred in the East London Union and German Hospital. Deducting the 227 there remains 1960 deaths belonging to Hackney. Assuming the population in the middle of 1865 to have been 94,369 and the number of deaths 1960, the rate of death would be 10 in each 482 living or 207 in each 10,000 residents. If to this we add the proportion of deaths in the Metropolitan Hospital we obtain the corrected number of 218 deaths in each 10,000 living, against 245 for all the Northern Districts. This shows that Hackney has, as usual, been much more healthy than London at large or than the adjoining Districts. The temperature for the year was unusually high having been 50°3 or nearly 1° above the average of 24 years. The temperature of January, February, March, and August was below the mean, and of all the other months above it. The highest temperature recorded at the Town Hall was 83½ degrees and the lowest 16½ degrees, showing a range of 67 degrees. The extreme cold of the early part of the year, and the 14 great heat of summer and autumn must have produced a higher rate of mortality than would otherwise have obtained. The number of nuisances removed by Mr. Valentine was larger than usual, and required a great amount of labour and time. As new houses are built the distance to be walked over in removing the nuisances also increases, whilst from their nature (choked drains instead of filthy cesspools) they require more immediate attention and removal. In addition to the 1512 nuisances abated, there have been inspections of cow sheds and slaughter houses, examinations of houses in which no nuisances were discovered, and other work of which no record is kept. The nuisances are as usual classed under 9 heads as follows : Privies emptied, filled up, and drained into the sewer 213 Privies and Cesspools emptied 9 Stable, Pig, Cow-dung, and other refuso removed 261 Premises repaired and limewashed 252 Gullies trapped, Roads cleansed, &c. 37 Pigs removed, and Pigsties repaired and cleansed 56 Choked Drains cleansed, repaired, and re-constructed 433 Urinals, and other filthy and offensive places cleansed 41 Other nuisances 210 Total 1512 The plan of requiring the attendance before the Board of all persons whom it is proposed to summons before a Magistrate is as successful as ever, and saves much expense and trouble to those who neglect the preliminary notices. I have also to report that during 1865, I have inspected the following localities, chiefly in company with Mr. Valentine. 15 No. of Street or Road. Houses.

This shows that two or more inspections were made of different houses in the same street at different times of the year. Mr. Valentine served notices on premises in a much larger number of streets than are mentioned here, as I do not inspect any but places where epidemic diseases have prevailed, or periodically in the poorer streets, or previously to owners of property being summoned before the Board.
