PUBLIC URINALS. The number of Urinals in the District is now 23. In consequence of numerous complaints made to the Board as to the need of Urinal accommodation in the neighbourhood of Parnham Street, Limehouse, the matter was referred to the Works Committee, who recommended the Board to put up a Urinal in Blount Street, at the corner of Parnham Street. The recommendation was approved by the Board, and the works have been carried out by the Contractor in accordance with the Plan and Estimate. One of the screens of the Urinal in West Gardens, Shadwell has been repaired. A brick dummy has been built in the angle of the Railway Arch in St. Paul's Road, and posts and chains fixed in order to prevent nuisances being committed. CLEANSING AND WATERING. The principal Streets throughout the District, including footways, are cleansed daily, and the others every second day, except in bad weather when the whole are cleansed each day, and the Commercial Road and the East and West India Dock Roads twice a day if necessary. During the season the streets have been watered by the Contractors with water supplied by the East London Water Works Company—the quantity of water used being 6,051,000 gallons for the season 1884. The Courts and Alleys throughout the District have been Hushed with water during the hot dry weather. GENERAL WORKS. A street rest has been formed in the East India Dock Road, opposite the Eastern Hotel, for the convenience of the foot traffic at that point and to prevent accidents, and a lamp with a 10 feet burner has been fixed to the post in the centre. The Courts and Alleys throughout the District have been lime-whited. The Postal Authorities have laid a telegraph wire from Commercial Road along Stepney Causeway, Brook Street, and Collingwood Street to Free Trade Wharf. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company have substituted steel rails for the original iron rails in parts of the Commercial Road, and have also relaid parts of the paving.

The Medical Officer of Health having made an Official Representation to the Metropolitan Board of Works as to an unhealthy area at Shadwell, bounded on the North by houses in Cable Street, on the South by houses in High Street, on the East by Albert Street, and on the West by Victoria Street, a Committee of the Metropolitan Board inspected the area, and that Board resolved not to prepare an Improvement Scheme for dealing therewith. Subsequently, the Home Secretary (Sir W. V. Harcourt) was furnished, by request, with a report by the Medical Officer as to the course adopted by the Metropolitan Board, and Sir Charles Dilke (President of the Local Government Board) having inspected the area comprised in the Official Representation, the Home Secretary has directed Mr. I). Cubitt Nichols to hold a Local Inquiry, pursuant to Section 8 of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, into the correctness of the Official Representation and with a view to the making a Scheme for the improvement of the area. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. In consequence of numerous complaints of the effluvia from the Sewers in the District, the Board made a Regulation that all new drains, and all old drains re-constructed, should be ventilated by means of a pipe carried up a sufficient height above the highest part of tho building, to prevent noxious gases entering the chimneys or windows of such building, or any building adjacent thereto. THE METROPOLIS MANAGEMENT (THAMES RIVER PREVENTION OF FLOODS) AMENDMENT ACT, 1879. The Metropolitan Board of Works served an order upon the Board to construct certain works to prevent flooding in the public passage leading from Church Row, Limehouse, to the Limehouse Cut. The required works have been carried out. NORTH METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS. The Company obtained Parliamentary powers for the construction of Tramways in the West India Dock Road, commencing by junctions with the existing Tramways of the Company at, or near, the South end of Burdett Road, passing thence into and along and terminating in the West India Dock Road, near the crossing thereof by the London and Black wall Railway. The Company by agreement, inserted in the Act the necessary clauses for tho protection of the Limehouse District, and for the purchase of the paving to be interfered with by the construction of the Tramways. The works authorised by the Aet have been carried out by tho Company, and the Tramways have been opened for trattie. f SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON-PARK STREET SITE. The attention of the Board was called to the fact that the London School Board had resolved to appropriate a site in Park Street, Limehouse, for School purposes, and the Board, upon the Report of a Committee, requested the School Board to reconsider their determination, and suggested that a site adjoining, in Gill Street, would be more suitable. A Deputation from the Board was received by a Committee of the School Board, and the views of the Board were explained in detail. The result was that the Committee intimated that there were objections to the removal of the site, and I subsequently had several interviews with the Surveyor of the School Board, and urged that the Gill Street Site should be brought under the consideration of the Committee, as I considered it would cost less money and be more convenient and eligible for the purpose required. No decision has yet been come to upon the subject. THAMES COMMUNICATIONS —NIGHTINGALE LANE SCHEME. The Hackney District Board and the Vestry of Bethnal Green having taken the opinion of Counsel as to the legality of their contributing towards the opposition to the Nightingale Lane Tunnel Scheme of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in Parliament, this Board determined to oppose the same in conjunction with the Poplar District Board, at a cost to each Hoard not exceeding £500. Counsel were thereupon instructed to oppose the Metropolitan Board's Bill before the Committee of the House of Commons, and witnesses were engaged to give evidence against the Bill. Ultimately the Parliamentary Committee decided that the preamble of the Bill was not proved, and the scheme was therefore not proceeded with. TOWER (DUPLEX) BRIDGE BILL. The Works Committee, to whom the question of the scheme proposed by this Bill to be carried out had been referred recommended the Board not to take any steps with reference thereto, and the Board adopted such recommendation. THAMES COMMUNICATIONS—SHADWELL TUNNEL SCHEME. In reply to the communications which had been made by the Board to the Metropolitan Board of Works, a letter was received dated 22nd November, 1884, from that Board, with reference to the opinion expressed in the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons that a Subway should be constructed by the Metropolitan Board of works at, or near, Shadwell, and enumerating certain reasons against the formation of such Tunnel, and stating that that Board felt it would be premature to proceed with an application to Parliament for a permanent crossing at Shadwell that Session, but had determined at once to apply for powers to establish two free ferries for the accommodation of the traffic at points lower down the river, one between Poplar and Greenwich, and the other between North and South Woolwich. A Committee having been formed at a public meeting at Limehouse for the purpose of urging the formation of a Tunnel at Shadwell, Delegates were appointed by the Board to co-operate therewith. The Board also presented a Memorial to the Home Secretary upon the subject, and several Members of the Board attended with a Deputation from the Limehouse Thames Crossings Committee to the Home Secretary, in support thereof. LONDON RIVERSIDE FISH MARKET. An influential Board of Directors has been formed, the Land for the Market purchased, and the construction of the Market commenced. LONDON AND BLACKBALL RAILWAY COMPANY. Plans, Sections, Book of Reference, and Notice of Application to Parliament for powers to carry out the following works were deposited, viz:—To empower the Company to widen the existing railway from Stepney Station to the Western boundary of the District. The matter was referred to the Works Committee, who, after consideration, recommended that a petition should he presented against the Bill, in order to procure the insertion of the necessary clause for the protection of the District. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. With 5787 BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for the year 1884. Withnw 5787 TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the Health and Sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1884. The deaths in the District during that year exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the District, but inclusive of those residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated beyond the limits of the District, amounted to 1,369, which number indicates a death rate for the year of 23.3 per 1,000. 2 The Metropolitan death rate for the same period was 20.3 per 1,000. The Births numbered 2,202 which indicates a Birth rate for the year of 37 per 1,000 population. The Metropolitan Birth rate for the same period was 33.7 per 1,000. The deaths of children under one year amounted to 22.4 per cent. of the total deaths or 2.8 per cent. less than the average of the last ten years. The percentage of deaths of children under one year to registered Births was 13.9 or 2.5 per cent. less than the average of the last ten years. The deaths of children under five years of age amounted to 42.5 per cent. of the total deaths or 3.9 per cent. less than the average of the last ten years. The Birth rate coincided almost with the average, while the death rate was 1.4 per 1,000 population below it. The Seven principal Zymotic Diseases caused a mortality of 238 a number equivalent to 4 per 1,000 of population. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis) caused 271 deaths which indicates a death rate of 4.6 per 1,000. Tubercular Diseases such as Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets and Tabes destroyed 149 lives and gave a death rate of 2.5 per 1,000. Wasting Diseases of Infants such as Marasmus, Atrophy and Debility caused 125 deaths a number which indicates a death rate of 2.1 per 1,000 population. The Convulsive Diseases of Infants, such as Hydrocephalus, Infantile Meningitis, Convulsions and Teething caused 104 deaths which corresponds to a death rate of 1.7 per 1,000. 3 Small Pox.—Twenty nine deaths occurred from this disease, of which number 25 occurred in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. During the year 174 cases came to my knowledge. Measles.—Seven deaths only were registered from Measles; the Annual average of the last ten years having been 41. Scarlet Fever caused 74 deaths of which number 13 occurred in Hospital. The Annual average for the last ten years was 58 deaths. Diphtheria.—Four deaths occurred from diphtheria; the annual average for the last ten years having been 7. Whooping Cough.—Fifty-two deaths were registered from this disease, a number slightly below the decennial average. Fever caused 18 deaths. Thirty cases were reported to me, of which number, 29 were Enteric and 1 Typhus. Diarrhœa caused 53 deaths, a number slightly below the average of the last ten years. Sanitary Work, &c. For a detached account of the routine Sanitary Work performed during the year, see Table VI. The powers of the Board under the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866, were the subject of discussion early in the year. So far back as 1867 the Board had made Regulations under the Act regarding Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by more than one family, but inasmuch as the principal matters referred to in the Regulations were already the subject of the attention of the Sanitary Staff it had not been deemed necessary to put them into force. The condition of the District has however altered much of late years. Many houses that at the time of the framing of the Regulations were occupied by one family have been let out in tenements and your Board was of opinion that the time had arrived at which it had become desirable to put the Regulations in force in their entirety, and arrangements 4 were made to give effect to this decision. The result has been that up to the end of the year 304 houses have been registered under the provisions of the said Act The localities where the Regulations have been put in force arc Gloucester Street, Gloucester Court, Church Row, Timbury Place, Cross Street, Jamaica Passage, Lock Side, Rich Street, Carr Street, St. Ann Street, Ropemakers Fields, Gill Street, Victoria Place, Chapel Place, Fortunate Place, Angel Court, London Street, Medland Street, Brook Street, and Red Lion Street. The Sanitary control of the Bakehouses having reverted to your Board under the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, Regulations, of which the following is a copy, were issued by your Board to the Bakers in the District with an intimation that such Regulations were to be placed in a prominent position on the premises and observed. REGULATIONS AS TO BAKEHOUSES, Made pursuant to the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883; 46 & 47 Vic., c. 53. 1. Every Bakehouse shall be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, water-closet, or other nuisance The floors shall be carefully swept at least once every 24 hours, and the sweepings shall be immediately placed in an impermeable covered receptacle, and removed From the bakehouse at not longer intervals than every seven days. 2.

The owner or occupier of a Bakehouse shall give immediate notice to the Medical Officer of Health of any case of infectious disease occurring on the same premises as the Bakehouse. PENALTIES. Every Bakehouse in which there is a contravention of Sections 3, 33 and 34 of the Factory and Workshop Act. 1878, which provide for the sanitary condition and cleansing of the Bakehouse, shall be deemed not to be kept in conformity with the Act, and the occupier thereof is liable for default to a fine not exceeding Ten Pounds.

An infringement of the loth Section of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, which prohibits— A direct communication between a water-closet, earth-closet, privy, or ash-pit, with the Bakehouse; The supply of water to a Bakehouse from a cistern also supplying a water-closet; 6 Regulations as to Bakehouses (Continued). The opening into a Bakehouse of a drain carrying off focal or sewage matter; is punishable by a fine not exceeding Forty Shillings, and a further fine not exceeding Five Shillings for every day during which the infringement is continued after a conviction, T. W. RATCLIFF, April, 1884. Clerk. The Bakehouses are now regularly inspected three times a year. The Animal Charcoal Works in New Gravel Lane, Shadwell, were frequently the subject of complaint on the part of persons residing in the locality. The works have been established some years, but for a considerable time no charcoal had been made there, the operations consisting almost entirely in re-burning charcoal that had been used in the purification and decolorization of sugar. A few months back, however, the Company resolved to char bones on their premises, and with this view, retorts, similar to those in use in gas works were put up, and the operations which then ensued resembled those of such works with tho substitution of bones for coal. The charring of bones gives rise, however, to much more offensive products than the charring of coal, and as soon as the process was started the whole neighbourhood became unpleasantly aware of the fact. The process earned on at these works is as follows:—The bones to be charred are placed in heated retorts which are then closed and luted ; the products evolved are permanently gaseous, mixed with condensable vapours—the first are used on the premises and the second which are highly charged with Ammonia arc converted into Sulphate of Ammonia. The greatest care is required in dealing with these products to prevent offensive smells arising. The resulting bone charcoal is raked out of the retorts and cooled, a procedure accompanied by the evolution of steam and Sulphuretted Hydrogen. Up to the present time I cannot congratulate the Company on the success of their endeavours to mitigate the nuisance caused by their operations. In July, a Committee of the Metropolitan Board inspected the insanitary area in Shadwell, referred to in my last Annual Report, as having been the subject of a Representation to that body, under the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Acts, 1875. On July 21st the Committee drew up a Report to the effect that the area was not a 7 case for the application of the Artisans Ac. Dwellings Act, and on the 25th July at a meeting of the Board a resolution was passed in accordance with this opinion. On 7th August a letter was addressed to your Clerk, by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, requesting him to move your Board to obtain from me a report on the action of the Metroplitan Board, and on the 22nd October I made 6uch Report of which the following is a copy. To the BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. “Gentlemen, "In compliance with the Resolution passed by the Board on 24th ult. I beg to submit my Report on the course taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works, with reference to an Official Representation under the provisions of the Artisans and labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, made by me on 3rd October 1883, regarding an unhealthy area in Shadwell. "The area in question is bounded on the North by houses in Cable Street, on the South by houses in High Street, on the East by Albert Street, and on the West by Victoria Street; and is occupied by labourers, their wives and families, street hawkers, sailors, and prostitutes. It includes some of the worst Courts and places in the District. The approaches to it from Albert Street, High Street, and Cable Street are beneath the first floors of the houses flanking the entrances. Many of the houses have no spaces in the rear, and some of them are built back to back; the w. c. accommodation is in many instances unsatisfactory, but it is the best that can be had under existing circumstances. The ground floors of a large number of the houses are below the level of the pathway; and a considerable number of the houses were built from 150 to 200 years ago and are now, structurally, in a bad condition. The Courts and places are narrow and the whole area is considerably below the level of the adjacent Streets, thus conducing to a condition of dampness with its attendant evils. "The Death rate of the area for the three years, 1880, 1881 and 1882, averaged 44 per 1,000 per annum, while the death rate of the District for the same period was but 25 per 1,000. "Prominent among the causes of death I find diseases of a tubercular character, and you will gain some idea of the mortality from these diseases, when I tell you that in the three years mentioned above, the Death rate in the area from these causes was at the rate of 9 per 1,000 population per annum, while in the District it was at the rate of 2.6 per 1,000, and further, that in the same three years, the proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths from these causes in the District was at the rate of 107 per annum, while in the area it was at the rate of 218, that is to say, that of every 1,000 deaths in the District 107 were due to tubercular diseases, while in the area 218 were due to such causes. "Knowing the locality well and its defects and requirements, and being in possession of these facts, I made my Representation, being fully persuaded that nothing but a re-construction of the area would, or could, deal effectually with such a condition of things. "The following is a copy of the Representation:— 8 October 3rd, 1883. To the METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS "Gentlemen, "I hereby make an Official Representation to your Honourable Board "under the provisions of the Artisans and labourers Dwellings Improvement "Acts, 1875-82 regarding an area in this District. "The area in question is situated in the Parish of Shad well, and is "bounded on the north by the houses in Cable Street, on the west by Victoria "Street, on the south by premises in High Street, Shadwell, and on the east "by Albert Street, and is shown in the accompanying plan tinted red. "I am of opinion that the Houses Courts and Alleys within this area "under the jurisdiction of your Honourable Board arc unlit for human "habitation, and I have found upon investigation that diseases indicating a "generally low condition of health amongst the population have been from "time to time prevalent therein. I hold the opinion that such prevalence may "reasonably be attributed to the closeness, narrowness bad arrangement and "bad condition of the streets and houses, and groups of houses, within the area, "as well as to the want of light, air, ventilation and proper conveniences, and "I am further of opinion that the evils connected with such houses, courts, or "alleys and the sanitary defects in the area cannot be effectually remedied "otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and "re-Construction of the streets and houses within the area. "I have the honour, "Gentlemen, "To remain your most obedient Servant, "G. A. ROGERS, " Medical Officer of Health for " the Limehouse District." "This letter was acknowledged in due course. "On Saturday, the 19th July last, the area was viewed by certain Members of the Works Committee of the Metropolitan Board, and on Monday, 21st July, the following Report was made by them. "The next area is that of Victoria Street, Limehouse. The Official "Representation of the Medical Officer, dated 3rd October, 1883, comprises "an unhealthy area in the Parish of Shadwell, between High Street and "Cable Street. Your Committee are of opinion it is not a case for the "application of the Artisans, &c. Dwellings Acts, but that many of the "Sanitary defects could be remedied under the Nuisances Removal Acts and "Torrens Acts. The houses in Angel Gardens, in the centre of the area, "appear to be fairly well lighted and ventilated with sufficient spaces at the "rear, and your Committee see no necessity for the preparation of a scheme "for the improvement of the site. They beg to recommend:— "That the Medical Officer for the Limehouse District and the Secretary "of State be informed that in the opinion of the Board the area comprised in "the Official Representation of the Medical Officer, dated 3rd October, 1883, "is not within the scope of the Artisans, &c. Dwellings Acts, but should be "dealt with by some other means, and that the attention of the Limehouse “District Board be called to the defective Sanitary condition of the area." 9 On 25th July, at a Meeting of the Metropolitan Board, a Resolution was passed in accord with this recommendation. "No doubt the Metropolitan Board are quite right in saying that many of the Sanitary defects could be remedied under the Nuisances Removal Acts, and Torrens Acts, but I contend that not only many but all could be remedied, and far more effectually under the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Acts, 1875-82. "The Nuisances Removal Act is useful enough in remedying certain structural defects, but you cannot under its provisions improve the approaches or render houses built back to back healthy, or widen courts, or pull down and rebuild old houses, or raise the level of an area. The Nuisances Removal Act has been in very frequent operation in the area in question, as you will easily understand when I tell you that during the last 3½ years more than 250 Notices to remedy Sanitary defects have been served there, and for the most part complied with. "I have frequently been met with the observation when speaking of the unsanitary condition of houses and their unfitness for human habitation, "But you possess considerable powers of closure under the 13th Section of the Nuisances Removal Act." Theoretically we do, but practically, I am afraid our powers in this direction arc extremely limited, at least, such has been my experience. "I cannot help thinking that the need of re-construction in the area must have been very evident to the Works Committee of the Metropolitan Board, or they would not have recommended the application of Torrens Act, and this recommendation together with the total disregard of the statement in my Representation that diseases indicating a low condition of health among the inhabitants of the area were prevalent, strike me as being weak points in the course taken by the Board. But outside these points there is the evidence afforded by Clause 6 of the Artisans Dwellings Act, 1882, which in my opinion points to Torrens Act as not being suitable for application in this instance. The Clause is as follows:— "Where an Official Representation is made to the Metropolitan Board of Works in pursuance of the Artisans and labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, relates to not more than ten houses the Metropolitan Hoard of Works shall not take any proceedings on such Representation, but shall direct the Officer making the same to report the case to the Local Authority as defined by the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, and it shall be the duty of the Local Authority to deal with such case in manner provided by the last mentioned Act and the Acts amending the same. "Now the unhealthy area in question contains 115 houses, and it appears to me that by implication this section of the Act casts upon the Metropolitan Board the duty of clearing it, and I contend that it is no answer to my Representation under such circumstances to recommend the employment of Torrens Act for the clearance of the area. "In conclusion, I beg to state that in my opinion it is a matter for regret and surprise that the Metropolitan Board do not consider the area comprised in my Official Representation within the scope of the Artisans &c. Dwellings Acts, and I submit that the facts and figures I have laid before you fully warrant me in having made that Representation. "G. A. ROGERS, " Medical Officer of Health for the " Limehouse District. "October 22nd, 1884. 10 Cow and Slaughter Houses. These structures were again licensed after conforming with the requirements of your Board, a list of licensees with addresses is contained in the Appendix. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. One hundred and three samples of Food and Drugs were examined at the Boards Laboratory. Of those 2 were Sweet Spirits of Nitre one of which did not satisfy the requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia. Eight were Mustards, of which 1 was adulterated with flour and coloured with Turmeric. Four were Coffees, of which one was admixed with Chicory. Sixteen were Milks, of which four were mixed with water. Eight were Butters, of which 3 were largely adulterated with foreign fat. And four were Cocoas, of which two were adulterated with Sago Starch. The remaining Samples consisting of Bread, Arrowroot, Gin, Quinine, Beer, Ale, Flour, Pepper, Condensed Milk, Powdered Rhubarb, Whiskey, Flour and Vinegar were genuine. I have pleasure in acknowledging the great assistance I have received from the Inspectors who have carried out my instructions in an intelligent and satisfactory manner. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. Board's Offices:— White Horse Street, October, 1885. 11 TABLE I.
